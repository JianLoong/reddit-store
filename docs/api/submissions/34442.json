I said no and my brother followed. My mom decided we should discuss it some more in family therapy and we went for a few months, then we had no therapy when stuff closed down, and then we returned when in office therapy was back on the table. Throughout the stay in place order my mom would ask us about our feelings and if we were more open to the idea.\n\nRecently my mom decided to try the divide and conquer way since the therapist mentioned that my brother said no because I was. She tried talking to my brother and he was adamant he would say no as long as I'm saying no.\n\nMom then sat me down and asked me why I was saying no. She told me she had a few very practical reasons to want the adoption to happen, including protection for us if she were to die so we could stay with her husband. I asked her if that was because she knew I would want my extended family to fight for custody and to live with them but because she doesn't like them she wouldn't want that and knew my decision would carry some more weight unless I was adopted first. She denied it initially but then said yes. Then asked me why I was against the adoption. I told her I didn't want another legal dad and did not want the protection being adopted would offer.\n\nShe then told me about my brother saying no because I'm saying no and she wanted me to agree so he would change his mind. I told her that won't happen and nothing she says will change my mind. She asked me to at least encourage him to be adopted and I told her I would not.\n\nI did speak to my brother anyway and he said he doesn't want to do it if I'm not and it would feel weird to him to be adopted by Jared when I'm not. He doesn't remember our dad so the attachment isn't a reason for him like it is for me. I told him I wouldn't be mad at him if he said yeah. He said he knew that but still.\n\nMom and Jared sat me down and asked me again to say yes so he could adopt my brother and once again I said no. Mom started to cry and she got really angry with me. Jared said I was at the age where I could be mature and compromise on this. He told me I might not love him but surely I don't hate him so much that I would rather end up in foster care than in his care if mom died.

Is she unwell?", "NTA. The next time they mention you being mature enough tell them they should be mature enough to respect your answer is NO.", "If your mom died - your brother would possibly not end up in the same house as you. He would rather stay with you than his step dad. He would rather have some of his original family than just the new guy. And that's OK.\n\nYou're NTA. There are so many posts about parents trying to force children to accept adoption or call step parents Mum or Dad. It's so bizarre to me and it's a weird kind of pressure. Make a plan of where you'd like to stay if the worst happens, clear it with that family (it might even be with Jared if that's what you choose, just not as his legal daughter, or with other family) and then present the plan to your mother. I think your brother needs some reassurance too that no matter what happens, you're not leaving him. You clearly both care about each other a lot, but he still might need to know that officially and see a plan is in place if the worst happens.", "You were asked, you answered.  They need to accept your decision.\n\nNTA", "NTA and your mother is doing you a huge disservice by putting so much pressure on you. She acknowledged that the reason she's pushing so hard to have Jared in a place to assume custody if something happens to her is because she doesn't want you to go to the other (I assume your bio dad's) side of the family, which is what you would want. At 16, you are old enough to make that decision for yourself.\n\n You told your younger brother you wouldn't be upset if he chose to be adopted. If you meant that sincerely, you've been more than fair. Mom and Jared need to drop it with you.", "NTA. Your mom needs to accept your decision. She is being selfish, and I do get it. She wants you with Jared if anything happens to her. But, that's not what you want. I think at this point, she has to respect your decision. I don't think she will stop trying with your brother, though. He's younger. You'll be 18 soon, and he will be under their roof without you if you go to college. She will keep pressuring him once you are out of the house.", "NTA.\n\nYou absolutely can just say no uiu don\u2019t want to he isn\u2019t your dad. But I\u2019m also not sure where you are but their argument doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. I work with teenagers around your age, some have been in the situation of losing both parents. I have never seen one removed from a step-parent to foster care unless the step-parent refused to take them. Given the shortage of foster homes in many places they aren\u2019t likely to insist without an adoption. I\u2019d nothing else it saves them money and paperwork. \n\nIt\u2019s also far more likely that protocols dictate that they find your living relatives before foster care. So the family you clearly like and she doesn\u2019t would be asked before foster care. That\u2019s all assuming anything happened in the next 2 years, after that you would become your brother\u2019s next of kin if your mother died. Check those rules out in your area so you have some clear facts next time they try to use emotional blackmail.\n\nIn terms of your step-father is he aware that he is implying he would kick you both out if there\u2019s no legal obligation to care for you. That this isn\u2019t likely to encourage you to trust him with either of your care.", "NTA. Do not give in!!!! Only 2 more years big fella and you can get outta there! I would counter their argument and tell them since they are so worried they should let you get a job to start saving. And then at 18 you can leave and your brother will always have a place to stay if you want that.", "NTA. They\u2019re being ridiculous and looking at worst case scenario. Is your mom dying or something? Why are they putting so much pressure on you and your brother to be adopted by your moms new husband. You are old enough to have a choice and so is your brother. Your mum and step dad need to accept that and move on.", "Is your Mom planning on dying soon? You're almost old enough where the choice won't matter anymore (for you) and, even if you did, if you have family that would take you in, you have options if that scenario ever plays out. Either way, it just sounds like your Mom hates your family and wants to keep you and your brother away from them for whatever reason. If you don't want this guy to adopt you, then don't let him.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nNot the slightest.\n\nThis is your name, your future, your identity and all of it. And I mean.. different countries different rules, but where I'm from there are a lot more options than \"Adopted parents or foster care\". There are not THAT many foster care possibilities that every child is just yeeted that way. The thing that normally is done when children are without a parent is the state/wellfare/whoever is in charge will be looking for a guardian within family, close friends or new spouses. If he is a father figure to you and you want so stay and he wants the two of you to stay all is well. Those things can also be put into a will. BUT should you not wish to stay with Jared, that should also be discussed openly because if you want to stay with your mothers family, they should know and be asked. You are old enough to decide those things. Both of you are.\n\nI completely understand your mums wish for orderly circumstances in case of her passing, but the two of you brothers are your own people. Should your brother WANT to be adopted, he would say yes. To me it sounds more like he is not sure about what to do so looks to you for a role model because well.. he's not sure what's right for him. As long as he's not sure, he will put the \"blame\" on you. Chances are he does not want to but saying \"I won't until OP does\" is a lot easier because he is relying to you on not giving in. \n\nLast but not least.. they are NOT asking you for a compromise, OP. They are asking you to give in. As per definition\n\n>A compromise is a situation in which people accept something slightly different from what they really want, because of circumstances or because they are considering the wishes of other people.\n\nThey do not wish you to compromise. Compromising on that would be f.e. Jared accepting, that you don't want to be adopted, but putting the arrangments in your mothers will. Or you accepting that your brother wants to be adopted (which he does not seem to want) as you do.", "nta they are deliberately misleading you both and being dishonest.  brace yourself, I lost my mind reading this, because I was also pressured into being adopted at your age, when my mom passed, only in my case it was almost immediately after she died.  So it's gonna be a little ranty, but you really should pay attention.\n\nDoes your therapist know that whatever is being said in the sessions, she is using to weaponize her arguments and try to pressure you? 'oh brother won't be adopted cause you said no, you should just be adopted, so he will' \n\n You might want to pass on a message about what's going on with the brother, either in front of her if you feel safe from her taking it out on you later, or by calling the office when neither of them are there, or during a recess during school hours to let them know what's going on, with a promise of privacy. The receptionist can take a message and let therapist know what you said, if therapist is unavailable, after stressing privacy concerns.\n\n\"I could be mature and compromise on this\"\n\nthere is no compromise on adoption. You can't 'half adopt' someone. They clearly have motives they are not being open about.\n\n\"He told me I might not love him but surely I don't hate him so much that I would rather end up in foster care than in his care if mom died.\" \n\nYou don't have to HATE someone to not want to be adopted by them. You just have to love them enough to WANT to, and that is not happening here.\n\n\n\"rather end up in foster care than in his care if mom died. He also said I am putting my brother at risk.\"\n\nDefinitely more misleading, it not an outright lie. Your mother has already admitted that she was scared you would end up with a relative if she died. Why would she be 'scared' ?\n\n1. Are your relatives not good people? Have they done something so awful it has not been revealed to you yet, being a minor? \n\n2. Is this a spite tactic? Does she hate them that much, that she would deny them a relationship with you, after they already lost your dad and then her? \n\n3. It sounds more like they just want your younger brother, and more impressionable, and are ok using YOU to make it happen, with no regards to your feelings. \n\n4. There might be money reasons involved. Did someone leave you a trust to care for you both? Is she drawing support from some fund, like a survivor's fund, for the both of you? Does she have an insurance policy on herself for you guys in the event something happens? Any of these would be motivation for her to keep that money coming in, for HIM. It could be that she has insurance policies on both of you, that they would receive in the event anything happens to you guys. Then again, this might not be money motivated at all.\n\nThe most important reason not to be adopted is that you are feeling unsure, and you should always trust your gut feelings, especially since you are being manipulated and misled, and being used as a tool to manipulate someone else.\n\nBuild up a relationship with your relatives, if you haven't already. Dad's side, Mom's side, whomever you can find. Has she tried to isolate you from your Dad's side? You definitely need to talk to someone about what's going on, who would have an interest in you both, if she suddenly passes.", "Tell Jared he's at an age where he should be mature enough to not throw a fit when he doesn't get what he wants", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your brother is only 13. Indeed if something has to happen to her the man how has raised you and your brother as a father figure will have 0 power in the hand of the law. And some nasty battles, or even just nightmare paperwork can ensure for custody. I think she is only thinking for what is best for you and your brother on the legal terms. Also in case Jared dies having you has his legal son will guarantee you a smooth succession of anything he leaves behind. \nYou are every right to feel has you feel, but you are still young and do not probably see the whole legal ramifications of what she is trying to prevent.
