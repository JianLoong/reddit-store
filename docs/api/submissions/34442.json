She told me she had a few very practical reasons to want the adoption to happen, including protection for us if she were to die so we could stay with her husband.

The next time they mention you being mature enough tell them they should be mature enough to respect your answer is NO.", "If your mom died - your brother would possibly not end up in the same house as you. He would rather stay with you than his step dad. He would rather have some of his original family than just the new guy. And that's OK.\n\nYou're NTA. There are so many posts about parents trying to force children to accept adoption or call step parents Mum or Dad. It's so bizarre to me and it's a weird kind of pressure. Make a plan of where you'd like to stay if the worst happens, clear it with that family (it might even be with Jared if that's what you choose, just not as his legal daughter, or with other family) and then present the plan to your mother. I think your brother needs some reassurance too that no matter what happens, you're not leaving him. You clearly both care about each other a lot, but he still might need to know that officially and see a plan is in place if the worst happens.", "You were asked, you answered.  They need to accept your decision.\n\nNTA", "NTA and your mother is doing you a huge disservice by putting so much pressure on you. She acknowledged that the reason she's pushing so hard to have Jared in a place to assume custody if something happens to her is because she doesn't want you to go to the other (I assume your bio dad's) side of the family, which is what you would want. At 16, you are old enough to make that decision for yourself.\n\n You told your younger brother you wouldn't be upset if he chose to be adopted. If you meant that sincerely, you've been more than fair. Mom and Jared need to drop it with you.", "NTA. Your mom needs to accept your decision. She is being selfish, and I do get it. She wants you with Jared if anything happens to her. But, that's not what you want. I think at this point, she has to respect your decision. I don't think she will stop trying with your brother, though. He's younger. You'll be 18 soon, and he will be under their roof without you if you go to college. She will keep pressuring him once you are out of the house.", "NTA.\n\nYou absolutely can just say no uiu don\u2019t want to he isn\u2019t your dad. But I\u2019m also not sure where you are but their argument doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. I work with teenagers around your age, some have been in the situation of losing both parents. I have never seen one removed from a step-parent to foster care unless the step-parent refused to take them. Given the shortage of foster homes in many places they aren\u2019t likely to insist without an adoption. I\u2019d nothing else it saves them money and paperwork. \n\nIt\u2019s also far more likely that protocols dictate that they find your living relatives before foster care. So the family you clearly like and she doesn\u2019t would be asked before foster care. That\u2019s all assuming anything happened in the next 2 years, after that you would become your brother\u2019s next of kin if your mother died. Check those rules out in your area so you have some clear facts next time they try to use emotional blackmail.\n\nIn terms of your step-father is he aware that he is implying he would kick you both out if there\u2019s no legal obligation to care for you. That this isn\u2019t likely to encourage you to trust him with either of your care.", "NTA. Do not give in!!!! Only 2 more years big fella and you can get outta there! I would counter their argument and tell them since they are so worried they should let you get a job to start saving. And then at 18 you can leave and your brother will always have a place to stay if you want that.", "NTA. They\u2019re being ridiculous and looking at worst case scenario. Is your mom dying or something? Why are they putting so much pressure on you and your brother to be adopted by your moms new husband. You are old enough to have a choice and so is your brother. Your mum and step dad need to accept that and move on.", "Is your Mom planning on dying soon? You're almost old enough where the choice won't matter anymore (for you) and, even if you did, if you have family that would take you in, you have options if that scenario ever plays out. Either way, it just sounds like your Mom hates your family and wants to keep you and your brother away from them for whatever reason. If you don't want this guy to adopt you, then don't let him.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nNot the slightest.\n\nThis is your name, your future, your identity and all of it. And I mean.. different countries different rules, but where I'm from there are a lot more options than \"Adopted parents or foster care\". There are not THAT many foster care possibilities that every child is just yeeted that way. The thing that normally is done when children are without a parent is the state/wellfare/whoever is in charge will be looking for a guardian within family, close friends or new spouses. If he is a father figure to you and you want so stay and he wants the two of you to stay all is well. Those things can also be put into a will. BUT should you not wish to stay with Jared, that should also be discussed openly because if you want to stay with your mothers family, they should know and be asked. You are old enough to decide those things. Both of you are.\n\nI completely understand your mums wish for orderly circumstances in case of her passing, but the two of you brothers are your own people. Should your brother WANT to be adopted, he would say yes. To me it sounds more like he is not sure about what to do so looks to you for a role model because well.. he's not sure what's right for him. As long as he's not sure, he will put the \"blame\" on you. Chances are he does not want to but saying \"I won't until OP does\" is a lot easier because he is relying to you on not giving in. \n\nLast but not least.. they are NOT asking you for a compromise, OP. They are asking you to give in. As per definition\n\n>A compromise is a situation in which people accept something slightly different from what they really want, because of circumstances or because they are considering the wishes of other people.\n\nThey do not wish you to compromise. Compromising on that would be f.e. Jared accepting, that you don't want to be adopted, but putting the arrangments in your mothers will. Or you accepting that your brother wants to be adopted (which he does not seem to want) as you do.", "nta they are deliberately misleading you both and being dishonest.  brace yourself, I lost my mind reading this, because I was also pressured into being adopted at your age, when my mom passed, only in my case it was almost immediately after she died.  So it's gonna be a little ranty, but you really should pay attention.\n\nDoes your therapist know that whatever is being said in the sessions, she is using to weaponize her arguments and try to pressure you? 'oh brother won't be adopted cause you said no, you should just be adopted, so he will' \n\n You might want to pass on a message about what's going on with the brother, either in front of her if you feel safe from her taking it out on you later, or by calling the office when neither of them are there, or during a recess during school hours to let them know what's going on, with a promise of privacy. The receptionist can take a message and let therapist know what you said, if therapist is unavailable, after stressing privacy concerns.\n\n\"I could be mature and compromise on this\"\n\nthere is no compromise on adoption. You can't 'half adopt' someone. They clearly have motives they are not being open about.\n\n\"He told me I might not love him but surely I don't hate him so much that I would rather end up in foster care than in his care if mom died.\" \n\nYou don't have to HATE someone to not want to be adopted by them. You just have to love them enough to WANT to, and that is not happening here.\n\n\n\"rather end up in foster care than in his care if mom died. He also said I am putting my brother at risk.\"\n\nDefinitely more misleading, it not an outright lie. Your mother has already admitted that she was scared you would end up with a relative if she died. Why would she be 'scared' ?\n\n1. Are your relatives not good people? Have they done something so awful it has not been revealed to you yet, being a minor? \n\n2. Is this a spite tactic? Does she hate them that much, that she would deny them a relationship with you, after they already lost your dad and then her? \n\n3. It sounds more like they just want your younger brother, and more impressionable, and are ok using YOU to make it happen, with no regards to your feelings. \n\n4. There might be money reasons involved. Did someone leave you a trust to care for you both? Is she drawing support from some fund, like a survivor's fund, for the both of you? Does she have an insurance policy on herself for you guys in the event something happens? Any of these would be motivation for her to keep that money coming in, for HIM. It could be that she has insurance policies on both of you, that they would receive in the event anything happens to you guys. Then again, this might not be money motivated at all.\n\nThe most important reason not to be adopted is that you are feeling unsure, and you should always trust your gut feelings, especially since you are being manipulated and misled, and being used as a tool to manipulate someone else.\n\nBuild up a relationship with your relatives, if you haven't already. Dad's side, Mom's side, whomever you can find. Has she tried to isolate you from your Dad's side? You definitely need to talk to someone about what's going on, who would have an interest in you both, if she suddenly passes.", "Tell Jared he's at an age where he should be mature enough to not throw a fit when he doesn't get what he wants", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Every parent, when they write a will or make arrangements in case something should happen to them, needs to appoint a guardian for their kids anyway. And often it's NOT another parent (in case something should happen to both parents), but another family member, close family friend, etc. Your mother's \"practical reason\" is nonsense.\n\nHer husband can absolutely be listed as the person she wants to take care of you in case of her death or other incapacitation. Hell, he can even become your legal guardian alongside her NOW, while she is still alive, without adopting you (and without having to change your birth certificate, etc.).

Depending where you live, you might be old enough to have some say in whether you can stay with another family member anyways.  Also, the odds of something happening to your mother in the next few years are probably pretty small.

Wow.", "EDIT:   I\u2019m coming from a place of my dad dying and not being protected from the fallout AT ALL. It\u2019s an awful, horrible experience, and if I could go back in time and do something \u2014 *anything* \u2014 to change it so I was better protected, I would do it. My dad is dead. He isn\u2019t a name on a piece of paper, he isn\u2019t a name, he was a person, and he\u2019s gone. Nothing is going to change that or bring him back. He would want me to be protected, and I know if he could see what happened because we didn\u2019t have good protections after his death, he would have wanted me to be adopted by someone else, if that\u2019s what it took. I wouldn\u2019t be thrilled with it either, but it would be better than the post-death fallout. \n\n\u2014-\n\nThis is complicated, and much of what other comments is saying is incorrect. **If he adopted you, it would give you the CHOICE of staying with him. It would not force you to stay with him.**\n\nYour mom is right. You would likely not be able to stay with her husband if anything happened to her. You are not property. She cannot leave you to him in her will. You and your brother could very possibly be split up, and things could get messy. I would do some research on the foster care system, etc. You\u2019d probably have to switch schools, your brother would likely have to switch schools. You\u2019d both have to leave all your friends. Your relatives may not be willing to take you in. Raising a kid is expensive. There are major financial issues involved. You say you \u201cdon\u2019t want the protection being adopted would offer,\u201d but do you know what that protection is? Protection is a big deal. Being out on your own sucks. It\u2019s harder than you think.\n\nYou haven\u2019t mentioned any reasons why you are not okay with it. You\u2019ve mentioned your mom has some very practical reasons. Sometimes we do things because of practical reasons. That\u2019s what being a grown-up is. Your mom is trying to protect you and your brother. \n\nThis is a (very) soft Y T A (edit: on the basis of it seeming like you haven\u2019t looked into what might happen if anything happens to your mom. At least make an educated decision). My dad is dead, and my parents were in a messy custody battle when I was younger, so I\u2019m fully aware of all the complicated feelings and issues that come with this issue. You are allowed to have whatever feelings you have about it. However, you are older than your brother and potentially influencing him about something that could have major ramifications for him if anything ever happened to your mom. It sounds like this is purely for protection vs. your mom or stepdad trying to get you or your brother to feel a certain way. You\u2019ve been refusing to consider this proposition. Consider it. Seriously think about it. Do some research on the foster system and what would happen to you or your brother if anything ever happened to your mom. Make an educated decision. \n\nYou certainly don\u2019t have to change your last name if you don\u2019t want to. You can also always change it back later if you want. This man isn\u2019t replacing your dad. He will never replace your dad. He\u2019d be a legal caregiver and is willing to take care of you if anything were to happen to your mom. That\u2019s a big deal, and while I completely understand the teenager side of things, the adult side is important. Being a teenager sucks because your brain is still growing and you get access to a lot more information, but your brain is still working on juggling all that information. Sometimes we have to have faith in the adults we know love and care for us. It sounds like your mom is trying to protect you, and it\u2019s worth seriously considering what she has to say, which it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s also not okay to influence your brother with your personal decision when he has much more to lose here.", "Yes.

You also said that potentially if anything happened to your mum you had other relatives that you would want to stay with and have them take custody of you while you\u2019re still a minor, but your mum doesn\u2019t get along with them so she doesn\u2019t want this option.\n\nHave you ever discussed this with the relatives you mentioned? Would they be ok with taking you in and adopting you if something happened to your mum? Maybe get an answer to this before going back to your mum.\n\nTwo things I find odd here:\n\n1) Why are they so invested in the potential scenario that your mum will die and you\u2019ll need to go under her partners custody? Does she have a terminal illness or something? If it is not something like there is a very high chance she may die within the next few years then their fixation is really weird.\n\n2) I get that he is only 13, but your brother not giving any reason other than he will choose what you choose is very immature.

If he had said that if something did happen he wanted to stay with you and go wherever you went it would be more understandable, but he is giving a crappy take-no-responsibility response that basically puts all of the pressure, anger and disappointment from your mum onto your back, instead of actually making a decision based on what he actually wants.

No judge is going to hand over kids to a stepfather who isn't liked by those kids, over handing them over to the kids' biological family.\n\nEdit: to clarify, legal adoption would mean the stepfather is treated in law as the biological father, which is why OP's mother seems to be so desperate to push the adoption through. We don't know the details - the mother's family may be abusive - but we should be suspicious about the motivations of a mother who marries another man and tries to impose that man on her children as \"their new dad\".", "They can get stepdad legal guardianship through the courts.

We made a decision (us & our kids) to add him to our wills as an equal heir, same as our 2 other kids.

I would sit down with a piece of paper and work through pros and cons and really stew in the decision making process. Maybe ask your mom why she doesn\u2019t want you with these other family members. Is it because they have no morals and values, is it because of something awful that happened in the past such as abuse with these family members, is it because they aren\u2019t good people, are there drugs involved?

Sexual abuse, physical abuse, financial abuse, emotional abuse, drugs, addictions, mental disorders etc may be things she is choosing to shield you from because at the end of the day your mother is showing tremendous love for you. Not a lot of parents are even this remotely close to being transparent with their kids, nor do they care if their kids end up in foster care.

I am not a person with any type of knowledge about policies, but could this be it? Could it have to do with the terms of the trust or your dads life insurance policy ( some policies are held by the insurance company until the beneficiary is a certain age- usually 18/21, etc). I mean, if both you and your brother are adopted, does that mean you\u2019re no longer legally his child and therefore no longer his next of kin and all the money would revert to your mom?

Mom's desire to play happy family seems to have clouded her ability to understand what she's really asking you to give up. \n      If Jared is the dad your brother has always wanted and needed then your brother will eventually want to be adopted. This is where Jared's efforts should be and this is what your mom should support and encourage. \n        My Dad adopted me but my bio father signed away his rights. I know that when my Dad came into my life I got a gift beyond measure. I have a half sister that was born after me.

We both feel the pain of that abandonment still and we're in our fifties. The difference for me though is that I still have my wonderful Dad, in his seventies now, and the best a girl could ask for. \n      Maybe tell your Mom and Jared my story and tell Jared to be the Dad your brother needs without asking anything of either of you. If Jared is a wonderful father to your brother there will come a day that your brother will want Jared to adopt him, but that continually harping on you will drive a deep wedge into that relationship and your brother will be much less likely to want to be adopted. \n       IMHO They're putting the cart before the horse, build the relationship the rest will come  along.", "Ding ding ding!", "This is exactly what I am thinking!", "In my country this is how it works too.
