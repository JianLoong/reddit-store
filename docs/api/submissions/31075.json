Lulu didn't want that because she'll look \"poor\" in front of her friends plus she ONLY needed to borrow $8K.\n\nI said no . I can't lend her money to continue her trip but I can lend her a ticket home.  She yelled at me about being selfish and hung up on me.

Nice little scam your parents and sister tried to run on you. Luckily, you called their bluff. Your parents 'didn't want to give her money', not that they couldn't. They didn't want to.

You\u2019ve offered help and if you want to protect yourself message a family gc or create one if one doesn\u2019t exist and make it clear your position on help and what you\u2019ve offered and put the ball in your parents, siblings or extended families court to help otherwise if they want to fund the trip.
