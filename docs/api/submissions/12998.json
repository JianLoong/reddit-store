Junior didn't bother me but when it was Malcolm and Mal and Malcolm Jr my husband spoke up. They said it was just a fun little thing, that he is the first grandson and the first in generations to not get the name. He said we don't want him to be a junior. They assured us it would stop.

I responded that she was entitled to her opinion and it was a good thing she didn't need to be around us when she feels that way.\n\nThen both MIL and SIL showed up at home while my husband was at work. I answered the door and they said we were being over the top over a name, and what was the harm in them calling our son the name he should have been given. I told him there was no name he should have been given. That we gave him a name we loved and felt would serve him well and that name was not my husband's name, that he is not another junior and they should learn to accept that. They yelled that I was being too controlling and rejecting a perfectly good name and destroying a family tradition. I shut the door in their face.

You and your husband need to set some strong boundaries with his family. Their behavior is tacky and unacceptable.

They didn\u2019t help create the baby so they get no say.\n\nInform them of these boundaries in writing and put them in immediate time out every time they break one. \n\nCall your son the wrong name at a gathering?  Correct them and pack up and leave. Block contact for X amount of days. \n\nShow up unannounced?  Do not answer the door and block contact for X number of days. \n\nConsistency is key for this to be effective.
