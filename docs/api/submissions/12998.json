The name was not popular among my husband's family. They have a long tradition of Jr's. My husband, his dad, his grandpa, great grandpa and great great grandpa all have the same first and middle name. We broke from tradition with our son. With my husband's strong encouragement and support. Nobody really said much when he was first born. We did notice some looks from his mom and sister especially but as long as they weren't telling us to change it then it's whatever.\n\nAbout a month and a half ago they started to call my son Malcolm and Junior. Junior didn't bother me but when it was Malcolm and Mal and Malcolm Jr my husband spoke up. They said it was just a fun little thing, that he is the first grandson and the first in generations to not get the name. He said we don't want him to be a junior. They assured us it would stop. But it didn't. My husband told them we should take a break from each other since they were incapable of accepting our son's name and continued to disrespect the choice we made by calling him what they wished we had named him.\n\nSIL sent me a FB message not long after saying it was a dumb name and we ruined our son's life by naming him after a band, especially a band who nobody his age will have heard of. I responded that she was entitled to her opinion and it was a good thing she didn't need to be around us when she feels that way.\n\nThen both MIL and SIL showed up at home while my husband was at work. I answered the door and they said we were being over the top over a name, and what was the harm in them calling our son the name he should have been given. I told him there was no name he should have been given. That we gave him a name we loved and felt would serve him well and that name was not my husband's name, that he is not another junior and they should learn to accept that. They yelled that I was being too controlling and rejecting a perfectly good name and destroying a family tradition. I shut the door in their face. They called my husband's work line and said I was rude to them and super controlling. He told me to ignore them.
