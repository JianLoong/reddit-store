{"id": 1255, "submission_id": "ym72us", "title": "AITA for going on a Discord call while telling my dad I went to study?", "selftext": "I\u2019m(17F) going to university and currently in my first week of exams. Today was a day without exams, so I had already studied earlier in the day. After dinner and doing my share of the chores, I decided to watch TV with my dad(53M) before reviewing stuff. I saw that some friends were on a discord call and decided to join, I could handle that on top of reviewing. I hadn't talked to them in a while and wanted to know how they were doing. My dad heard me talking from downstairs. I told him about the call, and he went back to watching TV.\n\nI later hear him coming up the stairs and guess that he wants to know who I'm talking to, cause he always wants to know who my brother(13M) and I are talking to when we're on the phone with someone. So I opened the call to show him if he came to ask and to switch off my mic cause my friends don\u2019t know my dad. As I predicted he came into my room and asked who I was talking to. I said some friends and showed him the screen, he looked down to see something, probably the names of the people in the call, got mad at me and demanded I closed it. I ended the call and went back to my study material, thinking that that would be fine as I usually have discord open as I also use it for school, but I needed to close discord, I did and asked if he was happy.\n\nHe went off saying that I went behind his back cause I had told him I was going to study and this wasn\u2019t looking, that if I continued he was going to take my electronics and I could figure out on my own how to do my study then, that he wasn\u2019t going to keep putting his hard-earned money into it when I\u2019m doing stuff like that, that I needed to make a choice and that he won\u2019t help me financially anymore or drive me to places (it\u2019s illegal to drive before 18) if I continue to do this. He then went downstairs, when he was on the stairs he said that he helped me a few days ago and that I was ungrateful towards him, I told him that I was grateful to him, but he said that I was lying.\n\nI decided to open discord back up to let my friend know why I disappeared. She was surprised at what happened and didn\u2019t understand it either.\n\nMy dad came back upstairs 18 min later and told me that I was still doing it, that he was no longer going to support me financially and that I need to find another way to get to rehearsal cause he was no longer going to take me. That I needed to start working and that if I needed to take a taxi then I should do that. That if I continue he will move, sell everything and just leave, letting me fend for myself. He told me he might change his mind if I proof him something, he didn't tell me what.\n\nI told my friend this and she felt really guilty for getting me into this mess when I don't think she could have done anything. 5 min later my dad calls me downstairs to drink, when I got downstairs he ignored that I'm there. I ignored him too cause I'm hurt by this.\n\nAm I the AH for going on a call while I had told my dad I was going to study and not informing him about the call?", "created_utc": 1667587987, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym72us/aita_for_going_on_a_discord_call_while_telling_my/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
