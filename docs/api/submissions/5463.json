{"id": 5463, "submission_id": "ztqi5f", "title": "AITA for asking my brother to accommodate my son at his child-free wedding and refusing to drop it?", "selftext": "A few months ago, my older brother asked me to be his best man and my husband to be a groomsman. He and I have always been close and he was my best man at our (much smaller) ceremony. At the time I committed to this obligation, no real planning had taken place so everyone was on standby waiting for further details and an official date.\n\nI'm not sure when they began properly planning things, but I didn't hear much more about it until November during our Thanksgiving family gathering. My brother's fianc\u00e9e told us the venue, the date, and the fact that the wedding was going to be child-free. Now, I have no issue with the concept of child-free weddings -- I had one myself. The problem is that my husband and I are expecting a baby. If all goes well with our surrogate's pregnancy (fingers crossed), our son will be 3 months old by the wedding date given. The venue they've chosen is one 2.5 hours from where we live. We would likely be spending three days away from home.\n\nYou can call me an overprotective first time parent, but the thought of both my husband and I being away from our child for that long when he's so little scares me, and he's not even here yet. My in-laws could watch him and I trust them completely, but I know I wouldn't be able to properly enjoy the festivities if my infant is over two hours away from me. I pulled my brother aside later in the night and apologized profusely while explaining my worries. He said he understood and offered up a venue change (one much closer to home) or maybe making an exception for me by inviting my in-laws to the wedding, that way I could see the baby during the ceremony and feel a little less stressed. I told him either would work for me and thanked him.\n\nHe spoke to his fianc\u00e9e, but she won't budge on either issue. He's vented to me multiple times over the course of the month that has now passed about how he's really frustrated because what matters most to him is making sure he's surrounded by the people he loves and that they are comfortable. Meanwhile his fianc\u00e9e continually repeats that she's not giving up her 'dream venue and ceremony.'  I told him my husband and I could just attend as guests instead if it would make things easier, but he immediately shut me down and said he wanted us by his side.\n\nShe texted me yesterday (politely, I'll admit) asking if I could please just drop things with my brother. I might have considered it previously, but hearing how she turned down all of my brother's requests for compromise made me put my foot down and refuse. I hate causing my brother trouble like this, especially so close to the holidays, but I feel like she's showing her true colors. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - If I was a guest, I would not have brought this up at all. Both my husband and I being *in the wedding party* is what complicates things. As I said, I\u2019m all for child-free weddings.", "created_utc": 1671823895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztqi5f/aita_for_asking_my_brother_to_accommodate_my_son/", "score": 7981, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Feel free to miss some activities except pics and the ceremony and some (but not all) of the reception.\n\nOr go the day of the wedding and return home that evening, even if it means you'll be missing some of the reception. 2.5 hours is not that significant of travel time where I'm from.\n\nThe bride's unwillingness to compromise is troubling, but you can compromise. It's not your place to submarine the wedding or put your foot down. It's your place to support your brother and take care of your baby and if there is a way you can do both, you should.\n\nSix months after our daughter was born, my hubby and I got a short weekend break with a trip to Vegas while our inlaws watched our baby. We missed her like crazy, but we also enjoyed the break. I don't think I would have been ready for that at 3 months, though. Good luck, and work it out.", "Is there a way that you can rent an air bnb or hotel for your in laws close to the wedding venue, so that you can still be close by? Would they be okay with that?", "Confused. 3 hours away.

That way you're not 2 hours away for the weekend. You can see your kid every day of the festivities.", "Info: Can you bring your in laws with you to where the wedding is and get them and the baby a hotel or an air bnb or something so that the baby isn\u2019t at the wedding but also isn\u2019t hours away from you?", "Info: can your in laws come and stay in the same town as the wedding? Rent a big enough air BNB for everyone?", "Surprised by the YTA. They can\u2019t have it both ways. I\u2019m pretty open to being away from my daughter but would not have been at only 3 months. I would have left her with my husband for a night but no one else. You offered to not be in the wedding, and they won\u2019t accept that. I think that\u2019s completely reasonable. Or maybe just you are in the wedding and your husband stays home?", "Bring your in-laws with you & have them stay with the baby at the hotel during the wedding. This is easily solvable. Don\u2019t be the AH", "I\u2019m with KeepLkngFortintlgnce.  Why can\u2019t you put out your in-laws up at the hotel with the baby?  Problem solved.  But, it\u2019s also your brother\u2019s wedding and his fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t be making decisions based only on her desires. But, you are making this extremely difficult for your brother at a time he should be enjoying making plans.  Put the in-laws up at the hotel if they are willing and be a happy part of your brothers wedding!", "NTA.\n\nAll the Y T A votes make me feel like no one is considering that it sounds like your *brother* is also unhappy with his fiancee's unwillingness to compromise. You offered the compromise of coming as just guests so you don't have to be gone multiple days, which seems most reasonable to me for your part. That upsets your brother, though, as he wants you there beside him for his big day. So your brother, who is *the other half of the couple being married*, offered some compromises that his fiancee is not happy with. She won't compromise her dream venue or her child-free stance for the sake of anyone, not even her future husband.\n\nYes, she has a right to want what she wants for her wedding. But her husband also has a say! It's not just the bride who gets to have a say in the planning! It's not that she's unwilling to compromise for the sake of OP's happiness, she is unwilling to compromise for the happiness of the *person she is marrying*. It does not bode well.", "Well you really can't demand that they (she) accommodate your child at a child free wedding so I say slight YTA for that. The problem is that you offered to drop out so that you could still be there to support them but not for 3 days away from your newborn and that was a lovely non-assholey compromise. I am wondering...can the in-laws come with (you and husband's treat of course) and maybe have an adjoining room with you guys so that you will be with baby before and after the festivities?", "NTA. It's so weird that everyone is ignoring that you offered to just be a guest and your BROTHER wants to accommodate you. It's also weird that your brother's fianc\u00e9 won't compromise with HIM. Her reasons are also very selfish. He wants his family there but she's concerned with a dream venue. Is a wedding about the venue or the love between a couple?? If I was in your brother's shoes, I would think long and hard (\ud83c\udf1d) about marrying her because how incredibly selfish could you be to not even consider a compromise with your partner? The wedding doesn't belong solely to the woman, contrary to what society wants us to believe. It's his wedding too.", "I think I have to go against the grain with a NTA.\nYou made compromises like dropping out of the wedding party, for the weddingto be childsfree. Your brother wants you in the party. It would be unresanable to leave your 3m old alone for multiple days.\n\nIt's on your brother and your FSIL to get their wishes and plans straight.", "NTA, your brother is the groom and it is also his wedding. He wants you to be in his wedding but his fiance seems to think it's all about her. You are just trying to be there for your brother the way he wants you to be there and his fiance is making that impossible.", "So I\u2019m a bit confused by the Y T A votes because he offered to just be a guest? It looks like OP tried to find a compromise and at this point it\u2019s become an issue between OP\u2019s brother and his fianc\u00e9? \n\nNTA because you tried to find a compromise but it\u2019s between them at this point. You offered to be just a guest and your brother said no. Im seeing a lot of suggestions with your in laws in a near by room, at this point would it be easier to get an airbnb and stepping down from some of the party duties?\n\nEdit: she to he, OP didn\u2019t give a gender but I saw others referring to them as a male", "It\u2019s a difficult one as I get why you\u2019d not want to leave your new baby far away. Is there a hotel near by that in-laws could maybe be with the baby so you won\u2019t be so far. I wouldn\u2019t expect the bride to change her venue as it\u2019s her day, BUT, would it be a big deal having a newborn there? It\u2019s not as if the wee one will be running around causing havoc.", "I don\u2019t understand\n\nYou\u2019re likely staying wherever this wedding is, right? Why can\u2019t you pay for your in-laws to stay at the same hotel or close by?\n\nI\u2019m really unable to understand why you\u2019d have a place to stay and in-laws don\u2019t? Why do they need to be invited to the wedding to be close by??\n\nYTA for this weird drama that you\u2019re creating", "NAH- either you or husband will need to drop out of groomsman duties though (husband makes sense as its your brother). 3 months is too young for a multi day babysitter though. Perhaps in-laws can come for a day or two?", "NTA - I'm gonna get downvoted but I don't care.\n\nThe bride and groom need to change their perspective. It's not him against her, it's them against the problem.\n\nYou're not comfy being away from your kid so you wanted to decline. Your brother decided that having you there means more to him then material things.\nYou didn't push, you gave solutions for instance being a guest. \n\nThe bride wants the 'perfect wedding', but at what cost? If the roles were reversed and my fiance prioritised the dream over my family I wouldn't look at him the same. Its their wedding and not only hers. \n\nHOWEVER, time to think together for a solution instead of fighting each other like kids. Maybe book a hotelroom for your in laws nearby. The kid and inlaws don't have to be part of the wedding. The grandparents can have a weekend outting with the grandkid and spend quality time together. While you are at the wedding but still close enough to see the baby regularly.\n\nEdit: someone said I was being too harsh on the bride since she seems to be planning everything while the groom is just sitting there. I actually agree so my apologies. The groom should also start discussing things with the bride before simply deciding to change the venue. What I'm trying to say is communicate people ;)", "YTA\n\nThe accommodations you are asking for are not minor, they are *major*.  While the groom might be willing to acquiesce, it's perfectly reasonable for a bride not to want the VENUE to be changed due to one guests' familial preferences or to have a newborn infant at the ceremony.  I mean, the whole reason people do childfree weddings is to stop children from interrupting the ceremony, and that's all but a guarantee with a newborn.  But hey, you know that.  You opted for a childfree wedding yourself, so you get it.  \n\nFrankly, it sounds like your brother has an issue with wanting to cater to everyone else and not prioritizing his bride's wishes.  She's hardly a bridezilla for wanting to stick to major things they BOTH agreed upon like the venue and it being childfree.  The wedding SHOULD be about the bride and groom.  Not what the guests want. So if your brother's priority is moving heaven and earth for his guests instead of making sure his future spouse is happy with her wedding, then he's the one out of line.   \n\nHonestly, you should have asked for help so your infant could be with you for those 3 days, but not at the ceremony.  Could they help you get your in-laws hotel rooms where you are staying so they can watch the baby? That would have been the ask when she texted you. As a bride myself, a couple hundred out of the wedding budget to help the best man be there for the groom would have been a very doable ask. Heck, I would even have welcomed the in-laws at the various wedding meals (though not the ceremony due to newborns being naturally disruptive).  But depending on how you responded, that door may be closed now.", "NTA. If you didn\u2019t offer to drop out of the wedding party, you\u2019d be TA, but you gave options and none of them were accepted. It\u2019s reasonable for you to not want to leave your infant for several days, considering you\u2019re both in the wedding party. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re getting so many negative judgements, when it seems you were trying to make it work for everyone.", "YTA if you push this. If it really bothers you to be away from your kid then send your regrets.  OR, bring your inlaws along and get them a hotel room to watch the baby.  You'll spend a lot more money, but your baby won't be far from you.", "NTA- people here saying you are the AH are doing for without read properly. They see \"I want to bring my child to a childfree wedding\" and don't read anymore. It's not a reasonable ask to want a parent of a newborn spend three days away from them. You offered the compromise of not being part of the wedding party, but you are valuable to your brother and he doesn't want that. People are reading like you are the one who suggest that they change the venue or being your in-laws. It was your brother. The only problem here is the fianc\u00e9 who is turning down every solution and that shows she doesn't care about her own future husband or his family.", "NTA. Please ask your brother to work out a solution with his fiancee and to let you know. You\u2019ve offered so many solutions, so this is not a matter of your being difficult. Your soon-to-be SIL should not have come to you and asked you to drop it.", "YTA \n\nGet your in laws a room next to yours and maybe shorten the trip. \n\nI don\u2019t feel as though the bride is being mean or unfair by not *changing* the venue entirely. It\u2019s her wedding too, not just your brother\u2019s. She should\u2019ve been included in this convo from the start. \n\nSomeone has to care about the ceremony, venue, and logistics of the wedding. It\u2019s also interesting to me that you had a child free wedding, but her refusing to accommodate your child for her wedding is her \u201cshowing her true colors\u201d.", "Sorry but YTA. Why not have your in-laws come to the hotel with you and just watch baby during the wedding for a few hours? You guys could even go check on baby! That\u2019s what I would do if I were in your position. Huge congratulations!", "Yeah YTA.\n\"I'm fine with childfree weddings but not when it's MY child.\"\nLmao. \nDon't you think other parents might have similar issues?", "YTA, have someone come along and watch the baby in your hotel or wherever you are staying. It\u2019s their big day and having them change the venue is an unreasonable ask. The bride by your own admission is being polite about it, don\u2019t be an ass.", "YTA. You got to have your child free wedding, stop demanding that she give up hers. The wedding isn\u2019t about you so stop causing trouble. Get a room at the hotel for your in-laws and have them stay there with your baby during the wedding. She shouldn\u2019t have to give up the wedding of her dreams over your feelings.", "Yta. As someone who is going through the same thing right now.", "YTA. They\u2019ve likely already paid a deposit that they\u2019d forfeit if they change venue at this point. And you got to have a child free wedding and made others figure out childcare plans to make it happen. Handle it. You\u2019re a parent and this is literally part of parenting. If this is so insurmountable for you then don\u2019t go. But don\u2019t ask them to compromise on their wedding day dreams because of your anxiety. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t have your in laws care for baby at a nearby air bnb and then you are in and out as you\u2019re able to check on things. \n\nHandle it. Don\u2019t expect everyone else to rearrange their plans for you. Ridiculous.", "It pains me to say it but yta. The solution here is to either attend without your husband and child or have your in laws stay in the same town for a few days so you could see baby throughout the weekend. Not inviting your siblings child is always an odd choice to me but i\u2019m obviously in the minority on that", "Unfortunately YTA. It\u2019s their wedding and if they want it to be child free and not make an exception that\u2019s that and you shouldn\u2019t be pushing it. May sound harsh but the day isn\u2019t about you and your husband or your child. It\u2019s probably a big ask but could your in laws travel with you and not attend the wedding to look after your baby?", "I\u2019m going go against others here and actually say NTA. \n\nI had a child free wedding with 1 rule, if the child was under 1, understanding they still need their mom usually then they were welcome to attend. \n\nWe never had any kids show up, we had one friend who was going to attend but their kid was having a hard time bottle feeding so she didn\u2019t make it but he husband did. \n\nBut under 1 is unreasonable IMO to ask parents to leave their kid, especially for 3 days! The brides true colours for family first are showing with her lack of willingness to compromise. \n\nCan you book a hotel room where you will be staying for your in-laws and have them stay for 3 days to watch the baby when needed? \nI don\u2019t agree with them going to the wedding but doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t stay at a hotel where you are to help.", "YTA. \n\nShe's not *showing her true colors \u2014* if anything, you are. She just wants her wedding to be childfree, and she has every right to set that boundary. You are being incredibly entitled and self-centered.", "YTA. And so is your brother for seemingly prioritizing your wants over his future wife. It's ridiculous to expect your sibling to move their venue to accommodate you. Take away the fact that they chose it together for a reason, but they have absolutely already put a deposit down for this venue that they would likely lose by canceling with them. So that's an unreasonable. \n\nYour next \"compromise\" is inviting your in laws and making an exception so they can bring your baby. To a child free wedding. You had a child free wedding yourself, so you of all people should know that once you make an exception for one it's expected you can make it for others. And every mom and dad who had to pay for a sitter are going to be pissed when they see that your baby was allowed to come. Again, unreasonable. \n\nIt's really sad that your brother is backing you on this. This would be a red flag for me, I hope this isn't a pattern of behavior of him putting his family above his fiance and decisions they made together.", "YTA. It's not about you enjoying yourself - it's your brother's day and you are returning the favour he did for you at your own wedding. You're creating unnecessary tension when there is a perfectly good child care solution available at your in-laws'. You could even bring them to the same location and get them a hotel room to mind your child so at least you're seeing him for all but a few hours.", "YTA.  You want your in laws to babysit, pay for a hotel fir them and gave them babysit.  There is no reason they need to be invited to the wedding and there is no reason they can\u2019t babysit at the hotel.  They can face time you during the reception.  Such a hypocrite, I had a child free wedding, but now that I might have a kid, others have to change so their wedding revolves around me.", "NTA\nYou asked.  Answer was no.  Time to pull out of the wedding party and send your regrets.\n\nIf they want to take this child free thing to the end then so be it.  It seems like such a shame to choose that as their hill to die on, but I guess tell them you\u2019ll watch the video \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "When their oldest was 3 1/2 months old, my sister and BIL attended a child free wedding.  I stayed in the nearby hotel with the baby and my sister left the reception to come check on us for a while.", "NTA\u2026I\u2019m assuming I read an edit or something before these y.t.a\u2019s but I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d have to drive down for the rehearsal dinner, stay all day for the ceremony/reception, and then come back the following day.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re offering to go just as guests and only stay the one night and it\u2019s your brother who\u2019s being the hardass for requiring you to be in the party and his fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t compromise for him then it\u2019s their issue, not yours. If you\u2019re not demanding to be in the wedding party and perfectly ok with being just a guest then I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re being an asshole.\n\nThe only thing I can think if you want to be nice is skip the rehearsal dinner (after you\u2019ve been to one wedding you know it requires no planning to walk down the aisle and figure out your cue to walk) and drive down for the day, not drink, and drive back to be back with your child\u2026not saying it wouldn\u2019t be annoying but 2.5 hours is 100% doable and if it means that much to your brother for both of you to be in the wedding you could make it happen without being away from your child for a long period of them there are solutions here", "I'd say NAH.\n\nYou'll have a couple month old baby, it makes sense you wouldn't want to spend that many days away from him. \n\nIt also makes sense that your brother wants you there because you're close and I think it's lovely he's fighting so hard to have you both there.\n\nIt also makes sense that the bride is upset that her wedding may be turning to shambles. Depending on the size of the wedding and timeframe, it's not so simple as to \"change the venue\" and I'd imagine if she's chosen one so far away, there's a big reason why. \n\nIt's a sucky situation but I think everyone involved as their fair reasons for being upset and not wanting to budge. Could you potentially discuss the situation with just the bride? See if she has any ideas on different compromises? \n\nAnother potential, could you pay for the babysitter (your in laws, I believe?) to have their own hotel room?\n\nIf she absolutely refuses to even consider any compromise at all, then she's definitely an AH, but I'd still be inclined to ask why.", "NTA  and all of the people saying otherwise probably don't have the experience of a close family member demanding a 3 day separation from their newborn baby.   I understand that people have different family dynamics, but I can tell you missing my brother's wedding would have set off WWIII in my family.  It's not as simple as just not attending.  \n\nOP and his husband should step down from their wedding party duties and attend as guests, while the in-laws watch their baby for a day.  The brother might be upset, but it is his problem to figure out a compromise, not OP's.  \n\nAnd OP--I just want to give you props for putting your baby and your nuclear family first.  I know you obviously love your brother as well, but you have your priorities straight.", "NAH. But just ask your in laws if they would be willing to stay at a hotel with your kid. That way they are close and you can relax without the bride having to give up her dream.", "NTA. I always get down voted but child-free weddings where you invite close family members seem ridiculous. Children are part of families. They deserve to participate in family events and families are better with them around. There are many things kids shouldn\u2019t go to but a wedding isn\u2019t one of them.", "Wow, I dont think people are even reading the post before throwing out these \"YTA\" judgements.\n\nYou're NTA, but unfortunately that doesn't magically solve the problem. So I think you are going to have to follow the advice of other posters and bring your in-laws along for the trip and keep them nearby.", "I'm actually really surprised by all of the Y T A comments and they all sound like they didn't really read your post. \n\nA lot of people are saying just not to attend or attend simply as guests, which you claimed to have offered as a compromise after explaining why you weren't comfortable leaving your newborn for an extended period of time. Your brother declined and made it clear that he wanted you there as part of the wedding party. At that point, it becomes up to him to figure out how to have you there as part of the wedding. \n\nI feel this is a situation of boundaries more than anything else. You clearly stated your boundary about attending the wedding as the best man/groomsman - accommodation for your baby. Your brother's fiancee asking you to \"drop it,\" reads to me as overstepping that boundary because it doesn't really seem like you're pushing anything (again, you are/were fine with attending as guests), and it is your brother who is pushing the matter as he wants you there by his side (understandably so). Sounds like a relational issue they have to work out that you just happen to be in the middle of. \n\nSome others have suggested bringing along your in-laws, so your baby won't be far. See if your brother may be able to help with that compromise. Either way, NTA. Best of luck and I hope things work out for everyone!", "YTA. Your brother's fiancee isn't the one showing her true colors. You had a child-free wedding and now want an exception carved out because it's your kid. Either hire a sitter and fortify yourself with some Xanax or apologize and drop from the wedding party so you can be with your new kid. Stop trying to make your brother's wedding about you.", "YTA. Don't get me wrong, I do understand, but they are allowed to have a child free wedding and do not have to accommodate you. You're the one who needs to do the accommodating. When my college friend had her wedding, and I had no choice to bring the kids, they stayed in the hotel nearby with my sister. Having your in-laws come with and handling your baby nearby would absolutely be a good way for everyone to get what they want - but instead you want to invalidate the Bride and cause discord for her wanting to have her one day.", "YTA\n\nThis is their wedding. It's child free. They don't need to make an exception for you, and if they did, it would be a slap in the face to other parents attending in a similar situation. It's child free for a reason. \n\nIt is their wedding. They don't need to work it around your needs. You said you have someone who can babysit and you'll just have to manage your anxiety. If you wanna go, again, it is THEIR wedding and their rules.", "YTA. There's a lot of ways to solve this that don't involve you abandoning your small child for three days. Bring a babysitter with you. Find a local babysitter. Go back-n-gettem the next day? It's not that far. Don't become someone's problem at their wedding.", "YTA. You're not special.", "YTA\n\nyour sister-in-law to be asks if you \"could please just drop things with my brother\" regarding asking him to completely change the entire wedding to suit you. \n\n>hearing how she turned down all of my brother's requests for compromise **made me put my foot down and refuse.**\n\nYTA, many times over. \n\nIf you can't be comfortable with alternative arrangements you can make yourself to attend someone else's function, then... just don't go. Goading your brother into changing things around to suit you is AH, thinking you have any standing to \"put your foot down\"... even more so. \n\nIt's a wedding.

I'm childfree, had a childfree wedding, and you've agreed to compromise but your brother wants you there. This is an issue of the bride wanting a wedding and not a marriage. Get a room nearby for the in laws and you can check on your baby periodically through the festivities.", "YTA\n\nYou are not the main character of his story. You had the wedding you wanted, let them have theirs. If that means you chose the baby and stay home, that\u2019s fine. And brother would have no room to complain. \n\nStop being dramatic. Stop making demands. Stop expecting other people to cave to you for your own convenience.", "YTA and it\u2019s sad that your FSIL can\u2019t enjoy her wedding planning because of you.

It\u2019s gross!", "YTA-I can admit that I get where you're coming from but this is not your wedding it is hers and this is the most important time of her life. We all know women hold a different view on weddings we grew up being taught that. She wants her perfect wedding at her perfect venue just let her have that.  Not to mention it sounds like she has been really respectful about this whole thing  but I do think you are wrong to keep bring it up when she already said she wasn't budging. Idk if you cam realize this but all you are doing is adding extra stress to her and u are causing a conflict between your brother and his fiance", "YTA especially since you had a child free wedding yourself, like talk about being entitled and a hypocrite. Your poor FSIL has now to contend with you causing conflict between her and your brother.\n\nI'm saying all this as someone who went to a wedding about same distance as your brothers 3 weeks after actually giving birth! Yeah it's completely different and way more intense way of becoming a parent so don't even pick on this. You know what I did? I left my baby with their other parent.\n\nSo if you don't want to leave your baby with in laws then go to the wedding yourself and do vid calls ooorrr have the inlaws book into hotel near by and you can all relax with the baby near by.\n\nBut for the love of God stop making this about you and your baby, the baby is only the most precious thing in the world to you not your FSIL.", "I was determined to have a child free wedding ceremony, but littles were welcome at the reception. I would have made arrangements for a sitter in the church nursery, but it turned out only my niece and nephew were involved.

It's their day, they want a child free wedding. It's one day.\n\nEdit for clarification, the wedding is one day.

There are plenty of alternative solutions that don't involve compromise.", "Congratulations on your new addition!\n\nYTA though.\n\nChild free is child free. You are the AH for not letting it go. Your brother loves you and wants you there. His fiancee doesn't want him put in the middle. She knows that one exception will lead to questions and resentment from other guests.\n\nYou have two options. Invite your in-laws to the destination. Let them know that they want be attending the wedding or reception. They will be there, with your child, so that you and your husband can participate in your brother's wedding and associated events.

You offered to just be a guest he doesnt want that the groom is the one who offered to invite your inlaws or change the venue. Not wanting to leave a 3month old for multiple days is not unreasonable at all just like a child free wedding is not unreasonable.

He and I have always been close and he was the best man at our (much smaller) ceremony. At the time I committed to this obligation, no real planning had taken place so everyone was on standby waiting for further details and an official date.\n\nI'm not sure when they began properly planning things, but I didn't hear much more about it until November during our Thanksgiving family gathering. My brother's fianc\u00e9e told us the venue, the date, and the fact that the wedding was going to be child-free. Now, I have no issue with the concept of child-free weddings -- I had one myself. The problem is that my husband and I are expecting a baby. If all goes well with our surrogate's pregnancy (fingers crossed), our son will be 3 months old by the wedding date given. The venue they've chose is one 2.5 hours from where we live. We would likely be spending three days away from home.\n\nYou call me an overprotective first time parent, but the thought of both my husband and I being away from our child for that long when he's so little scares me, and he's not even here yet. My in-laws could watch him and I trust them completely, but I know I wouldn't be able to properly enjoy the festivities if my infant is over two hours away from me. I pulled my brother aside later in the night and apologized profusely while explaining my worries. He said he understood and offered up a venue change (one much closer to home) or maybe making an exception for me by inviting my in-laws to the wedding, that way I could see the baby during the ceremony and feel a little less stressed. I told him either would work for me and thanked him.\n\nHe spoke to his fianc\u00e9e, but she won't budge on either issue. He's vented to me multiple times over the course of the month that has now passed about how he's really frustrated because what matters most to him is making sure he's surrounded by the people he loves and that they are comfortable. Meanwhile his fianc\u00e9e continually repeats that she's not giving up her 'dream venue and ceremony.'  I told him my husband and I could just attend as guests instead if it would make things easier, but he immediately shut me down and said he wanted us by his side.\n\nShe texted me yesterday (politely, I'll admit) asking if I could please just drop things with my brother. I might have considered it previously, but hearing how she turned down all of my brother's requests for compromise made me put my foot down and refuse. I hate causing my brother trouble like this, especially so close to the holidays, but I feel like she's showing her true colors. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I would just say \"we can't wait to celebrate with you, but we just can't be in your wedding party\" and let the chips fall where they may. Before you say you can't do that, you can and I know because I did it.

I did however attend as a joyful guest.", "The best option for this is to go to the wedding and pay for your in-laws to come with you, treat it as a break for them and they take your son purely for the hours of the wedding.\n\nI've been a best man at a wedding with a toddler and it wasn't a child free wedding, just knew it would only be enjoyable for a finite period and therefore I'd not be able to enjoy myself.", "NAH - It feels to me like the issue is more that OPs brother and brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e have different things they want to prioritize for the wedding, and the fianc\u00e9e is blaming OP for that. Fianc\u00e9e and brother are definitely allowed to have the kind of wedding they want - it sounds like one of them wants her dream wedding and the other wants to be surrounded by happy and comfortable loved ones, and they aren\u2019t aligning on how to make both happen. OP offered to come as a guest instead of being in the wedding party so that he could have less responsibilities and be back to his baby more quickly, and they weren\u2019t accepting of that option. At this point, the bride and groom need to sort it out with each other and OP needs to do what\u2019s best for his spouse and family, and everyone involved needs to accept that the solution might not make everyone happy.", "YTA but so is brother.

Start exploring them and stop maligning your future SIL.\n\nYTA", "Then politely drop out of the wedding...", "NAH\n\nInvite your inlaws to the city where the wedding is being held. They can watch your newborn during the festivities, and you won't be away from them for more than a few hours. You wouldn't want a newborn at a wedding anyway, especially when you are part of the wedding party and need to focus on that. You couldn't manage it.", "NTA - you reasonably explained the situation to your brother. He offered a couple of different compromises (very generous of him), you were flexible and said either would work, as well as offering the alternative that you drop out of the bridal party so it\u2019s only a one-day event for you. Your brother obviously wants you there as a priority. The bride is welcome to her child-free perfect wedding, you\u2019re not disputing that. But the disagreement is actually between her and your brother, not you. Your brother prioritises your attendance as a member of the wedding party, the bride prioritises her location and child-free wedding. \n\nUltimately, you\u2019ve put your boundaries down and the fact that they can\u2019t agree isn\u2019t your problem. You can\u2019t just \u2018drop it\u2019 because you\u2019re still in an impossible situation. It\u2019s insane as a new parent to leave your child over 2 hours away for at least 3 days, even if it is with in-laws you trust. The couple need to decide whether they want you in the wedding party, or whether they want their dream location, or whether they want it to be totally child free. It\u2019s unfeasible to have all of those things.\n\nRealistically, I think you need to tell your future-SIL that you are already trying to be reasonable but you can\u2019t attend as a member of the wedding party given the circumstances, and you\u2019ve already offered to drop out but your brother refused. And, you need to speak to your brother and tell him that you don\u2019t want to cause fights but they need to work out what\u2019s best for the two of them because you\u2019ve tried to be flexible but if nothing can be decided, you need to drop out of the wedding party as you originally offered.\n\nIn this situation, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll end up needing to drop out, but this fight certainly isn\u2019t on you. All of the \u2018Y-T-A\u2019 votes here are harsh, they don\u2019t seem to recognise that you have offered to drop out, it\u2019s your brother that\u2019s creating a fight with his fianc\u00e9.", "NAH.\n\nThe Y T As are funny to me. \n\n\"Don't demand things\", OP isn't demanding anything except to know what they'd prefer he do.

The GROOM offered to change the venue.\n\n\"Just put the inlaws in a hotel\" like you're not already gonna be asking them to babysit for 3 days. Three days of babysitting a 3mo old is already a pretty big ask, are we just glossing over that they might not want to do that outside the comfort of their own home? Yes, ask, see if you can \"bribe\" them but people here are acting like there's no possible way they could have their own feelings on this. \n\nSounds like there's a breakdown in communication between the bride and groom and op just happens to be a conduit. She's refusing to compromise with the grooms wishes about THEIR wedding and he's not running big changes by her before just offering to do so(he tried to change the venue on her!). \n\nOP, ask your inlaws if they'd be interested in staying in a hotel to babysit. Tell your brother to just tell you what to do: leave the husband at home or step down to guest. There's no more other options without making you into the AH.", "Usually I\u2019d say Y T A but once I read the whole post I\u2019m going with NTA. OP voiced their worries and it was the groom who wanted to make accommodations (doesn\u2019t sound like OP requested that), and was willing to just attend (without the baby) as guests when fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t agree.

It's a lot to ask, but until you ask you won't know if they're okay with it (they may be fine since they'll be able to take care of their grandbaby). The only other option if your ILs don't want to come is your husband not be part of the wedding party and potentially not attend the wedding to take care of your infant either at the venue or home. One option costs you more money for another room and the other doesn't give you much time with your family.

That's where OP becomes TA.  When the bride approached him politely, OP should have tried to work with her to find a solution.  It's not OP's wedding, and OP should be willing to find a way to put the bride's preferences first in a way that works for his family.  \n\nI will say though, I do think OP knows who his brother is and \"expressed anxiety\" as a passive-aggressive way to see if he could get the brother to do exactly what he did.  I have never heard a member of the bridal party \"express anxiety\" about the venue.  The venue is what it is, and you either commit to making it work OR you say you may have to compromise for your family.

Either way, they made decisions together, they agreed on these things together. And now he's going back on them, that's a fucked up thing to do especially when there's so much money and stress involved in wedding planning. Like I said, if they move the venue they lose potentially thousands of dollars. If they make an expectation for the baby, they need to either deal with other pissed off family or invite all the kids.

Someone needs to have some flexibility here and I think OP is doing  the best he can but it\u2019s still a stressful situation on everyone involved.\n\nEdit: changed my mind about the bride being less of an AH out of all three", "I'm so confused... people have in-laws that are willing to be stuck in a hotel, in a city not of their choosing, with a baby that is going to be up every two hours?\n\nI wouldn't even do that if paid. \n\nIt's a huge favor to do that even with the comfort of their own home.", "This would be the most obvious and simple solution", "I\u2019m also confused why they\u2019d have to be there for 3 days? Even as a bridesmaid it was daily event. \n\nIf you\u2019re brother wants you there as a groomsman - agree but come day of. \n\nI concur with others here - 2.5hrs isn\u2019t a long drive for an event like this. (Heck I recently drove 2hrs for my son to have a play date) \n\nLeave at 0600-0700 or what-have-you, act as the groomsman, then leave after dinner or drinks. That\u2019s only one day baby needs sitting with the in-laws. \n\nIf brother insists the only way you can be a groomsmen is if you\u2019re there for all 3 days (no idea why or what you\u2019re doing in that time) - I\u2019d firmly say then you\u2019ll have to be a guest. \n\nAnd if the in-laws do agree to come - make it an overnight trip max and get them a nice hotel where they can babysit - no need for them to be at the ceremony.\n\nAnyone even entertaining the idea of switching venues is wild to me.\n\nI sort of think you & your brother are the AH\u2019s for making this needlessly complicated & stressing out the bride over such a weird non-issue. Also you\u2019re the AH for your attitude towards the bride who shouldn\u2019t be under any obligation to change her already planned dream wedding - which you act contemptuous of btw. \n\nSo ya YTA", "I don't have kids but asking your in-laws to watch a newborn for 3 days is already a big ask. 3 days in a hotel and away from their life, meds, bed, etc seems like a huge ask", "Right!?!?! Then OP painting the bride to be the bad guy because she doesn't want to change her wedding for them. If they have a date and a venue set, that means they paid deposits and most likely have the guest list set. I wouldn't want a 3 month old at my wedding (that i paid a ton of money for) screaming during the ceremony either. Believe me as a babysitter at MULTIPLE weddings, the babies AlWAYS cry at the worst moment.", "OP: A venue change would work for me, thanks!", "Brother should have said he didnt want the wedding 2.5 hours away BEFORE setting a date and venue. If they have that set, then they most likely put down deposits. The groom knew his brother/bestman was having a child, but he didn't think of that until OP said something. It honestly feels like brother is acting like he wants to change the venue to OP's face but really isn't and is throwing his bride under the bus.", "As someone who planned weddings. Changing the number of guests AND the venue is literally close to impossible 2 months away from the wedding without rehashing contracts etc. I would ask if the brother is planning the wedding to see if he even is aware of how crazy that is.", "The groom wants to change venue which is a HUGE change so I understand the bride being not down with changing the entire wedding to a new location potentially 1-2hrs away from the original location, for ONE person. This is asking way too much. I would say the groom is the asshole for even suggesting that they change their entire wedding venue to accommodate one person. Who offers changing the wedding venue without asking their fiancee first?\n\nIf she agrees, isn't this basically letting groom steamroll over what she wants? Why is it OK for groom to say that he wants to change the venue but it's not OK for her to say no she doesn't want to? The groom doesn't need to care about the bride's happiness at all? While she needs to accommodate his totally ridiculous request? Why does your comment seem to imply the fiancee do ALL the compromise and the groom gets everything he wants? That's not a compromise. \n\n\nGroom is also the person who refuses to let OP to be a normal guest, and insist that they must be in his wedding party. Seems to me groom is being totally unreasonable and unwilling to compromise on what he wants?\n\nA proper compromise is to pay for hotel and a babysitter if necessary, or to let OP be a regular guest and not in the wedding party. Changing the entire wedding to another location potentially 1-2hrs away, which also means every single vender have to be changed as well, asking fianc\u00e9e to be OK with redoing the whole entire wedding completely, is not a reasonable ask.", "The venue change idea is not realistic, and the fact that the groom offered it is IMO evidence that he is not at all involved with the planning (or that this post is fake).\n\nThere\u2019s already a venue and a date, which means there is a contract with said venue and a (likely non-refundable) deposit down on it already. Changing the venue at this point likely means eating a non-refundable deposit on the venue AND starting over from square one on everything else, possibly losing more money in the process since you\u2019d have to find all new vendors. \n\nDepending on the size of the family and who all is invited, going from child free to not can also be a huge added expense. It might also not even be realistic depending on the size of the venue and their guest list.", "People are voting that way, because there is a very easy solution here that doesn\u2019t even require brother or fianc\u00e9 to compromise with OP. OP brings his in-laws with him, gets them a hotel room, and they watch the baby at the hotel room. Treating it like these are the only solutions, to change the venue or to step down from the wedding party, is what makes him an asshole out of a couple people.\n\nEdit: Getting a lot of people bristling at me saying this is an easy solution. Response\u2014 look back at the post. When it was suggested the in-laws come to the wedding, OP said it would work. The in-law thing did not come out of thin air. They can apparently travel to babysit at the wedding but not to babysit at the hotel.", "Nonsense. Brother clearly had no problem with the venue until OP had a problem with the venue. The fiance has a right to be pissed that her partner is now backtracking to accommodate his brother's imaginary childcare problem. Can the venue even be changed at this point without losing a deposit?", "Bruh changing the ENTIRE VENUE is not a 'compromise' nor is it a small feat the brother should've ever suggested as an option before speaking with her. Much like having children at all, '1 child' is not a compromise. Your wedding either is or isn't child-free because the entire purpose is to avoid '1 child' screaming or crying or being disruptive at the event you paid thousands for. And if you want kids there, all the power to you. If you don't, letting a 3 month old in is going to get any other couples who were told 'absolutely no' irritated and so on and so forth.\n\nThere are solutions here but the bride not being willing to uproot her goals (whose family is paying for this wedding btw, is it OP's parents, hers, or the couple themselves) for her wedding for OP's first time parent self-absorption is not the problem.", "Okay but you people making this argument act like the couple didn't discuss and agree on these plans together before OP caused a fuss. It would be frustrating knowing that your wedding plans need to drastically be changed to make sure your groom's best man and brother don't back out. The groom clearly doesn't want to find a new best man and groomsman, so he wants to accommodate. But at the end of the day that is the groom choosing the wishes of his brother over the wishes of his bride on her/their (not OP's) wedding day. Also, there are options that don't involve changing the wedding plans at all if OP could suck it up for one day to make his brother and SIL happy and stress free on their big day. Also, even OP says she has been nothing but polite, but he is still mad that she won't change her wedding venue for him.\n\nETA: YTA", "My sister in law REFUSED every compromise for having care of her 1 year old for my wedding and basically threw an ultimatum about it. Claimed \u201che\u2019s a good boy and won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Not 30 seconds into the ceremony the baby starts crying and her husband took his sweet ass time getting the baby out of the ceremony.\n\nAnybody trying to insist on bringing their baby to a wedding when it\u2019s child free is a major AH, especially when there\u2019s realistic alternative childcare options.", "I\u2019ve never understood this concept of a \u201cperfect wedding.\u201d  They\u2019re never perfect.  Just like the concept of a \u201cperfect marriage.\u201d  Not reality.  I agree with your last sentence in your post.  The bride\u2019s desire to stick to the plan without giving a little bit for her husband does not bode well.", "I mean, whether or not the bride is being unreasonable doesn't change the fact that the wedding is still child-free. And being the bride is super stressful. What if she lets her FSIL bring her kid and now 10 other people start bitching about bringing theirs? Is the groom going to deal with all their drama?\n\nI have a much more difficult childcare situation than OP coming up with my brother's child-free wedding and I never asked them to reconsider letting me bring my newborn because their wedding isn't about what's easiest for me.\n\nOP has a perfectly acceptable solution in letting her dependable, reliable, responsible in-laws watch the kid for free for ONE night. She just doesn't want to do it.", "Yea I like how everyone is saying bride won't compromise, and by compromise they mean completely do what the op and husband want. \n\nYTA OP.", "The problem is they are part of the wedding party. This is why OP has offered to just attend as a guest, which would just be one day. But the groom doesn't want that.", ">Baby stays with inlaws overnight\n\nNot if he's in the party.  That means two nights, because he has to be there for the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner the night before - not to mention being there early enough to help brother prep on the wedding day even forgetting the rehearsal (although that entails less than the bride).", "A wedding is not about the venue, but changing the venue could mean losing hundreds to thousands of dollars on deposits. It\u2019s kind of ridiculous to ask someone to do that. Not only that, but if they make an exception for one couple to have their kids there will very likely be problems with the other parents that have paid babysitters", "I get that people choosing to go to a wedding shouldn\u2019t ask for special treatment. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here though, because he has to go. He got to have a childfree wedding, but I\u2019m guessing his brother didn\u2019t have a 3 month old child that he was expected to leave for 3 days. \n\nSo if you don\u2019t let your wedding guests bring their kids, then you\u2019re required to leave your baby for 3 days to be in your brothers wedding? I don\u2019t see the comparison. Who cares that other people couldn\u2019t bring their kids. Did his brother have to leave his newborn to go to OP\u2019s wedding? Why does the fact that other people (who got to choose whether to go) had to get a babysitter change OP\u2019s obligation to his brother?", "You didn\u2019t read the post. The OP is not demanding the wedding to change, rather he is offering to drop from the wedding party. It is the brother who is insistent. Next time read before commenting.", "OP offered to attend as guests, or not be at the wedding, or skip the party days and drive back the same day, but the groom wanted them there as a best man. How are so many people missing this point?", "You\u2019re an AH for saying OP is \u201cabandoning\u201d their baby.", "They should understand that OP can\u2019t join in on everything as a new parent. Just rehearsal, wedding, photos, reception. And it\u2019s ok to bow out early rather than stay to the end of the rehearsal and reception. Anything beyond that is unreasonable if they can\u2019t have their baby with them", "Pay for their accommodations and room service; find baby and grandparent fun activities. Let your brother know that you won't be able to attend all festivities that weekend BUT will be there for your best man duties. \n\nAlso this of this as their first vacation with baby; less stress since you could be in an adjoining room but they still get fun grandparent time.", "Maybe you can pay for some fun activities for them when they don\u2019t have the baby.  (and you should only ask for babysitting that\u2019s necessary.) Also if they dislike driving maybe you can drive them as well?", "We did something similar. We paid for a baby sitter for anyone with small children for the actual ceremony and the reception. We hired 3 babysitters. Other than those 5 hours, children everywhere.", "I completely agree! \n\nAn important missing piece of the puzzle is ...how much is brother helping with the planning? Because it sounds like he asked two expectant parents to be in his groomsmen and didn't think about what that meant for other wedding decisions and also did not ask them what they may need until AFTER a bunch of decisions were made. Instead he is asking to back track on a bunch of decisions after he asked them  to be groomsmen and then failed to communicate for months...", "I think brother suggested in laws come to the wedding? I\u2019m not sure", "None of these things except for the wedding and reception should be all day affairs.\n\nHow long can a wedding rehearsal be?

And spread out a bit?", "But they can\u2019t bring the baby to the wedding so how could they go?", "Uh you know why people typically don\u2019t want infants at quiet ceremonies right?", "Idk man some babies tend to scream and cry..A LOT. For me baby crying is 10x worse than nails on a chalk board. A wedding doesn't seem like an appropriate place for an infant.", "Usually those in the wedding party have to be there for the rehearsal dinner which is the night before, and there\u2019s usually a brunch with the wedding party the day after the wedding.

I don\u2019t think op should necessarily ask the in laws to be in the hotel either, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll be in a crappy, dangerous motel with no food or water or means of leaving the room lol.", "Well, considering OP says that the baby will be about 3 months old at the time of the wedding and it sounds the surrogate is still pregnant as of now, the wedding is at least 3 months away if not more. Which, I agree, is still crazy short notice. Frankly though, if you know both parents of a theoretically 3 month old are going to be in your wedding party, you should take that into consideration when planning, and if you don't consider it, then you need to have made that decision before asking your party members so they can make an informed decision not to take on a role they can't accommodate.", "I agree he should never have made that suggestion without talking to his fiancee first. He should have said, \"Let me talk to fiancee about what compromises we can make and get back to you.\" But if he made the suggestion to her privately first and she didn't want to compromise on that or anything else, they would likely still be in this situation. Yes, he put the cart before the horse, but the cart is full of shit regardless.\n\nBoth the bride and groom asked OP and husband to be part of the wedding party before revealing it was going to be childfree. It sounds like they probably knew OP would have an infant at the time of the wedding before the announced the rule, as well. So when they revealed the rule, OP explained that this new rule would impact him negatively, which he could not have known when he was first asked. Presumably, bro did not consider this when he and fiancee agreed to venue and child-free rule, which is likely why he offered the compromises that his wife did not like. The only compromise OP offered was to step down. Bro doesn't want that because his wedding party is important to him. Why is bro's dream wedding party less important than fiancee's dream wedding venue?", "It depends how far out the wedding is, and what all the venue includes as to how much money they stand to lose. It also is important who is paying for the wedding. If it's just the bride or her family, then sure she has the final say. But if the couple are sharing the cost, then I presume she's already explained that cancelling will incur a fee, and if he's still adamant, then it's *that* important to him and should be taken into consideration. If she hasn't told him that losing the deposit is why she won't compromise and she \"just won't do it because it's \\[her\\] dream venue,\" then she's a bad communicator and/or petulant.", "Maybe you're fortunate enough to have in-laws that can just take off 3 days and travel, and be the main care providers for an infant, but not everyone does.

That's a lot of assumptions to make.", "I wouldn\u2019t ask my parents much less my in-laws to make a 3 day trip just to babysit for me.  They\u2019re not on demand babysitters, even if they\u2019re retired, they have their own lives and schedules.  \n\nNAH for the OP, but all the people acting like it\u2019s such a simple solution to drag the in-laws along as babysitters are huge assholes", "That's frankly a huge ask, not only of the in-laws to make the trip, but of OP to foot the bill of another hotel room or a suite for 3 days. It is a possible solution, and it sounds like OP is going to try it. However, OP even said that the in-laws are already doing a huge favor to watch an infant for 3 days, nevermind asking them to make a trip for a wedding they're not invited to in order to spend a lot of their time in a hotel with said infant.", ">a very easy solution\n\nI'm happy for all those commenters who have 1. the money to pay for an extra suit for 3 days (after all they paid to attend the wedding already), 2. have the in-laws who have the time, energy and are willing to do this kind of favor, and 3. think it's an easy solution. Honestly, if you have all that in your life, I'm happy for you and hope you're grateful for it.\n\nEven if OP and his husband will be present some of the time, and even if they're not exactly confined indoors, it's still a huge ask. I understand why this was not OP's first thought. In my mind, it's a last resort kinda favor. \n\nAnd FYI, OP and his husband did not propose to change the venue or to bring their baby.

It's baffling how many people don't seem to understand this.", "I sure don\u2019t have enough $ lying around to pay for two people\u2019s flights and hotel accommodations.

Typically when people have child free weddings themselves, you assume that you don\u2019t need to inform someone of this rule because they themselves implemented it at their own wedding. Further, we don\u2019t know when they started planning this wedding. OP could\u2019ve been asked to stand in the wedding well before the baby was on the way. Babies only take nine months to make. If you\u2019re having a larger wedding in a popular area and you have a specific venue that you want, your planning starts a year or more out.

That seems incredibly unrealistic, and sounds like the groom talking out his ass. They'd lose deposits, and need research all new vendors because most probably won't travel 2.5 hours.", "She's not necessarily. She's refusing to make a HUGE change to their wedding for one person. Which is actually really reasonable.", "Depends how involved the groom is in planning IMO, if he is putting in the same emotional labor as the bride to plan everything and think of everyone (which frankly imo he is not since he asked his groomsmen who are expecting a child and then went MIA for months) then yes it is his wedding too. \n\nBut all too frequently brides do an immense amount of decision making and planning then asking them to back track and replan around a groomsman after not communicating with them what they needed to participate - then the SIL is a bit justified in being frustrated", "They can be in the wedding  and not at every single  thing, that's  what compromise  means.", "There are multiple events. They wouldn't be all day babysitting, but it is a lot to ask and it will be all-day on the wedding day or close to it, I'm sure. \n\nHowever, they can sweeten the pot w/ setting up a spa treatment when OP and hubby will not be busy w/ the wedding and scheduling other things to make the trip more vacation-y for the in-laws where possible.", "Not to mention they tried to be guests so it would be easier for them and thats perfectly acceptable to just be a guest at a wedding over in the party if needed and ops brother wouldn\u2019t let them both be guests", "Imagine that they could (if they have those in where they are), if money would not be an issue. But it would still requiring them to be \"trapped\" for 3 days with a 3 month baby outside of their house and, expectedly, without the ammenities of their own home.\n\nIt that really a suitable alternative to just invite them to the wedding, when even the groom wants it?", "The brother Said that inviting the inlaws was for OP to be able to see the baby.

Changing it might mean other people cannot come. \n\nWe don't have the full picture here so I can't judge on whether fiancee is an asshole for refusing. \n\nObjectively, it is much easier to have OP&partner come as a regular guest, or to ask someone to come babysit in a hotel nearby, instead of moving a whole wedding or making exceptions for having a baby at a child-free wedding (other guests with kids may get upset or the baby cries which is the whole point of not having kids at a wedding to begin with).\n\nGroom went full nuclear on the compromise (changing the whole wedding to get his wedding party) instead of finding more reasonable solutions, so IMO the groom is the biggest \"non-compromise\" that's happening here.", ">bro did not consider this when he and fiancee agreed to venue and child-free rule,\n\nBut this was his responsibility too. He can't backtrack on something like this. Most people who want a child free wedding want it **absolutely** child free.

They agreed on one things and now he is trying to change the agreement and the choices they made.\n\nAlso, it's 2.5h away, OP can ask in laws to be at the hotel or say to the bride and groom they will leave early and go home right after.

It\u2019s a different scenario if he already ran down that option fully And it was a no-go. Rather, it seems like it\u2019s a possibility, because he was asking for his in-laws to be invited so that they could watch the child at the wedding. Why is it a big difference to have them watch the child at the hotel instead other than the additional cost of another hotel room?", "And for 3 days at that\u2026 like this isn\u2019t just a one night event, where yes ask your in laws but 3 days???", "Why is it on all or nothing? Why can\u2019t the in-laws just come out for the wedding and OP and his husband alternate being at certain events? And is it just the wedding the child free or is everything child free?

So the in-laws can suddenly not travel anymore if they can\u2019t come and eat cake? People aren\u2019t pulling the suggestion out of thin air. OP specifically makes it sound like it\u2019s a possible alternative.", "I point you back to the OP, where he specifically says when his brother suggested the in-laws get invited to the wedding and come that that would be something that would work for him. Are the in-laws now no longer able to travel if they cannot come to the wedding, but must instead babysit a child at a hotel room? People are not pulling the suggestion out of thin air, OP makes it sound like it\u2019s a possibility.\n\nThree month olds also cry, in addition to eating, sleeping, and pooping. I\u2019ve been to multiple weddings where a child shrieked all through the vows, and the parents refused to take them out. That\u2019s one reason why the bride probably doesn\u2019t want the child there. The second reason, and I know everyone is going to attack this bride for being a drama queen, and wanting to be self-centered, but when you\u2019re spending the amount of money you spend on your wedding day, you kind of want to be the VIP. Chances are, this being a three month old, this event will be the first time that the family is meeting the baby. That baby will be the focus of the wedding for the groom\u2019s family. Not the people getting married.", "Y'all really be thinking something that's not about the OP is about the OP. The wedding does not need to change venues for ONE person because that person is gonna be \"stressed\" that's a seriously dumb compromise the brother even offered to begin with. The OP is an AH for not budging about the so called compromise. The bride shouldn't even have to entertain that. The OP needs to manage his own shit which includes his own stress about seeing his child. It is not up to the bride or groom to manage that for him.", "And she's well within her rights to do so. Whether the groom asked or not the reasons for asking aren't valid. OP needs to tell bro what she's doing vs the back and forth. Brother is the biggest AH here but bride isn't at all and OP for even bring it up after being told it's child free is. If it's child free it's child free why does everyone think they're the exception to the rule?", "The thing that gets me is the bride isn\u2019t taking her groom\u2019s feelings into consideration at all. It\u2019s his wedding too and OP has offered some decent compromises.  I hate it when weddings become one persons dream and the other persons dream (like having his brother and his BIL stand up for him) just get ignored. She could have made a couple of small exceptions for her future husbands brother who has a very legitimate concern/special situation.", "Honestly, I feel like people who have this attitude that the bride is being ridiculous have never planned any kind of large-scale expensive event before. Even if they wanted to change venues, it\u2019s a logistical nightmare. The wedding is 2 1/2 hours away. First, can you even find a venue closer? That is something that you like, or because you were looking out so soon before the date you have to be satisfied with whatever drugs are left? Especially if you\u2019re getting married during a popular time of the year to get married.  You move the wedding to be somewhere closer, well now you have to find a new band if you have a band. Now you have to find new caterers if they won\u2019t drive out that far. If you\u2019re going to keep your original vendors, you may have expensive additional travel costs on top of it to now accommodate this new venue. Chances are some of those decorations that you bought because they would look so great in one part of your venue, now have to be scrapped because there\u2019s nowhere to use them in the new venue. What are the colors like in the place? What about the centerpieces that are already being shipped and on the way? Did the dress you buy looked fantastic in your original venue, but now looks out of place in the new one? These are all things that, frankly, grooms and other people who are completely checked out of the wedding planning process don\u2019t think about.\n\nAs for the childfree wedding\u2014 If you make an exception for one kid, word always gets around. Then people start asking about bringing their kids, or some people flat out ignore the rule entirely because they know someone else is bringing a kid, and now you have a dozen children there. Unfortunately, those are things I just have to be enforced across the board.", "It\u2019s the combination of child-free + having to stay out of town for 3 days that makes this unrealistic for OP. If the venue was nearby there would be no problem, so OP couldn\u2019t have been expected to know", "It\u2019s like half of the people commenting read the whole thing and the other half have some kind of wedding PTSD built up.", "Maybe having his brother as his best man IS that much more important to him.

If you\u2019re gonna have a child free wedding, accept that some people won\u2019t be able to attend.

Every single thing you said calling the groom selfish could be said about the bride too.", "Yes, because that is what the OP wrote.", "I think OP knows that. I mean, he even suggested not being part of the wedding party, but brother insisted.", "It OP is in the wedding he has to be there for the rehearsal, the rehearsal dinner, the day of the wedding (before the ceremony pictures, the ceremony, pictures after, the reception).

Can some **please** explain to me why as a groomsmen he\u2019d have to be there 3 days and not just the one??? It\u2019s not a destination wedding. Even if it\u2019s a cultural thing - the reasonable compromise is he just goes day-of. Why is this so friggin complicated???", "That wasn't it....OP offered to step down and attend as guests so he and his husband can take care of baby themselves and pop in and out but his brother wants him there as best man (and husband as groomsman). He basically isn't given much of a choice despite giving other suggestions that don't involve a venue shift (which was his brother's idea in the first place too)", "So, you haven't read it. Cool cool.", "You hit the nail on the head.\n\nAlso seems pretty obvious that not many of the people here have ever been involved in planning a wedding. Simply \"changing the venue\" is nowhere near as easy as everyone seems to think.", "Well don't expect people with newborns to come then. Which is fine for a peripheral friend, but close family you either have to accommodate or dissinvite them.

He realized the timing and the fact it's a child-free wedding would mean leaving their baby behind for 3 days and is not comfortable committing to that. The groom is the one proposing all those changes because it's important to him to have his brother there. OP proposed to back out and only come as guests, so they'll only be there on the day of the wedding, but the brother is refusing that. If they aren't able to organize child care for their baby for 3 days where the wedding takes place what else can they do? I don't think demanding they just suck it is very fair either.\n\nPeople here are acting like OP and his husband are making demands left and right. They just communicated what is possible for them under those new circumstances. Not their fault the groom is pushing for them to be there and wants the bride to make changes she's unhappy with.", "I agree. It's not. It's wrong to ask OP to leave a new baby, and he's offered other solutions. I think he's right: the bride is showing her true colors. \n\nEdited to add: But he needs to tell his brother and sister-in-law-to-be (maybe at a time when they are together) that he is not going to leave his new baby at home when he travels two hours away.

There are sometimes in life when people offer you things, and you can blatantly tell they are either speaking out of turn or offering some thing that is just unrealistic, and should be turned down because it is way too big of an ask. A suggestion to change the venue should\u2019ve been an immediate no from OP I hear peoples comments about three days in a hotel being a lot to ask if somebody, it is. But we keep treating. This is an all or nothing situation. Are all of the events of the wedding childfree? Could the child come to informal events like the rehearsal dinner, or an arrival dinner if there\u2019s one of those? If not, can OP go to one, and his husband go to the other to trade off? That way the in-laws would only have to come for one day, the wedding. I feel like there are a lot of other solutions that were not fully explored here that should have been before the requests for accommodation came.\n\nAs for OP\u2018s comment about feeling awkward about asking his in-laws to come and watch the baby, I frankly could not care less.

It sucks, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s an invitation to stand in a wedding party, it\u2019s not a subpoena or compel performance. I think op should change his tone, and start looking for ways to get his brother to compromise rather than continuing to push for accommodation.", "So the brother should get his way because one person, albeit a very close person, has an issue? Nah fam, the OP needs to get his shit together and the brother needs to get his head out of his ass. I'm sure the bride thought about and as most of the YTA'ers here thought about it, it was dumb and shouldn't be entertained and the brother needs to drop it.", "You miss the point. It's not to make someone else happy. It's to make the groom happy. It's his best man and groomsman that he wants to be there an be a part of the wedding who don't feel comfortable.

Bride said it was her dream venue why is that not being respected? Groom doesn't want the change for him he wants it for a sibling and it isn't due to a disability or reason they aren't being accommodated there. It's because the sibling doesn't want to be away from baby.

The in laws have likely already been to the same city that the venue is in lol and I agree with the other commenter they can go to the park, a zoo, an aquarium, etc.", "I mean he didn't ask him to ask his brother.  This is aita for this reason.  For holding his ground that he would not just leave his child.  He is fine with being a guest.  That is a solution.  The venue is clearly not as important to the groom as it is the bride.  While outlandish to some, I'd personally assume if it was being offered to me that it wasn't a big deal.  My venue was booked 3 months before our wedding.  Again I recognize not all situations would be that easy.  That's not what is asked.  For this situation OP is not the AH.  They're not demanding anything, they're just letting their boundaries be clear and trying to find a way to make it work within the boundaries also being made by the bride/groom.  The issue is communication between the couple getting married and where their priorities are in comparison to each other.  That is not OPs problem.  Becoming a guest is a perfect solution but bro won't budge.  It solves everything!  OP should not have to work this out for them.  \n\nI understand completely what you're saying and I see your point. If OP was doing as his brother was I'd call him an AH no problem, but he isn't.  He's not marrying the bride and does not need to bend over backwards to make her dream wedding come true.", "Brother wants not to have to sacrifice the *people* in his wedding party on his special day for a *place*. Brother wants his future wife to consider that, and she is not having any of it. They're both very stubborn, but it's not up to OP to convince his brother to give up his stubbornness for hers. They need to hash out the problem between them that OP did not create. That's what married people have to do.", "Yeah, invite the in-laws up is the best solution.

His brother mentioned it as a possibility (which was extremely silly). \nOP isn\u2019t pressuring anyone to do anything. He has simply told his brother that he may not be able to be in the wedding party given the circumstances of having a newborn.

One of my sister\u2019s had a monitor that went off if the baby stopped breathing.", "OP's brother is the one who wont accept them just being guests though. For all we know the bride is fine with that solution.", "Completely agree! Honestly seems kind of dense of the groom to ask them both to be in the wedding a) knowing his brother was expecting and b) knowing his wedding would be child free without having a conversation with his brother and BIL during the planning phase of what might work for everyone. There is someone who seems to be a poor communicator here and IMO it is not OP or SIL", "Unreasonable people will act unreasonably. It doesn\u2019t make sense to cater to that though.", "Well venue was already decided. So I would say it\u2019s the Groom being inconsiderate to the Bride in this instance. He didn\u2019t even discuss with her before telling his brother it would be changed. He only discussed with her after and is now vocalising his displeasure with her refusal to his brother. I would say the only AH here is Groom. Bride and OP are NTA for me.", "And that's his prerogative. He's the groom. He gets to tell the bride \"No, my best man is non-negotiable, pick one of the solutions that make it possible for him to be there with me.\"", "Then OPs brother should have maybe communicated better with his groomsmen before they had things planned out. \n\nSounds like it was radio silence from him for months and he gave 0 thought to asking both his brother and BIL to be groomsmen knowing they were expecting. If my MOH was expecting you know i would have talked with them about date, location, childcare etc. when I asked! Now he is trying to change things once a date and location are picked because he didn't communicate with the people he was asking a huge favor from (being in the wedding is a favor)", "NTA. Your FSIL sounds like someone who calls it \"MY wedding, MY reception, etc.\" You offered solutions and she's digging in her heels because she wants \"HER\" day to be perfect. Sounds to me like a taste of things to come.", "NTA. Being away from your baby at just three months as a new parent for multiple days is a HUGE deal. That\u2019s when the fourth trimester is ending. There\u2019s still night feedings and people get exhausted. People don\u2019t realize how much goes into it. Honestly you\u2019re just being a decent parent to your new baby before they arrive.", "NAH.\n\nYou need to encourage your bro to have aome serious convos about balance, compromise, and future marital/child-rearing challenges, to see if he will be allowed any input in this future marriage as he doesnt seem to have any input into the wedding, which wont happen without him.   \n\nBetter find out now if he is headed for divorce before he walks down the aisle - mine cost me $40k plus alimony!!  Cheaper to lose wedding venue deposits and walk away....", "A venue change this late is absolutely not a valid compromise - that\u2019s super last minute when they\u2019re usually booked out for months in advance. They\u2019ll lose deposit fees, and likely have to pick new vendors for the wedding - that\u2019s losing deposits and getting new people for catering, wedding cakes, photography, furniture and decor, etc. A lot of those things are also super far booked out, and they\u2019ll lose deposits on it, which can be a hefty chunk of change. Especially the food places, since those won\u2019t usually go 2+ hours out for that kind of thing. It\u2019s a huge money sink even if they\u2019d be able to do it.\n\nAnd having a baby there during the ceremony isn\u2019t a compromise either because at that stage, they\u2019re loud and need constant care. The entire point of a child free wedding is quiet + adult party festivities, and having a newborn *during* the ceremony is not going to be quiet.", "This is the best solution. I went to a childfree wedding several hours away when my son was about 4 months old and I brought my mom along to stay with him nearby and was able to pop in and see him between the ceremony and reception, and I left the reception shortly after the dinner and speeches. Granted I wasn't in the wedding party which does make it trickier, but I was nursing, which involved some juggling too. Not ideal all around, but a workable solution for sure.", "This seems like an incredibly obvious solution. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This is what I was thinking too. Invite the inlaws to help while they're at the wedding. It might be a little more expensive, as I assume OP would pay for the in-laws' room at the hotel, but they get to attend the wedding and be part of it and not be away from the baby for so long. \n\nI also think it's a little concerning the bride to be won't compromise, especially with the future groom, given it's also his wedding. But I can also only imagine how stressful wedding planning can be, and depending on how close it is to the wedding, it could potentially be either too late to find another venue or they may have to forego their deposit on the OG venue etc. Not to mention catering etc bc I can't imagine, if it's catered, not by the venue, the caterer will want to travel, not to mention the band/DJ, celebrant etc. \n\nOP's concerns ofc are valid. But I think inviting the in-laws is the best option here. And also, I feel like staying 3 days for a 2.5hr travel is a little overkill, but idk where OP is from and this could be a lot further to some people as it is for me. I've done day trips to places for events 3+hrs 1 way but here (Australia) that's not terribly far. At least for me", "This is the easiest solution.

OP is absolutely YTA.", "It also sounds like brother has been a nonparticipant in the planning and failed to communicate with his groomsmen until decisions were made.

He has people he considers to be \u201ccompletely trustworthy\u201d available to watch his kid - if he\u2019s THAT paranoid, put those in-laws up in a nearby hotel with the kid instead of making these absurd demands.

There are some very simply solutions here and they both seem to be making it far more complicated than it needs to be - both of them for different reasons.\n\nOP is also acting like the fiancee is a villain for not wanting to rearrange her plans, potentially losing money on the venue if it is already booked (which I'm sure it is if the wedding is less than 9 months away), and possibly having to change the date because of a change in venue. The groom's venue compromise sounds like utter BS, and I suspect he isn't deeply involved in the wedding planning itself.", "Did we read the same thing? OP did not ask for them to change venues, the GROOM offered that. So that was not an accommodation OP even asked for yet you\u2019re assigning that to him.

Asking that many people to rebook?)

Depending on where they live and how big it\u2019ll be, he might not find one though. \n\nIf he did not offer to comp her for the extra costs and expected her to cough it up, I would say he\u2019s the AH.

When you are suggesting moving the venue, you\u2019re basically suggesting canceling the wedding. Because now you have to find a venue that is available that\u2019s closer if you\u2019re six months out in a decently populated area, you have very few options about where you can have the wedding you want because most places are already booked up. So you\u2019re probably going to lose your date if you want to get a venue that you actually like. Have you already ordered your invitations? That sucks, gotta throw them out and get some new ones reprinted with the new date and venue.  How about your vendors? Now all your vendors have to travel 2 1/2 hours. Will they even travel or do you have to find new ones? And if they do travel, what are the travel expenses going to be? A lot of vendors will agree to travel as long as you\u2019re paying an hourly rate for that travel time and reimbursing them for all the travel costs. By now you have also paid deposits on the venue, and you\u2019re probably gonna lose your deposits if you change it, which can be significant chunk of change. Losing that money may mean that you don\u2019t have the money to get as nice of a venue at the new place.\n\nI know a lot of people are acting like it was a reasonable thing to explore because brother suggested it, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m out of line for thinking that brother probably has had little to no involvement with the planning of this wedding. His bride and her family have probably done most if not all of it. So he doesn\u2019t understand that the idea of suggesting to change the venue is so unbelievably out of touch.

Both his sibling and his brother in law will be part of the wedding party. We announced the details of the wedding at Thanksgiving, including the venue, which is 2.5 hours away from home, and the fact that it's child free.\n\nThe problem is his sibling and their husband are expecting a baby who will be about 3 months old by the time we get married. Without discussing anything with me, my fiance told his sibling that we would either change the venue or allow them to invite their in laws, who they would have watching the baby. It's not that they don't trust their in laws, just that they're nervous to be so far from their baby. \n\nI put my foot down. I want this venue, and it's not fair to ask me to change such an important aspect of my wedding to accommodate them when they have a viable option. As for inviting their in-laws, that still means having a baby at my wedding, which will not only be disruptive but will also upset other guests who made arrangements for their children. If I make an exception for them, I'll have to make an exception for every parent. \n\nObviously, this is upsetting my fiance as he wants to give in to his sibling, but I need him to support the vision we agreed on, which I set my heart on, for our wedding. Instead of putting him in the middle, I reached out to his sibling directly, asking politely that they stop putting him in this position. They refused and doubled down. Now I just don't know what to do. \n\nYou see how that sounds? How about getting your in-laws a hotel room and treating them to a weekend getaway? They can be out and about with their grandbaby, and you can be at the wedding, and maybe they can have some time to do their own thing the following day before you all head home.", "YTA! You readily admit that you had a childfree wedding and were able to enjoy it and while you said it was small, you said it would was exactly how you wanted your own wedding. While the wedding is between two people and most couples plan together it has always been more so the bride's day if for no other reason than tradition (although often paid for by the couple themselves now) it was traditionally the bride's family that covered the wedding.\n\n\nNow they included you right from the beginning with the planning in as much as saying hey we want you and your husband to stand up for us in the bridal party and we're getting married at whatever dream location they picked & you were even happy by your own words when they said they too like you and your husband were planning a childfree wedding.\n\n Everybody was on board for this wedding fast track however many months since this original discussion took place and I'm assuming that the wedding is now fast approaching as you said it was again discussed during your family Thanksgiving. During this celebration your brother & is fiance/rest of the family were discussing how exciting it was while it was getting closer in terms of having it at their dream location etc etc. \n\nThen you go and throw a bucket of ice cold water on their excitement and state that now \"you're having a baby\" they obviously must change their childfree wedding plans to accommodate your child, and yes I know it's hard to a) separate yourself from a child especially what is essentially going to be a long weekend by the sound of it due to location and b) it's always scary to parents new and/or only child parents to leave them with a babysitter especially if it would be the first such event.\n\nNow your brother gave you options according to you i.e. have your in laws babysit and they can be invited to the wedding or the reception so that there are no distractions during the wedding and everyone can let go rather than be wondering where kids are underfoot when there are going to a lot of adults not to mention drinking (most weddings) and most people would organise a babysitter so they can have a night or two off even if they bring said babysitter with them.\n\nYou stated that it wasn't a good enough compromise and because he desperately wants all his family there on the day he marries the love of his life & to also have you stand with them while they get married. So because it was/is and understandably important that you (his sister & BIL) be there for what is going to be one of the most important days of his life, he without discussing with his fiance first blurts out how about we move the wedding to this other location closer to home so that way you can come to the wedding and reception and then go to your inlaws and collect your child before going home.\n\nHe then went to his fiance and asked which really he probably should have first but he was desperate to have all his family there & childfree means exactly that not make an exception for your niece or nephew because you now have a child you can't be separated from at all. When his fiance said the current venue is her dream location and dream childfree wedding. You put your foot down and make it all about you with your demands that nothing that your brother tried to compromise with was good enough and your wishes come above his and his fiance's wishes. \n\nDon't make this your hill to die on because more than likely it'll end with you no longer having a brother because he will go no/low contact and any relationship you have currently or hope to have in the future with your SIL will be ruined all because a grown woman who had her dream wedding wants to spoil someone else's dream wedding for her own benefit.", "The groom is an AH for suggesting the venue change when the obvious response is to get your in laws to watch the kid closer to the venue.

How is that fair to him?", "NAH. I think there is a far better compromise here. Bring your child care provider(s) with you. They do not have to be at the wedding as guests, but are close by so that you can be near your baby.  Pay for the hotel accommodations and Treat whoever your bringing with to some free time and their entertainment during that three day stay.

His fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t exactly an AH either. She\u2019s the bride. Your brother is the groom. They have every right to choose the venue and children free policy. It may be inconvenient for you, but it\u2019s not their responsibility to accommodate your child. I don\u2019t think her \u201ctrue colors\u201d are showing because she\u2019s not wrong.

You should solve this on your own.

It's getting the wedding parties dressed/makeup, photos can take over an hour, then the ceremony can take up to an hour if you have a service with it. You then might have more photos and potentially just some down time for a bit. After that is the reception. I don't know how many you've been to, but most receptions I've been to have started at about 2pm and gone until at least 11pm, sometimes with an after-party.\n\nThe following day is also typically a brunch for the family of the bride and groom as well as the wedding party.

There might be more to that and the groom might not know how much planning the bride has done.", "All the bride shaming is ridiculous. It's inconsiderate to expect for this woman to change venues and who knows how many other things for one person. The groom should've checked with her first before offering things that he clearly had no knowledge of as it sounds like she doing most of the planning. There's deposits, vendors,  catering to be considered but because OP,  who had a CHILD FREE wedding himself, everything needs to change? Cut the woman some slack.", "That\u2019s why I actually think brother is the biggest ah for not letting OP and his husband step down from the wedding party.", "Have you seen Airbnb prices these days?", "They agreed before they had a date or venue. Once they were told the date and venue, they mentioned that this isn't going to work for them.

I may be biased because my SIL tried to dictate our wedding venue and was relentless, with support / no push back from my husband\u2019s immediate and extended family. It was unbelievably stressful and I had a moment where I reached out politely asking her to please stop and accept that we would be making the decisions. She refused to back down so I said she would be missed. My husband and I were in complete agreement though, so there weren\u2019t mixed signals like in OP\u2019s case. \n\nAs a parent of two, I think the best case scenario would be if OP\u2019s in laws  could join them at the hotel and watch the baby during the photos and ceremony. Then they could hopefully take time to check in, see the baby, then have a little fun at reception. May be unrealistic but sounds more of a compromise than adding more people to the guest list and forcing the baby issue.", "I think people calling the bride an AH are ignoring the in laws compromise round still have a 3 month newborn in the wedding, even with OP and their spouse not looking after it.

It\u2019s like change venues or invite the in laws and allow a crying baby. Those are not compromises.", "He did not say he needed to bring the baby so no showing off, he suggested not being the groomsmen so they could just attend as guests which makes your responsibilities go away during the whole weekend so that they wouldn\u2019t be gone AWAY from the baby as long.", "Meanwhile, everyone is going after the bride for being 'unreasonable'", "Though we also can't know that for sure as finances were never brought up, only that she didn't want to change venues from her dream choice. I agree that a venue change would be a bit extreme and there is definitely information missing, likely because the OP is not privy to the behind the scenes details. And paying for the parents was never mentioned, in fact the OP states in a comment somewhere that he would be paying for the hotel accommodations if he could get them on board. I believe the groom's suggestion of inviting the in-laws was done so the brother would have a better chance of convincing them to also go out of town to babysit. I think the brother's suggestion of a venue change, while likely impractical and unnecessary, shows just how important it is to him to have his brother in the wedding party. I would think then that there would be some willingness on her part then to compromise so that the wedding is their dream ceremony, not just hers.", "I agreed in my other comment that venue is impractical, but it wasn\u2019t the only option posed by the groom and clearly expresses how important it is to him to try and keep his brother in the wedding party.

The groom did.\n\nHe basically said to the groom that he wouldn't be comfortable leaving his 2 month old infant behind and groom came up with these \"compromises\" because he wants those closest to him there.

He's saying \"Well I won't be able to come.\" Groom is saying \"Well I'll make sure we can make it so you can come because I want/need you here!\" and then the Bride is saying \"You need to come to the wedding and forget about any logistical problems this might cause for you because Groom is telling me to do all these things that I can't or don't want to do for the wedding\"\n\nLike, what exactly is the solution here that the groom gets his brother to be his Best Man, Bride gets her wedding in the venue (which isn't going to change regardless of anything because that's an insane thought) with no children and OP/husband get to bring their newborn along?\n\nThe only possible way is if the in laws come with them, which is a really tough thing to ask of anyone. \"Hey, want to come with us for 3 days to this wedding. But you can't GO to the wedding, you have to babysit a newborn in the hotel. For 3 days.\" I don't know about you, but I know exactly zero people in my life that can just run off to a hotel for 3 days to babysit.
