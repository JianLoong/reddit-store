{"id": 5463, "submission_id": "ztqi5f", "title": "AITA for asking my brother to accommodate my son at his child-free wedding and refusing to drop it?", "selftext": "A few months ago, my older brother asked me to be his best man and my husband to be a groomsman. He and I have always been close and he was the best man at our (much smaller) ceremony. At the time I committed to this obligation, no real planning had taken place so everyone was on standby waiting for further details and an official date.\n\nI'm not sure when they began properly planning things, but I didn't hear much more about it until November during our Thanksgiving family gathering. My brother's fianc\u00e9e told us the venue, the date, and the fact that the wedding was going to be child-free. Now, I have no issue with the concept of child-free weddings -- I had one myself. The problem is that my husband and I are expecting a baby. If all goes well with our surrogate's pregnancy (fingers crossed), our son will be 3 months old by the wedding date given. The venue they've chose is one 2.5 hours from where we live. We would likely be spending three days away from home.\n\nYou can call me an overprotective first time parent, but the thought of both my husband and I being away from our child for that long when he's so little scares me, and he's not even here yet. My in-laws could watch him and I trust them completely, but I know I wouldn't be able to properly enjoy the festivities if my infant is over two hours away from me. I pulled my brother aside later in the night and apologized profusely while explaining my worries. He said he understood and offered up a venue change (one much closer to home) or maybe making an exception for me by inviting my in-laws to the wedding, that way I could see the baby during the ceremony and feel a little less stressed. I told him either would work for me and thanked him.\n\nHe spoke to his fianc\u00e9e, but she won't budge on either issue. He's vented to me multiple times over the course of the month that has now passed about how he's really frustrated because what matters most to him is making sure he's surrounded by the people he loves and that they are comfortable. Meanwhile his fianc\u00e9e continually repeats that she's not giving up her 'dream venue and ceremony.'  I told him my husband and I could just attend as guests instead if it would make things easier, but he immediately shut me down and said he wanted us by his side.\n\nShe texted me yesterday (politely, I'll admit) asking if I could please just drop things with my brother. I might have considered it previously, but hearing how she turned down all of my brother's requests for compromise made me put my foot down and refuse. I hate causing my brother trouble like this, especially so close to the holidays, but I feel like she's showing her true colors. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - If I was a guest, I would not have brought this up at all. Both my husband and I being *in the wedding party* is what complicates things. As I said, I\u2019m all for child-free weddings.", "created_utc": 1671823895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztqi5f/aita_for_asking_my_brother_to_accommodate_my_son/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bring your inlaws with you and have them watch your baby in the hotel while you are doing wedding stuff. Feel free to miss some activities except pics and the ceremony and some (but not all) of the reception.\n\nOr go the day of the wedding and return home that evening, even if it means you'll be missing some of the reception. 2.5 hours is not that significant of travel time where I'm from.\n\nThe bride's unwillingness to compromise is troubling, but you can compromise. It's not your place to submarine the wedding or put your foot down. It's your place to support your brother and take care of your baby and if there is a way you can do both, you should.\n\nSix months after our daughter was born, my hubby and I got a short weekend break with a trip to Vegas while our inlaws watched our baby. We missed her like crazy, but we also enjoyed the break. I don't think I would have been ready for that at 3 months, though. Good luck, and work it out.", "Is there a way that you can rent an air bnb or hotel for your in laws close to the wedding venue, so that you can still be close by? Would they be okay with that?", "Confused. 3 hours away. Baby stays with inlaws overnight, go home next day. \n\nOr...inlaws stay at hotel, wherever you are,  you go to ceremony see baby after wedding. \n\nYou and brother making it too complicated.", "Info- why would you need to be away for 3 days if the venue is only 2.5 hours away? And why can\u2019t your in-laws travel with you and stay with your baby at the hotel while you\u2019re at the wedding?", "Info \n\nWhy don't you just get an airbnb that your inlaws also stay at and they can baby sit there? That way you're not 2 hours away for the weekend. You can see your kid every day of the festivities.", "Info: Can you bring your in laws with you to where the wedding is and get them and the baby a hotel or an air bnb or something so that the baby isn\u2019t at the wedding but also isn\u2019t hours away from you?", "Info: can your in laws come and stay in the same town as the wedding? Rent a big enough air BNB for everyone?", "Surprised by the YTA. They can\u2019t have it both ways. I\u2019m pretty open to being away from my daughter but would not have been at only 3 months. I would have left her with my husband for a night but no one else. You offered to not be in the wedding, and they won\u2019t accept that. I think that\u2019s completely reasonable. Or maybe just you are in the wedding and your husband stays home?", "Bring your in-laws with you & have them stay with the baby at the hotel during the wedding. This is easily solvable. Don\u2019t be the AH", "I\u2019m with KeepLkngFortintlgnce.  Why can\u2019t you put out your in-laws up at the hotel with the baby?  Problem solved.  But, it\u2019s also your brother\u2019s wedding and his fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t be making decisions based only on her desires. But, you are making this extremely difficult for your brother at a time he should be enjoying making plans.  Put the in-laws up at the hotel if they are willing and be a happy part of your brothers wedding!", "NTA.\n\nAll the Y T A votes make me feel like no one is considering that it sounds like your *brother* is also unhappy with his fiancee's unwillingness to compromise. You offered the compromise of coming as just guests so you don't have to be gone multiple days, which seems most reasonable to me for your part. That upsets your brother, though, as he wants you there beside him for his big day. So your brother, who is *the other half of the couple being married*, offered some compromises that his fiancee is not happy with. She won't compromise her dream venue or her child-free stance for the sake of anyone, not even her future husband.\n\nYes, she has a right to want what she wants for her wedding. But her husband also has a say! It's not just the bride who gets to have a say in the planning! It's not that she's unwilling to compromise for the sake of OP's happiness, she is unwilling to compromise for the happiness of the *person she is marrying*. It does not bode well.", "Well you really can't demand that they (she) accommodate your child at a child free wedding so I say slight YTA for that. The problem is that you offered to drop out so that you could still be there to support them but not for 3 days away from your newborn and that was a lovely non-assholey compromise. I am wondering...can the in-laws come with (you and husband's treat of course) and maybe have an adjoining room with you guys so that you will be with baby before and after the festivities?", "NTA. It's so weird that everyone is ignoring that you offered to just be a guest and your BROTHER wants to accommodate you. It's also weird that your brother's fianc\u00e9 won't compromise with HIM. Her reasons are also very selfish. He wants his family there but she's concerned with a dream venue. Is a wedding about the venue or the love between a couple?? If I was in your brother's shoes, I would think long and hard (\ud83c\udf1d) about marrying her because how incredibly selfish could you be to not even consider a compromise with your partner? The wedding doesn't belong solely to the woman, contrary to what society wants us to believe. It's his wedding too.", "I think I have to go against the grain with a NTA.\nYou made compromises like dropping out of the wedding party, for the weddingto be childsfree. Your brother wants you in the party. It would be unresanable to leave your 3m old alone for multiple days.\n\nIt's on your brother and your FSIL to get their wishes and plans straight.", "NTA, your brother is the groom and it is also his wedding. He wants you to be in his wedding but his fiance seems to think it's all about her. You are just trying to be there for your brother the way he wants you to be there and his fiance is making that impossible.", "So I\u2019m a bit confused by the Y T A votes because he offered to just be a guest? It looks like OP tried to find a compromise and at this point it\u2019s become an issue between OP\u2019s brother and his fianc\u00e9? \n\nNTA because you tried to find a compromise but it\u2019s between them at this point. You offered to be just a guest and your brother said no. Im seeing a lot of suggestions with your in laws in a near by room, at this point would it be easier to get an airbnb and stepping down from some of the party duties?\n\nEdit: she to he, OP didn\u2019t give a gender but I saw others referring to them as a male", "It\u2019s a difficult one as I get why you\u2019d not want to leave your new baby far away. Is there a hotel near by that in-laws could maybe be with the baby so you won\u2019t be so far. I wouldn\u2019t expect the bride to change her venue as it\u2019s her day, BUT, would it be a big deal having a newborn there? It\u2019s not as if the wee one will be running around causing havoc.", "I don\u2019t understand\n\nYou\u2019re likely staying wherever this wedding is, right? Why can\u2019t you pay for your in-laws to stay at the same hotel or close by?\n\nI\u2019m really unable to understand why you\u2019d have a place to stay and in-laws don\u2019t? Why do they need to be invited to the wedding to be close by??\n\nYTA for this weird drama that you\u2019re creating", "NAH- either you or husband will need to drop out of groomsman duties though (husband makes sense as its your brother). 3 months is too young for a multi day babysitter though. Perhaps in-laws can come for a day or two?", "NTA - I'm gonna get downvoted but I don't care.\n\nThe bride and groom need to change their perspective. It's not him against her, it's them against the problem.\n\nYou're not comfy being away from your kid so you wanted to decline. Your brother decided that having you there means more to him then material things.\nYou didn't push, you gave solutions for instance being a guest. \n\nThe bride wants the 'perfect wedding', but at what cost? If the roles were reversed and my fiance prioritised the dream over my family I wouldn't look at him the same. Its their wedding and not only hers. \n\nHOWEVER, time to think together for a solution instead of fighting each other like kids. Maybe book a hotelroom for your in laws nearby. The kid and inlaws don't have to be part of the wedding. The grandparents can have a weekend outting with the grandkid and spend quality time together. While you are at the wedding but still close enough to see the baby regularly.", "YTA\n\nThe accommodations you are asking for are not minor, they are *major*.  While the groom might be willing to acquiesce, it's perfectly reasonable for a bride not to want the VENUE to be changed due to one guests' familial preferences or to have a newborn infant at the ceremony.  I mean, the whole reason people do childfree weddings is to stop children from interrupting the ceremony, and that's all but a guarantee with a newborn.  But hey, you know that.  You opted for a childfree wedding yourself, so you get it.  \n\nFrankly, it sounds like your brother has an issue with wanting to cater to everyone else and not prioritizing his bride's wishes.  She's hardly a bridezilla for wanting to stick to major things they BOTH agreed upon like the venue and it being childfree.  The wedding SHOULD be about the bride and groom.  Not what the guests want. So if your brother's priority is moving heaven and earth for his guests instead of making sure his future spouse is happy with her wedding, then he's the one out of line.   \n\nHonestly, you should have asked for help so your infant could be with you for those 3 days, but not at the ceremony.  Could they help you get your in-laws hotel rooms where you are staying so they can watch the baby? That would have been the ask when she texted you. As a bride myself, a couple hundred out of the wedding budget to help the best man be there for the groom would have been a very doable ask. Heck, I would even have welcomed the in-laws at the various wedding meals (though not the ceremony due to newborns being naturally disruptive).  But depending on how you responded, that door may be closed now.", "NTA. If you didn\u2019t offer to drop out of the wedding party, you\u2019d be TA, but you gave options and none of them were accepted. It\u2019s reasonable for you to not want to leave your infant for several days, considering you\u2019re both in the wedding party. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re getting so many negative judgements, when it seems you were trying to make it work for everyone.", "YTA if you push this. If it really bothers you to be away from your kid then send your regrets.  OR, bring your inlaws along and get them a hotel room to watch the baby.  You'll spend a lot more money, but your baby won't be far from you.", "NTA- people here saying you are the AH are doing for without read properly. They see \"I want to bring my child to a childfree wedding\" and don't read anymore. It's not a reasonable ask to want a parent of a newborn spend three days away from them. You offered the compromise of not being part of the wedding party, but you are valuable to your brother and he doesn't want that. People are reading like you are the one who suggest that they change the venue or being your in-laws. It was your brother. The only problem here is the fianc\u00e9 who is turning down every solution and that shows she doesn't care about her own future husband or his family.", "NTA. Please ask your brother to work out a solution with his fiancee and to let you know. You\u2019ve offered so many solutions, so this is not a matter of your being difficult. Your soon-to-be SIL should not have come to you and asked you to drop it.", "YTA \n\nGet your in laws a room next to yours and maybe shorten the trip. \n\nI don\u2019t feel as though the bride is being mean or unfair by not *changing* the venue entirely. It\u2019s her wedding too, not just your brother\u2019s. She should\u2019ve been included in this convo from the start. \n\nSomeone has to care about the ceremony, venue, and logistics of the wedding. It\u2019s also interesting to me that you had a child free wedding, but her refusing to accommodate your child for her wedding is her \u201cshowing her true colors\u201d.", "Sorry but YTA. Why not have your in-laws come to the hotel with you and just watch baby during the wedding for a few hours? You guys could even go check on baby! That\u2019s what I would do if I were in your position. Huge congratulations!", "Yeah YTA.\n\"I'm fine with childfree weddings but not when it's MY child.\"\nLmao. \nDon't you think other parents might have similar issues?", "YTA, have someone come along and watch the baby in your hotel or wherever you are staying. It\u2019s their big day and having them change the venue is an unreasonable ask. The bride by your own admission is being polite about it, don\u2019t be an ass.", "YTA. You got to have your child free wedding, stop demanding that she give up hers. The wedding isn\u2019t about you so stop causing trouble. Get a room at the hotel for your in-laws and have them stay there with your baby during the wedding. She shouldn\u2019t have to give up the wedding of her dreams over your feelings.", "Yta. As someone who is going through the same thing right now.", "YTA. They\u2019ve likely already paid a deposit that they\u2019d forfeit if they change venue at this point. And you got to have a child free wedding and made others figure out childcare plans to make it happen. Handle it. You\u2019re a parent and this is literally part of parenting. If this is so insurmountable for you then don\u2019t go. But don\u2019t ask them to compromise on their wedding day dreams because of your anxiety. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t have your in laws care for baby at a nearby air bnb and then you are in and out as you\u2019re able to check on things. \n\nHandle it. Don\u2019t expect everyone else to rearrange their plans for you. Ridiculous.", "It pains me to say it but yta. The solution here is to either attend without your husband and child or have your in laws stay in the same town for a few days so you could see baby throughout the weekend. Not inviting your siblings child is always an odd choice to me but i\u2019m obviously in the minority on that", "Unfortunately YTA. It\u2019s their wedding and if they want it to be child free and not make an exception that\u2019s that and you shouldn\u2019t be pushing it. May sound harsh but the day isn\u2019t about you and your husband or your child. It\u2019s probably a big ask but could your in laws travel with you and not attend the wedding to look after your baby?", "I\u2019m going go against others here and actually say NTA. \n\nI had a child free wedding with 1 rule, if the child was under 1, understanding they still need their mom usually then they were welcome to attend. \n\nWe never had any kids show up, we had one friend who was going to attend but their kid was having a hard time bottle feeding so she didn\u2019t make it but he husband did. \n\nBut under 1 is unreasonable IMO to ask parents to leave their kid, especially for 3 days! The brides true colours for family first are showing with her lack of willingness to compromise. \n\nCan you book a hotel room where you will be staying for your in-laws and have them stay for 3 days to watch the baby when needed? \nI don\u2019t agree with them going to the wedding but doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t stay at a hotel where you are to help.", "YTA. \n\nShe's not *showing her true colors \u2014* if anything, you are. She just wants her wedding to be childfree, and she has every right to set that boundary. You are being incredibly entitled and self-centered.", "YTA. And so is your brother for seemingly prioritizing your wants over his future wife. It's ridiculous to expect your sibling to move their venue to accommodate you. Take away the fact that they chose it together for a reason, but they have absolutely already put a deposit down for this venue that they would likely lose by canceling with them. So that's an unreasonable. \n\nYour next \"compromise\" is inviting your in laws and making an exception so they can bring your baby. To a child free wedding. You had a child free wedding yourself, so you of all people should know that once you make an exception for one it's expected you can make it for others. And every mom and dad who had to pay for a sitter are going to be pissed when they see that your baby was allowed to come. Again, unreasonable. \n\nIt's really sad that your brother is backing you on this. This would be a red flag for me, I hope this isn't a pattern of behavior of him putting his family above his fiance and decisions they made together.", "YTA. It's not about you enjoying yourself - it's your brother's day and you are returning the favour he did for you at your own wedding. You're creating unnecessary tension when there is a perfectly good child care solution available at your in-laws'. You could even bring them to the same location and get them a hotel room to mind your child so at least you're seeing him for all but a few hours.", "YTA.  You want your in laws to babysit, pay for a hotel fir them and gave them babysit.  There is no reason they need to be invited to the wedding and there is no reason they can\u2019t babysit at the hotel.  They can face time you during the reception.  Such a hypocrite, I had a child free wedding, but now that I might have a kid, others have to change so their wedding revolves around me.", "NTA\nYou asked.  Answer was no.  Time to pull out of the wedding party and send your regrets.\n\nIf they want to take this child free thing to the end then so be it.  It seems like such a shame to choose that as their hill to die on, but I guess tell them you\u2019ll watch the video \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "When their oldest was 3 1/2 months old, my sister and BIL attended a child free wedding.  I stayed in the nearby hotel with the baby and my sister left the reception to come check on us for a while.", "NTA\u2026I\u2019m assuming I read an edit or something before these y.t.a\u2019s but I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d have to drive down for the rehearsal dinner, stay all day for the ceremony/reception, and then come back the following day.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re offering to go just as guests and only stay the one night and it\u2019s your brother who\u2019s being the hardass for requiring you to be in the party and his fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t compromise for him then it\u2019s their issue, not yours. If you\u2019re not demanding to be in the wedding party and perfectly ok with being just a guest then I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re being an asshole.\n\nThe only thing I can think if you want to be nice is skip the rehearsal dinner (after you\u2019ve been to one wedding you know it requires no planning to walk down the aisle and figure out your cue to walk) and drive down for the day, not drink, and drive back to be back with your child\u2026not saying it wouldn\u2019t be annoying but 2.5 hours is 100% doable and if it means that much to your brother for both of you to be in the wedding you could make it happen without being away from your child for a long period of them there are solutions here", "I'd say NAH.\n\nYou'll have a couple month old baby, it makes sense you wouldn't want to spend that many days away from him. \n\nIt also makes sense that your brother wants you there because you're close and I think it's lovely he's fighting so hard to have you both there.\n\nIt also makes sense that the bride is upset that her wedding may be turning to shambles. Depending on the size of the wedding and timeframe, it's not so simple as to \"change the venue\" and I'd imagine if she's chosen one so far away, there's a big reason why. \n\nIt's a sucky situation but I think everyone involved as their fair reasons for being upset and not wanting to budge. Could you potentially discuss the situation with just the bride? See if she has any ideas on different compromises? \n\nAnother potential, could you pay for the babysitter (your in laws, I believe?) to have their own hotel room?\n\nIf she absolutely refuses to even consider any compromise at all, then she's definitely an AH, but I'd still be inclined to ask why.", "NTA  and all of the people saying otherwise probably don't have the experience of a close family member demanding a 3 day separation from their newborn baby.   I understand that people have different family dynamics, but I can tell you missing my brother's wedding would have set off WWIII in my family.  It's not as simple as just not attending.  \n\nOP and his husband should step down from their wedding party duties and attend as guests, while the in-laws watch their baby for a day.  The brother might be upset, but it is his problem to figure out a compromise, not OP's.  \n\nAnd OP--I just want to give you props for putting your baby and your nuclear family first.  I know you obviously love your brother as well, but you have your priorities straight.", "NAH. But just ask your in laws if they would be willing to stay at a hotel with your kid. That way they are close and you can relax without the bride having to give up her dream.", "NTA. I always get down voted but child-free weddings where you invite close family members seem ridiculous. Children are part of families. They deserve to participate in family events and families are better with them around. There are many things kids shouldn\u2019t go to but a wedding isn\u2019t one of them.", "Wow, I dont think people are even reading the post before throwing out these \"YTA\" judgements.\n\nYou're NTA, but unfortunately that doesn't magically solve the problem. So I think you are going to have to follow the advice of other posters and bring your in-laws along for the trip and keep them nearby.", "I'm actually really surprised by all of the Y T A comments and they all sound like they didn't really read your post. \n\nA lot of people are saying just not to attend or attend simply as guests, which you claimed to have offered as a compromise after explaining why you weren't comfortable leaving your newborn for an extended period of time. Your brother declined and made it clear that he wanted you there as part of the wedding party. At that point, it becomes up to him to figure out how to have you there as part of the wedding. \n\nI feel this is a situation of boundaries more than anything else. You clearly stated your boundary about attending the wedding as the best man/groomsman - accommodation for your baby. Your brother's fiancee asking you to \"drop it,\" reads to me as overstepping that boundary because it doesn't really seem like you're pushing anything (again, you are/were fine with attending as guests), and it is your brother who is pushing the matter as he wants you there by his side (understandably so). Sounds like a relational issue they have to work out that you just happen to be in the middle of. \n\nSome others have suggested bringing along your in-laws, so your baby won't be far. See if your brother may be able to help with that compromise. Either way, NTA. Best of luck and I hope things work out for everyone!", "YTA. Your brother's fiancee isn't the one showing her true colors. You had a child-free wedding and now want an exception carved out because it's your kid. Either hire a sitter and fortify yourself with some Xanax or apologize and drop from the wedding party so you can be with your new kid. Stop trying to make your brother's wedding about you.", "YTA. Don't get me wrong, I do understand, but they are allowed to have a child free wedding and do not have to accommodate you. You're the one who needs to do the accommodating. When my college friend had her wedding, and I had no choice to bring the kids, they stayed in the hotel nearby with my sister. Having your in-laws come with and handling your baby nearby would absolutely be a good way for everyone to get what they want - but instead you want to invalidate the Bride and cause discord for her wanting to have her one day.", "YTA\n\nThis is their wedding. It's child free. They don't need to make an exception for you, and if they did, it would be a slap in the face to other parents attending in a similar situation. It's child free for a reason. \n\nIt is their wedding. They don't need to work it around your needs. You said you have someone who can babysit and you'll just have to manage your anxiety. If you wanna go, again, it is THEIR wedding and their rules.", "YTA. There's a lot of ways to solve this that don't involve you abandoning your small child for three days. Bring a babysitter with you. Find a local babysitter. Go back-n-gettem the next day? It's not that far. Don't become someone's problem at their wedding.", "YTA.

Goading your brother into changing things around to suit you is AH, thinking you have any standing to \"put your foot down\"... even more so. \n\nIt's a wedding.

We all know women hold a different view on weddings we grew up being taught that. She wants her perfect wedding at her perfect venue just let her have that.  Not to mention it sounds like she has been really respectful about this whole thing  but I do think you are wrong to keep bring it up when she already said she wasn't budging.

He and I have always been close and he was the best man at our (much smaller) ceremony. At the time I committed to this obligation, no real planning had taken place so everyone was on standby waiting for further details and an official date.\n\nI'm not sure when they began properly planning things, but I didn't hear much more about it until November during our Thanksgiving family gathering. My brother's fianc\u00e9e told us the venue, the date, and the fact that the wedding was going to be child-free. Now, I have no issue with the concept of child-free weddings -- I had one myself. The problem is that my husband and I are expecting a baby. If all goes well with our surrogate's pregnancy (fingers crossed), our son will be 3 months old by the wedding date given. The venue they've chose is one 2.5 hours from where we live. We would likely be spending three days away from home.\n\nYou call me an overprotective first time parent, but the thought of both my husband and I being away from our child for that long when he's so little scares me, and he's not even here yet. My in-laws could watch him and I trust them completely, but I know I wouldn't be able to properly enjoy the festivities if my infant is over two hours away from me. I pulled my brother aside later in the night and apologized profusely while explaining my worries. He said he understood and offered up a venue change (one much closer to home) or maybe making an exception for me by inviting my in-laws to the wedding, that way I could see the baby during the ceremony and feel a little less stressed. I told him either would work for me and thanked him.\n\nHe spoke to his fianc\u00e9e, but she won't budge on either issue. He's vented to me multiple times over the course of the month that has now passed about how he's really frustrated because what matters most to him is making sure he's surrounded by the people he loves and that they are comfortable. Meanwhile his fianc\u00e9e continually repeats that she's not giving up her 'dream venue and ceremony.'  I told him my husband and I could just attend as guests instead if it would make things easier, but he immediately shut me down and said he wanted us by his side.\n\nShe texted me yesterday (politely, I'll admit) asking if I could please just drop things with my brother. I might have considered it previously, but hearing how she turned down all of my brother's requests for compromise made me put my foot down and refuse. I hate causing my brother trouble like this, especially so close to the holidays, but I feel like she's showing her true colors. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I did however attend as a joyful guest.", "The best option for this is to go to the wedding and pay for your in-laws to come with you, treat it as a break for them and they take your son purely for the hours of the wedding.\n\nI've been a best man at a wedding with a toddler and it wasn't a child free wedding, just knew it would only be enjoyable for a finite period and therefore I'd not be able to enjoy myself.", "NAH - It feels to me like the issue is more that OPs brother and brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e have different things they want to prioritize for the wedding, and the fianc\u00e9e is blaming OP for that. Fianc\u00e9e and brother are definitely allowed to have the kind of wedding they want - it sounds like one of them wants her dream wedding and the other wants to be surrounded by happy and comfortable loved ones, and they aren\u2019t aligning on how to make both happen. OP offered to come as a guest instead of being in the wedding party so that he could have less responsibilities and be back to his baby more quickly, and they weren\u2019t accepting of that option.

You couldn't manage it.", "NTA - you reasonably explained the situation to your brother. He offered a couple of different compromises (very generous of him), you were flexible and said either would work, as well as offering the alternative that you drop out of the bridal party so it\u2019s only a one-day event for you. Your brother obviously wants you there as a priority. The bride is welcome to her child-free perfect wedding, you\u2019re not disputing that. But the disagreement is actually between her and your brother, not you. Your brother prioritises your attendance as a member of the wedding party, the bride prioritises her location and child-free wedding. \n\nUltimately, you\u2019ve put your boundaries down and the fact that they can\u2019t agree isn\u2019t your problem. You can\u2019t just \u2018drop it\u2019 because you\u2019re still in an impossible situation. It\u2019s insane as a new parent to leave your child over 2 hours away for at least 3 days, even if it is with in-laws you trust. The couple need to decide whether they want you in the wedding party, or whether they want their dream location, or whether they want it to be totally child free. It\u2019s unfeasible to have all of those things.\n\nRealistically, I think you need to tell your future-SIL that you are already trying to be reasonable but you can\u2019t attend as a member of the wedding party given the circumstances, and you\u2019ve already offered to drop out but your brother refused. And, you need to speak to your brother and tell him that you don\u2019t want to cause fights but they need to work out what\u2019s best for the two of them because you\u2019ve tried to be flexible but if nothing can be decided, you need to drop out of the wedding party as you originally offered.\n\nIn this situation, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll end up needing to drop out, but this fight certainly isn\u2019t on you. All of the \u2018Y-T-A\u2019 votes here are harsh, they don\u2019t seem to recognise that you have offered to drop out, it\u2019s your brother that\u2019s creating a fight with his fianc\u00e9.", "NAH.\n\nThe Y T As are funny to me. \n\n\"Don't demand things\", OP isn't demanding anything except to know what they'd prefer he do.

Yes, ask, see if you can \"bribe\" them but people here are acting like there's no possible way they could have their own feelings on this. \n\nSounds like there's a breakdown in communication between the bride and groom and op just happens to be a conduit.

That's where OP becomes TA.  When the bride approached him politely, OP should have tried to work with her to find a solution.  It's not OP's wedding, and OP should be willing to find a way to put the bride's preferences first in a way that works for his family.  \n\nI will say though, I do think OP knows who his brother is and \"expressed anxiety\" as a passive-aggressive way to see if he could get the brother to do exactly what he did.  I have never heard a member of the bridal party \"express anxiety\" about the venue.

Either way, they made decisions together, they agreed on these things together. And now he's going back on them, that's a fucked up thing to do especially when there's so much money and stress involved in wedding planning. Like I said, if they move the venue they lose potentially thousands of dollars. If they make an expectation for the baby, they need to either deal with other pissed off family or invite all the kids.

You and your husband have been asked for a favor and are trying to find a way to do that favor that works for you.

That said, to the comment or comparing the ask you\u2019d make of them to the one being made of the fianc\u00e9e, I think you\u2019re asking a hell of a lot more of your in-laws than allowing one exception to the child-free rule.\n\nMost importantly: congratulations to you and your husband on the impending birth of your son!\n\nYou are NTA, and he will be lucky to grow up with dads who will teach and model the right way to treat people.", "Oops my bad!!!", "And as I've been saying, the solutions he provided are not reasonable.

It's that its not an Apples to Apples comparison. You have different time commitments, different locations and expections. So, while it may be easier for guests to arrange for care of a newborn, it would be way more difficult (due to time constraints alone) for OP and his husband, both who are in the wedding party, as important people to the groom.

It could be prohibitively expensive, the in-laws may not be willing, so on and so forth. \n\nRegardless of any of that, the point still stands that OP did not ask for the change of venue. OP's compromise was spot on--be a guest, not a party member, only have to be there for 1 day. Bro hated that option, and he's the one who offered the compromise of venue. FSIL says no.
