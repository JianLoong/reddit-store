She was diagnosed with a manageable chronic condition which had caused irreversible kidney damage. She has her condition under control and lives a relatively normal and healthy life. \r  \nIt was discussed at the time that she would eventually need a kidney transplant. There was never much discussion with my parents and sibling, it was a given that I would do it. And I had no objection, of course I would. \r  \nSo then about 6 months ago, the possibility of donating the kidney came up again. Again I was on board. There is a significant risk with pregnancies following donation so myself and my partner chatted and agreed that the reward was worth the risk. We have been together about a year and a half and we are in the process of buying a house and wanted to get married before starting a family. \r  \nI went to my doctor to begin the standard tests but all was halted when the first one came back positive, I was pregnant. My partner and I were thrilled, it wasn't planned but a welcome surprise. I was about estimated about 8 weeks along. I realized I would have to tell my family sooner than usual given as this put an immediate halt on the transplant. \r  \nMyself and my husband drove to the city they live in the following week. My parents were at the kitchen table when I walked in and I just made the announcement there and then. Their immediate reaction was that I could \"take care of it\" and I was shocked. They said I had promised to do this to save her life and this would just complicate plans already in motion. I think I just shut down, I told them in no uncertain terms that I was keeping my baby and would donate after the baby was born, then left. \r  \nMy parents rang me later to re-iterate their POV. I could hear my sister in the background screaming. They called me selfish and tried to guilt me by saying I could have a baby anytime but her life had been ruined by her condition and I was depriving her of living a somewhat normal life. I was more prepared for this call and had told them I keeping my baby. I might not even be a match and her health is not in danger, she actually has a good quality of life at the moment. I also lost control and pointed out that the surgery I was agreeing to was very risky and I needed to consider it more carefully in the context of my family, going forward they are my priority.  \r  \nWe have continued the pregnancy and my relationship with family continues to be strained. My brother absolutely respects my decision and has been clear with the rest of our family. Now my partner has broached the topic of not doing the transplant at all. He's being doing more research on the topic and he's anxious about the long list of complications especially now that we have a family to prioritize. Honestly I said it in anger but I'm now really considering it...AITA?\r  \nNote: My brother cannot donate owing to a medical condition and neither of my parents are considered suitable due to age.", "created_utc": 1688505749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qrdyb/wibta_if_i_didnt_donate_my_kidney/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your life and your family needs to take precedence over your sister's need for a kidney.  Her doctor can put her on a transplant list.  After the baby is born you will no doubt be pressured to be tested for a match.  Go ahead with that appointment and tell them that your family is pressuring you to do it and that you don't want to donate.  They can then tell your sister that you aren't a match.  Congratulations on the baby.", "NTA.  You do not owe her your kidney.  Kidneys are pretty fragile filters of the body, and that's why they end up failing for people even though people generally have 2.  And it's not true that she will die unless she gets your kidney in the immediate future. People can live for years on dialysis, but it's true the quality of life would improve after a successful kidney transplant.   Plus like you mentioned you don't know if you are a match for her yet.  She would need to be on antirejection meds indefinitely and there is no guarantee that her body won't reject your kidney.  It's rare but as a nurse I've taken care of more than one person who's kidney transplants didn't succeed.  There is just no way you are TA for not giving up your kidney especially in the light of the recent changes to you.", "YWNBTA. It's your kidney. That you were willing to donate it up until this unexpected turn if events was incredibly generous of you. That your parents and sister had the unmitigated gall to tell you to terminate your pregnancy so she wouldn't have to wait... wow. Just... wow. Personally, I'd wish her luck with the donor registry because I wouldn't have the mental fortitude to still donate after their antics.", "NTA. No one is entitled to your body parts, previous promise or not. And anyone, ANYONE, who told me to abort my baby would never hear from me again.", "Please tell me this is a troll post, it\u2019s just so unbelievably horrific.you are not a spare parts depot for anyone, and your families suggestion you\u2018d get an abortion to give your kidney to your sister, who is not dying, would be enough for me to tell them to shove their words to where the sun doesn\u2019t shine. I also agree with your partner, there are real risks to be a kidney donor, which I would not be willing to take for these awful people.\n\nNTA (I forgot that first time around)", "NTA. It's your body and you are the only one who can decide if you're going to donate anything or not. Period.\n\nThe fact that you're only saying \"no\" due to your pregnancy is all the more reason your family should be more understanding.\n\nWhy is it that your brother's and your parents' reasons to not donate are respected but your reason isn't?", "NTA, you are not a spare part for your sister and the way you have been treated I would urge you to not donate your kidney at all.", "NTA. \n\nHave you done any of the testing at all? Has anyone? What are the chances you could have the same health issue come up? Is it genetic? Is your brothers condition genetic? \n\nFirst (I have two daughters with kidney disease so I know a little about this) it was not great to agree to donate before talking to a doctor and doing general blood work to find if you could even donate. The first step would have been an agreement to get tested.  \n\nSecond - the fact that your parents would tell you to kill your baby just to take a minute chance you could donate shares they should not be a part of you or your child\u2019s life.  Fear for their child ain\u2019t an excuse. \n\nNot only would I not donate - I don\u2019t think I would have anything to do with them in the future period.", "NTA. But why all the drama with everyone when you don't even know if you are an option/match?", "NTA. You agreed at one point in time when circumstances were different. Time has past and your life is in a different place than what it was back then. You are now looking at getting married and have a baby on the way that will need you.\n\nYour family needs to realize that a kidney transplant affects more than just the one receiving it.", "NTA\nThey literally expected you to kill your child (their grandchild/niece, I might add) so you could donate a kidney. They are angry that you did not. They are massive AHs.", "NTA - All that hysteria and HLA testing hasn't even been done to even know if you are an actual match with your sister. Ridiculous.", "NTA.  If the answer isn\u2019t hell yes, then the answer is hell no.\n\nThe most important eligibility criteria is your informed and non-coerced consent.  If you don\u2019t want to do this, you don\u2019t have to, regardless of previous promises.  You can say no until the moment they anesthetize you..  Some people go to the match testing and say \u201cmy family is pressuring me and I don't want to do this.  Will you help me?\u201d  Doctors can and will say you are not a viable match for donation, because at that point, you aren\u2019t.", "You\u2019re SO is correct/ kidney donation is not without risk. Now that you are a becoming a parent, you will have to rethink the risk.", "NTA. Wow. Talk about selfish (not your brother, but your mom and dad and to a lesser extent your sister certainly are.)  I'm frankly appalled by their reaction.\n\nAlso I agree with your husband. Once your child is born, it needs a mother. Transplant operations and the resulting not having a reserve kidney are risky. Your first and foremost duty has to be to your primary family...child and husband.\n\nIf mom dad and sis won't back off then I'd suggest going VLC with them. You don't need their emotional blackmail. And congratulations on the upcoming LO!", "NTA. TBH, if you have any doubts or reservations whatsoever, you might not even be allowed to. Where I'm from there are really strict rules about who is eligible to donate due ti safety and mental health concerns of the donor. \n\nYou do not owe anyone a piece of your body. That's all there is to it.", "INFO. Would you not have know that you were a match by the time they tested you for being pregnant? When I attempted to donate a kidney I did a couple other tests until I got to the urologist , who told me I was not eligible.", "NTA. In order to manage your relationship with your family, go to the screening and tell them your family is passing you. They'll tell your family you aren't a match.", "NTA How could OP's  own mother want her to get rid of the  baby? Telling OP that she can always have another baby is wrong, maybe OP couldn't. That kind of surgery always involves risks. Yes, OP loves her sister, but she has her own family now, and that takes priority.", "NTA ...it is your body and yours only...YOU get to decide", "NTA, both of your siblings have medical conditions.  There is a chance you could also developed issues.  You need to totally shut them out of your life.  They wanted you to terminate your pregnancy and do a procedure that does put you at a higher risk for future pregnancies.  Most of all, think about how they will treat your child.  What remarks will they make to the child as it grows up.", "NTA. Telling you to abort your baby is your hill to die on. Yes, donors are needed but the process is no walk in the park. Recovery time for the donor can be quite a while. Not good for a new mom. Also, you may not be a match at all.", "NTA. As others said, play the game and go for the testing/evaluation. Tell them your family is putting enormous pressure on you and I would include that they wanted you to terminate your pregnancy so you could donate to your sister because in their words \u201cYou can have a baby whenever\u201d. They will absolutely disqualify you for donation. The only thing they will say is that you are not a match.\n\nOn another note, your brother has a medical issue, your sister has a kidney issue so you could have medical issues that just aren\u2019t known. Add to the fact that what if your child inherits the kidney disease your sister has? Again, not saying you\u2019d be a match to your daughter but you wouldn\u2019t obviously be able to even offer if you have already donated to your sister.", "I stopped reading mid way...YTA. \n\nThis looks like a bullshit story from anti abortion nuts...what parents are going to say...\"lets take care of it\" as if abortion is the first thing that comes to mind when a potential grandchild is coming. \n\nPeople can live on dialisis for a long long time,...this would be known by anyone who had a read kidney issue, surely long enough to give birth then do the donation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do not even believe i just typed that.....\n\nYour partner sounds like a smart man.", "You obviously shouldn't do it before baby is born or in the postpartum recovery period. Whether or not it's okay to do it after that, idk. I think it's up to you. I'll be praying you find the right way forward.", "NTA. I'm trying to think how it would even be possible to continue any relationship with people who wanted you to so cavalierly \"take care of it\".\n\nThe surgery is not with out complications for both parties. The surgery might not be successful for your sister. Your sister can receive dialysis. Your sister can be on a transplant list. You weren't even ascertained to be an eligible donor. And they still wanted you to....\n\nIt would be best to concentrate on your growing family.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m really sorry, OP. It\u2019s awful that their reaction to your news was anything other than joyous, let alone what it *actually* was.\n\nI understand that this was a shock for your sister, but the continued entitlement from her and your parents is just \u2026 wow. All arguments that they should care about and for your and your baby aside, they\u2019re not really positioning themselves favourably for you to *want* to risk your health to help your sister, are they?\n\nWishing you all the best with the birth and parenthood. \n\n(And if they call not to congratulate you but to say \u2018Right, that\u2019s done, now let\u2019s schedule the surgery,\u2019 block them. Immediately.)", "NTA but.... I think you should speak to a medical professional and get a better idea of the potential risk. A lot of information on the internet can be true and very slanted at the same time. If your sister is stable now could you donate in the future? I can see why your parents are upset - yes it is your kidney but facing that their other daughter might die is tough too. And you don't even know if you're a match so the whole thing may be moot anyway.", "NTA \n\nSince it sounds like you care about a relationship with your family, the solution is to lie. \n\nI went through the kidney transplant process with both my grandma and aunt. The doctors will disqualify you if you ask. Not only that, but they will speak to your sister directly to let her know that you have been disqualified as a donor. \n\nSo tell your family that you\u2019ll go back for an evaluation after your pregnancy. When you call to schedule, tell them you don\u2019t want to do it. They\u2019ll take it from there. The initial meeting is actually with a patient advocate/social worker and maybe the Dr.", "NTA obviously. I think this is worthy of never speaking to your parents again. Certainly they should not get to ever meet your baby. I\u2019d cut them off permanently for telling you to get rid of your child.", "This OP. At least in the US, having doubts about donating automatically disqualifies you. And due to HIPPA rules it is illegal for the doctors to disclose why you are disqualified. Besides the transplant establishment is ethically opposed to family pressure. They will not judge you at all.", "Yeah. I don\u2019t know what country you live in but in the US they will lie for you. That\u2019s if you want to even be in contact with these people anymore.", "Seriously. This is a post that made me very angry on OP and her husband\u2019s behalf. Her priority is her baby and I\u2019m shocked by the parents\u2019 reaction.", "This is how I feel! They all sound awful and now I wonder how they will treat you, your husband, and baby. I wouldn't give up your kidney.", "Agree. Also it sounds like you have some severe conditions that run in your family. Maybe you\u2019d like to hold on to both your kidneys in case you or your children ever get sick. Why should you donate a body part to a person who can\u2019t even extend themselves towards repairing the relationship they damaged!"]}
