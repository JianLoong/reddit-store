If she thought you were calling her out for being unprofessional by being \"cozy\" than maybe this all lines up.", "ESH\n\nObviously she is unhinged for interpreting such a normal comment like that(unless you said it in a super creepy tone) but if someone says \u201cyou made me uncomfortable don\u2019t talk to me again\u201d and you talk to them in an elevator of all places then you\u2019re an asshole for being so foolish and unaware.", "NTA. But I would write down every interaction you have had with her, keep it factual, what was said and any witnesses. Sounds like she has an issue either with you or how you come across. You could also speak to HR to mediate a session between you both because this could result in a dismissal.

If you hear her ssaying something like that again i sugegst taking it to the HR before she does. Tell HR she's spreading things abour you and making the work environment hostile. It's ridiculous that this came from that one comment.", "She is a nightmare, but in future read someone\u2019s body language before making a comment like that and ffs don\u2019t then go and re initiate small talk with a woman like that after an incident like that", "NTA\n\nSometimes you can't avoid crazy situations or paranoid people.

She didn't like it, and you moved on. Doing small talks in an elevator is absolutely normal.

She blew your initial comment out of proportion, but that's a risk when you go off-work for conversation. She asked you to leave her alone. You didn't.

I would even go as far as making a statement with hr about her spreading rumors. As well as making your work environment uncomfortable.", "NTA unless you were leering during all these exchanges. Seriously, though, you probably want to talk to your manager about the hostile work environment she has created.", "NTA.  She is being really odd.  I don't think you said anything wrong.", "I feel like there is something missing here\u2026.

You're nicer than me cause we would have had a meeting about false accusations quick fast and hostile work environment. Definitely speak not a word to her not even for help with an assignment but still tell management. You can't work with or communicate with someone who makes false accusations. Never get in the elevator with her again back turned till the door closes then call the bed one cause no.", "In a professional situation, never talking to someone again is not realistic. She needs to either go to HR and file a case or grow the hell up and act like a professional.

It\u2019s a way better thing to get out in front of this than to let her comments about you slide.", "Not everyone with mental health issues needs to be institutionalized.
