We are good friends otherwise, so your mileage may vary. If your brother has never offered to pick out, plan, or pay for gifts then just tell him he\u2019s on his own.", "NTA - and I would suggest you add in the cost of the gifts he didn\u2019t pay for this year but took credit for", "You\u2019re all adults, why do joint gifts on something costing $40? Just do separate gifts or if it\u2019s too annoying to get gifts that are expensive enough to be worth buying for adults for so many people, do a gift exchange and pick names (this is what my in laws do so everyone can get one hundred dollar gift instead of ten little ten dollar gifts)", "NTA, but don't tell them you're not putting their names on the gifts. Just don't do it so they look like the assholes they are showing up empty handed as usual, but with nobody to cover for them this time", "Weaponized incompetence - a lot of guys do this whether it\u2019s not emptying the dishwasher, not changing diapers, dropping their dirty socks right next to the hamper instead of in the hamper, etc etc etc - I get you\u2019re fed up tho.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say NTA - but also stop doing this to yourself - sign the card from just you from now on", "OP, NTA this year, but YOU NEED TO STICK TO YOUR WORD.\n\nAlso, have you ever talked to his wife about this and let her know how much money THEY owe for the gifts? Do you know if she's as unwilling to pay their share or if she's in the dark that her husband blows of reimbursing his siblings every year? If she hasn't been aware, then making her aware is a chance to let her change the dynamic.\n\nBut since you don't talk much about her, I'll go focus on your brother.\n\nI read a few of your replies. So you keep offering him this chance because he is pissy on Christmas Day if you don't. Does this same dynamic play out for any other family gift-giving occasions? If not, what is different about those times?\n\nNow back to Christmas. Stop trying to manage your brother's behavior on Christmas Day. If he's pissy; he's pissy. So it may spoil A Christmas Day for your mom. It might even repeat next Christmas. But if you don't sacrifice yourself to keep him from being pissy, in one or two Christmases, he will learn that that gets him nowhere. Or your mom will change the dynamic in her own way.\n\n(It's like toddler training. If you give in to their tantrums, they know that will get them what they want. When you say 'no.' and hold firm, they may throw a tantrum. a few times. You staying firm will teach them that tantrums don't help them. Giving in teaches them the opposite.)\n\nEven if your brother is not inclined to change, your mom may tell him that his behavior is wrong and unappreciated. She may be disappointed in him but start to see him for who he really is and not have expectations of him that are nowhere close to reality. Then his being a jerk about things gets him nothing.\n\nSo far, all your brother has learned is that he can blackmail you into paying for him to get credit for gifts if he acts like a jerk when you don't.\n\nSo for this year. Do not even give him until Christmas Day. Give him a date that works for you (but no later than Dec 21st). Tell him that if he hasn't paid by (no later than) Dec. 21st, the gift tags will be made without his/SIL's name. In fact, put it in writing in a text, including the fact this deadline has been set because he hasn't really ever paid his share in 10 years. Do not relent if he tries to play 'chicken' with you and hold out till after the 21st. Respond with, \"*Sorry the deadline is past. You have/had the weekend to go shopping.*\" (If you aren't firm about this, he'll play that game with you every year, so nip that in the bud.)", "You\u2019re a legend.", "Stop asking him then", "Write out a card with just the people paying in loud black print in the card that goes with the gift", "Based on you allowing this to happen more than once, YTA", "Me and my siblings do this for our parents\u2019 gifts.

Don't let them put this on you.\n\nIf they try to pin it on you. Return the pin \"Bro, Im sure you still have the emails and texts I sent you about pitching in on the gift.\"\n\nLet him huff and tantrum. Those are his feelings to feel, not yours to manage.  And if your mom pushes, say juat that \"Mom, those are his feeling to feel.  It isn't my responsibility to protect him from himself.\"\n\nFences make good neighbors and boundaries make healthy families.", "NTA.  He does that to himself.", "Then you are enabling him and that makes you a slight AH toy yourself and him by not making him grow the F up!", "He's acting like a child when he doesn't get his way. Be the grown up and if he complains just tell him he can venmo you right number then or shut up. Stop indulging the baby.", "> I just want her to have a stress fee holiday.\n\nThen you have a choice.\n\nIf what is *truly* most important to you is your mom having a happy day, then split the cost of the gifts with your sister and put your brother\u2019s name on the card. Your mom likely knows he didn\u2019t pick it out or pay for it, so you\u2019re not giving her any information she doesn\u2019t already have by not putting his name on the card; you\u2019re just taking away her ability to enjoy the pleasant fiction that all her kids contributed to the thoughtful gift and there\u2019s nothing to disrupt the holiday. As you said, you would have purchased the same gifts regardless of splitting with siblings, so you\u2019re not out any money either way.\n\nIf, on the other hand, what is most important is not allowing your brother to continue to take credit for things he didn\u2019t do, then just don\u2019t offer the split at all. He can sink or swim on his own, you and your mother can deal with his whining in whatever way you each see fit. \n\nBut if you\u2019re looking for a way to magically turn your brother into a person who either pays for the gift or doesn\u2019t cause a scene that upsets your mother\u2026 I think you\u2019re out of luck. You just have to make a decision amongst the things you can control (put his name on card or don\u2019t) and then be willing to accept the consequences of your choice.", "You have just described how manipulation works.", "You are enabling him. He is making himself look bad and then blaming you. Put your foot down. Y'all should have ended this a long time ago. NTA", "**He** makes himself look bad, and then **he** ruins Christmas for your mother. That has nothing to do with you. This is pretty much right in line with [Don't rock the boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/); _you_ are not the cause, and it's not your responsibility to be the solution.\n\nIf you REALLY don't want to see your mother's Christmas ruined, just wait and tell her the next day, \"You should really know that <brother> wasn't involved in the present at all. He was just too lazy to get you anything, and I didn't want the day to be ruined. He does this every holiday, actually\"", "He's making himself look bad and your letting yourself be treated like a doormat. Time to change your behaviour."]}
