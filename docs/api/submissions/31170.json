It's that simple to me. He's shown over the years you can't trust him to do it afterwards so you have to make this precaution.", "NTA, but I would expect payment before Christmas day if I were you. You are already out the money. He should pay you now.", "NTA. Don\u2019t offer anymore. Don\u2019t include him.

Still, NTA just understandably jaded. The thing is you should've cut him out when he didn't pay the first time. Now you've enabled him, and it's only gonna result in a headache.", "NTA.

The terms are clear and you\u2019re giving him a heads up so he KNOWS those are the terms.", "NTA just stop asking if they want to split. Leave their gifts completely up to them. They can do as they like, and if they ask you later on, tell them sorry, you've  already spent the money to get it yourself, and they'll  have to go it on their own this time. And then do that everytime.", "NTA.\n\nI have had so many family members and friends do stuff like this that I don't even offer anymore. Unless money is given upfront, then they are never included in what I buy. Especially if - like you say your brother does - this is a normal occurrence.", "Why did you even give him an option? You know he won't pay up, then he will bask in the thanks for the thoughtful gifts.\n\nTell him he's on his own going forward.", "NTA  When you carry the gifts in say loudly, \"Sister and I got these for you all.\" If brother tries to claim them too say, \"I don't know what you and SIL brought but only sister and I got these.\" If he tries to tell you money is a problem then tell him that he should have said that when the gifts were first mentioned but he okayed it. Also text him before the day asking if he remembered everyone's gifts that he's giving. You and sister have yours.", "NTA. Tell him you will hold off putting his name on the card until you receive his portion, otherwise he can buy his own gift", "NTA - stop asking him", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
