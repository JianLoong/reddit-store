What other expenses will you incur due to her not being home?", "NTA for asking and sitting down and working out the financials and the QOL issues with your wife. In fact, you\u2019d be the asshole if you unilaterally made a decision one way or the other without having that discussion.

If both of you work, you also have the additional costs for childcare, while both of you are at work. So sit down with her, tell her why you want to change your Job and calculate together which path makes sense the most.

Women get shorted on maternity leave as is so this is an important factor in terms of using work-provided day care, nannies, etc.", "NAH- Life doesn't always work according to plan.

Nobody is an asshole for that.", "Do you have care for your infant that doesn\u2019t require a daycare setting? \nDepending on what your wife does for work, you could just end up having her work to pay for daycare or making very little. \nYou can talk to her about it and see how she reacts and go from there.

She could look for a WFH job, or she could look for part time work in your off hours so that you aren't spending on childcare.  \n\nThis is a conversation you should have with her.", "NTA but make sure you look at all the angles. I work for a company that has both union / hourly jobs and salary/ corporate jobs. \n\nMy union co-workers get overtime- I do not. I work over, I don\u2019t get paid for it. My union co-workers have protections I don\u2019t when it comes to lay offs, salary, etc.  I can work for years and there is no guarantee that my salary will increase, or by how much.

However, if you talk with her and discuss the positive and negatives of this to you, her, the baby and your family unit, then it is just a discussion between a husband and wife.\n\nSomething to consider. If you take a huge pay cut and she goes back to work she will need to make 40K minimum to break even to your current salary. 20k to cover your income loss. 10k minimum for daycare and related expenses.

Be ready to handle pushback gracefully and to talk honestly about pros/cons. \n\nThe other commenters raise good points about childcare, budgeting, and making sure the math shakes out. Bring those points to the table with you.", "It's fair if you will look after your infant and help in the home in the hours freed up for you.  She can't do what she does now, and then also work. So some of that burden needs to be carried by you.\n\nAlso things change - its a partnership - and mothers dont need to be 100% stay at home if you can afford nurseries or have someone to care for the child when you are at work.", "NTA but before you make any move sit down and do the numbers - could your wife do part time when you're home and you watch the baby? You need to look at daycare, if this is your first child you might be in for a surprise, I have 2 grands that go to daycare for an hour and a half in the am and about 3 hours in the afternoon and it's almost a grand a month. Add in transportation and the extra income might end up negative. If your wife can find a remote position while you're home to take care of the baby it might be workable.", "I NAH but if you\u2019re amaerican or Canadian you might want to consider the potential recession threat looking. In a union gig it\u2019s hard to be laid off, with corporate Theres no such grace", "YWNBTA to ask. \n\nNeither would you be an AH if you go back to the company (HR) and ask if there is any possible wiggle room on the base salary.  $20k is a huge cut and they know that. Outline the impacts to your family, your desire to stay and grow within the company, and your role as a single earner family.  I say go to HR as they are used to these types of discussions and I have seen too many managers react negatively to salary negotiations. Also ask if there are any incentive/bonus payments included in the compensation.  Often non-union compensation tends to have more bonus opportunities.", "~~INFO: How old is your child?

You aren\u2019t asking if you should tell her and have a discussion about this career move. You are only asking if you should ask her to join the workforce, which means you\u2019ve already decided to take the job without a discussion.\n\nA discussion is a must. Bringing up the conversation like, \u201cHey honey, I was offered a different position that would take me off nights.

This is a dramatic change in opportunity for you both, and radically alters the question. You can ask, and should!

It is also something to look into the actual cost savings. While you mentioned the job could be remote, that doesn't mean that you can actually watch your child on a regular basis. So maybe it would be better for her to look into a night position, like cleaning offices or bartending. That way no money is coming out for child care. Or maybe ask her if she would be okay with watching another child or two in addition to your own (I would just look into any licensing regulations in your area), and making up the cost difference that way. Doing options like these may be a way to continue to allow her to be home with your child and prevent you from having to pay for childcare, but also bring in the extra money to help make up the difference.", "NTA but you really need to sit down at the table to discuss this, all the pros and cons. You have to factor in childcare costs. Then picking up kids and taking them to day care. Two cars needed probably. What if kids are sick? Who stays home? If she worked in the evening then she would be leaving as you arrived and you would hardly see each other and she would have child care and chores all day.
