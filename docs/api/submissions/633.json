Me (22M) and my girlfriend (23F) have a a really good relationship. We communicate with each other we don\u2019t really argue about things. \nBasically there was an event where the movie theatre in my area was having a cheap deal on movies. She told me a few of her friends were going to go. I had also been interested in going but she had told me it was going to be a girls night out, which was fine with me I\u2019d just find someone else to go with. Leading up to the day I had been asking some friends of mine and even my siblings and I had been turned down due to it being so short notice. So I figured I just wouldn\u2019t go. Which was also okay with me. \n\nNow a friend of mine who happens to be a female. Had contacted me the day before the movie to ask if I was willing to go. She picked out a movie and since it was so last minute the only theatre was downtown about 50 minutes away (due to traffic). I told her I\u2019d run it by my girlfriend then I\u2019d give her my answer. I had seen my girl shortly after to ask her and was told that it would be no problem. She has no sign of being uncomfortable or anything. So I went to the movie.\n\nFast forward so he movie was at 8pm so we got back home at 1am after the drive back and catching up a bit with her. The second I got back home I call my girl to ask her how was her night and she goes on to tell me how she had a good time. I later ask her what she if she was gonna ask me about mine and she said she wasn\u2019t interested. It was clear she was upset. \n\nShe later expressed to me that she\u2019s upset with me for going to the movie so late, and so far away. Saying I put in a lot of effort to make it happen. She\u2019s also said that she lost her trust in me from when this situation happened. Saying she doesn\u2019t know the friend I went out with.\n\nShe has hung out with guy friends before and although I had known them. I had never given her an issue with going out. Except for one that we were both aware had feelings for her and I eventually told her she couldn\u2019t see him, after we had a talk about the current situation I\u2019m writing about.\n\nNow i\u2019ll make it clear that I didn\u2019t cheat. She knows how against that I am and she also said how she doesn\u2019t think I\u2019ll cheat. And if I knew this woulda made her upset I\u2019d of never gone to the movie. \n\nThis happened maybe 2-3 months ago and she\u2019s still upset. Did I do something wrong?

When you told her you were going you didn't say how late the movie was or who the friend was? That they were female? Getting home that late I'd be a bit uneasy about it honestly. And it wasn't at the cheap theater? IDK you say yall have good communication but doesn't sound like it from this interaction shared. Sounds like a lot of bits were left out. ESH if that's the case. You for leaving out details but man multiple months ago and she's still hung up on it? If that was the only blip that's a bit of a stretch.", "Why does she feel like she can't trust you? Does your female friend have feelings for you? I only ask because you say that after this discussion you told her she couldn't hang out with one of her guy friends who has feelings for her. Why is her hanging out with him an issue now?", "Obviously NTA she said it was fine and then she's upset about what she agreed to and upset for 2-3 months. Do you really want that kind of unstable drama in your life?", "Well I\u2019m hoping we can move past it and we had a talk discussing why she felt the way she did. I\u2019m just trying to get her to regain her trust in me.", "So when I told her I was going she was aware that this friend was a girl, and she also knew that the movie was showing at 8. The movie tickets were also 6$ for both tickets. There was a promotion going on at the time. Sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear about that from the post. When it comes to communication this was the only time something like this happened. Yeah other times were always aware of what the others plans/ intentions are.", "Well she feels as if I put too much effort into my friendships and feels as if boundaries are being crossed. But when I ask her how she can\u2019t give me a straight answer. When it comes to some friends of mine I\u2019ve always kinda acted as the \u201ctherapist\u201d because I give good advice. Thought after our convo I feel like she might not like that I\u2019m always so willing to help. \nThis friend of mine doesn\u2019t not have feelings for me, in fact when me and her spoke it was really just about this guy that she likes but is giving her issues. She the type of person that would cut off a  friend if she feels like they\u2019d disrespect their own relationship. (Ive seen her do this). When I explained  that to my girl she couldn\u2019t care less. \n\nThe reason why I told her she couldn\u2019t hang out with her friend whom liked her was because we were speaking about boundaries so that this wouldn\u2019t happen again. And I told her that would be one of mine.", "Well yeah that\u2019s what I was thinking. And we\u2019ll this is the only time something like this has happened in our relationship. She\u2019s a wonderful person and I\u2019m willing to put the work in for this issue to be resolved. I was just wondering from others peoples perspective, how they view this situation.", "See that's not reasonable though because you didn't do anything to break trust. Shes punishing you for literally nothing, you didn't do anything wrong. Putting up with that sets a bad presidence for your relationship", "Alright not bad on those things. That was staying out a bit later than expected though. A text maybe next time. idk. Hanging on this for so long is a bit extreme. What's she want done about it at this point. She either needs to let it go or figure out what solution she wants.", "Okay, then NAH. You two had boundaries issues that you kept silent about, and are now expressing them. It sounds like this wasn't just about the movie, but the movie was the tipping point. \n\nFrom what you've said, it doesn't sound like she thinks you are crossing a boundary, she feels like your friends are crossing boundaries by asking too much time/effort from you.", "Well that\u2019s why I\u2019m a little confused cause I don\u2019t exactly know what to do for her to trust me again. And I don\u2019t want things to end just cause I decide to go out for a movie and she got upset. Even tho I don\u2019t fully understand why she doesn\u2019t trust me I also can\u2019t just dismiss her feelings you know.", "The thing is I was texting her while I was out from when I hopped  out the movie till when I called her when I got home. I  wanna know if there\u2019s anything else I could or done. I agree I was out pretty late but that wasn\u2019t necessarily my intention. I had to drop her back home after the movie and we spoke about some issues she was having with her mom.", "She told me she wants to know the people I hang out with. Which I have no problem with. She already know a lot of my friends. Just not the once\u2019s I don\u2019t keep close contact with from high school. Which I\u2019m actually making the effort for her to meet them.", "Well as much as I didn\u2019t like the idea of them 2 hanging out I trust her to make the right decision. So that\u2019s why I never said anything. Granted I brought it up because we were discussing things that we feel should be boundaries and I figured I should of said that. \n\nThe thing is she seems to think I spend all this time helping out my friends when In reality i get hit up by them every blue moon. If they are struggling with something It\u2019s in my character to help them out with it. (Guy or girl). A lot of my time is actually just spent working/ spending time with her. I don\u2019t really see my friends all too often. \n\nAlthough I don\u2019t feel like I put a TON of time towards my friends. Is it right for me to dismiss their issues because my girlfriend feels like I spend too much time on it?", "Honestly it sounds like you did a lot of things right and really don't have much to be sorry for. Went later than expected but you still checked in throughout. NTA really if that's all the case.", "Reasonable both ways to know who yall are spending time with. I don't think \\*I\\* would need to have met them all in person but know of them ahead of time is good. She needs to find a way to let it go though for real if you are making an effort on your part.", "In that case, she sounds a bit possessive and controlling. Especially since, in this instance, you only got to hang out with your friend because she was already hanging out with hers and you weren't invited. Might be time to re-evaluate this relationship.", "Thanks I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only ones who thinks that I made the effort to do everything right despite the situation", "I agree which is why Ofc she won\u2019t be able to meet them all in person. Tbh there\u2019s not many that she hasn\u2019t met or heard about. I\u2019m just hoping that she sees I\u2019m making an effort"]}
