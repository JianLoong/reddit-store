You're dealing with a traumatised kid who you clearly don't like and you expect him to behave like a non-traumatised angel? You and your parents are really going to screw up this kid.\n\nFoster care? Yea he probably would be better off, might find some people who actually want what's best for him. Military school??!!! Wtf!!", "Maybe he is testing to see if you are committed to him. When the going gets tough, you abandon him again. Double down on therapy. If you refuse to deal with him, and that you only loved his mom, I guess foster care is it. Sad.", "OMG, this poor kid!  He knows you never wanted him to the point that you signed away your rights.  He lost the only real parent he ever knew as a child.  He then ended up with your parents, who didn't want him once the going got tough, and he then ended up with you, who he knows didn't want him even when things were good.  He's been through nothing but abandonment and loss and he's only 14 years old.  \n\nI honestly don't know what the answer is here, except I feel for this kid who likely feels unwanted and all alone in the world.  Although you do say you loved his mom, nowhere in this post do you say you love your son.  Is that an oversight on your part or is that how you feel?\n\nYour son never had a choice in any of this.  He didn't ask to be born.  He didn't ask to have the only parent who wanted him die.  Teenagers can be pretty shitty at times even when they aren't dealing with massive abandonment and trauma... but usually parents are pretty committed to them being part of the family even when they screw up royally.  You were NEVER committed even when he was an infant, so obviously you want to walk away when the going gets tough, but it definitely makes YTA to try to do so.", "Before my judgement, I would suggest that you change therapists, and both get individual counseling as well as joint counseling. You need a therapist that specializes in trauma. You might have a competent therapist right now, but if they don't understand his CPTSD, then things won't get better.\n\nNow, onto you. You had the right to not want kids, and were responsible enough to send financial support. You also took on your son to keep your parents from damaging him with military school the way it damaged you. I think your therapist has not helped you with your communication skills, as you escalated the conversation to the point where he is acting out by trashing the place. Having an honest conversation without anger, expressing that you two are still getting to know each other and both loved his mother, and you would like to help now, despite not being there before. You need to get over your resentment of his existence. He will be 18 in 4 years, and you can do a lot to help him in those 4 years. I get that you never wanted him, but please stop resenting him for existing.\n\nIf he asks why you didn't love him or weren't a father, tell him that it wasn't about him, but about yourself and what you wanted in your life, but you now want to know him and going forward can build a relationship. It will be a difficult conversation, but that you each have to give each other a chance. Explain to him the hard no's you have - trashing the place, not doing schoolwork, not doing chores. Find out what his hard no's are, so he feels like he has some control over his life, which he clearly feels he doesn't.\n\nLastly, you two must have something in common. Find out what it is and make it a standard activity. I think there are a lot of well-intentioned people here, so NAH, but you would be the AH if you don't stop and change things going forward.", "INFO: What do you mean by trashing your house? Purposely breaking expensive items, breaking things when upset, throwing crazy parties, and being clumsy and inconsiderate are all very different and warrant different responses. To what extent is he not cleaning up after himself? A lot of teenagers are messy, so this might not be unreasonable. And can you elaborate on his school situation? Lots of kids, especially kids who have chaotic home lives, struggle with school. If he's unmotivated and failing all his classes, that's kind of to be expected.", "Everyone has failed this child. Instead of threatening him, did you consider getting him some help? He\u2019s dealing with grief and loss. He also knows that you don\u2019t want him.

I\u2019m human and made a mistake, no need to dog pile it\u2019s not productive. I stand by my original statement, this child has been failed. 6 months of therapy is not a long time. Op, doesn\u2019t want this child and the boy knows it. Sending the child away shouldn\u2019t even be an option. This kid has to feel like nobody wants him, it\u2019s really a sad situation.", "Maybe he's a dick because he found out at a young age his dad didn't want anything to do with him? Then his mum died? Then his dad who doesn't want him talks about socialising him like he's a dog?\n\nIn so many ways, this is your responsibility.\n\nYou already know the answer to whether or not YTA. My opinion certainly makes no odds.", "Do people without parental rights pay child support?", "NAH. The circumstances are the suckiest for everybody involved but I can't assign blame.

The poor kid doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go. But at the same time, the kid is also old enough to face consequences. Trashing your house is not typical teenage behavior. Not doing homework, being moody or being a slob would still be acceptable teenage behavior, especially after the death of his mother. But trauma and abandonment doesn\u2019t give him leeway to trash property and expect to not face any consequences. \n\nYou never wanted him. But you\u2019re still feeding and housing him.

He believes that there is no one in the world who wants him, and also that no one has the right to parent him. \n\nYou need to address each of these issues separately. The second one is actually the easiest. He's under your care, you agreed to take him in, and that means you're going to fulfill the role of a parent. That means there are going to be rules, there are going to be consequences, there are going to be expectations. You can understand and respect that he's going through the worst possible scenario right now, but that is **not** a blank slate on his behavior. I recommend heading over to the parenting subs to get some advice and suggestions. \n\nThe first issue of him not feeling wanted...that should probably be dealt with in family therapy.

It sounds like he's difficult and destructive but I don't really blame him.

If you are going to attempt to be some kind of parent/guardian/caregiver to this kid, you're going to have to find your own style. You mentioned your ex was lenient and that your parents are structured. You need to find a style that is cohesive to you and Danny, whether that's treating him like a friend or what have you. Kids always find out the truth, he obviously knows you didn't want to have him and he has some deep wounds from being a traumatized kid. So go from what he already knows and work yourselves into a cooperative space. Tell him everything honestly, you didn't want kids so tell him why, you signed away your rights so tell him why, you are trying to parent him so tell him why. Honesty goes a really long way with kids that are struggling. Ask him what he needs, what he thinks will help and if ultimately you can't get anything from him and can't see a way out after GENUINELY trying to, military school it is.

Against the grain, I know, but a lot of the things other people are saying, I just don't read the same. \n\nThey complain about you calling him a dick and such, but I'm not reading it as an outright derogatory statement.

Teens can absolutely be dicks. They can be a pain in the ass. It's part of growing up. \n\nSaying that doesn't make you a bad person. I wouldn't suggest saying it to his face right now, your relationship isn't there yet, but I've known some families where they are on that level. \n\nPeople are pointing out that he's been traumatized and the abandonment issue - these are all true, but as you've stated, you're not his legal guardian even now. Your parents still are, he's just living with you. It sucks that they had to give up, but you mention they're 'old af'. They could be having health issues you didn't tell us for whatever reason, or just not have the patience to deal with him and don't want to make things worse. \n\nIf you cannot find an equilibrium with him, there's a good chance that the decisions will be made for you. He's acting out so strongly at home and not doing his school work, which means he's falling behind, and if he starts acting out in school, it could very well come down to both you and your parents being declared unfit. \n\nAnd in a way you are, but that's because you didn't want this and never prepared. You're trying your best right now and getting frustrated and lashing out yourself. \n\nI think there's some gems of good advice to be found even in the worst comments here.

My parents divorced when I was in 5th grade and yeah they both wanted me and stuff but it wasn't until my mom passed and dad helped me with her funeral that I knew he was still in love with her). Bond over that mutual love, when he's ready. Talk to him about what she was like when you were both together and let him see her through your stories. \n\nAsk him if there's any outlets for his anger he wants to participate in that he hasn't been able to since she passed, or he would like to try. \n\nYou can make this work, but I don't think you're an asshole for being overwhelmed and thinking drastically right now.", "Nta but I don't know how he'll turn out.

I get it. I'm  CF. But you created one anyway, and shirked parenting responsibility while his mom was alive. Then she died and your parents stepped up and you shirked responsibility again. You got 14 years of freedom from the responsibility of *your own* child. And then you agreed to that responsibility, and are now threatening to get rid of the kid *after 6 months* because it's too hard. Because you don't want to face the direct result of your poor choices as his parent. \n\nTough tits. You accepted the responsibility, now actually live up to it. That's a full human being you're responsible for now. Grow up. It's more than time. You can do your best for 4 years.

The child was 12 when all this went down.  The child is acting out his frustrations now. The child needs intensive psychological help and he is getting some but it's clearly not enough or not frequent enough. The child is tearing things up and being aggressive in that manner.  OP does not know how to handle it.\n\nNo one is completely at fault here. Should the child be able to control himself? One would think so but we don't know the circumstances surrounding ex's death. Was it a car accident? A violent act? Illness? These things will affect the child and he has no one to really guide him as he processes these things. OP never wanted to be a parent and, to be fair, has no idea HOW to parent. OP's parents are, according to OP, older than dirt and probably not as able to handle the teenage years. None of this is anyone's fault. It's just life.  \n\nRegardless of all this, the child deserves a home and guidance through the teenage years. OP must find a way through this.

When your child, very predictably, misbehaved, your parents threatened to send him away, I.e. threatened to abandon him, to military school.  And then they did in fact send him away to live with you.  So they did abandon him.  Holy fucking shit, this kid needs more than six months of counselling to be okay.

And what incentives, if any, have you offered him in exchange for improving his behavior? Don't exercise the nuclear option of removing him from the home until you've exhausted all other possibilities.

Had you not taken him back, you would also be TA unfortunately. But after reading this post and a couple dozen comments, I think both you and him would have been better off with him going into foster care. And it really pains me to say that, because the foster system is not what is should be. \n\nUltimately YTA in just about every possible way this could have gone. But that doesn't mean I don't feel for you, or your kid. You guys were both dealt pretty shitty hands.

That's just rough all the way around.\n\nI wish you and your son the best of luck.", "YTA you need to sit down and lay it all out for this kid, explain why things are the way they were and why he's here now, let him know it's because you have feelings for him you took him in, be honest in telling him you didn't want a kid but you're now willing to give it a go, he needs to as well for it to work.

They f*ed up OP. They were involved in the kids life while it was comfortable for them. The kid is suffering and his grandparents are already proved they can't handle a teenager. So OP tried to step up but he wasn't a parent before and he is already damaged so he's trying to protect the kid from a certain fate but it's against his basic values and life choices.

They would likely push one of these people to stay the active guardian which would be a long, traumatic process. \n\nI don't imagine it's healthy for a 14 year old to have his legal guardian fighting and saying, \"no! >:( I don't want him! >:(\" \n\nRight now, the best thing for this child is the adults in his life to continue counseling and give him the stability he needs. He only has less than four years before he's an adult. They need to make this a better environment for him before he's an adult with a ton of trauma he has to work through likely on his own.", "Yeah, he's 14, his mom is dead, and is left with people who don't want him.\n\"He needs to be responsible for his actions\", no, he needs an adult that cares about him, and tries to understand why he's lashing out instead of threatening him with abandoning him. He's well aware no one wants him there, why would sending him away be a threat or be a surprise?\nOP also mentions he didn't want kids, but that he only got a vasectomy AFTER he had a kid. Now he's also blasting on the internet about how much he hates his son and doesn't want to deal with him.\n\nI really hope the kid finds an adult that will take care of him.", "Yeah, like father like son. How can he be here asking AITA while also calling the kid he abandoned a \"dick\" for lashing out?", "He needs a parent or he's fucked. We all know this right? All he's got is his sperm donor who's going to bail because \"his rights.\" The kid is doomed. That is on OP and his shit parents.", "> I never wanted kids. I met a woman who felt the same until we got pregnant.\n\nShe either:\n1) lied\n2) makes a significant *partnership* decisions unilaterally\n\nNeither of these bodes well for a \u201cwonderful, stable life\u201d.", "So many people talking about this child like they\u2019re an untrained dog you just take to the shelter when it acts up. And so many people who care more about OPs stuff than a fundamentally broken traumatised child.", "Cartman's mom certainly tried.", "You can absolutely blame a father not supporting his son.", "Amazing! I had no idea. That's so cool\n\nI can't imagine what it be would like to drink myself stupid at an unprotected sex orgy at 1 am at 14 because your parents can't stop a legal adult fully capable of understanding consequences on a long term basis \n\nDo they make kids different in your country? Different species there maybe? Brain scans don't apply to people if they move to central Europe then? Or do all the kids that didn't understand long term consequences just...die at 14/15 leading to a form of long term social darwinism?\n\nBecause I've met a lot of 14 year olds. Ran a few summer camps. I've been 14 myself actually. And I can say that hitting about 27 was literally life changing. At 14 I was attempting suicide and thinking about school violence and unable to manage my own emotions and couldn't understand most math (discalcula). And now I am actually a completely different person. Almost like you should be more mature at 27 than 14. Glad to hear you're still the same though\n\nI do have to ask though. Why haven't I heard of 14 year old politicians from Central Europe then? If you guys actually thought 14 was a legal or moral adult you'd have no real problem voting them in yes? After all they should be held to the exact same standard that adults are you just said so?", "I'm childless and I'm baffled by these comments.", "My heart is absolutely breaking for this poor child. The child didn\u2019t ask for this. He\u2019s the victim. Every comment talking about the child not taking responsibility for his actions\u2026. Hmmm where did he learn that? Maybe when his own father didn\u2019t take responsibility for impregnating his mom?", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Mom's dead. We have no idea if she trusted them with her child.", "Or changed her mind once she got pregnant. Holy shit, can people not have a change of heart depending on circumstances?", "3. decided to have a kid on her own.  Having a kid on your own is not equivalent to bringing the child into a shitty situation.", "He is not his father. Just a biological father, you know, like a sperm donor.", "Exactly \ud83d\udc4c", "And OP has only been a \"father\" to him for 6 bloody months!!!! So weird that the 14 yo boy w the dead mom who was tossed out of grandma and grandpa's \"perfectly curated\" (??) house isn't transformed into the perfect seen and not heard kid in 6 months!\nIs this post even real??", "Probably more than this kid and at least he has a parent willing to help him when the parent in all honesty and legally doesn't have to. You don't know my story, and I ain't about to tell it to internet stranger that doesn't matter.\n\nEither way this kid got told the cold hard truth, and either he makes a choice of being with people that are biologically his family, or face the foster system. Which isn't great.\n\nIf 14 year olds can be mature enough to work and get emancipated, then this kid can be told the cold hard facts about his life. It's not pretty but that's life.\n\nMany adults experience childhood trauma, an guess what turn into fully functioning adults. Unless you let it eat away you like certain people do and become a basket case at the drop of hat that's just life.", "The tone doesn't help, for sure. She wasn't an asshole, she simply decided that keeping the baby was worth losing OP when she got pregnant unexpectedly. She probably would have been happier if OP also changed his stance on kids, but she apparently accepted continuing as an single parent without him until she could meet someone. She wasn't planning on dying. She made the best choices she had.", "Let\u2019s recap: no biological family, no god parents, and no close friends with an interest in adopting the child. How exactly was the child going to be raised? Even if day-to-day life was okay, that\u2019s a far cry from stability.\n\nMom setup a situation where Danny\u2019s entire future was predicated on her continued health. That\u2019s shitty.", "Correct. Therapy helps you learn how to cope. It does not fool you into thinking the sky is green. This kid has been repeatedly abandoned. His path towards healing probably winds through self sufficiency and seeking out healing experiences, including with his therapist. \n\nBut he\u2019s going to have a very hard time pursuing healing while he\u2019s a minor in this situation. Nothing the therapist can do to help that.", "Can confirm,as a man with two absentee parents, it's not the birthing that makes you parents,we just put that on certificates to make bureaucracy easier,it's what comes after that makes you a parent", "Why don't you all get that he lost his only relative?? The only family he had ever known ?? That kid must be depressed and conflicted af, and honestly I'm glad that he isn't in drugs or self harming, cause a lot of kids in his position would do. I was devastated when my father died, and I was older than him.\nWhat would happen when he's 18? The same thing that's happening now: dad will tell him that he's somebody else's problem.\nRaising a kid doesn't end at 18, you don't stop being a parent when they reach 18. Most kids are barely out of high school at that time.\n\"Alienated the only people that wanted him\"? Who?? Who are you talking about? Both the grandparents and the father had made him very clear that they do not want him.\nHonestly OP should just let him decide if he wants to go on the foster system. It isn't worth the mental and emotional harm he's causing him, just because \"how mom would have hated that\".", "Most children's stability is based on their parents.  Any parental death, no matter how stable the family, is going to create instability.\n\nThere is no reason at all to think the family wasn't stable as it was, and there is no way to predict a young death like this.\n\nRidiculous to blame someone for dying.  Are *you* 14?", "honestly i don\u2019t think i could even blame the poor kid", "You can't control thoughts coming into your brain, or neurons firing as you say, but you can control what you do with those thoughts and how you respond to them to some extent, no? \n\nAgain I don't fully agree with how the commenter framed it, because this kid has been given a shit sandwich and acting out is a symptom of that, and he should be given a hearty helping of understanding, validation, and unconditional love while he's going through it (though of course he will never \"get over it\" entirely, I'd imagine). But to say he has NO control over his responses at 14 is just untrue, and dismisses the little agency he does have.", "Yes", "I'm beyond confused by the comments blaming the kid. If the kid wrote in, I'd advise him to work as hard as he can in school, look for other adults he can trust, and hang on. But he didn't write in. Dad did, and the only answer is YTA and you better step the eff up if you don't want your son to be an absolutely broken human. NO ONE LOVES THIS KID. He's FOURTEEN. What is he supposed to do??", "You can also have a 14 yr old who\u2019s had an incredibly easy life and many people who love them and still they lash out and make everyone\u2019s life difficult and actively ruin their own future. Ask me how I know.", "I think that having a child with someone who doesn't want them and be aware that this child Will have to deal with the rejection is as bad as not raising the child, that 't my opinion.\nI guess I understand OP's position because I'm a woman who doesn't want children and live in a country that If Ingot pregnant by acidente I wouldn't have the choice of having a abortion and would likely have the child but wouldn't be able to love them or b\u00ea a good parent.", "I don\u2019t blame her for dying, I blame her for not planning for her son\u2019s future. Take the religious aspect out of \u201cGod parents\u201d and you\u2019re left with a fundamentally good idea.\n\nRegardless, the situation was unstable *before* death, see also: \u201clenient\u201d parenting. A child of a foster system was desperate for love and didn\u2019t want to set boundaries. That\u2019s not on OP.\n\nOP wouldn\u2019t even be involved now if it weren\u2019t for the grandparents wanting a grandchild. If they see themselves that way, great. Time for them to step up the way they didn\u2019t with OP. Guilting OP into being involved is incredibly unfair.\n\nOP is a sperm donor, nothing more.", "You can use the word socializing to describe people.  I work with people and sometimes we work on getting them out and socializing more.", "I don't know what crowd you hang out to, but none of the adults I know threaten to hit people - you need better friends.", "Plenty of great, stable homes do not have a plan for a parent dying.  You're being ridiculous.  We can't always plan for everything.\n\nAs for \"lenient\", that's according to OP's estimation as compared to his own parents, whose parenting he did not appreciate.\n\nCompletely possible to have a loving, stable family where a tragedy happens and someone is in an unpreventable situation.  The world isn't the predictable thing you think it is."]}
