Because of this she constantly receives sweet compliments and unfortunately inappropriate ones too.\n\nToday she texted me at work asking if I could come comfort her as she was having a panic attack.

She filled her with the belief that everyone talks behind her back and tried to wrap it in a pretty deceitful bow claiming this was all because she\u2019s \u201clooking out for her.\u201d\n\nThis is one of multiple encounters she\u2019s had with people at our work sexualizing her, commenting on her body/appearance.

All of them still employed by the company, all of them still making inappropriate conversation surrounding her at work. \n\nI was fed up. I marched on over and called this specific woman out in-front of the other offenders. I told her I lost all respect for her and that I found her behavior inappropriate and way out of line. I let her know it\u2019s not her responsibility to comment on my friends work attire at all as she is not a manager and her clothing does not break company dress code. I reported this behavior to my manager as my friend would not have the courage to herself. \n\nIm disgusted and ready to quit and walk out with her. My boss and some of my other co workers are upset with me for causing a scene at work and say it wasn\u2019t my place to address the issue.

Your friend is lucky to have you in her life.", "NTA - people making inappropriate comments and using insults to create a hostile work environment are exposing the company to risk of a lawsuit.

It doesn't matter if they are upset with you because you have made it clear that their comments and behaviour are wrong and will not be tolerated. Your boss should be concerned about a sexual harassment suit as he has done nothing to shut it down. You did the right thing by making a scene as no one can claim they didn't know about it. Continue to call out every remark that crosses the line. Your co-worker will be grateful to you forever and may find the courage to speak up herself.", "NTA, they clearly don't have an HR department so they can expect more scenes.

Large companies generally have procedures for handling this sort of thing and often prefer uninvolved people from taking things into their own hands.  On the other hand, small companies don\u2019t have that sort of infrastructure.  But Companies of any size there tend to not like to get sued so tend to have mechanisms to deal with these sorts of things, at least in the US.  Not saying they always work, though.", "NTA you did the right thing!", "NTA. Standing up to your friends is what you're supposed to do. You'd be the A, if you didn't, in fact.", "NTA \n\nThis is so out of hand and it\u2019s a management and HR ISSUE. No one has any respect because management doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Both of you need to find new jobs. You weren\u2019t wrong at all, I totally understand why you did what you did and don\u2019t blame you, but no job is worth this and you need to get your money from a company who cares about the people in its employ. This is just disgusting.", "NTA. At least someone there had the balls to be an adult. They don't deserve you.", "NTA. Tell them to address the issue next time so you won\u2019t have to.", "op=NTA\n\nYou sound like a good friend.

Sexual harassment is taken more seriously these days. I've been sexually harassed a lot in my life time I feel like that is common not saying it's right at all I hate it.\nBut now you can do something sue the hell out of the company because if she doesn't this will keep happening to others and these disgusting people will never be held accountable.", "NTA!!! As a HR Officer! I would have a field day with those individuals! Zero tolerance!", "NTA. Sounds like a hostile work environment. And by management not addressing the issues properly they are setting themselves up for a lawsuit.", "I don't know if OP is in the US, but it would seem like there is a hostile work environment lawsuit in the offing.  Make sure your friend documents **everything**, including the lack of appropriate response from management and HR.  \n\nOP is NTA, and maybe, just maybe, the offenders will get a clue and stop what they are doing, now that it has been brought front and center to everyone's attention.

Good for you for standing up to this bully/harasser and letting the other harassers know that you will put them on blast. \n\nYou\u2019re a strong person and a good coworker.", "NTA.  Tell your boss if they'd do their job you wouldn't have to.  (You should probably start looking for a job now though).", "The only reason I haven\u2019t escalated it is because we know HR won\u2019t do anything. We had a co worker years ago who was in a much worse sexual harassment case. It was escalated to HR and nothing was done. The offender remained employed until the pandemic when they were let go. Let go for COVID ofc not for the horrendous things that took place.\n\nI don\u2019t have permission to share her story so sorry for being vague on this past issue.", "I am concerned about being fired. I\u2019m looking for a new job now. :(", "I understand your reluctance to go to HR, but do so anyway. This will build a body of evidence so that if you/your friend/anyone else who is facing this abuse end up taking it further, all of this will be logged. \n\n\nYou and your friends should keep meticulous records also.", "Yeah nta but... time to accept that your company sucks and isn't going to change. Both of you should start brushing up resumes and focus on getting tf out of there."]}
