Your parents will be HORRIBLE house guests while your wife is at a very vulnerable stage, but you don\u2019t care.

Will you be around to parent your other children and support your wife with your new baby? Or will you be at work, leaving her to get on with it? Will you be off when YOU invited your parents to come so you can cater to your dad and clear up their messes, all while policing your mother so she doesn\u2019t bully or harass your freshly post partum wife, all while keeping the household going and caring for your older children?

Both sides can be understood. I would even say there is a bit from what he said positive behind him, which is his parents living away, not seeing him and kids much, not enough money for a hotel, and you and he agreeing to live close to your parents. I will even say that still is.\n\nBUT; with your additions; he is the asshole. The fact he posted this, where he knowingly knew you would see this to reply; only shows how much one he is. This screams the need to question his viability as a partner for this alone. It is one thing to ask what he did. But it is another one entirely to do so with a ID his wife, you; know and follow to see.\n\nIf he wants them to stay with you and him; he does need to make sure they have their own space. One way or another. Dismantling the nursery for them to visit is moronic. The shots are not as worrisome cause the actual dangers are not as high as it is being pushed. Risks are there, but the issue is not the shots. Its everything together. MIL being mean, FIL being demanding, In-laws not taking care of their own messes, husband being a \"liquid in a squeeze bottle for cleaning\" if you get the point. \n\nI am sorry you have to deal with this. I even removed my original comments after I scrolled down and seen your reply showing he did what he did.", "I was about to say OP is not TA but after reading this - it sounds like you're being more than reasonable.

Absolute worst part of pregnancy & childbirth for me with #1!", "It is! Very practical too. Their official job is to check on mom and babies health - which they do very thoroughly. But they also provide help with breastfeeding, keep an eye on the stress levels and help defuse problems. For example, my third baby didn't get enough milk because my milk did not really come in right away. My kraamzorg helped immensely by providing mental support and practical solutions.\n\nThey help to start the process of taking care of the baby and feeling a little less helpless at the start. \n\nBesides all that, they provide company. The first two births, my husband had to work again after three days. Very lonely, that.\n\nPlus a major extra, they also assist in cleaning, cooking, making sure visitors don't overstay their welcome. They are immeasurably helpful and amazing. And mostly paid for with health insurance.
