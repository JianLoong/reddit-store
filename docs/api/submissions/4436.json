Where are you going to even put the adult furniture (e.g., bed) that you have to set up for a guest room, once it is redone as a nursery?\n\nAnd what will you do if they decide on a second visit, in half a year or so, after you've moved the child into the nursery?

This isn't their first baby so they'll also have to contend with parenting another child at the same time. She also said \"they\" leave messes so saying MIL has to clean up after FIL is disingenuous, at best, since it sounds like she doesn't do that even in the best of times. If the parents want to visit, and despite everything, she says she does, then they either need to stay in a hotel or AirBnB or OP needs to finish the basement. As far as MIL being mean, I agree with you. Time to call out bad behavior on the spot. If OP wants to avoid the scenes that will ensue, he might want to strap on the 'ol toolbelt and get that basement finished.... pronto! At least if they have their own space, it sounds like the wife can deal with (read: overlook) the rest.", "the post literally says the baby is not born yet and the comment you are replying to (supposedly OP\u2019s wife) says the baby will be unvaccinated when ILs arrive. either you cannot read or you are being willfully ignorant for the sake of making your original argument seem less obtuse than it is", "so\u2026. you think it\u2019s bad for babies to be at the grocery store but it\u2019s fine for the in laws to travel and get up in an UNVACCINATED baby\u2019s space? op is TA and so are you. grow the hell up.", "Just literally made me laugh out loud!", "Take the compression stockings. For real. I didn't and called l&d in a panic the day after I got home because my feet were literally slapping against the floor from all the fluid.", "Dunno if someone already mentioned this, but if you have a girl they will have a mini period a few days to a week or so after the birth due to being cut off from your hormones. No one mentioned this to me and it freaked me out when it happened!", "The first time pooping after giving birth was possibly the most painful experience of my life. I've heard it's that bad whether you birth vaginally or C-section.", "Like she said. Isn't that black and white. We all know you redditors will jump the moment an inconvenience is brought onto you, but people actually try to deal with their issues.", "The problem is that they\u2019ll say yes to the unfinished basement and show up, then complain incessantly, and refuse to spend any time in the basement, so she won\u2019t actually get any privacy.", "No silly.  I said the MIL could take care of Pops.  If she didn't, if it was me, I'd tell him to get off his dead arse.", "I googled when baby's can fly.  I found an article that surprised me.  It says 4 to 6 weeks old.  Go figure.\n\nhttps://www.parents.com/baby/safety/qa-when-can-baby-fly/", "The post says the baby won't have all of its vaccinations.  What age is it appropriate to have out of town people visit?", "Oh gosh, thank you.  My birthday was yesterday and I'm 66 years old.  I hope to never grow up.  I don't think it's bad for babies to be at a grocery store, I think it's bad for newborns, like 3 days old.", "Yup agree. I wish someone suggested this to me after my first. Sorta figured it out after getting feed up with the pads shifting. As my husband always says. If it\u2019s stupid and it works, it\u2019s not stupid. Comfort and convenience should be prioritised!", "Wait, WHAT?!? I'm pregnant with a girl, I have cousins who had girls, no one has mentioned this!", "Except if MIL did then the wife would t be upset", "You\u2019re an absolute corncob.", "when the person who shoved it out of their hooha deems it appropriate and doesn\u2019t have to care for a grown ass man as if they are a second baby! empathy and common sense are lovely tools. if you\u2019re so insistent that FIL isn\u2019t a burden, please, by all means, welcome him into your home!", "And musical instruments. Kids love musical instruments, especially toy drums.", "This is hilarious but in the end it'd be the kids and mum who suffer... kids have to deal with in laws and useless father, mum has to put them together again.", "Thirding this. Also. You will never know how much you could love mesh hospital panties until you wear them.", "Huh?", "Hahahaa!!  Thank you so much!  I'm glad you've been entertained.", "She needs to learn to not be a doormat.  We can't be sure what she means by 'cater'.  If that's get me a beer and a sandwich, she needs to point to the kitchen.  Then tell him to clean up the mess.", "Kazooes.", "If MIL Waa actually cleaning up after her husband then OP's wife wouldn't be upset", "No. A post-partum mother needs rest and her house to be a safe space, not a battleground where she fights to get an adult to do the basics."]}
