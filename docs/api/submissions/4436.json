Where are you going to even put the adult furniture (e.g., bed) that you have to set up for a guest room, once it is redone as a nursery?\n\nAnd what will you do if they decide on a second visit, in half a year or so, after you've moved the child into the nursery?

That doesn't mean those visits will continue with a newborn. Also adding this much stress on his wife right after giving birth is a HUGE AH move, regardless of any other reasons.", "I highly recommend adult diapers! They make life so much easier when changing and if you have bladder control issues after the birth they work so much better then pads. They even made period underwear now but I would stick with adult diapers.", "Not talking about it is probably contributing to birth trauma women experience because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s supposed to happen! Let alone know enough to question a medical professional. \n\nI appreciate all the women on Reddit who have taught me more about my own body than doctors ever have!", "Keep us updated.", "The fact that he went over your head about it says a lot. Basically he's GOING to get his own way.", "Good. I still think no overnight company until the baby is 6 months, for your health and theirs.", "Can't forget the coffee to go with the donuts!", "They REALLY HELP. I fully cosign this. I had my last 15 months ago", "Noted! I'm sneeze peeing now, so I don't have high hopes for after \ud83d\ude02"]}
