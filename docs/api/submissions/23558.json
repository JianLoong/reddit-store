My sister and her husband are not the brightest people, much more physically labor people than understanding math. \n\nI tried to ask if that was a good idea but she basically said how hard could it be. So I started quizzing her and these were not hard question. For examples I asked what a verb was, name the planets, and a simple math problem ( literally asked her to do division).\n\nShe could only name a few planets and she gave the definition for an adjective not a verb. Also just completely wrong with the math. It was kinda sad. \n\nI told her the right answer and asked if she can\u2019t do it how will she teach the kid to read or any math. She called me a jerk and left to cry.\n\nHer husband is on my ass but my mom thinks it a blessing. AITA??

If not, that kid's being set up to fail, and no parent has the right to do that.\n\nI'm not saying that parents 'have' to be able to answer each and every one of those questions. But what clinches it for me is that the sister said \"how hard can it be?\", because that is just a terrible attitude to have, and a gross underestimation of reality, especially when your own knowledge is lacking so severely.", "NTA. I'm not in or from the US and in my country homeschooling is *illegal* unless there are medical reasons for it and the parent doing the teaching has to pass  several different tests, and the kids need to pass tests every year with the knowledge of that grade. \nThe US has the worst literacy in the western world partially due to honeschooling, and is the country with most registered cults in the western world for the same reason.

I am medically vulnerable and left the classroom mid Covid, before vaccine access. I also pulled my children out as well. We have been homeschooling since. However, I actually know HOW to teach and am licensed from birth (early childhood development) to 12th grade. I also know which subjects I\u2019m less qualified to teach and know to access resources and assessment tools to be sure that I\u2019m imparting those standards appropriately. When there is something I am not comfortable teaching, I know how to find someone to help. For example, my BIL is a pharmacist with a chemistry background. When my kids outgrow my chemistry education, I have someone to help. Even those of us who are actually qualified to homeschool cannot be expected to do it in a vacuum.

Any adult who can't do something as simple as define a verb has no right to be educating a child", "NTA. Homeschooling is a vehicle and a shield for neglect and abuse. It works out great for kids with genuinely invested and capable parents who aren\u2019t neglectful or abusive in other ways but it totally strips the safety nets provided by regular contact with unrelated adults at school for others and robs them of the chance at a decent education because their parents don\u2019t have the knowledge or resources and resort to sticking them in front of a computer to do some absolutely abortive fundamentalist religious claptrap of a curriculum. \n\nIf your sister is as lacking in knowledge as you say, then by all means, shame her out of educationally neglecting her children if that\u2019s what it takes to turn her off the idea. \n\nI don\u2019t know when society started to decide that a group of Facebook parents with no common sense between them could take over highly trained professional roles like teaching (the homeschool movement) and healthcare (anti-vax, stick some essential oils and half an onion on your child with measles), but fuck it\u2019s getting old watching children suffering the consequences for that level of arrogance and stupidity.", "NTA. There should be requirements of people who homeschool their kids", "NTA\n\nI agree with you 100%.\nI have a degree and 2 post grads.

She spent an incredibly amount of time and effort at it and had a lot of resources and a dedicated space to it. She did fully commit to it however as much as what I believe a paid teacher probably wound have. I used to love going to there house as a kid because of all the cool stuff they had. They also enrolled in school programs and did socialisation. She also was not too proud to admit either when 2/4 reached high school and either wanted/needed and she enrolled them partially and then fully in public high school. The older two she didn\u2019t need to but all kids have different needs and she could recognise that. They have all done super well for themselves as adults.", "NTA but I admit that I\u2019m biased against a lot of homeschooling. I think it takes the right kind of parent to do it right and well. Partially because of the parents knowledge but there\u2019s also a huge socialization aspect to it for me that the parent needs to subsidize in a lot of activities or else the children grow up kind of stunted. \n\nBut yeah, I think it was a hard truth you made her face.", "NTA. Children have rights that are frequently and flagrantly violated by the adults around them, and one of those is the right to a comprehensive, fact-based education.

No. Parental desires should not trump a child\u2019s right to an education.", "NTA. Schools teach kids how to socialise and interact with others.

Like a Sheldon Cooper or Matilda types. Regular kids need guidance. Gifted kids can handle a lot more independent work.

I was able to identify and remedy a lot of that by myself at that point, but that was as an adult, and I\u2019d gotten my basic math/reading in public school.

My parents worked all the time, so I really only got 2 hours a day with my mom where she could teach me things. Mainly I just had to read my books and watch YouTube videos to figure it out on my own. \n\nMy mom is not a genius, but she is very bright. She\u2019s been the lead surgical technician at her hospital for 15 years now, specializing in Neuro. Even she didn\u2019t know/understand the material. But what she did do was read over what I was going to be learning the next day during her breaks at work and at home, so if I had any questions she would know the answers. She essentially just re-taught herself the material as we were going along. \n\nIf there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. I mean, home schooling programs have the packets and books that you buy that have all of the information in them. You just, as a parent, have to care enough to be involved in your child\u2019s education. My home schooling didn\u2019t affect me at all. In fact, it placed me at two grades higher than what I should\u2019ve been when I went back to public school.

My husband and I are stuck between homeschooling or not currently because there was a recent private school shooting in our area. With how common they are now, it\u2019s just so nerve wrecking. Not saying this is her motivation, but I completely understand why parents would want to home school. It\u2019s not like how it was 20 years ago when it seemed like only weird and controlling parents were doing it. And now, with unlimited access to the outside world and information, there\u2019s not really a reason not to do it if you are able and willing. \n\nI do think you were being an ass, so my final judgement is YTA.

March 2020- end of the year he was in 4th grade. The school actually had a wonderful distance learning platform. The teachers prerecorded lessons and had interactive assignments that were fun and engaging. I worked with him one in one with those. When school started up again after the summer break, it changed to just watching the teacher live for 8 hours and he totally glazed over that. It was so very boring. \n\nHe already did not have comprehension skills. From an early age you could read him a story and ask a simple question about what he just read and he could not answer it. \n\nI pulled him out of school Nov 2020.

As a parent teacher  you don't just start talking to the kid..

It teaches a lot of important skills kids can't learn stuck at home, and this becomes apparent when homeschooled kids always tell you, they can spot another homeschooled kid from a mile away. They struggle to make friends into adulthood, struggle with relationships, struggle to manage time in real world settings (and not just in their home). They grow up and complain that they always felt left out, weird, never fit in anywhere.

There are much gentler ways to express your concerns.

You should apologize and express these concerns in a much nicer way. Honestly, when it comes down to it, they're not your children, so how she chooses to educate them is 0% your decision.*\n\n-----------------LONG VERSION EXPLANATION-----------------\nI can understand that you're concerned about the kids and worried about their education quality, regardless of what types of stigmas exist regarding homeschooling. It seems like youre asking your sister these things because youre trying to be honest and because you care. \n\nHowever, i know many well rounded adults that grew up homeschooled. A lot of homeschooling consists of workbooks that outline subjects for easy comprehension and, with today's technology, youtube and the internet are a homeschooling parent's best friend. This is partially because the kids can learn a lot from youtube (i.e. CrashCourse by the green bros, khan academy, etc.), but it is also because it makes it easy for adults to refresh their knowledge. \n\nYou dont have to be a genius to homeschool, you just have to have patience and self-motivation skills. I believe that it's actually been proven to be easier for homeschoolers to handle the self-motivation required for successfully completing college/university, than it is for public/private school kids. (i feel like i read a study about it somewhere and ive also spoken with at least 50 or 60 homeschoolers regularly throughout my life). \n\nThe indoctrination aspect that has been linked with homeschooling is not always the case and because it's been stigmatized so heavily in the past 20-30 years, it can raise concerns for people's extended families. Most of the homeschoolers that ive seen, who were indoctrinated in some way, were so sheltered from the real world that when they went out into the world as adults, they either went the entirely opposite direction of the way their parents wanted them to go, belief-wise and lifestyle-wise, or less frequently, there were a few that couldn't handle the temptations/struggles of the real world and ended up ruining their lives with drugs, alcohol, etc, or they ended up eith mental health issues stemming from a lack of social skills. \n\nHowever, regardless of these things, and regardless of your personal concerns, you've basically disrespected your sister and made her feel like an idiot who's incapable of helping her children. There are much gentler ways to express your concerns. Putting your sister down like that is not cool, you should be encouraging/supporting her if that's what she wants to do, because telling someone that you think they can do it gives them confidence to try it. Confidence goes a long way in helping people become successful. If it doesnt work out, or if her children reach a point where they need a more structured environment, there's always public school, but with the amount of resources available to aid homeschooling parents these days, theres not nearly as much of a learning curve. You should apologize and express your concerns more gently. Supporting her and offering to help her with homeschooling will go a lot farther than making her feel like she's incapable. \n\nSide note: most of the homeschoolers ive met, regardless of the way they turned out, had at least a year or two of college credits by the time they got their GEDs, because they learned self-motivation from a young age and had a more flexible school schedule so they were able to move through their studies faster and therefore had their homeschooling done by 16/17 years old with only 2/3 years of college left. Theres also something to be said for learning in an environment where the student to teacher ratio is like 1:2, versus public school where the ratio is usually at least 1:12 or 1:15.", "The only person I know who was home schooled was based in the US. She did exceptionally well and was taking university courses by the age of 15. I can't say her mother was particularly bright, but she was definitely diligent in ensuring her daughter followed the course structure.", "YTA because you were unnecessarily confrontational and made people feel stupid, not because you were wrong. You can\u2019t change people by proving that they were wrong or stupid.", "YTA. Sorry, homeschooling actually isn't that hard. It seems like you went out your way to insult your \"dumb\" sister and her husband. You made her cry and your response was \"lol she's such a dummy\". \n\nMost of us learned basic grammar in like 2nd grade. I'm in college now and I had to double check that I was correct on verbs vs adverbs considering it's been 20 years since I defined them instead of just using them. \n\nParents who homeschool get a curriculum usually based on their state education guidelines it's easy enough to brush up and teach yourself then teach your kid. Besides, since you're clearly the genius of the family and your sister is so inept, you could easily educate your nieces and nephews, right? \n\nWhy they'll be presumptuous, opinionated, offensive but properly educated know-it-alls, just like you, in no time!!\n\nGood luck with that.", "I wouldn't say YTA. Homeschooling is definitely different but in many aspects not \"worse\".  My state is actively trying to defend public school, and to add to that has one of the worst education systems in the country. I moved to this state from a better educated one. \n\n 70% of 3rd graders are well below reading level, the schools sent out a notice to parents saying they were aware of the bathrooms being used for drug use and sex and that it's an ongoing issue they seek to resolve (seriously). The local population you can tell didn't take their education seriously. We commonly make jokes about schools just putting out factory workers (manufacturing hub all around us). \n\nWe decided to homeschool our 2 kids. The one just starting pre-k the other in 4th. The pre-k one finished his entire school year in 3 months, and begs to do more. He has already passed the requirements needed for kindergarten and is working on 1st grade now .... he's 5.\n\nThe 4th grader was behind on almost every subject as he likes being the class clown. As of now he is on par or ahead in every subject. We had it set up where he repeats every lesson less than a C grade, and after 2 tries it locks him out and reports it to us. He hasn't been using the retries and almost made perfect grades without the distractions a typical classroom has. \n\nAdmittedly this has taken a hit to both of their social lives. But in that regard we have met up with parents who have kids the same age, and are setting up play dates as well as field trips. Some parents around here homeschool because they want to control education, id fit in there. I want my kids to learn about slavery, the holocaust, and the trail of tears. I want them to learn in greater detail and not just glance over it. \n\nIs it perfect? Absolutely not. But are public schools perfect? Absolutely not. Where me and my wife fall short we can find tutors and programs to make up for it.  It's an extremely nuanced topic with both having many pros and cons, which are different for every family. However stupid parents can still homeschool, they just need to find proper programs and maybe tutors for help along the way.", "YTA. I was homeschooled and there are programs out there where you can buy DVDs that have different curriculums on them to do the actual \"teaching\" if your education isn't enough to teach them yourself. People really need to educate themselves on the world of homeschooling because the amount of commenters that think \"stupid people homeschooling is neglectful\" is just sad and ridiculous. You need to apologize to your sister for acting rude about her just wanting the best for HER child. Again, YTA.", "YTA.

There are plenty of great resources, enrichment coops, and programs for homeschooling.

I agree it\u2019s a terrible way to school myself having been through a fair amount of homeschooling. But you were cruel and unreasonably mean in your methods to tell her that. There was a more constructive, less hurtful way to advise her not to homeschool.  Do you think she\u2019s more or less likely to homeschool now that you\u2019ve made her cry? How about a civil conversation? Why jump to insulting her intelligence?", ">  I am going to get it out of the way and say I don\u2019t like homeschooling. I thinks it is almost impossible to do correctly on social and educational development. This is coming from someone that went to a shitty public school.   \n    \nYTA, right of the bat you went into this with a chip on your shoulder, and from that point on, you wanted to prove your point, to the point you would bully your sister about something that does not effect you.   \n    \n>  My sister and her husband are not the brightest people, much more physically labor people than understanding math.   \n    \nAnd this would make you an AH x 2, which means double the AH in case you can't do the math too.    \n    \nNot only do you have a chip on your shoulder, you demean and belittle your sister.  Put your ego in check, and instead of attacking your sister, help her.  Homeschooling is no better or worse than any other educational environment, you get out of it what you put into it, and that includes social development.  It can be much better, and it can be much worse than a public school.", "If she continues along the path, give her links to Khan Academy, and she can learn along with them.", "YTA. Yes she is probably not very bright, but its not like anyone learns anything in school either. School was designed as a babysitting center for factory workers, to produce the next generations of factory workers. The model is *at least* a century out of date and no longer serves any purpose.", "YTA. Your argument against her knowing these things isn't exactly a screaming recommendation for the local school systems, assuming that she went through it herself.\n\nLots of people only homeschool for the younger grades, or use supplementary classes for the older grades when some things are more complex. You don't have to actually know everything though, that's what curriculum and materials are for. Every (secular) homeschooled kid I know is ahead of their peers socially and educationally. \n\nQuite honestly, as someone who is not from the USA, I don't know how anyone could send their kids to school if they have a choice. It sounds awful and traumatic, for kids and parents. Learning is not optimal under the current circumstances, and depending on the state, the educational quality can be pretty awful too.", "Going against the grain with a YTA for a few reasons\n\nFirst, I want to clarify some misconceptions about homeschooling. I'm a former public school teacher and I currently create online curricula for students who are homeschooling. 100% of the content in our program is designed and created by credentialed teachers but completed at home. This is becoming a lot more common, so it's important to understand that homeschooling does not necessarily mean parents are the instructors. Even if they said they are going to teach her, it's extremely unlikely that they will be doing the actual instruction and will instead be using resources that are designed for homeschooling and provide parents with additional resources.\n\nSecond, I taught with a lot of really stupid teachers. Teachers who also probably couldn't name the planets or define a verb. I was shocked when I first started teaching just how dumb a lot of teachers are, especially those who have been teaching for decades and solely rely on textbooks and worksheets to provide instruction. Obviously there are a lot of brilliant teachers out there, but my God some of them lack common sense and basic knowledge on a level that is shocking.\n\nThird, I used to be very against homeschooling (again, former public school teacher) but have recently changed my mind. Especially since the pandemic I now have serious reservations about sending my own future kids to a public school. The lack of funding, safety, politicization of curriculum, lack of quality educators, and incompetent leadership cannot be understated. \n\nFourth, historically speaking, the majority of students who were homeschooling for religious reasons (so that their parents could restrict and control access to information, including not teaching evolution and things like that). However, that's changing. Many students are switching to homeschooling because they cannot access support for disabilities at their schools and for the reasons I mentioned above. Some also can work at a faster pace or enroll simultaneously in college or other online classes that are specific to their needs and interests. Some just learn better when they aren't in a classroom surrounded by distractions. Some have medical issues that cause chronic absenteeism and need greater flexibility. Consequently, more companies have started developing secular homeschooling curricula and offering online homeschool instruction.\n\nThe point is that homeschooling gets a bad rap, and while there are certainly some HUGE problems, it's more nuanced and not as black and white as people make it out to be. It has also changed significantly in the past few years in response to the pandemic and the crisis in education. \n\nWithout knowing more about your in-laws' circumstances or their reasons for homeschooling, I don't think it's fair to pass judgement on them. However, the way you went about communication your concerns was really rude and does make you seem like an ass. There's a way to communicate your concerns without trying to embarass them, and ultimately it's their decision and not yours. If anything, OP may have just alienated them and not made any impact on their decision.", "NTA and I say that as a homeschooler who used to teach in public schools. There are many reasons why someone would choose to homeschool their children. Mine have special needs (older son is autistic but is also gifted and younger son has dyslexia). That\u2019s why we started homeschooling our children. It isn\u2019t the same as it used to be and there are many social activities, group classes, and a growing number of secular homeschoolers. At this point, my kids have the option to go to public school but don\u2019t want to, despite having a lot of public school friends because it cuts into their time with their hobbies after their school work is done and they like the group and lab classes that they have right now. That said, homeschooling isn\u2019t for every family and I\u2019d go as far as as saying that it isn\u2019t for most families for various reasons. It requires a specific temperament for parents and children, time and financial resources, and baseline knowledge levels. Your children can learn things that you don\u2019t know via tutoring, online, or co-op classes, or dual enrollment. My oldest son has done that with calculus and physics and my younger one with Spanish. I myself am not great at math and tap out after college algebra or high school trigonometry. It also requires training on how to teach someone to read. There are books and materials written for homeschoolers that can help you learn this skill, but it can be very difficult. The skill set required for homeschooling is different from the one for parenting and if you don\u2019t create boundaries can cause damage to the parent child relationship. Homeschooling can be wonderful and there are people who for one reason or another aren\u2019t college educated but are successful at homeschooling. My husband is one of them. He\u2019s in the trades and taught our older son Precalculus. However, your sister doesn\u2019t seem equipped for the knowledge base and the toll that homeschooling can take on a person. It sounds like you may have saved them all some grief or at the very least pointed out deficiencies that need fixing before they start teaching.", "NTA. Most people have no business trying to homeschool their kids, because they simply don't understand the subjects well enough.\n\nA \"C\" student isn't going to deliver \"A\" level knowledge 99.99% of the time, meaning they're setting up the person they are teach for failure.", "NTA\n\n#HOMESCHOOL = ABUSE", "Oh so you showed your superior public school knowledge in an attempt to shame your sister into doing what you want her to do!  Aren't you clever?!?\n\nYou are an AH.\n\nMy DIL and her siblings were homeschooled.  One has a Masters in Communications and Marketing, one is a nurse, and one is an It specialist.  And they are all pretty danged smart.\n\nStates have minimum educational requirements by grades that homeschooled students have to meet.  They have regular standardized testing requirements that students must pass.  Homeschool coops have popped up in recent years to allow homeschool parents to share educational materials and resources to ensure kids are getting the necessary education.  In these coops, there are \"teachers\" who are SME's (subject matter experts).  My DIL's sophomore science teacher was an actual nuclear scientist, her electrician father taught shop classes, her math teacher was a retired math professor from MIT.  The only thing she felt she lacked was she never got to play an instrument (she plays piano).  She always wondered what \"band\" would be like.\n\nSo contrary to the perception, homeschooled kids are not pulled out of public school to become uneducated, religiously indoctrinated idiots.  Most are better educated than their public school counterparts.  \n\nAs a scholarship coordinator at a large university, I could always tell when an applicant was homeschooled versus public schooled.  Their writing tended to be better - grammar was correct and ideas articulated clearly and succinctly.\n\nSo stop drinking the kool-aid.  You aren't as smart as you think AND these are not your kids.  Your opinion doesn't matter here.  If you were a mature adult, you would be supporting your sister and helping her look into resources to educate her children in the best way possible, not trying to prove something stupid about your education.

I know a woman who is an evangelical Christian, and she decided she was going to home school her two kids, one of whom was special needs, along with the kids of some of their other church members.

Too many people think teaching is easy. People think, \"Those who can do, those who can't teach,\" and think teaching is so easy it's a joke. It is not. Teaching requires not just knowledge of the subject you're teaching, but knowledge of how to teach. And not every child learns the same way, so you have to know multiple ways to teach. And if you're trying to home school, it means you have to teach everything, not just one subject. It's a big ask for even a highly qualified and experienced teacher. For the average person? No. Just no. The reality is, most people in the US today who are pushing homeschooling are evangelical Christians who want to isolate their children from the secular world.

Hopefully most of the rest just didn't start homeschooling until later in their school career... well, maybe not, since Table 9 beaks that down further and reports that only 83 and 92%, respectively, of K-2 are learning those things.

Your sister deserved the reality chick. #respect-teachers!", "I have a master\u2019s degree in education, I\u2019ve been teaching for several years, and I would never consider homeschooling a kid. Here are a variety of reasons:\n\n1) No matter how well-educated I am, I cannot make up for the collective knowledge of the dozens of educators a kid would typically encounter throughout a standard education, even after accounting for some of them being potentially incompetent.\n\n2) It is important for children to be introduced to a variety of perspectives on different issues so they can synthesize all of that into their own unique perspective. They need to learn how to be challenged by different viewpoints, how to compromise with others, how to argue for their ideals, etc. They shouldn\u2019t just be indoctrinated into what I or any individual believes. They shouldn\u2019t be kept in a bubble where nobody ever challenges how they\u2019ve been taught to view the world. Plus too many parents intentionally use this as an opportunity to indoctrinate their children into their own narrow-minded beliefs.\n\n3) Even if you connect with other families who are homeschooling their kids, you simply won\u2019t be able to recreate the social experience that comes with schooling. Does this come with it\u2019s fair share of negative experiences? Absolutely, but learning how to function in a community that consists both of people you like and people you don\u2019t is part of learning how to be a member of society. I would go as far as to argue that the social elements to school are even more important than the academic elements (though the academics are obviously still incredibly important, more so than many people seem to give them credit for).\n\n4) Getting a good job is way more about the connections you have than your skillset (though both are obviously important). Good educational institutions can help build these connections, and institutions of higher learning, trade schools, and jobs are all going to value you coming from an actual school over having been homeschooled. That\u2019s just reality and it\u2019s why rich people send their kids to nice private schools: not only for the better learning opportunities and resources, but because those schools are more likely to help foster the connections those kids will need to secure a lucrative future.\n\nWhenever I try to discuss this type of stuff with people, I do always start with acknowledging that education systems are often problematic and leave much to be desired, as a teacher myself I have plenty of critiques of the institutional context within which I work, but even with all the bad aspects of it it is still leagues above the best homeschooling any individual or even network of parents are capable of. Teaching is an incredibly challenging job that requires continued education. You can never truly master it and must always be committed to growing and adapting to ever-changing social conditions and research into best practices. Even if someone cares enough to commit fully to this, they are not capable by themselves of being responsible for the entire education of a single human being. It is not fair to the kids for parents to take away real educational and social opportunities from their children.\n\nIn this case, these parents seem like they\u2019re not even intelligent enough to pass through a bad public elementary school, let alone teach at one.

They have teachers rely on state standards and textbooks to decide what and how to teach. Plus, many states require students that are homeschooled (especially past grade 6) to go through districts where families are provided with materials and students check in with teachers once or twice a week.\n\nAlso, those talking about indoctrination, what do you think most current education systems do? They were literally designed to teach children how to be good employees. Students in the U.S. are forced to spend years learning things that aren't useful or helpful in everyday life or the careers they choose. Not to mention, incredibly important information about how to operate in society is left out. \n\nLastly, if you are in the U.S. schools are ridiculously dangerous right now.

Even if they aren\u2019t well versed in math, or whatever, if they have access to the internet, there are plenty of homeschooling programs & tools available to parents going this route. Of course, it does mean the parents do actually need to be able to provide the means for their kids to access the info they need. Not ALL homeschooling families are religious \u201cfanatics\u201d. Unfortunately, those are the ones that are prevalent in the public eye as the public is more interested in hearing about the homeschooled kids whose parents failed them. \nNot knowing OPs sis & hubby, can\u2019t say which type they\u2019d end up being but the way OP berated & belittled the sister was nasty. It\u2019s ok to be worried about her kids, but it would\u2019ve been more productive to present concerns in a nicer manner. Instead of belittling & bullying Sis over her own lack of some basics, OP should\u2019ve been asking such questions as to how, or what, her plans were for obtaining the needed info for helping her teach her kids such things. Instead of making her feel stupid, it could open her eyes to the work it would entail and she could then figure out if the idea wouldn\u2019t work out in the long run. However, if after hearing about it & even asking herself how she\u2019d be going about her plans, she n her hubby come up with a working game plan after researching the tools needed to make homeschooling a success. Heck, my daughter has taught herself a whole lot of life skills that are helping her succeed from doing her own researching than her public school ever gave her. \nAnd homeschooling can mean lots of different methods. Doing curriculum based classes online, enrolling in an actual online school that they \u201cattend from home\u201d.  And a lot of homeschoolers are better equipped due to them learning what works best for them when obtaining the skills needed, they often learn how better to manage their time when it comes to working, how to research things. There are a lot of Colleges that have started to seek out homeschooled kids of these types as they are better prepared to tackle the challenges that college entails than most kids coming in from public schools due to them having learned to self discipline themselves on studying & such.\nBoth types of schooling can work, some kids thrive better in one environment over the other, some don\u2019t do well in either one and some excel regardless of how bad their \u201cschooling\u201d experience was. \nIF OP had just pointed out concerns & started Sis into thinking & looking into what they\u2019d be signing up for if the went the homeschool route instead of belittling her & making her cry, my vote would\u2019ve been different.", "There are good, comprehensive homeschooling kits that cover all subjects as well as providing the appropriate materials for parents so that they can teach the material without being overly familiar with it.\n\nThere are also some great online options for homeschooling so that the kids are interacting with people (other children and teachers) in an online setting. AND since homeschooling is becoming more and more popular, there are all kinds of coops, parks & rec programs, and homeschooling extention programs out there for kids to get the social interaction they need.\n\nAll that being said, I homeschooled my kids for all of one year. They did great, but in person learning is definitely better for them and me.\n\nNow, YTA simply because you are so judgmental. Did you ask if she had done her research? Had a plan in place? Maybe she found a program that is going to be great?! Not all homeschooling is for the ultra religious or the crazy flakes. It can be a great experience if done right, and you don't have to be super intelligent to ensure your child gets a good education.", "Homeschooling with a good program can be very beneficial for children, especially if they have needs that aren't being met in the public school system. However, when a homeschooling program insists that humans and dinosaurs cohabited the planet, and the planet is 6,000 year old then we have a huge issue. A lot of speculation can be made about what type of curriculum your niece/nephew would be exposed to, so I will address two very broad groupings.\n\nWith a solid homeschooling education, let's call ot Plan A, there is a community effort within the program to give each other help and guidance with their weaknesses and then helping others with the areas they are stronger. For instance: SIL isn't strong in Maths, but one of the other parents is, so that parent takes over any math issues. Meanwhile, the parent strong in math has a weak understanding of history, but SIL is a big history buff so she takes the history portion. Yes, I know, SIL is not a history buff - work with me here. This is how it's supposed to go, with get togethers for socialization and even sports teams, etc.\n\nLet's call the next broad grouping Plan B. This is where the parent signs up their child for the most basic of experience, sits them in front of the computer and says, \"do it!\" No guidence, no supervision, no socialization. Unfortunately, we are living with the results of this process right now due to the pandemic as many parents were not held accountable when their child did not log in to school, therefore the child fell behind. This, of course, does not take into account homelessness, extreme poverty, etc. This is also where those who would rather have a more compliant audience steps in and cause havoc.\n\nI get the impression that SIL was expecting the computer to teach her child and she could sit back and relax. That's not the case and I'm glad you said something. However, the way you did it may bave been a bit too harsh. Then again, she may be one who doesn't get the hint until hit over the head with a baseball bat. I'm not judging, I have moments like that at times.\n\nBecause you admitted your bias against homeschooling, your mother's agreement and relief, and the obvious concern you have for your nibbling, I deem you...NTA. But may I make a suggestion? Spend more time with your nibbling at the museum, zoo, whatevers to help broaden their horizons, because it sounds like they'll only get to do such things if their school takes them.", "Wow such hatred for homeschooling. I grew up homeschooled my entire life, I was gifted and placed highly in standardized testing and IQ tests, got partial scholarships for several prestigious private schools in my area but my parents just couldn\u2019t afford it, ended up starting community college at 15 and I did just fine. I\u2019m now a chef for a really nice restaurant, make good money and consider myself fairly well educated.\nI will say I saw my fair share of parents \u201cunschooling\u201d, using homeschooling as a way to just teach religion or keep them only learning certain things about the word. But those people were not as common as parents just wanting more opportunities for their kids who were gifted/smarter than their grade level.\nI will say, at some points, I wish I had gone to public school, the criticism and bullying I received for being the smart homeschooled kid still hurts me to this day. Now I have a wicked smart 8 year old and I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t put him through homeschooling. I wanted to give him a normal school life. That was, until, teachers weren\u2019t challenging his reading, math and science level, and our schools are threatened heavily by shooters. Now my mom and I homeschool him the basics to our ability, guide him etc and he takes all other classes online and is held to the standardized public school testing. He does sports throughout the year and has tons of social groups through the library and friends he sees in a regular basis.\nNot all homeschoolers are bad.", "it isnt impossible to do correctly \nit takes time and effort and using resources and \n\ndoing lots of group activities out of the home and in - \nand realistically you do not need to know everything just be willing to research and learn and \nfrankly you could learn some social skills and put some of your snobbery to the side - that certain classes of people can't understand math.  you sound unpleasant and like a bully and maybe that's who she is trying to avoid for her kids .... there are lots of ways to be kind and supportive amd involved in your niblings education and being rude and mean is not only not necessary - its relationship damaging and not effective. \n\nYTA", "YTA for basically confessing you did this bc you are biased against homeschooling.    \n\n\nA homeschooling parent doesn't need to be able to quote everything in the syllabus from memory, they just need to learn it before teaching that module.  Also homeschooling being the domain of the religious fundamentalists and crazy separatists is a bit dated.  Nowadays lots of parents homeschool for many reasons.   We have a son who was immuno-compromised and basically spent all his time in daycare being sick.  That's what lead us to homeschooling.  \n\n\nSending your kids to a brick and mortar school is 20th century thinking.  In the modern information age, a kid has tons of resources online to complete their education.  Going to a building at the same time every day was useful when training kids to be factory workers.  Now we often work from home in our profession so  why not educate at home too?  \n\n\nAlso socializing is a bit overstated.  Homeschooled kids often excel at socialization as very few times in ones life will you be working strictly with folks the same age as you (such as in a classroom).   Some of the socializing that is missed from homeschooling is actually an addition by subtraction sort of thing.   There are people in one's community they would normally not be close to for many reasons, when you send your kid to school with those people's child, you are subjecting your kid to that.  Homeschooling kids are often a bit emotionally healthier as they are subjected to the bullying from kids who come from toxic and violent homes.", "YTA.  Going out on a limb here considering most of the top responses, and also because I am generally opposed to home schooling on principle that it undermines public education and is therefore bad for society overall, even if it's good for *some* kids.  But, just because your sister couldn't answer a few random pop quiz questions that you didn't give her a chance to study or prepare for, doesn't mean she will necessarily do a bad job.  Surprise random quiz questions are not a good way to measure intelligence, let alone educational planning potential.  If she is motivated to work hard at it, and depending on the kid's age and interests, she might be able to pull it off, if equipped with the right resources and information and support network.  On average, home schooled kids do a bit better than public school kids academically.  Of course, it's possible your sister might be in the below average competence group, but without knowing more about her than you provide in your condescending assessment of her as a 'physical labor person' as opposed to a 'bright' person (as though people who do physical work cannot also be intelligent?) it's hard to say.  Do you think she would agree with your assessment, or might she think you have some kind of biased attitude you're displaying here in your one-sided story?  Whether you're right or wrong about her, you clearly don't think very highly of your sister and it might just be tough having a sibling with that attitude, always looking for ways to humiliate you.

Hopefully one day you\u2019ll be able to tell your nieces/nephews how you saved them from being homeschooled.", "I'll get downvoted for this, but I think YTA. There are excellent homeschooling curricula that your sister and her husband can buy if she struggles that much with educating her kid. There are also free curricula sources all over the internet and as long as she's following your state laws regarding record keeping and testing, you have no business deciding whether or not you think she's suitable to teach her kid. What qualifications do you have to make that judgement? Just your opinion? Also, you made no mention of how old her daughter is. If she's preschool age, most of the \"education\" she'll be getting is through play, even in a public preschool setting.

I don't like to pry.  Anyways they had decent money and investments and took random jobs that paid alright but didn't eat up much time.  They decided to homeschool their kids because the older one had autism and they didn't agree with how public schools worked.  Their kids both graduated from Cornell by the age of 21.

The older one has a degree in ornithology(I think he loves birds but could also be some other science degree).

I don't like that there are people who insist on avoiding discussing sexual health or that there is backlash about even acknowledging in schools that LGBTQ people and racism exist. I want my children to learn about other religions and other people, not just our religion. I want my children to know their people (we're native).

In major metropolitan areas there are co-ops where parents can get help with teaching and curriculum. In our area there is a \"school\" where parents can get help with the harder subjects during the middle and high school years.  For example: if a child needs a foreign language, you can pay for just a Spanish class.  Your child needs Physics and you don't feel qualified to teach it, you pay for your child to attend there for Physics.  It's a really cool system and really affordable.  Most of the teachers are retired public school teachers and they say the kids are really respectful and well adjusted. \n\nYTA because it seems you were really out to humiliate your sister.

However, if you go to chat gpt, you can have it recommend resources (for free) to teach you all the way through and beyond highschool. \n3. Shootings. This is the big one. School shootings are a legitimate reason to not send your kids to public schools. In fact, they are a big enough problem that the public schools might be better off shut down. \n4.

But she knows enough to make it herself, and more importantly she can do 1 v 1 tutoring. \n\nIn summary, the public school system has failed america. The social contract is dead, and as a nation we would be better off going it on our own. Our own laws, our own communities, our own systems of education.

You are making assumptions that home schooling has to be like school at home and that the child is going to get all their knowledge (or lack thereof) from the parent. It isn't like that.

Most of what I did at home was just helping with the homework set by the teachers and we spent little time at home because we were always going to things. One of my daughters is now a manager at a bar, the other one went to medical school (she later had to withdraw due to health problems and is now on disability but that's beside the point), one went to Thailand as part of her lawyer training and my teenage son has been doing a BTEC and is starting a performing arts course at college in September after being home educated his whole life. He wants to work in television. My just 4 year old I will also be home educating. He goes to an outdoor playgroup and also a home Ed social group that meets weekly so there's plenty of other little ones he can play with. I will of course be introducing more as he gets older.

I can't move within the local FB homeschool groups without tripping over excursions, science lab classes, blacksmithing classes, citizen science opportunities, music groups, etc. And Zoom and online learning opportunities mean even the more rural and isolated families (who often homeschool because the nearest school is 6 hrs away) can take part in things they might have difficulty connecting with.\n\nHomeschooling here is SO different to what I've seen in the US. And it really seems as though most non-homeschoolers in the US think that the entire homeschooling community is made up of religious fundies wanting to shield their kids from science. That might have been true once, and there are still lots of those in the current homeschooling community over there, but secular and academically rigourous homeschoolers are increasingly the norm.\n\nJudging an entire community based on outdated tropes and some fundamental misunderstandings about education, socialisation and parent capacity seems like such a questionable approach. And yes, there are some parents who could not and should not homeschool. Just like there are some teachers who cannot and should not teach.
