My roommate exclusively works from home. When I get a package delivered and I'm at work, I'll text my roommate after I get the delivery notification and ask him to get the package off the porch. But most of the time he never does. I'll get home and the package will still be on the porch. I would say 99% of the time he doesn't get it before I get home. It's not an excessive amount, or multiple ones a day. I'm talking less than three in a month. I also don't expect him to immediately jump up and run to the porch, just whenever he has a minute. He always says he'll do it and then he never does. But if he orders something he immediately goes to get it when its delivered. Even if he's in the middle of work he'll drop everything to get it.\n\nMy roommate says I'm being demanding by expecting him to go get it. I'm worried about porch pirates even though it isn't a huge problem here, because it does happen sometimes. I try to get the packages redirected or delivery delayed until I'm home but that's not always possible. I especially worry about them getting stolen when my sister sends me some joints. (She grows her own marijuana and will roll it into joints for me and mail them to me). I think it's common courtesy but my roommate says it's not. If I worked from home and anyone I lived with didn't I would get their packages off the porch but my roommate says I'm wrong to expect it and if I ask and he doesn't go get it, it shouldn't be a big deal even if he replied and told me he would.

He's being an AH.", "NTA it's called being nice. A word not used lately.  It makes for an harmonious home and happy life. Taking minute out of your life to make sure your roommates stuff is safe and secure is the least he can do. To tell you that he will and not do it, he's an AH.", "NTA\n\nAs far as roommate requests go, not an unreasonable one. It's really a low-level of roommate courtesy. You aren't asking him to drop what he's doing. At no point he doesn't have to get up to go to the bathroom or stretch his legs? \n\nNot really worth arguing over, I just wouldn't go out of my way to do them any favors if they ask.", "NAH - it's ok for you to ask, and it's ok for your roommate to forget.\n\nJust make sure you're equally considerate if your roomie asks you to pick some milk up on your way home", "NTA. He calls you demanding? Says you expect it?\n\nNo, you\u2019re asking for a common courtesy and let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s NOT A BIG DEAL for him to do this.\n\nThe fact that he literally refuses to do this one favor says a lot about how self centered and ungenerous he is.\n\nDon\u2019t renew with him.", "INFO 1: How far are we talking to the front porch? In my apartment, that's 3 flights of stairs and 20 yards across the building. (Still not a crazy ask, but enhances the value)\n\nINFO 2: Is it typical for them to be up and about, or is their activity basically limited to their necessities? If so, is there any known reason?\n\nEither way, pretty much leaning NTA - but if you happened to followup with an apartment like mine and a dude on crutches, that could flip.", "I\u2019m detecting a scent of some passive aggressive here. Do you do favors for your roommate when he asks?", "NAH. It\u2019s a reasonable request for you to make. But I know that sometimes my day feels so busy that adding another task just makes me feel overwhelming. Even when it\u2019s something so simple. Maybe it\u2019s my ADD but sometimes that one extra tasks just sends me over. Like when I was a kid and my mom would call me while i was doing homework and tell me to take the meat out of the freezer for dinner. It was the worst because either I had to stop my work and get completely off course or keep working and forgot to do it later. Either was I dreaded the call and I think this package call would feel the same.", ">I'm talking less than three in a month.\n\nNTA and that's ridiculous that a roommate can't be bothered to do something nice at a frequency of 3 times a month.  It's not like you're asking him to drive to the Post Office, he could open the door in his pajamas and bring it in. \n\nThis is such a minimal-effort ask, whether or not he's \"obligated\" doesn't even factor in.", "NAH.  I would definitely be frustrated if I were in your shoes, because it doesn't sound like that much extra work for him.  He's not really under any obligation to do so though, and you can't exactly force him.  Sometimes roommates will run into issues like this and you just have to decide whether you can move past it or if you're just not compatible as roommates.", "NAH. I\u2019d ask him if there\u2019s a favor you can do him in exchange to make it feel fair to him. Maybe pick up groceries for the both of you on your way home once a week or something", "NTA, not at all...\n\nHow hard can it be, to take 20 seconds of your day, to simply recieve and retrieve a package for a friend, who you LIVE with... Seriously, it always blows my mind, how entitled some people are. What if the package would be an expensive device, and your roommate is too lazy to get up for 10 seconds to get it, and it gets stolen? I cant imagine her work being so important, that she is able to get her own package, but leave yours on the PORCH lol.\n\nIts not like you are asking the mate to wait at the door for the postman...", "NTA. He says he'll do it but he doesn't. He makes sure to pick up his packages even if he's busy. He should say he won't get your packages instead of lying.", "NTA - He should get off his lazy but and help. It's not like your asking him to move a couch.", "NTA. There is an argument that he isn\u2019t technically obligated to help you put. However, that kind of hyper individualistic mindset is pretty much against social norms. People help each other when they can, within limits. Spending less than a minute to get the packages off your porch  for your roommate a couple of times a month is very much within that limit.\n\nReally, the only justification he might have is if he hates you for some reason. At which point, we have to analyze whether he is justified in hating you. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.", "Imma say NTA cuz the roommate says he will but never does.\n\nhe\u2019s not obligated to but come on, don\u2019t agree to something if you aren\u2019t gonna do it", "NTA. Your roommate has all day to get it off the stoop, what it will take him 30 seconds out of his day. But if the shoe was on the other foot and you worked from home and he didn\u2019t and he asked you to get his packages and you didn\u2019t, he would be all over about it. He\u2019s a jerk plain and simple.", "NTA Would it kill him to take 10 seconds to go grab it? He\u2019s being really selfish.", "NTA. Your roommate is a putz.", "NAH he sucks for sure but he really has no obligation to do this for you. I would refuse to lift a finger for him though.", "For me it\u2019s bordering on YTA and ESH, but only very slightly on his end. Sure, it would be very nice of him if he did it, but he has no obligations. I do think he is a bit of an asshole if he says he\u2019ll do it and has no intention of grabbing it though; he just needs to tell the truth that he\u2019s not going to grab it.", "Listen, I\u2019ve mailed some illegal stuff in my day, but that was my choice. Your roommate has the absolute right not to participate in a crime that only benefits you. Never do a felony for free, never expect someone else to.  Since those are the packages you most want him to take in, YTA", "I would go and grab it for you but I don't think your roommate is an asshole for not doing it.

You can\u2019t mail weed, even in legal states.", "NTA\n\nI don't think you're an AH for asking... but arguing about it? I would say that is AH territory.  If you're so worried about your packages then get them delivered to a pick up point and get them yourself.\n\nYour roomie is a dingus and I certainly wouldn't want to be friends with someone like that.  But you can't argue him into being a decent person.  Get a PO box or something and just release yourself from the stress of dealing with him.", "NTA. me and my roommates are always asking each other to grab packages when they come in. Whoever gets home first grabs the packages since none of us work from home. If someone happens to be home they run down to get the packages. It\u2019s not hard.", "YTA. You say  it's your roommate, not your friend, not your S/O. They don't owe you anything. Once you realized the roommate wasn't going to bring them in,  you should have stopped asking. AND just because it's something YOU would have no issues doing doesn't make it an obligation for your roommate to feel the same way.", "YTA. Your roommate WORKS from home - you\u2019re asking your roommate to interrupt their job to run an errand for you. My former workplace allowed us to have personal packages delivered to our mail room, I\u2019d have been pissed if my roommate expected me to be responsible for their personal packages and pick them up from our mail room. \n\nIt\u2019s your job to figure out how to keep your packages secure, not your roommate\u2019s.", "NTA for your initial asks, this is a minor roommate courtesy. \n\nNow that you know he consistently doesn't bring your packages in despite telling you that he would, stop asking him.", "NTA.  And I say this as a wfh-er. While our area doesn't have that much of a porch purse issue, if I'm home, I'll go grab the package because it's a1-2 minutes to stretch my legs away from my computer. It's not like he is having to leave the house and go to the store to get the package. \n\nWe did recently have a porch pirate on a Saturday - and we had stepped out for maybe 2 hours. It totally bummed me out and it wasn't even a super important package. (I still hope that person enjoyed the packing tape!)", "If what you are having delivered is illegal, YTA for expecting anyone else to involve themself in criminal behavior for you.  If he accepts the packages, could he in anyway be complicit?", "YTA, but gently.  \n\n\nYour roommate is under no obligation to get your packages off the porch.  Think of it this way -- what would you do if your roommate also worked away from home, or if you lived alone?  You would still be responsible for your own shipments.\n\nIt's not great that he agrees to get them and then fails to do so -- that's on him -- but if it's happened enough times you should get the hint and understand you cannot rely on him for this \"added service\".  \n\n\nSo, in the future, either find an alternative delivery (my work allows us to get mail at the office, for example, or you could get a post office box), or don't shop online as much.", "i\u2019d say NTA, when i lived with roomates and one of us got home and there was a package by the door, we\u2019d just bring it in and leave it on the table for whoever ordered it. Granted, me and my roomies were all pretty close friends so it was never really an issue for us. But i\u2019d also be pretty annoyed if one of them said they would bring it in and didn\u2019t. He shouldn\u2019t say he\u2019ll bring it in if he knows he\u2019s not going to.", "NTA, I've lived with ppl several times and in my experience whoever is around takes packages in. I mean unless it's something huge or needs a signature who cares, it's so easy. It's just common courtesy.", "YTA for making such an issue out of it.\n\nThey forget, they get busy, they just do not want to, whatever. It\u2019d be nice of them, but it isn\u2019t an expectation of them, so stop treating it as such.", "It's hard to take a side. I wanna side with you because it's such a small favor to ask. But there are reasons not to go outside, if it's too hot or cold. If it's too sunny or windy.\n\nAnd technically your roommate doesn't owe you any favors. \n\nI think it's fair to hold this against him if he ever asks you any favors in the future", "YTA. Your packages are not your roommate's responsibility.\n\n\"If our situations were reversed, I would do it for them.\" Really? So, how many other sorts of favors have you done for your roommate recently?

It's your responsibility to make sure the packages are received by someone or take precautions, not your roommate's.", "NTA it doesn\u2019t take time or energy to grab a package off the porch. He\u2019s just being extra.", "NTA. It's called being a roommate. The next time they need anything, you say no because of this.", "Nta. I sure wouldn't do him any favors from now on. But I'm petty like that.  I think Ama*on offers puck locations now.\nYou're roommate is either lazy and forgetful, or just selfish", "NTA if he works from home and does nothing all day but be on the computer he can surely take some time to get a couple packages when they come lol.", "Light YTA. It's not his property, it's yours. So it's not his responsibility.  It would be kind of him to get your packages, but he is under no obligation to do so.\n\nI would recommend a package locker at your house. You can build them easily, there's YouTube tutorials and whatnot. Ours at my old house was wooden. The mail carrier could put packages in but once inside they cannot be removed without the key. Or you could have your packages delivered to a PO box or paid package locker.", "NTA - I WFH 3/5 days a week and don't mins doing this for my husband or even my neighbours if they want tbh. It is usually a nice excuse to get a few extra steps during a day that otherwise is difficult to get away from the computer. Co-workers have room-mates and do the same for them if they are the only one home. Never really known people to have such issues, WFH is a wonderful privledge and we all usually just feel grateful to do more at home because of it.\n\nI guess it depends on the workload for the person, but surely leaving the desk for 1 min is not unreasonable?", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s just common courtesy unless you\u2019re demanding he grab them, especially if it\u2019s not often and you\u2019re not expecting him to grab them right that second.", "NTA\n\nI've only had past roommate experiences with people I've previously had friendships or acquaintances with  and we became closer through living together.
