Marijuana is legal here and so is mailing it. My roommate also smokes it and doesn't object to it.*\n\n*ETA #2: Since his room and home office are on opposite sides of the front door and his windows open up onto the porch, and I do favours like let him use my car and be on my insurance I figured this wasn't a big ask. Though I might be wrong.*\n\nI want to know if I'm being the asshole here, or if my roommate is wrong.\n\nI'm a government contractor and the nature of my work means I can't work from home. My roommate exclusively works from home. When I get a package delivered and I'm at work, I'll text my roommate after I get the delivery notification and ask him to get the package off the porch. But most of the time he never does. I'll get home and the package will still be on the porch. I would say 99% of the time he doesn't get it before I get home. It's not an excessive amount, or multiple ones a day. I'm talking less than three in a month. I also don't expect him to immediately jump up and run to the porch, just whenever he has a minute. He always says he'll do it and then he never does. But if he orders something he immediately goes to get it when its delivered. Even if he's in the middle of work he'll drop everything to get it.\n\nMy roommate says I'm being demanding by expecting him to go get it. I'm worried about porch pirates even though it isn't a huge problem here, because it does happen sometimes. I try to get the packages redirected or delivery delayed until I'm home but that's not always possible. I especially worry about them getting stolen when my sister sends me some joints. (She grows her own marijuana and will roll it into joints for me and mail them to me). I think it's common courtesy but my roommate says it's not. If I worked from home and anyone I lived with didn't I would get their packages off the porch but my roommate says I'm wrong to expect it and if I ask and he doesn't go get it, it shouldn't be a big deal even if he replied and told me he would.

But I know that sometimes my day feels so busy that adding another task just makes me feel overwhelming. Even when it\u2019s something so simple. Maybe it\u2019s my ADD but sometimes that one extra tasks just sends me over.

I would definitely be frustrated if I were in your shoes, because it doesn't sound like that much extra work for him.

There is an argument that he isn\u2019t technically obligated to help you put. However, that kind of hyper individualistic mindset is pretty much against social norms. People help each other when they can, within limits. Spending less than a minute to get the packages off your porch  for your roommate a couple of times a month is very much within that limit.\n\nReally, the only justification he might have is if he hates you for some reason. At which point, we have to analyze whether he is justified in hating you.

And I say this as a wfh-er. While our area doesn't have that much of a porch purse issue, if I'm home, I'll go grab the package because it's a1-2 minutes to stretch my legs away from my computer.

Granted, me and my roomies were all pretty close friends so it was never really an issue for us. But i\u2019d also be pretty annoyed if one of them said they would bring it in and didn\u2019t.

The recipient may also be asked to provide government-issued photo ID if they appear to be less than 30 years of age. Provinces set the minimum age to purchase cannabis.\n\nReceiving from an individual\nA signature may be required upon delivery if the sender opted for this feature.\"\nhttps://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/personal/sending/parcels/restrictions/cannabis.page\n\nAnyway, if an ID and/or signature was needed then they wouldn't simply leave the package on her porch, eh?** OP texts her roommate to bring in the package only after she receives a notification that the package was delivered.\n\n** I've never used \"eh?\" to end a sentence before. Am I doing it right?", "Absolutely this. If it's too much trouble for him to get your packages, then it's too much of a risk for him to be on your insurance.", "That\u2019s not true. Just has to be signed for by someone at the residence who is over 18 or 19 (depending on the province). As long as the package is odourless, sealed, and unmarked it\u2019s perfectly legal to mail weed. His sister could mail him a big ole box of joints. Requiring a signature is to keep the packages from getting stolen more than anything.", "Dude my realtor got our packages for us in the middle of winter.... roommate is such an ass", "Much like using the car and being on the insurance, hint hint.", "Then say, \"Sorry, I can't do that.\"\n\nDon't say, \"Oh, of course!\" and then \"forget\".", "OP literally lets his roommate use his car, so the quid pro quo would be to get the packages at the very least.\n\nEdit: missed a word", "Aren't there insurances for stolen packages in Canada ? At this point I would remove roommate from the insurance and take one for stolen packages", "Roommate is obligated , because he said he would pick up packages. He Obligated himself, could have said No or not respond.", "I\u2019m curious, what are the roommates fridge preferences?", "That's true, drivers are in extremely tight schedules. I am in a wheelchair and have a ramp up to my door. My biggest problem with deliveries is the drivers place the boxes directly in front of my door so I can't open it. Thankfully my husband can usually get it before the porch pirates do. \n\nBefore I became disabled we had a pontoon boat. It was on the trailer backed in beside our attached garage, with a vehicle parked in front of it. I had ordered an expensive trolling motor for the hubby. I got a message indicating the monitor had been delivered. We went out on the porch expecting to haul the package into the garage until we had a chance to install it. We couldn't find the package anywhere so I called the brown delivery truck office. They contacted the driver, who happened to be our regular delivery guy, (he's retired now) and asked him about the package. Bless his heart, this awesome driver put that 80 lb motor on the pontoon deck! The pontoon sat up pretty high so I'm sure it was quite a chore to get it up there. I have the utmost respect for the drivers who really provide good service.", "If it was expensive (over here at least) there would be some sort of signature required, so if you didn\u2019t answer they\u2019d take the parcel back and you\u2019d have to rearrange delivery. It blows my mind that in a country where \u2018porch pirates\u2019 are a thing, that you wouldn\u2019t just get off your arse and answer the door.", "Yeah I too have ADHD and am Forgetful Jones on a *good* day, and I still manage to collect packages, it is not that difficult\n\nThere isn\u00b4t any reason that the roommate cannot do it, did not mean to imply that he isn\u00b4t the asshole.\n\nJust wanted to put an idea there that maybe he is not just pure 100pct lazy ass", "OP please give us an update on whether you remove him from your insurance or not. Since he said you're being too demanding then give him that same answer when he asks why he's not on the insurance and can't use your car anymore.", "Because it is illegal federally, it is illegal to mail it.", "NTA, this should be a I scratch your back, you scratch mine situation, but since he won't scratch your back, don't scratch his. Take him off your insurance. Don't let him borrow your car.", "your realtor is a very rare person, how lovely of them", "just as literally anyone else can for the hours OP isnt. instead of his roomate taking a minute to not let his roomate get robbed.", "OP lives in Canada not the US", "Yes, it's a favor, not a right. The roommate is not obligated to do OP a (small!) favor, but it makes him a ah not to do so. NTA"]}
