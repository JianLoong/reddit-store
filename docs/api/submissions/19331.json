Marijuana is legal here and so is mailing it. My roommate also smokes it and doesn't object to it.*\n\n*ETA #2: Since his room and home office are on opposite sides of the front door and his windows open up onto the porch, and I do favours like let him use my car and be on my insurance I figured this wasn't a big ask. Though I might be wrong.*\n\nI want to know if I'm being the asshole here, or if my roommate is wrong.\n\nI'm a government contractor and the nature of my work means I can't work from home. My roommate exclusively works from home. When I get a package delivered and I'm at work, I'll text my roommate after I get the delivery notification and ask him to get the package off the porch. But most of the time he never does. I'll get home and the package will still be on the porch. I would say 99% of the time he doesn't get it before I get home. It's not an excessive amount, or multiple ones a day. I'm talking less than three in a month. I also don't expect him to immediately jump up and run to the porch, just whenever he has a minute. He always says he'll do it and then he never does. But if he orders something he immediately goes to get it when its delivered. Even if he's in the middle of work he'll drop everything to get it.\n\nMy roommate says I'm being demanding by expecting him to go get it. I'm worried about porch pirates even though it isn't a huge problem here, because it does happen sometimes. I try to get the packages redirected or delivery delayed until I'm home but that's not always possible. I especially worry about them getting stolen when my sister sends me some joints. (She grows her own marijuana and will roll it into joints for me and mail them to me). I think it's common courtesy but my roommate says it's not. If I worked from home and anyone I lived with didn't I would get their packages off the porch but my roommate says I'm wrong to expect it and if I ask and he doesn't go get it, it shouldn't be a big deal even if he replied and told me he would.

But I know that sometimes my day feels so busy that adding another task just makes me feel overwhelming. Even when it\u2019s something so simple. Maybe it\u2019s my ADD but sometimes that one extra tasks just sends me over. Like when I was a kid and my mom would call me while i was doing homework and tell me to take the meat out of the freezer for dinner.

I would definitely be frustrated if I were in your shoes, because it doesn't sound like that much extra work for him.

There is an argument that he isn\u2019t technically obligated to help you put. However, that kind of hyper individualistic mindset is pretty much against social norms. People help each other when they can, within limits. Spending less than a minute to get the packages off your porch  for your roommate a couple of times a month is very much within that limit.\n\nReally, the only justification he might have is if he hates you for some reason. At which point, we have to analyze whether he is justified in hating you.

And I say this as a wfh-er. While our area doesn't have that much of a porch purse issue, if I'm home, I'll go grab the package because it's a1-2 minutes to stretch my legs away from my computer. It's not like he is having to leave the house and go to the store to get the package. \n\nWe did recently have a porch pirate on a Saturday - and we had stepped out for maybe 2 hours.

Granted, me and my roomies were all pretty close friends so it was never really an issue for us. But i\u2019d also be pretty annoyed if one of them said they would bring it in and didn\u2019t.

He's not obligated to grab the package, nor is he entitled to the use of OPs car.", ">Seriously, it always blows my mind, how entitled some people are. What if the package would be an expensive device, and your roommate is too lazy to get up for 10 seconds to get it, and it gets stolen? I cant imagine her work being so important, that she is able to get her own package, but leave yours on the PORCH lol.\n\nExactly! I'd have that much basic goodwill and courtesy towards any roommate, even if I disliked them, and ESPECIALLY if they were letting me use their car and be on their car insurance!", "No, it isn\u2019t okay for him to \u201cforget.\u201d He isn\u2019t forgetting once is a blue moon.

OP's not even asking him to do it as soon as the package comes - just within the same day. When I lived with roommates, I picked up so many of their packages from the front without ever being asked, and if they did ask me to keep an eye out for a delivery they were expecting, I would always do so. They did the same for me with my packages/deliveries. It's just part and parcel (pun intended) of living together, and it's such a non-issue that it never even had to be a discussion, let alone an argument. OP's roommate is choosing an extremely weird hill to die on..", "EXACTLY! He would\u2019ve been off my insurance", "Paying the extra is expected since you're adding his name. The question is whether he does basic car maintenance as well since he's using the car. Did he fill the tank? Did he ever take the car for a wash? And so on.

See how he likes it when the shoe's on the other foot.", "Dont pick up his packages on the way in", "NTA and being a good roommate is a two way street.\n\nIf he is not prepared to do you a small favour, stuff him!  He can get around the best way he knows how, get his own bloody fridge and keep that how he likes it and his parcels can stay where they are until he picks them up.\n\nBe a good roommate, yes, don't be a doormat (you can buy those, you don't need to be one yourself :) )", "This is correct, sadly many people don\u00b4t realize how much pressure the drivers have with a camera watching them all the time in the car, a clock/GPS calculating whether they spent 1 minute more than the algorithm thinks is needed, and a supervisor waiting to give them a problem/threaten their job for being slow too many times\n\nIt is not good for the customer who would like a package delivered according to specific instructions, but the driver is NTA, he/she cannot give that higher level of service most of the time.

I disagree. I'm always forgetting the same stuff. Especially if I get distracted doing something.
