I said ok and she moved in in the beginning of the month. She took issue with wording in the lease so I amended it and sent it back to her to sign and return.

The lease is month to month so I can give her 30 days notice to leave. Other red flags:\n\n- She left town for a ~week or so and left stuff out in the common area where it disrupted day to day use. Think leaving a bag of laundry on the couch or bagged groceries on the kitchen counter.\n\n- She left a space heater on in her room which I turned off when I noticed a burning smell (I take issue with this from the utility bill and safety standpoint). She pays a flat rate on utilities. \n\n- She has an enormous amount of stuff that\u2019s overflowing into areas outside of her allotted space, making other spaces unusable. (E.g. I have a home office that\u2019s currently being used as storage for her excess stuff. I told her it needs to be cleared in 2 weeks, we\u2019re four days out and it\u2019s still the same).
