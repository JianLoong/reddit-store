The very next day, my ex starts on our daughter 13F and she moves in with him. 3 days ago, I arrive to pick up my daughter so we can head to my family\u2019s home for a belated Christmas and I\u2019m accosted by SM, who is angry I parked in front of her house, she slams my door shut, effectively injuring me.\n\nMy daughter comes out in tears, struggling to breathe and says \u201cjust drive\u201d. I do, a few minutes later I need to pull over and help my daughter take deep breaths to settle down, she lets me know she hadn\u2019t eaten and they would yell at her if she stepped out of her room so I buy her food.\n\nWe find out that Ex and SM broke up as she gave him an ultimatum her or the kids and he chose the kids. Hours later they are back together. \n\nThey had taken her phone off her, gone through her messages and because she had left a note about wanting a break from them (all before she ran to my car), well yesterday she sees notes to her Snapchat stories that they love her. She goes through her Snapchat messages and realises they have been reading them.\n\nMy daughter gets a call from her friend informing her that SM has called her letting her friends know that my daughter stole something but no item has been identified. My daughter messages her father to contact her and she gets no reply. Hours later SM Snapchats her - we are going to talk and my daughter says no, SM gets aggressive about it, my daughter goes off at her about the infidelity, ultimatum and her friends, and I get my daughter to block her after SM responds she is here to stay. \n\nI\u2019m over these arguments, I no longer have the energy to help my kids navigate them.

Time to see a lawyer or go to court yourself so your child custody can be changed. \n\nI do not know the jurisdiction you live in, but in mine, the opinion of teenaged minors is taken seriously when it comes to deciding where to live at, so your children being so \"old\" would allow them to be heard about the way they leave at their dad's and step mom's. \n\nAt the very least, consult a free legal hotline (there is a chance that there is one where you live, whether it's the bar association's referral to lawyers who give free 30 minutes consultation, law school clinique where the advice is offered by students supervised by their teachers, etc.), you have a way to figure out your legal options without shelling out hundreds and thousands of dollars.
