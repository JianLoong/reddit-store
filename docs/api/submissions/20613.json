Very good idea to get this hypothetical on the table before making vows.

She feels the same.  \n\nIt's not a fun conversation, but it's one that is appropriate in a long-term relationship like marriage.\n\nI'm sorry it turned in to a fight in your case.", "NAH- But you also need to know that there are many people who have stayed with spouses that had permanent or degenerative cognitive conditions while also allowing themselves to find an equal partnership with someone else while maintaining support to their spouse. You don\u2019t have to abandon your spouse. \n\nThese are good conversations to have before you get married. Having a plan for these situations- and a sense of timing. For example it would be helpful to know that your not going to look for someone else after two weeks but after a year or so and only in the case of a hopeless prognosis. \n\nBut even with that , she has the right to want a straight monogamous marriage till death due we part. You two may just have incompatible beliefs and desires \n\nYou have the right to feel the way you do", "NAH I get this is an unpopular opinion, but the issue seems to be communication style and that you were having 2 different conversations.\n\nFor you this conversation stopped at the surface of what she was saying. Strictly hypothetical and nothing to get worked up over. But for her this clearly was more than the surface. It seems like she was seeking reassurance that you won\u2019t leave her if something bad happens. (Ie: she won\u2019t become a part of that awful statistic where men overwhelmingly leave their wives if they get cancer or are otherwise unable to care for themselves and their husband). \n\nCommunication is something to work on moving forward.

It\u2019s just a misunderstanding that should be relatively easy to avoid moving forward.\n\n(Cr*pple is a slur with a horrific history.

After that, I would break up with you. Sure, it\u2019s a hypothetical but why would she take the risk? Once something like that would happen, she couldn\u2019t fight for herself. So she has to make good choices now", "Yes, YTA", "YTA. You dont tell people that. You stay as long as you can and dont leave them mentally before something like this happens.

No one says you are not allowed to find love again but it should not be the first impulse.", "YTA - You really need to re-evaluate how you view relationships. Look at traditional wedding vows. \"For richer or poorer, *in sickness and in health*, until death do you part.\" Are you willing to spend your entire life with this person, no matter what happens? That's what a life-long relationship means. You cannot put a caveat on mental health. You stand by them until death separates you. And guess what? It goes both ways.

This might be your opinion now, but what if you've been married for over 30 years? You'll most probably sit right next to her anyway.
