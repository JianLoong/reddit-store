She asked you a question and you gave an absolutely honest answer. It's actually respectable of you because she can at least make a decision on whether or not she sees a future. \n\nI can see both if yalls sides if I'm being completely honest. I can see it being extremely hard  to stay with someone in a vegetative state, but can see her side of wanting someone to be there for me until the end, even if that option is very selfish for myself.", "Definitely NAH. It's a scary nightmare to have.", "This is basically the same as the classic \u201cWould you date me if I was a worm\u201d question", "NTA.   Very good idea to get this hypothetical on the table before making vows.    Personally I think the idea of til death do us part is unreasonable and unrealistic, because often people change and can change so drastically that it\u2019s impossible to get along, and if one of you can absolutely no longer be happy then the other should be willing to let them go.", "NTA\n\nIF your SO is in a state where the body (sorta, with help) works but the mind is long gone, with no hope of reversal, ever... then that is no longer the PERSON you owe loyalty to: it's just a sack of meat being artificially kept 'alive'.\n\nIt's honestly my worst nightmare and my spouse knows if I'm ever in that state she 100% should pull the plug and let nature take it's course.  She feels the same.  \n\nIt's not a fun conversation, but it's one that is appropriate in a long-term relationship like marriage.\n\nI'm sorry it turned in to a fight in your case.", "NAH- But you also need to know that there are many people who have stayed with spouses that had permanent or degenerative cognitive conditions while also allowing themselves to find an equal partnership with someone else while maintaining support to their spouse. You don\u2019t have to abandon your spouse. \n\nThese are good conversations to have before you get married. Having a plan for these situations- and a sense of timing. For example it would be helpful to know that your not going to look for someone else after two weeks but after a year or so and only in the case of a hopeless prognosis. \n\nBut even with that , she has the right to want a straight monogamous marriage till death due we part. You two may just have incompatible beliefs and desires \n\nYou have the right to feel the way you do", "NAH I get this is an unpopular opinion, but the issue seems to be communication style and that you were having 2 different conversations.\n\nFor you this conversation stopped at the surface of what she was saying. Strictly hypothetical and nothing to get worked up over. But for her this clearly was more than the surface. It seems like she was seeking reassurance that you won\u2019t leave her if something bad happens. (Ie: she won\u2019t become a part of that awful statistic where men overwhelmingly leave their wives if they get cancer or are otherwise unable to care for themselves and their husband). \n\nCommunication is something to work on moving forward. But neither of you were trying to hurt each other or cause drama. It\u2019s just a misunderstanding that should be relatively easy to avoid moving forward.\n\n(Cr*pple is a slur with a horrific history. I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t know since you just tossed it out there in your explanation).", "NTA. It is your opinion and you are entitled to it. You are being straightforward with her and providing her with the opportunity to think this through and make her decision accordingly. This is a behaviour that I respect a lot.", "Egghhh NTA. She asked, you gave an honest answer. I think it would be worse to lie, and then God forbid that did happen, and you abandon her. If anything, she has a clearer picture of your relationship. Not everyone would expect their partner to stay in that situation, but it seems like she does.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhat does she expect?! For you to \"stay with her\" when she's lying in a hospital bed unable to speak for the next 30 years? Personally, I think that if you love someone, you wouldn't want that for them. And the fact that she got mad at a friggin hypothetical question is just ridiculous.", "NTA \n\nYou were just honest. But you might rethink your relationship. I wouldn't want to stay with someone who would leave me if I got seriously ill. \n\nI know that my SO is THE ONE because I feel like even if he was a vegetable all I would want to do is to take care of him the best I could.", "NTA\n\nI was in that situation.   \n\nWith something that traumatic, you have no idea what you would  *actually*  do,  and you *won't* know until you're in that situation.\n\nBefore my husbands illness, there were I so many things I said I'd never do.  After my husbands illness?  I did them all and then, some things I *never*  imagined doing (drain tubes. Yuck).\n\nYou can speculate all you want.  You just dont know.  Why lie?", "NAH\n\nBut if she thinks you ain't committed to her in the way she expects of a relationship, that's fair.", "Misleading title. I thought maybe your girlfriend when on the whole \u201cwould you still love me if I was a carrot\u201d type of post. It\u2019s still on that level of ridiculousness so NTA", "I think it's great that you were honest. So many women get married only to find out the ugly truth later. Now she knows to skip the marriage and divorce altogether. Sadly, she will likely still find your as a good future partner and the cycle of thinking you can change a person will continue.", "ESH for getting into an argument over a hypothetical situation.", "YTA, why didn't you just say yes? She asked you about one scenario and you decided to turn it into another for no reason. What were you trying to gain here?", "Imo I'd rather just have myself a pleasant and rapid death than ask my partner to stick with me if I'm a vegetable. Pull the plug, be sad for a while, then I'd hope they moved on and continue to enjoy the remainder of their life. NTA", "YTA. Why would you tell somebody that?", "YTA. After that, I would break up with you. Sure, it\u2019s a hypothetical but why would she take the risk? Once something like that would happen, she couldn\u2019t fight for herself. So she has to make good choices now", "Yes, YTA", "YTA. You dont tell people that. You stay as long as you can and dont leave them mentally before something like this happens. Because that\u2019s what you do. In the event of her being mentally unresponsive you have already left her without a second thought. But in this event you should be there for her. No one says you are not allowed to find love again but it should not be the first impulse.", "YTA - You really need to re-evaluate how you view relationships. Look at traditional wedding vows. \"For richer or poorer, *in sickness and in health*, until death do you part.\" Are you willing to spend your entire life with this person, no matter what happens? That's what a life-long relationship means. You cannot put a caveat on mental health. You stand by them until death separates you. And guess what? It goes both ways. They will stand by you in the same way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I don\u2019t want them alone", "NTA at all - I adore my husband, and if he were in a permanent vegetative state I\u2019d make sure he got the best care and visit often, but I wouldn\u2019t stay faithful forever; nor would I expect it of him if the tables were turned - it would be incredibly cruel to expect him to be lonely forever, when I\u2019m not even really there anymore.", "Well my partner loves gardening so ... yes, he probably would. And the compost would be amazing.", "Until death do us part was before we had heroic measures halfway brining people back and leaving them in persistent vegetative states.", "Worked in a nursing home, had one poor woman who was young (happened in her laye 40s, early 50s was when I started and met them) one day she'd been at work, and just, bam. Cerebral hemorrhage. She lived but mentally was down to like a 10 year old and couldn't care for herself. Her husband came in at least once a week, took her out for birthdays and holidays and the like, and about 10 years in, he's got a girlfriend and is happy again, and still keeps coming in and supporting his wife. \n\nA few of us felt weird about it, but also was the poor guy just supposed to be alone for the rest of his life? As far as she knows she still has a devoted husband (and she does) and he has his own happiness and support structure. It would destroy her if she found out. . . .  For the day or two she retained the information at least, but what she doesn't know doesn't hurt her in this case.", "I agree with this too. I worked in a young people\u2019s neurodisability unit and saw this happen a few times. Spouses visited regularly but after years had other partners.

My mistake.", "OP isn\u2019t talking about mental health.   He\u2019s talking about partner becoming vegetative which means completely unconscious and unable to move, can not wake up and no hope of recovery.", "While I can see your point, not all relationships are built on these principles. My husband and I have been together almost ten years and I've been very clear that if something similar to what the OP said were to happen to me, that I would want him to walk away and move on. If I'm a vegetable and all the things that made me who I am are gone, he deserves to keep living. I don't want someone to be imprisoned by the love they hold for me, especially if I could no longer give them that same love.", "I wholeheartedly agree with you. I actually told him to make sure someone turned the switch off. I'd rather they remember me when it was actually me than put himself and our kids in the position of having to watch me wither.\nEdit to say NTA"]}
