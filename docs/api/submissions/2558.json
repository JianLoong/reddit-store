The fact that she's had money in the past to purchase tattoos has no bearing on her current financial situation. Are you aware of what has happened to the cost of living in the states?\n\nJust for me personally, 75% of my disposable income has had to be reallocated to essentials, just due to inflation in the past 2 years. Have some compassion for your daughter. Asking her to pull 2 grand out of her ass is no small ask. 70% of Americans don't even have $1000 in savings.", "Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll teach her a lesson for wanting to come visit you.

She is an adult and it\u2019s not really your business how she spends her money, she is your daughter and you should be trusting what she is literally telling you. The cost of living really is high, and for our age group of 20 year olds, it is seriously tough. $2000-$3000 in one payment is a serious amount of money.", "YTA when she's spending money on tattoos its not instead of plane tickets to visit you. The fact she didnt have money for tickets has nothing to do with the tattoos. Sure they're a non essential expense but a good amount of people spend quite a bit of money on non essential hobbies/interests. Furthermore, (as far as i know) you dont know how much shes spent on tattoos so it could be interpreted as you just picking something you disaprove of subconsciously. Its unclear how long she had this trip planned but finding an expendible $3000 is very different than $400 for a tattoo (just an estimate). I dont think that youve been awful but the comment was ignorant and i can see why shed be uspet.", "YTA. Flying is expensive and almost no job pays an actual living wage.

You just want to punish your daughter for her own decisions about her body.", "Buy your daughter the plane ticket and be glad she wants to come stay with you. And shut up about her tats, YTA.", "I don't think it was that out of line, and I say this as a somewhat heavily tattooed guy myself. Good tattoos are crazy expensive and shouldn't be as much of a priority as being able to see your family. I get where you're coming from, if she can spend a few thousand dollars on tattoos she should be able to afford half of a plane ticket to see you, or at least would be able to afford them had she not gotten tattoos, and her job was enough to pay for them. But if she doesn't have any new ones lined up, it is a useless thing to say since that comment won't bring back the money she already spent.", "YTA.

You made a valid point, if you can't afford stuff then stop spending money on non-essentials. It wasn't judgment on tattoos, it was a  common sense comment.

You can't complain that you have no money and then spend money on \"luxuries\".", "YTA but caveat\n\nYour daughter does whatever she wants with her money and it's none of your business. Also why don't you transfer her the half before she buys the ticket. I live in the US, my parents in France, my dad buys my plane tickets and then I reimburse him whatever we agreed on (depends on if I bring my kids) and I don't have to reimburse him all at once, last year he let me pay in two times.

She should have known better.", "YTA. Her finances in the past doesn't influence her current situation and you making that comment definitely makes you the asshole in this situation.", "Yta. I would definitely be saving my money and canceling that trip. Maybe she'll get a new tattoo", "YTA, you shouldn\u2019t be judging your daughter based off being \u201cheavily tattooed\u201d and assuming that she spends all her money on it.", "NTA.\n\nSorry, but that's tough love.

It\u2019s important to know that he is saying \u201cheavily tattooed \u201c but we don\u2019t know what that means.  Does she have full sleeves, a back piece and her legs done? Or could his opinion of heavily tattooed mean a half sleeve or even 2-3 tattoos.  And she, like most of us fiscally irresponsible tattooed folks, get our tattoos over many years.   I\u2019m any case, saying she isn\u2019t handling her money \u201ctoo responsible \u201c is a ridiculous comment.  She works 2 jobs so she can spend her money as she sees fit.  If she wants tattoos, that\u2019s not irresponsible. That is her working for what SHE wants. She owes her dad nothing.  \n\nHe says she isn\u2019t saving as much as him, well, things are different than they were 20 years ago.

Mom's point was that if she stopped buying tattoos, she would have the money.", "You would if you knew how to save and had your priorities straight.", "So maybe she's rather spend money on tattoos than on visiting you? Is that what you're getting at? I mean if my parent moved to the other side of the world when I was twelve, I probably wouldn't be spending 2000 or 3000 to go visit them when I was 23 either. If they wanted me to visit at that age (young enough to still be considered 'starting out' IMO), I wouldn't go unless they paid for it. They are the one that left. If it was when I was in my 40's, that would be different. I'd probably have more discretionary income by then. You should pay all of it and apologise for being snide.
