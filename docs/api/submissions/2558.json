It's gone up a lot, recently.\n\nMany jobs *don't* pay enough to cover people's basic expenses.\n\nWhy is that hard to understand?", "So is the issue that she cant afford to pay half? What if she saves up for a bit, and then you guys purchase the ticket when she has enough money? If she saves money over 2 paycheques would that work? I think the timeline is relevant here. Did you guys plan this months ago and now all of a sudden she\u2019s saying she can\u2019t pay half?", "What about my name?", "Dude why are you even worked up and between me and you I think we know who needs therapy", "it's logical but not reasonable; glad you can recognize that.", "Kath and Kim was not supposed to be a parenting guide, I think OP missed that detail.", "Boomah-rang?", "I like having mine easily hidden because it\u2019s like having a secret. When I decide the world can see it I get compliments and often surprise because apparently I \u201cdon\u2019t look like the type to have tattoos\u201d which I\u2019m not sure what that means exactly because no one can really explain it. It\u2019s mine and I decide when others see it.", "When I was in college, 25 years ago, I thought about getting a job where you ask people sign petitions, it paid $10/hr. Same job now? Still pays $10/hr. It's like this for so many different positions too. It's ridiculous! \n\nAlso, YTA. It's extremely difficult to save money as low as wages are. If it's not that hard for you be grateful and offer to pay for your daughter's ticket.", "No but he is trying to force her to pay the full cost up front even though he\u2019s planning on reimbursing her. That\u2019s a huge amount to be coming out of her account in one hit and it\u2019s unsurprising she may not be able to cover that, the tattoos are irrelevant.", "My sister had her\u2019s done in Tallahassee Florida, tho admittedly her tattoo was very simple with minimal shading like she wanted. The man who drew it up had finished tattooing it in only one and half hours. It was $200 for the time and about 75 for him to make an original design for her (she didn\u2019t get it done in the same day so I didn\u2019t really think about it) so technically $275. When it comes to large intricate designs with full shading and color I have no doubt they get extremely expensive but my point for the commenter was you can have a lot of tattoos, even large ones, that don\u2019t nearly equate to $3000 in the us. (It felt especially important bc no details were given on how complex or big they were.)\nWhere do you live that your country is well known for it too be unheard of to have cheaper tattoos? Bc a small one here can be as low as $50 depending on the tattoo itself, area and shop.", "She said she has never paid close to 1,000 for them. The most she has paid is $700 ish. But she also has known her artist for a very long time and they are roommates/friends.", "Because it was an extremely cheap and ignorant shot at something that brought her child joy?\n Exit: also op has commented that she hasn\u2019t had any large tattoos done recently and her daughter would have spent the same money she used on the tattoos to buy or pay for other things. This was legitimately the parent seeing an opportunity to be ugly about something they didn\u2019t like about their child\u2019s choices and diving for it.", "OP is the dad.", "And that point is a bad one. First of all, nowhere does it say the daughter is currently spending money on tattoos. Secondly, even if she had never gotten a single tattoo, that does not mean she would have all her tattoo money saved up right now. In all likelihood, most, if not all, of that money would be spent on something else.\n\nDad\u2019s comment does *nothing* to change current circumstances. All it does is make it clear he disapproves of and doesn\u2019t respect his daughter\u2019s choices. All it does is make her feel shitty. That\u2019s not just a nasty thing to do, it also makes it far less likely that his daughter will even want to shell out 1-2k on plane tickets to visit him.", "It also seems to have been the daughter\u2019s idea to go on the trip in the first place per OP\u2019s first paragraph.  Mum is correct.  Tattoos are expensive.", "Not your name, the OP.", "What a sad attempt at a response...  So, either you're a low-effort troll or just too stupid and lazy to go for a real argument, to defend yourself.\n\nJudging by your attitude toward parenting, I'm going with that second one.\n\nEnjoy the retirement home.", ">I moved from her when she was 12. \n\nOkay, so not only did you put yourself into this position you're trying to cry \"woe is me\" about, you essentially abandoned your preteen daughter in the process? Do you have any idea what the mental affects of losing a primary caregiver at the age are on the brain? There aren't words to describe how strongly you are the asshole in this situation.", "So absent father, who rarely makes the effort to see his kid, thinks he has a right to comment on her appearance?  Get fucked dude.", "I went back and forth for a long time about tattoos for myself. If I got one no one could see then why have it, I thought. But I also worried about it affecting my image as a professional business woman. A few years ago I ended up in the hospital with high blood pressure and chest pains. When I got out I was very angry. So I thought I don\u2019t care what other people think. So I got two. One is on my shoulder and it\u2019s the scales of justice. I believe in social justice and my grandfather was a judge so it works. The other I got on my write opposite side. It\u2019s like a bracelet with musical symbols. It has the word image from the song and my daughter\u2019s name. I don\u2019t have any plans for more at this time.", "that\u2019s pretty irrelevant when in both the locations of OP and the daughter, college is *not free*", "That\u2026.makes the point even more", "Like where ?\nI live in France and post HS education is not free. And depending on what you chose to study it can get very expensive and you gotta take loans.\nThere are scholarships for some students, but it's not free full ride at all.  Also if you miss one class without a paper from a doctor you lose the scholarship.\nLots of students gotta work all summer + part time job during the school year. And it's not easy.", "That\u2019s fair, though if he reimburses her I\u2019ll confess I\u2019m not sure why that\u2019s so bad, beyond the mental hit of \u201cOH GOD WHERE DID MY MONEY GO\u201d. \n\nNow if her bank won\u2019t allow a transaction that big in one go, that\u2019s another story too.  It might be over the limit.", "I live in Canada, unfortunately.  Even the booking fees for tattoos is at minimum $50-100.  You can avoid that with a walk-in, which would be smaller, but generally even quick, promotional tattoos can be expensive.  My artist when I lived in Germany remarked on it, as did my artist when I was living in Ireland (who did my first tattoo).", "That\u2019s probably why then; the artist is probably cutting her a deal.  Lucky!", "That\u2019s what her and her mum have always said. She had a lot of \u201cmental illnesses\u201d and issues when I left but I always thought it was because of her mother.", "Because she said she doesn\u2019t know if she can afford it in one go after she gets paid this week. Rent, bills, food can\u2019t wait until Dad decides to reimburse his half of the cost.", "YTA, YTA, YTA!!! You voicing your opinion on not liking tattoos might be a reason she isn\u2019t jumping through hoops to see you.  I have a sleeve ,and about 10 other tattoos.  I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t give a shit about any of our opinions.  You came here for validation which is very obvious.  \n\nTattoos are an extremely personal thing.  You expressing your dislike for tattoos is like you telling her you disapprove of her, the person she is and the way she expresses herself.  That will forever play in her head every time she talks to you or sees you. Every time her skin is exposed around you she will think about how you don\u2019t see her as beautiful. How do I know this? Because my dad told me the same thing.  It broke my heart.  I will continue to express myself through my tattoos but know, that every time she expresses herself, she will know you love her a little less.  \n\nForget about the damn trip.  You need to right YOUR wrong about her tattoos.  You need to tell her she is beautiful with them.  Open your damn eyes and mind.  You don\u2019t get to tell her she is ugly.  You might not have said those words but that is what she heard.", "Ok. Your not a fan of tattoos. So don\u2019t get any!", "Most likely it\u2019s her shit father", "What a complete AH you are. \nPrepare for her to go No Contact in a few years. I know I would.", "ah yes let\u2019s blame her mom, the one who stayed and cared to her, but not you, the parent who abandoned a preteen and moved to the other side of the globe. yeah i\u2019m sure she has *no issues* from you *at all* lmao", "Gross gross gross. YTA and then some. You\u2019re the absolute last person in the world who should be opining about her body or basically charging her money for your company.", "Tbf, it is somewhat connected as US (where the daughter is) education is very much not free", "\"Mom, I want to visit you for your birthday!\"  \n\"I hate your lifestyle and your choices suck.\"  \nPoor kid. No wonder she moved half a globe away.", "Pretty sure it's not free in Australia where OP is either", "Actually, this is her dad, and HE is the one that moved away.", "This is a very touchy subject in the US right now.    College education is definitely not free here, even public/community college can be prohibitively expensive, and leave a graduate with a ton of debt that they won\u2019t be able to pay for with the wage they\u2019ll make upon graduating.  There is also currently a heated \u2018debate\u2019 regarding student loan forgiveness (in quotes because the GOP will not pass the legislation) is one of the reasons the country is so divided.  It\u2019s a shitshow, really.\n\nThat\u2019s just some background for you.", "Oh holy bajeezus.  \nThat's even worse."]}
