Suddenly, this family jumped the queue and I, being a stickler for queuing, went up to them and requested that they line up like everyone else. The dad told me that they had been here two hours before\u2026but they weren\u2019t even in the line, they were just lounging around! I told them that we arrived in the airport two hours ago as well, and he told me to mind my attitude. I just told him to please go back to the end of the line, at which the tax refund person also told the family to line up.\n\n  \nAfter the couple before us was done, he quickly ran up again and said \u2018Hey we only have one receipt I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t just let us go first\u2019, but I told him it was because he jumped the queue previously. He then grumbled something about us having lots of stuff but\u2026if you really wanted your money so desperately, imho you should have gone to get it three hours before your departure. Afterwards, he complained to the couple at the back of the line with him, and mentioned that he was trying to catch a plane but still\u2026the way he went about trying to get in front left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\n  \nWhen we were done, his family and the couple he talked to started yelling at us to get out of the way with our luggages. The reason we had them was because we had to show the contents of the luggage to the tax refund person. My family said I wasn\u2019t an AH for telling him to get back in line, although I have to admit I was a bit snippy towards the end, but I don\u2019t know because the other couple agreed with him and also were rude to us at the end. Maybe it\u2019s because we had lots of receipts, but that\u2019s what tax return is for, right? They also didn't complain about the couple before us, who had WAY more receipts.

I notice that in most other countries people push, shove and aggressively cut lines and I have noticed this is Europe and Africa. When I\u2019m in another country I go with the flow because I\u2019ve read this is normal in those cultures and not considered rude as they don\u2019t often apologize, they just push past you. But when someone from the U.S. does this I feel angrier because it\u2019s NOT acceptable in our culture and I would be tempted to say something as well.\n\nI hope this does not come off as racist or insensitive towards other cultures. I truly don\u2019t mean it in a negative way, it\u2019s just the 100% honest truth from my observations and from what I\u2019ve read about other cultures. Europe is beautiful and so is Africa and the people are wonderful. Lines just follow different rules. In fact, a student joined my class from Africa the last month of school and she struggled for the first few weeks with lines and other kids thought she was rude. Once she understood, she would hold the door for other kids to come in at recess just to be polite.

Letting somebody go from the back to in front of you would be disrespectful to everyone behind you. If I have a full troley, the person behind me has a full trolley and the person behind them only has what they can carry, I'm not going to invite them to push past the person behind me to get in front of me. \n\nThe other  thing, they didn't ask. That was them being disrespectful to you.  Or entitled. I remember waiting to get in for breakfast at the hotel when I was at Comicon. Restaurant was busy, there was a line, some guy came down ran to the front saying he was a doctor and had a plane to catch.
