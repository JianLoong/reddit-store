When my dad died, Gemma wanted to keep me, but I wanted to be with my grandparents on my mom's side. Gemma had never adopted me, though she had wanted to, and my grandparents took the whole thing to court. Gemma tried to convince me to stay but it was never what I wanted. She was fine, I got along okay with her, but she was never mom. Stepmom, and that was it, but I didn't feel strongly about that title for her either.\n\nI see my half sisters about once a month still but I don't have a very big role in their lives. Their mom has no place in my life anymore. She's engaged to a guy and has his three kids living with them too. She has tried to get me interested in being part of her family but that was never something that I wanted.\n\nMy grandparents are older and both have upcoming surgery that means I will be staying with my uncle and aunt for a few weeks. Gemma found out about it through someone she knows and told my grandparents to send me to her house. My grandparents and I had already talked about where I'd rather go and who would take me. My uncle would so that's what I chose. We had discussed Gemma and I had said no way did I want to stay with them. In theory I could stay on my own too but they wanted me to have adults around. Plus my uncle and aunt are going to help my grandparents when they get out of the hospital.\n\nGemma kept calling and pestering and one day I answered my grandpa's phone, which I have permission to do, when I saw her name and I told her to stop bugging them. She told me she wanted them to let me stay with her family for a while so I could get to know everyone. I told her I knew what she wanted but I didn't want to stay with them and that I had made the choice of where to go. Gemma got upset. Asked me why I hadn't wanted to stay with them. She said she had always hoped the time would come where I would integrate myself back into her family and be her child again. I told her I had never seen her as my parent and had never considered myself her child. She ended the call saying my dad would have been so disappointed in me. That he had wanted me to stay with her and my half sisters (which I know is true, because he had written that) and would hate to see me decide living with extended family was more important. I told her it was what I wanted and had no regrets. She called me cruel then.\n\nAITA for what I said to her?

It's not your fault that she has some fantasy where you all dance around and sing.

Your Dad probably wanted to make sure you had the support of a family, and his wife and kids made sense to him. But you\u2019ve found a wonderful support in your grandparents and your uncle, so you are doing what is best for you. Your Dad would be happy and proud that you are safe and doing well, no matter what. Gemma is awful for trying to make you think otherwise.", "NTA your dad however good his intentions is gone. What you want and are comfortable with is more important. She needs to back of and realise you can\u2019t force being \u2018mom\u2019 when the feelings not reciprocated.

Do not think what I will write now indicates you ought to go back, you can make your own decisions at your age.\n\nHowever: she lost a husband and a young man she considered a son at the same time, and was probably quite traumatised by this. To her, these are probably the two greatest losses she has suffered, and while she can never have your father back, she still hopes to reconnect with you. This is also to some extent true for your half-sisters: you are the link to the father they knew very little of, as they must have been less than 6 years old when your father died. To them, you are the most real link to their biological father, and you are the older brother they probably missed greatly even if they were too small to express if properly when you left.\n\nDo not let her pressure you at a time of stress, but if you find it in your heart to spend a little more time with your sisters, that might be a good deed.", ">She ended the call saying my dad would have been so disappointed in me.\n\nI was firmly in the no assholes camp until this right here.

In theory it is nice that she wants to leave that door open for you to feel included in your half siblings lives if you choose but to continually harass you (and what she is doing does count as harassment) and try to force it will only end up pushing you further away. At this point she has crossed the line from being a caring adult to placing unnecessary stress on you and your grandparents before medical procedures.

It is almost as if you are a surrogate for your father. Not an individual with his own wants and needs. The ignorance in some of these comments is ridiculous he does not and has never thought of her as a mother figure. He has a mother he knew her and loved her before she passed away. Not every child is looking to replace that love/person.

As a widow myself my heart breaks for Gemma. But, she shouldn't have pushed so hard. Also reminding you of how your dad would feel isn't relevant only hurtful.

You are 17, and have the right to stay in an environment where you feel comfortable and safe. (That's true for everyone, not just 17-year-olds ;) ). Your stepmother wants to give you that (which is very nice of her), but also has to accept that that is not possible for you (for whatever reason). What your father wanted does not really matter anymore, because he is no longer there and therefore cannot be there for you. You could have possibly shown a little more respect for your stepmother, but she also for you by accepting your decision.In any case, if she wanted you to integrate back into the family after a while, she has surely now stopped and delayed that process by trying to push you into this.\n\nINFO - Do you also see and talk to your stepmother when you see your half siblings?

You have your grandparents and your aunt and uncle, and that's where you want to be.", "NTA. quite frankly whatever the wish of her dying husband doesn\u2019t matter if that is not what YOU want. I feel for her and she is clearly in a lot of pain still, but that is not an excuse to harass a minor and their family.", "Honest opinion? You\u2019re not her kid, you are just her children\u2019s brother, not her son because you never considered her a mother. I know people are saying for you to spend time with your half siblings but don\u2019t let them influence you on it, that\u2019s your choice in the matter. We are just here to give advice as strangers on the internet. To possibly explain gemma\u2019s behaviour on the matter is kind of simple I suppose, trauma of losing a loved one is soul crushing but that isn\u2019t your burden to carry, it\u2019s not your job to help heal a wound like that. The only way I could really see Gemma recovering possibly from that is to go to therapy and address her problems that way rather then trying to force something that just isn\u2019t there. Your grandparents are wonderful people and so are your aunt and uncle, I wish them a swift and safe recovery. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At the very least, authorities need to know this is happening.", "Agreed, I think OP might\u2019ve been able to handle it because they clearly stated their feelings and then Gemma turns around and tells him how disappointed his dead father would be.
