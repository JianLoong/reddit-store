His (21f) fianc\u00e9 recently told my parents she wanted to move in here instead of living where they planned to move. I (30F), my (33m) husband and daughter currently live with my parents. I told them that if they were to allow my brothers fianc\u00e9 to move I will be moving out. This has caused major issues with my mom who was upset at me for wanting to move out. A little backstory; when I got married five years ago I moved out and lived with my husband. When we had our first child a year ago I got really sick and am unable to have any more children. Due to pressure of both my mom and husband I quiet my full time well paying job to be a stay at home mom so I could fully enjoy raising my only child. The only way we would be able to do this was moving in with my parents. I carry my weight in the home cooking each night and making sure all common areas of the home are clean. My brother is your typical spoiled baby of the family. He has two chores in the home and doesn\u2019t clean. Does not partake in keeping any of the common areas or bathrooms clean. I have been fed up many times and have voiced this to my parents. Instead of my parents talking with him they do it themselves. We would also be sharing one bathroom between my family of 3 (occasionally 5 when my husbands children are with us) my brother, and his fianc\u00e9. That is 7 people to one bathroom. I told my parents I will be moving out as it\u2019s very inconsiderate of me. I told them I understand it is their home however I have to do all the cooking and cleaning in the home and this is only adding on more stress to myself. I also recently started working a night job so we could tackle some of the debt we incurred while going through our medical issues. I was really looking forward to giving my daughter a room so my husband and I could enjoy a room without a toddler. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 initially were supposed to move in with her grandmother where they would have the master bedroom with their own bathroom. She states she doesn\u2019t want to live there because she feels unwelcome. I am upset because they have options and unlike them I have no where else to go. They can afford to rent their own apartment whereas my husband and I currently cannot. And if they didn\u2019t wish to rent their own place they are able to live with her grandmother. I feel like if your old enough to make the decision to get married then you can go out and live on your own. Especially since I am only here because I fell on unavoidable hard times. AITAH for telling my parents if my brothers fianc\u00e9 moves in that I\u2019ll go back to working full time and move out?\n\nETA: My husband works full time and helps with the house and kids. We are deep into debt because when I gave birth I got extremely sick. I was in a coma, on a ventilator, and my husband had already said goodbye to me when my health turned around and I got better. I came home very sick. Unable to walk, on many medications and injections. We went from into debt from it all.\n\nWe agreed to move into my parents home because Even if I quit my job we could afford to pay off our medical debt. My parents later said we needed to pay a portion of rent and a portion of utilities. I get that however I had a plan to pay off all debt and since that was now I\u2019m play I got a night job. Daycare costs in my areas are about $1,000-1,400 so it\u2019s easier for my husband to work this so we can care for her while the other is working.\n\nI can afford to move out if I just file bankruptcy and kiss my medical debt goodbye .", "created_utc": 1686117871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14351au/aita_for_threatening_to_move_out_if_brothers/", "score": 354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s her parents\u2019.

She should definitely have a voice in it- but she also already knows how her parents treat/prioritize/enable her brother, she is continually putting herself in a degrading situation and allowing herself and her family to be second rate. It seems her mother and husband (ew) have almost forced incompetence by encouraging leaving her previous job and being a SAHM, but all the same OP can only voice issue, not control who does or doesn\u2019t live there. OP knowing she\u2019d be taking more responsibility and being used is somewhat frustrating all around- to those using her and her continuing to allow it.

If your medical bills are so large, you should probably do the bankruptcy filing regardless of the living conditions being strenuous. If my husband and I could afford it, we wouldn't be living with my family either, but even without debt, we cannot afford to rent a 1 bedroom right now, and we have 2 kids 7 years apart. Your parents and brother need to start taking care of their own stuff and not put it all on you.", "Broadly NTA.\n\nThe way this reads I am not sure you've communicated the situation as politely as you could have. I'm also not sure you haven't. It sounds like your wants/plans are perfectly reasonable in the situation.\n\nObviously GF isn't going to get brother to contribute to the home. Is GF likely to contribute to the home? Clean/cook/pay enough rent that your rent would go down? I wouldn't bet on it even if it were implied she would.\n\nOtOH, it looks like all the options suck. So maybe take the less sucky option and move out?\n\nOn the other hand, you can always move out later, so IDK that you have anything to lose by not giving it a try. Although, IDK how long searching for an apartment will take, so you might have a defacto trial anyway.\n\nElse. Ok, this sucks. But a medical divorce might help. Instead of you both filing for bankruptcy.", "She\u2019s basically working as a maid, and a chef and paying them for the privilege!", "There's a slight amount of leeway when you almost die so hard that you have to move back in with your parents just to be able to scrape by. She did go out and live separately from her parents, these two want to start off in the nest so they have a maid and cook.", "I disagree. If they are single and living with their parents while looking for a job it\u2019s fine. But they should wait to get married until they are able to support themselves.", "It's perfectly acceptable for a SINGLE person that age to live with their parents. Deciding to start a married life is a next step that shouldn't involve your parents house in any way. Brother might be getting more sympathy if he got married, moved out, then had to move back in after his wife told him goodbye as he literally lay dying. But that's not his situation, it's hers.", "You have a say about who moves in when you are a paying tenant.\n\nAlso, when you're going to have another person to clean up after", "I think you missed the part where I explained my living situation. I was on my deathbed after having my daughter, my husband was told to say good bye to me. My daughter was discharged home to my in-laws. I had to go to therapy just to be able to walk again. This put us in a lot of debt. We were living a very different life before me giving birth.", "She has a job, and her husband isn't part of the problem. Why would divorce even be an idea? He may have helped convince her to quit her original job and move with her parents, but I have a feeling his intent was for her wellbeing after being in a coma and almost dying. Her family are the ones taking advantage.", "He works full-time to pay rent and utilities to the parents.  It sounds like he has kids from previous relationship, so probably paying child support.  OP works nights to pay medical debt.", "That's why I am asking OP to get more clarification."]}
