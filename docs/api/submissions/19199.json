{"id": 19199, "submission_id": "14351au", "title": "AITA for threatening to move out if brothers fianc\u00e9 moves in?", "selftext": "My (22m) brother is getting married soon. His (21f) fianc\u00e9 recently told my parents she wanted to move in here instead of living where they planned to move. I (30F), my (33m) husband and daughter currently live with my parents. I told them that if they were to allow my brothers fianc\u00e9 to move I will be moving out. This has caused major issues with my mom who was upset at me for wanting to move out. A little backstory; when I got married five years ago I moved out and lived with my husband. When we had our first child a year ago I got really sick and am unable to have any more children. Due to pressure of both my mom and husband I quiet my full time well paying job to be a stay at home mom so I could fully enjoy raising my only child. The only way we would be able to do this was moving in with my parents. I carry my weight in the home cooking each night and making sure all common areas of the home are clean. My brother is your typical spoiled baby of the family. He has two chores in the home and doesn\u2019t clean. Does not partake in keeping any of the common areas or bathrooms clean. I have been fed up many times and have voiced this to my parents. Instead of my parents talking with him they do it themselves. We would also be sharing one bathroom between my family of 3 (occasionally 5 when my husbands children are with us) my brother, and his fianc\u00e9. That is 7 people to one bathroom. I told my parents I will be moving out as it\u2019s very inconsiderate of me. I told them I understand it is their home however I have to do all the cooking and cleaning in the home and this is only adding on more stress to myself. I also recently started working a night job so we could tackle some of the debt we incurred while going through our medical issues. I was really looking forward to giving my daughter a room so my husband and I could enjoy a room without a toddler. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 initially were supposed to move in with her grandmother where they would have the master bedroom with their own bathroom. She states she doesn\u2019t want to live there because she feels unwelcome. I am upset because they have options and unlike them I have no where else to go. They can afford to rent their own apartment whereas my husband and I currently cannot. And if they didn\u2019t wish to rent their own place they are able to live with her grandmother. I feel like if your old enough to make the decision to get married then you can go out and live on your own. Especially since I am only here because I fell on unavoidable hard times.

I already don't like that your husband doesn't make enough to care for you but forced you to quit your job. Update us okay? I am also very sorry and maybe you need people who won't pressure you to quit something you love/that gave you independence. I don't like your husband or parents tbh. Be careful. I'm not sure your husband actually cares for you if he tried to control you by making you quit a good job that made you independent of him. You're life isnt over and you can start again--you need a break ( perhaps permanently) from all these people. Ask yourself if you're truly happy?", "NTA.\n\nBased on the title I was prepared to say the opposite but it seems like you're doing a lot- paying rent, utilities, food, and doing all of the domestic work while caring for a child.

Everyone as adults gets to decide what works for them and this doesn't really sound like it is working for you.  Your daughter is getting older and probably would enjoy being in daycare and having other kids to play with.  I get wanting to focus on her, but you can still be a great mother working and being in a better mental place because you are in your own space and responsible only for your immediate family and not a host of other people.", "NTA \n\nSix adults & a child in one house is a lot unless it\u2019s larger house with 3+ bedrooms.\n\nI can understand your parents & husband encouraging you to take time off after childbirth if the delivery was complicated & you were ill for a while. But if you\u2019re well enough to work & want to go back, why would they want you to stay at home? If you & husband are paying most of the household bills & doing most of the cleaning while brother isn\u2019t expected to do anything, that\u2019s a red flag.", "ESH \n\nYou --- not your home, not your call.
