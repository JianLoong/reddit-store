{"id": 19199, "submission_id": "14351au", "title": "AITA for threatening to move out if brothers fianc\u00e9 moves in?", "selftext": "My (22m) brother is getting married soon. His (21f) fianc\u00e9 recently told my parents she wanted to move in here instead of living where they planned to move. I (30F), my (33m) husband and daughter currently live with my parents. I told them that if they were to allow my brothers fianc\u00e9 to move I will be moving out. This has caused major issues with my mom who was upset at me for wanting to move out. A little backstory; when I got married five years ago I moved out and lived with my husband. When we had our first child a year ago I got really sick and am unable to have any more children. Due to pressure of both my mom and husband I quiet my full time well paying job to be a stay at home mom so I could fully enjoy raising my only child. The only way we would be able to do this was moving in with my parents. I carry my weight in the home cooking each night and making sure all common areas of the home are clean. My brother is your typical spoiled baby of the family. He has two chores in the home and doesn\u2019t clean. Does not partake in keeping any of the common areas or bathrooms clean. I have been fed up many times and have voiced this to my parents. Instead of my parents talking with him they do it themselves. We would also be sharing one bathroom between my family of 3 (occasionally 5 when my husbands children are with us) my brother, and his fianc\u00e9. That is 7 people to one bathroom. I told my parents I will be moving out as it\u2019s very inconsiderate of me. I told them I understand it is their home however I have to do all the cooking and cleaning in the home and this is only adding on more stress to myself. I also recently started working a night job so we could tackle some of the debt we incurred while going through our medical issues. I was really looking forward to giving my daughter a room so my husband and I could enjoy a room without a toddler. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 initially were supposed to move in with her grandmother where they would have the master bedroom with their own bathroom. She states she doesn\u2019t want to live there because she feels unwelcome. I am upset because they have options and unlike them I have no where else to go. They can afford to rent their own apartment whereas my husband and I currently cannot. And if they didn\u2019t wish to rent their own place they are able to live with her grandmother. I feel like if your old enough to make the decision to get married then you can go out and live on your own. Especially since I am only here because I fell on unavoidable hard times.

However, hopefully it is already viable because if the parents decide to allow the fianc\u00e9e to move in and OP doesn\u2019t make the move, it\u2019ll be a low blow and I imagine treatment (or rather, mistreatment) will only get worse.  On the other hand, despite the fact OP does pay for a lot and does the majority of household management and operations, it ultimately is not her ownership- everyone saying it \u201cmight as well be her home\u201d but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s her parents\u2019. Maybe I\u2019m reading it differently but when she added in her comment the job is to pay her parents and not just to help lower medical debt, to me that sounds like them paying rent is OP paying to her parents, not that she and hubs pay the entirety of rent/mortgage that her parents potentially owe. She should definitely have a voice in it- but she also already knows how her parents treat/prioritize/enable her brother, she is continually putting herself in a degrading situation and allowing herself and her family to be second rate. It seems her mother and husband (ew) have almost forced incompetence by encouraging leaving her previous job and being a SAHM, but all the same OP can only voice issue, not control who does or doesn\u2019t live there. OP knowing she\u2019d be taking more responsibility and being used is somewhat frustrating all around- to those using her and her continuing to allow it.
