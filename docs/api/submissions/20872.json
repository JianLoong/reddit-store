I don\u2019t want a big dinner with my family on my birthday night, I\u2019d rather be having fun with my friends.\n\nFurther, they got in a car wreck while driving me to the hotel (everybody\u2019s okay) so I\u2019m spending my 19th birthday stuck standing on the side of the road. I didn\u2019t want them to come, I didn\u2019t want them to nag me into spending my night with them, I didn\u2019t want to spend my birthday standing at the side of a car wreck and then eating dinner with them.\n\nThe irony of this situation is, there is actually something I wanted as a gift for my birthday which was $300. This isn\u2019t a lot to my family, but they said they couldn\u2019t afford it because they spent lots of money on plane tickets. They said they didn\u2019t have money for something I wanted, but had enough to buy three plane tickets ti visit when I don\u2019t want them to. If they just didn\u2019t have money to get me something, fine, I don\u2019t mind. But if they\u2019re actively going out of their way to spend money on something that I don\u2019t want and will ruin my night and then saying they no longer have money, that\u2019s just infuriating to me. It\u2019s not about the money or the present itself, it\u2019s the fact they spent so much money just to make my birthday worse.\n\nI told them, when my mom asked why I was being so cranky, that I had plans with my friends I had to cancel and that I frankly didn\u2019t want them there. She got upset and said my family just wanted to see me and just wanted to feed me. I pointed out they only talked about what they wanted and asked if they even thought about what I wanted.\n\nThis caused my mom to start crying, and my dad got angry and called me an AH and ungrateful.
