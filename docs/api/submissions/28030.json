He didn't really see anything wrong with it so he told me what he was doing. My little brother (13 m) has ADD and my father suspected he wasn't actually doing his homework, instead wasting his time while being distracted. So my dad figured it'd be a good idea to secretly record him while he was doing his homework. I went downstairs, and my brother was there too. Since I thought it was kinda weird my dad was recording him, I told my brother. He was weirded out and told me he'd noticed a flashlight. He went upstairs to confront my dad, who came down to scold me, saying he needed to record him because it was a parent's duty to make sure he actually did his homework. I think it's kinda weird he got mad because if he didn't see a problem with recording my brother, why did he have a problem with me telling him? I don't think I'm the asshole bc I think my brother deserves to know, but I'm not entirely sure.

That's seriously invasive and a bit concerning", "Yea, my brother has a glass pane above his door and I don't, so when my dad said he hadn't needed to record me yet I said he couldn't record me, to which he answered he'd figure something out. Creeps me out tbh. He tried to have a camera in the living room too but my mom shut down that plan.", "Exactly what I was going to say, NTA.  Pretty bad piece of parenting right there.", "Or, just check to see if he has completed it.  So easy\u2026", "It is VERY unlikely dad is interested in the homework.

This is controlling at best...and something *very bad* at worst.", "If I were you, I\u2019d check my room (and probably also shared spaces like kitchen and bathroom) for cameras. One trick I read somewhere is to turn off the light, turn on your phone\u2019s camera and look around with that, because a camera would glow red on the phone screen.
