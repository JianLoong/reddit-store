I hate to say it, darling, but fir your own sanity you may need to take a break from mom for a bit.  That's where so much of your stress is coming from!   You obviously love your mother and I'd never say go no contact with someone, yet I bet some time off from her would be soothing to your soul.  You say you want to stand up for yourself...well this is one way to do it!  Boundaries for her behavior!   Even feel free to rell her...text if necessary...and say that your feelings are hurt and you need some time away from her for a while and that you'll contact her when you're ready.

This is not her wedding & she gets no say in the dress.  The only person who has a say in the dress is you.  You didn't go  behind her back, you went to look for a dress that you would like & not have your mother's opinion's involved.  Your mom seems to think she is the wedding planner.  This is where you also need to put your foot down.  She needs to stop trying to have any involvement in planning your wedding.

Take away any collateral she has over the wedding and then you\u2019re free to plan as you wish.\n\nMy wife and I had our wedding during peak covid times, so we had to be ruthless with the guest list.
