If he can\u2019t see, it\u2019s not there, right? And lease is up soon and he will leave and the debt to you guys will noy be his problem anymore. \n\nMy guess is he have aldready started taking quick loans and because he feels/knows he\u2019s in a hopeless situation, his mental strategy is something along the lines of \u201cfuck it if I owe 5000 or 8000, might as well have some fun anyway\u201d. It pretty common in people who are work up debt, kind of like, if you\u2019re going to hell, might as well arrive in style. \n\nYou can try to help him see this but don\u2019t expect that money back.

He has done nothing to try to settle it. Text him and give him a time frame for when he has to pay you back, and if he doesn't, tell him you'll take him to small claims court. If he owes other people money too, then it's a pattern of behavior. He's not your responsibility. Also in the future, you should pay your rent separately to your landlord so it can't get skimmed. Then if a portion is missing, the landlord will hopefully take it out on that person, not all of you - depending on what your lease is like.\n\nUnfortunately you're just going to have to deal with the tension with Carl until your lease comes up and you can get away from him.

So they cannot really contribute but I'm just happy they can sustain themselves and can budget. \n\nIn terms of others in the frat, he owes about 3 other brothers money. Not as much as me but he still owes them each like over $300. I was not made aware of this until after the fact. \n\nWe have discussed our concerns with Carl. Because our lease is up by the end of July, we've told him how we're concerned that \n1) these debts wouldnt be paid and it's truly unjust. \n2) that this is a habit he cannot break.

So you're saying you all paid Carl for February rent and he stole it and didn't give it to the landlord. So you fronted the money and now he owes you. \n\nHe STOLE your RENT MONEY. This is pretty damn serious. He could have gotten you all evicted and he's just.... Mad his dad knows??", "NTA but Carl really is. You need to have a serious talk with him. He\u2019s really treating you badly and how dare he go to Las Vegas while owing you that much money? He and his father should be ashamed of him and dad should pay you back and deduct some funds from each time he sends his son money.", "NTA. Kick him out and sue him in small claims court for the $1500. fuck being nice. Dude is a 27 year old loser leeching off of young college students.", "NTA\n\nBut you were foolish to pay his part of rent AFTER he stole from 3 of you. And then it sounds like you paid his share of rent AGAIN? To bring it from $1500 to $2000.\n\nSounds like he's fooled you three times.\n\nHe's never giving you the money back, hopefully this should be a good (expensive) lesson for you, never lend more than you are willing to give.\n\nAlso you need to kick him out, and have him kicked out of the frat too.", "You need to talk talk to landlord, explain how you guys pay rent, and that y\u2019all had no clue about the missing rent until she told you. Given that you\u2019ve taken care of it and she\u2019s paid in full, you\u2019re still having issues with one roommate and would like to evict him and find someone new. Ask what I\u2019m that process she needs to be in on and go about it legally. \n\nTell Carl you can\u2019t trust him and he\u2019s being kicked out. See if other roommate can help cover part of the rent until y\u2019all can find someone else to move in. It sucks that you need to ask other roommate to help cover a portion but let them know that while Carl is still living there, he\u2019s not paying his portion and if y\u2019all wanna stay there, you need to stand together on this to get him gone but you can\u2019t keep covering Carls rent alone. Make sure as soon as Carl is out, locks are changed.", "NTA.  Also, take this as a lesson: Never lend money you can't afford to lose.", "What did his dad say?", "NTA. In fact KICK HIM TO THE CURB. Your friendship came at the cost of $1460.", "Nta. You never loans people money it always goes wrong", "NTA- So you learned about the money issue after the fact. Strike one. He's given you BS repayment plans that he never pulls through on. Strike Two. He went to VEGAS in may. STRIKE 3. \n\nAnd you say Daddy Carl is part of the Frat? Why would you not inform him?", "NTA. You exhausted all other options and he didn't show you or the debt the respect their owed.", "NTA. Hell, I would be on my roommates ass for a few hundred. Shit\u2019s expensive these days, and 2 grand isn\u2019t something to scoff at. Honestly, I don\u2019t blame you for being pissed at him after going on a trip. I would have been livid.\n\nSide note? What have the roommates done to help? They are just as responsible and it\u2019s unfair for them to put all the responsibility on you. Tell your roommate you will no longer foot his bill and if he can\u2019t pay it on time then he will take the late fees since it\u2019s his fault they don\u2019t have the full amount paid. At this point you might need to consider whether living with them is worth it.", "Welcome to having college roommates. Let this be a life lesson to NEVER be on the hook for someone else's bills like that. Do whatever you can to arrange for separate payments/leases. It's not always possible, but it's worth a strong effort.", "ESH accept the dad. \n\nUnless the father is a guarantee for his son the the father is in no way involved. Carl is 27. He's a full adult whose father is in no way responsible for his actions anymore. Telling his father was your attempt at putting a responsibility on his father and I don't think that's fair to the father. If you default on your mortgage a bank doesn't call up and harrass your relatives. You did this in the hope that either the father would pay the debt or that the father would apply pressure to Carl to pay. Either way you were trying to coerce an action from an unrelated third party and that's not fair to that unrelated third party.\n\nNow Carl is a complete AH as he needs to pay his rent. End of story. Full stop. Completely wrong.\n\nYou're an adult. You have options for moving forward. Personally I think eviction and filing for the rent in a civil court is the most appropriate but you will need to discuss with your other roommates. Don't contact his father or any other relative again, there are laws to protect third parties from being harassed over relatives debt.", "Carl is the one who needs to grow up and pay his debts like an adult.", "This is all I could focus on hahah. Bro is almost 30 rocking a frat house.", "these are bendy and I get them in the 100' roll.  The old timers still call them drain tile from when they were baked clay", "NTA.  Carl is obviously not planning to pay you back, despite repeated requests.  Good luck.", "Take him to court\u2026", "NTA.  From the title I was ready to castigate you for going to his dad - but this isn't even a debt that you agreed to.  I mean, you did agree to make up the overdue rent as a loan, but you didn't agree to the money not going to rent in the first place.  You're not going to get that money back any other way.", "NTA. If you set a deadline and he's got money for other recreational activities, that means he doesn't respect you enough to pay you.  I had a \"friend\" who was in charge of distributing the fantasy football winnings the year I won. Him and I don't really get along.  I message him 3 weeks after the season ended asking about the winnings. He said he was going to send it. Two weeks go by and I ask the second place winner if he got his money, he said he did.  So I posted in the FF chat asking if everybody else who won got their winnings.  The guy in charge of the money was livid. Called me and said I was an asshole for embarrassing him.  Point is he didn't respect me enough to send me the money so why should I respect him.", "NTA\n\nThis is verging into theft, if you were paying him and he wasn't paying that into rent, where was it going?  IF he was just constantly short but ran up this much, that's bad but at least not theft.  Get the money paid back, document everything you have paid in for the rent, and if it comes to an issue make sure you're not the one with issues on your credit report.  Get the money from his dad if you can at this point, don't live with him again (obviously), and take this as a valuable lesson about roommates.", "Wait. Just so I\u2019m clear - you all paid him rent, he didn\u2019t pay it and then you bailed him out. \n\nMy dude, so NTA. He\u2019s lucky he isn\u2019t facing charges but for the love of God, never bail someone out like this again. They will do you over again and again", "Damn.", "Who could blame you?!", "I had an 18 year old roommate my first semester of college after the military. I was 27. We got along, but didn\u2019t socialize. I think I saved him from some stupid mistakes by offering advice. Saw him again 20 years later. He thanked me for the advice. He was a family physician and I was a patient.", ">He plans to move to NYC after graduation in December\n\nYup. Wants he goes to NYC, he's blocking OP, and everyone he owes money to.", "Yeah. Like, why is he only avoiding OP?", "OP isn\u2019t answering that question. \ud83e\udd14", "OP what was his fathers response to you?", "I\u2019m guessing Dad didn\u2019t pay them. What a mess.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s a bit odd \ud83d\ude41", "Or paid for his trip to Vegas. He may be a gambler--he's not 22, he's 27. He has a lot more backstory than most college seniors. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I graduated from college at 26 myself.", "And it was \ud83d\ude01", "Right? But then I noticed that some of these conversations were 8 or 9 hours ago. Maybe he hasn\u2019t seen them . . ? In any case, I\u2019m guessing OP definitely didn\u2019t get the money and perhaps Carl Sr. was a dick about it.", "Not if his dad is \u201cpart of the fraternity.\u201d OP, you\u2019re NTA. Did the dad pay you?", "Eh, I commented this when I scrolled past older comments that asked the same thing and he skipped those, but responded to more recently posted comments\u2026 so I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m just curious tbf haha", "NTA.  Not a fan of Greek life, but his Dad being a frat brother makes it even more important that you get paid.  If you don\u2019t, get the frat President involved.", "NTA this is growing up man. Carl gave you a middle finger when he went to vegas", "He STOLE your money! This is bigger than not having his share of the rent. NTA", "You never lent it in the first place! He stole it!", "Strategically Transferring Equipment to an Alternative Location -ing. Age-old tradition.", "Then why do you continue to accept the unacceptable reasoning he\u2019s given by saying nothing when he continues to go out multiple times per month to spend the money he owes you and your other brothers?\n\nThat\u2019s not \u201cself-care\u201d. That is only selfish and greedy on his part.", "Ah, gotta love a Ponzi.", "Totally off topic, but this post just made me realize that in today's social hierarchy among you adults, frat boys occupy a space very similar to that of the one inhabited 'nerds' in the 80's and 90's. Weird.\n\nNTA", "I'm surprised at all the N T A judgements. OP, Carl is a grown ass man. His father is no longer responsible for him and his debts. He doesn't care that his son owes someone money and it's not his responsiblity to give it to you. You're basically pulling a debt collector and calling and harassing family members because you made the risk of trusting a housemate with your money instead of paying it to the real estate directly. \n\n  \nYTA OP, leave his father the fuck alone and deal with this with Carl directly, if he's not co-operating, take it to small claims.", "you guys should get away from paying all together and y\u2019all should pay the landlord individually, that way if it comes to eviction it\u2019s just \u201cCarl\u201d and not everybody", "Bro, he's just learning embezzlement for his future career in finance.", "NTA. Carl didn't want to pay it and got mad when he got called out. He could've avoided that by keeping up with his responsibility of paying his rent share.", ">Currently, I am owed over $1500 due to him being unable to pay his portion of rent. Carl does theater\n\n>So i contact Carl's dad about the situation and my concerns that i will not be repaid\n\nLooks like Carl is already living up to the theater lifestyle... NTA", "Carl went to Vegas? That raises all manner of red flags as to where his rent $$ has been going.", "Clearly everyone on this sub is, because honestly, if I had a 27 year old with money issues, I wouldn't want his creditors calling me. He's a grown man, it's his issue. Don't bother me with that shit.", "If he can't pay his bills he can't pay his tuition- so its possible his dad might be paying that.", "And mooching off them....", "At 19 i had raging house parties and a dirty dish stack probably taller than my head\n\nAt 29 I'd get annoyed if there was dishes that we're left overnight and had people over for board games \n\n\nAbsolutely would not live with a 19 year old. For any reason", "I wouldn't blame the dad for not wanting to deal with his son's mess since Carl is 27 years old."]}
