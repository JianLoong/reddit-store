If he can\u2019t see, it\u2019s not there, right? And lease is up soon and he will leave and the debt to you guys will noy be his problem anymore. \n\nMy guess is he have aldready started taking quick loans and because he feels/knows he\u2019s in a hopeless situation, his mental strategy is something along the lines of \u201cfuck it if I owe 5000 or 8000, might as well have some fun anyway\u201d. It pretty common in people who are work up debt, kind of like, if you\u2019re going to hell, might as well arrive in style. \n\nYou can try to help him see this but don\u2019t expect that money back.

He has done nothing to try to settle it. Text him and give him a time frame for when he has to pay you back, and if he doesn't, tell him you'll take him to small claims court. If he owes other people money too, then it's a pattern of behavior. He's not your responsibility. Also in the future, you should pay your rent separately to your landlord so it can't get skimmed. Then if a portion is missing, the landlord will hopefully take it out on that person, not all of you - depending on what your lease is like.\n\nUnfortunately you're just going to have to deal with the tension with Carl until your lease comes up and you can get away from him.

So they cannot really contribute but I'm just happy they can sustain themselves and can budget. \n\nIn terms of others in the frat, he owes about 3 other brothers money. Not as much as me but he still owes them each like over $300. I was not made aware of this until after the fact. \n\nWe have discussed our concerns with Carl. Because our lease is up by the end of July, we've told him how we're concerned that \n1) these debts wouldnt be paid and it's truly unjust. \n2) that this is a habit he cannot break.

One of the new joes tried this and when their supervisor found out, there was a come to Jesus talk with severe repercussions if it didn\u2019t get fixed asap.", "He's not going to do well in NYC if he thinks that rent is optional. He'll be on the street or on his way home in less than six months. And let me get this straight: the other roommates paid him their portions, and he only paid a tiny part of the rent? That means he stole that rent money. He's a thief. I can't imagine that the fraternity allows thieves to be members, especially when they stole from their brothers. It makes them all look bad.", ">He plans to move to NYC after graduation in December\n\nThat gives him another 6 months to borrow money he isn't going to repay. NTA but why are you being so soft on him?", "I would recommend you each sending him a certified letter in writing about the debt he owes you and demanding repayment by a certain date.\n\n1 - It makes it clear you're serious about getting repaid.  That might be the wakeup call he needs to change his priorities and start making payments to you.\n\n2 - It's the first step so that you can file in small claims court.  You'll want to do that before he moves or and vanishes without leaving a forwarding address.   He doesn't have the money to pay you right now, but the judgment in your favor will be on record so if he gets a real job in the future you can force him to pay you back.", "Hope you guys know that he\u2019s not planning on paying anyone. If the lease is up in a month and a half he is just relying on your guys good nature/ naivety and he will just dip without paying anyone. \n\nAlso, youguys ever figure out why rent wasn\u2019t paid in the first place? Everyone seems to have glossed over the fact that he took rent money from 3 people and then spent it on whatever the fuck he wanted? You and your brothers need to band together and get your money. All paid in full. He is choosing NOT to work- he has zero accountability. Unfortunate, but good life lesson to learn.", "It sounds like your problem is you have not really laid down the law with this guy.  It doesn't sound like you've actually given him any concrete deadlines or payment plan options.  You're just sort of being nice to him and not setting down terms.  You just keep asking him to pay you back.\n\nWhat I would do is sit down IN PERSON and lay it down with him, probably including your other frat brothers.\n\nOption 1 - He pays you back in full in 30 Days.  He can borrow money from dad, work more shifts, sell some stuff, live off peanut butter and jelly and ramen for a month if he needs to.\n\nOption 2 - You agree to a payment plan that he will adhere to.  You can decide if you want to charge him interest.\n\nBoth Option 1 and Option 2 need to be a SIGNED DOCUMENT that he will agree to.\n\nOption 3 -  You sue him in small claims court to recover your money.  If he agrees to Option 1 or 2 and he fails to pay on time, Option 3 is what happens.\n\nWhatever he agrees to or doesn't agree to, no way would I continue to live with this guy.", "I wouldn't be surprised if he's just stopped paying you & is saving for his NYC move. It's not like you're going to do anything to him if he can't pay & it sounds like you're now letting him live for free. And all he has to do is avoid you lol. You might wanna consider that he's not really your brother in any sense of the word", "It sounds like he planned on graduating and then not paying you back.", ">I am owed over $1500\n\nThat sounds like it was for covering the money from February + covering his rent after that. Shouldn't it be more? I'm guessing you all gave money to him for rent in February and he only paid $150 of it. What did he do with everyone's rent money? Make sure that doesn't fall through the cracks and you get the full amount back. NTA.", "Is it like a graduate fraternity or something? I\u2019m just ignorant to how all that works and now I\u2019m curious lol. \n\nAlso NTA in terms of judgment. I hope you get your money back soon and maybe try to find a different roommate?", "Nah dude, that\u2019s like call the cops wrong. He literally stole all of y\u2019all\u2019s rent money and DIDNT TELL YOU. Then when you guys come to find out youre just like \u201cIt\u2019s fine buddy, no problem, take your time\u201d If I was convinced to not involve law enforcement I would literally be asking him every single day if he\u2019s made progress. He gets mad??? WELL YOU SHOULDNT HAVE STOLEN THE MONEY. Bro I\u2019d keep calling his fucking dad. That shit is disgraceful.", "He didn't just make you liable for unpaid rent, he knowingly stole from you when he didn't pay after you paid him.  Has an acceptable reason been discovered for why he did this?", "I'm still confused where the money you all gave him went. If I'm understanding correctly the total rent for y'alls apartment is $1150, split three ways that would be \\~$383 each (you don't say how many of you live there so I'm assuming 1 per bedroom), but your landlord said they only receive $150 from you last month which is less than even a third. \n\nSo did you all give him your portions of rent and he just pocketed it? Or did no one pay and now Carl is getting the blame for it because he was in charge of submitting the payment? If the issue was just him not being able to cover his portion then what happened to the money you all gave him to pay the rent in Feburary?", "NTA but he\u2019s not gonna pay you back.", "> There's a lot of people coming from tough circumstances who don't know any better but a few years of frontier justice and most straighten out or get Dishonorably Discharged.\n\nMaybe that's your experience, but it certainly wasn't mine. Theft was an omni-present issue. Anything that wasn't locked up got stolen eventually. Sure, some people would get caught, but they apparently didn't catch nearly enough people.", "> There\u2019s a difference between stealing someone\u2019s donkey dick for packout\n\nNo i refuse. I'm not going to type that into a search engine.", "Yeah the kicker isn't that Carl owes money and it's a lot to several people, it's \"where the fuck did rent go Carl? Why didn't you pay rent in February and fuck with my home, safety, and money? Get your shit together last week Carl. You're out, and I'm taking you to court.\"\n\nHe straight up failed to pay rent with other people's money or tell anyone. I wouldn't trust him to clean my house let alone live in it.", "Because they are doing the fraternity meeting thing where they are pretending to be adults but not really sure how to be\u2026\n\nMaking lists for Carl or whatever. I would be more interested to know the response from dad.", "The frat and the apartment have nothing to do with each other it seems. I would guess OP is an alumni of the frat and the roommates are either current members or also alumni. They know each other through the frat but their housing is not being supplied or overseen by the frat.", "So for my frat, which is a Multicultural frat (not the stereotypical ones you see with big houses and such. We're closer to D9 frats than the other ones.) \n\nWe all joined in Undergrad and some people have moved. I only stayed cause a job in Finance and decided to live with roommates to save more money (so much for that lmao)", "I have a reason. Just not an acceptable one", "Yes you're correct. $1150 total. We historically sent him our own portions for that amount. But in February, after we gave him that money, he only paid $150. Idk where the rest is tbh. I was too livid to ask", "I don\u2019t want him to swallow the debt, in fact, I think he should sue for his money. \n\nNo reason to bring others into a situation that doesn\u2019t involve them.", "The thing that goes on a gas can for fueling up a truck. I thought it would be amusing to use that name for it.", "You are a wiser man than I was\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74", "Right on the nail", "Actually, OP contacting his father (especially since OP mentioned Carl talks highly of him), was quite ok the considerate side. If that works, maybe they could work something out without all the court troubles, and even get Carl some professional help."]}
