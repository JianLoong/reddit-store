We live in a 3x3. Originally, one of our brothers, Carl (27m, not real name), was in charge of paying the rent every month. We would send him our share of the rent and he would pay our landlord (f) in full. \n\nBack in February, I was approved for the Bilt card, which prides itself in giving points and waiving fees for paying rent. I asked Carl if i could take over the rent from there on and he agreed. That same day, he also asked me if I could speak with him and the other roommates that afternoon. Weird but i said i can be there. \n\nI come to pay for March's rent and the landlord makes a groupchat with all of us and states: \"Thank you for your payment of $1150. Last month, i had only received a payment of $150. There is a late fee of $50 so I would still be owed $1050 for February. I will take that $1050 from the payment recently made, and apply the excess $100 for March's rent. For March I would still need $1050 for rent. Be sure this is paid before the 5th to avoid the late fee!\" \n\nAfter receiving this message, i was immediately called by my roommate. I spoke with him on the phone and at home. I voiced my feelings of distrust and concern because I would've assumed he could come to us, his brothers. The household spoke with him as well. Reluctantly, I fronted the money, but told Carl \"You owe me. And I'm not saying pay me back in full in a week but please place some effort into repaying me.\" \n\nCurrently, I am owed over $1500 due to him being unable to pay his portion of rent. Carl does theater and has many practices (this is his major). But due to these practices, he has apparently cut hours while at work these past months. I was only made aware of this by one of our other roommates, who works with Carl and was asked to cover multiple shifts. Carl also goes out with friends 1-2 times a month. \nI'm all for enjoying life and treating yourself, but it does feel wrong to me that he goes out when he could save money to pay off his debts or have his responsibilities in line. \n\nAbout once a week since this began, I've spoken with him about how is it going and how is making money coming along since I've only been paid $40 back for everything he owes me as of late. His plan has mostly revolved around trying to get loans or financial aid, but plans never seem to fall through. \n\nMy final straw was when he went to Las Vegas in May. By that point, i was fed up. \n\nHis father is a part of the fraternity as well. So i contact Carl's dad about the situation and my concerns that i will not be repaid the $2k i am owed because his son does not make an effort to repay me, and I've tried to be nothing but respectful until this point. \n\nCurrently there is tension in the household and Carl rarely comes to hang out with us if I'm involved. And if i appear in the living room, he will either do a chore or go to his room. I didnt want this to happen, but i can only imagineowing your roommate $2k. \n\n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1686753323, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1499hlk/aita_for_involving_my_frat_bros_dad_into_rhe_debt/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In my Fraternity you got one strike when it came to debts, strike two was a \"Come to Jesus\" talk, strike three was character assassination until compliance was achieved. \n\nMy brother said in the Army strike three was they'd beat the fuck out of said person and call it a training accident.", "NTA. You're way too nice. This guy STOLE from you and your housemates. He took your money and then didn't use it to pay rent.  He should be kissing your feet for not pressing charges.", "INFO: why are you the only one covering Carl's rent? Why aren't the other frat brothers helping? Sounds like you all need to discuss Carl's future as a roommate since he can't keep up with his share.", "NTA. Carl is irresponsible.", "NTA but he\u2019s not gonna pay you back. I would look into how to either go into small claims court or get a lawyer to write a letter saying you expect payment", "NTA - \"You shoulda kept this between us\" is a favorite defense by people who don't take care of their own business. If he isn't taking care of business, it's no longer his to keep private since it's affecting you and possibly your other roommates if you can't keep up with covering Carl's share of the rent.\n\nCarl is having trouble adulting, so talking to his dad is actually a mature and caring next step. What else are you gonna do, beat it out of him? No, you went to a trusted adult and said, \"Hey, Carl's having trouble and probably needs your help. I do too otherwise Carl's gonna run me broke!\"\n\nThe hope here is that his dad doesn't just pay for Carl's problems but also notices Carl is struggling to stay financially independent and gives him some help getting himself stable. He may need to straighten up some priorities in his life to make sure he's working enough hours to pay rent, and that means making choices that are hard for an ambitious young man.", "NTA, Carl isn\u2019t taking you seriously", "Info why is a 27 year old grown man living in a frat house?", "In my fraternity experience, as an active and an alumni advisor, money is the number one reason why chapters fail.

However NTA for contacting dad if it was in the spiriy of \u201cyour son is getting himself into serious trouble and needs help\u201d. \n\nBut what you\u2019re describing is fairly worrying to me.  \nAs far as I can tell Carl owes appx 3k just in your house and his plan is to get a (payday) loan while not even beinh able to make ends meet as is. \nThe kind of loans he qualifies for are extremely predatorial and can ruin his credit and his life for good. \n\nThe fact that he neglects BASIC needs like rent over eating out or going to Vegas suggests yo me that he has lost control of his financial situation and is doing the ostrich. If he can\u2019t see, it\u2019s not there, right? And lease is up soon and he will leave and the debt to you guys will noy be his problem anymore. \n\nMy guess is he have aldready started taking quick loans and because he feels/knows he\u2019s in a hopeless situation, his mental strategy is something along the lines of \u201cfuck it if I owe 5000 or 8000, might as well have some fun anyway\u201d. It pretty common in people who are work up debt, kind of like, if you\u2019re going to hell, might as well arrive in style. \n\nYou can try to help him see this but don\u2019t expect that money back. It\u2019s gone.", "NTA. Carl's lucky he hasn't been kicked out or sued.", "NTA.  I hope you are sending him text messages for proof when you take him to court to get him to pay.", "Nta... And stories like this is why I do not want to have a roommate ever", "NTA. You have been more reasonable than most people would be about letting him pay back his debt. He has done nothing to try to settle it. Text him and give him a time frame for when he has to pay you back, and if he doesn't, tell him you'll take him to small claims court. If he owes other people money too, then it's a pattern of behavior. He's not your responsibility. Also in the future, you should pay your rent separately to your landlord so it can't get skimmed. Then if a portion is missing, the landlord will hopefully take it out on that person, not all of you - depending on what your lease is like.\n\nUnfortunately you're just going to have to deal with the tension with Carl until your lease comes up and you can get away from him. He's the one who's making things awkward, not you.", "NTA. Choices have consequences and he\u2019s screwing you over, not the other way around.", "NTA- He is behaving like an entitled child, I\u2019d have called his daddy to deal with it too.\nSomeone must be governing Carl because it\u2019s not Carl! You did the right thing, but he should be told to leave ASAP.\nStealing from roommates and then the audacity to act as a victim\u2026. Ok there Carl.", "NTA.  If he behaves with the maturity of a child in focusing on his debts, then it\u2019s only right his father is informed.", "Yta. He\u2019s a grown man. Kick him out if he\u2019s not paying for his stuff. Quit letting him scam you out of money", "YTA - for contacting his father, his father has nothing to do with this situation, you were out of line contacting his father.", "YTA.  The guy is 27 and you felt the need to call his daddy on him?\n\nNext time you find yourself in this situation, try, instead, telling the Carl in question that you need to be paid back, and if he continues to not pay back, you'll be opening a case in small claims court.  You really don't want to have to do that, but you need to protect yourself, so can we please just resolve this like friends?", "That\u2019s a lot of money at any age.", "In the army, he wouldn't get 3 chances.", "So in terms of the roommates, everyone else is part time and a full time student. So they live paycheck to paycheck but theyre able to balance it out and budget. Im the only full time worker with a decent pay (i can make a savings account and be fine if i get fired or laid off). So they cannot really contribute but I'm just happy they can sustain themselves and can budget. \n\nIn terms of others in the frat, he owes about 3 other brothers money. Not as much as me but he still owes them each like over $300. I was not made aware of this until after the fact. \n\nWe have discussed our concerns with Carl. Because our lease is up by the end of July, we've told him how we're concerned that \n1) these debts wouldnt be paid and it's truly unjust. \n2) that this is a habit he cannot break. At least here in this town, we care about him and will give it to him straight. \n\nHe plans to move to NYC after graduation in December and i have told him that I'm concerned if this keeps going, he'll face worse consequences", "This is the best response here, others are way too black n white with little to no explanation \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "Could i ask, what should i do?", "i maybe agree with you. but why is it such an in appropriate thing to do? carl is still clearly not financially independent, so aren't his parents relevant?", "Unless his father has any amount of influence over him.", "[deleted]", "NTA, he sounds like he's intentionally being a leech", "I'm a debt collector. When debtors are dodging me, I am legally allowed to call their family to request contact information for the person. You are NTA for contacting his dad. I'm certain this guy would prefer that to being served small claims court paperwork.", "Ignore this guy, he's expecting you to swallow a 2k loss to spare a scamming flatmate's pride", "Unless his parents are on the lease, the is a situation between OP and Carl, no one else.", "I would imagine so only because Carl prides himself in his lineage. He speaks highly of his father", "No, I pay my own bills. My parents/family have nothing to do with my finances."]}
