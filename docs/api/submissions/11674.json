But people have to do those things and you don't get to be free of all noise any time living in around people. If you are being considerate and not doing this for two hours every weekend, and you are doing it during daylight hours, then you are doing nothing wrong. \n\nIt is totally fine for someone to ask you to stop in certain circumstances- my neighbors once asked us to turn down the music of a BBQ because they were hosting a post-funeral get together, and you better believe we turned it off because they were polite and we understood why they would ask for quiet at an abnormal time.
