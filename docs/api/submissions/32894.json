But her husband left her and she\u2019s a single mother now. she\u2019s struggling financially to raise her kids. \n\nI feel bad for her because despite her cheating on me she was my first love. so i\noffered to help her out. i send her money every month and would sometimes look after her kids. \n\nAisha found out about this last week and blew up on me. she said what i\u2019m doing to her is also considered cheating and wants me to stop because she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable. she asked me if Jane tried flirting with me and i said yes but I set boundaries and told her that i\u2019m not interested in a relationship with her.\n\nThis pissed Aisha off so she dumped me.\nI was planning to propose next month and my whole world is gone in a second. i tried reaching out but Aisha is not responding.\n\nMy friends who like Aisha are disappointed in me. They called me the AH for helping out Jane because i don\u2019t owe her anything and she\u2019s taking advantage of me.

You were married to someone for 8 months, she cheats on you- then you pay her for four more years?  \n\nWhat the fuck. Why?  You owe this woman nothing. You\u2019re sacrificing your relationship\u2026.to fund your ex wife? \n\nBecause everything about this is so wildly dumb, YTA\n\nShe cheats on you and is rewarded for her behaviour by getting monthly payments. Insane.", "YTA primarily because you were DEEP in this relationship with Aisha before she found out about this. You were going to propose next month, but she only learned of this last week. That tells me you didn't do a good job being clear with her on the nature of your relationship with your ex. This is indeed an unusual arrangement and I don't blame her for being caught off guard and for being unhappy at being left in the dark, and for questioning if there is more to your relationship with Jane. This even kinda reads like you might still have a spark for Jane to be honest.", "YTA.\n\nYou are still emotionally pining for your ex-wife.  Aisha is correct, you were cheating on her.\n\nThere is no reason to be financially supporting your ex-wife and taking care of her kids except that you want her back.  She made her own situation of being a single mother and it is her responsibility to figure it out.\n\nAisha made the right move.", "YTA. What did you expect Aisha to do. No reasonable person would put up with that. Jane is also a grifter. Her choices set her life up the way it is. It\u2019s not your fault. Grow a pair and call Aisha and say this, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you were right, I cut Jane out of my life, you are the only person I care for, I apologize for being so dense\u201d", "yes YTA, and a doormat.", "YTA. Sorry but your Ex Wife cheated on you, ended the marriage, met someone else, married him, popped out a few kids, he's now gone too and you try riding in like white knight to her rescue?  WTF Dude...have some self worth.", "YTA and spineless lol. Wow.\n\n100% deserved to be dumped for being a doormat", "YTA\n\nWhat is wrong with you??\n\nShe betrayed you - and now you support her abd the kids she had with other men??\n\nI dont blame your GF at all...\n\nAnd yes, the ex is taking advantage of you...\n\nAnd yes, by keeping something like this secret from your GF, by having this inappropriate relation to your ex could be considered cheating.", "YTA - you made choices and those choices came back to bite you. You are desperate to be loved by your first wife that you sacrificed your future. She was right to leave but hopefully you cut off the ex wife so future relationships can thrive.", "Wow.... a lot to unpack.  \n\nI don't think it is \"bad\" that you are helping out your ex.  Its quite charitable actually.  And its your money, do what you want etc. \n\nWhere you may be heading into asshole territory is this:  \n\nINFO:  so what was the plan to have been when you and aisha got officially married?  Would you still be supporting the ex?  \n\nWas the plan to keep your and Aisha's finances completely separate ? (i.e. Aisha was probably not wanting to be contributing toward your ex)\n\nFor that matter, what is the plan in general?  How long would you be supporting your ex? a year? 2 years? until the kids are in college?  What does the ex NOT financially struggling look like?  I mean, say you are giving her 1k a month.  After some amount of time, that 1k will become a foundational part of her income.  If you decide to stop, and then what happens when she can't pay rent?  You start back again?  \n\nits fair for Aisha to be upset about this I think.  She's joining her future with yours and you are giving away money.  What happens if/when you hit hard times, want to save for something?  \n\nI mean... you are doing your ex a real solid, but at some point you are going to have to make some kind of choice.  Because I can't imagine any other future GF/Fiance/Wife will ever like this situation.    And you are putting yourself in a position you can't really extract yourself from as she will turn on the tears and/or charm and you may relent.   So basically you have put yourself in a really untenable situation that is either going to prevent any future relationships from happening and/or permanently tying yourself to your ex.  \n\nFor that, I'm giving you a YTA.", "YTA for having an emotional affair with Jane, AND supporting her and her kids financially while dating Aisha. \n\nYou lied, cheated and tried to justify your actions with one bizarre excuse after another.", " YTA. Cut her off.", "YTA. If you\u2019re going to make a decision like that and you\u2019re planning on progressing your relationship, you needed to talk to them first. You come across as shady and still in love with your ex. Your behaviour would turn any rationale person off. You had no reason to continue contact with your ex. You\u2019re sending mixed signals to both women.", "YTA. Sounds like you were emotionally cheating to me, my dude. If you're keeping something from your SO, it's safe to assume you're already aware it's inappropriate.", "YTA\u2026 my first love was Jennifer Anniston, then she goes off and marries Brad Pitt. She never gave me a dime!", "Yta. Good for Aisha. She did the right thing", "You're being an asshole to your girlfriend and yourself.", "YTA. You had to ask? Why don\u2019t you just marry Jane again? You seem forever attached to her. And a ready-made family to boot!", "[removed]", "Sort of speechless on this one. How do you not see you're wrong. Is this even a YTA situation.", "YTA you're literally not over your ex and you're using her kids excuse to spend time with her.  Leave this girl stop wasting her life on a fake relationship.\n\nEdit I didn't see that she already dumped you you got what you deserve.", "YTA because if this story isn\u2019t fake, you can\u2019t be that dense. It\u2019s like a comedic ally bad decision. All around.", "Hahahaha YTA.\n\nYou did this to yourself, I honestly think the best way for this story to wrap up is to get back with your ex and allow her to sleep with others while you dutifully wait at home.", "YAH sorry but it\u2019s true. You were paying your ex wife while dating someone else. And it doesn\u2019t sound like these were alimony payments required by law. So it seems like you were hoping to get back together while you\u2019re dating someone else. I can\u2019t imagine you don\u2019t see that. No matter what you say you were trying to do, your girlfriend rightly sees it that way. \n\nHonestly your best bet is to get remarried to this girl, have her sign an ironclad prenup, and hope for the best. You aren\u2019t over her and you\u2019re not going to get over her. So either lean into your obsession or stop being involved in her life at all.", "YTA", "Yta.  You so have feelings for your ex.   You have to choose.", "YTA\n\nYour ex cheated on you and you have no children with her. She doesn't deserve your help. It sucks for her kids but she put herself in that position. By sending her support and saying she was your first love you're basically emotionally cheating on your new girl.", "YTA, you're giving money to your ex who cheated on you for kids that aren't yours for sympathy from you she doesn't deserve. \n\nAisha is absolutely right, it's one thing if it was a convo before you sent the money, but if I found out my partner was sending money to my ex I'd be very upset as well. \n\nYou tried to be nice, got played like a sucker, now it might cost you Aisha too.", "YTA. \n\nYou have no ties to your ex except for emotional... you are emotionally cheating. You have kept in regular contact with an ex when you have no reason to do so and are financially supporting her. \n\nNo woman is going to stay with you when you come with a built-in secret mistress.", "YTA and I would absolutely leave you over this.", "This gotta be fake\ud83d\udc80", "YTA I would dump you to for supporting your ex wife when you have no obligation to her and are in a new relationship. Babysitting? Maybe ok but financially support? Hell no", "Absolute YTA.", "YTA. You wanted t propose but were secretly funding your EX. If you had ever thought it was fine...you would have told your GF sooner.  \nYou knew your EX flirted with you and wanted you back, that's enough to cut the relationship off, before you propose to your GF.", "Think if the whole situation was reversed and Aisha was sending her ex money minding his kids to help out and he has been flirting with her even if she put boundaries down. And never told you she was doing this when all along you thought you where potentially creating this life with this woman all the while she is still supporting her ex whom she has no responsibilities with (children, alimony etc) and is in routine contact with by the sounds of it. Now sit and think how you would feel if you where in Aishas shoe's..", "You never got over her", "YTA for disrespecting your partner, shit like this is stuff you need to talk about to ensure you're on the same page. Also if she needs money she can sue her husband for it.", "Yta. IF you're not cheating it definitely LOOKS like you are, and have been for a while. I'm not even sure you can convince your current ex otherwise, I mean I definitely wouldn't believe you... It sounds wrong on every level...", "YTA\n\nDude. She needs to take care of her business. \n\nDo you really think your current gf or any future partner is going to accept this? Stop being a doormat with no self respect. \n\nEnough with the white knight shit. You divorced a cheater after 8 months of marriage. She can get Her kids father to pay child support.", "YTA, but jeez what a weird timeline. Divorced 4 years ago and already 3 kids.", "YTA.  Aisha is right.  Your friends are right.  A friend might babysit.  A friend might loan someone some money.  But sending money every month is too much, especially if you kept it a secret from your girlfriend.\n\nSo, you either admit to yourself that you never got over Jane, and go ahead and get back together and raise that other guys kids as your own, and wait for Jane to cheat on you again...\n\nOr you go no-contact with Jane, stop giving her money obviously, and then wait patiently for Aisha to forgive you, or for the next person to come into your life.", "YTA - but can you marry me for a few weeks?  I could use the money", "I guess your only option is to hate yourself and go back to Jane.", "Wtf how could anyone be so dumb \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0fof course YTA!", "YTA but you're mostly just stupid.", "YTA, you owe Jane nothing. On top of that she cheated on you. And now you are cheating emotionally on Aisha.\n\nMaybe you dont want Aisha but want cheating Jane with 3 kids?", "Oh my goodness, YTA bigly!!", "YTA.\n\nYou still have feelings for your ex and you hid those from your fiancee. \n\nStay single until she means nothing to you and don't be a doormat.", "I don't know if you have bad self esteem or you just don't care about your relationship with Aisha, but you owe Jane nothing.  I mean if you were worth a boatload of money and you threw her a few bucks it's one thing, but giving her what sounds like a fair amount of cash every month is basically cheating on Aisha.  She's better off w/o you.  YTA.", "YTA why are you paying her???? You\u2019re not her kids father or her husband! What did you expect your gf to feel?", "YTA\n\nYou threw away a good girl for a cheating ex. These aren't your kids and the woman has tried to get back with you and you think its okay.", "You are not the AH for helping your ex, even though she does not deserve it, her children are  very lucky to have someone with recourses in their life to help. \n\nYTA because you kept that significant information from Aisha, and did not discuss it with her so she can have a say in the financials and discuss boundaries. That's what healthy partnerships do. You can't just go rogue and not include her. It only made her feel like you kept that information from her because you had something to hide (i.e. cheating). If you can hide this, what other stuff are you hiding? \n\nAlso whether you realize or not, you admitted in this post that you still love your ex, and she has crossed boundaries by flirting with you. You can't be mad at Aisha for seeing the signs and bailing before you waste more of her time when you are still clearly stuck on your ex. Don't get back with ex. She is manipulating you, and she might cheat on you again or you will just mistrust her and have a toxic relationship. Did the husband leave because she continues to cheat? She makes her bed every night and lays in it. You don't need to help her.", "Your a dummy", "YTA", "YTA to yourself!", "Do you care more about your ex-wife that cheated on you or your current girlfriend?", "YTA.  Mainly you are being an AH to yourself.  It is time to let go of Jane and yes, she is using you.  Everyone has a first love and everyone moves on without them.  You need to do the same.", "Well at least you can go back to your ex wife now ..\nYta", "I'm going to say you're an asshole because you're being an asshole to yourself.\n\nNice to help people out once in awhile but she cheated on you and you got divorced The financial support needs to stop.\n\nBut then again this is your life and it sure seems like it's making him miserable", "Yta.", "you are an idiot and the new girlfriend should leave you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhell maybe youll pay her too", "You\u2019re an idiot to be doing that in the first place so clearly a YTA judgement will make no difference to you", "YTA - Aisha did the right thing. What you did is as bad as cheating.", "Your ex-wife cheated on you, has been divorced for 4 years, is married again, has no kids with you, still hits on you, and you were only married 8 measly months. And you didn't mention any of this to your GF for a solid year of dating. Any sane woman will run for the hills, OP. Your situation is absurd. YTA", "YTA wtf. Imagine you were in Aisha\u2019s shoes. \u201cMy partner sends money to their cheating ex wife, without any legal obligation\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re not in love with Aisha if you\u2019re this stuck in the past. The moment you shifted priorities to providing for your ex is the moment you basically cheated. No sane person would ever put up with this and thank god Aisha left. How did you manifest the balls to sacrifice your relationship for someone who will never value you the same? The fact that this is the hill you\u2019re dying on is so incredibly confounding and sad", "YTA, I do not consider this cheating. But you need to forget your ex, you owe her nothing. If I was you ingore and block your ex, and stop giving her money. See a therapist and get your life back.", "In my opinion that is emotionally cheating\u2026 you have some weird attachment to your ex so I can see why Aisha left I would also", "How tf did you manage to start your own profitable business with this level of idiocy and lack of common sense\u2026.\n\nYou\u2019re PAYING your ex who cheated on you and had 3 kids with another man. And you don\u2019t understand why your gf doesn\u2019t like this? The fact that you\u2019re PAYING your ex wife when you don\u2019t have to?\n\nAlso, not for nothing, she likely thinks you\u2019re weak and spineless for paying her and offering to babysit her kids when she cheated on you and ruined your marriage. Turns out women aren\u2019t attracted to sad, weak men. Who knew.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nNot because you are helping your ex-wife, but because you are hiding this fact from someone you plan to spend your life with, knowing she would not be okay with it.  \nYou deliberately hid important information from Aisha before she made a significant life decision, aware that this information could change her mind. You are deceptive, manipulative and disrespectful. You broke Aisha's trust, and she left you, yet you are still here seeking validation for your behaviour.", "YTA", "Besides an arsehole you're also an idiot.", "Aisha was right to leave you. Your ex isn\u2019t your problem anymore and your behaviour is troubling.", "You\u2019re clearly not over your ex and maintaining a relationship with her is going to keep you from having a successful relationship with anyone else. You\u2019re not only sending money but watching her kids? Thats just crazy talk", "YTA. I mean, I guess it\u2019s nice to want to help someone out, but I wouldn\u2019t send money to an ex without a court order, especially one who cheated. I can see why your now former GF would be mad. Seems like you aren\u2019t over the ex", "YTA\n\nAlso if you are in the US as you have been financially supporting her you may find your ex can now sue you for child support. \n\nWow what an idiot.", "YTA. You and your ex do not have any kids together. She is not your responsibility. I wouldn\u2019t be with someone who can\u2019t cut loose exe\u2019s, so no wonder Aisha dumper you.", "Yes you are an idiot. I understand your good intentions, but acting on them in such a stupid way leads to painful consequences. I would not trust you after that. I don\u2019t care about your good intentions your actions speak on their own. Your ex was your past, you hid what you did from the woman you love now, that makes you a liar, even worse the resources that you can use to make a wonderful life with the new person you give them away to your past. Learn to move on, let your ex deal with the pain of her own mistakes. \n\nThere is no limit to human stupidity, think twice next time, learn from this and don\u2019t be so f stupid.\n\nYes you are the AH, because you lied, never lie. Or at least don\u2019t lie to yourself. And on top of that your actions were extremely stupid, on the border of insanity. No one gives a fuck about your good intentions if your actions are so stupid.", "My God are you a sucker, and a dumb one at that.", "YTA. Not for helping your ex, but for only just now telling your fiancee about it. You're going to have a hard time finding someone willing to put up with your relationship with your ex.", "Technically, you are not an asshole...\n\n...but you are a dumbass\n\nGood luck", "i can say if you're the asshole, in my eye you're a good intentioned moron, is good you have this kind of empathy but man respect yourself and your relationships a little bit more, helping her out was noble of you but also really stupid\n\ngood on you to be a good person, bad on you to be a doormat, even with boundaries this is bad, also in one of your comments you said that you just started helping her like a year ago, did you talk to your posible fiancee about it? did you keep it in the dark about it? didn't this should be a conversation to have with her the moment you started helping? for this mate you're are a moron (sorry if I seem harsh)", "YTA.  And you are being abused by Jane.  Stop sending her money or communicating with her at all, regardless of what your future with Aisha is.", "YTA and clearly a bit of an idiot. She is very clearly taking advantage of you, it's so clear you could see it from space with just your eyes and what's just as clear is that you're still not over her", "YTA might as well get back with your exwife, raise her kids, then she will be out with the next dude.  You need some selfesteem.", "This is the most pathetic shit I have EVER read. You are still hung up on your cheating ex that you are giving her money while you had a gf??? Who the FUCK DOES THAT??? You are never going to get another girlfriend till you get your balls from under your ex. You sure you\u2019re a man??\n\nYTA", "YTA - listen generally speaking it is your decision what you do with your money. Now personally I would advice you against sending it to your cheating ex-wife and tell you to use it as material for starting a fire instead but this is just me.\nHowever what is not debatable is that it gives off a horrible look to Aisha.\nIt\u2019s not just that you didn\u2019t tell her which makes it even more suspicious but if I were a girl, I most likely would believe you sre still madly in love with your ex and consider your girlfriend a placeholder.\nThe vibes this behaviour is sending, no matter how good your intention may be is terrible and I can\u2019t stress enough how much I advice you to move on from having any contact be it personally or financially with your ex.", "YTA, might as well get back with your ex, she continues to ruin your life and you reward her lol", "Mental that this guy is getting grief for *checks notes* NOT being an absolute prick to an ex", "Most people are out for themselves, so I want to say I commend you for your selflessness, though I'm assuming you are doing it because you care about her as a friend and person, not that it's romantic or from guilt.   \nI think believing in equality should also mean helping those less fortunate than us if we have the means, and it seems you are, you are helping three young innocent kids! I can see where your girlfriend is coming from but there are not enough details for me to judge either way.", "YTA bud, she cheated on you and you have somebody new. It's time to move on. She's not your problem, neither are those kids, this is one of life's hard lessons. Pick your mate wisely.", "YTA! You and your ex deserve each other.", "Not sure Id call it exactly cheating but thats just semantics.  It sucks.    Id dump u over that too.", "You already know your answer.", "Why are u supporting a woman who cheated on u then brought 3 kids into this world in 4 years that wasn't at all finically ready for children? Ur a dumb ass dude Aisha deserves much better then u. Go take care of janes 3 kids and fund her life u doormat. As a 29 year old man I cannot understand ur spineless logic at all.", "So you were only married to Jane for 8 months at the age of 24 and have no kids together, and she received her share of the shared assets in the divorce proceedings and no alimony right? And the reason was because she betrayed you by cheaing?\n\nThen, within four years, she managed to get married, had three kids, and divorced a second time by 28? And presumably she got what she was owed from the shared assets in that divorce and now receives child support?\n\nAnd you just finance this ex?\n\nYeah, I'd break up with you too. Either you're still in love with her, or you're gullible as fuck. I wouldn't want to share a life or a bank account with someone who is either of those things. YTA.", "YTA. She's using you and doesn't care about you. Why on earth would you consistently pay someone who cheated on you? Grow a backbone.", "YTA, and Jesus dude how low is your self worth that you would fund someone who cheated on you, had children with other men, and is using you? And you are sacrificing your own personal relationships as well for absolutely nothing.\n\nJane is probably laughing with her friends about how she is getting her cake, eating it too, and to top it off, ruining her ex\u2019s life without having to lift a finger. You seriously need help.", "Yeah man YTA this is stupid af and you need to move on. No woman will want to be with you when you\u2019re hung up on your ex, and if you think you aren\u2019t you\u2019ve got a long way to go before getting into another relationship.", "I've never seen someone use so many words to say \"I'm an idiot and a loser\" before. YTA bro.", "Not your aren't quite TA I think what this is called is a cuckold. Am I using that right? Feels right.", "YTA - sounds like your ex is using you. Also are you sure the father isn\u2019t paying child support? Sounds to me like she has two men paying her bills.\n\nAlso what would happen once you both got married? Was you expecting her to subsidise your living costs so you can still give money to your ex? \n\nCommon now", "Good grief, what the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nThat's not generosity, that's being someone's doormat. I don't blame Aisha one bit for dumping you. I would have assumed you were still in love with your ex, but even if not, that's just too messed up to try to unpack.\n\nYTA.", "This isn't even about the money.  It's about going behind your GF's back to try to insert yourself into an Instant Happy Family with your ex and her kids.  Of course she dumped you.  You didn't make her a priority, instead, you gave your time, money, and attention to someone cheated on you and \"kind of flirted\" with you.   That money could have been saved for a kick ass honey moon.  Or a down payment on a house.  Or to start a kid's college fund.  *ANYTHING to do with your GF and your future with her.*  Instead, you threw it away on the past. \n\nYTA", "YTA-You don\u2019t owe a cheater anything.", "Aisha, deserved better. \n\nWhy would you fund your ex wife?

Wtf. I would run too.", "YTA its good your exgirfriend has no time for your nonsence.She droped you like a hot potato.You my dude are not a partner material.", "Lol smart professionally but dumb as fuck in your personal life for sure. Giving money to someone who violated your relationship. Ridiculous.", "It's a good thing she left before getting married and sinking into his mess", "YTA so you met with your ex behind your girlfriend\u2019s back without mentioning this at all. Your ex even tried to hit on you and again you didn't let your gf know. \n\nBut not enough, you're also babysitting her kids and finance your ex\u2019s life! Again, all without saying a single word to your partner. What did you tell her where you were when you watched your ex\u2019s kids? When you met up with the ex? Did you lie?\n\nYes, that would be emotionally cheating for me as well. And I believe that you're at least still in love with your ex. But the dealbreaker would be the lying. I'd not marry a guy who meets exes behind my back and doesn't even think it's necessary to mention that you're still very much entangled with your ex. \n\nShe dodged a bullet. And you should check why you kept this a secret from your gf? Maybe because you knew it was not ok? If you ever want to have a chance at a new relationship you need to work through what's going on with you and your ex.", "ESH.\n\nGeez, your ex wife popped out three kids in the four years after divorcing you, and then got divorced again?  My thoughts are she made her choices, and now she has to live with them.  I do think she is taking advantage of you and you are enabling her.  She can continue on as business as usual.\n\nI can understand your ex girl friend's position too.  She wants to be the one and only, and maybe she thinks what I wrote above.\n\nAnd I can understand your position too, but you need to get over your ex wife and move on.

But her husband left her and she\u2019s a single mother now. she\u2019s struggling financially to raise her kids. \n\nI feel bad for her because despite her cheating on me she was my first love. so i\noffered to help her out. i send her money every month and would sometimes look after her kids. \n\nAisha found out about this last week and blew up on me. she said what i\u2019m doing to her is also considered cheating and wants me to stop because she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable. she asked me if Jane tried flirting with me and i said yes but I set boundaries and told her that i\u2019m not interested in a relationship with her.\n\nThis pissed Aisha off so she dumped me.\nI was planning to propose next month and my whole world is gone in a second. i tried reaching out but Aisha is not responding.\n\nMy friends who like Aisha are disappointed in me. They called me the AH for helping out Jane because i don\u2019t owe her anything and she\u2019s taking advantage of me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your motives are clearly pure. \n\nWhat makes YTA is you not consulting Aisha with it at least in the beginning to let her know what you want to do and discussing it with her for her to be onboard. She may have understood and maybe even asked for you to help her one off or even help with setting the boundaries. She is understandably upset. \n\ngive her time.\n\nAlso don\u2019t care if I get downvoted. OP asked if he did a bad thing for helping and truth is he didn\u2019t.

This connection is not healthy for you or for her, even though you seem to be acting out of a charitable impulse. You may wish to discuss this with your counselor.

She knows you\u2019re an easy mark and thought nothing of taking advantage of your feelings for her and jeopardizing your happiness. I would cut her off and offer to move as far away as possible with Aisha, though I don\u2019t blame her for not taking you back. If you stay in contact with your ex you are a fool. Let her ex support her and his kids. I call bs on her sob story.", "Yta you deserved to he dumped now go play daddy to Jane's kids because that's clearly what you want you were giving g heroneey and watching her kids you had no boundaries and the woman you claimed to want to marry was in the dark and I bet you still would have given Jane money after the wedding taking resources from your wife and future kids", "OP, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH.

But as long as you keep subsidizing her, she\u2019ll never do that.", "YTA, she cheated on you .. should have ended all communication the minute you divorced for numerous reasons. I don't blame Aisha for thinking you are cheating on her. How I would interrupt this as is you not being over your ex because who else in the right mind supports a ex, who cheated and is fully aware that they are trying to hit on them? boundaries or not.  \n\nYou should really consider going to therapy to work on your self worth so that you can fully heal and cut contact to Jane. Otherwise you will struggle to have normal relationships. Because yes she is taking advantage of your kindness or rather naivety. \n\nAgain I don't blame Aisha's reaction, only advice I have is to give her time and maybe write an apology to be given to her by friends and it will be her choice to reach out.

She does get to decide that it\u2019s a sign you\u2019re too emotionally invested in your ex and break up with you. Think about whether she\u2019s right. \n\nYour ex is being punished plenty being a broke single mother with three kids. She\u2019s not your problem or your responsiblity, and you should consider whether you\u2019d like to keep giving her money. Is it just until she gets her footing? What you\u2019re doing is incredibly kind but perhaps not in your best interests.", "YTA \n\nThis dynamic is going to be unacceptable to almost any woman you date, especially since you know Jane is still pursuing you.

Regardless of how you feel about Aisha, you're loving the fact that your ex-wife is flirting and you think that you're calling the shots, emotionally and financially.  Look, if you want your ex-wife back, go for it, but don't be surprised when she's a cheater all over again.  That's what cheaters do.
