Well, my friend was pretty pissed about what happened and texted saying that I was an asshole for starting a discussion which I knew very well his gf would be left out of and that we never discuss our school materials at parties, so I must've done this purposefully.

Throw in the fact that you are clearly in love with your best friend and tried to belittle his girlfriend by not so subtly centring the conversation around you being smart enough to be in med school to make her feel less than you and it sounds like something straight from Greys anatomy. \n\nAlso... do you know how pathetic it is to look down on professions just because they are different to your own.

Very much so", "Let me guess... you're single.

That was a shit move. \n\nEventually you ALL are going to need a network of friends and family who aren't part of your medical field or you'll burn out and lose your minds. Is your intent to haze everyone who shows up from the outside? Or did you give her special treatment out of some particular feeling of jealousy? YTA either way.", "YTA. You say \"she has no other plans in life\" as if taking over her parent's bakery is nothing.

Has everything to do with medicine not being her line of work/study\n\nAccording to your logic, med students can only date and hang out with other med students. Damn that sounds so boring. \n\nStop making your friends girlfriend feel left out. Try getting to know her. You might learn something.

Of course YTA.  Your condescending tone gave it away.", "YTA- you made a conscious choice to bring up a subject that she would not be able to follow along.  She had no problem before that, she had no problem with anyone else.  You do come across as a very stuck up person who thinks they are better then others.

So shows you dont know much about certain subjects, I am sure if she spoke about what she does you'd not follow a long either.  Arrogance does not look good on anyone.", "There's a lot more to being successful than academic prowess. How awful will your bedside manner be when you are so condescending and dismissive of others?\n\nYou think you're better than her but you're showing your friend the very opposite is true.\n\nIf you valued your friend's happiness, you would understand that we don't all seek out clones of ourselves as partners, and that period who are quite different can make each other very happy.\n\nIf you valued his friendship you would make a real effort for the woman he is dating.\n\nYour friend is right that if you had been trying, you could easily have avoided excluding his GF at the party even if everyone else there were med students.\n\nYou are making excuses, and from what you've written I think you know it but are clinging to a delusion that she's not good enough for him.", "YTA, and arrogant, snobby, cliquish, and insincere. You change the subject to make yourself feel better about yourself and make her feel less. There is nothing wrong with taking over a bakery.

The best thing is you showed him your true colors, so he sees who you are now...petty.", "YTA. By your own admission, nobody discusses school stuff at these parties and she was being included in conversations before then. And even if we believe you, that you didn't do it on purpose, when you realised she was being left out, you should have changed the topic. \n\nAlso, I don't see how she can be a 'stereotypical bimbo' if she works in a bakery and is business minded enough to plan to take it over. Working in a bakery is actually quite tough - she is unlikely to be doing the job in heels, long nails and a full face of make up (although more power to her if she is) but it suggests that your issue with her is that she's attractive, nothing else, and you're trying to dismiss her as being dumb even though you've got no evidence to back it up. \n\nNot everyone is a med student. That doesn't make them dumb or lesser than you. And if you're this jealous of your alleged best friend's girlfriend, you either are massively insecure about yourself or in love with your best friend.", "YTA Why can't medical school students learn to talk about ANYTHING else when they are around other people?

He knows about it too, but he's funding your petty power trip really unattractive. I mean, he chose his baker girlfriend over you, and he is actively chosing her over you all over.

Everyone else was acting appropriately until you decided to make a damn clique like you were in fucking high school. You should try growing up at some point OP.", "I feel like your book smart but a complete dumb ass when it comes to human interaction. I'm so very excited you're going to be becoming a doctor! That's the attitude we need for a doctor, judging peoples personalities by there looks. So intelligent! We have so much to learn from your lack of empathy.", "Firstly, it is not your choice and unless he asked for your opinion on the matter it is not for you to suggest. Secondly, don't confused education with intellect. I have met many a highly educated people that I can hardly have a conversation with and cannot perform basic life tasks at a manageable level and I have met people who never completed high school but run very successful businesses and are extremely well read and thought out. Even if, as you say, she isn't on the same level as him intellectually, have you considered that perhaps that may be why or one of the reasons he likes her. Most people don't want to marry themselves and want something a little different. Perhaps he gets tired of endlessly talking about medicine and what may one day be your guys career. Also the last thing I want to do after a long day of work is come home and talk more about work. I think you need to be honest about your actual feelings for this guy. It will help you put this in better perspective. I would guess that if he started dating one of your classmates you would find a reason not to like them as well.", "If that's true (and I don't think it is), it reflects quite badly on your friend - he wants someone less intelligent than him and doesn't mind the conversations being one sided. Your implication is that he only wants her because she's attractive. Well, if thats true, why are you judging her and not your friend? If I thought one of my friends was that shallow, I don't think I'd be referring them to as my best friend for very much longer. So either your friend is really quite a crappy person (in which case, why do you care about his life choices?) or he's actually a decent guy and he's chosen someone he that he respects and enjoys being around (in which case, your opinions of her she unfounded). Which is it?", "Not everything is about med-school and careers. You don't even know her. she could have a wealth of knowledge elsewhere. Just because she didn't choose to go into a med or doctorate programme doesn't mean she is less than in conversation or as a person. Get off your high horse and worry about yourself.", "Jesus, upu are sudying to be a doctor?\n\nYou place is nowhere near a patient. You will kill people.\n\nYTA.", "Okay smart ass, you do know that there are multiple types of intelligence and being academically inclined is just one of them? You're clearly lacking in interpersonal and emotional intelligence, so despite being a med student, you're just booksmart not \"intelligent.\" You're clearly jealous if think about how \"one- sided their conversations must be.\" And you have so much internalized misogyny which is just awful. YTA.", "Info: why do you THINK he needs a partner \"more intellectually close\"?\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\n\n\nMaybe they are close in other ways and their percieved intelligence doesn't matter? \ud83d\ude09\n\nYTA", "Dude, you go to a trade school. Stop acting superior. YTA", "You barely know this woman because you\u2019ve made a point of not getting to know her. So you don\u2019t even know how good their conversations are. They might have tons in common, but to you she\u2019s just some dummy because she isn\u2019t in med school. You\u2019re going to make a horrible doctor if you\u2019re this judgemental.", "As I said in another comment, you are not as smart as you think you are. \u201cMore intellectually closer to him\u201d is grammatically wrong. \n\nIt would either be \u201cintellectually closer\u201d or \u201cmore intellectual\u201d. \n\nSeriously if you are going to go around calling you \u201cbf\u2019s (gee wonder if there is anything Freudian about using that term) girlfriend a bimbo, maybe learn how to write a god damned sentence first.", "Yea, I get that. Too bad people like that are usually c\\*\\*\\*y b\\*\\*\\*\\*es like you so, catch 22, right?", "A person does not have to be academically intelligent to be an interesting person. My partner has 2 degrees while I dropped out of Uni in my first year. Our academic resumes had zero impact on our ability to connect with each other over the many other interests we have. I have also been successful in my work despite my lack of qualifications and currently earn more than him.\n\nConversely the reverse is also true. An academically intelligent person such as, say, a med student can truly be as dumb as rocks when it comes to common sense and acceptable social behaviour. YTA and this kind of snobbery is a really unattractive quality to have. You might want to work on that.", "Well apparently you can\u2019t talk about anything other than med school and misogynistic stereotypes, so you\u2019re not exactly a riveting conversationalist yourself.", "Maybe she sucks a dick better than you can....", "I don't know that you are in a position to judge her intelect.  Many very intelligent people go to work in trades.  Maybe she hates school, maybe she can't afford to go to university, maybe she just really likes to bake, maybe her family business is making her way more money.  You are making a lot of assumptions.  \n\nYou come accross as very arrogant and condecending.  YTA", "Your failure of imagination is not at all reflective of reality. You have evidence in front of your face that your friend likes spending time with this woman and she\u2019s successful in her field, so it\u2019s pretty telling that you are so invested in this idea that she must be dumb or somehow unattractive.", "Maybe he's just not as one dimensional as you are?", "I'm sure whatever they talk about is a lot more interesting and fulfilling to their relationship than your \"intellectual\" conversations about *med school exams*. Get off your high horse, because you don't have as much to offer as you seem to think you do.", "What do you mean you can't imagine? Isn't he your best friend? If he was having a problem not connecting with his girlfriend (intellectually or otherwise), wouldn't you know? Wouldn't he probably mention something like that to his best friend? \n\nYour view of relationships and how chemistry between two people works is so shallow. She could be really funny. She could be really kind. She could be super hot and they have great sex. They could both have similar hobbies outside of their chosen professions. Maybe he doesn't *only* talk about or think about his school and career (gasp!). It's like you're an alien who has never even heard of a relationship up until like a week ago or something. Do you think that every couple is made up of two people who are of the same IQ, working in the same field, and all they ever talk about is their work?", "Being \"intellectually superior\" is no replacement for basic human decency. I imagine she's a refreshing and real change after spending time with a pompous AH like you.  \n\nPlease rethink your career.  Between my husband and I we've come across more than our fair share of AH doctors. The world does not need anymore.", "Maybe she offers something different to the table that\u2019s just as interesting as intellect? Also just so you know, actual intellect is judged by your emotional intelligence. That\u2019s why characters like Sheldon from Big bang Theory are supposed to be funny because they\u2019re so smart but so dumb at the same time. I have a 4.0 gpa but I probably couldn\u2019t of added anything to the conversation you chose. You need to really reflect on this and what you\u2019re saying, because if you\u2019re going into the medical field you\u2019re going to have patients like this and you\u2019re going to have to learn to set your ego aside and be compassionate.", "People can have interests and personalities outside of their career you know.\n\nI was a carer for years and my husband was an engineer.", "Oh you are so going to get eaten alive when you start working in actual hospitals. \n\nYTA.", "So she's unintelligent because she wants to run a bakery? No wonder your friend doesn't want to date you.", "God you sound insufferable OP. YTA", "I know that", "It would be one thing if the GF was being a clown or actually acting \u201cignorant\u201d or something, but honestly she sounds pretty cool and that\u2019s coming from her worst detractor.", "Especially as she's got a first hand example of running a bakery, business and food sides.", "Because she's putting other women down to seem like the cool, smart, not like other girls girl in front of her bestfriend and onlookers.", "They don't teach that in medical school.\n\nSmehow though, most doctors still seem to think they know better...", "Learned something new, thank you! \ud83d\ude0a \ud83c\udfc6", "My mom was an NP gynecologist. Can\u2019t tell you how many times she was the 4th 5th or 6th clinician a desperate patient came to see after doctors dismissed or misdiagnosed them. \n\nMy mom took them seriously and LISTENED. And made patients feel safe enough to be honest. Yes, even \u201cblonde bimbo types\u201d. That\u2019s how she caught those little details that finally led to an accurate diagnosis and treatment. Even if she had personal judgments, she checked them at the door when she was in clinic. \n\nPeople were very sad and generous when she retired.", "this is based.", "she doesn't even need to, she's already attractive and not boring enough to talk about homework at parties.. OP, YTA", "Maybe she\u2019s a nice person with an actual personality.\n\nThat\u2019s her already several hundred points ahead of OP", "Which is why I was responding to the person who responded to you who identified OP as he?", "Yeah, she just sounds chill and friendly and was clearly fitting in fine until OP tried to make her feel left out.", "Ah, gotcha. I have a suspicion that maybe OP isn't as pretty as the gf and is salty af about it", "Oops, Reddit showed that as a reply to my original comment, not them. My bad. Carry on being epic and informative!"]}
