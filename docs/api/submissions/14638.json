It was pretty obvious my friend's girlfriend got lost instantly and she pretty much just took her bf aside and they ended up leaving early. Well, my friend was pretty pissed about what happened and texted saying that I was an asshole for starting a discussion which I knew very well his gf would be left out of and that we never discuss our school materials at parties, so I must've done this purposefully. I told him that this was a special occasion considering our final term of the year and the graduation exam are coming and that it was his choice to take his gf to a party full of med school students knowing very well she wouldn't been able to fit there. \n\nHe said she was fitting more than fine till I decided to go on a power trip and I should apologize to her for making her feel excluded.

Throw in the fact that you are clearly in love with your best friend and tried to belittle his girlfriend by not so subtly centring the conversation around you being smart enough to be in med school to make her feel less than you and it sounds like something straight from Greys anatomy. \n\nAlso... do you know how pathetic it is to look down on professions just because they are different to your own.

Look a the way you even started this post. Really nothing much to say here, you fit to a T on this one.", "You are very much the AH for how you talk about her. Very much so", "Let me guess... you're single.

That was a shit move. \n\nEventually you ALL are going to need a network of friends and family who aren't part of your medical field or you'll burn out and lose your minds. Is your intent to haze everyone who shows up from the outside? Or did you give her special treatment out of some particular feeling of jealousy? YTA either way.", "YTA. You say \"she has no other plans in life\" as if taking over her parent's bakery is nothing. If my parents had a bakery then of course I'd love to take it over one day knowing the ins and out of the business. Calling her a dumb blonde too? Yeah, YTA. The entire post was condescending. You knew what you were doing at that little party.\n\nYou're bitter and jealous that your best friend didn't choose you.", "YTA.\nYou are the embodiment of what gives med students a bad reputation. It doesn't have to be your whole identity. \n\nOf course she'll be left out of the conversation when you discuss what you study, but that:\n\n1. Has absolutely zero to do with intellect\n2. Has everything to do with medicine not being her line of work/study\n\nAccording to your logic, med students can only date and hang out with other med students. Damn that sounds so boring. \n\nStop making your friends girlfriend feel left out. Try getting to know her. You might learn something.

Of course YTA.  Your condescending tone gave it away.", "YTA- you made a conscious choice to bring up a subject that she would not be able to follow along.  She had no problem before that, she had no problem with anyone else.  You do come across as a very stuck up person who thinks they are better then others. Running a business isn't something a dumb person does, or aspires too. Running a bakery takes long hours, its hot and takes alot of physical effort.  So shows you dont know much about certain subjects, I am sure if she spoke about what she does you'd not follow a long either.  Arrogance does not look good on anyone.", "There's a lot more to being successful than academic prowess. How awful will your bedside manner be when you are so condescending and dismissive of others?\n\nYou think you're better than her but you're showing your friend the very opposite is true.\n\nIf you valued your friend's happiness, you would understand that we don't all seek out clones of ourselves as partners, and that period who are quite different can make each other very happy.\n\nIf you valued his friendship you would make a real effort for the woman he is dating.\n\nYour friend is right that if you had been trying, you could easily have avoided excluding his GF at the party even if everyone else there were med students.\n\nYou are making excuses, and from what you've written I think you know it but are clinging to a delusion that she's not good enough for him.", "YTA, and arrogant, snobby, cliquish, and insincere. You change the subject to make yourself feel better about yourself and make her feel less. There is nothing wrong with taking over a bakery.

The best thing is you showed him your true colors, so he sees who you are now...petty.", "YTA. By your own admission, nobody discusses school stuff at these parties and she was being included in conversations before then. And even if we believe you, that you didn't do it on purpose, when you realised she was being left out, you should have changed the topic. \n\nAlso, I don't see how she can be a 'stereotypical bimbo' if she works in a bakery and is business minded enough to plan to take it over. Working in a bakery is actually quite tough - she is unlikely to be doing the job in heels, long nails and a full face of make up (although more power to her if she is) but it suggests that your issue with her is that she's attractive, nothing else, and you're trying to dismiss her as being dumb even though you've got no evidence to back it up. \n\nNot everyone is a med student. That doesn't make them dumb or lesser than you. And if you're this jealous of your alleged best friend's girlfriend, you either are massively insecure about yourself or in love with your best friend.", "YTA Why can't medical school students learn to talk about ANYTHING else when they are around other people?

He knows about it too, but he's funding your petty power trip really unattractive. I mean, he chose his baker girlfriend over you, and he is actively chosing her over you all over.

Girly pop you are a student, you have *peers* not colleagues.", "Oh that\u2019ll be fine - she clearly only feels the need to tear down other people\u2019s intelligence if they\u2019re a threat to her romantically \ud83d\ude43", "She\u2019s definitely a pick me girl who\u2019s into her guy best friend.

I can't imagine how one-sided most of their conversations must be.\"\n\nPer her response to someone else's comments.\n\nThis is what makes me think she might want him. She's super concerned about him having an \"equal partner\" I think it's DEFINITELY a superiority complex but maybe a bit of both.", "YTA OP many here are sure you have a thing for your bff because all your post was putting down a woman you don\u2019t know. Just because she\u2019s not going to be a doctor doesn\u2019t make her dumb. Saying this is also insulting to your bff because if he only likes her for her looks he\u2019s just a shallow guy. \n\nMaybe, you should consider to apologize to both of them, because according to your post everyone was having a good time talking other topics until you try to make obvious that she\u2019s not \u201cpart\u201d of the group.

Are you always this rude to the extent that you\u2019ve forgotten how to behave in public?", "Her friend pointed out that she diesbt normally talk school at parroed and she clearly lingered on it long enough to make the friend and his GF uncomfortable. \n\nYou dont exclude people by having a long conversation about things they cant talk about...not when you can literally talk to your friends about it every single day of the week.", "A ton of my clients have very, very negative experiences with power tripping psychiatrists. \n\n\n\nLike, I kinda get it? A lot of people who become doctors have it pushed by their families from a young age, med school is the ultimate pressure cooker and you have to train for years, and the environment is so abusive it'd incredibly difficult to avoid internalizing the assholery you're surrounded by. \n\n\n\nI mean OP is over here basically saying she doesn't know how to talk to people if it's not \"intellectual\" (a very, very narrow kind of intellectual, to boot.) \n\n\n\nBut yeah. Rough seeing somebody like OP boldly becoming part of the problem.", "I came to say something similar. They turn into people who make up their mind about whatever is wrong with you (even if it\u2019s wrong) and you are drug seeking/making things up/exaggerating if you say that it\u2019s not that problem and you are experiencing those symptoms. \n\nSo for anyone who has a dr like this: you are allowed to fire your dr for any reason.

But OP terms to me to really bot understand that there's much, mu h more to running a successful bakery than selling things over the counter.

Unfortunately OP proved what I just said, as medical students tend to be a rather hermetic group.

I work in HR, at a higher ed institution that's focused on grad programs (we only have 1 undergrad program and it's basically \"I want to do one of the grad programs and need to finish my undergrad first\"). You can't swing a cat without hitting three people with masters degrees and at least one PhD.\n\nAnd yet these people have the absolute worst workplace behavior I've ever seen. Utter disdain for professional communication standards, rude af, seem to honestly believe themselves above doing any kind of administrative tasks at all and just expect us mere mortals with fewer initials after our names to handle everything for them. My HR colleagues and I have wondered occasionally if some of these people have literally ever held a single non-academia job, and debated adding a required qualification for all jobs across the university: minimum 2 years of work in the real world, where their academic prowess means fuckall, so they have to learn how to interact with other human beings.", "Would multiplying the ingredients by .4 give you just four muffins, do you think? That\u2019s what I did for a butter chicken recipe that I only had half the chicken for so I just halved every other ingredient and it was good (but I know cooking\u2019s WAY more forgiving than baking).", "Same!
