Fin clearly sees Anna as a parent and it\u2019s unfair to him to take that away because some guy feels threatened by your relationship with an ex. Tell him he can shape up or ship out!", "NTA. \nThe way you coparent with your ex is admirable because you both prioritise what is good for the kid. \n\nYou should really focus on that: your son gets to spend as much time as HE likes with someone who has been in his life since they can remember. They don\u2019t share DNA but she sounds like she has been a parent to him in every other way.\n\nThe insecurities or worldview of your bf are nonsensical in the grand scheme of things. The emotional stability you and Anna offer your son, despite the outcome of your relationship is the only thing that matters. \n\nIf you had adopted your son (so not related to either of you), would he expect you to be out of his life coz he doesn\u2019t share your DNA or not coparent with Anna? Families come in different forms and sizes and raising happy, healthy kids is all that matters in my view.\n\nYou are not in the wrong here, not for a second and anyone who can\u2019t respect your choices regarding how and with whom you raise your son is probably best kept at arm\u2019s length from your family.", "It's only 'weird' for people who secretly think it's weird to have same-sex relationships.

To deny him someone he thinks of as a parent would be hard. This guy needs to get over himself", "NTA you're considering your kid. He's being insecure and petty.", "Don\u2019t stop your son having another loving parent in his life because of your new partners insecurity \n\nNTA", "NTA. You're doing what's best for your child, plain and simple. Also, it would be so cruel for you to force Anna out of your son's life just because your romantic relationship is over. So many people don't understand that being a good parent is doing what's best for the child, even if it's slightly uncomfortable.", "NTA. It\u2019s not weird you need some better friends and certainly a better partner.", "NTA\n\nThere are many forms of families, and it seems like he doesn't understand, nor can he accept the kind of family dynamic that you have with Anna and your son. My view is that whether he accepts ot or not, that's just the family you have and it has worked for all of you for all these years. If he can't get on board with it, best just show him the door. There are other men to date, your son only has Anna to call mama.", "NTA - As a mom your job is to do what is best for your child. Anna is his parent, she earned it by sticking around even after your break up. The fact that people are finding it weird shows what great parents they are \u2026 (irony obv). I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something you can compromise on because if you did it would affect your son. Unfortunately I don\u2019t think your relationship with Adam is going to work out if he can\u2019t accept this.", "NTA Good for you for making your child\u2019s well being your priority. I think Alan is insecure about your bi status and he\u2019s being a dick about it. If he's making you feel weird now, it\u2019ll only get worse in time.", "NTA. It's irrelevant what all the \"grown ups\" think about whether it is strange or not. What your son thinks and wants is the only thing that matters here. Keep Anna, bin off the bf.", "Yes that was exactly my thought. That just because she isn\u2019t biologically his mother doesn\u2019t mean that she isn\u2019t his parent. He has always known her as a parent. But it seems like everyone else thinks it\u2019s weird bc she hasn\u2019t been in his life since birth or something but that doesn\u2019t matter to either of us. He is her son as well as mine in my eyes.", "It never really occurred to me that that might be an issue since I\u2019ve been open about being bi but if this is an issue for him our relationship won\u2019t work out.", "It's not weird at all. You know what your son needs and both you and Anna are able to give him that love and security. F*** everyone who is telling you to cut her out of his life for the sake of some dude who can't handle anything outside his little square box.", "I've known opposite sex couples with similar arrangements (2 total so small sample). People still thought it was weird. I'm not saying there isn't homophobia or biphobia at play. Absolutely a possibility. Just offering my experience. Also, as someone whose parent split from a partner after about10 years together you are doing a great thing. It hurts like hell to loss a chunk of the family you've know all at once. It screwed with my head more than I realized at the time. Good for you and your ex that you can put the kid first.", "NTA and this is a major red flag.", "NTA. Congratulations for being a considerate person. This is the deal you made and it works for you. Tell them it\u2019s not their business. Tell the bf that he should take some time to mull this situation over because it\u2019s unlikely to change and if he can\u2019t get on board, then it\u2019s not likely to work out and there is no sense wasting time and emotional energy.", "NTA.  It's not weird.  You and Anna acted like ADULTS when you separated and you recognized the bond that exists between Fin and Anna and didn't cut her out of his life.  Good for you!  A parent who is looking out for her child.  Adam doesn't get a say.   Kudos to you!", "NTA \n\nNot weird either. What's weird is how he's hung up on this. You're amazing for your stance on this and putting your son first.", "Lol not at all. If Anna was Alan, the bf would probably be ok with Alan getting visitation until he realised he is not the birth father. If anything he was more tolerant Because it was a same sex relationship on the sense that he knew Anna was obviously not biologically related to the child but was still ok with her having a parental role. \nNot many people would be ok with an ex without biological links having contact with their current child and partner (not that I think this is right, but just stating how it usually is)", "The people who view her as less of a parent don\u2019t matter, and their opinions on your situation matter even less. I wonder if their inability to see Anna as Fin\u2019s other parent is partially due to homophobia? Regardless, Fin loves her as a parent and your dedication to doing what\u2019s best for him is admirable."]}
