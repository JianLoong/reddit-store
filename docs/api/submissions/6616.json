You and your wife really need to to calmly discuss this and not let it drive you apart.\n\nMy guess is that she isn't \"reminded of something so horrible\" -- she's reminded of happy childhood memories, and the name could be part of her healing from something that is no doubt painful for her. If you can, the two of you should discuss it with a neutral third party, like a counselor or therapist. No matter what you decide to name your son, it sounds as if your wife has some unresolved issues and could benefit from some help.", "NTA\n\nShe lied about it because she knew you wouldn\u2019t like it. \n\nI get the feeling that you still don\u2019t have the full story on her history with Pete. If he was such an important FRIEND that she wants to name her child after him, why has she never mentioned him before now?\n\nPete sounds like a dead EX, not a dead friend. Even if he\u2019s not, he was obviously a big enough part of her life for her mom to instantly get the reference, and it\u2019s not really a good sign that your wife has been apparently hiding significant portions of her history from you.", "NTA your wife didn't tell you about the meaning because she knew you wouldn't like it, she lied by omission and that's a conversation you need to have.", "NTA. It has to be a name you both agree on. If one of you says \"no\" to a name then you should pick another name that you both agree on.", "NTA. You deserved to know who your wife was naming your child after before she settled on the name. Pete may have been a great guy but that doesn't mean you have to honor his memory through your son, especially if you find other things that you may not want associated with your child.", "NTA", "Nta, you didn't know the context of the name before agreeing to it, she should have informed you when she suggested the name", "NTA. However, everyone I\u2019ve met named after someone lost under tragic circumstances hated the story behind their name.", "NTA (- or No one is an AH?). I understand why she didn\u2019t tell you. But I also understand that you deserve to know and she should have told you. I have friends who were in a similar position. They settled on the friend\u2019s name who passed to be used as a middle name.  Question, if your wife couldn\u2019t tell you because it\u2019s difficult to talk about him, what is going to happen when she is suddenly using that name every day. It\u2019s obviously a painful memory and she is going to be constantly reminded of it - no way around it. Perhaps the middle name would be better as it\u2019s still a nice remembrance but you don\u2019t have it in your face every day? Give her a little grace right now.  Talk it out honestly and come to a mutual agreement. Congrats to both of you!", "NTA Idk how everyone is saying ESH or YTA.", "NTA. Your wife was being sneaky here. And the child's permanent name is not something to lie to you about. It needs to be a decision by both parents. There are millions of other ways she can pay tribute. Let the child be his own person \n\nAll these people saying  you're the asshole are getting caught up in you using the word addict, or the fact you like the name itself. There are a million names, but would your wife be ok with you choosing a name of some person she never met? And not even telling her? That would not be fair to the child.", "This one's though. I'm gonna say ESH, but with sympathy. You should've known, it's that simple, and your wife not telling you is a bit of a red flag. If it's that hard to talk about, it's going to be that hard to see your child's name. Pulling the wool over your eyes wasn't going to do her any favors the first time she broke down crying because the name was triggering. She needs therapy. Grief is weird, but she definitely needs it. \n\nYour attitude towards addicts? Also not cool. Addiction sucks. I don't think the name being that of an \"addict\" should be the part you're focusing on. You need to focus on actually helping your wife heal and you both need to make sure there's a healthy, mutually-informed decision for naming both this kid and any future kids.", "Soft YTA. Addiction is a disease and dismissing someone's life because they died an addict is callous. Your wife doesn't want to remember Pete's addiction and death - she wants to honour who he was aside from that. You need to check your attitude about addiction my dude. \n\nHowever - you do need to agree on a name. This is the name of someone who clearly meant a lot to your wife, and she only wants to use it as a middle name, so think carefully about vetoing it. But ultimately you must agree.\n\nBut mainly, have some compassion for people who struggle with substance abuse. That could be any one of us.", "NTA. \n\nDon't do it. I was named after a relative of my mother who died in a violent crime, my older brother's middle name is the name of a child my mom had before him that passed away, and I've been uncomfortable about her way of 'honoring' these dead relatives my entire life. I'm working on legally changing my name and it's partially because of this. Tell her to think about how it'll impact your child.", "Everybody sucks here.\nShe should have told you about him. But your reason of \"I don't want to name my child after a drug addict\" is really callous, he was her best friend, who had mental health issues which ended up killing him.", "NTA. To have not even told you WHY she picked that name was wrong.  To not even generically say it was a friend who died is wrong\u2026that she picked it to honor someone. Sounds like she acted like it was out of thin air which is a serious lie of omission.   She says she didn\u2019t tell you because it\u2019s hard to talk about YET she predicts no issues with calling out this name the entire life of your child.  I don\u2019t think so.  Maybe a fair compromise is using that as a middle name.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s just too big of a secret to keep from your own husband about too big of a decision. The stakes were wayyyy to high on all fronts. \n\nYou\u2019re focusing on the drugs side of this, which is by far the least of the things you should be concerned about.", "ESH\n\nYour wife not informing about the best friend who died before the marriage because it is hard, is a very big red flag. Could have just told you to ask her parents reg that, which you did and they told what happened.\n\nNaming a child due to a dead relative/friend, unless it is agreed up by both parents, it is definitely going to cause some serious problem in your relations but not to the child. It is a generic enough name that nobody is going to associate it with a dead person outside of your immediate family that too for a few year after which the child will have his/her own stories to get associated with the name.\n\nAddiction is not a big deal breaker man.\n\nJust because a person is addicted does not mean he is equivalent to a serial killer or some psycho, and that his name is a big taboo.", "Im going to say ESH on this\n\nThe fact you weren\u2019t told the name meant something to her and everyone she knows is pretty dumb to be honest, it was always going to come out. \n\nThe fact you liked the name originally and decided that because an addict had the same name makes you come off as a bit of a AH. It\u2019s only a middle name, they\u2019ll never be called by their middle name and if it means so much to your wife let her have it. \n\nNaming kids is hard but is it worth being bitter about it for the rest of your lives?", "YTA for not liking the name anymore because it comes from someone that struggled with addiction. I agree that she should have brought up the story if she wanted to name him after someone she lost before meeting you, but your reasoning for him being an addict as why you don't want him named after your wife's friend is very wrong. Especially because based on the timeline \"Pete\" was just a kid at the time of his passing.", "NTA weird as hell to name after a dead friend. This child has nothing at all to do with your dead friend, stop mixing things up.", "Y T A for the way you talk about Pete but NTA for no longer liking the name. Names have to be agreed by both parents and she left out a pretty crucial piece of information when you gave it the green light initially. It's okay that this has changed how you feel about the name.\n\nMaybe use Pete as a middle name and select a new first name together?", "NTA. You'll save yourself from telling your son the reason behind his name. Regardless of how Pete lived his life, I think it's unfair on your part. Not to mention you don't know that guy. If your wife doesn't budge, why not get a pet and name it after Pete instead?", "YTA. Not because you disagree about the name but because of your callous and ignorant attitude to addicts as you call them.", ">While I understand the sentiment I don\u2019t want my son carrying the name of not only someone my wife lost but also an addict. \n\nThat's a very judgemental reason, but still NTA. Both parents have a say in the name of the child and both should be comfortable with the final decision, even if your reasons aren't the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying you should have to agree with the name, but consider that Pete was a person to your wife, not just an addict, and that people are more than just their afflictions.", "NTA the fact you were finalizing your name choices together and this NEVER CAME UP as likely her main reason for choosing the name, is horrible of her. You shouldn't have to be reminded of that very weird omission of truth by your life partner anymore.", "NTA \n\n\nYour wife was not honest about her reasoning for this name. She never mentioned this person in the years you knew her. You found out now, but what if you found out after the kid was born? Or when the kid was older? If the kid is around Mom's family, he's going to find out who he's named after. \n\n\nAlso, if she finds it so hard to talk about that she never mentioned Pete to her husband she's known for 4 years, I worry that she's going to have a lot of baggage with the name when she refers to her son by it.", "YTA. There's *millions* of Pete's out there. Pick one and honor that one while letting your wife honor hers.", "I\u2019m not really following your wife\u2019s logic with this. It\u2019s too hard to talk about Pete, even though he apparently meant a lot to her, but it isn\u2019t too hard to say and hear his name every day? In any case you\u2019re NTA. You agreed under false pretenses and names are a two-yes, one-no situation.", "NTA for not liking the name anymore. People in these comments are pretending like the history isn\u2019t a big deal when it most certainly is. \n\nIt\u2019s a completely valid reason to not like the name anymore bc it feels like a random token that your wife literally never mentioned. (If it\u2019s difficult for her to talk about, i literally have no idea how she\u2019d suddenly be able to call the kid that every day). \n\nYou\u2019re kinda an asshole, though, for the whole addict comment.", "NTA.", "YTA. You liked the name just fine and clearly she\u2019s not reminded of something horrible. She\u2019s reminded of someone she knew and loved and admired as a person before he suffered from addiction. You didn\u2019t know him. She did. Don\u2019t reduce his life to the disease that ended it.", "You liked the name until you learned about her friend. As you said, you never knew him. For her it has meaning, for you it doesn't. I fail to see the problem here since you liked the name.", "I will go with \"Everybody sucks\" in this situation, but I understand where everyone is coming from.", "No is TA but also OP the soft TA\n\nI think you miss the point the name behind the reason and it\u2019s not to name behind a drug user but the once who was memorial.\n\n\nI had this similar situation over year ago.  Me and my husband was thinking baby names and he thought of his favorite actor he likes and that actor had a similar name to an exchange student my family took in for the school year.  We were all really close to him, even up to he had to head back home and would contact him days after.  Till suddenly, he never responded back again.  We miss him and none of his family ever reach back out to tell us if he is okay but we all miss him.  So I asked my husband if we could name our son with that name for we always felt the person behind that name was part of the family.\n\nI think that\u2019s the problem, the lack of communication between you two and maybe you two need to find a mild ground to agree on.", "I'm going with ESH\n\n\nYour wife - For not ever sharing about the loss of her best friend.  You are hearing about him now and in a way that ruins it for you.\n\n\nYou - look my daughters middle name is that of my best friend who died at 18.  My middle name is that of my mother's cousin who passed before I was born.  My best friend wasn't perfect but she was still an amazing person who had a profound effect on my life.  It was my way of honoring her and felt as though it made it so she was never forgotten.  If I were to have had a son, I would have given him the middle name of my best friend who died of suicide.  I talk to my daughter about my close friends who passed and I talk about all the good, it honestly makes grieving a tiny bit less painful for me.\n\n\nHer best friend wasn't an addict for their whole friendship.  Being an addict was a small part of who he was.  Do you think your wife will be telling your kid all the bad stuff about where the name came from, or all the good stuff from her childhood? Do you know how many addicts have the same first name as you and your son? I feel like no one is perfect and your hang up is addict and someone your wife lost.  For me it sounds like this is more about a man in her life that she was close with that you knew nothing about.", "ESH - Honestly, your reasoning sucks.  Doesn't matter if he was an addict, a cancer victim, or died in a blimp accident over Shae stadium, he was someone important to your wife.  However, it's such a selfish thing to do, considering it wasn't something that was mutually discussed and agreed upon through open and honest conversation.  A child's name should have a meaning that BOTH parents can get behind.  Lying through omission is a big fucking deal, especially over something of this magnitude.  Marriage counselling right now, or this marriage is doomed.", "YTA- u had no problem with the name originally", "YTA, obviously. Like so obviously.", "ESH  she should have informed you, you for changing your mind for the reasons listed, especially the latter.", "Soft ESH ( first time I give this vote): she should have told you and you shouldn't discard the name just because of that. Sit down and calmly talk about it.", "YTA.\n\nYou assume that your wife will be reminded of something horrible. Frankly,  I think it's the opposite.  She will be reminded of a person who has been with her for many years. A person she loved and cherished.\n\nAs for the addict part...not sure why that's an issue. Not like that name is well known as being associated to drugs. It's not like it's \"Adolf\" where it's immediately associated to something unpleasant.", "NTA - your wife deceived you, but there is no winning this one. She carries the baby to term and that\u2019s the trump card, no beating that.", "YTA.\n\nYou say that you 'understand the sentiment' but then say you \"don't get why\" she wants to be reminded of this other person. So which is it? Do you understand the sentiment of naming someone after someone you know, or don't you? Keep in mind that if you name your kid after *anyone* else, you do so knowing you will lose their namesake (if you haven't already).\n\nAlso... addiction is a serious neurological disorder that society has been treating like a moral or behavioral problem. But it's not. It's a disorder. That's what makes you TA here. You find out the kid's namesake was an addict now the name is 'tainted' for you, even though you previously agreed to it.", "YTA, the name doesn\u2019t carry any actual significance to you. It does mean something to your wife, so the only thing you\u2019re accomplishing is taking something from her. No matter what name you choose, there are thousands of dead addicts who had that name, so as far as your logic is concerned no name would be acceptable. It doesn\u2019t matter that your wife knew someone with the name Pete, who happened to have an addiction, you didn\u2019t. He clearly had an impact on her life, she should be able to mourn/respect/ whatever him in her way.\nShould that entire topic have come up over the course of 5 years, yeah, but I can see why it hasn\u2019t.", "YTA. You liked the name before finding out what it meant to your wife. Being an addict doesn\u2019t make someone a bad person like your implying here. Your wife doesn\u2019t see him as an addict, they were best friends through childhood that had a lot of happy memories and your just dismissing all of that because you heard the word addict and it\u2019s a wonder why she never told you in the first place since your doing exactly what she thought you would.\n\nAddiction is a disease that so many people don\u2019t get help for, my father was an addict my whole life, and never got the help he needed and he died as a result of that, his addiction didn\u2019t make him a bad person, he was a great father and people like you dismissed him because of that word, \u201caddiction \u201c do better op, you and your wife need therapy.", "YTA - you were happy with the name before.

From someone who had an addiction who could have killed her, I get your point and would not be angry against my sister's husband if they had a baby and he wouldn't want to name her after me.

At the end of the day, naming a child is a two way decision, if you\u2019re not happy with the name anymore then you shouldn\u2019t be forced into it.

It\u2019s likely there was a myriad of problems and that Pete had a hard life. \n\nI think you and your wife need to have a serious discussion about this.

I believe all addicts deserve second chance and help, but the whole attitude of over-forgiving and overseeing of their actions irritate me. They do no deserve more \"sympathy\" or \"honouring\" or \"compassion\" *simply* because they are addicts (it's another story to those who quit or try to, but that's iralevent here). \n\nOP's opinion wasn't cruel or unjust toward Pete, who was a total stranger to him. Op also did NOT dismiss anything.All he suddenly knows about this stranger is that he was an addict and was dead because of it.

Commenter above means he should have known the reasoning behind his wife wanting to name the child Pete from the get-go.", "WanderlustCryptid means wife should have told OP, not that he should have magically figured it out.", "They don\u2019t deserve sympathy, compassion, and being honored for being an addict, no. They deserve that for being a person. His life was not less valuable, or less important, for his being an addict, and clearly he had people who loved him.", "I think the point here is that it doesn't matter that he was an addict, and is wrong to consider that shameful and as a reason against the name. If they do not want their child named after someone who passed they never knew, that is valid and should be discussed. But the element of the individual being an addict should not be the reason against it.", "good talk", "The child for one is going to wonder why he was named that.", "Pete has been dead for 7 years, OP and his wife have known each other for 4 years. At no point in time did she ever mention a Pete. \n\nEither he wasn\u2019t an important enough person in her life to be worth having a fight to name her child after him, or he was a lot more than just a friend to her. \n\nEither way, OP is 100% right to not want to name his kid after Pete.", "Exactly. Also the point of the therapist is to keep the conversation safe and healthy so that it\u2019s not filled with hurtful and hateful accusations and comments, but is a healthy, beneficial conversation.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing that the wife is in the wrong about not telling her husband about it. I find it VERY odd that in the 4 years together it never got brought up. (Sorry, I mentioned this in another comment but didn\u2019t want to regurgitate the same thing again).\n\nThe child will still be their own person, whether they are named after someone or not. My middle name is my great aunt\u2019s name. I never knew her, but I was named in \u201ctribute\u201d to her. It literally had zero effect on my life and when I learned it was after someone my mom really cared about and not just a random name, I loved it even more. I don\u2019t understand the logic that having a middle name chosen to as an honor to someone the parents cared about means that you have to \u201cfill that person\u2019s shoes\u201d or that they can\u2019t be themselves because their middle name is the same name as someone else. My brother\u2019s middle name is my dad\u2019s first name; my son\u2019s middle name is his father\u2019s grandfather\u2019s first name. It\u2019s a common practice and it seems silly to think that I expect my son to be the \u201cimage\u201d of his great grandfather just because they have a name in common. Again, I\u2019m in absolute agreement that the wife should have mentioned it before, and it seems very odd that in a 4 year relationship a largely traumatic and important event was never talked about.", "Nowhere in the post does it say he\u2019s her ex? He\u2019s just her childhood friend. Of course you wouldn\u2019t name someone after your ex.", "That's how I understood it. Why should they have known about something that wasn't said.", "That I'd get behind but that's not how I read it.", "My phrasing was misleading, i edited it. What i meant is they don't deserve extra sympathy or honouring simply because of addiction, which seems like many people think they do.\n\nNeither me or op said they, or Pete, are less valuable. Once again, OP did not dismiss their life, neither do i.\n\nIm saying op is nta because 1) he didn't dimiss anything 2) he is completely reasonable to not want to name his child after a stranger killed by his own addiction", ">I think the point here is that it doesn't matter that he was an addict\n\nYes it does. You wouldn't name your child after someone who's made choices that you don't agree with. OP had no prior knowledge of the person and was only told about them after the decision was made. The persons actions during their life definitely changes how they're viewed when they're dead. \n\n>wrong to consider that shameful and as a reason against the name\n\nDisagree. This is OP's child and we don't get to force our morals on them or that childs name.", "Yeah and mum can tell the story of someone great who she grew up with and loved", "Wow that\u2019s a crazy accusation. My best friend passed away last year and I would never bring her up to someone who didn\u2019t know her because it\u2019s a horrible story.

They're saying she should have told him, not expecting him to guess. Their phrasing sounds like they're putting the responsibility on him, but that's not what they actually mean.", "Speaking nothing but facts", "The baby didn't ask for that. Let him be his own person. Or at least let both parents agreed.", "It\u2019s her HUSBAND. Not some random person. \n\nPete had been dead for 3 years before she even met OP, and it\u2019s been 7 years since his death. \n\nIf she wants to name THEIR kid after Pete, she should have been able to have a conversation with OP about who Pete was. \n\nYou\u2019re justified in not wanting to talk to people about your dead friend, but you\u2019re an AH if you think you can name your future children after your friend without actually telling your spouse about them. \n\nSpouse and parent of future children is \u201cdeserves to know\u201d status. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy that that you think differently.

And now you see why OP's NTA, even if his view on addiction is negative.", "Ah I get you. I see where that might be a confusing word choice.", "He shouldn't be defined by deceit between parents either.", "> but I doubt she was intentionally hiding it\n\n\nBruh what?\n\nIt\u2019s her childhood \u201cfriend\u201d that she apparently cares enough about to want to name her first born child after, but she\u2019s never even mentioned him to her husband that she has known for 4 years. \n\nWhat world are you living in where this isn\u2019t obviously her intentionally hiding it?\n\nYou don\u2019t just accidentally name your children after an ex, whose name your family members instantly recognize, while not telling your spouse about their existence in the 4 years you\u2019ve been together. \n\nHe is not an asshole. She lied to him about all of this, and he is perfectly justified in changing his mind when he gets (what is obviously only some of) the facts. \n\nShe is still lying to him about her relationship with Pete.", "You\u2019re literally just making up that he\u2019s her ex but whatever I get it you don\u2019t support your partners you\u2019ve never lost anyone tragically whatever, im going to bed.", "If Pete was actually just a friend, why would she never mention him to her husband in the 4 years that they\u2019ve known each other?  \n\nWhy did her HUSBAND not have any idea who the person she wanted to name their first born child was?\n\nThat\u2019s her fucking husband. He should be able to recognize the name of someone important enough in her life for her to want to name a child after him. \n\nThe fact that they\u2019ve been together for 4 years and he still had no idea who Pete was is a massive red flag.", "Maybe because he obviously has a stick up his ass about drug users?"]}
