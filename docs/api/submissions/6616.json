You and your wife really need to to calmly discuss this and not let it drive you apart.\n\nMy guess is that she isn't \"reminded of something so horrible\" -- she's reminded of happy childhood memories, and the name could be part of her healing from something that is no doubt painful for her. If you can, the two of you should discuss it with a neutral third party, like a counselor or therapist. No matter what you decide to name your son, it sounds as if your wife has some unresolved issues and could benefit from some help.", "NTA\n\nShe lied about it because she knew you wouldn\u2019t like it. \n\nI get the feeling that you still don\u2019t have the full story on her history with Pete. If he was such an important FRIEND that she wants to name her child after him, why has she never mentioned him before now?\n\nPete sounds like a dead EX, not a dead friend. Even if he\u2019s not, he was obviously a big enough part of her life for her mom to instantly get the reference, and it\u2019s not really a good sign that your wife has been apparently hiding significant portions of her history from you.", "NTA your wife didn't tell you about the meaning because she knew you wouldn't like it, she lied by omission and that's a conversation you need to have.", "NTA. It has to be a name you both agree on. If one of you says \"no\" to a name then you should pick another name that you both agree on.", "NTA. You deserved to know who your wife was naming your child after before she settled on the name. Pete may have been a great guy but that doesn't mean you have to honor his memory through your son, especially if you find other things that you may not want associated with your child.", "NTA", "Nta, you didn't know the context of the name before agreeing to it, she should have informed you when she suggested the name", "NTA. However, everyone I\u2019ve met named after someone lost under tragic circumstances hated the story behind their name.", "NTA (- or No one is an AH?). I understand why she didn\u2019t tell you. But I also understand that you deserve to know and she should have told you. I have friends who were in a similar position. They settled on the friend\u2019s name who passed to be used as a middle name.  Question, if your wife couldn\u2019t tell you because it\u2019s difficult to talk about him, what is going to happen when she is suddenly using that name every day. It\u2019s obviously a painful memory and she is going to be constantly reminded of it - no way around it. Perhaps the middle name would be better as it\u2019s still a nice remembrance but you don\u2019t have it in your face every day? Give her a little grace right now.  Talk it out honestly and come to a mutual agreement. Congrats to both of you!", "NTA Idk how everyone is saying ESH or YTA.", "NTA. Your wife was being sneaky here. And the child's permanent name is not something to lie to you about. It needs to be a decision by both parents. There are millions of other ways she can pay tribute. Let the child be his own person \n\nAll these people saying  you're the asshole are getting caught up in you using the word addict, or the fact you like the name itself. There are a million names, but would your wife be ok with you choosing a name of some person she never met? And not even telling her? That would not be fair to the child.", "This one's though. I'm gonna say ESH, but with sympathy. You should've known, it's that simple, and your wife not telling you is a bit of a red flag. If it's that hard to talk about, it's going to be that hard to see your child's name. Pulling the wool over your eyes wasn't going to do her any favors the first time she broke down crying because the name was triggering. She needs therapy. Grief is weird, but she definitely needs it. \n\nYour attitude towards addicts? Also not cool. Addiction sucks. I don't think the name being that of an \"addict\" should be the part you're focusing on. You need to focus on actually helping your wife heal and you both need to make sure there's a healthy, mutually-informed decision for naming both this kid and any future kids.\n\nETA: You should have known was meant more as wife should've provided that info, not that OP was meant to be psychic. More like \"you deserve to have known.\"", "Soft YTA. Addiction is a disease and dismissing someone's life because they died an addict is callous. Your wife doesn't want to remember Pete's addiction and death - she wants to honour who he was aside from that. You need to check your attitude about addiction my dude. \n\nHowever - you do need to agree on a name. This is the name of someone who clearly meant a lot to your wife, and she only wants to use it as a middle name, so think carefully about vetoing it. But ultimately you must agree.\n\nBut mainly, have some compassion for people who struggle with substance abuse. That could be any one of us.", "NTA. \n\nDon't do it. I was named after a relative of my mother who died in a violent crime, my older brother's middle name is the name of a child my mom had before him that passed away, and I've been uncomfortable about her way of 'honoring' these dead relatives my entire life. I'm working on legally changing my name and it's partially because of this. Tell her to think about how it'll impact your child.", "Everybody sucks here.\nShe should have told you about him. But your reason of \"I don't want to name my child after a drug addict\" is really callous, he was her best friend, who had mental health issues which ended up killing him.", "NTA. To have not even told you WHY she picked that name was wrong.  To not even generically say it was a friend who died is wrong\u2026that she picked it to honor someone. Sounds like she acted like it was out of thin air which is a serious lie of omission.   She says she didn\u2019t tell you because it\u2019s hard to talk about YET she predicts no issues with calling out this name the entire life of your child.  I don\u2019t think so.  Maybe a fair compromise is using that as a middle name.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s just too big of a secret to keep from your own husband about too big of a decision. The stakes were wayyyy to high on all fronts. \n\nYou\u2019re focusing on the drugs side of this, which is by far the least of the things you should be concerned about.", "ESH\n\nYour wife not informing about the best friend who died before the marriage because it is hard, is a very big red flag. Could have just told you to ask her parents reg that, which you did and they told what happened.\n\nNaming a child due to a dead relative/friend, unless it is agreed up by both parents, it is definitely going to cause some serious problem in your relations but not to the child. It is a generic enough name that nobody is going to associate it with a dead person outside of your immediate family that too for a few year after which the child will have his/her own stories to get associated with the name.\n\nAddiction is not a big deal breaker man.\n\nJust because a person is addicted does not mean he is equivalent to a serial killer or some psycho, and that his name is a big taboo.", "Im going to say ESH on this\n\nThe fact you weren\u2019t told the name meant something to her and everyone she knows is pretty dumb to be honest, it was always going to come out. \n\nThe fact you liked the name originally and decided that because an addict had the same name makes you come off as a bit of a AH. It\u2019s only a middle name, they\u2019ll never be called by their middle name and if it means so much to your wife let her have it. \n\nNaming kids is hard but is it worth being bitter about it for the rest of your lives?", "YTA for not liking the name anymore because it comes from someone that struggled with addiction. I agree that she should have brought up the story if she wanted to name him after someone she lost before meeting you, but your reasoning for him being an addict as why you don't want him named after your wife's friend is very wrong. Especially because based on the timeline \"Pete\" was just a kid at the time of his passing.", "NTA weird as hell to name after a dead friend. This child has nothing at all to do with your dead friend, stop mixing things up.", "Y T A for the way you talk about Pete but NTA for no longer liking the name. Names have to be agreed by both parents and she left out a pretty crucial piece of information when you gave it the green light initially. It's okay that this has changed how you feel about the name.\n\nMaybe use Pete as a middle name and select a new first name together?", "NTA. You'll save yourself from telling your son the reason behind his name. Regardless of how Pete lived his life, I think it's unfair on your part. Not to mention you don't know that guy. If your wife doesn't budge, why not get a pet and name it after Pete instead?", "YTA. Not because you disagree about the name but because of your callous and ignorant attitude to addicts as you call them.", ">While I understand the sentiment I don\u2019t want my son carrying the name of not only someone my wife lost but also an addict. \n\nThat's a very judgemental reason, but still NTA. Both parents have a say in the name of the child and both should be comfortable with the final decision, even if your reasons aren't the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying you should have to agree with the name, but consider that Pete was a person to your wife, not just an addict, and that people are more than just their afflictions.", "NTA the fact you were finalizing your name choices together and this NEVER CAME UP as likely her main reason for choosing the name, is horrible of her. You shouldn't have to be reminded of that very weird omission of truth by your life partner anymore.", "NTA \n\n\nYour wife was not honest about her reasoning for this name. She never mentioned this person in the years you knew her. You found out now, but what if you found out after the kid was born? Or when the kid was older? If the kid is around Mom's family, he's going to find out who he's named after. \n\n\nAlso, if she finds it so hard to talk about that she never mentioned Pete to her husband she's known for 4 years, I worry that she's going to have a lot of baggage with the name when she refers to her son by it.", "YTA. There's *millions* of Pete's out there. Pick one and honor that one while letting your wife honor hers.", "I\u2019m not really following your wife\u2019s logic with this. It\u2019s too hard to talk about Pete, even though he apparently meant a lot to her, but it isn\u2019t too hard to say and hear his name every day? In any case you\u2019re NTA. You agreed under false pretenses and names are a two-yes, one-no situation.", "NTA for not liking the name anymore. People in these comments are pretending like the history isn\u2019t a big deal when it most certainly is. \n\nIt\u2019s a completely valid reason to not like the name anymore bc it feels like a random token that your wife literally never mentioned. (If it\u2019s difficult for her to talk about, i literally have no idea how she\u2019d suddenly be able to call the kid that every day). \n\nYou\u2019re kinda an asshole, though, for the whole addict comment.", "NTA.", "YTA. You liked the name just fine and clearly she\u2019s not reminded of something horrible. She\u2019s reminded of someone she knew and loved and admired as a person before he suffered from addiction. You didn\u2019t know him. She did. Don\u2019t reduce his life to the disease that ended it.", "You liked the name until you learned about her friend. As you said, you never knew him. For her it has meaning, for you it doesn't. I fail to see the problem here since you liked the name.", "I will go with \"Everybody sucks\" in this situation, but I understand where everyone is coming from.", "No is TA but also OP the soft TA\n\nI think you miss the point the name behind the reason and it\u2019s not to name behind a drug user but the once who was memorial.\n\n\nI had this similar situation over year ago.  Me and my husband was thinking baby names and he thought of his favorite actor he likes and that actor had a similar name to an exchange student my family took in for the school year.  We were all really close to him, even up to he had to head back home and would contact him days after.  Till suddenly, he never responded back again.  We miss him and none of his family ever reach back out to tell us if he is okay but we all miss him.  So I asked my husband if we could name our son with that name for we always felt the person behind that name was part of the family.\n\nI think that\u2019s the problem, the lack of communication between you two and maybe you two need to find a mild ground to agree on.", "I'm going with ESH\n\n\nYour wife - For not ever sharing about the loss of her best friend.  You are hearing about him now and in a way that ruins it for you.\n\n\nYou - look my daughters middle name is that of my best friend who died at 18.  My middle name is that of my mother's cousin who passed before I was born.  My best friend wasn't perfect but she was still an amazing person who had a profound effect on my life.  It was my way of honoring her and felt as though it made it so she was never forgotten.  If I were to have had a son, I would have given him the middle name of my best friend who died of suicide.  I talk to my daughter about my close friends who passed and I talk about all the good, it honestly makes grieving a tiny bit less painful for me.\n\n\nHer best friend wasn't an addict for their whole friendship.  Being an addict was a small part of who he was.  Do you think your wife will be telling your kid all the bad stuff about where the name came from, or all the good stuff from her childhood? Do you know how many addicts have the same first name as you and your son? I feel like no one is perfect and your hang up is addict and someone your wife lost.  For me it sounds like this is more about a man in her life that she was close with that you knew nothing about.", "ESH - Honestly, your reasoning sucks.  Doesn't matter if he was an addict, a cancer victim, or died in a blimp accident over Shae stadium, he was someone important to your wife.  However, it's such a selfish thing to do, considering it wasn't something that was mutually discussed and agreed upon through open and honest conversation.  A child's name should have a meaning that BOTH parents can get behind.  Lying through omission is a big fucking deal, especially over something of this magnitude.  Marriage counselling right now, or this marriage is doomed.", "YTA- u had no problem with the name originally", "YTA, obviously. Like so obviously.", "ESH  she should have informed you, you for changing your mind for the reasons listed, especially the latter.", "Soft ESH ( first time I give this vote): she should have told you and you shouldn't discard the name just because of that. Sit down and calmly talk about it.", "YTA.\n\nYou assume that your wife will be reminded of something horrible. Frankly,  I think it's the opposite.  She will be reminded of a person who has been with her for many years. A person she loved and cherished.\n\nAs for the addict part...not sure why that's an issue. Not like that name is well known as being associated to drugs. It's not like it's \"Adolf\" where it's immediately associated to something unpleasant.", "NTA - your wife deceived you, but there is no winning this one. She carries the baby to term and that\u2019s the trump card, no beating that.", "YTA.\n\nYou say that you 'understand the sentiment' but then say you \"don't get why\" she wants to be reminded of this other person. So which is it? Do you understand the sentiment of naming someone after someone you know, or don't you? Keep in mind that if you name your kid after *anyone* else, you do so knowing you will lose their namesake (if you haven't already).\n\nAlso... addiction is a serious neurological disorder that society has been treating like a moral or behavioral problem. But it's not. It's a disorder. That's what makes you TA here. You find out the kid's namesake was an addict now the name is 'tainted' for you, even though you previously agreed to it.", "YTA, the name doesn\u2019t carry any actual significance to you. It does mean something to your wife, so the only thing you\u2019re accomplishing is taking something from her. No matter what name you choose, there are thousands of dead addicts who had that name, so as far as your logic is concerned no name would be acceptable. It doesn\u2019t matter that your wife knew someone with the name Pete, who happened to have an addiction, you didn\u2019t. He clearly had an impact on her life, she should be able to mourn/respect/ whatever him in her way.\nShould that entire topic have come up over the course of 5 years, yeah, but I can see why it hasn\u2019t.", "YTA. You liked the name before finding out what it meant to your wife. Being an addict doesn\u2019t make someone a bad person like your implying here. Your wife doesn\u2019t see him as an addict, they were best friends through childhood that had a lot of happy memories and your just dismissing all of that because you heard the word addict and it\u2019s a wonder why she never told you in the first place since your doing exactly what she thought you would.\n\nAddiction is a disease that so many people don\u2019t get help for, my father was an addict my whole life, and never got the help he needed and he died as a result of that, his addiction didn\u2019t make him a bad person, he was a great father and people like you dismissed him because of that word, \u201caddiction \u201c do better op, you and your wife need therapy.", "YTA - you were happy with the name before.

I believe all addicts deserve second chance and help, but the whole attitude of over-forgiving and overseeing of their actions irritate me. They do no deserve more \"sympathy\" or \"honouring\" or \"compassion\" *simply* because they are addicts (it's another story to those who quit or try to, but that's iralevent here). \n\nOP's opinion wasn't cruel or unjust toward Pete, who was a total stranger to him.

Another reason teens get addicted is that even pot can be laced with fentanyl. In my state 3 young people from the same town who only smoked pot randomly died of fentanyl OD.

Addiction is not the person's fault.  \n\n>id have issue honoring a random (to him) person, for whatever reason. \n\nBut it's not at all a random person to him. It's an important person that the mother of his child and wife lost in her youth. Like, my partner lost someone to something similar and wants to name his first born after him, I never met this person, they are 100% random to me, but man I'd be a bitch to deny him that and randomly put up a stink. Imagine if your best friend died of an overdose and your significant other started making a stink over naming your kid to honor them, like, you would not take this whole \"well they are just a random person to me\" as a very valid explanation because they are very much important *to you* and should be to your partner for that reason to.  \n\nIdk, I just can't fathom being that insensitive to my partner's emotions over something as silly as trivial as a *middle name*. \n\n>Let me reverse it, how is this person she has never mentioned to her husband so important that she wants to name their child after him?\n\nBecause she was friends with him in her youth.

I don't necessarily want to hear someone shit talk my dead friend either. \n\nAlso who knows she never mentioned him, I can't imagine she's never mentioned him before. It's very likely she did bring him up at some point as a \"a friend\" in some kind of stories she's told about her youth, she likely has talked about losing a friend, and maybe he just didn't remember these nuggets of details. Which is fine, not everyone remembers everything, but as someone who has been in a number of relationships before I know for a fact that my partners have not ever registered a friend I've talked to them about, or other details of my life and they've claimed later I \"didn't tell them\". Well I did, I just told you in passing or as part of a different story, you just don't remember, which is fine, but sometimes I would be accused of lying or withholding information when it was simply not true. \n\n>Is the name so important that it\u2019s a hill she is willing to die on?\n\nI mean yeah, they were an important person to her. It's definitely more important to her than it is to him. Especially since he *already said he liked the name*. If there is an extra meaning that would be important and make her happy isn't that a bonus? Not a negative?

It\u2019s like when someone overdoses nobody talks about the bad stuff because that would mean that have a \u201cnasty attitude towards addicts,\u201d they say whatever they can to make the person look as good as possible. OP is NTA. I would not want to name my kid after \u201cLexi\u201d when she made so many bad and hurtful decisions that led to her death. She had resources. Rehab was available. Her family was there for her. Yet, she would message everyone of facebook asking for $25 to buy diapers but would go buy more drugs with it instead. I might have loved her as my friend at one point but at the end, she was not that person and I would not want to honor that", "Pete is clearly her first love.  Youre the guy that Rose married after the Titanic.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Pete was more than a friend. People don't name their kids after dead friends of the opposite sex.\n\nThe hivemind here will support you, but no one IRL would. Ask some of **your** friends and family.", "This is nuts. OP doesn't want his wife naming their child after another man, a fact she intentionally concealed from him and you think he's an asshole?", "Or she\u2019s still sad and working through the loss of her childhood best friend.", "I don\u2019t think addict is the issue here I think the issue is that she was willing to name her son Pete after her \u201cbest friend\u201d who passed away years ago even tho her husband didn\u2019t hear a single word from her about this Pete, if he was so important and stuff it would\u2019ve been brought up even before marriage this just seems like a way of honouring a dead ex", "Not only lied by omission, but never mentioned him before. It could\u2019t even imagine never mentioning somebody so important to my wife, despite how hard it is.", ">He didn't choose to be an addict\n\nI mean he kinda did. I don't think anyone force feed/inject him with drugs first. Obviously no one ever wants to be an addict trying it for the first time but...\n\nSaying he is blameless because \"it's an illness so he can't be bad guy\" is wrong. They need all the help they can get and need but part of the problem is they have to admit it. It's even one of the AA steps I believe.", "Right? It\u2019s too hard to talk about but not to hard to say it multiple times a day when you have to summon your child? She knew he wouldn\u2019t be down for that. NTA", "Nah I think op is just weirded out the the name his wife chose had a lot of meaning to her but never brought up anything about Pete before", "This, too, is my hang up. How are you saying \"it's hard to talk about it,\" but also \"let's name our first kid after this person\" in the same breath? It did not make sense to me. \n\nI have lost some great people to suicide and addiction. Some I can't speak of, but i think about them a lot. When it was time to name my kids- never even considered to honor the person they were by naming my kids after them. \n\n\nThere are so many other ways to honor people. \n\n\nAlso, I am immensely against Jr's, 2nd's and 3rd's as well, so I may be a bit biased here.", "I don't disagree with either perspectives, one of which is yours.\n\nThat's why I struggle to fathom how both sides are suddenly for the husband to reconcile with.\n\nWorking through the loss of a friend is something you do till you're comfortable talking to the most important person in your life - your life partner.\n\nIf you haven't even gotten there yet, how does naming a child you both made in that friend's honor, not going to remind you of the trauma you haven't completely worked on?\n\nA name that will likely stay for life? A name the child will ask about in the future?\n\nYou can't have it both ways and then expect it to make sense.", "Wisdom?", "It doesn\u2019t matter how he died. Wife is being shady.", "So? Why would that mean he doesn\u2019t get an honest choice in his child\u2019s name?", ">their namesake was a junkie\n\n*Yuck*", "Yeah, until he found out that his wife was naming \nTHEIR child after somebody from her past. I think most people wouldn't be thrilled that they'd be deceived in this way. And one day little Pete is going to ask about the guy he's named after and find out that he was an addict who died. Now little Pete is carrying that around. In my opinion, people just shouldn't name their kids after other people anyway because it puts pressure on the kid to measure up. Regardless, hiding her intentions here makes OP's wife the asshole.", "https://insight.openexo.com/how-our-name-affects-our-personality-and-identity-what-social-psychology-says/", "Or they could just say \"Mum had a really good friend named Pete when she was a kid.\" and leave it at that.\n\nWhen the kid is an older teen/adult and can understand the details and nuance would be when a conversation about addiction, drug poisoning, and loving a person despite struggles can happen.", "Can you explain where you see a superior attitude from OP in this post? I'm not seeing it.", "Well that\u2019s a interesting point and I am curious to understand your point of view. Could you help me to understand a bit better by copying and pasting the parts of those 5 paragraphs that are dismissive of drug addicts or his wife? But you make an interesting point. I just am not entirely certain it\u2019s a point in the direction you are debating. This woman was so unbelievably close to a person, so indelibly encoded at her core with the friendship she had with Pete, that the husband is literally just hearing about it now AFTER conceiving a child together and being married for 3 years? That sounds remarkably like bullshit to me and certainly not something I would want to focus on if I was trying to minimize the wife\u2019s deceitful behavior. I\u2019m going to lay odds that \u2018Pete\u2019 didn\u2019t get brought up because \u2018Pete\u2019 was the wife\u2019s first love.", "Cause of death is relevant to ops reaction though. I'm sure if Pete had died another ear and one that is seen as \"better\" by op it wouldn't be as big a deal.", "Manipulate? That's laughable."]}
