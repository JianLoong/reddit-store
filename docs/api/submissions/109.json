Then you and he get in a fight and he goes and sleeps with somebody else and gets her pregnant? But you take him back because you're pregnant too? And now his affair partner is giving him jewelry to wear and he thinks it's okay? Did I get that all right? \n\nFirst it's not okay. Second, the man is a pile of red flags, one of them being he's still into the affair partner! Third, she's still into him and has no qualms about going after him right in front of your face. In fact she's straight up trying to drive a wedge between you two! I have a feeling the three of you will be going back and forth many many times if you don't cut it off now. But in the interest of judgment....You: NTA unless you stay with him. Her and him are TAs!", "NTA\nDivorce him and file for child support. Let the one night stand have him.", "ESH. \n\nYou sound like you\u2019re doing a lot of convincing yourself that this was a one night stand. But it doesn\u2019t really sound like the case. For either of them.", "ESH, but ngl I really think you are in for a huge mess if the earring is the only red flag you are pinging on.", "ESH because this whole situation seems like a hot mess and you're bringing 3 kids into it.", "Ex-husband*", "NTA but be careful with Ms. ONS. Sounds like she\u2019d like to drive a wedge between you and husband so she can have more dad resources for herself. You won\u2019t be able to successfully call her out on this because she can hide behind \u201cwe have a kid together\u201d all damn day.", "ESH. What a soup sandwich. Hard pass. Zero stars for your relationship. Maybe you should think about co-parenting yourself and moving on.", "Esh for bringing kids into this toxic af situation. He's probably sleeping with her and/or had been or still is in a relationship with her on the side.", "Info: are any of the children born yet?", "INFO: \u201cmatching earrings for something they have in common\u201d as in they have identical pairs earrings that are some kind of image of a common interest? Or she bought just matching earrings as a symbol of the baby they have in common? \n\nDid he refuse to take them off and tell you that you\u2019re overreacting or did he take them off but say he doesn\u2019t see the problem?", "ESH. this is a shit show from the first sentence.", "ESH\n\nThis sounds like a truly insane mess. You got in an argument (while married) so he leaves for a while and sleeps with someone else???\nAnd you took him back?\n\nYou\u2019re choosing to stay in this mess, and an earring will be the least of your issues.", "NTA. Unless the matching earrings say \"KidsNameMom and KidsNameDad\", he should not be wearing jewelry given to him by or matching the jewelry of an ex when he is married to you. I suspect he understands exactly why you don't do this and just doesn't care, or is enjoying riling you up. Sorry, but he's TA.", "ESH\n\nYou are reacting to the earrings but I don't think that's the issue. He's also being weird and not honest about his feelings for her. You are choosing to stay in a very complicated situation that's about to get more complicated. For the next 18 years. You might want to get counseling to both get straight on his commitment and your jealousy.", "That's his side chick. ESH and this is why you don't marry someone you barely know.", "NAH - Perhaps it is because I regularly work with family issues, but I don't think anyone is the AH here.  The husband messed up by not using protection, but a child happened and there is nothing that can change that.\n\nYour emotions are valid.  I understand why you are upset at seeing the earrings.  They are a reminder of your husband having a connection to another woman.  The earrings aren't going to change that fact though.  Your husband now has a lifetime connection to the other woman.  She will always be a part of your life too, because your children and her child are half-siblings.  Expect to see her pop up at family functions for the rest of your lives.\n\nThe question is how all of the parties are going to move forward.  You have a new stepchild.  Your choice is to try to graciously accept this stepchild and the stepchild's parent into your lives or try to ignore the issue.  \n\nI don't think that ignoring the issue will work.  Resentment may start to build.  Everyone involved needs to openly communicate with one another.  What would be ideal is if everyone can put aside their differences and be friendly with the other.  \n\nTruly, how great would it be for your stepchild to feel like his mother, father, and stepmother all get along well together!  How wonderful would it be for your twins to have a close relationship with their half-sibling, with sleepovers at both houses.  \n\nThere is a lot of hurt right now and so maybe you can reach out to a counselor to help everyone through this together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The husband decided to have sex with her when he was married and they are having a child together. He has not set up any boundaries and is encouraging her to pursue a more involved/romantic relationship. OP got married and pregnant with a man she clearly doesn't know and considering they are both pregnant I wouldn't be surprised if the other woman had a relationship with the man almost as long at this point.
