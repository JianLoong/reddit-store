I have my own kids.\u201d \n**writing on mobile**\n\nContext: \nI\u2019ve (34F) have been in a casual long distance relationship for 2 years with \u201cMatt\u201d (40M). I set boundaries at the start of our relationship. We will never live together, he will not be involved with my kids or family, I won\u2019t be involved in his. My kids have a dad that\u2019s very active in their lives and we coparent amazingly. The relationship I have with Matt is just that, with *him*.  Matt agreed to these terms. Everything has been great. We never argue because we have nothing to argue about. We have our separate lives and when we\u2019re together it\u2019s like a break from the real world. \n\nMatt is relocating closer to me because he\u2019s grown tired of the city and wants to live in a more rural place like I currently live in. He will still be roughly over an hour away so it\u2019s within comfort. His daughter \u201cAva\u201d is 12 and he was unable to leave her home as his mom had a slip and fall and wasn\u2019t comfortable watching Ava while she was on heavy medication, she just wants to rest. He wasn\u2019t comfortable leaving her at the hotel alone so he asked me to watch her. I agreed and we both understood it\u2019s a one time thing. \n\nHe tells Ava I\u2019m an old friend but I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s heard my name before (it\u2019s not a traditional American name) because of what follows.\n\n She was being hateful to my daughter \u201cRose\u201d (11), making fun of the blemishes my daughter has on her chin. I asked Ava if she wanted to go to the basement to play any of the games down there, she said no so I told Rose to go to the basement. She did.\n\nI then catch Ava slowly opening the basement door and I ask her to go to the living room. She refuses and opens the basement door all the way. I tell her she is not allowed down there right now but she\u2019s welcomed to the Wii in the living room or she can pick a movie to stream. We go back and forth, then I walk to the basement door and shut it. She starts screaming at me that I\u2019m not her mom so don\u2019t try to act like it. That\u2019s when I told her \u201cBaby, it never crossed my mind because I have my own kids to parent. I have no intention of trying to be anything to you, I\u2019m just helping your dad.\u201d \nShe went to the living room and occupied herself with her phone. I made lunch, served it, she didn\u2019t touch it (it was sopita and cheese quesadillas). Her dad picked her up later and when he got back to the hotel he called me about what I said.

It might seem natural for you guys who are adults and normally would be able to help each other out to have you babysit, but I think if you look at it from the daughter's perspective, it's normal she might have a hard time with her dad dating someone and to then ask her to also be ok with that person having authority over her is a bit much for a moody preteen.

If the child was kind of expecting for OP's relationship with her dad to warm up at some point, this is the best time to nip that expectation in the bud.", "I guess he got his answer.", "Yes, that was my thought too", "That means HE overstepped", "No, it\u2019s not,\u2019. If someone is saying \u2018we have no relationship\u2019 and you express that\u2019s you\u2019re cool with that, that\u2019s not rude", "That isn't what she actually said.  She merely replied to Ava's outburst about OP not being her mother that that was unlikely to happen.  If anything, that should reassure Ava, but since the outburst wasn't really about OP being her mother, but about how she didn't have to obey OP.  OP explained that that is irrelevant, given that Ava is staying at her house.", "\nNo it\u2019s not. You are allowed to set boundaries on the kind of or lack of relationship you want with someone. And in the OP she didn\u2019t say \u201cI never want to see or hear from you again\u201d which *would* be over the line to say to a child, she just said \u201cI\u2019m not going to be your mother\u201d to a child who had\u2026.just accused her of trying to be her mother.", ">he was unable to leave her home as his mom had a slip and fall \n\nThat's HIS mom, the girl's grandmother. Her mom is not mentioned. (Also makes sense she can't watch the kid because older woman = probably osteoporosis, could break a hip, etc)", "She doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s why this arrangement works for us both. It\u2019s normal for kids to be possessive over their parents and ava is truly a daddy\u2019s girl through and through.", "Yes, but correcting it is the issue.  Of course some people think that the way OP went about it was wrong, but I don't see a problem.", "Because her injured and heavily medicated grandmother isn't up to it, and needs to rest.\n\n> His daughter \u201cAva\u201d is 12 and he was unable to leave her home as his mom had a slip and fall and wasn\u2019t comfortable watching Ava while she was on heavy medication, she just wants to rest", "If I was the mom and I was taking (presumably) narcotics or something that could be mind altering, I would want someone to watch my kid.", "Yeah that's the knee jerk reaction and it's completely wrong.  You need to get the information and line of communication open before they begin to get the same from their peers.  That means 12 is almost too late, because someone in their peer group has an older sibling who's doing it, and a friend's older sibling is a way worse place to hear this bit of information than your own parent.\n\nAgain, I'm not blaming you for having this reacction. it's natural.  It's just also destructive.    By 12 years old it's time to stop coddling and sheltering and start seriously preparing the child to be an adult.  In fact I'd go a bit further and say that by age 12, you may well be on your LAST chance to get out in front of your child's growth before other less wholesome influences come in greater and greater strength,\n\nAt that age you have maybe 18-24 months to get ahead of this stuff before their peers are going to be bigger influences than you are.  The time goes by shockingly quickly at that age if you aren't being careful about it.", "> A kid doesn\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re not my mom/dad\u201d to a regular babysitter.\n\nYes, they do.", ">She knows.\n\nShe's also 12, which means she knows not to be disrespectful for no reason. I know she's in a weird situation, no one will deny that. I sympathize with the kid more than anyone because my dad put me around weird women starting at age 10. I get that she's pissed and confused. That does not excuse her bullying some kid she doesn't know, being rude and disrespectful for no reason and attempting to further bully the kid after OP separated them.\n\nPeople REALLY need to stop acting like 10-13 year olds are clueless kids with no sense of respect. And if the kids are clueless, it's the parent's fault, and OP did both of them a favor by giving her a reality check.", "Once again, kids do this all the time to babysitters to try and push back.  Its a smart ass thing a kid says when the babysitter tells them to do something like go to bed. Clearly you\u2019ve never or rarely babysat.\n\n\nSounds like their arrangements been working just fine if not for his smart ass bully of a daughter. Clearly the original arrangement they thoroughly discussed with not having their kids involved was working for the best. Its funny how you\u2019re siding with the literal bully thats treating the family who was doing a kind gesture of babysitting her like trash while also claiming the bully and her are the ones with \u201cfeelings.\u201d", "Yikes. That definitely wasn\u2019t my intention, and I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re pulling all of that from what I typed. But I can\u2019t argue your perspective because it\u2019s yours. We all have our own.", "\n\u201cIt never crossed my mind\u2026I have no intention of  trying to be anything to you.\u201d Thats called a statement of rest assured. In this context its in response to a 12 who told OP that she is not her mom. Many a child would take issue that a woman their dads dating might be trying to replace their bio-mom. Alive or dead. Rest assured, OP is not trying to do that. \n\nIn no way does OP say that she is \u201cliterally only interacting with you as a favor.\u201d She says she is \u201cjust helping out her dad.\u201d Which is to imply further reassurance that she isn\u2019t trying to be a mom to this kid.  Great job trying to continue to skew OPs phrasing to back your flimsy stance though. It doesn\u2019t come off as ridiculous what so ever. \ud83d\udc4c", "In your opinion. We do a lot more than fuck each other. If he wants a gf that wants something different, he can. We\u2019ve discussed it. I would never hold him back if he changed his mind and decided he wanted to try marriage again. He doesn\u2019t want a typical relationship because they\u2019ve all failed though. Idk why I\u2019m being painted as some kidnapper that\u2019s forcing some man to stay with me. We\u2019re both financially independent and are with each other by choice, not necessity.", "Oh completely. That's not on OP at all.", "She told a child \u201cYou mean nothing to me\u201d in order to hurt her feelings. She literally bullied a child back.\n\nShe didn\u2019t say yep they have no relationship. She said I *never* want *anything* to do with you.", "sorry, my bad.", "Perhaps Grandma has witnessed Ava\u2019s willful ways and didn\u2019t want to deal with her bratty behavior.", "Thing is he really only had two options:  (1).  Let her stay with injured grandma and help her out or (2). Let her stay in the hotel room alone.  He crossed his girlfriend\u2019s boundaries by asking her to babysit.  Just like someone else mentioned, I was babysitting at her age and staying at home alone.  But I could cook and take care of myself and I\u2019m guessing this kid can\u2019t.", "I think you are misunderstanding what I mean.  I\u2019m 45 and still have zero interest in knowing who my father is sleeping with or the details of the relationship (parents are divorced).  But I have definitely had many conversations about sex, consent, and appropriate interactions with my own kids over the years.  \n\nExpecting a 12 yr old to understand the nuances of an adult sexual relationship like this specific situation is wild.  She\u2019s a kid - quite likely still in elementary school.  She has no idea how she fits into this potential relationship and she\u2019s trying to figure it out because none of the supposed adults have talked to her about it.  The OP seems to think it\u2019s entirely a FWB thing but clearly it\u2019s not like that from the child\u2019s perspective - possibly based on what her father has said to her.\n\nAlso, you said you would agree if she was 2 yrs younger - but not now because she is 3-4 yrs from being propositioned by a horny teen boy?  So the 2 yrs from 10-12 is a big difference but the 3-4 yrs from 12-16 isn\u2019t gonna be a huge change for her or her interactions?\n\nI have a newly 13 yr old daughter and they still chill on opposite sides of the gym at a school dance.  Definitely a different level of interaction vs the kids a few years older at the same school.", "People here like to project or stir up drama for no good reason. Reading into things that aren't there and placing huge bias on word choice (oh if I used that word I would mean XYZ and clearly only I'm correct and they must be doing the same thing! GASP)\n\nThey can't understand tone/nuance and think they are there and know the situation better than you, it's not worth engaging with these folks they're lost causes.", "\"I have no intention of trying to be anything to you\" sounds a lot like \"you mean nothing to me\" tbh.\nThis sounds like you don't even care about her general well being. Should have just stopped at \"I have my own kids to parent\"", "> Idk why I\u2019m being painted as some kidnapper that\u2019s forcing some man to stay with me.\n\nYikes! When did this happen?", "That could very well be the case - she didn't think that having Ava around would be restful.", "I think the issue is that she isn't at home.  Op mentioned in one of her comments that he was afraid that she might open the door to a stranger - even if he told her not too, she might be fooled if someone claimed to be a hotel employee who needed to get into the room to clean it or something.\n\nAdded: He seemed to think that his mother needed more rest than she was likely to get if his daughter was there.", "By they , you must include her boyfriend and most likely her boyfriends daughter ,right? \n\nBecause they agree with us and they are the people who she needs to apologize to if things were taken in the wrong way.", "How? I'm genuinely confused because I just took it as she doesn't intent to be a part of her life like to tell the child there's nothing to worry about. Where did you get you mean nothing to me from? I'm genuinely confused at how one relates to the other like what am I missing? I see others also feel the way you do but I just wonder why?", "Several comments keep saying \u201clet him go\u201d. This isn\u2019t a hostage situation lol", "I could but I don't necessarily have to, I'm directly referencing this conversation chain which is not something her boyfriend/his daughter have stated or claimed.\n\nYou don't know that they agree with these  (yours if you share them) unhinged claims.\n\nShe doesn't need to apologise for others taking it the wrong way and we also don't know what way it has been taken, don't assume.\n\nWe don't even know what the child said or how she feels about it and frankly nothing op said was bad ro her.\n\nBefore you go on, note that my message is to people here saying that op only said this with the intention to make the kid feel small so she could get a handle of the conversation, i have no reason to believe that the boyfriend believes that nonsense.\n\nThere's even people saying you should never tell a 12 year old that you don't want to be their mother, like that is pure nonsense.\n\nPeople here are projecting tone as if she's yelled and sworn at the kid rather than a direct response.", "[deleted]", " No one has to do anything. \nIf I said something to anyone that was taken the wrong way, I would apologize.
