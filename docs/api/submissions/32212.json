She didn\u2019t want to abide by my house rules because \u201cI\u2019m not her mom and never will be\u201d and I told her \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be your mom. I have my own kids.\u201d \n**writing on mobile**\n\nContext: \nI\u2019ve (34F) have been in a casual long distance relationship for 2 years with \u201cMatt\u201d (40M). I set boundaries at the start of our relationship. We will never live together, he will not be involved with my kids or family, I won\u2019t be involved in his. My kids have a dad that\u2019s very active in their lives and we coparent amazingly. The relationship I have with Matt is just that, with *him*.  Matt agreed to these terms. Everything has been great. We never argue because we have nothing to argue about. We have our separate lives and when we\u2019re together it\u2019s like a break from the real world. \n\nMatt is relocating closer to me because he\u2019s grown tired of the city and wants to live in a more rural place like I currently live in. He will still be roughly over an hour away so it\u2019s within comfort. His daughter \u201cAva\u201d is 12 and he was unable to leave her home as his mom had a slip and fall and wasn\u2019t comfortable watching Ava while she was on heavy medication, she just wants to rest. He wasn\u2019t comfortable leaving her at the hotel alone so he asked me to watch her. I agreed and we both understood it\u2019s a one time thing. \n\nHe tells Ava I\u2019m an old friend but I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s heard my name before (it\u2019s not a traditional American name) because of what follows.\n\n She was being hateful to my daughter \u201cRose\u201d (11), making fun of the blemishes my daughter has on her chin. I asked Ava if she wanted to go to the basement to play any of the games down there, she said no so I told Rose to go to the basement. She did.\n\nI then catch Ava slowly opening the basement door and I ask her to go to the living room. She refuses and opens the basement door all the way. I tell her she is not allowed down there right now but she\u2019s welcomed to the Wii in the living room or she can pick a movie to stream. We go back and forth, then I walk to the basement door and shut it. She starts screaming at me that I\u2019m not her mom so don\u2019t try to act like it. That\u2019s when I told her \u201cBaby, it never crossed my mind because I have my own kids to parent. I have no intention of trying to be anything to you, I\u2019m just helping your dad.\u201d \nShe went to the living room and occupied herself with her phone. I made lunch, served it, she didn\u2019t touch it (it was sopita and cheese quesadillas). Her dad picked her up later and when he got back to the hotel he called me about what I said. He said he understands why I said what I said and it is true, but it was out of pocket to say it TO her.\n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1701561357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189gl9c/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriends_kid_i_dont_intend/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s not a very healthy environment to live in.", "YTA\n\nYou don't want to be her mom, fair, but you do have to adult with her and it doesn't sound like you did based on the way you explain things here.  Yes, kid was pushing you, she's 12. You're 34. She was acting her age and...you didn't exactly rise to the occasion. Also, its hard for me anyway not to see this as projecting frustration with Mark that you're being asked to watch her.\n\nIf he's moving closer to you, you might not have to parent this kid, but you have to have some manner of working relationship with her.  The idea that you won't be involved with his family at all just isn't realistic IMO, as this situation shows clearly.", "Nope, you\u2019re NTA.  The girl was trying to abuse your daughter, so you set boundaries.  She played the baby whining game when you enforced it and called her bluff.", "She\u2019s 12 and worried you\u2019re going to be her stepmom if she made that statement. Add to that you have a daughter her age who would be her stepsister. Of course she\u2019s going to say that and act out! \n\nThat\u2019s great you have a relationship that works for you and Matt, but why are you not recognizing she would assume that you two will be marrying someday? You realize she already has picked up on two having a relationship. \n\nYou were kind to watch her but boy this relationship with him is going to be one heckuva confusing thing for the two tweens. Seems like neither of you are actually understanding that. \n\nYTA but not deliberately one.", "NTA it's not like you said anything wrong. You literally agreed with her. She sounds like a spoiled brat.", "Gonna go with NTA. Your bf should have told her the lay of the land beforehand. I don't think it would be a good idea to do this again. Puberty + new partner of parent is a bomb waiting to go off, and you're justified in not wanting to deal with that.", "NTA. I feel like that\u2019s something any babysitter would say if babysitting children in their own home. Whenever a parent drops a kid off at someone\u2019s house, I feel like the send off is \u201cokay, be good and listen to So-and-So, it\u2019s their house and they\u2019re in charge.\u201d At least that\u2019s the send off I always got lol.", "NTA, she doesn't know how to behave in someone else's home and was using the \"you're not my mom\" as an excuse for her crappy behavior. She needed to be set straight.", "Nta you were just straightforward", "NTA it your house your rules. Even if you just her father friend who help with babysitting she shouldn't be rude to you in your own house. She 12 when she still children she can't keep act like toddlers.", "ESH, a 12yo said a childish thing and received a childish response. Reality is different homes have different rules, period.", "YTA\n\nYou should not have said that to her. I get it\u2014when a kid is being disrespectful, it\u2019s really hard not to be disrespectful back, and every parent/adult slips up and says things out of their amygdala at least occasionally.\n\nBut it\u2019s a 12-year-old. Who\u2019s being babysat by her dad\u2019s fuck buddy who admittedly wants nothing to do with her. I can understand why she\u2019d be on edge\u2014a lot of kids would have acted out in this situation.\n\nAs the adult, your job is to know how to enforce boundaries gently and without getting into a power struggle with a child.", "NTA, you said what you needed to Ava when she was behaving badly.", "ESH.\n\nI'm going to agree with your partner- I understand why you said that given the context of your relationship, but that WAS out of pocket. A 12y/o is not going to understand your relationship her dad in the way you do, and while that's not yout fault, your response to his daughter is unhelpful at the very minimum. I think it actually undermines viewing you as an authority figure (because parent or not she should be listening to you, the responsible adult), and only sets her up for more confusion and feeling unloved down the road (should your relationship become more casual, or should your relationship break off and someone enter the picture with Matt who actually wants to be a family unit). She likely went on her phone and didn't touch her lunch because she was upset and was disengaging from her feelings, not because she was truly listening to you.\n\nAre you wrong for thinking / feeling the way you do? No. Are kids assholes and say / do asshole things? Yes. But we have got to treat them better than they treat us.", "Very soft YTA - simply because it's good to have tact with kids. She was being a puke, obviously, but it's also clear she's going through some stuff (the idea of moving from her home in the city to a rural area, for a start, probably has her freaking out). 12yo kids can indeed control themselves, but they still feel pretty big feels. It sounds like she needs a lot more parenting than she's getting.\n\nPreferable words would've been something like \"I'm not your mom, but your dad asked me to be in charge of you until he picks you up.\"", "Yta he\u2019s right, your comment to a 12 year old was inappropriate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
