We both have stable decent jobs, and we are both outgoing people with a variety of hobbies\n\nNow, the issue is that my girlfriend seems to hate one of my hobbies, relaxing and distressing from life by playing video games, with a deep seated vitriol. She also seems to resent that I don\u2019t spend enough time cleaning the house and taking care of chores.\n\nI\u2018lol be the first to admit that sometimes, I forget to put the dishwasher, or mow the lawn, but like I cook everyday, I take care of any internet or tech problems that arise, and I help my girlfriend carry heavy things for her many numerous energy consuming hobbies.\n\nWehenver she tells me I missed a chore, I always say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot\u201d and then help her out. I feel like the issue is closed and the problem is solved. But she always stretches it, always bringing down the mood whenever we are at friends, or gossiping about my so called laziness with her girlfriends. It frustrates me and makes me look bad in front of company, and when I patiently try to explain this, I am always met with hostility.\n\nI reached my breaking point on Thursday, when, during a gaming session with my friends, she starts yelling at me about me leaving my clothes on the bathroom. I tried to mute but it was too late and she really did a number on my reputation. My friends laughed and clowned at me and it didn\u2019t feel good, and when I gently tried to suggest to my wife that public humiliation isn\u2019t effective, she laughed at me instead.\n\nSo to show her how it felt, for the next 3 days, I would incessantly call her \u201clazy phobic\u201d. Whenever she would ask me to do something, I would cleverly respond that she was lazy phobic, and she is misinformed about a marginal community, the community of lazy husbands and boyfriends, and that this community had enough of her micro aggressions. She eventually gave up, but now I\u2019m starting to think I went to far with the joke and I dont need to stoop to her level to get my point accross, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1673217203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106wjau/aita_for_accusing_my_wife_of_being_lazyphobic/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Pull your weight and she won't lose her shit.", "YTA\n\nYou're a grown man who isn't pulling his weight around the house. Period. You joke about \"forgetting\", but living with someone like this is incredibly frustrating and not fair to the other person.\n\nLook, I'm a gamer and game A LOT. But the house comes first, same as the kids and husband. I don't neglect everything around me because I'm too busy gaming, which is exactly what you're doing.", "YTA. You can\u2019t be 29 because you sound like a child. When a partner comes to you with an issue it\u2019s because they care about the relationship and want it to work. Instead you dismissed it and just consistently \u201cforgot\u201d to do things you agreed to do. She\u2019s not your mum. It\u2019s not her job to remind you.

I feel like the issue is closed and the problem is solved.\n\nThis is a huge problem that you're not acknowledging. Basically you're requiring your gf to do all of the emotional labor of maintaining and supervising the chore list. And meanwhile, like a child, you refuse to actually own your own chores and stay on top of them. You *force* her to stay on top of them because you don't take ownership of your own adult responsibilities.\n\nIn many relationships, this is a relationship-ending choice. Read \"My wife left me because I left my dishes by the sink\" or the emotional labor comic. \n\nYou're actively trying to humiliate your gf because you feel wronged, when in fact you are the one in the wrong here.

Doing chores is not \"helping your wife\", it's taking care of your home and family. Keeping up with the household chores is your job too, not just your wife's, and the fact that she continually has to remind you of such simple things as not leaving your clothes on the bathroom floor because otherwise you think it's not a big deal is not a good look on you, really. She also didn't set out for \"public humiliation\", she just got fed up and frustrated with your continual inability to pick up after yourself and yelled at you when you were playing with your friends. Continually forgetting to do the basic things followed by \"oops sorry\" doesn't solve the problem, it IS the problem that she has to keep chasing after you to get you to do your part around the house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know what becomes of lazy husbands and boyfriends who can't be bothered to pick up after themselves and do basic household chores without being reminded, and who then get rude to their partners about it? they become single. Of course she gave up asking you to do basic chores when you kept calling yourself a \"lazy husband\" and calling \"lazy husbands\" a marginal community.

She also seems to resent that I don\u2019t spend enough time cleaning the house and taking care of chores.\n\nI\u2018lol be the first to admit that sometimes, I forget to put the dishwasher, or mow the lawn, but like I cook everyday, I take care of any internet or tech problems that arise, and I help my girlfriend carry heavy things for her many numerous energy consuming hobbies.\n\nWehenver she tells me I missed a chore, I always say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot\u201d and then help her out. I feel like the issue is closed and the problem is solved. But she always stretches it, always bringing down the mood whenever we are at friends, or gossiping about my so called laziness with her girlfriends. It frustrates me and makes me look bad in front of company, and when I patiently try to explain this, I am always met with hostility.\n\nI reached my breaking point on Thursday, when, during a gaming session with my friends, she starts yelling at me about me leaving my clothes on the bathroom. I tried to mute but it was too late and she really did a number on my reputation. My friends laughed and clowned at me and it didn\u2019t feel good, and when I gently tried to suggest to my wife that public humiliation isn\u2019t effective, she laughed at me instead.\n\nSo to show her how it felt, for the next 3 days, I would incessantly call her \u201clazy phobic\u201d. Whenever she would ask me to do something, I would cleverly respond that she was lazy phobic, and she is misinformed about a marginal community, the community of lazy husbands and boyfriends, and that this community had enough of her micro aggressions. She eventually gave up, but now I\u2019m starting to think I went to far with the joke and I dont need to stoop to her level to get my point accross, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you want her to stop \"bugging \", why you never stopped giving her a reason to? How difficult is it to do your chores and then play your games. It's like you are doing it on purpose.

Just because you forgot about them doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re hers to do and yours to help with. \n\nNot to mention the chores you say you do and don\u2019t do. You take care of tech? Cool, how often does that happen? You cook? Probably when you\u2019re hungry, right? And the ones you forget are the ones without immediate gratification. (Edit: spelling)", "I had to read this a few times to make sure this wasn\u2019t my husband.

You cook and occasionally help her carry something. Do you want a cookie for that?", "YTA for doing it on purpose. \n\nAre you neurospicy in some way? Is she a neurotyipcal person? Was there expectation of \"normal\" household thingies? (My house has all spicy people, so our house functions differently.)  Did you forreal forget to do stuff? Do you need body doubling or something? If you have adhd or something, address that. Don't purposefully be an AH. Cause, being an AH on purpose makes you an AH.", "YTA. And let me tell you, I'm the queen of lazy. If I can get away with lounging on the couch all day and not doing a single constructive thing, I'm happy. But I'm not the only one in my relationship. We try to evenly balance dishwashing and do our laundry. I pick up the slack when the weather warms up because he's mowing the lawn and I'm not, so I do more of the indoor chores. And yeah, occasionally he gets frustrated and has to bring up that I didn't do a chore I would said. And you know what? He's right. It's my fault; not his. Grow up.", "If she\u2019s constantly having to remind you to do chores, that becomes another chore for her in and of itself.

YOU ARE BY CONSTANTLY PULLING THIS BS\n\nif you feel ashamed and embarrassed by something you do, here's a grand idea, don't do it anymore. \n\nTake responsibility for yourself and write a chore chart and have everything checked off before you start participating in your hobbies\n\nIf you don't fix this you're going to be single soon", "Your girlfriend is your partner, not your mom.

Stop being such a man-boy and making your gf be your mother.", "Yta - you are lazy. She shouldn\u2019t have to remind you, you should always put work before play. Get the work done right and right away, then your time is your own to \u201cplay\u201d as you please. That way, the chores don\u2019t pile up and turn into big deals. Start doing the chores regularly, in a timely fashion. See how you life improves.", "YTA she is doing all the emotional labor to make sure the household is maintained. She made you look bad by telling people what you were doing? That means you made yourself look bad. She probably wouldn\u2019t have an issue with you playing your game if you actually pulled your weight and did your share of the housework without being told. So you don\u2019t want her to point out that you forgot to do house chores you are responsible for? You wanted her not to point them out? So did you just want them not to get done or for her to give up and do them herself?", "YTA. This isn't a hatred of video games by your gf, this is you using weaponized incompetence against her. At the very least you're forcing her to carry the entire mental load (which is incredibly unfair). Make yourself a list, keep it in your phone, and check that you've done everything you need to before you sit down to game. \n\nIn addition, apologizing and then \"helping her\" does not fix the issue and reveals another one. Why are you \"helping her\" with what was supposed to be your chore? Why does she now need to do even more extra work? You are in a partnership so you have a responsibility to more than yourself now. Do right by your wife and do your chores. Be an equal partner or soon you won't have a partner.", "YTA, not only was your joke not funny but the fact that you have to be told to pick up after yourself making your wife feel like your parent instead of a partner is more disturbing than you think. Time for you to take a step back and reevaluate how much you honestly do as a partner and how much you leave for your wife to do.", "YTA. Dude do your part. You shouldn\u2019t be playing video games till all the work that needs to be done is done.", "YTA and I seriously hope there\u2019s an update where you refer to her as your ex.

Didn\u2019t you ever get taught that you don\u2019t do the things you WANT to do (ie - play video games), until you do the things you NEED to do (like pick up after yourself)?  I mean come on, we all learned this growing up, didn\u2019t we?  You want to play games with your friends - fine.  Get your stuff done first.  Maybe ask her if she needs anything else before you settle in to play?  Everyone here is right pointing out that you do things when you\u2019re asked - why does she have to ask? Why can\u2019t you be mature enough to do the right things before the fun things??", "YTA, jesus how pathetic.  What's even sadder is you think you're \"stooping to her level\" lmao", "YTA, she wants you to do the chores without being reminded, you know this. Stop skewing the facts and help out around the fucking house more.", "YTA - there isn\u2019t much that\u2019s more unattractive than a man sitting around playing video games and cleaning up after him.

That is not what a partner does. \nSometimes it\u2019s easier to be single because what is it that you are contributing???

Die on this hill, but YTA", "YTA. Not only for co-opting language used around genuine causes into this weird perversion, but because you don\u2019t help around the house!!! You\u2019re a grown adult! She\u2019s not your mother!", "\u201cCleverly\u201d doesn\u2019t mean what you apparently think it does. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Mistakes are not repeated, at least not often enough for this to be such an issue. A mistake would be putting the nice steak knife in the dishwasher and then getting minorly chewed out and not doing it again. \u201cForgetting\u201d clothes on the floor, dishes undone, or mowing the lawn are not mistakes. It\u2019s clear that it\u2019s repeated, habitual \u201cforgetfulness\u201d so it\u2019s not forgetfulness, it\u2019s the norm for you. If she chews you out often enough that your friends have heard and often enough that her friends regularly make fun of you for it, it\u2019s not a once in a while thing.\n\nIf my boyfriend leaves his belt on the floor one day, I grab it and put it in the drawer. I don\u2019t tell my family and friends about it. If he left his belt on the floor every day, despite me picking it up and putting it away every day, and then telling him to pick it up, and the reminding him to pick it up again and again and again and again, YEAH, that\u2019s when it becomes petty gossip with my friends and sister. That\u2019s a learned behavior, dude.\n\nYour girlfriend is really, really tired of picking up your clothes, doing your dishes, reminding you to mow the lawn, and any other regular and normal tasks that you are just not doing to help out. She\u2019s at her wit\u2019s end and has realized your reputation is more important to you than her patience and sanity, and is using that. Is it the best way to go about it? No, I think discussion and actual change is best, but you aren\u2019t changing so now the big guns come out. Pick up after yourself and stop pretending it\u2019s normal for your girlfriend to act like your mommy.\n\nFYI, relaxing isn\u2019t a hobby. It\u2019s relaxing. Stop pretending it is.", "YTA Stop waiting for your gf to tell you what needs to be done. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between Passive Help and Active Help. Passive is helping, only after being told to do so. Active is looking for things that need to get done, and then doing them.\n\nMaybe you feel like you\u2019re helping, but it is EXHAUSTING feeling like you constantly have to chide and remind your partner just to do basic household duties", "when he listed helping her carry items like it was some herculean feat, I about died. yta, and I hope she moves to someone who see household chores as a we thing. not a she thing.", "Your contribution to your own household is cooking, occasional tech fixes and \"carrying heavy things\"?\n\nYou are the AH, and she deserves an actual partner rather than a slobby housemate.", "YTA.

You failed at doing basic household tasks, putting her in the position of having to either do them all herself, or have to remind you **repeatedly** to clean up your own shit. \n\nThen you have the gall to be offended or annoyed when other people find out that you're a lazy asshole who can't even throw your own dirty laundry in the hamper instead of leaving it laying all over the bathroom floor. \n\nAnd on top of that shit salad, you made an incredibly unclever joke repeatedly, rather than doing the adult thing and saying, \"Hey, I'm sorry I've been slacking off so much. I'm going to do better. And if I fail to do something, call me out on it and I'll do it immediately.\"\n\nYeah, YTA. She's not your mom. She's not your bang-maid.

You are acting like doing a housework chore is helping her, which means you view those tasks as being in her domain.  You both have a responsibility to maintain a level of cleanliness in the house and from what you have described you are hardly doing your fair share.
