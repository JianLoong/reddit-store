Always been a love hate relationship. Almost barely brothers, but I'd kill for him. My whole family is very self absorbed, so R's actions are honestly nothing new, it's more like I'm fed up with how my immediate family treats myself, & my family I've made. Here's the story. \nIn January of 2022 R called to say he & his fiance (we'll call her L) so R&L had finally set a date for their wedding, & called everyone to announce it. The date they picked, my son's 5th birthday. My wife & I immediately expressed our concerns that the wedding was on our son's birthday, to which we were met with how it'll be cool to share a birthday with them,ect. We should have said no then, but we didn't. My wife & I ended up in the wedding. We agreed to go & set up plans for everything. \nHere is were we get AITA? \nAbout 7 months ago, my wife & I stopped drinking heavily, &.have made a complete 360\u00b0 life change. Our lives have changed for the better, we have started to set healthy boundaries with both families & have basically had 0 contact with R&L, or any of my immediate family. Tonight, 1 month before the wedding L messaged all the bridesmaids about the deposit for hair and makeup. \nI sat down with my wife & totaled up what we still needed to buy for R&Ls wedding. The cost is about $900 not adding in the few things my wife has already purchased throughout the time we have known. We have 5 children, 2 of them have birthdays within 5 days of the wedding, one on the day of the wedding, my own anniversary is 3 days before R&Ls wedding, plus a holiday. \nI called my brother to talk to him & express again how I was feeling & that I didn't think I could afford 2 birthdays, an anniversary, a holiday, & his wedding. I explained it all to him, laid it out.He said nothing but, okay. I ended up calling back & saying that we'd still be attending their wedding just without the kids, even though that meant I wouldn't spend the day with my son on his birthday. He said \"okay bro, as long as your there.\" \nThat stung, I can't lie but I swallowed my pride & agreed then hung up. \nI guess R hadn't talked with L yet, or L didn't care? \nBut, after all the conversations were had, & my wife had announced to the bridal party group chat that she wouldn't need the hair & makeup anymore nor would we need the houses we were all splitting because we couldn't stay overnight & the kids were not attending, but that we'd still be there. L texted in the group \"So are you not paying your part anymore either for something that you said you wanted done &I already signed the contract for\" \nTo which made me upset, I told my wife to just say \"you're right, I'm sorry, I'll send you the money on Friday but I'll no longer be attending the wedding.\" \nAITAH for not attending?", "created_utc": 1696392107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zd5ml/aita_for_not_attending_my_brothers_wedding_on_my/", "score": 290, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You complain that your family is self-absorbed, but from what it wrote it seems that you are being the self-centered one. You complained that your brother\u2019s wedding fell on one of your five children\u2019s birthdays - but there are only so many days in the year. Kids are flexible - you can choose another day to celebrate.\n\nThey told you the date for the wedding over 1 1/2 years ago. You wait until 1 month before the wedding to back out, after all the plans have been made. It\u2019s not even clear why you\u2019re backing out.", ">1 month before the wedding\n\nYTA. You and your wife agreed to be in the wedding party. Dropping out a month before the wedding for no good reason is the behaviour of assholes. More so when it means other people have to absorb the financial loss.\n\nYou knew **18 months ago** what all the calendar conflicts were, and you've also had all that time to budget. So neither of those issues are legit reasons to cancel. The fact that you've given up drinking should have even freed up extra cash.\n\nThis will be the last nail in the coffin of your relationship with your brother, and maybe with other people in your family too.  --->Sounds like that was your intention though.", "YTA. It seems reasonable that you could have had the child\u2019s birthday the weekend prior.", "YTA you are pulling out of your own brother\u2019s wedding one month before without any reasonable excuse. I can imagine few things more hurtful to your sibling relationship. First, I don\u2019t think it should really be an issue that the wedding was on your kid\u2019s birthday. What cooler way for a five year old to spend their birthday than with all their family, eating cake and dancing? It\u2019s tough to find dates for weddings. This wasn\u2019t a slight to your family. Second, your poor planning isn\u2019t your brother\u2019s fault. It\u2019s your brother\u2019s wedding!!! It\u2019s a once in a lifetime day and he needs your support. Skip your holiday if you need to! Third, you chose to get offended at totally normal communication\u2014 probably out of a desire to assuage your own guilt at what is clearly an AH move. If I were your brother, I don\u2019t know if I could ever bring myself to speak to you again.", "YTA you knew the date 18 months prior, if the date was an issue you shouldn't have accepted to be in the wedding at that time. If money is the reason you are not going, you once again should not have accepted the roles of bridesmaid and groomsmen. Your wife should have said no to hair and makeup originally if she didn't want to spend the money. If you weren't planning on spending the night, you should have stated that you didn't need a house when it originally came up. By you two not deciding what you actually wanted you are costing others money. And as far as your son's birthday, celebrate it another day. When I was younger my dad was almost always gone on my birthday (he is a deer hunter and my birthday was often during opening weekend). And I almost always celebrated it another day. I actually didn't mind because it was like I would get 2 birthdays instead of one! It's all about how you approach that situation.", "YTA. Should have planned the birthdays/anniversary before hand and explained to kids that this wedding is a ONE time sacrifice. They have plenty more birthdays and your anniversaries to come. This wedding just happened to fall around that time THIS time around. You also had lots of time to plan this, and you committed to being involved in the beginning.", "YTA. You promised to be there and pulled out at the last minute. You should have just been firm in the beginning.", "YTA.\n\nYou have known for 18 months that this wedding was coming and should have considered the cost of it and the timing of it and made appropriate plans\u2026or just said no. Pulling out a month before is beyond shitty.", "YTA, in 17 months you didn't budget any of this? You didn't look at anything but now a month before you say something. Gross", "Feels like you're just upset that your brother accepted your change in plans (despite it being last minute and affecting them financially) instead of letting you off the hook completely or changing his wedding plans to suit your needs.  So you took offense over the bride's reasonable question just to have an excuse to back out.  You had months to tell them you didn't want to go but you waited to do it until it  would cause issues.  YTA", "Honestly, yes, YTA. It's your brother and you are going to skip on his wedding because he expects you to follow through on a financial commitment you made and can still  afford to honor but tried to back out of too late? Yeah, that kind of sucks.\n\nI understand that you don't have the best relationship but clearly, you were still intending to go. Dropping out of the wedding party might have made sense and it sounds like they were understanding and just happy you'd be there. But to skip the wedding entirely? \n\n> My whole family is very self absorbed, so R's actions are honestly nothing new,\n\nI'm not even sure what massively self-absorbed actions you think you described in your OP. I wonder what's on the list of perceived slights and if you're sure you're not the one who is self-absorbed.", " This is confusing but seems to be YTA\n\nYou went NC with your family for 7 months before the wedding and you waited until a month before the wedding -- until they contacted YOU - to tell them of your change in plans, including pulling out of the house rental, etc.- \n\nYour late excuse included birthdays, etc that you were well aware of when you agreed the first time.\n\nYou're angry they chose a wedding day that was your child's birthday. That seems a bit much. A wedding day choice usually must include a LOT of considerations.\n\nYou're taking offense at their lack of thoughtfulness, but you aren't being thoughtful yourself.", "YTA \n\nYou had so long to back out and you chose a month prior to the event? That's an AH move. All of the things complicating the plans are dates that you have known for years. They cannot be used as an excuse in the way you want.", "R&L announced their wedding date >18 months in advance, the dates of your kids' birthdays and your anniversary are also fixed dates you are aware of well in advance. You could've kindly told R&L you couldn't attend at least a year ahead of the wedding, or plan alternative dates to celebrate your birthdays/anniversary.\n\nYTA for your lack of planning, YTA for letting your lack of planning affect R&L's wedding planning, but most YTA for trying to blame YOUR incompetency on R&L and refusing to take accountability.", ">We should have said no then, but we didn't.\n\n>We have 5 children, 2 of them have birthdays within 5 days of the wedding, one on the day of the wedding, my own anniversary is 3 days before R&Ls wedding, plus a holiday.\n\nYou had over a year to say no and waited until 1 month before the wedding.\n\nYeah, YTA.", "Wait... your brother scheduled a wedding within days of your anniversary AND on your kids' birthday?   \n\n\nESH\n\nYou had a long time to decide. And only did it after they pointed out that you were dropping the ball on something they'd already paid for. \n\nAlso a lot of people can't afford a vacation when a family wedding comes up. Your brother is only getting married once.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEY are being UNREASONABLE TOO! It's pretty easy to tell hair and makeup you have one less person (I worked in weddings), and get the bill adjusted. They often charge by the person because of the time it takes. Maybe they can't with their artist, but they didn't even try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso your brother had to pick a date within days of your anniversary. Yikes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Those things you imagine damaging a siblings relationship, is Exactly why our relationship is the way it is. We have an older brother who abused us both, who will also be a part of this wedding. There were also things added to the bridal party demand after we agreed, such as also setting up decorations and cooking for all 100 guests, including ourselves. We expressed our concerns and were told just do not help. We originally didn't know we would need to stay overnight even though it's 3 hours away. The men were all in one house, women in another. This is when my concerns started & all the moral conflicts started & then the NC started. Also, the wedding date was pulled from a hat, they joked about it when we expressed our concerns. I feel like I just no longer love my brother.", "I accept that ITA, I should have just cut them out 18 months ago instead of trying to be a part of my family & the wedding.

Yes, a 360 turn right back where I was, but not an alcoholic. We were already being left out of the plans. Finding out afterwards or even just by mistake. We're a prop for their wedding. I hope they enjoy the $383 in Japan. \n\nWe were left out of a \"family BBQ\" 2 months ago, and found out by our mother calling and asking what we were bringing, called back 20 minutes later said NVM and acted like they never had one.

You know weddings are expensive. You knew your children's birth dates and that shouldn't come as a shock to you. It's not R&L's fault that you keep agreeing to stuff and then saying they don't care? Your fickle behavior & indecisiveness is not their fault and now you're paying all this money yet not attending the wedding? How could you think you're not the AH?", "YTA. Since when is a birthday or being within days of an anniversary a date you can\u2019t choose for your own wedding?

Heck, I rarely heard from my aunts and uncles on my birthday, no card, no present, no phone call.  And it didn't phase me, nor did I ever question that they didn't care about me.  It was just understood that while they loved me, I wasn't their priority because they had their own lives, own children, own problems, etc. (which is perfectly acceptable).  \n\nIt's hard to keep up with everything and everyone.  Hence why rarer events like weddings are given priority.  It represents the rare chance people can make and find the time to catch up.\n\nEverything you have complained about, every imagined slight you have listed are inherently selfish and unreasonable.
