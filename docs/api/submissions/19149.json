The classic example is a pool.  \n\nI am not a lawyer and do not know what else comes into play, but that's one aspect.", "I have a neighbor a few houses away in a semi-rural area. Newish arrivals. Their place has a pool, and every time I walk down the road I can see it, about 40 meters up their driveway. It's fenced off, but there is NO GATE, just a 2.5 meter wide opening, facing the road.

Almost every post by non-lawyers I've read in this thread provide wrong (and in some cases, seriously wrong) advice.  Want to give legal advice?  Go to law school and get a license to practice law.  A Google search is not a substitute for a legal education.  What happened to your brother-in-law is not a substitute for a legal education.  \n\n\nNext: An attractive nuisance is one which, as the name implies, is one maintained on private property that is likely to attract children.  This can include all sorts of things, such as unfenced swimming pools, construction equipment and large snow mounds.  The owner of the property is liable if someone is injured because of maintenance of an attractive nuisance.  Trespassing signs do not mitigate liability for an attractive nuisance.

When he looks at you funny, tell him you were told by your agent that if you got a pool your premium would go up XXX per year and was curious if the number he gave you included that premium.  \n\nJust fyi, virtually every state/town has laws about pools being fenced and the gate being securable.  Some towns even have more strigent rules that the states they are in.  Insurance companies are even more specific, with premiums going up if the fence isn't high enough or there are trees overhanging the fence, and no locking gate would have them declining the coverage because the pool is not securable."]}
