But as soon david was an adult he had it in his own hands what he wants to do with his life. Instead of finishing school and get a degree he chose to drop out (thats on him), chose to live with some dude he met online (thats on him too) and now has to crawl back to his parents bc against better knowledge, he in fact DID chose short time pleasure over having an degree or working to support his art career. \n\nDavid sounds like the typical lazy young adult who only does what gives him instant satisfaction and when something goes wrong expects everybody else to pick up the slack for him. Seen this enough with young adults who drop out of school and expect to live at their parents and get supported while gaming all day or doing another hobby. And a lot of parents let them.

Your son sounds very much like my youngest (F20)--my oldest was the super strong student/high achiever/heading to grad school. Younger one barely got through HS, despite being at a private one where she had a dedicating learning coach. She is also very creative and was into art and theater, and is LGBTQ. She's ADD and very disorganized and messy, despite growing up in a pristine home (I'm a neat freak). Anyway, she went to college which I thought was probably a mistake, but we agreed to let her try. Stopped going to class two weeks in. It was paid for so we let her stay, but then she came home. The deal was that she work full time and pay rent, or go to school. For the first year, she worked at a salon, to see if being a hair stylist was something she'd want to do. It was, so the second year home, she went to school full time and also continued to work part time. I did not have her pay rent during this as it was part of our deal. We did not instill a curfew--she's an adult--and no set chores, but she is expected to clean up after herself in shared spaces and help out with things when asked. She's now about to  graduate from school and start working f/t as a stylist, where she'll make plenty of money. She's hoping to move out by next summer. It's been VERY hard for me, being very Type A/overachieving but she is just wired completely differently and has  found a way to be a productive adult who can support herself. The worst part of her being home is that her room and car are complete disasters to the point where it's just unsanitary, and her hygeine leaves a lot to be desired, but she pulls it together at work and is professional when it comes to that. So again, I do not think YTA--if an adult (child or not) wants to live in your home, YOU get to make the rules and THEY can decide if they want to live with those or not. Making these stipulations on our daughter was one of the best things we could have done for her.

Most kids would also love to stay in college if they felt it was useful and they were doing well; David likely made a mature and difficult decision to drop out after 2 years if he didn't believe the school was contributing to his goals or that he was showing up in the right way for the experience.\n\nSecondly it's no wonder he has had trouble setting long term goals for himself; you have a narrow idea of what success is and he hasn't been able to see a future for himself within that tiny sphere because he likely hasn't been exposed to much. And although you supported his interest in art, you did so \"begrudgingly\", in a way that he was probably constantly fighting with himself in his head to see the activity as worthy or see a way he could use the skills to make a living or be content with his life. He probably still deals with deeply conflicted feelings about whether what he actually wants to do in life is possible or whether he is a lazy kid who likes to doodle and has no other prospects because of his own life failures. Maybe he thinks he needs to follow his passion in art OR do something high earning, and doesn't realize he can strike a balance or engage in work that meets totally different emotional and intellectual needs that he has but hasn't been able to articulate because HS is a weird and contrived environment that a lot of people don't get or don't thrive in. \n\nRather than telling him there is something wrong with him, help him discover what he needs. It's possible he's neurodivergent in some way (depression, anxiety, adhd), but it's also possible he just isn't familiar with careers or life paths that match his interests and skillsets (and so he hasn't had much direction). I'd gently ask if he'd like to be tested for any mental health or learning disabilities, but say you understand it could also be the case that he has no issues there and it is just a matter of you all as a family not being exposed to different ideas of success and different types of careers. He already thinks you believe there is something wrong with him, so despite mental health being an important thing to check in about, I wouldn't use it to absolve yourselves of responsibility for correcting some past mistakes you made with parenting regarding his skillsets and interests. Find out about different career options and paths to them other than FANG and med school, find out about internship or work experience opportunities for young adults (many programs exist to get people under 25 experience in and exposure to different careers), help your kid get hooked up with career counseling and also learn ways you as a non-career coaching expert can still help him identify some goals and help him chart paths to those options through self research. \n\nWith an interest in art he could maybe go into architecture (a heavily competitive field but, if he doesn't hack it designing buildings or landscapes, is good preparation for construction management or development or even city planning and consulting type positions as well). Graphic design or marketing. UX design. Or maybe he's passionate about art but doesn't want to inject that into his 40 hr workweek, and would rather go into a career that allows him to stay active or help people (firefighter, police officer, coast guard, nurse, health care tech) or allows him to work and create with his hands (carpentry, electrician, other trades).  Maybe he wants to go into social work or education (public school art teacher, art therapist, non art related teaching, social work, program coordination?). Maybe white collar work that allows him to support the arts or art orgs without the pressure to create (hr, accounting, donor relations and event planning) appeals? No profession is \"stupid\" or \"unworthy\" or \"unsuited\" to him. He's only 20. Have a positive mindset. \n\nThere is so much out there that I wasn't aware of when I was 18-22. If I felt like my parents supported me and were there to help me, and they actually put effort into learning about paths I could take alongside me rather than threw me out to the wind like \"well your plans are stupid and there's 5000 things wrong with everything you want to do and 5000 reasons why you won't succeed, and the only help we can provide is push 1 to 2 specific careers down your throat that youve repeatedly expressed no to little interest in?

You can instead approach it as a collective effort. \"Well, now that you want to be roommates with us we've got to come to some shared agreement about quiet hours and dividing the chores in the house like you would in any other living situation.

He needs to be working. That's a basic thing. If he's not bringing in any income, then at minimum, he should be in school. \n\nEven if you didn't charge him rent, I can imagine the idea of your adult child, with no job or prospects moving back home to be......not great. How long would he stick around and delay his adult life and development?\n\nBut, at the same time, he's only 20. He made a dumb choice to follow a romantic partner and got screwed over.

How old was he when he told you?\n\nHow often have you and your wife reached out to him over the past few years? Checked in with him to see how he was doing? Invited him and his boyfriend over?\n\nThe lazy person in this scenario is you!

They could have taken a different approach to encouraging him in school, they could have helped him find art-centered career paths, and they could have broadened their definition of \"success\" beyond \"getting a STEM career\". It's pretty clear even from OP's telling that he knew he wasn't supported by his parents and couldn't tell them stuff that was going on in his life. Also OP is a a-hole for not expressing sympathy for his son who just got cheated on and went through his first major breakup. \n\nThat said, doing chores and adhering to a curfew in exchange for free room and board while he gets back on his feet is a pretty sweet deal. Realistically he does need to get a job or career training (school, apprenticeship, etc) to be a financially independent adult and get his own place, so again I don't think that's an onerous requirement. Given that he approached OP, it doesn't sound like he thought he'd be unbearable miserable living under his parents' roof-- he only called it a \"prison\" once OP laid down rules.

They fall back on other methods because in some ways the community support angle can become contrived when they own the house, when they're in a position of earned and practiced authority as parents, when children who are hitting siblings are literal 3 yr olds that don't have developed brains, etc. But \"this is a community that we all can contribute to and gain benefit and meaning from, so let's have a discussion about what we all think a great living situation looks like and what consequences there would be if either of us doesn't uphold the roommate agreement\" is worth a try with a 20 yr old who has had some experiences living with roommates already and might be more familiar with that lingo. \n\nCertainly parents may have to fall back on more unequal power dynamics in some situations (we own this house and aren't moving, you're in a position of limited housing choice and means so you can't vote with your feet either, and we're particular people that need silence at 9pm to get up for our demanding jobs that pay the mortgage and it's non negotiable, sorry). But it's worth acknowledging what's occurring is that your needs are incongruous with David's, not that he is being punished because he's a delinquent gay artist up to no good at 1am (as curfew and no sympathy implies). There may very well be compromises and ways David can provide his input about what oil a well functioning house needs to turn, and that's a more healthy living situation for adults living together.", "Actually, that's how we teach kids how to follow rules in pre-k!

It's to say that you can't control those people so you have to grow in yourself and overcome to succeed because the alternative is sitting down and crying in front of the obstacles instead of climbing over them, or finding a way around them.\n\nIf you say \"That was the reason I gave up, which is why I'm where I am now.\" you are correct.

OP can't supply genuine appreciation for art (because that's not in their make up apparently), they can only supply the means for the son to pursue it, and they did.

To me a curfew means \u201cyou must be home by X time\u201d, not \u201cthe door locks at X time and unlocks at Y, but you don\u2019t have to be home by X - you just won\u2019t get in until Y.\u201d One allows a lot more freedom than the other.", "I'm literally living with someone who works nights and I'm up all day.\n\nI don't need a curfew or a bedtime.", "I think it's a bit different though if it's your parents, and they are giddy about your siblings' accomplishments and activities and then are barely tolerable of yours.", "every child is not the same and is not guaranteed to respond to the same parenting styles. this is just like.... obvious and basic knowledge. maybe OP should have tried getting to know and understand their child for the individual he is. this is where its OPs fault. he did what he always did and it didnt work so *CLEARLY* the kid must just be a failure. /s\n\nthis post REEKS of \"missing missing reasons\". i couldnt imagine not even checking in with a parent after they paid for my school... someone fucked up somewhere. i also couldnt imagine my daughter coming home after the end of a relationship and me being like \"its clearly your fault that youre so childish and selfish, youre a failure, you can move in /i guess/ but expect to be treated like a child again.\" jesus christ. OP clearly doesnt like david at all and only feels a purely obligatory responsibility for davids survival.", "I'm not wasting my money on a degree with no ROI. I absolutely do look down on these degrees that are a waste of money and time so you end up supporting your kid through school and adulthood because they can't support themselves. Absolutely ridiculous. Student loan subreddit is full of these kids who regret these decisions but it's too late. Now they have the loans that are never going away and shit job prospects \"because they now do what they love\" and can't get ahead cause they make $400/month", "And some people can't handle school. \n\nThe demands do sound fair.

That wasn't the situation I had to deal with.", "The poster your responding to said the person they gave a curfew works the same shifts. Curfew for you wouldn\u2019t work because you have to make noise when they sleep and same in reverse right?", "He did though. It says in the post that they encouraged him to pursue art, even put him in art school, and he left due to laziness. I don\u2019t get the urge people have to defend mediocrity and claim it\u2019s other people\u2019s fault when in reality it\u2019s typically someone failing to put in effort. \n\nAlso, let\u2019s clarify some things from your second paragraph: \n\n1) the end of the relationship isn\u2019t the issue, it\u2019s the \u201cI\u2019m broke, jobless, homeless, and I need to move back in\u201d that\u2019s squarely the child\u2019s fault and a direct result of his choices. \n\n2) if someone asked you to move in, pay for all their shit, and then got mad when you said that you\u2019d let them if they did things like getting a job, going to school, helping out around the house, and being home at a reasonable hour, you\u2019d recant and let them move in? \n\n3) make no mistake, 20 year olds who don\u2019t have their shit together SHOULD be treated like children.
