David dropped out of artschool by his own (a school he wanted to do given his interest in art and as far i understand his parents paid for). And also somehow david has not enough savings to support himself (so obviously also didn't worked or didn't worked enough when dropping out of school). \n\nYes, maybe OP could have done stuff different. But as soon david was an adult he had it in his own hands what he wants to do with his life. Instead of finishing school and get a degree he chose to drop out (thats on him), chose to live with some dude he met online (thats on him too) and now has to crawl back to his parents bc against better knowledge, he in fact DID chose short time pleasure over having an degree or working to support his art career. \n\nDavid sounds like the typical lazy young adult who only does what gives him instant satisfaction and when something goes wrong expects everybody else to pick up the slack for him. Seen this enough with young adults who drop out of school and expect to live at their parents and get supported while gaming all day or doing another hobby. And a lot of parents let them. So in a few decades we will have a bunch of unemployed adults, too lazy to support themselfs, expecting others to pay for them while never created any value for the society they live in (and want to mooch of).", "It sounds like you don\u2019t think he should have any household rules at all? The rules are \n- work or study\n- do household chores like everybody else\n- don\u2019t come home in the middle of the night\n\nPersonally I would hate being woken up at every hour when I have to work. All of this is totally reasonable, but it sounds like you don\u2019t think there are any boundaries parents can put on adult children.", "Don\u2019t want to be treated like a child?

School or work and being a contributing member of the family as a condition for living at home is reasonable and healthy.", "I agree. I had more artistic inclinations growing up. But was strongly encouraged into more 'sensible' pursuits. Although his parents don't entirely understand him, they certainly tried to encourage him in his area of interest.", "People don\u2019t believe in personal responsibility or accountability anymore.", "Apparently it isn\u2019t in this case\u2026as he is moving back in with his parents with no job.", "Lol ok I guess it basically means that. \n\nIt means in spite of the father not approving.", "You haven't really caught my drift.

I still don\u2019t really understand what you mean that people learn responsibility by seeing love of community but i lol at the idea of you trying to stop a child from hitting a sibling by yelling \u2018what about love of community???\u2019 \n\nI guess if David comes home at 2am every morning his parents can just tell him they don\u2019t love the community he\u2019s providing.", "Rules are fine with me too. You boil it down perfectly by referring to the power struggle. But the unwarranted force has always been OP trying to redirect his son. Most parents associate too closely, unreflectingly, with Authority as an identity. Especially cos they learnt it from *their* parents. OP introduced this exertion of force and it kinda means he's always gonna have to spend that energy on subjugating his son if his son doesn't come around. There were other approaches. Is there still room for another tack? Who is gonna open up breathing room?\n\nAcceptance was missing in David's childhood by the sound of it. Probably for all three kids. This is poor soil. It'll become apparent later with the other two.", "Oh sorry I think your typo left us thinking you didn\u2019t know what chagrin is.", ">I absolutely did not catch your drift based on what you wrote.\n\nThis was abundantly clear.\n\nI think you're probably taking words out of OP's mouth here, it musta been while you were kissing he\n\nProblem with kids hitting kids is adult society models those values everywhere anyway. Parents need to get at the root issue with their kids not leave a note saying \"don't punch it's bad\" on the fridge.\n\nI gather I've presented what is for you a new outlook.

Judging from your other responses you don't even see your own knee-jerk dismissiveness -- on show here as you're all snark in this comment -- which is bigly sad. You and OP should defo console each other over a beer.\n\nEdit - A reply-and-block, thank fuck! I wonder what substance they thought they were bringing", "That was a Meat Loaf reference chill out", "I see you didn\u2019t respond to the actual substance. \ud83d\udc4d", "Your comments reek of \"dropped out of art school to move in with a guy you just met\""]}
