{"id": 33237, "submission_id": "18ku7g8", "title": "AITA for calling my boyfriend \u201cmi amor\u201d when I\u2019m white?", "selftext": "My boyfriend (18M) and I (18F) have been dating for a year and a half, and it\u2019s been absolutely wonderful. It\u2019s both of our first relationships, so we\u2019re extremely lucky to have such a caring first relationship. However, there\u2019s been a little thing recently I would love some more insight on.\n\nI\u2019m white (Ginger, Irish-Catholic type of white) and my boyfriend is 1/4 Mexican from his grandpa on his dad\u2019s side. A couple months into our relationship, he told me that he always heard his grandpa calling his grandma \u201cmi amor por siempre\u201d (my love of forever) or simply \u201cmi amor\u201d (my love). He expressed to me that he always found it very romantic and that he would love to call each other it. I also thought it was very sweet, so it\u2019s been a nickname we\u2019ve been calling each other for the last year or so.\n\nA few days ago, I was showing a friend of mine a meme he had texted me, and she saw what I have him saved as in my phone. It\u2019s \u201c[his name] <3 mi amor\u201d. She got very upset at me and told me that I was appropriating Mexican culture. She told me that only he has the right to call me that since he\u2019s part Mexican, but since I\u2019m white, I should refrain from it. I told her that it was Spanish, not exactly Mexican culture.\n\nShe said she wouldn\u2019t talk to me until I apologized and changed the name in my phone. My boyfriend is very stressed at the moment, and I don\u2019t want to burden him with a weird drama like this, so I thought I would come here. AITA?\n\nAdditional Edit: (at roughly 1,750 upvotes?)\n\nHi everybody! First of all, I am absolutely blown away at how quickly this has gotten out of my hands haha. I was expecting maybe 20 people max to read this, I don\u2019t really know how to react. This is my first time going viral (Is this considered viral?) and I am generally not the best with social media, so I\u2019ll try to add a few things that might clarify/add? Not super sure if this will be helpful:\n\nFirstly, I guess I should\u2019ve explicitly said this, but the friend is white. I have really only started to get to know her the past few months as she is in the grade below me (I\u2019m a senior)\n\nSecondly, I\u2019ve seen a lot of comments saying that this is extremely obvious and I\u2019d like to apologize on that. I\u2019ve grown up in an extremely rural town (I can count my graduating class on my fingers) and minus a school provided computer with most websites blocked, I never had real \u201cunlimited\u201d access to the Internet until I bought my own smartphone last year. I\u2019ve been trying my best to educate myself on issues like appropriation since they are never really commonly taught where I grow up. I\u2019ve grown a lot, but sometimes things like these I just need a little extra input on.\n\nThirdly, I\u2019ve seen a lot of comments about jealousy. I heard at one point she did have a crush on my boyfriend, but that was before we started dating and she never made a move on him, so I never really took that into consideration. However, looking back on some past interactions especially recently, something like that makes a lot of sense.\n\nShe has me blocked on so I\u2019m going to reach out to a few girls that know her and see how serious she is about this issue. If she\u2019s unwillingly to drop it, I\u2019ll likely follow the advice and drop her. I don\u2019t really know how updates work (Separate post? Keep editing this one?) but I seriously appreciate all the help everyone!", "created_utc": 1702855085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ku7g8/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriend_mi_amor_when_im/", "score": 2260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s both of our first relationships, so we\u2019re extremely lucky to have such a caring first relationship. However, there\u2019s been a little thing recently I would love some more insight on.\n\nI\u2019m white (Ginger, Irish-Catholic type of white) and my boyfriend is 1/4 Mexican from his grandpa on his dad\u2019s side. A couple months into our relationship, he told me that he always heard his grandpa calling his grandma \u201cmi amor por siempre\u201d (my love of forever) or simply \u201cmi amor\u201d (my love). He expressed to me that he always found it very romantic and that he would love to call each other it. I also thought it was very sweet, so it\u2019s been a nickname we\u2019ve been calling each other for the last year or so.\n\nA few days ago, I was showing a friend of mine a meme he had texted me, and she saw what I have him saved as in my phone. It\u2019s \u201c[his name] <3 mi amor\u201d. She got very upset at me and told me that I was appropriating Mexican culture. She told me that only he has the right to call me that since he\u2019s part Mexican, but since I\u2019m white, I should refrain from it. I told her that it was Spanish, not exactly Mexican culture.\n\nShe said she wouldn\u2019t talk to me until I apologized and changed the name in my phone. My boyfriend is very stressed at the moment, and I don\u2019t want to burden him with a weird drama like this, so I thought I would come here. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m white as hell", "NTA. He invited you in, and that trumps her sanctimonious judgmental bullshit.

Plenty of people who speak Spanish are not Mexican. My father was from South America (and wasn't white) and spoke Spanish. My mom is white and I am closer to her in skin tone.

Those of us who are actually Hispanic don\u2019t care if white people speak Spanish", "Maybe. I'm sure one could write an essay on the subject of cultural appropriation, or cross cultural perception of privilege in language, or something suitably academic-sounding. I won't. But as the person I replied to has some German in their post history, I'm going to assume they're from a well off European country and they've learnt a pretty standardised British English. This is not something that England has tried to protect, but to actively force on as many other cultures as possible, so I'm going to declare it Fair Game.\n\nWould it be cultural appropriation to speak, say, Black English, or Indian English (or any number of similar dialects)? That's harder and depends on circumstance. If a person grew up speaking textbook English, but deliberately adopted a dialect that was considered inferior or less educated, or routinely subjected to racism, then yes that would be cultural appropriation (I'm not going to form an opinion on of its ok for an actor to put on such an accent, for example, or if Hollywood ought to hire an actor with the appropriate accent natively).\n\nIf one learnt English as a second language in a marginalised community, or from a teacher who came from a marginalised community? I honestly still think that's not cultural appropriation. Partly because you are interacting with the community to learn it, I would argue this is a healthy cross-cultural exchange in a healthy multicultural society, and the community, or at least the individual, is ok with it. Consent counts for something. But also because sharing languages is a vital first step for sharing and understanding cultures. How can you have multiculturalism if you can't learn the languages of minority cultures? I don't believe that the healthy way to integrate migrants is to force them to speak English and never learn anything about them. So, nothing to do with my \"English is fair game\" argument. I think language learning has to be exempt from cultural appropriation pile-ons, whether or not you agree with the cultural appropriation concept. Language is so vital for un-marginalising marginalised groups.\n\nBut I didn't intend to actually get into the meat of this post, just to rag on the British. Since I'm here now, I think the post's premise is ridiculous, and it would be disrespectful to refuse to learn about your partners culture while dating them. Sharing language, learning recipes, etc.", "In general I agree with you. But there's a difference between widely used languages and almost-destroyed languages. If languages are still at an early stage of being revived, it's fair for resources to be focused first on native speakers and the cultural in-groups.\n\nAn example from where I live: it's becoming more common for government departments to take part in training to learn the Ngunnawal language. And while that's great, and will hopefully assist in strengthening  & spreading use of Language, we don't want to create a situation where corporate trends take over and Ngunnawal people can't afford to learn their own words.\n\nThere's also cultural nuance around written vs oral cultures. In oral cultures, your native language can be part of a [taonga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taonga): It's precious to your culture, and it's used to pass down cultural knowledge too sacred to put in writing.\n\nColonialists knew this, and used it as a weapon to crush oral cultures all over the world. If you want to control a populace and stop them from practising their traditions, it's EXTREMELY easy to do that to oral cultures. Banning the use of native languages means that you also cut off historical knowledge and the ability to pass down culture. It very quickly severs the generations from being able to communicate with each other.
