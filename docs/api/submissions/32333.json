Im getting married in a week and  originally Ron wasn't coming but all of a sudden yesterday Matteo ask if Ron can come.

Matteo got mad and yelled at me that our other siblings got to bring a date and I countered that they already said they were going in the beginning and I actually wanted them there. Matteo gets even more mad and tells me Ron told him this would happen and that the only reason I wouldn't let him bring Ron is because hes a boy. I told him that wasn't true and I explained why I didn't want Ron there.\n\nHe just blows up at me crying that none of its true and asking me why i couldn't just be happy for him and called me homophobic.

You need to tred carefully here because Ron may well turn your brother against you. NTA", "NTA, but neither is your brother. Honestly sounds like he's being emotionally abused by Ron, who's trying to drive a wedge between Matteo and his family.\n\nIf it were me, I'd talk to Matteo again, he obviously has a lot of respoect for you if you're who he came out to first. Take him out for the day, be a big brother, and just let him know that you're trying to look out for him.. He might not accept it, but when shit hits the fan with Ron, and it sounds like it will, Matteo will need his brother.", "NTA. Ron will start a scene at the wedding. But dont be surprised if he ties up Matteo\u2019s whole day and night with abusive text messages and has him crying in the bathroom, meeting him outside and begging if he can come in because they\u2019ve made up. Ive dated a Ron and if there is one thing narcissistic ppl like to do it is ruin a holiday or special occasion, since its not all about them. Maybe you could ask a relative or friend to be on \u201cRon Watch\u201d", "NTA - you have a valid reason for not wanting Ron there.

And man, it seems Ron is REALLY good at ~~grooming~~, I mean, coaching your brother about what you'll say and how to reply.\n\nEdit: Flipped Ron and Matteo.  My mistake.", "NTA and Ron sounds abusive and controlling", "\u201cRon told me this would happen\u201d \n\nIt is clear as day that this Ron is turning him against you.", "NTA\n\nSit your brother down with your parents, and explain that you are extremely concerned about whats going on. Your brother is a minor and it is up to his parents to protect him, and they need to be made aware of what's going on. Explain to them how controlling Ron's behaviour is. Lay it out calmly and matter of fact: the constant monitoring of his location, verbally abusing him and then using gifts to excuse what he's done, isolating him from his friends and now, his family.\n\nIt is extremely common for abusers to prime their victims to react to reasonable responses with these kind of overly emotional reactions, but that doesn't make Matteo's behaviour acceptable. Just because he is being abused does not make it ok to behave abusively to other people.\n\nState that he knows you are not homophobic, and that weaponising homophobia to bully you into doing what Ron wants is disgraceful behaviour. Reiterate that Ron is NOT invited to the wedding because of his behaviour, and it has nothing to do with his gender.\n\nYour brother won't like this conversation, but that's just too bad. Abusers thrive in silence. Your parents need to be AWARE of what's going on. Your brother needs to be informed of the different types of abuse so that he can recognise what Ron is doing. Talk about it, and don't let Matteo shut the conversation down.", "Maybe tell your brother, \"the way Ron treats you and talks you isn't ok. If you were straight and a girl, more people would be concerned about your relationship, especially because Ron is 2 years older than you. But because there's less awareness about what unhealthy LGBTQ relationships look like, it's gone unnoticed. I am not being homophobic I am treating you the same as I would a straight couple. You missed the deadline. It would cost --- extra to add a guest at this stage, and I don't want to pay to add someone who I don't think treats my baby brother the way he deserves to be treated. When you're 17 you may feel differently about dating someone who is 15.\" \n\nNTA", "NAH but Ron.\n\nMuch more important is for you to remember that Ron wants you and your brother to fight. It will reinforce what he\u2019s telling him behind closed doors: that he\u2019s the only one bro can trust, only he knows what\u2019s best for him, only he truly loves him, everyone else is homophobic, disloyal, want to hurt him, just don\u2019t care, whatever fits in the moment.\n\nAbusers are absolutely masterful manipulators and Ron seems to have a really good head start cutting bro off entirely from his support network - his ultimate goal.\n\nA tad off the deep end here I know but these guys start young and it\u2019s absolutely intentional so whatever happens always keep talking to bro and stay pals!", "NTA your wedding your rules but be careful, it sounds like Ron may be a controlling abuser. He is already isolating Matteo and that Ron said to Matteo you would do this concerns me. Just make sure this doesn\u2019t cause Matteo to isolate himself from family as well. Edit word", "NTA - 15 YO don't get a plus one.", "~~Sit the kid down. Look him in the eyes. Make him realize that even after you explained, he called you homophobic and a liar, and refused to consider anything you said the truth. First of all, why would he treat family like that? Second of all, if he really does believe you're that terrible... why does coming to the wedding matter? Tell him to go back to his boyfriend and skip the wedding if they're both going to be that toxic about it. Words have consequences, and you can't just abuse family and not expect something to happen. It might not seem like a big deal now, but later down the line he'll realize he missed his big brother's wedding over a stupid boy. That kind of regret won't go away.~~\n\nEdit: Leaving up the original comment for posteriority. Don't uninvite your brother, he'll just see it as a confirmation that Ron was right. Let him come if he wants to, but reiterate that Ron CANNOT come. If he chooses not to go, then that's on him. You just need to wash your hands of this situation and not deal with it for a while. The consequence in this situation would just be less contact with Matteo. I wouldn't do NO contact though, just make it clear that you're mad at him and what he said was wrong. Then, when his relationship inevitably explodes (because we know it will), you have to be there for this kid to have a soft landing and a shoulder to turn to. \n\nSit him down. Explain clearly that what he said was wrong. Explain that you love him. But be firm and repeat that Ron cannot come. Matteo can come, but alone. It has to be his decision. That's all, wash your hands of this mess until after the wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou handled this all wrong. You should never have said you didn\u2019t like him. The only reason should have been lack of space. You basically played right into Ron\u2019s hands.", "You aren\u2019t not obligated to invited your brother\u2019s emotionally abusive high school boyfriend to your wedding. But he can\u2019t see the forest for the trees right now. Keep being there for him, especially when the relationship inevitably crumbles. \n\nNTA.", "Oh, for heaven's sake. The BF is an A H and has been saying shit into the brother's ear. The brother is young, naive, and cares far more for this loser than he deserves, but you can't tell him that as he (the brother) is a teenager and hasn't yet realised he doesn't know shit about life. \n\nMy advice is: 1. Cool off. 2. Sit your brother down and explain that you love him, support him, and want to be there for him... but... supporting him doesn't mean having to like every bf he chooses. You don't care he has a bf. You just don't like who he chose. 3. Explain that your feelings about his bf are not the issue here. It is your wedding, and you get to choose who you do/don't get to share it with. Also, explain that a wedding is NOT the time to bury the hatchet whatever issues you and he have, and if the bf really wants to do that, you would be happy to make time SEPARATE to the wedding to meet him and talk to him... but he still won't be at the wedding. Finally, point out that you asked if he (the brother) wanted a +1. He declined. The deadline is past, and even if you wanted to, you don't have the space or the budget to make last-minute changes. Deadlines are part of life. He needs to understand that he missed this one. \n\nBeing gay doesn't mean your brother gets to be an A H to you, but I don't think that is the problem. The bf sounds toxic, and your brother is insecure and desperately trying to make this relationship work and his bf to continue liking him. I bet anything that the bf doesn't want the brother to go alone. He sounds controlling AF. That's why your brother is saying these things. He is repeating the BS being told to him (probably in a way to make the brother look bad if he disagrees or make the family look bad if they do). He's abusive. Don't let the bf isolate your brother. Also, don't let the bf go to your wedding. You don't need that drama.", "You do realize this kid is trying to make your brother turn his back on his family now, right", "NTA but have you talked to your parents about the situation?", "NTA. You\u2019re right to be concerned as his brother .", "NTA\n\nRon set up a situation where he knew you'd \"fail.\" He declined wanting to go only to \"change\" his mind last minute, likely knowing it would be too late. He guised this as a way to \"fix\" your relationship with him. Well, first off, your wedding isn't the time for him to try and fix anything. Even if his reasoning was legit, it's selfish to expect this to happen on a day you are getting married.\n\nI understand that being called a homophobic and unsupportive person is hurtful, but try to keep composure. If what you suspect is true, this reaction only drives your brother to Ron, and Ron is getting the exact outcome he wants. You have to remember, Matteo is being conditioned by Ron to take this abuse. Matteo will defend Ron because he may not even realize just how bad Ron really is.\n\nYou need to sit down with Matteo and have a real heart to heart about the situation. Tell him that while you understand he likes Ron, his personal feelings may be blnding him towards Ron's actions. Tell him that you love him and want him to be happy, but Ron isn't a real source of happiness. You see him hurt, you see him arguing, and that isn't love or a real healthy relationship. \n\nThis is probably his first relationship, right? He can and will find someone better. Don't make accusations. Don't lash out when Matteo will inevitably defend his abuser and call you names. Keep a level head and try to keep the dialog going. You won't fix this problem in one conversation. It will likely take multiple attempts, but keep trying and keep being there for him.\n\nHave a great wedding. Hope you and your brother work through this.", "Might be bf did this to cause a rift it's last minute I would question it", "NTA,ron is doing this on purpose to try and cause drama on one of the biggest day of your life and to sow discord between you and your brother so he is playing the gay card to do so,if not why would he all of a sudden want to \"patch things up\" with you out of no where when he can do so without attending your wedding,do not cave in to your brother's demands and don't invite ron to your wedding because he will absolutely stir some shit on the day of your wedding and you need to get your brother to break up with him.", "NTA but I think this is a pivotal point in your brother\u2019s life. His boyfriend is already isolating him. I think this event will allow him to isolate him even more. If you don\u2019t invite the boyfriend that means a huge family fight and Ron gets to act like the family hate him and are against him. If he is invited I\u2019d bet he does something there to cause a scene and create a family rift that way. \n\nFor example watch the documentary \u201cabused by my girlfriend\u201d. I feel like if I was in your place I would take to some experts on abusive relationships to figure out how to move forward. Personally I would let your brother know that it is too late to add more guests but you would like to  have a chance to restart things with Ron and maybe you could set up a dinner to do that. \n\nGood luck. I know you must be worried about your brother. It\u2019s time to get educated on this.", "NTA but, realistically, I think you need to accept that you\u2019re fighting an uphill battle here and change your approach. It is often hard for prolonged victims of abuse to recognize that they\u2019re being abused and to admit it to themselves. I personally believe it has to do with the way abuse rewires your brain. Objectively, I knew that the way my ex treated me was abhorrent but he convinced me that it was my fault. It took a significant event before it finally clicked that I needed to run. In your brother\u2019s case, his age and the fact that he grew up in a culture/family that values machismo means that he will likely resist the truth because, in his mind, he probably believes that abuse isn\u2019t something that happens to *men*. That said, he\u2019s 15 and presumably understands how deadlines work. I would sit him down and calmly reiterate what you said originally: his boyfriend was originally invited and declined, so his space was given to someone else. There simply isn\u2019t room for him at the event and that has nothing to do with his sexuality or their relationship. If his boyfriend wanted to attend, he should\u2019ve RSVP\u2019d originally. Frankly, I doubt the boyfriend really wants to come but just wants to control your brother and guilt him into not going. If you want to head off the homophobia claims, you could offer to meet them for dinner once the wedding dust has settled.", "Nta your wedding and you brought up good points I\u2019m hoping your brother can see how bad Ron is", "Nta this isn't about liking Ron or not.  There isn't room for another guest. Period.  He didn't get a plus one so you didn't plan for a plus one.", "NTA \n\n1. You don\u2019t have the space \n2. You don\u2019t like Ron\n3. Sounds like Ron set you up - \u201cRon told me you\u2019d say that!\u201d. Ron is turning out to be quite manipulative. Be careful, he can do a lot of damage to your brother.

The first love sets the stage for all other loves..", "NTA.", "NAH\n\nI'm coming from a place of being the oldest sister with a similar age gap. \n\nYour brother is young and in a bad relationship. I would sit him down and tell him the truth again. Let him know how much it means to you that it seems like Matteo hurts him. \n\nTell him love him no matter what, but he can't accuse someone of being homophobic so that he gets what he wants. That wasnt true, it's harmful, it's hurtful and that you hope he can trust you more in the future. \n\nDon't let this guy tear you apart. Make sure he knows you're always a safe place.", "NTA, your brother is. If you don't like Ron, why should he be at your wedding? It's your special day, not his.

You may not condone the relationship, but if the guy really is abusive, the last you want is for Matteo to feel excluded by his family. Ron will use that as a \"us against the world\" weapon, and you risk allienating your brother even more. I know it's a very hard thing to do (been there with a lot of friends) but you have to support your brother, even if you don't agree with his relationship, because you want him to trust you enough to actually talk to you when/if things go sour, if Sam actually is an abuser.", "Absolutely NTA. However, for the sake of your relationship with your brother, make him apologize for the shit he threw you, and consider making a little room for this toxic dude.

Also, it\u2019s rude for a guest to demand a plus one after they RSVP\u2019d solo. *He\u2019s* the one breaking etiquette. Accusing you of being homophobic is an AH move.", "NTA. It's okay to not want people you dislike at your wedding. Plus, he was originally invited but declined, so your guest number for the venue is already set.\n\nHim calling you homophobic was unjust and mean. He owes you an apology, but it might help if you had a serious talk with him. He needs to learn that he can't scream bigotry every time something doesn't go his way. Particularly when you have supported him.", "NTA", "Teenagers don't get plus ones. Really that's all that needed to be said. Also, the guest list was already cemented when Ron changed his mind.\n\nThat said, my advice would be different if your brother were an adult. Sometimes it's easier to just let your sibling bring their shitty boyfriend to keep the peace. But a teenager? Fuck no, tell him teenagers don't get plus ones.", "NTA.

Try to understand that Ron has spent time deliberately keying up his emotions behind the scenes, probably making him defend you and playing you to be the villain because, of course you aren't going to comply with this ludicrous request. Ron doesn't want you to, or else how else would he prove to Matteo that he knows his family better than Matteo thinks he does? It's an obvious plot to turn Matteo against his family, and it will take a lot of careful action to avoid playing in to Ron's game \n\nGood luck, and I hope you and your brother can both get free of Ron asap", "NTA sounds like Ron set this situation up to cause conflict between you and your brother because he knew you wouldn\u2019t want him there", "NTA. As someone who got married to the man I met when I was 14, this is why teenagers shouldn\u2019t date.", "NTA. He\u2019s a kid and you\u2019ve already made seating arrangements.", "NTA, but find room for your brother to bring him.", "NTA - Ron is. I doubt he's interested in going to your wedding, he either doesn't want Matteo there without him and/or he knew this would be a great opportunity to set you up for failure and use it as a way to further isolate and manipulate your brother. I get that you don't want him there, that our first reaction to people we don't like can be to exclude them; which in many cases is the best course of action. But with the partners of the people we love, when we force them to choose we're hurting them, not the people we don't like. This is especially true in situations where toxic partners set up or utilize scenarios to make themselves the victim, the family the villians, and manipulating their partner into choosing them and damaging their relationship with friends and family who mean well\n\nIf you can, it would be worth including him; *for your brother's sake.* I'd sit down with your brother and tell him that while you don't personally like Ron, that there's nothing more important than your relationship as brothers and wanting him to be happy. When people we love have toxic partners, it fucking hurts, but it hurts them more. The best shot we have is ensuring that we do everything we can to strengthen the bonds we have with the people we love so its harder for them to be manipulated into cutting us off, isolating themselves, and becoming more and more easy to control", "NTA. Ron sounds controlling, manipulative and possessive. Your brothers behavior reflects that as well. I really hope you can get through to your brother because he's still young and more naive and he needs to know that this isn't a healthy relationship. He needs support from all of you. Ron sounds like bad news.", "NTA. That\u2019s not a healthy relationship.", "NTA. Well it looks like you're well beyond the point of stopping your little brother from being abused by his boyfriend. So that's its own mess. But I wouldn't want that at my wedding either. Spare yourself the drama.", "NTA. I\u2019m a girl, but I was in the same position at that age, an abusive relationship that isolated me from everyone else. I probably wouldn\u2019t have heard anything against her either. One sign of abuse really stood out to me: every time you go to your partner about something that\u2019s upsetting you, you end up apologizing. Maybe try to gently point out some of those things", "I have a feeling your brother calls everybody homophobic who doesn't give him what he wants. \ud83e\udd23", "Op I don't think you did anything wrong but you need to tread very carefully. If what you say is true your brother is in an abusive relationship. It's hard for people that have never been in one to understand what it's like. It turns your brains into scrambled eggs. It wrecks your self image and confidence. Abusers can be soooooooo persuasive. Abusers oscillate between abuse and love bombing, and it's incredibly effective, especially when the victim doesn't have a support base. You start believing what the abuser says is true, or just shutting down during the hard parts, and hooo boy, what a formidable tonic denial can be.\n\nMake no mistake, this was a deliberate move on Ron's part to begin isolating your brother from his support base. He waited to say he wanted to come until he knew it would cause issues, and then he PRIMED your brother by telling him if you said no, it would be due to homophobia. Not the obvious answer of seating charts and meal plans, nah, it could only be *homophobia*. No doubt, your bother called him upset after your fight, and Ron oh so lovingly consoled him, told him he's so sorry, but he was worried that would happen, it explains the look's you've given Ron, told you your sister didn't like me, nobody understands our love, only Ron is safe, only Ron will be there, only Ron matters...\n\nIt may be time for a frank conversation with your brother. Explain at length how much you love him and accept all of him and will be there to support him no matter what. But you cannot support Ron. Ron is an abuser. Ron is deliberately trying to cause problems, such as waiting until he knows there's no plan for him to insist on coming to the wedding. When he's ready to leave Ron, you will fly to him and help him with whatever he needs, but you cannot enable Ron's abuse. Ron is no longer welcome around you. You have to emphasize that you will be there for Matteo, but you can no longer support an abusive relationship. You've seen how much the relationship has negatively effected him, how he no longer spends time with his friends, the constant fighting, it's toxic, and you love him so much you can't enable it. He deserves so, so, so much better.\n\nThen, the hardest part, be available, whenever possible tell him you love him and he deserves better and when he wants an out you'll help him find it - but step back, and wait.", "NTA.  Family weddings are not the place for your teen squeeze.  Especially as a last minute addition when RSVPs are in and locked.  I would defer this issue to your parents.  I'd encourage throwing up of hands \"too late, RSVPs are set, you'll be busy with photos, etc it wouldn't be that fun for him\"", "No. Not your kid not your problem.", "No 15 year old needs to bring a \u201cdate\u201d to a wedding.

Congratulations on your wedding and focus on other wonderful blessings.", "NTA, but you\u2019re fighting a losing battle, but now that that cats out of the bag, tell your brother that Ron is abusive, and you will support him in his life 100% and that you will ALWAYS have his back but you can\u2019t support him being with an abuser. Become a broken record on this point and tell your parents and family, \u201cI love Matteo and I\u2019m worried Ron is abusing him, please encourage Matteo to see a counselor at school or talk to somebody\u201d. \n\nMatteo & Ron will probably continue on the line of you being homophobic, but just be that broken record \u201cI\u2019m worried because of the way Ron treats him\u201d.", "NTA\n\n\"Sorry Mateo, the food is already ordered and the tables laid out.

Call the cops and have Ron arrested.   Protect your brother even if (especially if) he doesnt want you to.", "NTA. But Ron wants to cause division, so go the opposite. Apologize to Matteo that you absolutely cannot accommodate an additional guest at the wedding, but you are so glad Ron wants a chance to \u201cfix things\u201d and let\u2019s plan a dinner or hang out after all the wedding stuff is over, so you can really get to know each other\u2026", "NTA but I would invite Ron so you don\u2019t isolate your brother. I would also tell your brother no matter what you are there for him and give him pamphlets or websites on signs of an abuser.

It'll take time to overcome this, as teenagers feel everything so deeply for the first time, and lack the experience/tools to deal.\n\nRon's just stirring sh\\*t between you. If he genuinely wanted to fix your poor relationship, it wouldn't be at your wedding, when you're going to be too busy and tired to get much past small-talk with anyone, let alone your teenaged brother's boyfriend of what, less than a year? Even if you could fit Ron in, that's adding unnecessary emotional labour to the day. If Ron genuinely cares to make nice, he'd show more consideration for the timing.\n\nMatteo's relationship is important to him, but it is simply an inappropriate occasion to properly talk with Ron. Your issues with Ron aren't easily handwaved, ignored, or forgotten about. Tell him you're open to fixing the relationship only *after* the wedding, if that is truly what Ron wants.", "NTA, but stop trying to tell your brother how much you don\u2019t like Ron. The wedding is a week away\u2014 you don\u2019t get to RSVP a week before the wedding and expect that the family will bend over backwards to help you. Tell your brother that you do not have room for him, but if he would like, you can all go out to get coffee or lunch one day and talk over things once the wedding and honeymoon are over. \n\nDon\u2019t give him any more room to twist your words. Ron knows it\u2019s an impossible ask, and so does Matteo. Offer the lunch as a peace offering, and let the ball be in Ron\u2019s court.", "A week is short notice to add anyone to most weddings. \n\nTrust your gut about Ron I can see the red flags from all the way over the other side of the internet, but dissing him to Matteo is not the way. 17 and 15 is a pretty big age differential.\n\n\nNTA", "Nta. \nBut this is a sensitive situation and how you approach this going further is going to be important.\n\n I'm going to give you a little bit of  my own experience as I was in matteos shoes. I was him. Not in the sexual orientation terms but this is definitely signs of an abusive relationship this is exactly how mine was. When I was in it I could not tell or see it but my sister could she was the first one to hate my boyfriend we would often argue and fight. Because she continued to handle this aggressively and with force it made things harder and worse. I'd believe my boyfriend more and go to his arms more and trust him more than my own family. My sister resorted to violence tackled me to forcibly take my phone from me she hated him so much. Our rooms were next to each other she could hear everytime I cried she could hear our conversations she knew how bad it was thats why she got that way but when in thay situation and having him in my ear I saw her behavior as evil and toxic and it made me believe him more. It made it harder for me to realize how toxic this was and to leave. Most of it was emotional and mental abuse which is what it seems like it is for your brother right now.  I could be wrong but his boyfriend is definitely controlling and everything you explained is exactly like everything I went through with my sister when I was in my awful situation.  Unfortunately I was never going to see because things had gotten too far. It wasn't until my sister gave up on me my family loosened their reigns and Unfortunately some horrible things happened that opened my eyes. Once I realized and wanted to escape him, my family had my back and helped me get out right away. \n\nWhat I'm saying and even my therapist after the fact acknowledged that trying to force someone to see or get out of this situation a lot of time just pushes them to the toxic person more. Still try to be their support and have calm conversations with them because one day your brother will see how toxic his bf is and he will need all your support. But right now he is taking his anger pain and confusion out on you, I did it with my sister and it almost destroyed us. Our relationship is ten times better now. I don't want my story to scare you at all I hope it helps in some way.\n\nHe needs patience and time and I'm sorry this is going to be hard for all of you. About your wedding though ultimately its your wedding and your decision so that's entirely different you don't have to invite anyone you don't want to regardless of their relationship to your guests.", "NTA. There is no room for the bf.", "NTA sounds like it was set up to drive a wedge between you and your brother so he can isolate your brother.  He sounds like an abuser.  Yes, take it easy how you handle this.   But still it's your wedding you have the right to say who comes and who doesn't.", "NTA - unfortunately not much you can do right now OP. Ron has his grubby little talons in deep on your brother, so I doubt he'll listen to reason right now.\n\n This whole situation screams abusive BF, but again because Ron has his talons in deep, Matteo won't realize until he wakes up and takes off the rose tinted glasses, which really has no timeline.\n\nMy recommendation is to make sure he knows you'll always be there for him and if he ever needs a safe person, you'll be that person. Ron is human and like all humans he'll eventually make a mistake and let the mask fall and hopefully at that point Matteo wakes up and realizes the situation he's in.", "Honestly not judging but if I was in your shoes ( am not ) I would have allowed Ron to come . From the constant calling and making your brother cry , you should have gotten a whiff of the controlling brat . Do not push your brother and Ron out I repeat . For instance your brother would most likely not attend your wedding cause Ron won\u2019t be going . All this leave Ron with more time and freedom to control your brother in bring them all in close and don\u2019t let Ron know your watching him . If it\u2019s not too late tell your brother that you want to apologize to Ron and personally invite him . Don\u2019t give Ron more space to control your brother if possible but enlist  only your mom and dad to keep an eye out . At the end of the day am not you and you have control over your actions but in my judgement possibly luring a potential threat closer and giving the control freak a false sense of control is worth more than a 15 yr old serving .", "You don\u2019t need Ron in your wedding photos. Ron has your brother completely in his control and he\u2019s turning him against everyone. Try and get your parents to break them up. Their must be nicer boys his age he could get with.\n\nStick to your guns.

It sounds like Ron knows this and is using this as a way to drive a wedge between you and Matteo. He knew that you would say no because either you didn\u2019t have space or because you don\u2019t like him and is manipulating your brother into believing it\u2019s because you\u2019re homophobic. \n\nTry to sit down with your brother again and tell him how much you love him and that you support him. Also, maybe try to call Ron\u2019s bluff. Tell Matteo to invite Ron over since Ron wants to \u201cfix\u201d your relationship with him and see what happens. Good chance Ron will not want to come over or actually want to fix things and then it might expose the games he\u2019s playing.", "NTA\n\nAdding another guest last minute may not be feasible.

Isolating Matteo from his friends, turning him against you\u2026all of these are preludes to much more sinister behaviours.\n\nI\u2019m an older brother too, so I understand if your instinct is to tell Ron to go f himself. Unfortunately, that will just \u2018confirm\u2019 to Matteo what Ron\u2019s been saying. As much as it hurts, the best thing you can do is be patient and let Matteo know he can always talk to you if/when things go bad with Ron.

I went through this exact thing. My sister fought me so much to get away from him and all it did was make me trust him more.", "How?", "I'd like to mention that I'm not saying to ignore this situation, as it shouldn't be ignored. You should make your parents also aware of what's going on and try to intervene in calm and helpful manners and try to show you are always by his side and want to help him but he can't attack you like that and thay also something awful is happening here.
