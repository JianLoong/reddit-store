You need to tred carefully here because Ron may well turn your brother against you. NTA", "NTA, but neither is your brother. Honestly sounds like he's being emotionally abused by Ron, who's trying to drive a wedge between Matteo and his family.\n\nIf it were me, I'd talk to Matteo again, he obviously has a lot of respoect for you if you're who he came out to first. Take him out for the day, be a big brother, and just let him know that you're trying to look out for him.. He might not accept it, but when shit hits the fan with Ron, and it sounds like it will, Matteo will need his brother.", "NTA. Ron will start a scene at the wedding. But dont be surprised if he ties up Matteo\u2019s whole day and night with abusive text messages and has him crying in the bathroom, meeting him outside and begging if he can come in because they\u2019ve made up. Ive dated a Ron and if there is one thing narcissistic ppl like to do it is ruin a holiday or special occasion, since its not all about them. Maybe you could ask a relative or friend to be on \u201cRon Watch\u201d", "NTA - you have a valid reason for not wanting Ron there.

And man, it seems Ron is REALLY good at ~~grooming~~, I mean, coaching your brother about what you'll say and how to reply.\n\nEdit: Flipped Ron and Matteo.  My mistake.", "NTA and Ron sounds abusive and controlling", "\u201cRon told me this would happen\u201d \n\nIt is clear as day that this Ron is turning him against you.", "NTA\n\nSit your brother down with your parents, and explain that you are extremely concerned about whats going on. Your brother is a minor and it is up to his parents to protect him, and they need to be made aware of what's going on. Explain to them how controlling Ron's behaviour is. Lay it out calmly and matter of fact: the constant monitoring of his location, verbally abusing him and then using gifts to excuse what he's done, isolating him from his friends and now, his family.\n\nIt is extremely common for abusers to prime their victims to react to reasonable responses with these kind of overly emotional reactions, but that doesn't make Matteo's behaviour acceptable. Just because he is being abused does not make it ok to behave abusively to other people.\n\nState that he knows you are not homophobic, and that weaponising homophobia to bully you into doing what Ron wants is disgraceful behaviour. Reiterate that Ron is NOT invited to the wedding because of his behaviour, and it has nothing to do with his gender.\n\nYour brother won't like this conversation, but that's just too bad. Abusers thrive in silence. Your parents need to be AWARE of what's going on. Your brother needs to be informed of the different types of abuse so that he can recognise what Ron is doing. Talk about it, and don't let Matteo shut the conversation down.", "Maybe tell your brother, \"the way Ron treats you and talks you isn't ok. If you were straight and a girl, more people would be concerned about your relationship, especially because Ron is 2 years older than you. But because there's less awareness about what unhealthy LGBTQ relationships look like, it's gone unnoticed. I am not being homophobic I am treating you the same as I would a straight couple. You missed the deadline. It would cost --- extra to add a guest at this stage, and I don't want to pay to add someone who I don't think treats my baby brother the way he deserves to be treated. When you're 17 you may feel differently about dating someone who is 15.\" \n\nNTA", "NAH but Ron.\n\nMuch more important is for you to remember that Ron wants you and your brother to fight. It will reinforce what he\u2019s telling him behind closed doors: that he\u2019s the only one bro can trust, only he knows what\u2019s best for him, only he truly loves him, everyone else is homophobic, disloyal, want to hurt him, just don\u2019t care, whatever fits in the moment.\n\nAbusers are absolutely masterful manipulators and Ron seems to have a really good head start cutting bro off entirely from his support network - his ultimate goal.\n\nA tad off the deep end here I know but these guys start young and it\u2019s absolutely intentional so whatever happens always keep talking to bro and stay pals!", "NTA your wedding your rules but be careful, it sounds like Ron may be a controlling abuser. He is already isolating Matteo and that Ron said to Matteo you would do this concerns me. Just make sure this doesn\u2019t cause Matteo to isolate himself from family as well. Edit word", "NTA - 15 YO don't get a plus one.", "~~Sit the kid down. Look him in the eyes. Make him realize that even after you explained, he called you homophobic and a liar, and refused to consider anything you said the truth. First of all, why would he treat family like that? Second of all, if he really does believe you're that terrible... why does coming to the wedding matter? Tell him to go back to his boyfriend and skip the wedding if they're both going to be that toxic about it. Words have consequences, and you can't just abuse family and not expect something to happen. It might not seem like a big deal now, but later down the line he'll realize he missed his big brother's wedding over a stupid boy. That kind of regret won't go away.~~\n\nEdit: Leaving up the original comment for posteriority. Don't uninvite your brother, he'll just see it as a confirmation that Ron was right. Let him come if he wants to, but reiterate that Ron CANNOT come. If he chooses not to go, then that's on him. You just need to wash your hands of this situation and not deal with it for a while. The consequence in this situation would just be less contact with Matteo. I wouldn't do NO contact though, just make it clear that you're mad at him and what he said was wrong. Then, when his relationship inevitably explodes (because we know it will), you have to be there for this kid to have a soft landing and a shoulder to turn to. \n\nSit him down. Explain clearly that what he said was wrong. Explain that you love him. But be firm and repeat that Ron cannot come. Matteo can come, but alone. It has to be his decision. That's all, wash your hands of this mess until after the wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou handled this all wrong. You should never have said you didn\u2019t like him. The only reason should have been lack of space. You basically played right into Ron\u2019s hands.", "You aren\u2019t not obligated to invited your brother\u2019s emotionally abusive high school boyfriend to your wedding. But he can\u2019t see the forest for the trees right now. Keep being there for him, especially when the relationship inevitably crumbles. \n\nNTA.", "Oh, for heaven's sake. The BF is an A H and has been saying shit into the brother's ear. The brother is young, naive, and cares far more for this loser than he deserves, but you can't tell him that as he (the brother) is a teenager and hasn't yet realised he doesn't know shit about life. \n\nMy advice is: 1. Cool off. 2. Sit your brother down and explain that you love him, support him, and want to be there for him... but... supporting him doesn't mean having to like every bf he chooses. You don't care he has a bf. You just don't like who he chose. 3. Explain that your feelings about his bf are not the issue here. It is your wedding, and you get to choose who you do/don't get to share it with. Also, explain that a wedding is NOT the time to bury the hatchet whatever issues you and he have, and if the bf really wants to do that, you would be happy to make time SEPARATE to the wedding to meet him and talk to him... but he still won't be at the wedding. Finally, point out that you asked if he (the brother) wanted a +1. He declined. The deadline is past, and even if you wanted to, you don't have the space or the budget to make last-minute changes. Deadlines are part of life. He needs to understand that he missed this one. \n\nBeing gay doesn't mean your brother gets to be an A H to you, but I don't think that is the problem. The bf sounds toxic, and your brother is insecure and desperately trying to make this relationship work and his bf to continue liking him. I bet anything that the bf doesn't want the brother to go alone. He sounds controlling AF. That's why your brother is saying these things. He is repeating the BS being told to him (probably in a way to make the brother look bad if he disagrees or make the family look bad if they do). He's abusive. Don't let the bf isolate your brother. Also, don't let the bf go to your wedding. You don't need that drama.", "You do realize this kid is trying to make your brother turn his back on his family now, right", "NTA but have you talked to your parents about the situation?", "NTA. You\u2019re right to be concerned as his brother .", "NTA\n\nRon set up a situation where he knew you'd \"fail.\" He declined wanting to go only to \"change\" his mind last minute, likely knowing it would be too late. He guised this as a way to \"fix\" your relationship with him. Well, first off, your wedding isn't the time for him to try and fix anything. Even if his reasoning was legit, it's selfish to expect this to happen on a day you are getting married.\n\nI understand that being called a homophobic and unsupportive person is hurtful, but try to keep composure. If what you suspect is true, this reaction only drives your brother to Ron, and Ron is getting the exact outcome he wants. You have to remember, Matteo is being conditioned by Ron to take this abuse. Matteo will defend Ron because he may not even realize just how bad Ron really is.\n\nYou need to sit down with Matteo and have a real heart to heart about the situation. Tell him that while you understand he likes Ron, his personal feelings may be blnding him towards Ron's actions. Tell him that you love him and want him to be happy, but Ron isn't a real source of happiness. You see him hurt, you see him arguing, and that isn't love or a real healthy relationship. \n\nThis is probably his first relationship, right? He can and will find someone better. Don't make accusations. Don't lash out when Matteo will inevitably defend his abuser and call you names. Keep a level head and try to keep the dialog going. You won't fix this problem in one conversation. It will likely take multiple attempts, but keep trying and keep being there for him.\n\nHave a great wedding. Hope you and your brother work through this.", "Might be bf did this to cause a rift it's last minute I would question it", "NTA,ron is doing this on purpose to try and cause drama on one of the biggest day of your life and to sow discord between you and your brother so he is playing the gay card to do so,if not why would he all of a sudden want to \"patch things up\" with you out of no where when he can do so without attending your wedding,do not cave in to your brother's demands and don't invite ron to your wedding because he will absolutely stir some shit on the day of your wedding and you need to get your brother to break up with him.", "NTA but I think this is a pivotal point in your brother\u2019s life. His boyfriend is already isolating him. I think this event will allow him to isolate him even more. If you don\u2019t invite the boyfriend that means a huge family fight and Ron gets to act like the family hate him and are against him. If he is invited I\u2019d bet he does something there to cause a scene and create a family rift that way. \n\nFor example watch the documentary \u201cabused by my girlfriend\u201d. I feel like if I was in your place I would take to some experts on abusive relationships to figure out how to move forward. Personally I would let your brother know that it is too late to add more guests but you would like to  have a chance to restart things with Ron and maybe you could set up a dinner to do that. \n\nGood luck. I know you must be worried about your brother. It\u2019s time to get educated on this.", "NTA but, realistically, I think you need to accept that you\u2019re fighting an uphill battle here and change your approach. It is often hard for prolonged victims of abuse to recognize that they\u2019re being abused and to admit it to themselves. I personally believe it has to do with the way abuse rewires your brain. Objectively, I knew that the way my ex treated me was abhorrent but he convinced me that it was my fault. It took a significant event before it finally clicked that I needed to run. In your brother\u2019s case, his age and the fact that he grew up in a culture/family that values machismo means that he will likely resist the truth because, in his mind, he probably believes that abuse isn\u2019t something that happens to *men*. That said, he\u2019s 15 and presumably understands how deadlines work. I would sit him down and calmly reiterate what you said originally: his boyfriend was originally invited and declined, so his space was given to someone else. There simply isn\u2019t room for him at the event and that has nothing to do with his sexuality or their relationship. If his boyfriend wanted to attend, he should\u2019ve RSVP\u2019d originally. Frankly, I doubt the boyfriend really wants to come but just wants to control your brother and guilt him into not going. If you want to head off the homophobia claims, you could offer to meet them for dinner once the wedding dust has settled.", "Nta your wedding and you brought up good points I\u2019m hoping your brother can see how bad Ron is", "Nta this isn't about liking Ron or not.  There isn't room for another guest. Period.  He didn't get a plus one so you didn't plan for a plus one.", "NTA \n\n1. You don\u2019t have the space \n2. You don\u2019t like Ron\n3. Sounds like Ron set you up - \u201cRon told me you\u2019d say that!\u201d. Ron is turning out to be quite manipulative. Be careful, he can do a lot of damage to your brother.

The first love sets the stage for all other loves..", "NTA.", "NAH\n\nI'm coming from a place of being the oldest sister with a similar age gap. \n\nYour brother is young and in a bad relationship. I would sit him down and tell him the truth again. Let him know how much it means to you that it seems like Matteo hurts him. \n\nTell him love him no matter what, but he can't accuse someone of being homophobic so that he gets what he wants. That wasnt true, it's harmful, it's hurtful and that you hope he can trust you more in the future. \n\nDon't let this guy tear you apart. Make sure he knows you're always a safe place.", "NTA, your brother is. If you don't like Ron, why should he be at your wedding? It's your special day, not his.

You may not condone the relationship, but if the guy really is abusive, the last you want is for Matteo to feel excluded by his family. Ron will use that as a \"us against the world\" weapon, and you risk allienating your brother even more. I know it's a very hard thing to do (been there with a lot of friends) but you have to support your brother, even if you don't agree with his relationship, because you want him to trust you enough to actually talk to you when/if things go sour, if Sam actually is an abuser.", "Absolutely NTA. However, for the sake of your relationship with your brother, make him apologize for the shit he threw you, and consider making a little room for this toxic dude.

Also, it\u2019s rude for a guest to demand a plus one after they RSVP\u2019d solo. *He\u2019s* the one breaking etiquette. Accusing you of being homophobic is an AH move.", "NTA. It's okay to not want people you dislike at your wedding. Plus, he was originally invited but declined, so your guest number for the venue is already set.\n\nHim calling you homophobic was unjust and mean. He owes you an apology, but it might help if you had a serious talk with him. He needs to learn that he can't scream bigotry every time something doesn't go his way. Particularly when you have supported him.", "NTA", "Teenagers don't get plus ones. Really that's all that needed to be said. Also, the guest list was already cemented when Ron changed his mind.\n\nThat said, my advice would be different if your brother were an adult. Sometimes it's easier to just let your sibling bring their shitty boyfriend to keep the peace. But a teenager? Fuck no, tell him teenagers don't get plus ones.", "NTA.

Only that Ron acts different around their parents.", "I mean he made it clear that he wants to go with Ron, who has a clear issue with OP, and called OP a homophobe? Like what? If my family members did that to me and were acting unreasonably then yeah dude, they're not going to my fuckin wedding wtf. I'm not going to give them the chance to be unreasonable at what is supposed to be one of the most important times of my life.", "You can say no to that without all that other ridiculous stuff and uninviting him? Like what?", "I mean I guess you're right that it could be worse to uninvite the kid because then he could see it as confirmation that he and Ron were right. What I would do is let him come, then, but alone. And if he doesn't want to, that's because he chose to.", "Could be seen? In what world is there another possibility? Let him be alone? No his family will be around him.\n\nWhy are you so determined to help with Ron's agenda of isolating him from his family. Seriously, what is wrong with you?", "What. I literally said I was wrong and OP shouldn't univite his brother, but stay firm on Ron not coming. Are you unable to read or something? \"let him come alone\" means come to the wedding without Ron, genius. No shit he's going to be with his family at a wedding involving a family member. What did you even think I meant?", "He would never come alone. He is 15. Genius. Are you unable to read or something?"]}
