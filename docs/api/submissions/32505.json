How is nudity seen where you are in general. \n2. You need to be in balance with those you live around because we need to live together amicably.

Pretty sure it\u2019s illegal here to be naked in your backyard, though I\u2019d hear the police coming up the driveway and the dogs would bark so we\u2019d immediately go inside and it\u2019d be hard to prove I\u2019d think", "We don\u2019t go out of our way to be naked around them, but we also don\u2019t give any messages that naked bodies are in any way shameful. As they get older, we talk more and more about privacy and things of that nature, but they are a very impulsive, sensitive, and anxious child, so we aren\u2019t going to make a big deal out of them seeing us naked. There\u2019s nothing sexual about it. It\u2019s natural and we won\u2019t be making them feel like they\u2019ve done something wrong seeking us out for comfort/company when we are in the shower or changing or whatever. Overtime, we will continue setting gentle boundaries, and they will get to an age as well where they want to set their own boundaries. Nudeness/modesty is just a social/cultural construct anyway.

Sharing every little event in my life, especially the bad ones, with whoever she pleases. She would bring up embarrassing info about me in conversations with random people - my teachers, friends, their parents, the house help, driver, work colleagues, etc. In fact, several times I would specifically mention that something is not to be shared with others, and still she would \"accidentally\" (unintentionally) share it. She would listen in on my telephone conversations with my friends. Whenever I would go to friends' houses, she would call randomly my friends to confirm where I was and accuse me of doing stuff (mostly some mischief) that I didn't do. It was horrible. I lost out on many good friendships because of my mother's behavior. When I moved away for college, I was determined to not introduce her to my college friends/teachers/acquaintances. If she ever met any of them, I ensured that she did not exchange numbers and contact info. In any conversations with my mother, I only share superficial unimportant information about my life. If she presses for more details, I simply say I don't recall and/or change the subject. I have tried to have constructive conversations on this issue with my mother, but it usually goes nowhere. Or on rare occasion, she apologies but does it again later. I love my mom and am grateful to her for many things, but I cannot have a close relationship with her. She is unpredictable with who she talks to and about what, so it is best to not provide any gossip fodder to her!\n\nMy advice to you is to go low contact with your mother. You are an adult and are not doing anything wrong. Our child innocently blurted something to his grandmother, and she is making a mountain out of a molehill. There was no need for her to share this with other people. If she genuinely had any concerns about your well-being, she would have spoken to you or maybe even your husband. My guess is that she loves to cause drama and spread gossip, even if it is at the expense of her own daughter. Seriously, why would she tell people that her daughter likes to be nude in a bathtub? What is the point of talking about this with others? So awkward!
