John\u2019s more\u2026 generic? Pretty much what you think of when you think 15yo boy that does sports. Annie\u2019s more on the \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit in\u201d side or at least that\u2019s what she thinks.\n\nAnyways, my sister called me last night and asked if I could take John for a couple nights. I said of course and asked why and she told me that Annie crossed a line.\n\nNow, John\u2019s report card from last year wasn\u2019t very good. He was pretty embarrassed by it but there was an underlying reason. He goes into these depression slumps often and yeah, my sister and her husband are talking to professionals but it\u2019s taking a very long time to get somewhere. Annie is aware of this and hasn\u2019t really expressed any concern but we figured she just doesn\u2019t get the seriousness of it. \n\nWell, apparently she took pictures of John\u2019s report card and posted it on her snap story. Most ppl didn\u2019t care but a select few (Annie\u2019s best friends) tried to make it this big thing. John and Annie have each other blocked but John\u2019s friends texted him about it and John got really upset. They had a massive fight and Annie said some horrible things about how he\u2019s just an idiot that\u2019s faking his slumps. She said things like \u201cI\u2019m the one that mom and dad should care about, not your privileged ass.\u201d \n\nIt was overall a very bad fight and my sister wants to get to the bottom of Annie\u2019s comments but she also doesn\u2019t want to subject John to Annie any longer. So I went to pick John up and while I was talking to my sister about the next few nights, Annie came out of her bedroom yelling at me and asking me if I\u2019m taking John\u2019s side too. I didn\u2019t say anything which upset her even more and she said \u201cI need someone on my side too, you\u2019re all taking his side because he\u2019s pretending to have depression and I assumed you would be smarter about this considering how intelligent you are but you\u2019re also just another victim of misogyny.\u201d \n\nMy sister seemed to be at a loss for words and I just went \u201cDo you even know what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d \n\nThis struck a nerve in Annie and she was like \u201cof course I fucking do, I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve been dealing with misogyny all my life and you questioning me like this just proves that you\u2019re just like all the other women in this goddamn country. You\u2019re a woman, how dare you question my experience\u2026\u201d or whatever else she said. She was using big words throughout and honestly she does have a point but it doesn\u2019t apply in this situation in my opinion.\n\nEither way, she actually made a tiktok about how her family is misogynistic etc and used my \u201cdo you even know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d thing as her main example and though this account is PRIVATE, she has a couple hundred followers that seem horrified by what I said. I know this because Annie has been sending me screenshots of these comments. AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nJust wanted to clarify that niece is not and was not being neglected because of John. My sister doesn\u2019t favor John, and no one expects my niece to drop everything for her brother. I don\u2019t think people understand but John did need extra attention for a while because his mental state was so unstable and he was in hospital. But Annie was never neglected. After he got out of the danger zone, a parent was always at home. They even had multiple heart to hearts with Annie about how she felt etc. No one\u2019s perfect and I\u2019m not saying we didn\u2019t make mistakes, but my sister\u2019s doing her best for both of her kids during this very difficult time. Please don\u2019t make assumptions about how bad of a mother my sister is because she isn\u2019t a bad mom.\n\nINFO: \nSome people are confused about the hospital stay. My nephew didn\u2019t eat for a couple days which ultimately led to hospitalization and us finding out that he has a mental illness. My niece was left \u201calone\u201d for a week which was the \u201cdanger zone\u201d I\u2019m referring to. I stayed with her for most of this week. She is completely capable of being alone and has basic life skills but I was there because of what the situation was like. Nephew came home some time later and they are currently looking for professionals to help further his treatment. I hope that explains some things. I had no idea this post would reach so many people so I just wrote this post off handedly without putting too much thought into it. My apologies. \n\nEdit 2:\n\nThought this was a given, but don\u2019t use this post as an excuse to shit on feminism and women\u2019s rights. I actually do agree with my niece about various things (which is why she called me intelligent and was so shocked I wasn\u2019t \u201con her side\u201d). I would call myself a feminist and I think that young women, especially girls my niece\u2019s age aren\u2019t taken seriously because of their age which is wrong. I don\u2019t like it and I think every girl regardless of well anything needs to heard. I was simply wondering if what I said was harmful.\n\nTwo things can exist at once. My niece isn\u2019t applying the feminist idea in the right way but she isn\u2019t wrong about feminism in general.", "created_utc": 1694450655, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16g098u/aita_for_asking_my_niece_if_she_knows_what_shes/", "score": 1159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How many men kill themselves because they don't know how to deal with their feelings. Go deep in that shit because it's scary how many go untreated. My cousin had the most amazing life, great job making a substantial income, lovely wife, nice big house, two beautiful daughters. He also shot himself in the face with a rifle three days after Christmas. Depression can happen to anyone and men go largely untreated because of the same type of crap your niece is spouting.

And empowering women is SO important, but feminism is about being equals, not about being *above* men. And I feel like she's missing this, as a lot of *adult* women do, also. This seems to have resulted in a superiority complex, which is something A LOT of teenagers experience but can be exacerbated when you have a movement behind you (especially when you're not fully grasping the scope in its entirety). She's taking a common sibling rivalry experience and turning it into something political. This is harmful not only to herself but the people who follow her and may see her as an influencer - this is an unhealthy perspective to have and creates an even greater divide between genders.\n\nShe also doesn't realize that her implications are ALSO misogynistic. \"Men aren't allowed to be depressed.\" \"Men can't cry.\" \"Men can't experience their feelings.\" This is ALL toxic masculinity that she is *enabling* with her claims.\n\nShe can't use feminism as a weapon like this, or as a way to garner attention or views or upvotes.", "NTA\n\nHave you considered that there may be sibling abuse?

That's not ok, but from how you describe her (feels like she doesn't fit in) and her behavior, she may be suffering from depression as well and frustrated that hers isn't being considered.  Depression runs in families and, last I heard, far more prevalent in females than males... but females ALSO mask it better.  The whole thing is a big old emotional mess, but even if she is 100% mentally a-ok, having a depressed sibling can ALSO cause a lot of stress... and she is a teenager, which is hard in and of itself.\n\nSince the point is voting, I'm going with a soft ESH because Annie was mean, you threw an unnecessary barb (not including parents and John due to lack of info).

You had a really fucking snide comment about how Annie is just making up how she doesn't fit in - just for the record your bias is *really* super obvious.

So if a man were to be particularly emotional, or cry, they're deemed weak as a direct correlation to being feminine/a woman = weak. \n\nWhile toxic masculinity is a spectrum and doesn't *always* overlap with misogyny, in this particular case it does due to the root of its cause.\n\nIt is SO important to recognize that both misandry and misogyny negatively impact ALL genders in so many ways, not just the ones they're targeted at. They share an idiom with \"resentment\" in that \"It's like drinking poison and hoping the other person gets sick.\"", "This is why I don't want to invalidate Annie's feelings. It's *entirely possible* she's feeling neglected and has some real shit she needs to have addressed.\n\nBut then there is an *extremely* tricky balance to strike here. There is ALWAYS going to be a time in a person's life, regardless of age, that they have to be OK with being in second place because another person may be in need of a particularly high amount of attention. This may be something Annie is unwilling to accept right now. And, while we're considering all of the possibilities here, we wouldn't do ourselves any favors by ignoring the fact that it's *still a possibility* Annie simply resents *not* being the center of attention, which is why it seems like she's chronically online seeking validation (a narcissistic personality disorder is still a mental illness that requires attention if the person in question ever wants to become a well-rounded being, but it's still not a good excuse to act like a toxic chemical spill). Let's also face it... it's not like it's exactly unheard of for a teenager to seek attention for attention's sake. Sometimes it's due to an underlying issue, but some just think they're Beyonc\u00e9 in a world of backup dancers and become personally offended and lash out when someone suggests otherwise. \n\nBeyond Annie's warped perspective of equality, her utter lack of empathy for her brother (who has seemingly done nothing to warrant this kind of response) is EXTREMELY concerning. She is solely focused on how things impact *her*. \n\nThen we have to ask ourselves: Where is the line? Where is the line between \"hurting people hurt people\" and \"this is NOT okay regardless of circumstance\"? And ultimately, none of us in the comments know where the line falls here. That is something that can't be known without knowing the people in this story personally, and even then it's hazy. It's manipulated by love and wanting to see the best in people (especially your family) and by fear.\n\nOne thing is absolutely needed and all of us in the comments seem to be in agreement on: This family needs to have a sit-down and possibly some family therapy to get a handle on this.

I didn\u2019t lash out like she did, but I had a hard time. I felt like I didn\u2019t fit in at school, I struggled with STEM which sucked because I was in the gifted program. I felt isolated from my family, and I had undiagnosed ADHD and autism. I listened to heavy music, was a closet emo and was really into social justice. \n\nI think that there can be a big issue with discussing privilege and similar issues at schools. I have heard several examples of misinformed educators distilling the whole theory of intersectionality down to pointing at cis white male students and telling them that their lives will be easier than their peers. I do believe that men get vilified at a young age and that can be so damaging for the soul. And it\u2019s not through malicious intentions. So Annie could be being misinformed or misunderstanding the feminism discourse she\u2019s reading and hearing. \n\nSimilarly, this is something I\u2019ve noticed and discussed in my degree. In a BA, a there\u2019s a bit of a competition to be the most progressive, most woke student there is. So you end up with students just being critical of everything without actually critiquing stuff. And that\u2019s when you end up with the stereotype of Arts students all being communists, because there\u2019s this pressure to be the most left-wing, radical, progressive person in the class. I\u2019m almost finished my BA in Criminology and Gender Studies, and it\u2019s so sad to me how there\u2019s criminology students in their last semester who are falling victim to this mindset and declaring that they\u2019ve majored in criminology but can\u2019t pursue it because they\u2019re going to do more harm than good because it\u2019s a toxic discipline. \n\nI was really interested in social justice at her age.

The goal is to help each other and lift each up to higher places than any of us have ever been by banishing the repressive old ways.

Shouldn\u2019t someone stand up for John with that accusation flying around?", "Feminism isn\u2019t just liberal feminism lol, you should educate yourself before commenting", "I love the phrase 'standing on the shoulders of giants but failing to look down'.", "I kind of disagree with you here, she's using a teenage interpretation of feminism because it seems like she's unhappy with her own current situation. That does not justify her actions towards her brother whatsoever, because a true feminist would understand that the societal stigma and patriarchal standards around mental health screws everyone over beyond belief, including her brother.  Also it's just bullying, plain and simple, and it's likely undeserved on her brother's part.", "OP should create a response video explaining that she asked the question in response to Annie claiming that believing a male family member had depression, depression so severe he had to be hospitalized, was misogyny. And that this occurred in response to Annie bullying this family member for his struggles with depression and the family refusing to condone the bullying.\n\nMaybe the internet backlash she\u2019ll face will wake her up. If nothing else, she\u2019ll probably delete her social media.", "Yeah I've also noticed how quick this subreddit is to call posts where the characters they identify with most are the AH. I'll list some below:\n\n* **Wife** vs Husband\n* **GF** vs BF\n* **young adult** vs their parents\n* **tenant** vs landlord\n* **someone** vs their in laws\n* **self proclaimed scapegoat** vs alleged golden child\n\nI've bolded the characters that this sub tends to identify with most (as per the demographics) and in posts where the above conflicts occur, this subreddit either defends the character no matter what or they call the post fake. It's because this subreddit struggles to vote someone they identify with as an AH.", "> If this was really a feminist issue why doesn't it ever get brought up in any feminist media, and only gets brought up defensively?\n\nIf you took 2 seconds to do a search in your search engine of choice for \"why do we invalidate the interests of teen girls\" you would find plenty of feminist media on this topic.", "Sounds like she\u2019s already struggling with her mental health ngl", "\ud83d\ude06 1000%\n\nTeenage girl 'lawyers' are relentless.", "No, I didn't say she was for sure neglected. What I said is that is very unusual to leave underage teenagers home alone for multiple nights and the fact OP glossed over that detail makes me wonder if there is more info that would make Annie's perspective more justified. \n\nIf this was written from another perspective, it is pretty easy to see how John could be seen as the golden child and Reddit would side with Annie.", "I didn't say they can't. I said it is pretty unusual and the fact the story glosses over that detail leads me to wonder what is missing from the story.", "We don't know how long it was. OP conveniently left that out, a long with any other mistakes they may have made which she admits did happen.", "What if she can't cook? Has no money to eat? Yes, many 16 year olds are stable enough to handle that challenge but some are not. The fact OP talks about it like it was absolutely no big deal and business as usual gives me major \"john is the golden child vibes\"", "Meanwhile her brother is in the hospital and she\u2019s alone and doesn\u2019t have anyone to talk to about it. Sounds traumatic and stressful.", "Sure, I understand the concepts being referred to.\n\nWe have a woman engaging in sexist behaviours towards a man, denying his agency and disregarding his problems out of some political idea of men=bad.\n\nMy perspective is that you shouldn't then take those problems he is facing, and then start throwing around words that blame men for it in response. It alienates men from any ideas of shared cause, and is actually a form of victim blaming.\n\nShe is responding to feelings of cultural misogyny by lashing out with misandry at her brother, and the above commentator is responding by doubling down on the ideas of cultural misogyny in an attempt to spike her guns.", "No, I understand and appreciate your points.\n\nI also think that it is important to highlight this story as an example of misandry (as you have definitely also done) where others were labelling it as form of misogyny without seeing that actual problem of man hating. I wanted to make it clear that this is labelled firstly as misandry, before the misogyny is bolted on.\n\nI also appreciate your use of toxic femininity, but as with toxic masculinity, it paints with too broad a brush. Definitely a good example of toxic feminism though - where the language being used is so strong its hardest adherents think orthopraxy is seeing all men as predatory and inherently dangerous.", "You have 2 teenagers. I'm not saying don't stand up for John, that's why I went ESH, I'm saying figure out why the other one is acting out so bad too.

You can both have consequences for her actions and listen and true and figure out why she's saying this and what's going on.\n\nThese are not mutually exclusive things", "The girl reminds me of my rage-induced, teenage self. I did not have the proper outlets nor did I know how to effectively communicate emotions, so much so that I blamed EVERYTHING I could think of: Parents fighting, unfair society, etc. you get the gist, but it was all because I couldn't really understand why I was feeling that way.", "Echo chambers don't work like that.", "You forgot CHILDFREE vs Parents.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s funny or depressing that this sub can be such a stark object lesson in how hard it is for people to understand perspectives beyond those close to them. It definitely is a hard thing to do sometimes and I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m hurling stones in my glass house, but that\u2019s a skill everybody needs to work on.", "Where did you find the demographics of this sub?", "Screamingly fake vs real story", "are you actively trying to miss the point of the person that you're replying to? I felt it was fairly obvious that the \"feminist issue\" in question was referring to yeOGOG's comment \"Young men getting help with mental illness is very much a feminist issue.\" BadWolfOfficial simply called out the fact that the only times that young men getting mental health help seems to actually get brought up in mainstream feminist sources is either defensively (as it was in yeOGOG's comment) or offensively (e.g. boys will do literally anything but go to therapy)", "you're describing the exact opposite of what I said.", "I don't know about Golden child, but Annie sure has ingredients for being the glass child if they're not careful. I think Annie is still the AH for what she did, but the dismissal of Annie's thoughts and feelings in this post can become a real issue. She's acting out. Her family needs to find out why.", "That's not particularly unusual at all tbh", "I'm sure she knows how to make a sandwich or a bowl of cereal, stop being so dramatic.", "There's google for one. It isn't hard to google some cooking tips or even a full recipe. \"Not knowing how to cook\" isn't a great example when there's multiple tools to help with that.\n\nIf she has no money to get food I'm more than sure her parents or the OP would've got some ingredient or even meals for her. Being left alone at 16 isn't bad at all, especially if it's because of a serious situation like this.\n\nThe bigger issue (without both stories) is that she's belittling her brothers mental issues and making it out to be fake when he's been hospitalised previously. Regardless of if he's the golden child or not, her actions are massively out of order.", "True, but teenagers are quick to turn on one another.", "How many times were you left alone overnight at 16 or younger?", "I'm not being dramatic?

Cause it'd sell more papers!\"", "\"or younger\" is pointless as the person is 16, obviously it's different if they are 8 or something\n\nbut a fair number of times, and it wasn't a big deal even remotely. Shit I was even responsible for making sure my younger siblings got fed.", "Sounds more like you want the story to be a certain way.", "Well we don't know. John's hospitalization could have been a few years ago, my whole point is OP yada yadas some parts of the story that may shape our outcome.\n\nSo you were left alone, multiple nights in a row as a 16 and not even placed in charge or your younger siblings? Just because you parents ditched you to get drunk and fuck off somewhere doesn't make that a normal parenting habit.", "lol judging my OP's second edit, its the other side that is pretending the story went a \"certain way\"", "usually a one night thing if they did an overnight somewhere, it was talked about ahead of time and I was paid it was cool for everyone lol\n\n16 year olds are nearly ready for college dude", "Also she was left alone while her brother was in the hospital. So she might have been scared without anyone to talk to. That doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior but that sounds traumatic."]}
