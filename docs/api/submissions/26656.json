John\u2019s more\u2026 generic? Pretty much what you think of when you think 15yo boy that does sports. Annie\u2019s more on the \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit in\u201d side or at least that\u2019s what she thinks.\n\nAnyways, my sister called me last night and asked if I could take John for a couple nights. I said of course and asked why and she told me that Annie crossed a line.\n\nNow, John\u2019s report card from last year wasn\u2019t very good. He was pretty embarrassed by it but there was an underlying reason. He goes into these depression slumps often and yeah, my sister and her husband are talking to professionals but it\u2019s taking a very long time to get somewhere. Annie is aware of this and hasn\u2019t really expressed any concern but we figured she just doesn\u2019t get the seriousness of it. \n\nWell, apparently she took pictures of John\u2019s report card and posted it on her snap story. Most ppl didn\u2019t care but a select few (Annie\u2019s best friends) tried to make it this big thing. John and Annie have each other blocked but John\u2019s friends texted him about it and John got really upset. They had a massive fight and Annie said some horrible things about how he\u2019s just an idiot that\u2019s faking his slumps. She said things like \u201cI\u2019m the one that mom and dad should care about, not your privileged ass.\u201d \n\nIt was overall a very bad fight and my sister wants to get to the bottom of Annie\u2019s comments but she also doesn\u2019t want to subject John to Annie any longer. So I went to pick John up and while I was talking to my sister about the next few nights, Annie came out of her bedroom yelling at me and asking me if I\u2019m taking John\u2019s side too. I didn\u2019t say anything which upset her even more and she said \u201cI need someone on my side too, you\u2019re all taking his side because he\u2019s pretending to have depression and I assumed you would be smarter about this considering how intelligent you are but you\u2019re also just another victim of misogyny.\u201d \n\nMy sister seemed to be at a loss for words and I just went \u201cDo you even know what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d \n\nThis struck a nerve in Annie and she was like \u201cof course I fucking do, I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve been dealing with misogyny all my life and you questioning me like this just proves that you\u2019re just like all the other women in this goddamn country. You\u2019re a woman, how dare you question my experience\u2026\u201d or whatever else she said. She was using big words throughout and honestly she does have a point but it doesn\u2019t apply in this situation in my opinion.\n\nEither way, she actually made a tiktok about how her family is misogynistic etc and used my \u201cdo you even know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d thing as her main example and though this account is PRIVATE, she has a couple hundred followers that seem horrified by what I said. I know this because Annie has been sending me screenshots of these comments. AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nJust wanted to clarify that niece is not and was not being neglected because of John. My sister doesn\u2019t favor John, and no one expects my niece to drop everything for her brother. I don\u2019t think people understand but John did need extra attention for a while because his mental state was so unstable and he was in hospital. But Annie was never neglected. After he got out of the danger zone, a parent was always at home. They even had multiple heart to hearts with Annie about how she felt etc. No one\u2019s perfect and I\u2019m not saying we didn\u2019t make mistakes, but my sister\u2019s doing her best for both of her kids during this very difficult time.

She needs to go off social media because she clearly went down a toxic rabbithole", "NTA, but I don't understand how John having depression is related to misogyny? She thinks he's faking and that whole world is in on it because \"men\"? Is that how that evolved?\n\nDo your niece a favor and hit her back with the stats around men and depression. How many men kill themselves because they don't know how to deal with their feelings. Go deep in that shit because it's scary how many go untreated. My cousin had the most amazing life, great job making a substantial income, lovely wife, nice big house, two beautiful daughters. He also shot himself in the face with a rifle three days after Christmas. Depression can happen to anyone and men go largely untreated because of the same type of crap your niece is spouting.

And empowering women is SO important, but feminism is about being equals, not about being *above* men. And I feel like she's missing this, as a lot of *adult* women do, also. This seems to have resulted in a superiority complex, which is something A LOT of teenagers experience but can be exacerbated when you have a movement behind you (especially when you're not fully grasping the scope in its entirety). She's taking a common sibling rivalry experience and turning it into something political. This is harmful not only to herself but the people who follow her and may see her as an influencer - this is an unhealthy perspective to have and creates an even greater divide between genders.\n\nShe also doesn't realize that her implications are ALSO misogynistic. \"Men aren't allowed to be depressed.\" \"Men can't cry.\" \"Men can't experience their feelings.\" This is ALL toxic masculinity that she is *enabling* with her claims.\n\nShe can't use feminism as a weapon like this, or as a way to garner attention or views or upvotes.", "NTA\n\nHave you considered that there may be sibling abuse?

Your niece is struggling, but she sees that only her brother is being given help. \n\nThis has gone through some twisted permutations of logic in her teenage mind and she\u2019s drawn the wrong conclusions.

That's not ok, but from how you describe her (feels like she doesn't fit in) and her behavior, she may be suffering from depression as well and frustrated that hers isn't being considered.  Depression runs in families and, last I heard, far more prevalent in females than males... but females ALSO mask it better.  The whole thing is a big old emotional mess, but even if she is 100% mentally a-ok, having a depressed sibling can ALSO cause a lot of stress... and she is a teenager, which is hard in and of itself.\n\nSince the point is voting, I'm going with a soft ESH because Annie was mean, you threw an unnecessary barb (not including parents and John due to lack of info).

You had a really fucking snide comment about how Annie is just making up how she doesn't fit in - just for the record your bias is *really* super obvious.

As of right now, they seem to be each other\u2019s worst enemy and they need space. I can see how it seems but my sister and her husband made sure that John knew why he was \u201cgoing away\u201d and not his sister. \n\nOnce again, don\u2019t worry. My niece is still my niece and I love her to bits. I care about her just as much as John and we will do whatever we can to help her. Thank you.", ">but females ALSO mask it better.\n\nAnd often families put a lot on oldest daughters, consciously or not.", "I never said she\u2019s treated perfectly, not even John is treated perfectly. I\u2019m saying that Annie is not neglected. How do I know? I literally lived with them for years and only moved out a couple months ago. Then when all this happened, I stayed over with Annie while her parents and John were at the hospital. \n\nYes, a single missed family trip because, get this, JOHN ALMOST DIED. More worried about John, yes they were, you know why? HE ALMOST DIED. Maybe not even that justifies it for you and maybe my sister shouldn\u2019t have had kids because she didn\u2019t give her teenage daughter the perfect amount of attention for a couple weeks while her son ALMOST DIED. \n\nI am not accusing her of being a \u201cposer.\u201d I am saying that she is mean to her brother because she thinks he\u2019s basic and a stereotypical white guy when she herself is a stereotypical teenage white girl. That is all I was implying. I have no favorites, I love them both the same but in different ways. \n\nIf I\u2019m the asshole that\u2019s fine, I accept that. What I don\u2019t \u201caccept\u201d are assumptions that either of the kids are being ignored, neglected etc. My sister and her husband aren\u2019t perfect, but this is one thing they didn\u2019t fuck up.", "My sister does take care of Annie just as much as she does John. In fact, she\u2019s closer to Annie and spends way more one on one time with her. That is why my sister wants to figure out where Annie is coming from.", "Yes, that is why John is staying with me while my sister and her husband figure out what\u2019s going on with her.", "I\u2019m not losing sleep over it, but if I did in fact do or say something wrong then I would like to know. For my overall betterment :)", "What you\u2019re saying about me is completely fair. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that my niece is being overlooked by her parents. The only reason they even found out about John\u2019s struggles is because he wouldn\u2019t eat for days and had to be rushed to the hospital. He seemed perfectly fine otherwise, which is usually what depression looks like. \n\nNow no one is saying that my niece has to go through something so terrible to be taken seriously, but you cannot blame her parents for being so overwhelmed. My sister is trying so hard to be there for both of her kids and even after the scare with John, the first thing my sister did was make sure Annie was okay and as far as everyone knew and could see, she was. Despite how stressed out they are, my sister and her husband have never once overlooked their daughter in the way you\u2019re implying. They\u2019re not mind readers and they\u2019re human. My sister can\u2019t sleep at night because she\u2019s so worried about her kids. I understand where you\u2019re coming from and I understand I said something stupid, but my sister and her husband are doing the best they can.", "I don\u2019t favor anyone. I was dumb, I made an unnecessary comment. I get that. I love them both. \n\nBut I don\u2019t understand, what would you have done? Of course John needed a little more attention, he didn\u2019t eat for days and had to be rushed to the hospital. My niece is not 5, she is 16. She can handle a few days without her parents while her brother is literally fighting for his life. \n\nThey cancelled a family trip during the summer but I mean what were they supposed to do? \u201cOh our son\u2019s in the hospital but we have to go on a trip otherwise our daughter will be sad so fuck him.\u201d Apart from this, she wasn\u2019t told to give up anything. She still had a fun summer. \n\nAnd you\u2019re making a lot of assumptions. John and her have equal responsibilities. He didn\u2019t do his chores for a couple weeks because you know: depression but it\u2019s not like my sister forced Annie to do them. And my sister and her husband don\u2019t give a shit about how \u201cperfect\u201d their grades are. Obviously if Annie is doing well in school and John is practically failing, they\u2019re not going to be worried about her grades. \n\nI understand your concern, and I understand my faults, but my sister is trying her best.", "I\u2019m not on anyone\u2019s side, first of all.

They're all gaining education, but lacking in the depth of life experience to properly inform their learning.  OP needs to realize that the screen shots of \"agreements\" and \"outrage\" are next to meaningless.   They're echo chamber statements from - likely - other teens who, like the niece also lack depth of life experience.", "I don't want to invalidate Annie's feelings.", ">Unfortunately, there are \"feminists\" who are more interested in knocking people down to the same level than elevating people up to the same level. Sounds like Annie is trying to be one of those people.\n\nI definitely agree with you here. I'm a believer in \"keeping your own house in order,\" so it can be a tough go at it when people in the community start lashing out like this and validating their frustration (which comes from a very real place) while also like \"That shit is not OK.\" I don't know anyone who wants to be represented like that other than the loud minority of people spreading such nonsense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Technically, Annie is being misandrist (someone who is prejudiced against men), but it's probably easier to just say that she's being sexist.\n\nRegarding this part, I explained my [intentional usage of \"misogynist\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16g098u/comment/k05d83r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in another comment. But you're right in that generally using the term \"sexist\" would be generally applicable.", "The thing is, those misconceptions about men come straight out of the misogyny/toxic masculinity handbook. In that line of thinking, women are lesser and bad, so men can\u2019t do anything that\u2019s traditionally \u201cfeminine,\u201d you know, like having emotions and stuff. \n\nSo many men are discouraged from seeking out a diagnosis or treatment for depression and other mental health conditions because therapy isn\u2019t masculine enough. \n\nMost of the things people call misandry are just the ways that misogyny and patriarchy harm men.", "While I left out the word \"internalized\" in this case, toxic masculinity can very much be a result of misogyny.\n\nThe examples I provided in relation to the post were references to being emotional, which are often deemed \"feminine\" qualities. So if a man were to be particularly emotional, or cry, they're deemed weak as a direct correlation to being feminine/a woman = weak. \n\nWhile toxic masculinity is a spectrum and doesn't *always* overlap with misogyny, in this particular case it does due to the root of its cause.\n\nIt is SO important to recognize that both misandry and misogyny negatively impact ALL genders in so many ways, not just the ones they're targeted at. They share an idiom with \"resentment\" in that \"It's like drinking poison and hoping the other person gets sick.\"", "This is why I don't want to invalidate Annie's feelings. It's *entirely possible* she's feeling neglected and has some real shit she needs to have addressed.\n\nBut then there is an *extremely* tricky balance to strike here. There is ALWAYS going to be a time in a person's life, regardless of age, that they have to be OK with being in second place because another person may be in need of a particularly high amount of attention. This may be something Annie is unwilling to accept right now. And, while we're considering all of the possibilities here, we wouldn't do ourselves any favors by ignoring the fact that it's *still a possibility* Annie simply resents *not* being the center of attention, which is why it seems like she's chronically online seeking validation (a narcissistic personality disorder is still a mental illness that requires attention if the person in question ever wants to become a well-rounded being, but it's still not a good excuse to act like a toxic chemical spill). Let's also face it... it's not like it's exactly unheard of for a teenager to seek attention for attention's sake. Sometimes it's due to an underlying issue, but some just think they're Beyonc\u00e9 in a world of backup dancers and become personally offended and lash out when someone suggests otherwise. \n\nBeyond Annie's warped perspective of equality, her utter lack of empathy for her brother (who has seemingly done nothing to warrant this kind of response) is EXTREMELY concerning. She is solely focused on how things impact *her*. \n\nThen we have to ask ourselves: Where is the line? Where is the line between \"hurting people hurt people\" and \"this is NOT okay regardless of circumstance\"? And ultimately, none of us in the comments know where the line falls here. That is something that can't be known without knowing the people in this story personally, and even then it's hazy. It's manipulated by love and wanting to see the best in people (especially your family) and by fear.\n\nOne thing is absolutely needed and all of us in the comments seem to be in agreement on: This family needs to have a sit-down and possibly some family therapy to get a handle on this. I don't envy parents having to navigate the extremely murky waters of being compassionate and ensuring their child's security while also trying to avoid enabling potentially problematic behavior.", "Spending time with someone doesn't solve their problems, but I hope your sister can figure out if your niece is also having mental health issues.", "Honestly, your niece talked nonsense about mental health/depression and thinks, feminism is about hate for men. I don't think she knows what she is talking about. She has much to learn.", "I see...\nJohn might be doing some therapy but isn't working so much. Might try a few changes with school (private tutor or group study), gym/sports and I'm guessing the impact that covid had is still afecting most students. Like going back from homeschooling to presence classes. Some workes are also in conflit from that too.", "\"Potentially problematic?\"  What's \"potentially\" about violating John's privacy and humiliating him by posting HIS report card on HER social media.  Actual objectively offensive verified actions > feelings.

Not necessarily Annie specifically who is actively being problematic."]}
