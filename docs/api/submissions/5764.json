His biological father and his biological father's family are all criminals and in and out of jail (or in the father's case, serving a very lengthy sentence). So I told the social worker I would adopt him and raise them together. It took some time.

I asked them why. They said it looks disrespectful and shameful. I told them I felt it was neither of those things. They asked how I could raise \"the boy\" and not find it incredibly insulting that he calls me by my name. At one point they questioned whether I truly loved him and saw him as my son, which pissed me off enough for me to tell them what he calls me is none of their concern and to keep their noses out of my family relationships.\n\nThey were insulted that I said this to them and they are making a bigger fuss than before.

That your son and you earned each others love and respect over many years. They have just forfeited your regard and any further attempt at interference in your family will result in your boot being kicked straight up their candy asses.

You have no intention of changing things and don't need to be solely addressed as \"Dad.\" The underlying reality of your relationship is what counts and that is where the real love and respect exists.", "NTA at all.\n\nMy goodness it's incredible what you did for this kid and I'm really thankful there are people like you in the world.\n\nIt's one thing to remove your name from the speech.  Even that is asking a lot from your son but for public perception it makes sense.  The whole wedding party doesn't need to know the particulars of your family situation and so it's okay to just use \"dad\" to avoid confusion.\n\nBut to suggest you don't love him is to cross the line.  What the hell do they know?  Did they adopt anyone?  Do they understand the challenges?  If not then they need to STFU.  And even still it's *your* family and so none of their business anyway.  What you said was an absolute minimum response.  Many in your situation would have said or done much worse.

Maybe if they happened to mention it to you in person at some point, that might have been slightly less egregious. But they felt they needed to call you to tell you that you and your son are wrong according to them.", "NTA\n\nRed flags from the inlaws.

These people just don't like to be contradicted and have decided that anyone who doesn't agree with them is \"rude.\" Honestly, I half expected the story to say you yelled at them after they questioned if you even loved your son. That is beyond rude, and disgusting on their part. If your future DIL was upset I'd say you should apologize anyway just to keep the peace, but since she doesn't care and it's not even the parents' wedding,  I don't think they are owed anything.

This has to be intimidating for him as I\u2019m sure his desire is to please his IL. You showed him how to stand up to whomever and I think that was a beautiful lesson.

If it doesn\u2019t, then their hangup on this is their failing in basic manners, not yours.\n\nFamilial relationships are about so much more than names and bloodlines.

Now I\u2019m going to call her tomorrow and remind her of that.", "> \"nip this in the bud\"\n\nFirst of all, the \"bud\" was when he was 10 so I don't know what they're on about, this is how you've been operating for over a decade. It is a fully fledged in bloom rose.  \n\n\nSecond of all, they're weird and stubborn about some arbitrary crap they've determined is \"dIsResPecTfUl\" and need to stay out of your relationship with your son, which btw seems lovely.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, but your future in-laws are.\n\nGlad to see FDIL seems to have your back.", "NTA\n\nWhat you have with your son, is a functional relationship, that would be similar to that of a stepparent and child, where both are civil and there is not only respect but also trust and mutual love for the other.  This is not a bad thing and if his IL have that much of a problem then that is on them, not you and not him.  \n\nThe relationship between you and him is one that you both agree on and that is all that matters in the end.", "NTA.\n\nKudos to your FDIL for standing up to her A-H parents, gotta love when partners support their partners because so many don't; especially on this sub.", "NTA. Future IL\u2019s are the assholes. They are rude, disrespectful, overbearing and controlling. You have every right to assert your boundaries with these self righteous assholes. I feel badly for your son having to deal with these hypocritical uptight judgemental controllers as his IL\u2019s.", "Nta and i love that dil is not putting up with their nonsense. Pushy in laws and hurt a relationship so its good she wont let them walk all over her", "NTA. ignore them.  Be yourselves.", "NTA. I do wonder OP are they of a different cultural background? They may have an issue with the speech at the wedding and how that would be perceived within their community more than the day to day. But ultimately, no you\u2019re not the asshole here. And neither is your son.", "you are awesome. NTA x 1 million.", "NTA. What your son calls you is between you and him. It\u2019s obvious from the post that you do not find it disrespectful at all that he uses your first name\u2026 if you don\u2019t find it disrespectful, that\u2019s all that matters.", "NTA, should\u2019ve asked them why aren\u2019t you comfortable enough or why do you see yourself on such a higher level to have your children only refer to you by titles?", "NTA, I think you win the parent of the year award.  I'm sure plenty of comments here have said it already but thank you for being a good person and fostering quality relationships with your children based off of love and a mutual respect.  A title does not denote respect, actions do and it seems based on your son and your actions you both respect each other greatly.", "NTA. I assume their childhoods were conventional. They are probably just naive and sheltered.", "NTA.\n\nIf you are fine with what your son calls you, then it's ok.", "Grandmama, it\u2019s me! Anastasia!", "You are definitely NTA OP,  you're a fucking hero", "Not The Asshole.", "NTA - how could you be, you are one of life's good guys. I am a single mother and my 20 year old son calls me mum and sometimes dad as i have fulfilled both roles, it makes my heart sing", "Good man. Leave them to their ignorance, keep loving your son and his soon to be wife.", "I always said that if you\u2019re in a busy place and yell daddy or dad then a dozen men will turn around but if you yell out their middle name if it\u2019s embarrassing or their full name, only one person turns around. I never stuck with one name for my parents. They were never mom and dad. Momma and daddy were common but I had a variety of nicknames for them depending on my mood."]}
