My daughter is my biological child. She's 24. My son is her older half brother and he's 29. Their mother, and I hate to call her that, was a hookup. We slept together twice and my daughter was the result. I never knew about her until she was 5 and her brother was 10 and they were removed from their mother's care. She did not take care of them and their school became concerned because my son was raising my daughter essentially. She told them I was my daughter's father and that I was not to know about her. But they wanted to try and place the kids with family first. My son had no family. His biological father and his biological father's family are all criminals and in and out of jail (or in the father's case, serving a very lengthy sentence). So I told the social worker I would adopt him and raise them together. It took some time. Even though it would keep the kids together, I was not a foster parent before this so they were extremely reluctant to place my son with me. Ultimately, both kids suffered not being together and I was thankfully able to keep my kids together.\n\nMy son calls me my name or dad. It's interchangeable really. He only met me when he was 10 and I was a stranger at first. So it took time for us to become a true father and son, even after I adopted him. I never felt like him calling me dad was a must. I know he loves me. I know I am his dad, to him, and to me. But our family is not typical and trauma and time play a part in our relationship. We adore each other and he tells me everything so I consider that a win.\n\nBut my son's future ILs are bothered by the fact he uses my name so often. It apparently became a problem when they heard him rehearse a speech with his fianc\u00e9e where he was using my name and dad for me. They complained to their daughter, who told them to leave it, but then they decided to give him a hard time and later they decided I should \"nip this in the bud\" and that I need to speak to my son and make him show the proper respect and decorum by dropping my name entirely from the speech and his vocabulary during the wedding entirely. I asked them why. They said it looks disrespectful and shameful. I told them I felt it was neither of those things. They asked how I could raise \"the boy\" and not find it incredibly insulting that he calls me by my name. At one point they questioned whether I truly loved him and saw him as my son, which pissed me off enough for me to tell them what he calls me is none of their concern and to keep their noses out of my family relationships.\n\nThey were insulted that I said this to them and they are making a bigger fuss than before.

My daughter has been calling me & my wife by our names for 30 years and we have a great relationship. We adopted and, like you, I know that the bond is nothing to do with names or sperm. \n\nI suggest working out exactly how you want to put it, even bounce ideas off of appropriate friends or relatives, but it's definitely correct (in fact incumbent) for you to tell them to shove their weak-minded bullshit up their flabby assholes. That your son and you earned each others love and respect over many years. They have just forfeited your regard and any further attempt at interference in your family will result in your boot being kicked straight up their candy asses. You may wish to go a bit harder than that - I was trying to work in the phrase \"flying Philadelphia fuck\" in there but I was foaming at the mouth too much to see the keyboard :)\n\nMore importantly have a great time and congratulations on gaining a daughter. I'm sure you'll get the in laws on side in the end.", "NTA. Even their daughter knows what they're doing is over the line.

NTA.  Your sons future-in-laws are though.", "Nta\n\nYour poor future DIL to grow up with them as parents!", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA You are right, but I wonder if there was a better way to approach this. \n\nEven now you could talk to them and try to get them to see that you would rather have a natural and sincere relationship with your son based what is comfortable for him rather than try to force something which you don't care about anyway, as you know that he cares for you and respects you. \n\nYou can only see forcing things causing discord and in this case with them forcing things it is bringing unnecessary strain in their relationship with your son and even you.\n\nCould they please understand that while their thoughts are well meant, you have been dealing with this ever since you adopted him and you are both comfortable with how things are now. You have no intention of changing things and don't need to be solely addressed as \"Dad.\" The underlying reality of your relationship is what counts and that is where the real love and respect exists.", "NTA at all.\n\nMy goodness it's incredible what you did for this kid and I'm really thankful there are people like you in the world.\n\nIt's one thing to remove your name from the speech.  Even that is asking a lot from your son but for public perception it makes sense.  The whole wedding party doesn't need to know the particulars of your family situation and so it's okay to just use \"dad\" to avoid confusion.\n\nBut to suggest you don't love him is to cross the line.  What the hell do they know?  Did they adopt anyone?  Do they understand the challenges?  If not then they need to STFU.  And even still it's *your* family and so none of their business anyway.  What you said was an absolute minimum response.  Many in your situation would have said or done much worse.  NTA at all.", "NTA - I still refer to my father as \"dad\" even though I have nothing to do with him due to the kind of person he is.

Thank you for choosing to be a dad. Also, good luck with those crazy in-laws.", "NTA \n\nFirst and foremost, we\u2019ll done on the parenting. Not only did you give your son a good home with his sister, you raised him in a way that taught him to make good choices. And that shows in the way his fianc\u00e9e is also on his side on the whole subject. \n\nYour anger at the in-laws isn\u2019t the problem. Maybe if they happened to mention it to you in person at some point, that might have been slightly less egregious. But they felt they needed to call you to tell you that you and your son are wrong according to them.", "NTA\n\nRed flags from the inlaws.  People who are worried about \"respect\" so much have rarely earned it themselves and are usually insecure about their hidden fear of being lower status.", "NTA obviously \n\nBut I also wanted to add that I think you\u2019re an incredible person for taking him on in the first place and keeping him with his sister \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta.

I'm also so glad that DIL has your son's back with her family. Her overly imposing and judgmental family is something she and your son will have to deal with. I think all you have to do is ask them both how they feel you can best support them.\n\nThe life you and your son have lived is not what created this point of contention.

That should be the end of the story.\n\nAsk them if they were hoping he would call them mom and dad after the wedding. Is that what this is really about? Because why would they care so much?", "NTA. Your these future In Laws are WAY out of line. You did nothing wrong and your son is doing nothing wrong. As a speech pattern it might be mildly strange for others to hear, when someone keeps flip flopping between two names for the same person. However there is really nothing wrong or improper about it at all - just slightly different than what one is used to.", "As someone who refers to her parents by their first name sometimes, it\u2019s because it\u2019s established that they\u2019re comfortable with it. The IL\u2019s really should be minding their own fucking business", "NTA they sound demented.", "Nta.\n\n In my family we call each other by out names, not the family connection. \n\nYes I have called my parents  by their giving names.    It doesn't freaking matter.", "NTA\n\nYou were and are a standout to your son. Without you he'd be separated from his sibling and in care system. You are wonderful, OP!\n\nGlad future DIL is showing spine too. Those people need to butt out.

It\u2019s yours and you don\u2019t care", "NTA. They are indeed sticking their noses into something that is absolutely none of their business. Time to draw a hard boundary.

My younger daughter called her father by his first name until she was five because her older half sister called her stepdad by his first name. We thought it was hilarious.\n\nYour future in-laws need to drop the whole thing.", "NTA\n\nWhy do they need you to be called \"Dad\" all the time to validate THEIR feelings? You raised your kids, not them! If YOU are fine with how your son addresses you, then that should have \"nipped it in the bud\", no? Some people look for drama everywhere! Stand your ground, OP, they're being ridunkulous", "NTA\n\nFrom the way you worded this it sounds like you were as diplomatic as possible. These people just don't like to be contradicted and have decided that anyone who doesn't agree with them is \"rude.\" Honestly, I half expected the story to say you yelled at them after they questioned if you even loved your son. That is beyond rude, and disgusting on their part. If your future DIL was upset I'd say you should apologize anyway just to keep the peace, but since she doesn't care and it's not even the parents' wedding,  I don't think they are owed anything. You made your feelings clear in a respectful way, they are simply disrespectful and unreasonable people.", ">they decided I should \"nip this in the bud\"\n\nThat ship has sailed a long time ago, lol\n\nNta", "NTA they are rude and they should mind their own business. How your SON call you is between both of you and no one have to say anything about it!\n\nYou are a great dad so don\u2019t listen to those crazy people but you and son must put boundaries with them or it will be a living hell!", "Oh yes, it's incredibly frustrating and not the first time someone has spoken on it. But most have the decency or common sense to drop it when they are told I don't mind or will not change it for them.", "I have always seen it as how could I not? How could I not love and adopt him? He's the person who raised my daughter for the first five years of her life. He's the only reason she was safe and he had nobody else. I'm just so proud of the man he's become and the fact our relationship only gets closer with time.", "That was explained to them by their daughter. I also know they are very aware of the family history and dynamic. So I feel like they just want to be stubborn and make things look a certain way. If I thought for one second they would respect things I would try talking to them again but it's clear public perception is a big deal for them.", "Yea, there is little decency happening from their end. To he honest, I'm most worried about your son's future. I hope this isn't an indication of how they are in general. At least your FDIL's behavior is a good sign!", "Dang it, I need another tissue. Seriously, you have increased my hope in humanity.", "How beautiful... Here you can have one of mine!", "welp im crying. NTA OP", "Ah... In that case I think you are taking the right approach as they need a clear line drawn for them that they are told they shouldn't cross. What a pity they are creating drama where there doesn't need to be any, for such a petty reason. I hope they can get over themselves with time.", "She's amazing and has been a great addition to our little family."]}
