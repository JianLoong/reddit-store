They would hang out without me and I was okay with it as long as they told me when they were hanging out and what they were doing. Turns out they weren\u2019t telling me everything and she had taken him with her to get her nipples pierced and didn\u2019t want to tell me bc they didn\u2019t want me to accuse them of doing anything. I found out the lie and they confessed they fucked up. I ended both relationships on the spot bc lying is my biggest no-no. Less than 24 hrs later, my ex was moved into her bedroom and her soon to be ex-husband was moved into one of the 4 kids rooms. My ex wanted to buy my truck off me and hadn\u2019t paid me anything yet, but after finding out they were sleeping together (and he did confirm they had s*x), I went to their house in the middle of the night, wrote \u201cwhore\u201d in chalk on their garage door, tossed everything in the truck that wasn\u2019t mine onto their front lawn, and took my truck back home with me.\n\nEdit: I would like to add that she was my \u201cbest friend\u201d for the same 3 years that my bf and I dated.
