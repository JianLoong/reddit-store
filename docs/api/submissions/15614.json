She said I care too much about what others think. Her examples were me telling her to turn down the music because it\u2019s loud. What I told her is to turn it down it certain areas. Example a very busy street where I live is known for its 4 or maybe 5 blocks of only restaurants, grocery stores etc. Her music is so loud when I open the back door of my house I can hear her music clearly. I told her it\u2019s rude and immature and embarrassing. So basically we\u2019re driving down a very nice neighborhood with tons of people walking down the street and she says she doesn\u2019t care. The music I wouldn\u2019t consider appropriate for kids and would definitely hurt elders ears. I told her I don\u2019t care if you play it loud on the freeway or a busy road but there\u2019s a time and place. Not everyone is perfect and I did that when I was younger but I matured and no longer do that that. Then proceeds to say another reason which was I never want to do anything fun anymore. She said I don\u2019t wanna do anything fun anymore like hop this fence into a private gym where we used to work. I told her we\u2019re not young anymore and can get arrested and a fine for that now. There\u2019s active security there 24/7. I\u2019ve said she immature and selfish and she says I\u2019m the immature one and have no right to talk. Am I overreacting?

Are you sure it's just about these irrelevant things ?

Like taking her to new places, experimenting new restaurants,bars...etc.  I say this because there is a point in every long relationship that we get too accommodated and kinda stop caring. I'm not saying about lack of love, but we kinda stop investing in it. We don't think we \"need\" to go to the movies cuz we got Netflix, or go out and eat in a new place cuz we can cook or the place is too far.

I need attention from strangers even if it's negative attention\" you're both still young and you have probably grown as far as ya'll were meant to with each other. She may be right that you both are simply not compatible anymore. That's okay. It's not the end of the world. At least the separation can be amicable.", "You can do a lot better than her. Tell her goodbye. I bet she wants to get back together within a day or two", "NTA  However, she is right, you are not compatible.   Walk away.  You can do better.", "kinda of like i dot wanna hear her music so thank you but who cares", "I have always been very suspicious of really nice, decent, polite, considerate people who are married to absolute AHs and I've known a few, both men and women.\n\nWhat is it about his nice person that makes them like the AH they are with/married to? What is it about them that I am not seeing? Are they acting as a front for their AH partner? What advantage are they, as a couple, trying to gain?\n\nDon't be one of those people. If others come to doubt the kind of person you are, even if you dump your GF, their opinion about you will remain unchanged. You will always be tainted.\n\nYour partner is acting like a fourteen year old where you seem to have grown up. However old she may be, you are an adult man dating a young teenage girl.\n\nShe's right. You are no longer compatible and you are also NTA. Dump her and find an adult to date.", "to many of yall need to stop sayin dump her dam", "Agreed. It sounds more like you\u2019re considerate of others, and she is not. If she\u2019s so determined to be inconsiderate that she\u2019s willing to break up with you, that\u2019s her showing you how important she considers herself and how unimportant she considers others. Listen to this and decide what is best for you.", "Yeah all this haha. I can't believe one of her reasons was that he doesn't want to do a B&E, and she then calls him immature? \ud83e\udd23 NTA, OP. You have common courtesy and respect, and she sounds like she hasn't grown up yet.", "Just a guess and a little analysis of her character based on the little information given", "People who are proud of being assholes are the worst.", "I live on a busy street, we keep windows open for air and its the worst when people drive by with music and engines blaring while I'm trying to enjoy my day. I appreciate someone like you OP, vs your gf who sounds very obnoxious and one to say \"you were more fun when you use to drink\" to an alcoholic. She seems wants to party than to settle down.", "Fucking what?", "That\u2019s five year olds for you", "I mean... Your GF made an observation about your relationship that your whole post seem to validate. So I don't get why you're the one offended by that.\n\nI think yes, it's a soft YTA because your GF came to talk about a \"problem\" in your relationship, a problem that you also have been aware of, and your answer was to tell her she is immature and selfish instead of explaining you outgrew these activities with her.\n\nI wonder who really is the immature one", "NTA you dodged a bullet. The things you care about are just being respectful and not breaking the law for stupid shit. Don\u2019t go back to this relationship she seems like a really bad influence", "Tbh, it\u2019s rude in most neighbourhoods, not just the upscale ones. NTA", "It is rude. And inconsiderate. You are right and she is wrong - but that's no help if you want to stay together. \n\nAre you sure you do? You might be waiting a very long time for her to grow up. \n\nNTA", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" recently said she thinks we\u2019re not compatible anymore, not that she wants to breakup.\" .. This is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I\u2019ve said she immature and selfish\" .. you will learn that this is not how you treat a partner you want to keep.  Is it 5 years because you were away a lot of that time? Y T A for that. Why would she accept her partner denigrating her like that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and was in Marine corps and was always taught manners and common courtesy.\" .. And you dobn't think that was a little bit too much indoctrination to actually work in civil life? And: You probably learned to adhere to this standard yourself. Calling out others for not holding an artificial standard they never agreed to makes you an AH. I can understand why she would not want to have kids with you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not compatible .. neither of you is right or wrong, you are just too different.", "NTA. There\u2019s a line between \u201cnot caring about what others think\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m an adult and I\u2019m being respectful of shared spaces because that\u2019s how I want to be treated.\u201d\n\nYou want to be treated like an adult. She wants to be treated like a child.", "NTA OP.  I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve been subjected to loud music from someone playing hip-hop on their car stereo just walking down the street.  It\u2019s a freaking nuisance.", "So then how is op an ah when you take the fact its am ashole thing to blast music with pride because op is not the one doing"]}
