All well and fun. I make sure my daughter knows what the risks are of drinking and going out and she doesn't party too hard. I let her know she can always call me if she needs to and I'll pick them up under any circumstance. The same goes for all of her friends and I make sure they at least have my contact in their phone. \n\nHowever her best friend is a different story. I don't think she was ever given the talk about what's safe to do and she regularly overdoes it. I see this when Kelsey brings Keira to my house and she is very drunk. Usually I'll get her a bottle of water, any snacks to sober up and we send her back home to her parents to deal with the consequences. \n\nHowever, this time my daughter lost Keira in the club. I'm not sure how, usually they're attached by the hip but my daughter let me know she could not find her. My daughter left the club and came home without Keira (i've talked to her about this). Keira called me about half an hour later, saying her battery died but found someone with a charger.  Immediately I left to pick her up. It was quite late and she's sobered up somewhat on the drive so I took her straight home. \n\nToday, Keira's parents informed me that they no longer felt comfortable allowing her to be at my house. They did not realise she had my number and felt it was of predatory nature that I, a single dad, was alone with her whilst she had been drinking and took her home. That they did not know why I was alone with her at all and Kelsey should have been with us. \n\nI explained that my daughter was separated from her and came home. Because she was still drunk, I let her recover at home whilst I dropped their daughter off to them. I reassured them nothing happened and that the most important thing to me was making sure Keira got home safely and was not taken advantage of in a taxi or by someone in the club. \n\nThey are sending all kinds of messages to my ex-wife about me being a predator which she sent to me. I just wanted to be sure both girls were home safe.

It\u2019s not unheard of for assault to happen with Uber drivers or other club patrons so that is a valid concern with a single drunk woman. Sure, there are incidents between the parent and the babysitter or the parent and their child\u2019s friend but you can\u2019t live life assuming that everyone is like that. And married parents are no more safe than unmarried parents when it comes to what could go wrong and it\u2019s no longer the 1800s when young  women need a chaperone to be around single men. These parents need to make decisions based on whether or not *she* trusts you and not how they think the optics of the situation look.", "NTA.

Not her parents, regardless of whether she lives at home. \n\nI also think it would be doing Keira a real solid if you found a way to gently communicate to her that her parents\u2019 level of involvement in her life (they called this man to tell them they don\u2019t feel comfortable ALLOWING her at his home??) is abnormal and developmentally inappropriate. This girl has been done a huge disservice by her parents in that they haven\u2019t prepared her to be an independent adult, capable of handling herself re: alcohol, and I highly doubt that\u2019s the only way they\u2019ve f-ed her over with their controlling mentality.

I can see your the more responsible adult in this situation because this just goes to show that if your daughter was in the same position as Kiera I doubt they would even bat an eye and they would leave an innocent girl alone and what could possibly go wrong a lot of things .

You made sure their drunk daughter got home safe and they return the kindness by calling you a predator? Just cuz you're a single dad? Nope. This reeks of sexism.   I wonder if the family is super strict around alcohol and the friend is overindulging as a way of rebelling, but that's not your concern.\n\nIf they're harassing you and messaging your ex, it's probably worth a trip to the lawyer to send them a letter to stop. They can hurt your reputation, your career, etc depending on what they're saying and are committing libel/defamation if they are lying about what happened.", "INFO: I think there is a lot of information missing here.

I see where her parents are coming from, I just don't understand how they can worry about you and not about literally THE WHOLE CLUB FULL OF DRUNK MEN WHERE SHE WAS ALSO DRUNK. Also everybody in this story is so cavalier about constant alcohol consumption in their kids... I guess it must be how it is now but I'm really surprised.", "NTA. But her parents are woefully unaware. On the one hand they see you as a predator, on the other hand they are ignorant of the real dangers their daughter is facing due to her lifestyle.

I'm afraid Keira is in real danger, due to their controlling and her lack of knowledge and experience.", "NTA", "NTA - They're being ridiculous, you did an amazing favor for somebody and they owe you a debt of gratitude. You're right, she COULD have been taken advantage of by somebody, especially with no cell phone, alone in the club, that's a bad situation. \n\nMake sure your daughter knows not to leave her friends, that's bad homie behavior 101. Secondly, tell Keira what they said when you can, definitely in person not on the phone. And get her opinion on it. Their opinion matters very little, when overall safety is concerned you did the right thing. If the situation arises again, Keira left alone somewhere, you can always just record your entire trip on your phone or something. It's a classic case of \"trust but verify\" you have a record then that all you did was pick her up, take her back to her house, and go home. \n\nIt's ridiculous obviously, but no good deed goes unpunished in this day and age. That rule you have with your kid and their friends is the same one my dad had with me and it was great, I think I only ever had to call him once and it was a pretty funny story.

This is absolutely ridiculous. They should apologize and thank you.", "NTA \n\nIf her parents are having ideas like that, stay away from Kiera.

Time to be a real dad.\n\nHis daughter is an adult. He has no control over who she makes as friends and what she does with those friends. I think it's quite an achievement that his daughter is responsible enough to monitor her own drinking while taking care of her friend who can't. The best thing he can do is teach his own daughter what reasonable limits are and always be there to support her if she needs it.", "Okay I will address your questions. No she called from her phone, she found someone with a charger. My daughter was also called but we didn't hear as she had put it on charge. She has my number because she has called me on behalf of my daughter before hence why I also have her number\n\nMy daughter left because her phone was going to die soon and she didn't want to be stranded at the club with no phone. She was panicked when she got back, it wasn't blas\u00e9 as you assume. I have always talked with her about leaving no man behind. It's the unspoken rule about going out with your friends. This was a one-off circumstance. \n\nWhy do you think I am enabling reckless and dangerous behaviour? If that were the case, I would not go out of my way to be a safe avenue for her friends and Kelsey to get home.", "Yes definitely. She knows that you always leave the club with the same amount of people you went with. This was just an unfortunate accident and a one off", "Thankyou. I hope they consider that also", "Your kid and her friend are legal adults. Ignore her crazy family, and keep being the parent Keira needs.", "That's not your problem and neither is Kiera.  Kiera is an adult and can go wherever she likes whether her parents approve or not.  I guess they could kick her out or stop paying her bills, but again not your problem.  NTA.", "What an absurd leap to make based on almost no information.", "And the gold medal for conclusion jumping goes to...", "Sometimes I read these stories and wonder how these people function in society.\n\nLike, how can they blame OP for their own failures?", "did you not bother to read the comment after it...LOL", "Good to hear she caught a ride.", "Oh dad, you have the **biggest** blinders on, ever. It is clear you love your daughter and want to support her friends, but hear me out.. \n\nThese girls are 22/21, not 15. Your daughter and friend are old enough to know better. By your own admission you've had conversations with both of them about this already. And beyond that, you are a parent, *not their friend*\n\nI think what you did is objectively good, and got her home safely in one piece. That's what ultimately matters... However you should be upset as well, and you should not blame her parents, religious or not, for being upset. \n\nThe cell phone point is moot to me, daughter could have texted her friend and said I want to leave, I'm standing in front of this location, my phone is about to die I'm putting it on airplane mode please meet me here right now. I knew to do that when I was 15. How was there no backup plan or conversation or even the thought to look at their cell phone battery percentage before they left the house? I would never care about having a working phone over prioritizing making sure my best friend, who I arrived at a specific location with, was alive and not shoved in the backseat of a car driving away from said location. Daughter could have called you from the bar or an employees phone after locating friend. She could have take two laps around the venue. Asked an employee if they've seen this girl wearing x, does she have a tab opened at the bar to indicate she's still there?\n\nCell phone point is further moot because the friend found a charger..? Like? I've never been to a bar where there weren't charges behind the bar, I say this as a bartender. Idk a woman that goes out without a charger. Respectfully, it sounds like your daughter didn't even try. How was she incapable of finding her friend at a bar they were both at.  If your daughter was so panicked when she got home, how did she not have her cell phone attached to her hand? It sounds like she just had dad come to the rescue. \n\nIf your daughter and her friend were in my friend group, I would call them a liability. I would know that they don't know how to use common sense and someone is going to have to babysit them when we are out. I would know that I can't rely on your daughter to look out for me if I ended up drinking too much. I would see how babied your daughter is, and how she can get you to do basically whatever, at her will. As a bartender, I would sincerely question if it was morally or legally in my best judgment to continue to serve your daughter based on the decisions she makes. And you, Dad, are the wall between your daughter and those very important social interactions that get that point through skulls and instill skills to plan, cope, regulate drinking, and keep you and your tribe safe. She should feel embarrassed, and ashamed. Emotions teach us important lessons so we can grow. All of the options I mentioned in the above paragraph? Why did none of those things occur to your daughter if you have talked to her about responsibility?\n\nI'm not trying to hate on you, your parenting, or your daughter. But what exactly have you taught her about drinking responsibly, and what has she done to show you she can handle that responsibility? Because if it has come to the point where your friends have your phone number, then this must be a theme. You should be extremely disappointed in your daughter.\n\nI agree with the friend's parents... Not that you are predatory, but just like I would not want to go out drinking with your daughter, I would not want my daughter hanging out with your daughter. Drinking responsibly extends to the company we keep. I would say, look your friend has no idea how to even keep her head on straight, and her father keeps putting her head back on for her instead of teaching her how to do it herself. Stay away from that, that is dangerous. \n\nAgain, theyre 22/21, not 15. There were so many options available to the both of them, this was not a \"last resort\" senario as the \"call me if you're in a pinch\" rule implies. And also, that rule existed for me too, but dissolved when I turned 18. \n\nYTA for minimizing all of this, and being like, *Pikachu face* \"what? I'm the knight in shining armor in this senario\". You're missing the point entirely. \n\nYour daughter fucked up and put her friend in possible danger. You not getting that would be a problem as a parent for me, too. That's you enabling reckless behavior. The fact that you think your daughter knows more about drinking responsibility than her friend, shows recklessness on your end. Omitting your daughter's behavior as the entire reason you drove her friend home, further shows recklessness. Again, shielding her from the consequences of her actions\n\nEDIT: You lied by omission to friend's parents. You drop their daughter off drunk with no explanation? When there is a perfectly reasonable explanation? But you don't want to get your daughter in trouble? It looks extremely suspicious from their point of view, you got to admit it. Stop being the cool dad, and be a parent \n\n(Sorry I hope this wasn't too harsh, youre obviously extremely well intentioned)", "Perhaps I'm not understanding, how would calling her parents have started an argument?", "My old neighbor was a sheltered kid.\n\nBy the time they sent her off to college (which she chose the closest college not in her hometown - only 100 miles away), she was pregnant by the end of the first semester. She couldn't drink when she turned 21 as she was breastfeeding her newborn (*third* child).\n\nFor a religious, sheltered upbringing...I'm surprised Keira made it to 21 without all the other mistakes I've seen sheltered girls fall into. But she may be like the other homeschooled, sheltered girl I know...didn't go to college (because it was \"liberal indoctrination\") and will only leave home *after* she gets married.", "Projection it is called. And I completely agree with that train of thought. \n\nAlso, If they can\u2019t think why their daughter called someone else and not them in need the parents really need to think through. I know parents can be strict but these look like are very much aware that the daughter drinks and are ok with it. They should be grateful that OP went to pick up Keira and not just left her", "It is a bit of  a leap.  But not a huge one.  If someone helped out my kid, my mind wouldn't jump to predation.

To a great extent, it doesn't matter what her parents think as long as KIERA feels safe around you. I'd still CYA and be cautious, because maybe there's something in her that you're not seeing (tale telling to avoid her parents disapproval?) but keep an eye. It's possible you're the one experienced adult she can ask for help when shit goes south, and that reaction from the parents means SOMEONE in this picture has a.dangerous inclination toward weaving harmful and baseless stories.

Saying she did the best she could, or x wasn't her fault, robs her of the opportunity to be introspective. It creates a mindset that admitting any fault, or taking accountability is shameful. It will embolden her to behave the same way the next time. \n\n\nI said in my second comment, ultimately you got friend home safely and that's what matters most. \n\nWhat I would have done was had a conversation with friends parents, explained that there was cellphone service problem on your daughter's end and they got separated. (No fault on anyones part. Its just a thing that happened.) That youre still getting details and that you give all her friends your number in case of emergency. Friend called, and you wanted to be a reliable and safe ride home. That her parents can trust you when their daughter is around yours. That you will be having a conversation with your daughter about how to best avoid this in the future so the issue won't be happening again, so they can rest easy. That you're sorry for the stress (not to admit fault, but bc you can empathize with the position they feel they are in). To respect them as parents of someone you care enough about to be the DD for.\n\nThen, I would have explained to your daughter about the responsibility of staying together w friends, keeping a charger on her, and having a meet up location and leaving time. A back up plan. Explained all of the options I said in my above comments. Give her tools, and resources to rely so she can be a little more confident when independent or in a pinch. So she has recourse because one day Dad, you're not going to be able to pick up that phone call, ya dig? \n\nIt's not about what she didn't do, that's why saying it's not her fault is besides the point. The point is, how are we going to prevent this from happening again. Showing her those options, will allow her to see how she could have acted differently without feeling shameful, or guilty. Maybe she'll be a little embarrassed she didn't think of these things initially, and she should. Not all negative emotions are bad or should be avoided. Daughter *has* to learn how to feel negative emotions without identifying with them. To admit you made a mistake and keep it moving. This is a major learning opportunity for her. She has to understand as a young woman, and as someone consuming alcohol, that behavior can't happen again. For her own sake, and her friends. That she's not a bad person, but she made a mistake. And that's okay. \n\nFWIW: My mom would defo make me apologize to my friends parents for the stress her and my night out caused and explain that it will not happen again. (Again, no fault admitted.

Their daughter was drunk and instead of getting into a car with a random (most likely drunk) person, or getting into a taxi and having lord knows what happen she called someone she knew would help. \nMy single dad had this same policy with me growing up, we knew we were allowed to call dad at anytime and dad would come get us.

You seem like a very cool and understanding father and it is great that you gave your daughter to talk about safety of being around drinks and such but I believe you should inform your daughter to be careful of her friend in case she gets into any trouble that will lead to your family.
