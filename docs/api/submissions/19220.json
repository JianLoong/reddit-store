All well and fun. I make sure my daughter knows what the risks are of drinking and going out and she doesn't party too hard. I let her know she can always call me if she needs to and I'll pick them up under any circumstance. The same goes for all of her friends and I make sure they at least have my contact in their phone. \n\nHowever her best friend is a different story. I don't think she was ever given the talk about what's safe to do and she regularly overdoes it. I see this when Kelsey brings Keira to my house and she is very drunk. Usually I'll get her a bottle of water, any snacks to sober up and we send her back home to her parents to deal with the consequences. \n\nHowever, this time my daughter lost Keira in the club. I'm not sure how, usually they're attached by the hip but my daughter let me know she could not find her. My daughter left the club and came home without Keira (i've talked to her about this). Keira called me about half an hour later, saying her battery died but found someone with a charger.  Immediately I left to pick her up. It was quite late and she's sobered up somewhat on the drive so I took her straight home. \n\nToday, Keira's parents informed me that they no longer felt comfortable allowing her to be at my house. They did not realise she had my number and felt it was of predatory nature that I, a single dad, was alone with her whilst she had been drinking and took her home. That they did not know why I was alone with her at all and Kelsey should have been with us. \n\nI explained that my daughter was separated from her and came home. Because she was still drunk, I let her recover at home whilst I dropped their daughter off to them. I reassured them nothing happened and that the most important thing to me was making sure Keira got home safely and was not taken advantage of in a taxi or by someone in the club. \n\nThey are sending all kinds of messages to my ex-wife about me being a predator which she sent to me. I just wanted to be sure both girls were home safe.

If I were you i'd block the parents and move on.\n\nNTA.", "Wow. Terrible parents blaming someone else for picking up the slack. DECIDEDLY NTA. And I am so sorry that they're slandering your character this way.", "NTA \n\nThank you fot bring a good person. Thank you for looking out for your daughter's friend. Thank you for going out of your way to insure that she arrived home safely.\n\nIt's pretty common for kids and young people to have their friends parents' contact info saved in their phone, regardless of gender. There's nothing nepharious or creepy about it.\n\nAgain, thank you.", "NTA. Unless you reversed Kiera's age and she's 12 her parents don't get a say about who drives her anywhere or who's house she goes to. These are not girls, these are women who get to decide who they are comfortable being around. They have no right to forbid their daughter from doing anything outside of their home at this point.", "NTA at all. You were doing a good thing for her. Maybe you should've brought your daughter along for the ride (just to be sure that there's not any accusations of anything), but when I've gotten that drunk, I'm not really interested in hopping right back in a car again either. \n\nAlso the girl is 22. What are her parents going to do? Ground her? They should be happy that you were there for her and it's damning that she called you over them.", "NTA- Tell her parents they can be responsible parents for Keira and teach her the dangers associated with consuming alcohol before something bad actually does happen to their daughter. I'd also include telling them that any sane parent would have made sure their legal to drink adult daughter shouldn't feel uncomfortable calling her parents to come pick her up from the club, and that you will continue to do the right thing by your daughter and her friends because it will keep them out of harms way, and allow them to experience this aspect of life in a safe way.", "No way man you are not the asshole \n\nYou did a really nice thing. \n\nI GUESS I can see how someone might be uncomfortable with a man they don\u2019t know so well being alone with their very drunk daughter BUT you still went out of your way to get her home safe \n\nIn retrospect, maybe it\u2019s safer for you to just bring your daughter with you as long as she isn\u2019t getting sick or anything \n\nHonestly that girl needs to grow up and handle her shit. And she and your daughter need to stick together if they are out\n\nRealistically she should have called her own parents. I think she is afraid of getting in trouble or something which is why she called you", "Obviously NTA and it sucks that these parents are making such a shitty assumption about your motives.", "NTA. I understand the other parents' concern, but she was drunk and lost at a club. Would Keira's parents rather her be picked up by some random person and never returned home?\n\nThat said, INFO. Did you let the parents know you picked her up? If you didn't, I can see why they'd be uncomfortable.", "For your own good, maybe don\u2019t ever be alone with Keira. Her parents sound deranged and in denial.\n\nYou are a saint for going and rescuing Keira\u2019s drunk, (of legal age),  butt. Her parents should be *thanking* you. \n\nYea, being accused of being a predator is the thanks you get. No good deed\u2026 as the saying goes :(  And you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nKiera's parents should be thanking you for taking care of their intoxicated daughter.  \n\nGoing forward, have Kiera's parents be responsible for her. It's easy to make comments and blame others when you (Kiera's parents) have no responsibility tied to the situation.", "NTA. Tell her parents to be parents and not useless wastes of oxygen and tissue.", "Nta", "NTA-  my Dad did the same thing.  Picked up, no questions asked of any of our friends because their parents wouldnt!   I think the parents of the other girl are just acting out because their own daughter will not call them for help. (which speaks volumes).", "NTA and THANK YOU from a previous-dumb-and-drunken-21-yo-girl for keeping her safe.", "NTA\n\nIt seems like you have just discovered the deflective parents. They are so shitty that their daughter would rather call someone else than them when she needs to get home - but instead of reflecting on that they decide to call another human a predator.\n\nThey are fucking insane. The mental leaps these dumb fuck jump through to go from 'person wants to help' to 'person must be a predator' defy logic.\n\nUnfortunatly you will have to rescind your offer to Keira to give her a lift home in future, but make damn sure you tell her exactly why. \n\nThe alternative is rig up cctv in your car and carry on regardless - so when those knucke draggers call the cops (and they will) you can throw that back in their face.", "NTA! Sir, you are a good man.", "NTA.  Block their number.", "NTA. I\u2019d watch out that Keira\u2019s father isn\u2019t interested in your daughter, though, bc that\u2019s some high-grade projection", "NTA. And I hate that we live in a world where that's their first thought. You were making sure their daughter got home safely.", "NTA, but there are multiple layers to this.\n\nKiera is her own adult. But she lives with her parents. Their house, their rules. If they are not comfortable with it, try to respect their wishes (You should plainly let Kiera that that's her parents' wishes). If she lived on her own it's a different story.", "ESH\n\nShould've brought your daughter along. It was kinda her responsibility to see that Kiera got home safe anyway. Probably should've also called her folks instead of doing it yourself. You'd be waking them up bringing their daughter home anyway, might as well give them a call. I get the \"I'll do it myself\" dad-vibe but there's no good reason you couldn't have done either of those things which would've changed the situation entirely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, saying she shouldn't be with you guys at all is a big overreaction. Would make sense if they said something like \"let's not have this ever happen again; next time Kiera is out drunk you call us and we'll pick her up\".", "NTA, god knows what would've happened with the person she got the charger from", "Fuck them, if that girl parents had done their job they'd have been the one picking her up, not you.  \n\n\nTell them that you won't take her of that shit anymore, and the day that poor girl wil have a terrible accident cause no one is helping educating her torugh this it will be their problem not yours. Oh and don't forget to add that you'll sue them if you ever hear them calling you a predator again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's another to take a breezy, supportive, no-big-deal attitude when it's clear your child is drinking with someone who overdoes it routinely. Time to be a real dad.", "NTA.\n\n\"Your daughter is a young woman who was drunk and in a dangerous situation. She called me to ask me to come pick her up. I agreed to her request. Now, I understand you have begun a campaign of gossip and rumor against me, alleging that I am some sort of predator who behaved inappropriately in picking up your daughter when she called me drunk and asked me to give her a ride home. I believe the word \"predator\" was used. This is not simply outrageous and ridiculous, it is legally defamatory and actionable. If you do not stop this immediately, and you damage my reputation with your lies, I will pursue a defamation lawsuit against you. You are an ungrateful pair of parents, and you should ask yourselves why your daughter isn't calling the two of you when she is in a dangerous situation and needs a ride.\"", "She still lives with her parents so I feel like they have some say to an extent.
