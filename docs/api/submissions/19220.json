All well and fun. I make sure my daughter knows what the risks are of drinking and going out and she doesn't party too hard. I let her know she can always call me if she needs to and I'll pick them up under any circumstance. The same goes for all of her friends and I make sure they at least have my contact in their phone. \n\nHowever her best friend is a different story. I don't think she was ever given the talk about what's safe to do and she regularly overdoes it. I see this when Kelsey brings Keira to my house and she is very drunk. Usually I'll get her a bottle of water, any snacks to sober up and we send her back home to her parents to deal with the consequences. \n\nHowever, this time my daughter lost Keira in the club. I'm not sure how, usually they're attached by the hip but my daughter let me know she could not find her. My daughter left the club and came home without Keira (i've talked to her about this). Keira called me about half an hour later, saying her battery died but found someone with a charger.  Immediately I left to pick her up. It was quite late and she's sobered up somewhat on the drive so I took her straight home. \n\nToday, Keira's parents informed me that they no longer felt comfortable allowing her to be at my house. They did not realise she had my number and felt it was of predatory nature that I, a single dad, was alone with her whilst she had been drinking and took her home. That they did not know why I was alone with her at all and Kelsey should have been with us. \n\nI explained that my daughter was separated from her and came home. Because she was still drunk, I let her recover at home whilst I dropped their daughter off to them. I reassured them nothing happened and that the most important thing to me was making sure Keira got home safely and was not taken advantage of in a taxi or by someone in the club. \n\nThey are sending all kinds of messages to my ex-wife about me being a predator which she sent to me. I just wanted to be sure both girls were home safe.

If you do not stop this immediately, and you damage my reputation with your lies, I will pursue a defamation lawsuit against you.

It\u2019s not unheard of for assault to happen with Uber drivers or other club patrons so that is a valid concern with a single drunk woman. Sure, there are incidents between the parent and the babysitter or the parent and their child\u2019s friend but you can\u2019t live life assuming that everyone is like that. And married parents are no more safe than unmarried parents when it comes to what could go wrong and it\u2019s no longer the 1800s when young  women need a chaperone to be around single men. These parents need to make decisions based on whether or not *she* trusts you and not how they think the optics of the situation look.", "NTA.

If they're that evil, they may try to pin something on you claiming Keira was too drunk to remember whatever they want to accuse you of.", "It seems like you should have just directly called her parents and let them deal with their drunk daughter if this is what you get for watching out.

They should be thankful that she contacted a trustworthy person to help her out.", "This is shitty so here goes. Stop picking her up. Call her parents and tell them when she calls.

I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s nuts. The parents clearly see the world through a certain lens, but it\u2019s not logical or normal and I don\u2019t think you should bow to it. SHE felt comfortable calling you, and that\u2019s what matters. Not her parents, regardless of whether she lives at home. \n\nI also think it would be doing Keira a real solid if you found a way to gently communicate to her that her parents\u2019 level of involvement in her life (they called this man to tell them they don\u2019t feel comfortable ALLOWING her at his home??) is abnormal and developmentally inappropriate. This girl has been done a huge disservice by her parents in that they haven\u2019t prepared her to be an independent adult, capable of handling herself re: alcohol, and I highly doubt that\u2019s the only way they\u2019ve f-ed her over with their controlling mentality. As someone who came from an extremely restrictive environment and had to figure out a lot of \u201creal life\u201d stuff on my own, I can tell you that help would be invaluable.", "Ok your not the Ah here I mean your daughter went with her friend and they drank which they should have done was be responsible and use the buddy system . I can see your the more responsible adult in this situation because this just goes to show that if your daughter was in the same position as Kiera I doubt they would even bat an eye and they would leave an innocent girl alone and what could possibly go wrong a lot of things . So I would flat say nope they are the ah if they don\u2019t even care about their drunk daughter who could possibly be taken a advantage of and it\u2019s because of them", "NTA. You are a good dad and the fact that your daughter's friends feel comfortable enough to come for you for help says a lot about your character. \n\nNo good deed goes unpunished.", "Welp.  From now on everytime you get called to pick them up, you call her parents to pick her up.  Only pick your kid from now on.  \n\nI would likely stay in the area to make sure she doesn't get left alone, but don't be in a car with her anymore.  \n\nNTA\n\nYou did a good thing, which is why you'll be punished by those that don't appreciate it.", "NTA and you've been a safe haven for their wildly inappropriate daughter. Kudos to you, dad.

Didn't need this evidence, of course but he always made sure to cover his bases.", "My dad was a middle school teacher and a coach. One day I was back home on break and he calls to say he's coming to pick me up to drive a student home. They came back from a meet after the buses were done and she hadn't arranged a ride. So, he called to make sure i was home but also for the time stamp to prove that exactly 10 minutes later I was with them in the car driving her home. Didn't need this evidence, of course but he always made sure to cover his bases.", "Yes I see how this can come across but honestly, I do not see Keira's parents' slander going anywhere as I am on great terms with the rest of her friends' parents. We do know eachother and have since Kelsey was in highschool. They are not strangers to me but I will be careful about this. CCTV seems like a good way to go, thankyou", "Yes I know, I have just seen so many stories about young women getting taken advantage of and it happened to one of my cousins also so it's something I've been weary of as my daughter has grown into legal age. I would never want to put her or any of her friends in that situation when I am sat at home and have the time to make sure they are home safely", "They are yes. That is along the lines of what I think will happen. It would be nice to be wrong but I don't think I am about this", "Yep. She left her friend at the club, she should be along for the ride. If this becomes routine behaviour for Keira\u2026 your daughter is not a babysitter, and I would advise daughter to discontinue going to clubs with her.\n\nSince it seems to be a one time fluke\u2026 y\u2019all did good.", "Yeah. It's not the kind of thing I would spend excessive amount of time stressing about, but there are some basic precautions worth taking even if the likelihood of a bad outcome is extremely unlikely.\n\nJust spend the extra few moments buckling the seatbelt.", "Worry about your own daughter, man. As I said, it's nice that you're concerned for her friends' safety, but not at the risk of being accused of being a sexual predator.\n\nBad things CAN happen. Anywhere, and to anyone. But more times than not, Uber is a safe option.", "I hope so too and you did a great job..... Also,try to send them a message along the lines of \"if you don't stop spreading rumours and gossip that I'm a predator,I'll have to sue you for defamation\"\n\nHave a nice day btw", "Yes this was an accident. They know to never leave eachother behind as I've told them what can happen and it's the safest way, especially for two girls on their own", "Honestly, it's time to tell the girls how much fun a chick flick and a couple bottles of wine can be. \n\nI overdid it in bars a few times too (in my 20s and, more regrettably, later on, too), but getting this wasted isn't a habit anyone ought to be forming.", "I'm sure they'll figure that out on their own, this is just what they like doing at the minute"]}
