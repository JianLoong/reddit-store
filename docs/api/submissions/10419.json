That was quickly taken advantage of and for the rest of my childhood and teen years I was fully expected to help out. Both my siblings are older. My sister was a bit higher functioning but it was still obvious to tell. My brother is low functioning and non verbal. Taking care of them was up to me. Wanna go out with friends? Can\u2019t. You need to watch your older siblings while I\u2019m out. Gotta do homework? Nope you need to help your sister with this PowerPoint project. That dog you finally got that you\u2019ve been asking to have for years? You\u2019ll hear us complain about him every second cause your brother starts fights with him. Want to enjoy the family vacation? You gotta bring your brother along and hold his hand. Anytime we were out I was in charge of chasing my brother whenever he ran off, and was then yelled at for losing him. My dad would try forcing me to let my sister hang out with me and my friends. She was over dramatic and attention seeking which always made things awkward. My mom gave her extra attention, claiming she did it so that I would have less on my plate when she was gone, but she said this while still saying I needed to take them in when I moved out and finished college.\n\n\n My sister recently passed away this last December and I guess in some way my brother understands somethings wrong. His outburst have gotten worse and it\u2019s made him unbearable to be around. My parents can barley control him but have made it clear they still want me to take care of him. I can honestly say I have lost all care for him. I can go as far to say I hate him. My childhood is gone and I can\u2019t help but blame him and my sister. But it\u2019s more my parents fault then theirs so I resent them too. My parents are outraged by my obvious resentment to him and try to force me to be affectionate with him and spend time with him. They excuse every time he hides or breaks my things and say he\u2019d behave better if I acted like I love him. l have made it clear I have no desire to take care of him or even keep him in my life. They\u2019re furious and refuse to do more than make small talk with me when the topics brought up again. My friends and my girlfriend are supportive but most my family thinks I\u2019m being too harsh. Part of me feels guilty since it\u2019s not like they asked to have kids with special needs but it also shouldn\u2019t be my burden. I also feel guilty for hating my brother but being happy and okay with spending time with my friends who have special needs.

Your brother, poor soul, has no fault and I understand feelings are irrational and it\u2019s normal to resent him, but he did not do anything wrong.\n\nI strongly advise you to go to therapy, probably include your parents too in some sessions. You need to let out your feelings in a healthy way and your parents need to understand you are not a co parent for them, you are also their child.\n\nI am very sorry for your loss and your current situation, I hope everything gets better.

Having a big brither who functions as a 2 yeard is a lot different then a brother who is devlopmentally 10 then maybe they can be held somewhat responsible) but you absolutely should not have had to care for him and I really don't blame you for feeling the way you do.   \n\nYou should have been taken care of and loved by your parents not a primary caregiver.", "I'm sorry you lost your childhood to special needs siblings.

I'm really sorry about your sister, and I'm so so sorry about losing lot of your childhood. Luckily adults can have a lot of restorative experiences. Don't do stupid things, but do things that fill you up and make you feel genuinely happy.\n\nYou're not wrong for your feelings. It feels bad to hate, or confusing to have mixed emotions, but as long as you're not being cruel to your brother, it is okay to feel how you feel. It is completely understandable. You may need to go low contact with your fam to create some space to heal. But, regardless, go to a therapist. Look for one that has experience working with families like yours, if possible. This will help you process and grieve and perhaps even facilitate some sessions with your parents where you can share your emotions.  Don't expect them to get it though.", "You are NTA! Your parents have failed to parent. Taking care of your siblings should never have been your responsibility. I am so sorry this has been your life. I don't know if you can sit down with them and explain gently that you are finished, and he is THEIR child, not yours. If they won't listen, you're going to have to abandon ship because you deserve to live your own life. That doesn't make you selfish or evil. He's not your child. Good luck.", "NTA. so i'm disabled and autistic myself. i can't totally speak for your brother because i am speaking and able to partially take care of myself, however i do have some experience both taking care of other disabled people *and* being taken care of. and here's my thought process on why you're NTA:\n\nit's absolutely 100% best and healthiest for both you *and* your brother for you to not be his caretaker if you resent him and have so much trauma associated with him.\n\ni often see fellow disabled people say \"if you aren't ready for the possibility of a disabled child, don't have kids\" and i agree. your parents didn't know your siblings would be disabled but when they chose to have kids, they had to have known that was a possibility. it's different with you because you were just born into this mess of a bad parenting situation. your siblings deserved to have adequate care that was not a child even younger than themselves, and you deserved to have a childhood. you and your parents' level of responsibility in this is not equivalent, period.\n\ni don't think you need to feel bad for resenting your brother but caring about your friends who have disabilities, because disabled people aren't a monolith. like, i bet your disabled friends aren't regularly violent and don't break your shit, no wonder you're cool with them but not him. it would be different if you were like \"i hate him for being disabled\" but it sounds like you resent him for the way he's treated you and for the way you were forced to take care of him at your own expense, which is just normal human feelings on your part. also, you aren't held responsible for your friends' behavior and won't be abused/neglected for their sake, so you're free to connect with them on your own terms and on a genuine human level. you've never had that freedom with your brother. of course it's not your brother's fault that your parents were such assholes and you have so many bad memories associated with him, but it's completely understandable for that relationship to be permanently tainted to you.\n\nlastly, i can't help but think your parents and relatives are coming down on you so hard because they're hoping you'll take care of your brother so they don't have to. it sounds like nobody involved (including and especially your parents) is able to handle your brother's behavior and meet his needs, and maybe your brother should be in a facility where they DO have the capacity to take care of him the way he sorely needs.\n\nstay strong dude, you've done nothing wrong here and imo your only obligation is to your own peace <3", "NTA. Your parents are the AHs here.  Don't discuss it with your parents anymore", "YTA to the extent that if you hated my son I wouldn't even make small talk with you or anything else. I'd also be outraged by your obvious resentment of him. What do you expect??", "I totally agree wth going to FAMILY therapy.  I can guarantee you, the therapist will be in your corner on this. And perhaps if they hear from the professional therapist (and an \"adult\"), that they are in the wrong, they will finally \"get it\" and they will stop beings AHs. But you are very much NTA!", "Really considering it but I\u2019m afraid of running into financial struggles and getting no support so I don\u2019t really know what to do", "Came here to say exactly this. OP is absolutely NTA.\nAnd if I may add to both seraphimburns' and Verrigation Sensation's suggestions: Have you ever considered a gap year in form of work-travel in Europe (assuming you're US-based) before starting college? Europe is safe to travel and has currently lots of work opportunities to offer. Minimum wage in my country is 12 \u20ac/h. You'd be too far away for your parents to follow you and you'd provide them with an unique and long overdue learning opportunity - i.e, learning how to care for their own child on their own as is their effing duty as parents.", "My father didn\u2019t want him to rely on devices growing up so it backfired severely and he has little to no communication skills. When I was younger I myself taught him basic things like to ask for stuff he wanted and say he\u2019s hungry but that\u2019s the best kid me could do.

Why are you just downvoting me for jokes? Lmao", "They have made concerning jokes about not letting me \u201crun away\u201d even if I tried which is unsettling. College might be the best bet. Already planned to go but might just end up having to live in the dorms.", "I am not....", "Living in the dorms, even for just your first year may be a good bet. Much more secure and with more rules than a regular apartment. \n\nThere is a great deal of support available for your brother. So he can be happier and more independent, especially after your parents are no longer here to look after him. If you leaving helps your brother get the get help he actually needs, will be the best thing for him in the long run. I work for an agency that provides care of people, some of whom are probably like  your brother. Day programs.  Group homes. Respite support.  There are options, but many of our clients come from terrible situations. It takes years to help get them settled and learning the life skills they need to be comfortable. But they can live happy lives, with agency about how they live appropriate to their abilities and understanding. \n\nUnfortunately, it's easier for your parents to make you the caregiver. Than to seek a real solution. And admit their son needs more care than they can provide. \n\nRun far away! They will figure it out, but only if they think they can't dump it all on you.", "That's called unlawful imprisonment.

Despite what the post says a part of me does still worry about him and what his future holds since at the end of the day I know he\u2019s done nothing wrong. I hope he is taken care of and properly loved wherever he ends up. It\u2019s a struggle between wanting to get away and wanting to make sure he\u2019s safe before I do but then resenting him. Complicated emotions but these replies and support have been a big help. Thank you.", "This!", "A compromise to yourself then could be that when you're older and more financially stable is to look at group homes for people like your brother. Eventually your parents will die and probably leave all his care onto you expecting you to house and care for him like you do now. Unless you are willing to do that again being prepared with a place to send him that will care for him and you can keep an eye on him from a distance.", "> They have made concerning jokes about not letting me \u201crun away\u201d even if I tried which is unsettling.\n\nOnce your 18.
