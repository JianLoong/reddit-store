You tell your teenage son that dad is the bad guy because he expects him to show up for something you two pay for?  Don\u2019t have adult conversations with kids and never put down the other parent. Dad is teaching responsibility. You are making excuses for bad behavior from your son.", "I'm stuck between YTA and ESH. It depends on a few things. How did you say it? Was it hurled as insult or a gentle reminder of how he felt about being treated that way? Also, what activity and why can't your son go? Are you spending money on a pastime that your son just doesn't want to be involved in?", "Not enouh context and information to make an informed decision - very one sided.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Why should he continue to pay for an extra curricular that your son wont go to?

It's common sense. \n\nInstead seeing his perfectly normal view, you lashed out and shamed him with the one thing that would get to him like that. Then instead of recognizing your son's just going to side with who spoils him most, you enabled bringing him into a marital problem. \n\nThere's a big difference in giving a teenager freedom to grow and just letting them do whatever they want.

If your really concerned about the kids well being and connection to his father maybe get something actually useful like family therapy, instead of you driving a wedge between everyone.", "NTA well it was true, and the truth often needs to be pointed out to the people in denial.\n\nCould you have been more diplomatic? Sure.\n\nBut he could also have been a better father and not taken his issues out on his kid.", "YTA\n\nTeenagers need to take responsibilities, if your kid kept skipping extracurricular activities it's important to have a conversation with him about it.\n\nWhat you did is trying to paint yourself as the cool mom and his dad a bad guy. \n\nAlienating the other parent is the worst thing that you could do.", "YTA for bringing your 13yo kid into the argument. It's hard to judge the rest without specifics, but if your kid isn't attending a class I don't see why it should be paid for anyway. But if you and your husband are raising your kid differently you really need to get on the same page (and not use your kid as a way to 2:1 disagreements, Jesus)", "\n\nNTA. You have every right to express your opinion and it's entirely normal to disagree with your husband about parenting. You\u2019ve communicated your point of view in a respectful way, and you haven\u2019t done anything wrong. It\u2019s understandable that you want to protect your son from the same treatment your husband experienced in his childhood, and you should be proud that you\u2019ve managed to do it so far. You can try to talk to him more about it in a peaceful environment and tell him your feelings, so that he can understand your point of view.", "YTA - for bringing your kid into the argument and for using low blows in your disagreement with your husband.\n\nStopping paying for an extracurricular that your son has not been attending is not unreasonable. It doesn't even need to be framed as a punishment just that now isn't the time for it for X, Y, Z reasons and you're putting it on pause.\n\nIt would probably be helpful for you and your husband to do some marital counseling to help you both communicate and get on the same page regarding parenting.", "YTA. have you ever thought if you are the one putting distance between your son and husband? i'm assuming this isn't the first time you have turned your son against your husband.", "Slightly YTA\n\nName calling/insulting/whatever, even in the heat of an argument, just isn't the way to go.  You didn't say it because you're trying to help him see how his behavior affects his son, you really said it to drive home a point/insult.\n\nNone of your examples seem to demonstrate your husband is overly strict.  Saying you won't pay for an activity a kid is not going to hardly seems draconian to me.  I'm sure there's more context, but kids need reasonably strict parents.  My wife is great, but too soft - I'm the disciplinarian.  Most families evolve to one parent being more of the authority figure.\n\nIf you told me your husband constantly smacked your son or \"grounded him for 2 weeks\", I might have a different opinion.

Probably not. But at the end of the day, the dad didn't call the kid over and bring him into it. The dad opted for the brutally honest route when the son asked what they were arguing about. \n\nI fully expect to get downvoted into oblivion for this statement, but I do offer an explanation:\n\nYou've told multiple people that the father brought the kid into it and defended the mom when people have suggested she brought the kid into it. No one brought the kid into it, he asked what was happening and they told him.\n\nIf that conversation was loud enough to be heard by the son and the son became curious or concerned enough to ask, then it probably shouldn't have happened when the son was home. \n\nAnd, as I have experienced between my parents as a kid, it's entirely possible that OP words \"disappointing news\" to the son in a way that makes it seem like she isn't to blame, making dad look like the bad guy every time. So his decision to instruct OP to be up front with the son on the spot may have been his way of trying to get a first hand reaction from his son, rather than allowing OP time to think of a nice way to say it and ultimately make him look bad. Not saying that's what OP is doing or that, if she is, she's doing it on purpose. My mom (my \"fun\" parent) didn't want to ruin that bond she had with me, so the way she told me something bad usually made it seem like my dad was to blame for the decision. \n\nI understand that this imbalanced parental power dynamic does a lot more damage to the child in the long run - but just saying that a commenter should consider their verdict because \"the dad brought the kid into it\" isn't constructive.", "So why didn't the father got his son to sit down and told him look  the activity is a waste of money. \n\nAre you going to attend it cause if not and you Skip it again with no good reason I'm not gonna pay for it anymore. \n\nProblem solved. \n\nThe boy is warned and next time he can cancel/not pay the activity anymore.\n\nI personally am leaning towards n t a as is,  cause op said the son didn't attend due to reasons,  not that he wasn't in the mood to attend and skipped - there could be good reasons not to attend. \n\nAlso the father involving the son in this discussion makes him directly the ah imo", "It's rare for there not to be an actual reason.
