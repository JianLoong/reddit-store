He said in MY BED.\n\nI thought about it and don't want to get him cookies. If I let him eat them in his bed, then my younger two will want the same. That's not why I do it.

I would maybe suggest give him the cookies, let him be, and try spending some time with him doing what he likes instead and enjoy the cuddle time with the smaller ones. Change is hard, But kids grow older and find this kind of idea Lame. (I Think it is a super tradition). You Will just create distance over some cookies.

Food is not for emotional manipulation or for control.\n\nAlso, is no one else concerned about OP ingesting a BOX of hostess cupcakes in one sitting? Isn't that like,  10?

I'll have a box of Hostess cupcakes, my younger two boys will share some Ben and Jerry's and my 12yo will have a couple of jumbo chocolate chip cookies. \n\nLately my 12yo has been cold to the idea of our tradition. I understand that he'd rather he in his room by himself and do thinks that I did when I was his age. I'm going grocery shopping tomorrow morning and my kids reminded me to get their deserts. My 12yo asked me to get the jumbo cookies with M&Ms instead of chocolate chips. I asked if he was going to hangout with me in my room and he gave a staunch \"nope.\"\n\nI asked him why and he said he didn't want to anymore. I said so where is he going to eat his cookies. He said in MY BED.\n\nI thought about it and don't want to get him cookies. If I let him eat them in his bed, then my younger two will want the same. That's not why I do it. I do it to spend fun silly close time with them. So I'm thinking of making it a rule that you have to have Friday Night desert in daddy's bed.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You cannot force your kids to want to be with you or into keeping traditions. I have a 15 year old who, when she was younger, was ok with chilling with my on my bed and with tickle fights and hugs.

I also like watching YouTube and playing video games (we mostly don't agree on music), so I have joined her on one of her online games and sometimes we play together and watch YouTube videos about it. Things change and you can change with them. I even got a giant U sectional couch for the living room so everyone in my household had a section of couch to call their own and could lay down and snuggle with their own blanket. We can watch TV or play games, but all be in the same room together, but not be on top of each other. We all like horror stuff and lets plays, so if I'm watching something she might like I ask if she wants to join. Or we watch something she wants to watch. It's a give and take.

His reasoning doesn't have to make sense- you just have to respect he would rather do something else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said it before and I will reiterate: Forcing him to spend time with you will only push him away. You have to meet him at his own level. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy don't you ask him if there's another activity he'd prefer to do with you? Or maybe he just needs some space- which is healthy for a kid his age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're clinging so tightly to the idea of the child you have/want rather than the one in front of you.

Just because a kid wants to do one thing and a parent wants them do something else doesn't make it automatically parental selfishness. Sure, maybe a 12 year old would always rather play video games than do any family activities, but that doesn't make a parent selfish for trying to get the kid to take part. I'm not necessarily saying this dad is right in every way about how he's going about it, but the main point is he wants to share close time with his sons, and that's sweet, and wanting to do it even though his kids might prefer to hide in their rooms and play minecraft or whatever doesn't automatically make him selfish.", "No one is stopping him from going to his room", "Thank you all for calling this out.

The bonding time should be something they all enjoy and if once a week seems like too much, they can move it to once a month and then do small things individually together throughout the weeks. If the kids would rather be by themselves than with their parent, their parent isn\u2019t doing their job in bonding and connecting to their kids. I spent most of my time outside but I liked going to the store with my mom or Mario kart after cleaning, building things or playing card games with my dad, and as I grew up those activities changed based on interests. If the kids like video games and Minecraft, the solution is to play video games and Minecraft with them, ask about their interests and invest your time towards learning about them. All it takes is 1 activity per kid, or 1 joint activity for all of them that they all like for the kids to enjoy the activity and want to spend time together. Forced family time does not make families stronger, instead you should be working towards making your kids want to spend time with the family whether it be watching tv, playing games,going on trips or whatever. When you invest in your kids and their interests, they won\u2019t want to hide away from you and if your kid is hiding away from the family, they either need to talk to someone or there is some kind of issue in the ways of parenting that needs to be addressed.", "We aren't discussing generalities, though.

He means well and his intentions are great. He's just pushing a little hard...which I think is normal. For kids to pull away at adolescence and for parents to push harder because they miss that closeness. It's a tough time, with a lot of negotiating.
