He said in MY BED.\n\nI thought about it and don't want to get him cookies. If I let him eat them in his bed, then my younger two will want the same. That's not why I do it.

I would maybe suggest give him the cookies, let him be, and try spending some time with him doing what he likes instead and enjoy the cuddle time with the smaller ones. Change is hard, But kids grow older and find this kind of idea Lame. (I Think it is a super tradition). You Will just create distance over some cookies.

And you are creepy AF as well. At 12 most kids don't necessarily want snuggle time with daddy in bed. You insisting that he only gets desert if he does this creepy thing is, well, creepy.

Food is not for emotional manipulation or for control.\n\nAlso, is no one else concerned about OP ingesting a BOX of hostess cupcakes in one sitting? Isn't that like,  10?

I'll have a box of Hostess cupcakes, my younger two boys will share some Ben and Jerry's and my 12yo will have a couple of jumbo chocolate chip cookies. \n\nLately my 12yo has been cold to the idea of our tradition. I understand that he'd rather he in his room by himself and do thinks that I did when I was his age. I'm going grocery shopping tomorrow morning and my kids reminded me to get their deserts. My 12yo asked me to get the jumbo cookies with M&Ms instead of chocolate chips. I asked if he was going to hangout with me in my room and he gave a staunch \"nope.\"\n\nI asked him why and he said he didn't want to anymore. I said so where is he going to eat his cookies. He said in MY BED.\n\nI thought about it and don't want to get him cookies. If I let him eat them in his bed, then my younger two will want the same. That's not why I do it. I do it to spend fun silly close time with them. So I'm thinking of making it a rule that you have to have Friday Night desert in daddy's bed.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You cannot force your kids to want to be with you or into keeping traditions. I have a 15 year old who, when she was younger, was ok with chilling with my on my bed and with tickle fights and hugs.

I also like watching YouTube and playing video games (we mostly don't agree on music), so I have joined her on one of her online games and sometimes we play together and watch YouTube videos about it. Things change and you can change with them. I even got a giant U sectional couch for the living room so everyone in my household had a section of couch to call their own and could lay down and snuggle with their own blanket. We can watch TV or play games, but all be in the same room together, but not be on top of each other. We all like horror stuff and lets plays, so if I'm watching something she might like I ask if she wants to join. Or we watch something she wants to watch. It's a give and take.

Hang out together on the couch either with just him,  and keep the same tradition with the little ones for now, or transition it to a different location for all three. Personally, I think spending time with your little ones first and then making special time for your older son for you to bond in a different way would be most beneficial. Denying him or forcing him to continue a tradition he is growing out of will only damage your relationship. However, if you offer him an appropriate compromise and he gives you attitude, no cookies.
