My then boyfriend, now husband, was low on TP while I was staying over for a week. He ran out to buy some more and came back with a two pack of standard rolls (as in tiny little rolls). I laughed and said we'd be out again by mid week and he said this lasted him nearly a month. \n\nWell once we ran out of TP by Wednesday he asked why I use so much so I told him women wipe when they pee and we pee about twice as often as men.
