I 28f hate my mom's bf. He is rude and gives me an unsettling vibe when he is around my daughters. I told my mom I don't care if she dates him but he is not welcome around my family. Well today she informs me that she invited him over for Thanksgiving to my house where I am hosting. I told her no way is he allowed in my house. She said that he is spending it alone and to have compassion I told her I don't care and if she is concerned then she should spend the day with him since she invited him without my consent.

Holidays are there to rest, if you can\u2019t do that with him in your home then he\u2019s not invited. You\u2019re the host, point. Your mother doesn\u2019t want to come? Fine. One less person to cook for xD happy holiday, spend it with your loved ones, OP."]}
