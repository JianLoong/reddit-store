However, it is within her right to decline the invite if her partner cannot come. That's her choice though.", "NTA \n\nYour mother chose her bf over you and your family, so she shouldn't come around either. If your kids are upset, explain to them why. Stick to your guns on this one.", "\u201cTrust your gut.\u201d That\u2019s it! Better to be too careful one time than not being careful enough. Holidays are there to rest, if you can\u2019t do that with him in your home then he\u2019s not invited. You\u2019re the host, point. Your mother doesn\u2019t want to come? Fine. One less person to cook for xD happy holiday, spend it with your loved ones, OP.", "Better to be rude/look foolish than for your kids be a victim. Alway trust your gut.", "NTA. Sorry you have drama in your family. It tends to get more dramatic over time. As a mom, your first duty is to protect your kids. I hope you can make something work out over time.", "NTA. Now that you\u2019re a parent yourself, your kids take precedence over your parents. Keeping them safe is more important than keeping your mom happy.  \nThe kids are upset \u2018cause they don\u2019t/can\u2019t understand your reasons, but that doesn\u2019t mean you made the wrong choice.", "YTA\n\nVibe is not enough to cause so much trouble. You have any evidence? Any observations that make him potentially dangerous?", "Take some minutes and really think about why this dude gives you bad vibes when it comes to your daughters.\n\nI bet subconsciously or even consciously you have received signs or patterns from him that make you realize that he is indeed a creep and once you can verbalize your feelings you can and should talk to your kids and warn them. You can teach them to recognize bad behavior and explain to them and maybe even your mother why this guy cannot be around them without them being unsafe.\n\nTrust your instincts.", "NTA \n\nTrust your gut and protect your kids. We always want to believe we won\u2019t be the ones that some traumatic or dark crap happens to (if you haven\u2019t already). If he even gives you a little bit of an off feeling around your kids AND is disrespectful in your home keep him away. Currently your mother is making a choice and she is choosing her boyfriend over her own kid and grandkids so that shows the character she has.", "NTA you\u2019re protecting your children from an unknown and possibly harmful person.

You are getting that feeling for a reason. Protect your children, they come before your mother.", "NTA. The old, be careful who you grant permission into your home, is taken waaaaay too lightly these days. If you get a bad vibe from him, go with your gut and don\u2019t allow him in your home. Mom can stop by before she spend the day with her boo(:", "NTA.  Your mother was already aware of your feelings and had no right inviting someone you do not like to your property.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that. Your mom is totally unreasonable and she\u2019s putting this awful man before her grandchildren and you.

Trust your mom instinct.", "I can't upvote this enough.  My mother was dating and considering marriage to an unsavory man. There was A LOT of very negative stuff in his background.  I told my mother that she was free to date and marry whoever she liked, but that man would not be welcome in our home, and we would not visit hers if he was there.  The most we would do is meet at a restaurant. \n\nMy sister got very upset with me and said that, while he had issues, she trusted our mom.  My response to that was that our mother trusted this man and she would have no problem running to the store leaving the children alone with him.  Turns out we shouldn't have trusted our mother because a bunch of additional stuff came out about the guy that my mother was well aware of.  The big stink I made about the guy was very unpopular at the time, but it put everyone on their guard and none of our children were harmed.  NTA", "I agree with this. OP could be the asshole here. Also, he might not be. Not enough info to tell.", "So better to let her kids be around Creepy Dave?"]}
