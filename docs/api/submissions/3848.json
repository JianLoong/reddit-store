When I say \"not being the best\" I don't mean she was directly or purposely harmful to me, she just had a lot of mental health issues that prevented her from being the most present parent. The most responsible and loving thing that she could do for me was give my dad (57m) primary custody and didn't fight the courts recommendation for supervised visits until I was a teen.\n\nWithout fail my mom always showed up to my birthdays, gave me presents and called me on holidays, and went to as much events as she could for me. While I was sad that my mom wasn't around all the time my parents always made sure I knew that it wasn't my fault and that my mom was just \"sick.\" I never really had an issue with that explanation until \"Tamara\" (30f) made fun of me for not having a mommy who loved me enough to want me. In her world when parents split up the mom always got the kids unless she didn't love them.\n\nThat's how it started in Elementary school and then Tamara started bullying me for other things. I used to come home crying multiple times and my dad went to the school with this issue repeatedly, but since none of the adults were around when Tamara's \"alleged\" bullying happened there wasn't much that was done. For the longest time my mom didn't know about any of this because dad feared that she would make it worse. However when my mom saw how visibly upset I was, I broke down and told her everything. My hair was the result of Tamara \"accidentally\" spilling a mix of glue and blue paint on top of my head.\n\nMy mom was very calm and comforting the whole time and asked me for Tamara's full time and any other description that I could give of her, her parents, and the type of car they drove. My dad eventually was able to get me over to another school and the following year my mom paid for me, my dad, and her to go to \"Mouse World\" in Florida. I never saw or heard from Tamara again until recently when she and I discovered that her boyfriend was living in the same apartment complex as me.\n\nTamara recognized me immediately and confronted me about how my mom and I \"ruined\" her life. I had no idea what she was talking about and Tamara told me that my mom had an affair with Tamara's dad and revealed it at Tamara's birthday party. I didn't believe her and just walked away, then when I told my mom about it she admitted to everything and even said that the money she used to pay for our family trip came from Tamara's dad. I was shocked.\n\nI did some digging and apparently Tamara's parents had a bitter divorce, were forced to sell the house, and to this day Tamara feels a certain level of dread around her birthday. My mom feel no remorse as, in her eyes, it was all Tamara's fault for being a bully in the first place. I definitely feel like my mom went way overboard despite understanding the \"why\" but am AITA for not giving an apology?  \n\n\nEdit to add: Because someone asked I'll try and clarify a few things  \n\n\n1. I don't know when the affair happened exactly. I only know what my mom volunteered in the single conversation we had about this and I'm almost positive I don't want to know anymore.\n2. My dad and primary custody and never told my mom so Tamara's parent never met my mom or knew what she looked like.\n3. My mom admitted to using the information I gave her to stalk Tamara's family before formulating a way to introduce herself to Tamara's dad. She said it took a few weeks before she was able to actually do anything with Tamara's dad and it last for a few months. \n4. My mom recorded one of her encountered with Tamara's dad and had it shown on to everyone at Tamara's birthday party. My mom admitted to doing this because she wanted Tamara to regret the day she was born. \n5. My mom ended the affair the day after Tamara's birthday but not before cashing the check her dad gave her.

Your parents divorced and managed not do destroy their child.

But I guess Tamara's mom did take Tamara in the divorce- so at least she felt loved- according to what she told OP in elementary school.

The problem is just that it is both myopic and short-sighted.\n\nSome children are definitely more cruel than others, but generally speaking bullying is a learned behavior. This kind of response uses bullying to block bullying and the guaranteed outcome is going to be more bullying.\n\nThat said, I definitely understand the perspective that you just want to make the pain for your child stop. That's legit. But if you stop that pain for your kid--even effectively--at the cost of pushing pain onto someone else (the kid coping with issues and probably being bullied at home, the future victims of that kid as they become an even worse bully, the potentially innocent mom who has her life fall apart as her husband cheats on her, etc.) then that is pretty messed up. Definitely not legendary behavior. \n\n*Plus*, at the end of the day, you can't be sure you're actually protecting your kid. The kid you intimidated could take the long revenge approach just like the OP's mom did here. And now the daughter is dealing with the mess--someone in her apartment complex who has a credible animosity toward her and a bitter enemy.

I guess Tamara\u2019s dad just didn\u2019t really love her.

I obviously don't think this is healthy behavior but we're in a room where people are calling OPs mom a legend for showing her sex tape at a kid's birthday party and you're offended by my anecdote?", "Nothing to apologize for. I know there are ideas about bullies having unhappy home lives. I don\u2019t know how statistically accurate they are, but I also don\u2019t begrudge bullies getting their own care. But I also don\u2019t begrudge them learning the hard way that bullying isn\u2019t an acceptable or profitable way to cope with being unhappy. \n\nI am also always hesitant to even suggest it is the responsibility of the bullied to care for their bullies. The narrative of bullies being victims themselves, and the people they bully needing to be the bigger/better person seem like a big component in how bullies continue to bully, and their victims often feel wholly unsupported. So, to me, in the context of this post, it should be unambiguous that Tamara was not the victim, OP was the victim of Tamara.
