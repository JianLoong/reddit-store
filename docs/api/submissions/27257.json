It sounds like it saved him (and you) from a lot of pain. A lesser of two evils situation.\nI hope he can eventually emotionally recover from what his family put him through.", ">but it ruins his day/week/month and he often reacts in very self-destructive ways\n\nThis for me makes you NTA ...\n\nYes it's bad you did that, it seems controlling but in the end you try to prevent him from hurting himself and probably saw no other real option. I get behind why you did that. The execution may not have been the best, but honestly I'm not able to coming up with a better solution because *he* is not taking actions to prevent that... and I wouldn't want to see my partner hurting so much either.", "Hi. I grew up with toxic parents and went no contact about 15 years ago. I have not blocked them, although limited the ways they can contact me (e.g. they have my phone number but not my e-mail and or other things I use to communicate with my friends nor do they know my social handles etc.). I too get such messages, and yes I also get upset.\n\nWhy do I not block them? The simplest explanation would be that somewhere deep down I still have a tiny glimpse of hope that one beautiful day, they have an epiphany or come to an actual realization. Even if that realization would be that I do indeed not wish to get messages from them, so looking forward to a new year's eve without one of these texts. Or wake up one birthday morning to a simple and not guilt-trippy best wishes message that just says \"happy birthday\". \n\nCan't say if your partner's reasons are the same as mine. Maybe it would be better to block them. Maybe not. Stuff for them to explore in therapy. \n\nHowever I would freak out if my partner would go and delete messages, even these ones, from my phone without my knowledge. I value my privacy, and I value being able to make my own decisions, because I'm still haunted and feel violated by how my parents infringed on these. My mom would hide messages from friends from me in order to manipulate me into thinking people don't like me anymore. Or she would go around telling relatives and friends that I did not like them anymore and they should stop contacting me. Parents would go through my private conversations. Parents would make unilateral decisions on my behalf all the time.\n\nAgain, can't say your partner feels violated in the same way. \n\nI know you want to protect your partner, but I don't think this is the way. I can see your intentions are good, but the road to hell is paved with these you know. I wouldn't call you can asshole for what you did, but you made a mistake and should try to resolve it. \n\nNTA but please please please talk to your partner about this, own up to what you did, discuss how to proceed, accept if they are mad, apologize accordingly, find a way to move forward. You are not an AH to be worried about your spouse, or for the fact you don't want to see them suffer. But maybe this isn't the way to help.", "I\u2019d say YTA but in a very justified, n.ta sort of way.

You aren't doing him any favors by delaying his ultimate rock bottom. \n\nWhy aren't you addressing this with him in between those messages?

YTA. \n\nI could see my wife doing this and me getting pretty upset. She\u2019s gotten text from my parents before and took days to tell me. It seems to be an invasion of privacy and a bit controlling. You didn\u2019t want it to ruin your day or send him spiraling. Do these texts activate you as well? \n\nGoing no contact with immediate family is not something you go lightly into and it\u2019s an extremely personal experience. The amount of grieving is intense and ongoing. When first going nc, I set boundaries with my parents, to see if they over step them. When they did, I could point it out and provide repercussions, like a restraining order. It also lets me know I did the right thing by going NC when I saw their ugly abusive messages.\n\nIt\u2019s his choice how, when and if he communicates with his family. He hasn\u2019t blocked them and maybe that\u2019s for a reason/emotional reason you\u2019re unaware of. That was my last step and it was the most painful thing I\u2019ve done.

I have my reasons for keeping them as Facebook friends though, and I completely limited them to that as their only way to contact me.\n\nWhile I don't truly ever expect them to change or to ever see them again, I guess there's some part of me that things possibly.

It\u2019s not fair to either of you and can\u2019t be good for your relationship.  I highly recommend finding a therapist who can help him.

He should be grown up enough to block them. If simply not getting these messages changes the outcome of the whole holiday than he should not be subjecting himself to them, but more importantly, he should not be subjecting you to his emotional abuse when he gets them. He\u2019s also harming you by making you dread holidays and special events, that should be fun, by opening himself, and by extension you, up to these messages and those people. \n\nHonestly, if I were you I\u2019d talk to him about how unfair it is to you that he doesn\u2019t block them.

Either way, you are a loving and protective spouse.", "NTA. I would say YTA if his day was also ruined by not getting the expected text, but it wasn\u2019t, he had a good day. Whether you bring it up now after the fact is up to you. You know your husband better than any of us do, so only you would know whether you going through his phone would upset him.  And since it sounds like you don\u2019t really talk about it, maybe it\u2019s a good time to bring it up. Not to force him one way or another or anything like that, but simply to gage where his head space is at with it.", "YTA \n\nSure you had good intentions. \n\nHe needs to block them. \n\nHe needs to make that decision. \n\nYou\u2019re not his Mum. He\u2019s an adult and has to work through these things.", "Well-meaning, but YTA. It is his NC journey. It is his choice not to block them and maybe he doesn't for various reasons you're not privy to. I understand that he gets upset and that it upsets YOU, but ultimately taking the choice away feels violating and could potentially lead to resentment. Be careful. Talk with your husband.", "Considering he is literally a danger to himself and others when he gets these messages, I would say you are definitely NTA.  I might be initially angry with my spouse but, ultimately, when he explained why, I think I would have been grateful in this position.  If my brother I am NC with somehow managed to message me through all the ways I have him blocked and my spouse saw it and deleted it, I would ultimately be thankful that I did not have to deal with him.", "YTA because it's simply not your decision to make. You may have been well intentioned but you've taken away his power in this situation. It's not up to you to navigate this for him. The only thing you should do is be there for him as he deals with it.", "Hopefully you emptied the \"bin\" as well.", "Gentle YTA. \n\nI know you had good intentions, but he's an adult, it's his journey with his parents, and it should be his choice, not for you to take it from him. \n\nI understand this is hard for you too when he responds in destructive ways. Maybe talk about that, ask him how you can best support him through these times, and explain the effect this has on you too.", "I agree with Figment in that this is an ESH. Though you had good intentions, it doesn\u2019t negate the power you took away from him. Taking away someone\u2019s choice (even if you think it is justified) is called controlling them.\n\nYour husband on the other hand is seriously putting you and others in danger. His emotional abuse after he goes into a spiral isn\u2019t ok. I think your husband doesnt realize how much of an impact this is having on you, OP. But his drinking and driving is COMPLETELY unacceptable. What would have happened if he got into an accident, hurt someone else? You\u2019re life would be forever changed. \n\nI think you talk to hubby and explain to him as Figment said how much his actions are affecting you.", "Soft ESH. \n\nYou have good intentions and you know that every text ruins his birthdays in the past. So you want him to have a good day. \n\nHowever, I do suggest you tell him what you did, when it\u2019s appropriate and not a special day and maybe part of his therapy sessions.

You should speak about this in therapy and possibly come clean in there. I\u2019m sure this is effecting your mental health as well and you need to talk this out.

It's time to talk that out and ask him the questions you are asking us. We can't really read his mind and it's HIS call on whether or not what you did was appreciated or too far. It's definitely not ours.", "NTA - part of being a couple is protecting each other.  \nThat is all you did", "NTA. I'm gonna go a little out the box here and say your husband is the AH. He went NC, his family still contacts, and it upsets him to a place of destructive behavior. HE needs to deal with the issues. He needs therapy. Going NC doesn't heal the depth of the wounds. It just eases the picking. You protecting him from his family (and you protecting yourself from his response to them) can't and shouldn't be your job.\n\nShould you have deleted the message? Normally, I'd say no, but if it's to stop your husband from drinking and driving due to the stress of a text, you were within rights to do so. You shouldn't have to monitor their communication or walk on eggshells. His family is still controlling him, and he needs therapy.", "NTA, I\u2019d have done the same thing tbh and the fact that he never asked about it or was like hmmm they didn\u2019t text me means to me that he doesn\u2019t want them to message him. He may not have blocked them holding out some hope they might reach out to apologize in the future but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for doing what you did if they sent some generic bs message. I hope therapy starts to help him move on\u2026", "NTA. As his spouse, I think you did the right thing.

He can still remain relationships with the extended family", "Maybe you should check in with him during a neutral time and ask if he\u2019d like you to proactively delete messages he receives during special occasions?", "NTA it\u2019s wrong but it\u2019s the kind of wrong I can understand someone caving on to do it but for the love  of cheese don\u2019t be stupid and tell him now that you\u2019ve done it.", "Id be pissed but i get it. \n\nCan you ask for a moving forward plan? \n\n\"Hey spouse, you know you get messages from family every 6 months and it results in a lot of upset for you? \n\n\nI get why you might feel some means of communicating need to be open, but we both also know your reactions are a big problem. \n\nWould it be possible for you to trust me with those messages? Where i see them, review then to make sure there is nothing new (apology. News for family- death, birth; etc) and then delete them? Or before deleting i take a screenshot with my phone so you can review in a controlled setting (predictable day, with therapist, etc)", "NTA and honestly, I would go a step further.  I\u2019d go on his phone and block them myself.", "NTA but you need to suggest this to him, tell him what you did this time and why, that you realize even though you meant well you crossed a line and should have asked him first. If he\u2019s ok with you doing this then great but if not you need to respect that.", "YTA.  You don't know if he is using that continual contact to build a case for either harassment or to get a restraining order.  The text you deleted might have been the last one he needed to move forward and now you've set him back.\n\nHe does need counseling to come up with better coping techniques when those messages come through rather than resorting to destructive decisions.", "YTA, sorry.  To be clear, I understand why you did this, and I understand how frustrating it can be, and how you're trying to help.  But I also think you're going about it wrong, and honestly, probably in a way that will invoke similar feelings in your husband.  He'll feel controlled, infantilized, and invalidated. \n\nWhat you need to be doing is supporting him, and understanding that one doesn't turn off a lifetime of abuse and conditioning like a light switch.  Please understand that he was literally groomed from birth to see abuse as 'normal' and 'loving.'  Don't blame him for not being able to simply reformat his brain and move on.\n\nI mean, he's going to therapy?  Great! He's already way ahead of most people in this situation.  So maybe celebrate that, even while you acknowledge there's more work to do, and that he needs to get his self-destruction under control.\n\nYou didn't 'save' him from anything.  He knows the text should be there.  He can be just as consumed wondering why it isn't as he is reading it.  Your actions don't address the root problem.\n\nApproach this as you wanting to understand him better, not you trying to convince him of anything.  \"Babe, can you help me understand why you still accept messages from them, even though they upset you terribly?\"  Hell, you can even suggest that maybe you can read the messages before he does, and if they're not 'uncle John is in the hospital' type messages, then delete them for him.\n\nYou can also set boundaries like 'If you start drinking heavily, the kids and I will leave for a few days' or 'If you drive drunk, I will be seeking a divorce.  I cannot stay in a relationship with a man who risks his own life, and the lives of others, by being irresponsible and reckless.'\n\nBut honestly, if you've never been in a situation like this, it can be hard to really register how it fucks you up.  This guy's parents, which our society practically deifies as the people who will always love you, always be there for you, always has your best interests at heart, who brought you into this world so they can love you and cherish you, did none of that.  Not only that, they hurt him.  Badly.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to reconcile that in your head?", "NTA. I would originally rule otherwise for something like this, but considering the situation, if your husband has difficulty handling it you have a right to filter.", "Yeah nta. I'd have gone farther and blocked their numbers. It could be his choice to unblock them, but the fact he has them unblocked shows he doesn't have the heart to do it himself. Good for you for saving your spouse's sanity, even if it was just temporarily.", "While you\u2019re at it go ahead and block the whole family so this is no longer an issue", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA only because you don\u2019t have his permission. I get why you are doing it, but work with him to establish a protocol. Sit down tonight and let him know what you did and why and apologize.  It ask going forward if you can continue to delete them, if he says no, respect that. I\u2019d also be adamant that he needs much more therapy and needs to be actively working on it. Driving drunk is unacceptable and you shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells because his temper can\u2019t be controlled.", "Either a NTA or ESH. You shouldn't have to deal with him flipping out and spiraling to the extent that he does when he gets them. I know it's understandable that he does, and you said he's trying to get help for it (this might be something to bring up in therapy if/when you go together and ask how to handle these texts in the future), but it's still not something you should need to deal with. So while you shouldn't have interfered in his personal business, you also are allowed to protect yourself. Also, it was done from a good place - your intention was to help him, as well, and seem to have been successful as he had a good birthday.", "I expect this will be a controversial take, but NTA. People need to stop conflating basic human rights with social rights, these are two very different things.\n\nYou know that your husband actively puts himself and others in harms way as his mental health hits a crisis point due to this specific trigger.\n\nOur social rights only extend to the point where they begin to endanger ourselves and others. That\u2019s how laws work, that\u2019s how mental health treatment works, that\u2019s how child protection works. That\u2019s how the balance between social rights and personal responsibility works.\n\nHe could\u2019ve blocked them and resolved this issue himself, knowing the impact it has on him. His refusal to take responsibility for his actions forfeited his right to privacy on his phone because his privacy (a social right) doesn\u2019t trump other people\u2019s safety (a basic human right).", "I would not delete them without permission.  I hear what your saying,  but he might still want the text messages if he isn't blocking the number.   Maybe he is waiting for some apology or some explanation, maybe he needs to know they are still alive or dead, or maybe its the only connection he has control even though it ruins his day or depresses him, maybe he wants to keep a record of it for legal purposes or is satisfied they are attempting contact and HE can reject them in a safe place, I don't know.  I would be interested if he is keeping the messages as screenshots for some reason.  Its still his family and I don't think you have the right to keep him in the dark.   I would tell him you want to delete them to keep him safe and see if that is ok, but really you don't have a right to do this without permission.  I would not want someone else to do that for me.  It could be a very personal and emotional thing.  Maybe offer to have him just hand you his phone and let you delete for him, after you both read it and offer to offer support if its difficult.  It is always better to discuss issues with someone who loves you.", "You don't know why he hasn't blocked them, but decided to take it on yourself to do it for him.  YTA it's his decision to make.", "As someone who has had to cut off abusive family members, NTA.

I have to say, it *is* pretty strange he hasn't straight up blocked their numbers, though. \n\nI would probably not be comfortable unilaterally taking control long term and would explain, apologize and ask what he wants to do in the future moving forward.", "Info: Was it a special day the day you deleted it? What made you believe he would get one then?\n\nOkay NTA after the response\n\nI\u2019m no contact with my parents and I wish someone would go through the mail and grab all the hurtful reminders of my time with them.

He's working on it. \n\nI know your experiences aren't his, but this is still  valuable window into what may be going on. \n\nI will speak with him, own my fuck-up, and try to discuss the bigger issue here. \n\nAppreciate it.", "Yeah, you may have had a better day but you have no idea how he would react if he finds out you did this or if you continue doing it. I would sit down with him soon and ask him if he would be open to this in the future, with his permission.", "I kind of lean this way. I FULLY understand why you want to do this, but I also just want to point out, he could block them. Your method of deleting the messages could make him think they've finally given up or forgotten about him and when he discovers you've been deleting them for months/years without ever telling him how is he going to feel?\n\nI think it may come off more controlling than you might imagine.\n\nI'm not sure there's aright way but Id give him the choice. Say if it were to happen where you could delete them before he saw them wouldnhe want you to?\n\nNot ideal. But at least slightly better. \n\nI know they were assholes. I know you want better for him. But trust me you can grow up with the worst of people and still hang on to the tiniest shreds of hope.", "Shit.\n\nThis is some next-level honesty, and I really appreciate it. Like, really. It's hard; I'm trying my best; If I'm TA, I will 100% own that. \n\nIt's taken me literally years to appreciate what an epic journey my spouse is on - something intense and ongoing, as you say. It cannot be easy to orphan oneself. \n\nMy souse and I will talk. We'll make it through this. Thank you again.", "Agree with you ,perhaps the fact they think of him is important even if temporarily upsetting . Also he could have blocked them . \nTo the OP apology is best sooner than later , you were emotional for him and reacted , very understandable but if you let it go on it appears controlling .", "Thank you. \n\nIt wasn't nice. The usual \"I've changed; I pray to God you'll be a good child and forgive me instead of holding onto your grievances like the asshole you've always been \" stuff. \n\nI wouldn't consider it \"important\". If someone had died, I'd have told my spouse.", "You know, you're the first one to bring up ME. It probably sounds really selfish; I know this isn't about ME and I'M not the one with the trauma...But it does suck. And maybe there's a conversation to be had about how this is affecting us as a couple. \n\nAnyway, I accept and appreciate your ESH judgment. I think we'll be able to talk through  it.", "Fair; I'll take that judgement. Thank you for responding.", "Thank you. Yes; it was his birthday and I suspected there'd be a text. There was. I deleted it. I'm not proud of it, but it was the best damn birthday we've ever had. \n\nIf it mattes, our phones aren't exactly \"private\" after 15 years of marriage. We know each other's passwords and whoever is closest to whatever phone will read the email/text message/notification. \n\nDoesn't make what I did right, but maybe provides some context.", ">If he can get messages from them,  he's not really NC, is he?\n\nThanks for pointing this out. Yes, it's a very uncomfortable situation. He has not responded to any communication for literally years, but still gets them. He has never articulated why, but some people on this thread have shared stories that could explain why a person wouldn't block. \n\nAppreciate the question and judgement.", "My husband went into my phone and put on auto-filter for my sister's emails because every time she sent one I was having anxiety attacks.\nI was so relieved.\n\nIt wasn't a secret but it was something I wasn't willing/able to do for myself.\n\nMaybe have a talk to him about blocking or rerouting the texts. Talk to him about how much they affect him. How much hurt and damage they're still causing because they have this way to get to him. \n\nNTA", "I'm not judging you for doing this at all. You're a filter. You can look at the message, decide if your husband needs to know, and get rid of it if he doesn't.\n\nWhether or not it's *right* is up for debate, but I don't think it's an AH move.", "NTA as a whole\n\nI would give you a tiny YTA for going through his phone but sometimes you have to take initiative and bend a bit of rules to protect someone. I hope I don't get any down votes for this but I still say NTA as a whole because you clearly love your husband you don't want him to hurt himself and fall back behind his treatment so what you did was actually really nice of you. But I hope you talk to him again and make it known that if he doesn't want to talk or here anything about is parents tonight a has to block them or confronting if he's ready . Because i don't think you can do this every time this special occasion or everyday because parents will find a way to communicate that children and as far as is your night always will be there to take its full and delete the messages . So i would policy say that you should have a sit down and baking tray please blocked number", "Could you ask him hypothetically if he would be okay with you doing that?  Light YTA\u2026 your intentions were good, but guessing since you\u2019re doubting yourself maybe you think he wouldn\u2019t be okay with it.", "There is such as thing as a justified AH", "NTA.\n\nBut honestly I would have just secretly blocked them years ago. Right now, just go in and block them for good, just incase they text him again or you miss the next. \n\nIt's perfectly OK to block, filter, and delete things for our kids and spouses if it would be detrimental to them.", "Nta you\u2019re protecting your husbands mental health and your own.", "Can he block their numbers maybe?", "How are you holding up with it? Those self-destructive episodes can't have been easy for you to deal with either.", "You need to discuss with him why he hasn\u2019t blocked them. Even if he doesn\u2019t read the messages, each one has a serious negative effect on him and subsequently the rest of you. He may need therapy to come to the answer.", "Can I say that, even though I agree that you made a misstep here, you are an amazingly good person and your spouse is lucky to have you. Dealing with this shit is HARD, as a bystander. There's even a term for it - secondary victim. You may benefit from counselling too.", "I think it might really help in the long run to gently urge him to talk about why he hasn't blocked them. If he hasn't talked about it in therapy, maybe suggest that too. There could be valid reasons that he doesn't want to cut contact completely, but honestly if it's been years and it still makes him spiral that bad, it might be better to cut them off completely at least until he's in a better place. Either way, going behind his back is not sustainable in the long run, but it's clear that your intentions are good and it's no easy feat to deal with that sort of thing. So just...try and support your husband in his decisions regardless, but if he hasn't really figured out himself if and why he doesn't want to block his family completely, it might be good to work on that.", "Don't beat yourself up, you've done this for the right reasons. I'd maybe tell them what you did and why, and ask if they'd like you to do it in future. If they're happy with that then they've got a buffer from unnecessarily feeling bad whilst being transparent and honest.", "Makes sense! NTA, glad the day ended up pleasant!", ">  You can look at the message, decide if your husband needs to know, and get rid of it if he doesn't.\n\nSeriously?  \"You, as his spouse, get to decide what family members he can and cannot communicate with, and what those communications are allowed to be.\"", ">Because i don't think you can do this every time this special occasion or everyday because parents will find a way to communicate that children and as far as is your night always will be there to take its full and delete the messages .\n\nExcellent point.", "OP mentions he hasn't blocked them and doesn't know why, it's likely that he's not emotionally ready to do so unfortunatley.", "That's very kind of you to ask. My spouse and I are coming up on our 15th wedding anniversary. He's really a lovely person and I admire the hell out of him. He's funny and smart and resilient and a phenomenal cook. But I guess I'm not coping with these self-destructive episodes as well as I thought, given that I felt the need to deceive to avoid one. \n\nI think we could maybe benefit from some couple's counselling. We've tried to talk about how to handle his family reaching out to him; we really have. It usually ends with him sharing some childhood story that horrifies me. Like, episode-of-Dateline horrifies me. I honestly don't even know what to say most of the time.\n\nThank you again. We will talk."]}
