It sounds like it saved him (and you) from a lot of pain. A lesser of two evils situation.\nI hope he can eventually emotionally recover from what his family put him through.", ">but it ruins his day/week/month and he often reacts in very self-destructive ways\n\nThis for me makes you NTA ...\n\nYes it's bad you did that, it seems controlling but in the end you try to prevent him from hurting himself and probably saw no other real option. I get behind why you did that. The execution may not have been the best, but honestly I'm not able to coming up with a better solution because *he* is not taking actions to prevent that... and I wouldn't want to see my partner hurting so much either.", "Hi. I grew up with toxic parents and went no contact about 15 years ago. I have not blocked them, although limited the ways they can contact me (e.g. they have my phone number but not my e-mail and or other things I use to communicate with my friends nor do they know my social handles etc.). I too get such messages, and yes I also get upset.\n\nWhy do I not block them? The simplest explanation would be that somewhere deep down I still have a tiny glimpse of hope that one beautiful day, they have an epiphany or come to an actual realization. Even if that realization would be that I do indeed not wish to get messages from them, so looking forward to a new year's eve without one of these texts. Or wake up one birthday morning to a simple and not guilt-trippy best wishes message that just says \"happy birthday\". \n\nCan't say if your partner's reasons are the same as mine. Maybe it would be better to block them. Maybe not. Stuff for them to explore in therapy. \n\nHowever I would freak out if my partner would go and delete messages, even these ones, from my phone without my knowledge. I value my privacy, and I value being able to make my own decisions, because I'm still haunted and feel violated by how my parents infringed on these. My mom would hide messages from friends from me in order to manipulate me into thinking people don't like me anymore. Or she would go around telling relatives and friends that I did not like them anymore and they should stop contacting me. Parents would go through my private conversations. Parents would make unilateral decisions on my behalf all the time.\n\nAgain, can't say your partner feels violated in the same way. \n\nI know you want to protect your partner, but I don't think this is the way. I can see your intentions are good, but the road to hell is paved with these you know. I wouldn't call you can asshole for what you did, but you made a mistake and should try to resolve it. \n\nNTA but please please please talk to your partner about this, own up to what you did, discuss how to proceed, accept if they are mad, apologize accordingly, find a way to move forward. You are not an AH to be worried about your spouse, or for the fact you don't want to see them suffer. But maybe this isn't the way to help.", "I\u2019d say YTA but in a very justified, n.ta sort of way.

You aren't doing him any favors by delaying his ultimate rock bottom. \n\nWhy aren't you addressing this with him in between those messages?

YTA. \n\nI could see my wife doing this and me getting pretty upset. She\u2019s gotten text from my parents before and took days to tell me. It seems to be an invasion of privacy and a bit controlling. You didn\u2019t want it to ruin your day or send him spiraling. Do these texts activate you as well? \n\nGoing no contact with immediate family is not something you go lightly into and it\u2019s an extremely personal experience. The amount of grieving is intense and ongoing. When first going nc, I set boundaries with my parents, to see if they over step them. When they did, I could point it out and provide repercussions, like a restraining order. It also lets me know I did the right thing by going NC when I saw their ugly abusive messages.\n\nIt\u2019s his choice how, when and if he communicates with his family. He hasn\u2019t blocked them and maybe that\u2019s for a reason/emotional reason you\u2019re unaware of. That was my last step and it was the most painful thing I\u2019ve done.

I have my reasons for keeping them as Facebook friends though, and I completely limited them to that as their only way to contact me.\n\nWhile I don't truly ever expect them to change or to ever see them again, I guess there's some part of me that things possibly. I also sometimes just browse their pages to see what's up in their lives, and if I'm being honest, there's a part of me that hopes they see my posts and get jealous of my arguably pretty fabulous life I made for myself after going no contact.\n\nSo, while I fully understand why you did what you did, it wasn't your decision to make.

He needs to take control by either blocking them himself or finding a way to regulate his own emotions so that days/weeks/months are not ruined.  It\u2019s not fair to either of you and can\u2019t be good for your relationship.  I highly recommend finding a therapist who can help him.

He should be grown up enough to block them. If simply not getting these messages changes the outcome of the whole holiday than he should not be subjecting himself to them, but more importantly, he should not be subjecting you to his emotional abuse when he gets them. He\u2019s also harming you by making you dread holidays and special events, that should be fun, by opening himself, and by extension you, up to these messages and those people. \n\nHonestly, if I were you I\u2019d talk to him about how unfair it is to you that he doesn\u2019t block them.

Either way, you are a loving and protective spouse.", "NTA. I would say YTA if his day was also ruined by not getting the expected text, but it wasn\u2019t, he had a good day. Whether you bring it up now after the fact is up to you. You know your husband better than any of us do, so only you would know whether you going through his phone would upset him.  And since it sounds like you don\u2019t really talk about it, maybe it\u2019s a good time to bring it up. Not to force him one way or another or anything like that, but simply to gage where his head space is at with it.", "YTA \n\nSure you had good intentions. \n\nHe needs to block them. \n\nHe needs to make that decision. \n\nYou\u2019re not his Mum. He\u2019s an adult and has to work through these things.", "Well-meaning, but YTA. It is his NC journey. It is his choice not to block them and maybe he doesn't for various reasons you're not privy to. I understand that he gets upset and that it upsets YOU, but ultimately taking the choice away feels violating and could potentially lead to resentment. Be careful. Talk with your husband.", "Considering he is literally a danger to himself and others when he gets these messages, I would say you are definitely NTA.  I might be initially angry with my spouse but, ultimately, when he explained why, I think I would have been grateful in this position.  If my brother I am NC with somehow managed to message me through all the ways I have him blocked and my spouse saw it and deleted it, I would ultimately be thankful that I did not have to deal with him.", "YTA because it's simply not your decision to make. You may have been well intentioned but you've taken away his power in this situation. It's not up to you to navigate this for him. The only thing you should do is be there for him as he deals with it.", "Hopefully you emptied the \"bin\" as well.", "Gentle YTA. \n\nI know you had good intentions, but he's an adult, it's his journey with his parents, and it should be his choice, not for you to take it from him. \n\nI understand this is hard for you too when he responds in destructive ways. Maybe talk about that, ask him how you can best support him through these times, and explain the effect this has on you too.", "I agree with Figment in that this is an ESH. Though you had good intentions, it doesn\u2019t negate the power you took away from him. Taking away someone\u2019s choice (even if you think it is justified) is called controlling them.\n\nYour husband on the other hand is seriously putting you and others in danger. His emotional abuse after he goes into a spiral isn\u2019t ok. I think your husband doesnt realize how much of an impact this is having on you, OP. But his drinking and driving is COMPLETELY unacceptable. What would have happened if he got into an accident, hurt someone else? You\u2019re life would be forever changed. \n\nI think you talk to hubby and explain to him as Figment said how much his actions are affecting you.", "Soft ESH. \n\nYou have good intentions and you know that every text ruins his birthdays in the past. So you want him to have a good day. \n\nHowever, I do suggest you tell him what you did, when it\u2019s appropriate and not a special day and maybe part of his therapy sessions.

You should speak about this in therapy and possibly come clean in there. I\u2019m sure this is effecting your mental health as well and you need to talk this out.

It's time to talk that out and ask him the questions you are asking us. We can't really read his mind and it's HIS call on whether or not what you did was appreciated or too far. It's definitely not ours.", "NTA - part of being a couple is protecting each other.  \nThat is all you did", "NTA. I'm gonna go a little out the box here and say your husband is the AH. He went NC, his family still contacts, and it upsets him to a place of destructive behavior. HE needs to deal with the issues. He needs therapy. Going NC doesn't heal the depth of the wounds. It just eases the picking. You protecting him from his family (and you protecting yourself from his response to them) can't and shouldn't be your job.\n\nShould you have deleted the message? Normally, I'd say no, but if it's to stop your husband from drinking and driving due to the stress of a text, you were within rights to do so. You shouldn't have to monitor their communication or walk on eggshells. His family is still controlling him, and he needs therapy.", "NTA, I\u2019d have done the same thing tbh and the fact that he never asked about it or was like hmmm they didn\u2019t text me means to me that he doesn\u2019t want them to message him. He may not have blocked them holding out some hope they might reach out to apologize in the future but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for doing what you did if they sent some generic bs message. I hope therapy starts to help him move on\u2026", "NTA. As his spouse, I think you did the right thing. You know how the messages and memories make him feel, and you did the only thing you could think of to make him feel better.

He can still remain relationships with the extended family", "Maybe you should check in with him during a neutral time and ask if he\u2019d like you to proactively delete messages he receives during special occasions?", "NTA it\u2019s wrong but it\u2019s the kind of wrong I can understand someone caving on to do it but for the love  of cheese don\u2019t be stupid and tell him now that you\u2019ve done it.", "Id be pissed but i get it. \n\nCan you ask for a moving forward plan? \n\n\"Hey spouse, you know you get messages from family every 6 months and it results in a lot of upset for you? \n\n\nI get why you might feel some means of communicating need to be open, but we both also know your reactions are a big problem. \n\nWould it be possible for you to trust me with those messages? Where i see them, review then to make sure there is nothing new (apology. News for family- death, birth; etc) and then delete them? Or before deleting i take a screenshot with my phone so you can review in a controlled setting (predictable day, with therapist, etc)", "NTA and honestly, I would go a step further.  I\u2019d go on his phone and block them myself.", "NTA but you need to suggest this to him, tell him what you did this time and why, that you realize even though you meant well you crossed a line and should have asked him first. If he\u2019s ok with you doing this then great but if not you need to respect that.", "YTA.  You don't know if he is using that continual contact to build a case for either harassment or to get a restraining order.  The text you deleted might have been the last one he needed to move forward and now you've set him back.\n\nHe does need counseling to come up with better coping techniques when those messages come through rather than resorting to destructive decisions.", "YTA, sorry.  To be clear, I understand why you did this, and I understand how frustrating it can be, and how you're trying to help.  But I also think you're going about it wrong, and honestly, probably in a way that will invoke similar feelings in your husband.  He'll feel controlled, infantilized, and invalidated. \n\nWhat you need to be doing is supporting him, and understanding that one doesn't turn off a lifetime of abuse and conditioning like a light switch.  Please understand that he was literally groomed from birth to see abuse as 'normal' and 'loving.'  Don't blame him for not being able to simply reformat his brain and move on.\n\nI mean, he's going to therapy?  Great! He's already way ahead of most people in this situation.  So maybe celebrate that, even while you acknowledge there's more work to do, and that he needs to get his self-destruction under control.\n\nYou didn't 'save' him from anything.  He knows the text should be there.  He can be just as consumed wondering why it isn't as he is reading it.  Your actions don't address the root problem.\n\nApproach this as you wanting to understand him better, not you trying to convince him of anything.  \"Babe, can you help me understand why you still accept messages from them, even though they upset you terribly?\"  Hell, you can even suggest that maybe you can read the messages before he does, and if they're not 'uncle John is in the hospital' type messages, then delete them for him.\n\nYou can also set boundaries like 'If you start drinking heavily, the kids and I will leave for a few days' or 'If you drive drunk, I will be seeking a divorce.  I cannot stay in a relationship with a man who risks his own life, and the lives of others, by being irresponsible and reckless.'\n\nBut honestly, if you've never been in a situation like this, it can be hard to really register how it fucks you up.  This guy's parents, which our society practically deifies as the people who will always love you, always be there for you, always has your best interests at heart, who brought you into this world so they can love you and cherish you, did none of that.  Not only that, they hurt him.  Badly.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to reconcile that in your head?", "NTA. I would originally rule otherwise for something like this, but considering the situation, if your husband has difficulty handling it you have a right to filter.", "Yeah nta. I'd have gone farther and blocked their numbers. It could be his choice to unblock them, but the fact he has them unblocked shows he doesn't have the heart to do it himself. Good for you for saving your spouse's sanity, even if it was just temporarily.", "While you\u2019re at it go ahead and block the whole family so this is no longer an issue", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA only because you don\u2019t have his permission. I get why you are doing it, but work with him to establish a protocol. Sit down tonight and let him know what you did and why and apologize.  It ask going forward if you can continue to delete them, if he says no, respect that. I\u2019d also be adamant that he needs much more therapy and needs to be actively working on it. Driving drunk is unacceptable and you shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells because his temper can\u2019t be controlled.", "Either a NTA or ESH. You shouldn't have to deal with him flipping out and spiraling to the extent that he does when he gets them. I know it's understandable that he does, and you said he's trying to get help for it (this might be something to bring up in therapy if/when you go together and ask how to handle these texts in the future), but it's still not something you should need to deal with. So while you shouldn't have interfered in his personal business, you also are allowed to protect yourself. Also, it was done from a good place - your intention was to help him, as well, and seem to have been successful as he had a good birthday.", "I expect this will be a controversial take, but NTA. People need to stop conflating basic human rights with social rights, these are two very different things.\n\nYou know that your husband actively puts himself and others in harms way as his mental health hits a crisis point due to this specific trigger.\n\nOur social rights only extend to the point where they begin to endanger ourselves and others. That\u2019s how laws work, that\u2019s how mental health treatment works, that\u2019s how child protection works. That\u2019s how the balance between social rights and personal responsibility works.\n\nHe could\u2019ve blocked them and resolved this issue himself, knowing the impact it has on him. His refusal to take responsibility for his actions forfeited his right to privacy on his phone because his privacy (a social right) doesn\u2019t trump other people\u2019s safety (a basic human right).", "I would not delete them without permission.  I hear what your saying,  but he might still want the text messages if he isn't blocking the number.   Maybe he is waiting for some apology or some explanation, maybe he needs to know they are still alive or dead, or maybe its the only connection he has control even though it ruins his day or depresses him, maybe he wants to keep a record of it for legal purposes or is satisfied they are attempting contact and HE can reject them in a safe place, I don't know.  I would be interested if he is keeping the messages as screenshots for some reason.  Its still his family and I don't think you have the right to keep him in the dark.   I would tell him you want to delete them to keep him safe and see if that is ok, but really you don't have a right to do this without permission.  I would not want someone else to do that for me.  It could be a very personal and emotional thing.  Maybe offer to have him just hand you his phone and let you delete for him, after you both read it and offer to offer support if its difficult.  It is always better to discuss issues with someone who loves you.", "You don't know why he hasn't blocked them, but decided to take it on yourself to do it for him.  YTA it's his decision to make.", "As someone who has had to cut off abusive family members, NTA.

I have to say, it *is* pretty strange he hasn't straight up blocked their numbers, though. \n\nI would probably not be comfortable unilaterally taking control long term and would explain, apologize and ask what he wants to do in the future moving forward.", "Info: Was it a special day the day you deleted it? What made you believe he would get one then?\n\nOkay NTA after the response\n\nI\u2019m no contact with my parents and I wish someone would go through the mail and grab all the hurtful reminders of my time with them.

I FULLY understand why you want to do this, but I also just want to point out, he could block them.

Say if it were to happen where you could delete them before he saw them wouldnhe want you to?\n\nNot ideal. But at least slightly better. \n\nI know they were assholes.

I hope I don't get any down votes for this but I still say NTA as a whole because you clearly love your husband you don't want him to hurt himself and fall back behind his treatment so what you did was actually really nice of you.

If he hasn't talked about it in therapy, maybe suggest that too. There could be valid reasons that he doesn't want to cut contact completely, but honestly if it's been years and it still makes him spiral that bad, it might be better to cut them off completely at least until he's in a better place. Either way, going behind his back is not sustainable in the long run, but it's clear that your intentions are good and it's no easy feat to deal with that sort of thing.

We had a similar problem with my in laws and my so refusing to block them. Every time he got a message I had to deal with his panics attacks and it took a huge toll on me. Him blocking them (or rather changing his number) saved both of us a lot of drama.\n\nIf he's not ready to block them, there are other solutions : having a new main number and keeping the old one in an old phone in a closet, removing notification from their numbers, etc... Sometimes it's just a fear of blocking them per see that's the problem, but not being able to see the message with knowing they have the possibility to do so can help.", "At some point when he's in a thoughtful mood,  maybe right before one of his therapy seasons,  maybe have a hypothetical conversation with him about would he like this kind of interference.  That you intercept messages from his parents. Don't press for an answer right away,  but ask him to think about what he wants. \n\nThe reality is that he hasn't blocked them. Is that because he wants to be available if they need to let him know about a death in family or other news? Is he going for the apology message? Does he still want to know they care enough to continue reaching out even though it pains him when they do? He may not be ready to reflect on this yet, just something to keep in mind.

I get you were coming from a good place, but it feels invasive if he isn\u2019t on board. Instead, you should have broached this topic ages ago and ask: what would you like me to do if I see a text come in from your parents before you do? Should I delete it?

He did block her at one point and then unlocked her to say Happy Mother's Day. After that, he wouldn't reblock her because he wanted her to get in touch in case of emergencies. He still wouldn't answer her calls, though. \n\nI don't think you did anything wrong because you are just looking out for his best interest and it seems like something he was unwilling to do.", "He should really block them.

What you did helped avert one attack of hurt, but it is not a sustainable solution to the problem. \n\nI think the best you can do is support your spouse in letting these horrible people loose.

As a general rule, what you did wasn\u2019t right.  But\u2026\n\nThis is having an impact on your life as well.  I probably would have done the same thing.

It\u2019s like he can\u2019t break free from the toxic co-dependency thing they\u2019ve got going.  \n\nIt also sounds like you both need to have a conversation about why he hasn\u2019t blocked them already.  At some point, you should come clean about what you did.  You acted on impulse.  And that\u2019s defensible on a one time basis.  It won\u2019t be if you continue to do this behind his back.  He had a great day without the toxic impact of his parents communication.  That can be a starting point to the conversation.

We've agreed that I field all the notifications so he doesn't have to deal with them because narcissistic drama doesn't affect me (both of my parents are as well, so I have 21 years of immunity, lol), and so his day doesn't get ruined.

But it reinforces the abuser's message that *they* don't deserve to have control over themselves.\n\nDeleting the messages seems easier in the short term, but you're better off having an honest discussion about it, and looping in the therapist to work on a system that doesn't leave him regularly self-harming because of their messages (and that's what drunk driving is: self-harm, as well as being harm to others).\n\nWhat works for you might be different, but for instance: My partner has an email inbox rule that re-directs messages from his family to a specific folder.

They are an independent adult and you don't have the right to decide for them what they see. If you reverse the genders, you can see how this type of thing can get toxic and weird very quickly. Especially as I'm sure there's plenty of other things you'd always want to \"protect\" your partner from.\nPermanent blocking their family without telling them is a very risky thing to do. I still say NTA because your intentions are good and background sounds quite extreme (and nobody wants the self destructive behaviour) but agree with other commenters that you should be very cautious of what you've done and bring up the concept (or other alternatives) with him directly soon.", "I can definitely sympathise with this short term solution, ig the real question is what to do from here", "I agree with not doing it now, but I'd suggest doing several weeks before the next likely text, since they seem to arrive on a fairly predictable schedule.", "So did you just decide not to read the part where they\u2019re abusive and send him on a destructive spiral every-time they message him? Or do you think you know better than her even though she\u2019s his wife and has been through this already?", "My guess is that it's not blocked because he's hoping that one day it will be a full, heartfelt apology for what they've done.", ">ig the real question is what to do from here\n\nTbh, if OP and her husband are able to afford it, I'd say couples therapy would be a good thing because husband's self-destructive episodes don't just affect him it affects OP as well, so couples therapy would be a safe place to discuss all of this and maybe help come up with a better plan, like if her husband isn't 100% ready to go fully NC, then maybe at least filter out his family's messages so they don't ruin his day/week/month and go on a self destructive spiral.\n\nETA: I also think individual therapy for OP as well because dealing with what OP has for 15 years isn't easy.", "It's entirely possible you're suffering from some secondary trauma just from hearing about his trauma (which it sounds like he should be seeing a therapist that specializes in trauma, if he's not) as well as suffering some from watching his self-destructive episodes. With the amount of abuse that pops up in this subreddit I didn't want to immediately mention couples counseling but I'm not getting any hints of abuse I would usually worry about. Couples counseling is always worth doing *before* you feel like your marriage is about to hit a breaking point, so it sounds like you could benefit.", "I did read that part.  Nevertheless, he is choosing to not block their communications, and she doesn't get to take that choice away from him.\n\nShe can choose what she'll do in response to his choice to allow the contact and spiral, but she doesn't get to filter his communications without his permission.", "and that's the saddest part of all. :(", "Thank you again. This is very good advice and I appreciate it.", "Oh ok so just so I\u2019m understanding you correctly you think its ok for him to get so bad he drinks himself into oblivion and will also drive that way, risking the lives of so many people including his own btw, BUT that shes wrong for caring about him and his wellbeing enough to want to stop the spiral before it starts? You\u2019re an idiot.", "Happy to help! I hope everything goes well for you both.", "> Oh ok so just so I\u2019m understanding you correctly \n\nYou are not, you're just digging in because you want to 'win' rather than 'understand.'\n\n> you think its ok for him to get so bad he drinks himself into oblivion and will also drive that way, risking the lives of so many people including his own btw\n\nNo, I think it's terrible, and I've said in other comments that OP needs to lay some boundaries around that, including 'I will not be in a relationship with somebody who drives drunk.'\n\n>  BUT that shes wrong for caring about him and his wellbeing enough to want to stop the spiral before it starts?\n\nIs she wrong for caring about him?  No.  Is she wrong for invading his privacy, taking away his agency to make his own choices, and starting to tread into the same behavior his parents would have shown?  Yes.\n\nAgain, it's his choice to communicate with his parents or not.  It's her choice to tolerate the outcome of his decision, or not.  She can encourage him to healthier dynamics, she can support him, she can tell him what she won't accept and what her actions will be, but she can't arrogate to herself the power to censor his communications or delete his messages.  Or to isolate him from people he chooses to be in contact with.\n\nShe doesn't have to sit back and do nothing, but she can only make choices for herself, not for him.", "Can I just say this whole interaction made me happy that compassion exists. OP definitely make sure you\u2019re taking care of yourself too individually, there is a reason many professional therapists have mandatory therapy to manage hearing what their clients have experienced. You have a very different lived experience and will need space to process what has happened to someone you love.\n\nAnd please be kind to yourself, you seem like a great person who reacted based on different experiences/needs, have owned that it wasn\u2019t the right call, and are committed to learning from it. I would have had the same instinct as you out of protection so can absolutely see why you did it with the best in mind.\n\nYou\u2019re doing your genuine best, and as my own therapist taught me that is all anyone can ever reasonably ask of you.", "Already you\u2019re wrong. I don\u2019t care about winning, you do. What I do care about is OP\u2019s husband unlike you. The issue here is either you don\u2019t know what its like to have people care about you and the steps that they\u2019ll take to prevent harm or you don\u2019t care that she cares enough to actually actively do something to help her husband that isn\u2019t just sitting idly by and watch him damn near die. \n\nShow me your work, how exactly does preventing your spouse\u2019s abusers from contacting him make you just like them? Especially since he\u2019s not contacting them they\u2019re contacting him and he has never responded a single time. \n\nOnce again you\u2019re an idiot and I hope for the sake of others you\u2019re never put in a position like OP because you\u2019d be no help at all.", "> Show me your work, how exactly does preventing your spouse\u2019s abusers from contacting him make you just like them?
