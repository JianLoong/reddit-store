Someone coming up with a different excuse every time you try to make food for them should signal that they don\u2019t want it.

I am losing control of food, that means I have less control in life, call in the eating disorder symptoms! That levels it out!\n\nI am a healthy BMI (most people see me a skinny but I also gain quite fast due to health issues caused by wrecking my digestive system with an ED and having chronic illness.)

But jesus of all the things to relapse my eating disorder on, it would be insult to injury.)\n\nAnd my work goes down when I am back to obsessing about avoiding the food being shoved on me. I have to choose to disclose to HR because it is a disability and covered by the ADA/Equality Act. Which often in a culture where work spouses and office food culture of \u2018oh go on\u2019 is normalised makes me the weird problem fun sponge and impacts how I am viewed.\n\nYou know how people here say how people are weird when you don\u2019t drink. Imagine how they get when you don\u2019t eat the way most people do in the current food culture? It quickly becomes like being bullied even if you take the crush out here.\n\nIf you bring food, leave it for people to choose to take. And never ever give anyone a calorie counter unprompted. Men get eating disorders too. But even at my sickest with anorexia where I was having panic attacks watching people eat \u2018unhealthy\u2019 food that might cause weight gain in them, I knew this kind of micro managing was so inappropriate toward them.

It's never been an issue because there's always good boundaries about what is and isn't appropriate, and nobody is seeking out opportunities to push the boundaries. Car coworker and I still chat either in the work kitchen or in his office with the door open (which is company culture; doors closed for official/private meetings and open for informal chats), even after spending a good about of time in the car chatting about the lost coworker and then some decorating he and his wife were doing.\n\nThe female coworker who brings in baked goods doesn't make them for specific people (unless it's a birthday of a close work friend) and if someone says they have allergies, she asks if they want her to try and accepts if they say no.
