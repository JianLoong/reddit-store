But the rest of your life is (hopefully) a long time, and there's something you need to realize now, because it's an issue for... the rest of your life.\n\nI don't need to tell you this, but just to be very clear... in your mind, your daughter's mind, your granddaughter's mind (when she's able to understand) -- all of them are (far) more important than your husband of 6 months. Or 6 years. Or even 6 decades. This isn't even close. Your daughter and whoever she's with and your one or more grandkids -- that's your family. That's your legacy. That's your past and future.\n\nThe guy you married? He's the guy you married. As far as your daughter, etc are concerned, it could be anyone. Just happens to be this guy.\n\nIn an ideal world, the guy would be supportive of you and your daughter and everything else that comes with it. He should be welcoming all of this with open arms. A chance to be a step-grandad, and so on.\n\nInstead, it's this shit... and it's awful. It's too bad. And it's not too late... because you need to think long and hard about the next 20 years and more.\n\nAll of the life-cycle events that come with daughters and grandkids that you would want to be there for. Baptisms, Bat-Mitzvahs, Kindergarten graduation, HS graduation, engagement parties etc etc etc etc. You want to, deserve to and NEED to be part of it. And if you have some asshole husband holding you back from that, you will be miserable.\n\nSit him down now and lay it straight, and lay it on the line. This my daughter, my granddaughter, my family, and my life.
