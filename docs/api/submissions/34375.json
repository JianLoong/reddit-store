And while you're at it, stop doing all the chores.\n\nThere's no reason for you to be his bangmaid.", "100% NTA\n\nGirl, i would never cook for his ungrateful ass ever again, i would literally let this man starve until he begs you for food or goes running back to his mommy. Also, lets this be a sign for the future, your entire life will be like this he will continue to \u201cfault\u201d everything you do so you \u201clearn\u201d.", "NTA he can make his own food from now on. It seems like he\u2019s comparing you to his family because that\u2019s what he wants you to be. Also the last line about him calling you sensitive is red flags. He\u2019s invalidating your feelings and making them seem like a joke.", "NTA, tell him he can go marry his sister if he wants her cooking. \n\nStop worrying about the cooking, make whatever you feel like for food, and he can get those specific foods somewhere else.", "NTA - you gotta run, as fast and as far as those legs can carry you. I\u2019m not one to immediately rush to advice someone to leave their partner but in your case i would. So My background is very similar to yours except that in my case it\u2019s my husband\u2019s sisters in law that are domestic goddesses who dont work, as is his Mom. While he doesn\u2019t criticise my cooking, my problem is that he doesn\u2019t lift a finger for anything else - it\u2019s supposedly my job to pick up after him, to make him breakfast (we have a cook for the other meals), to do the dishes, etc etc.. I got a very small hint of this before we were married but as soon as we did get married, this was the standard set. Note that I am a working professional and also earn more than him. About 90% of child rearing is also my responsibility. Unfortunately I won\u2019t leave him because I have a child with him, but if someone had told me about how things would end up for me I would NEVER have married him. So my advice to you is save yourself! It\u2019s not worth it. You are worth so much much more. Even if you end up single for the rest of your life (it might seem like it now but it most likely wont and you might meet someone wonderful who would be an equal partner), it\u2019s a wayyyy better life that you\u2019ll lead than one waiting on someone hand and foot.", "NTA. It's bad enough that he's expecting you to cook everything he wants and go to all this effort to get different ingredients and learn different recipes etc without helping or ever doing it himself. I could maybe understand if he genuinely didn't realise how much effort you were putting in and apologised and stopped saying the things he did once you talked to him about it, but the way he's reacted to you telling him is honestly disgusting. Refusing to apologise and saying he will continue to do it, and also trying to shame you for having (valid) emotions? Yikes.\n\nI'm not one of these people that will instantly scream \"Divorce him!\" when a dude does something wrong, but honestly I would consider it in your situation. He doesn't value your time or respect your feelings. Tell him to go marry one of his sisters if he wants to eat their cooking every day \ud83d\ude44", "NTA\nYour fianc\u00e9 is though. He\u2019s disrespectful for a start. If you marry this man you are going to be miserable. He will always compare you to his sisters. Nothing you do will ever be good enough for him and his family. You are laying yourself open like a lamb to the slaughter. Meanwhile your husband won\u2019t have to lift a finger and will be criticising you about food after you have already done an 8 hour shift and cleaned up after him. You might as well just give up work now and spend the rest of your days serving.", ">He also said he will fault my food so I will learn.\n\nTime for you to do the same. Criticise his driving, his job, his clothes,etc. until he learns (not to criticise you ever again!)", "NTA But this relationship won't work. He wants you to be his housewife, even if you earn all the money. And don't have a child with this man, he'd expect you to be the full-time parent. If you are lucky he might 'help' you occasionally.", "INFO: are you being forced to marry this person from 1954?", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is rude and ungrateful. Comparing you to the women of his family is uncalled for and such a massive red flag.\n\n> He also said he will fault my food so I will learn. \n\nYou are doing your best and he's tearing you down? He's causing resentment and is not being a very good partner.

So I guess you both work, but you have to run the household because you're a woman, while he sits on his ass? These cultures are so toxic. Basically they force women to either work themselves to death by combining paid and domestic work, or make themselves vulnerable by deciding to be a housewife. Whether you work or not, domestic duties are only on the woman. If you're not a perfect housewife, you're guilted and shamed by family members. It'll be difficult to change anything about this dynamic, good luck.", "NTA\n\nI would tell him that you will stay home and become the perfect housewife as soon he is able to make up for your income and pays you the ecaxt same salary for running his household as your employer does. \n\nTill then, chores will be split 50/50 from now on and since your cooking is not to his standard, cooking will be his chore and when he compares your chores to how his mom/sister does it, you will do the same with his chores.", "NTA. I would actually reconsider marriage to him.\n\nHe's making hurtful comments, not appreciative, thankful nor understanding of you. I don't see his behaviour getting better with his traditional mindset and it sounds like it'll only get worse in time.", "So now you know how he is, are you planning on continuing this relationship? You know what happens next, you\u2019ll be solely responsible for raising your kids, cook, clean, etc, etc.", "NTA\n\nI really enjoy cooking and I enjoy cooking for other people. I always tell people if they don't like the food not to force themselves to eat it. If they have comments on the food I openly welcome them because to do so encourages growth and a better understanding of other folks pallets.\n\nWith that being said, comparing your cooking to someone else's isn't fair. It's rude and inconsiderate and I wouldn't tolerate it either.\n\nI would like to add though, if it's possible, cooking with or learning with your new SIL or MIL may be a fun bonding experience.", "Sounds to me like y'all gonna be ordering a lot of pizza from now on", "NTA sounds like he's conditioning you to be his servant.  Tell him since his sister and mom do everything so much better maybe he should go sleep with them. He can bring back those lessons for his next wife.  \n\nMore sarcasm... maybe you should offer to get lessons from his brother in law and father since they do such a good job that the wives are throwing themselves into servitude. Obviously hubby isn't hitting it right that you're not all indoctrinated. Those who can do... in his case those who can't teach. \n\nRUN... DON'T WALK AWAY, RUN.", "NTA but why are you putting up with this sort of ancient nonsense. Come on, tell your fianc\u00e9 this kind of misogynistic crap doesn't fly with you and stop acting like a servant.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is abusive and it will only get worse. \u201cYou\u2019re so sensitive\u201d is manipulation. When you get married you will still be working, cooking, cleaning, doing all the child care. He will never help with any of it and everything will be your fault. Leave him. Run far away.", "NTA, for all the reasons others have given.\n\nI wonder how he would feel if you used the same approach with him in bed? \u201cI will fault you until you get it right. Ask your brother, he ALWAYS gets it right.\u201d\n\n(Obvs, don\u2019t, but that would be funny)", "NTA. Tell him to cook for himself. What an asshole.", "Your fianc\u00e9 is mean and inconsiderate.

You're even doing your best to improve your skills and cooking what he requests yet he's not acknowledging your efforts! NTA", "NTA - don\u2019t cook for him until he learns gratitude. You\u2019re not in a cooking competition. All he should ever say after a meal you shopped and cooked for is \u201cThank you, that was lovely.\u201d Cook the food that you like. If he wants his sister\u2019s recipes, he needs to learn to cook them. Unless you like those dishes yourself, there\u2019s no reason for you to spend time learning them. Good luck. It sounds like there may be some difficult conversations in your house. Stand your ground and don\u2019t let him belittle you. You cried because he upset you by being rude and ungrateful- and then he doubled down and called you sensitive. He needs to apologise and mean it.", "I never understand the \"my fiance\" part of these questions.\n\nHe's being an ass, you know it, and it hurts you. What does he do around the house, given that you also work outside the home?\n\nOf course you're NTA for not cooking for him anymore. He can cook that dish to show you.

Someone who regularly makes you feel like shit for trying your hardest is an asshole and not marriage material.", "NTA why are you playing servant when you work full time! If you both work duties should be SHARED. Value yourself more.", "NTA but don't expect things will get better just because you get married- it may or may not, or it may even get worse. If he's like this when you're not even bound to him yet, what more if you already are...\n\nJust because you're from the same ethnicity/culture doesn't necessarily mean you have the same values/expectations. And it doesn't necessarily mean you are/he is a bad person, it's just incompatibility. \n\nUse this engagement period to vet if you want this type of life and husband *for the rest of your life*. Once you're married and have kids, it's pretty hard to revert to how you imagined your future would go.", "Since you both work, both of you also need to do chores and cook.

If he refuses to cook for you or do chores - you also stop doing them.", "NTA - fault your food so you learn is really inconsiderate and hurtful.
