My son has a motor delay that causes him to be unable to walk on his own.  Instead, he uses a walker or wheelchair.  \n\nFor backstory, my in-laws like to take eco-tourism type vacations with my wife\u2019s whole family.  These vacations routinely include hiking, staying at lodges that are not designed to be accessible for people using adaptive devices, and activities that require motor control that my son does not have.  In the past, my wife and I have helped our son to participate.  This means that during hikes, I would carry him in a [Freeloader child carrier]( https://myfreeloader.com/).  When we are staying at lodges that are not accessible to his wheelchair or walker, my wife and I would either carry him or walk with him, holding his hands.  When we would do activities like ziplining or fishing, we would help him so that he would feel like he was doing it, but we would do most of or all of the work.  We don\u2019t mind doing any of these things, but he is getting bigger, and we aren\u2019t going to be able to carry him forever. \n\nWe were having dinner with my in laws earlier this week, and they were telling us about the next big vacation they have planned for the whole family.  It includes staying in a lodge in a rainforest, hiking, kayaking, fishing, etc.  While the trip looks really cool, we asked about how this was going to work with our son.  They basically suggested that he stay in the lodge with a babysitter while we did all of the fun activities, and that maybe it is time that he learn that he is not going to be able to do everything that everyone else does.  My wife and I immediately shut this idea down.  We both told my in-laws that we would not go on a vacation that would include him on the plane, but exclude him the rest of the time.  We also told them that if they want our family to participate in whole family vacations, then they need to plan vacations that are inclusive of his abilities.  \n\nAfter we got home from dinner, my wife and I discussed whether we were in the right.  We feel like we might be the AHs because by choosing not to go on these vacations, we are also denying our daughter the ability to see and do things she would never get to see and do otherwise.  \n\nWe work hard to avoid creating artificial limitations for our daughter based upon our son\u2019s capabilities.  We also work very hard to avoid situations that would require the outright exclusion of our son from participating in fun activities.  Most of the time, we can avoid these problems by dividing and conquering.  One of us will take our daughter to do an activity that our son cannot do, and the other will take him to do something else that is fun.  The issue is that we cannot really do that on these types of vacations.\n\nAre we the assholes for trying to refusing to go on these vacations?\n\nEdit to add:  Before this gets to be a chance for everyone to bash my in-laws, I should point out a few things:\n\n1.  My father-in-law is 72.  FIL sometimes sits out things because he feels like he would struggle to keep up.  I think he was suggesting that it is okay to sit out things at times.\n\n2.  This has only come up recently because my son is getting bigger and I am getting concerned about the toll that carrying him will take on my body.  For the past several years, we have been able to do eco-trips that included all of these activities, but my son was lighter then.\n\n3.  My inlaws are generally good people and have always helped with my kids.  They simply don't think about these issues because I have always been able to muscle through obstacles.", "created_utc": 1676570942, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113wykm/aita_for_telling_my_inlaws_that_my_family_would/", "score": 291, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A healthy family should be able to include activities for everyone on their vacation. Okay, we're going to go swimming, but where we're going also has this nice horseback ride for those who can't swim and this nice play area for those who are afraid of animals and they don't know how to swim either, that's what inclusion is all about.

But, a week of nonstop physical activities is a step too far.", "OP needs to have a talk with their daughter- she might feel restricted, or she might feel just as offended as the parents, or both or anywhere in between. \n\nThe most important thing is to make sure she\u2019s heard before any final decisions are made.", "Maybe, but it would be essentially outsourcing what I already do.  I carry him on my back.  My concern is that he is already around 70 pounds, and will likely be over 100 pounds in a year or two.  I don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt carrying him.  I certainly don\u2019t want to have his weight hurt someone who doesn\u2019t have good healthcare.", "Luckily, my kids weren\u2019t there for that conversation. They don\u2019t need to know that their grandparents suggested something like that.", "I suggested it since you were concerned about your health. Having someone else carry him, even now when you are still able to, might make the trips more enjoyable for the both of you, just guessing. There might be care assistant agencies (I don't know the right term) who could match you up with somebody able to safely assist. \n\nSomething else I just thought of:  Have you been able to find any kind of vacation destinations that are more geared towards your son's needs but still kind of fit in that \"eco-tourism\" vibe your in-laws want? Especially with them getting older, it would seem they'd try to find things to do that don't always involve a Bear Grylls mindset.\n\nAnyhow, I don't see how anyone could expect you to just leave your son behind. I hope you are able to work something out.", "What about hiring 2 people to carry him? Or you and another person? \n\nAlso, i didn't interpret the suggestion to hire a babysitter as him being confined to a room. When i babysat, I would take the kids out to do things or bring entertaining activities for them to do. Parents can rotate staying with the son (and sitter if one is needed) and the other can look after the daughter.\n\nRegardless of their physical abilities, your kids are different people with varying interests. My dad would take my brothers out to do guy stuff and my mom and I would do what we (which really means \"I\" ... Lol) wanted to do. If i wanted to do the same thing but at my level, my mom would have taken me and we would do that.", "If I had a disabled grandson, I'd plan vacations around him, not try to fit him into my life somewhere. Easy for me to say, because I don't even have kids. But still....", "Out of curiosity...\n\nWhat are your reservations about your daughter travelling out of country with her grandparents & other family? From what you've said it seems as though there would be ample adults around to supervise.\n\n\nMy 2\u00a2...\n\nI did a bunch of travelling out of country with my grandparents as a child starting ~ age 8, hell I flew home from Europe essentially alone at age 9 & 11, I would absolutely consider letting her go on these trips. \n\n\nAnyways.\n\nGood luck.", "There are a lot of adults on the trip, she is the only child they are looking after, and presumably they care about her. So 13-14 yo seems capable of not wandering off and doing what she is told so IMHO she would be fine (if she is a typical 8th grader). Heck, she's going to be in high school next year. But you're the parent so your rules.\n\nIf you are going to say no to this opportunity (assuming she wants to go), at least tell her at what age or under what conditions she is allowed to go. \n\nIf she does a trip with the extended family, you can still plan a family trip for the 4 of you. It's not like she'll be missing the family trip.\n\nDo you feel she already spends enough time with her brother? Does she get to do things without him?", "My concerns are that she is a 13-year-old lesbian, and there are a lot of places where she would not be safe if they knew that about her. In addition, I am concerned about the idea of her being in a hotel room by herself. I am concerned about the fact that my in-laws are elderly, and while they try, they would not be able to keep up with a 13-year-old. My SIL and BIL and their significant others have no children, and they\u2019re not the most responsible people.", "She does get to do things without her brother. She is doing a musical theater camp for two weeks this summer (at her choice). She is also going to Pride in NYC with her aunts.  She and I do taekwondo together twice a week, she and my wife like to go thrift store shopping, and are actually out doing that right now. We try to make sure that we spend at least an hour or two each week with each kid without the other parent and without the other kid.\n\nQuite honestly, the no leaving the country thing is probably more of a hangup of mine.", "Well, again just my 2\u00a2\n\nIf the trip includes somewhere a lesbian isn't safe, she'd not be measurably safer with you than without. \n\nShe's 13.... Not 3.... And probably doesn't need a leash. If she's even remotely responsible and you can have a somewhat adult conversation with her, the door is open to some very serious discussions about how to behave/etc that would quite possibly open the door to her travelling with the above-mentioned family members. E/\n\nWhen you say SIL/BIL/SOs 'are not the most responsible people'.... Are we talking like a few extra glasses of wine at night when the kids are in bed, or let's rip LSD in the jungle around some kids? At 13 there's only so much looking after they'd really need to do (imo)\n\n\n\nAnyways,\nGood luck.\n\nBut I'd very seriously consider keeping the door open to letting your daughter go on these trips. You can discuss it with her all you want, but avoiding some resentment for her being held back from these experiences will likely still prove extremely difficult.", "With the SIL, and BIL, it is more alcohol than anything.  They all tend to get plastered every night when we go on vacation. When they get drunk, their decision making is not optimal, and their discussion topics are certainly not something that I want my 13-year-old to be exposed to.", "Pro tip: your 13yr old has probably heard it all, and more, already. So I'd really really not factor that into your decision.", "NTA", "Why can\u2019t your daughter go with your ILs while you and your son do something else entirely? These sound like really special trips and she shouldn\u2019t have to miss out. NAH.", "NTA it\u2019s totally understandable that these types of holidays are unsuitable for your family.\n\nit would be cruel to make your son stay with a babysitter while you are all out having fun. Your in-laws lack empathy.\n\nAs for your daughter missing out, while it might be nice and enjoyable to do activities that her brother unfortunately can\u2019t, she will survive. Lots of children don\u2019t experience this type of holiday, your daughter has the rest of her life to travel and experience the world.\n\nFind a holiday destination that will suit your wife, daughter, son and yourself.", "NTA.\n\n  You did exactly the right thing. There are places with adaptive kayaking, trails for his scooter, and water sports for kids like him. (A friend used an online agency-*Wheel the World* I think-to plan a trip, which might be an option for you.)\n\n  Your in laws sound like they \"mean well,\" but are clueless about what is appropriate for your son. If they're not willing to learn/adapt\\~I'd skip the Family Vacation with them, TBH.", "NTA, however I do feel there is a solution with the Grandpa hanging out with him. So if y\u2019all are doing something neither in them can do, he gets some nice bonding with him.", "Nta if your son was a type 1 diabetic would they think it was ok to plan vacations to candy factories with tastings where he could barely partake?", "> I do not feel comfortable sending her out of the country with my inlaws. There are just too many issues.\n\nSeeing how they are willing to leave people behind I think you're right with this.", "It\u2019s okay to not want to stop doing more extreme outdoor pursuits because one person can\u2019t do them. It\u2019s not ableist.", "I didn't say it was ableist. But they're family. Just saying.", "Again, I'm only speaking from a position of having done some similar travelling at a similar age.\n\nBeing given the freedom/trust/responsibility by my parents was a really good feeling and definitely helped me be more responsible", "There is a difference between her having heard or seen things that she should not be exposed to at her age, and having respected adults in her life, expose her to those same things. Just because she has seen or heard about sex and TV or movies, does not mean that she should hear her aunts and uncle talk about it. just because she has seen people act drunk on TV or movies, does not mean that she should witness respected adults behaving like that.", "We have given her quite a bit of freedom, respect, and trust. She is doing a two week musical theater camp at a  college in another town. She is also doing a trip to New York City by herself to visit her aunts and go to the more family friendly stuff at youth Pride.", "INFO: have you ever talked to your daughter in a very non-confrontational way about this? She\u2019s plenty old enough to have feelings about this.", "NTA - But maybe an option would be for your daughter to go with one of the other family members, that way she doesn\u2019t feel held back and can enjoy all of the physical activities.  I don\u2019t know if that is really an option, but may be something to explore.", "NTA.  If not everyone in the family can participate, it's not a \"family\" vacation.", "Your in-laws need to decide if they\u2019re taking a vacation with family or a family vacation. Sometimes it\u2019s okay to go and do things that are specific to one person\u2019s interest, that another person can\u2019t or won\u2019t do. But generally speaking? It should be, at most, like 1 activity/day on a vacation. The fact that they\u2019re consistently choosing places and activities that disinclude your son means there\u2019s either selfishness or bigotry underlying this. Do they make other remarks? Has your son ever complained about things they\u2019ve said to him? \n\nIncidentally, could the in-laws be targeting *you?* If you\u2019re doing most of the lifting in this relationship, heh, could they be purposefully sabotaging your back or your participation?", "Nta \n\nBased on your comment, your daughter doesn\u2019t even particularly want to go. As far as I can tell, there isn\u2019t really a problem. Choose a vacation that your whole family can participate in and enjoy. Let the in laws do your thing. If they want you there they can plan something accessible.", "I\u2019ve been asked to talk to her repeatedly.  I talked to her this evening.  She told me: \n\n> \u201cI\u2019m more of a city girl. I\u2019m not really excited about the idea of being out in the middle of nowhere without air conditioning.\u201d", "You said that your FIL sits out some activities; do you think that he and your son could sit them out together, or does your son need more help than your FIL could handle? It might be a nice bonding time.", "Sure but why limit their daughter?", "NTA but he does need to learn he there will be things he can\u2019t do that others can but so does your daughter we all do. With that being said find someone to Stay with him at home and have activities planned.", "You had me at lodges that aren\u2019t accessible for your son. NTA.", "Definitely NTA. There are all sorts of vacations you can take where your son can be an active participant, or at least active half the time. If you want to continue the extended family vacations, maybe propose some ideas to the inlaws?", "NTA If they want to do family vacations with these sort of activities, they need to look into ones that will accommodate your entire family. I have to think out there are experiences and excursions that cater to people with varying mobility issues, especially children. Something like that might be a great experience for everyone, and no one would feel excluded.\nAnother option may be to let your daughter go on some of those other, more physically demanding vacations with the family, while you and your wife take your son somewhere special for him? Not every time, but maybe once in a while?", "NTA. Absolutely NTA.", "Agreed, NTA.\n\nThe weird thing is, it doesn\u2019t sound like it would even be that hard to accommodate the son. They could still go on a family vacation to the tropics if they chose something a bit less rugged.\n\nGo somewhere with beaches and wide packed trails nearby. Botanical gardens, restaurants, open air markets, etc. all places an [all terrain wheelchair](https://www.rehabmart.com/product/hippocampe-beach-and-allterrain-wheelchair-45660.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAxbefBhDfARIsAL4XLRoUs0K9PRunnrG6ZDbWLhUa_lThIhR66NkWYYmT3uFsrZ9IwyEo4gcaAlr2EALw_wcB) can go. There are a lot of options out there than can accommodate.", "I'm with you.\n\nOP's son is going to face so many situations where he can't participate, or can't participate fully. His life is going to be harder. Of all the people on this earth, *his own family* should not be working to reinforce his differences and highlight his disabilities, but rather seeking out ways to include him. OP's edit, where he says his in-laws just aren't used to thinking about this, made me even more angry; ***why the hell aren't they thinking about this??*** They can't possibly be so blind that they can't tell their grandson is growing, and they must surely be aware that carrying a larger child is harder than carrying a small one; they are apparently sufficiently well-off to be able to afford these grand vacations, so presumably they are sufficiently capable of basic reasoning that they were able to earn good livings. So if they're not too stupid to understand the problem, then the only option left is that they are shockingly thoughtless and lacking in empathy.", "It\u2019s not hard to find a place that works for everyone and gives options for different activities.  There is plenty of eco tourism in areas with hotels that are accessible to everyone and has other activists, a pool, etc.", "NAH. Even if commendable you are taking a stand for your family, reality is that soon these activities will be impossible for him and you lifestyle will have to adapt to it, your in laws have no ill intentions apparently so maybe is time your family take turns to organize or investigates a trip that can satisfy everyone.", "It sounds like you are making sure she gets to lead a normal childhood and isn't constantly held back because of her brother. Is there a reason she can't \"do it all\" and go on this trip with one parent and also go on the real family trip that you plan? \n\nYou're NTA because as a parent you decide what is best for your kids. It's just foreign to me that you don't trust her grandparents or her aunt and uncle to make sure she is safe and will have a good time. She has a cell phone and can call and tell you if she's being neglected, can't she? When our local high school band and choir go to Europe, it's 1 parent to 6-10 kids. THAT is something I'd worry about. \n\nNow, if you want to make a point to your in-laws, that's a different story. Or maybe you want to make sure the kids bond more. Or maybe you want your extended family to spend more time with your son. (Are they nice to him at Christmas and on his birthday? Do they include him in festivities? If they normally do, and it's only once a year on this big vacation that they don't make sure he can participate in ALL activities, then NAH. Vacations are expensive so they should see and do what they want. The fact that they are inviting you and paying for everything is extremely generous. I don't think you should be dictating what their bucket list should be. They have much less time to check things off.)", "nta - your turn to plan the trip.", "I have 7 grandchildren and I can not for one moment imagine planning something that excluded one of them. It would be one thing if it were the occasional trip and others were inclusive. But always being odd man out. I'm sorry but that is horrible. Shame on them.", "Yta. Don\u2019t hold your daughter back. She will rightfully resent you and brother will be caught in the crossfire. Let her go alone or take separate vacations sometimes and other inclusive ones YOU plan", "NTA \n\nKeep being a good advocate for your son. I lost my ability to walk last year due to a neurological condition and it about broke me being wheelchair bound when I used to be able bodied. Im still not better. He needs you in his corner advocating for his needs. Its hard to realize how much is inaccessible without having lived it or advocated for someone who does.\n\nMaybe take the time they were planning for the vacation and do something all inclusive for your whole family (if you can afford it). Or just pick some nice accessible museums/day trips to do together. He appreciates the effort and that way your daughter can spend time with you as a family as well. Versus having parents take turns. \n\nBest of luck!", "NTA but it\u2019s definitely time to stop participating in these family vacations. You definitely need to protect your own body. Your daughter is another problem by itself. You\u2019re right to not want her to miss out on these activities. And you\u2019re being good parents by not putting her last behind your son. You can compromise and let her go on half of them a year. If they only go once a year, allow her to go with. If it\u2019s the half of them a year explain that it\u2019s not fair to your son for her to go to all of them and it\u2019s not fair to her for her not to be able to go at all."]}
