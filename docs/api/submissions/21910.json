I feel it might make me an ass hole because that\u2019s kind of a dick move and is ass hole like if me to tell her who she can and can\u2019t hangout with.

I can understand the anxiety it may cause, maybe have a conversation with her about how it makes you feel", "INFO: How do you know he still likes her? Has he disrespected her relationships in the past?", "Yeah NTA. I've seen/read a lot of shit where this goes bad. All it takes is one bad fight and some sweet words/gaslighting. This guy has one goal and that's to be with her. Idk how long you've been with your gf, that may or may not help make a difference, but you can at least explain your stance to her and go from there.", "NTA. Is this something you can't handle? (Many people can't and its okay). You can't make her stop, but you can ask her to by explaining your situation. If she refuses, then you have a choice to make. Do I suck it up? Do I leave? Only you know the answer. There is no right or wrong answer here.", "I see a lot of people saying \"YTA - she's not a possession\" like you wouldn't know that. \nOf course OP is not forbidding shit, he's just in an uncomfortable situation. People forget that it's not toxic to communicate your feelings. \n\nDUDE, you are NTA.

I was kind of in the same situation before my now husband and I had started dating and I voiced my concerns about one his friends who liked to cross lines. I wasn't comfortable with him hanging out with her but I was fine with him talking to her. They're still friends to this day.  \n\n\nTell her how you're feeling right now and see what she says then go from there, because if she still stays friends with him and it makes you uncomfortable that may or may not cause issues down the line.", "NTA. If it was just a middle school boyfriend, you\u2019d have a pretty big issue with insecurities, but since the dude still likes your gf and is trying to get with her, you\u2019re totally justified to not want her hanging around him. It\u2019s good that she respects your feelings abt it, cuz if she didn\u2019t and continued to be hanging out with someone who has made it clear they have strong feelings for her, that\u2019s be really disrespectful to you as her bf", "NTA. It's rather an uncomfortable situation. Communicate your issues and tell her you'd feel better if she didn't spend time with an ex who still likes her but don't be an a s s about it.", "NTA, dump the GF and let him have her.", "Yta. So what if he likes her? If she doesn't like him, you should trust her to remain faithful and be able to enjoy hanging out with her friend. They dated in middle school, it's so long ago and truthfully didn't matter at that age anyway, so it's irrelevant.", "YTA\n\nBecause she's not a possession to be owned but a prize to be won and so are you. She cheats on you? So what? She wasn't good enough for you then. Yeah, cheating is a disrespectful and hurtful thing, but so is jealousy. \n\nAre you going to lock her away every time a man shows interest? You need to trust she chose you and wants to be with you. If she can't be respectful or trustworthy - controlling her won't change that - she'll then just lie to you about what she's doing and who she's with. What kind of relationship is that? \n\nEither have confidence and respect *for yourself* or don't be in this relationship because you're not ready for it.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to tell another adult who they can or cannot hang out with.\n\nYou could tell her about your feelings of jealousy and having a tough time dealing with that, but stop trying to control her actions.", "YTA LMFAO you\u2019re jealous because they \u201cdated\u201d in middle school. This is just silly. They\u2019re friends and have been sense at least middle school, get over it.", "YTA - You can't tell her not to hang out with him.

She might not mean to be doing that, but every time she agrees to talk with him or go out with him keeps his hope alive.  Her just talking with him or hanging out could even be holding him back from finding someone else.", "She asked and you replied honestly. That's how relationships last a long time. There will be times where you will also have to make some sacrifices for her. Whether your or her sacrifice is good or not is none of anyone's business.", "OK, fair enough.  Tell her to stop seeing him without you, that is a fair boundary.  If she refuses, then there is more to it then friendship.", "That's right - she is her own human being which means she has to manage her own relationships like ending the friendship with this man if he can't have unromantic feelings for her, but that's her choice. \n\nShe has to realize whether or not this person is an actual friend or disguises his motivations as such, but you can't do that for her.

You\u2019re a TEAM and when your teammate tells you something is bothering them you listen and work towards a solution together. Not once did he say that he TOLD HER to do anything.

What you are describing is a way to put an end to a toxic behaviour but the onus is definitely on him to leave", "Agree to disagree. If she considers someone who is actively trying to pursue her and disrespecting her feelings and current relationship a \u201cfriend\u201d, then she\u2019s part of the problem. That\u2019s not a friend, and she should recognise that. The onus doesn\u2019t lie entirely with either one of them to be fair. He should take the hint and leave, she should recognise that he doesn\u2019t seem to be taking the hint and take matters into her own hands. They\u2019re both just as bad."]}
