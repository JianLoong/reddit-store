{"id": 32020, "submission_id": "1876lwe", "title": "AITA for not defending my wife wanting to attend a funeral with our baby, thus causing her to miss it?", "selftext": " My wife and I have a 6-month-old baby girl. Due to postpartum anxiety, which she is being treated for, my wife struggles with leaving our daughter with anyone outside myself or my mother, who lives with us. This hasn\u2019t been an issue thus far and as I said, she\u2019s in therapy so little by little, it\u2019s been getting better.\n\nUnfortunately, my nephew (who was also 6 months old) passed away a few weeks ago. He had been in poor health since birth but it\u2019s still obviously devastating for the entire family, especially my brother and SIL. They held the services the following weekend.\n\nI was in consistent contact with my brother and we were discussing the funeral. He said he knew it was a lot to ask, but could we please not bring our daughter. I said I completely understood and didn\u2019t even intend to. One, in my opinion, babies do not belong at funerals. Two, this is a funeral for a baby of a similar age. Why would one want to bring up that reminder? My brother said he knows how my wife is about leaving the baby so they understand if she can\u2019t come.\n\nWell, my wife became irritated when she found out I \u201cdidn\u2019t defend her\u201d. She reminded me that she doesn\u2019t trust anyone to take care of the baby outside me and my mom, who obviously have to be at the funeral. She doesn\u2019t want to miss it either, but also won\u2019t agree to leave the baby with anyone else. We have several family members on her side that we are close to, as well as good friends who also have kids. I said even if she just went to the service and not the gathering afterward, that\u2019d just be an hour. She said no, she can\u2019t handle the thought of leaving her with anyone else. I said that\u2019s understandable and that clearly, my brother and SIL would rather her not come if it means not having a baby at the funeral. She continued to complain.\n\nFinally, I said she has two choices and she needs to make one, I don\u2019t care which it is. I won\u2019t\u2019 hold it against her either way. One, either allow someone else to watch the baby for an hour. Two, stay home with the baby. She says that I\u2019m not even pretending to be on her side and I said I\u2019m not, because this isn\u2019t even about us.\n\nMy wife ended up staying home with the baby. When my mother and I returned later that afternoon, she shut us both out. Eventually, she calmed down but she has made comments here and there making it clear that she feels I should\u2019ve tried to convince my brother to let the baby come.

You did the right thing.\n\nAnyone who has an ounce of empathy would understand your child's presence would be incredibly hurtful to the grieving parents (and others).  It is difficult to believe she could not look past her wanting to attend with her child.\n\nAsk her to bring this topic to her therapy session (? I'm assuming this is part of her PPD support). Also, hang in there...PPD can be challenging for all involved. Keep in mind that if she is in counseling it is OK to ask her if you can attend a session to learn additional ways to support her and confirm with the your wife and therapist what approaches are working.\n\nBest to you and my condolences regarding the loss of your nephew. Grieve...support and celebrate him. We  cannot predict when pain and loss will enter our lives or upon those we love.", "NTA, not just that you are respecting your brother\u2019s wishes, but I don\u2019t think attending the funeral for a baby of a similar age is going to be good for your wife\u2019s PPA/PPD. She already is afraid to leave the baby alone, she doesn\u2019t need to see what a funeral for a baby looks like\u2026 that sounds like it will make her anxiety worse.", "Hey OP, NTA. I had PPA, it\u2019s shit for everyone involved (the person, their partner, anyone trying to understand it from the outside). You did absolutely everything right. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s not seeing through the fog of it right now to understand she was entirely without empathy for your grieving brother\u2019s situation. I\u2019m also sorry you were put in a position to feel like you even needed to post this. \n\nPPD can happen to dads too. Please take care of yourself and check in every once in a while on your own mental health - you deserve support during this too. I hope she mentions this in her own therapy.", "NTA.  You were exactly right - if her PPA made her unable to leave the baby with someone else, the only reasonable option left was not coming.  If the loss had been on her side of the family, it would have made more sense for your mother or even you to watch the baby so she could be with her sibling.  As it was your side of the family, your presence and your mother\u2019s presence were more important than hers, so she needed to decide whether she could deal with her anxiety or miss it due to her anxiety.", "Nta, postpartum is no joke and a serious illness. If this is new behavior I would try and be compassionate we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in her head. If she\u2019s expressed selfish anger like this in the past pre baby I would start to pivot from using her postpartum as an excuse for her bad behavior and start communicating how this can\u2019t be tolerated maybe get the therapist involved", "NTA, how on Earth could you go against your brother's wishes? But could one of you attend the service, and the other attendant the Gathering after? That doesn't sound feasible either does it? It's just a really impossible situation.", "NTA. It would have been insensitive of your wife to take the baby to the funeral of a child the same age.\n\nWe should stand by our partners when they are in the right, not not when they are wrong or when their actions would hurt others.", "NTA. Believe it or not, it's best that your wife didn't attend the funeral being in that state of mind. If she can't leave her baby with someone else for just an hour, imagine what mental state she could have been seeing a dead baby. She should be thanking you!", "NTA\n\nThe #1 most important factor is this: \n\nYour brother, who is having a funeral for his infant son, has asked that your baby not be at the funeral. Nothing else matters!", "NTA. Your brother wished the kid not to be there. You were respecting his wishes. \n\nI was of a similar situation when I was a baby. My uncle and aunt had a baby girl the same year I was born. Tragically, the baby passed shortly after birth. I was born 2 weeks later. \n\nI have no pictures of my aunt and I until I was a little bit older, about 2. She was grieving. I was a reminder of the daughter she lost. And that's what she had told my mom.\n\nI don't blame her in the least for not wanting to hold me, especially since her daughter and I would've been so close in age. I don't blame her for not wanting to see me so soon after she lost a daughter. We were the same age, after all. We would've grown up together. She was grieving.\n\nI say this not to take away from your story, but to validate your brother's request and give my own experience.\n\nGrief is not easy. It is messy. Losing a child so young is devastating. Your brother sees his kid in yours - a child who was the same age as his. It's nothing against your child. Your brother isn't taking it out on you and I assume doesn't hate you. And not wanting to see someone while you are grieving is valid. NTA.", "NTA \n\nI get that her anxiety won't let her allow the baby out of sight. Everyone does. That's why your brother and SIL made clear they won't hold it against her if she stayed away. \n\nShe wasn't forced to leave the baby with someone else. She was given a choice. Bringing a baby to the funeral is absolutely not okay. Why would she rhink that her wanting to be there with her child is more important than the feelings of the grieving parents?", "NTA-You were making the funeral about your family\u2019s loss. Your wife was making it about herself.  I\u2019m so sorry for your family\u2019s loss.", "NTA. Your wife has got to realize how hurtful it might be to the parents who lost their child who is similar in age. That\u2019s just so inconsiderate. It\u2019s not like she was missing a party. The husband even specifically mentioned it would be hurtful. Not sure why she would feel that is ok?", "NTA - Your wife needs to understand that the presence of a 6 month old baby at the funeral for a 6 month old baby would be incredibly triggering and insensitive for the parents of the child being remembered.  \n\nWhile I can understand your wife's reluctance to leave your baby in the care of someone else, that is her choice, and that to insist that the child accompany her to the funeral is incredibly insensitive.  You did exactly the right thing in not defending your wife, because that stance is, quite frankly, indefensible.", "NTA. No one should defend anyone who wants to bring a 6-month-old to a 6 month olds funeral. \n\n>She says that I\u2019m not even pretending to be on her side and I said I\u2019m not, because this isn\u2019t even about us.\n\nExactly. Just put it in perspective for her. Might trigger her though, so suggest sitting in on a therapy session to see if her therapist can help her see why or where she's wrong.", "NTA, guess what people, a baby\u2019s funeral is not about you. Whatever the parents want, including everyone showing up in clown shoes is the least you can do.", "So sorry for your families loss. NTA.", "NTA\n\nPost Parfums anxiety is brutal and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  But the anxiety doesn't get to tell others what to do.  \n\nOP you gave her 2 reasonable choices and she made her choice.", "NTA\n\nI understand your wife is ill, and is in therapy, but her attitude was very unreasonable and her behaviour was poor. \n\nYour brother had 1 request, that you not bring your child.\n\nYou gave her options what more could you do. I thinks she needs more than the therapy she is getting.\n\nI am sorry for your families loss", "NTA. Postpartum anxiety is one thing, but holy shit that is delusional and entitled. \n\nYou were never going to win that battle even if you tried, you'd probably just end up alienating your brother who's going through a lot. I'm sure you tried telling her that you were not going to add anything to the plate of a man who just lost his child, but if she ever brings this up, just tell her to look down at her child that is still alive and healthy and shut the F up.", "NTA.\n\nYou are COMPLETELY RATIONAL here.\n\nBringing a baby to another babies funeral would just be cruel, plus your right that babies don't belong at funerals anyway.\n\nIf your wife's still making comments, ask her how it would feel if the shoe was on the other foot. If she could just imagine, even for a second what it would be like for there to be another 6 month old at her 6 month olds funeral. \n\nNow, I'm not one for there was an incident, leave them, but you might really wanna have a serous conversation with your wife about some compassion and empathy, or just tell her straight up to drop it. Because there was no way, shape, or form that you were wrong here.\n\nGood for you for not adding this whole thing on top of all the sh\\*t that life's thrown your brother way lately.", "NTA, any request that a grieving family makes should be honored.", "NTA.  Such a tough situation but does your wife REALLY want you to tell the grieving parents that her baby should be allowed? I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nFirst, you have my deepest, heartfelt condolences. The pain your brother and SIL are in is indescribable and debilitating. I'm glad that your brother has you to help keep him from being swallowed by that darkness. \n\nAlso - I've been to funerals of tiny little babies. It's soul crushing. \ud83d\udc94 I don't think it would have been advisable or healthy for your wife to go at all. And it would've been an AH move for her to take the baby. PPA is horrible, but that's selfish beyond the pale. It would have only added to your brother's & Sil's devastation. \nGood luck \ud83c\udf39 I'm sending you light & love for peace and strength.", "NTA. She needs to understand the only relevant feelings in this situation is that of the grieving parents. Not everything is about her. Her entitlement is appalling!", "What torture it would be to see this healthy baby at this particular funeral. Your wife needs to learn to let others protect their own emotional health as she is protecting hers. She is being totally self centered and unreasonable. YNTA. Your wife has some serious issues. I hope she gets a handle on them soon. Eventually this baby will grow up. Is she going to sit in the classroom when the baby goes off to school?", "NTA. Your wife is a HUUUUUGE one, though. \n\nIf she can't pull her head out of her own butt enough to have any shred of sympathy for someone who is burying an infant, her opinion really doesn't matter. At all.\n\nGod.", "NTA. Grieving parents supersede anxious aunt.", "NTA- as a mom, I can't even imagine how heartbreaking it would be to be burying a child and have another one of roughly same age/appearance come to the funeral.  You did the right thing.  Hopefully, your wife will be able to get past her issues and empathise with the family's lose.", "NTA. PPA is one thing. But your wife is so *selfish*. There is no \"her side\" and nothing to defend her from. She wasn't being excluded, she was being *accommodated*. And, more than that, your brother and SIL were *gracious* in understanding that your wife may not be there to support *them*. You know, the ones who actually lost their child, who probably wish they were missing \"family\" events to care for their child, or having family babysit them.", "NTA. Your wife has the empathy of a sea sponge and, in this scenario, comes across as shockingly self absorbed.", "NTA you handled it well, I hope her mental health continues to improve.", "NTA - Bringing a reminder of their child to the funeral is in poor taste.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Post partum anxiety or not, wishes of the deceased's parents need to be respected.", "Her mental issues must be much larger than you're showing here if she is so out of touch with reality to think that the grieving parents would be okay with a baby of the same age there while their little one is in a coffin in the ground.", "NTA. I think she is stunningly selfish and insensitive. Fine if she didn\u2019t want to go but the dramatics are over the top.", "Nta.\n\nYou were right. This wasn't about her, or defending her  AT ALL. It was about complying with the wishes of grieving parents.\n\nThis a problem for therapy, not you.", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t about your wife. This is about supporting your brother and his wife and honoring their deceased infant.", "OP NTA. Your wife thinks this song is about her. It isn't. And while I empathize with your wife, it would have been absolutely heartless to bring your baby to the funeral of a baby, and that's completely aside the fact that they're the same age, and who knows how loud she might have been. LORT, that would have just been cruel. My deepest condolences to your family.", "NTA\n\nYou had it exactly right: this funeral to mark the tragic passing of a baby the same age as yours is not about you. \n\nOf course you should not have leaned on your brother to let your wife attend holding your very alive baby. \n\nI cannot imagine the grief the bereaved parents must be feeling. I cannot imagine a more cruel way to rub in everything they lost when their baby died than to have your baby at his graveside  \n\nThank God you stopped your wife from bringing your baby girl to her cousins funeral. \n\nI hope that once her postpartum anxiety has eased your wife re-finds some empathy. And shows some compassion.\n\nMy consolation on your family's loss. I hope you find peace. And I wish you all well.", "NTA. i feel for your wife and the anxiety she's going through, and i get that she doesn't want to leave your daughter with someone else. but i'd hope she would understand why bringing the baby to the funeral would not be welcome and that it isn't anything against her personally. it's about respecting your brother and SIL and their wishes. trying to talk your brother into letting her bring the baby after he specifically said he didn't want that would have been uncool and selfish.", "NTA. If theres a reason to miss a funeral, this is it", "NTA Your wife is being very selfish. The funeral was for your brother and sil who are grieving the death of their child. It wasn't for your wife or even your other family members since the baby was so young. That she doesn't understand that shows an utter lack of empathy.", "NTA. That would be too cruel to your brother and SIL. Why doesn\u2019t your wife trust anyone from her side of the family to watch baby for an hour? Are there abuse issues? I think in this case, staying home from the funeral was the correct choice. Condolences to your brother, SIL and family, that\u2019s such a tragic thing to happen.", "NTA.  Your baby\u2019s presence at the funeral would have been more hurtful than your wife\u2019s presence could ever have been comforting, and you should explain it to her that way.", "There is nothing to \u2018defend\u2019. This is a request of grieving parents and they come first at their own child\u2019s funeral", "She can talk about it with her therapist.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What part of 'Do not bring a baby to someone else's baby's funeral' is she not getting? Does she think your brother and SIL are just gonna be cool with seeing your wife holding her baby?", "NTA but your wife is. Your brother just lost his baby FFS. How your wife could be so selfish to think that bringing her baby to the funeral is appropriate is beyond me.\n\nAlso, she needs therapy if she is incapable of leaving her child for even an hour. That's not healthy.", "You wife is an AH", "NTA. How can your wife who is terrified of something happening to your baby in any way think that it's appropriate to bring her baby to another child's funeral? It's mind-boggling and cruel. You absolutely did the right thing by not trying to convince your brother to let you bring your healthy baby to their baby's funeral.", "You are not the asshole, and good on you for protecting your brother and SILs (very reasonable) wishes.\n\nHowever, I have a hard time called a woman in the middle of her own mental health crisis, an asshole .  Your wife's words and actions are very assholish with a hefty dose of cold and selfish, tbf.  However, she may not be capable of most in this moment.  Sure, she is being treated for ppa, but treatment isn't a magic wand that makes everything better instantly. Sometimes it straight up ineffective.\n\nStill, you did the absolute right thing, even if your wife is feeling betrayed.  That's her emotion to figure out, but again, gotta mention that might be a bigger challenge than \"get over it\" for her.\n\noverall, reluctant NTA\n\nSorry for you family's loss.", "Nta. She can\u2019t see it now but taking your baby would have been cruel to the people who lost theirs.", "It\u2019s not about you wifey!", "NTA. not only would that be so devastating for them to see your baby and be reminded of probably the worst heartache a person could ever experience, but how is your wife ever going to function? will she just never ever leave the baby with anyone? it\u2019s not healthy. i know she\u2019s struggling postpartum, but she still needs to be held responsible to not let that have such negative affects on your lives. \n\nso sorry for yall loss.", "NTA. I didn't leave my babies with anyone due to exclusively breast feeding. However, I would have put myself in the grieving parents shoes and been sensitive enough to not bring my same age baby even if that meant me staying home.", "NTA. Bringing the child to that funeral would just have been extremely cruel and selfish. It would have been done entirely just for your wife, and that day was absolutely not about her.\nYou presented her with two realistic, viable options and she didn't like any of them. That's on her. Not you.", "My condolences", "Years ago. my best friend had a baby at 7 months along, and he died. Her SIL brought her 8 month old to the funeral, and of course he cried and screamed and her SIL - who was an attention hog - made no move to take the kid to the car.  So my poor friend spent her whole child's funeral listening to someone else'a baby cry.  SMH.", "Easy NTA here. The grieving parents have to take priority.", "Nta.\n\nShe should be thankful her child is living and let it go.", ">She reminded me that she doesn\u2019t trust anyone to take care of the baby outside me and my mom\n\nAt which point you remind her (kindly) that she's in therapy because of this. \n\nNo one expects someone to run a marathon with a broken leg, they need to heal first. And you don't shorten the marathon or make everyone wait at the finish line while they hop on their crutches across the finish line. You wife is still in her healing process, and yes, that means that she might miss out on this she really wants to do. But until she's at a point where she can trust your son with someone else, that's her reality. The work and healing is *hers* to do.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but your wife certainly is. A baby has no place at a funeral. The fact that this was another infants funeral makes that even more of a hard no. Your wife is absolutely inconsiderate and her anxiety has created this situation.

That her feelings are irrelevant in this situation. Be blunt.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her needs and her behavior was quite cold and cruel to the bereaved parents. And now she is being an ass to a grieving grandma? There was nothing to defend. Here behavior was and is atrocious.", "Your wife\u2019s lack of self awareness and empathy is appalling. Postpartum anxiety is no excuse for her callous disregard for the loss that your bother and wife have suffered. Then she has the audacity to have a stank ass attitude with you and your mom after you come back from a funeral for a baby? She\u2019s fucking awful.  News flash it\u2019s not about her.", "NTA. I hesitate to call your wife an AH when she's legitimately struggling and seeking help, but her unwillingness to empathize with your brother and SIL is pretty shitty.

Hopefully your wife will discuss this in therapy and get some clarity.", "My deepest condolences on your loss.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA\n\nIt would be unforgivably CRUEL to bring the child.\n\nYour wife needs to develop some compassion.

You absolutely did the right thing. Taking the baby would have been unbearably cruel. \n\nI understand that your wife is ill and that her illness is making her irrational. I strongly suggest that you request either a joint session with her therapist or that you send the therapist a letter explaining your wife's behavior surrounding the funeral. The therapist needs to be aware that your wife is ill to the point where she is being cruel, even if it is inadvertent. The more info the therapist has, the better they can support your wife to getting back to her rational self.", "NTA. She's being irrational as well as unempathetic toward your brother and SIL.

I understand both sides, my judgement is a bit skewed as someone who\u2019s also six months postpartum, has dealt with anxiety, and has dealt with loss as well: I literally irrationally HATED anyone who announced they were pregnant (which seemed like everyone on earth) when I had my miscarriage (you\u2019re grieving, you\u2019re jealous, and you\u2019re wondering what the frick did i do to deserve this devastation), so of course your brother and SIL wouldn\u2019t want to see a baby at their baby\u2019s services. My baby is six, almost seven, months old and I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle going to a funeral for a child her age. I also understand not wanting to leave baby, it\u2019s extremely hard.

Due to postpartum anxiety, which she is being treated for, my wife struggles with leaving our daughter with anyone outside myself or my mother, who lives with us. This hasn\u2019t been an issue thus far and as I said, she\u2019s in therapy so little by little, it\u2019s been getting better.\n\nUnfortunately, my nephew (who was also 6 months old) passed away a few weeks ago. He had been in poor health since birth but it\u2019s still obviously devastating for the entire family, especially my brother and SIL. They held the services the following weekend.\n\nI was in consistent contact with my brother and we were discussing the funeral. He said he knew it was a lot to ask, but could we please not bring our daughter. I said I completely understood and didn\u2019t even intend to. One, in my opinion, babies do not belong at funerals. Two, this is a funeral for a baby of a similar age. Why would one want to bring up that reminder? My brother said he knows how my wife is about leaving the baby so they understand if she can\u2019t come.\n\nWell, my wife became irritated when she found out I \u201cdidn\u2019t defend her\u201d. She reminded me that she doesn\u2019t trust anyone to take care of the baby outside me and my mom, who obviously have to be at the funeral. She doesn\u2019t want to miss it either, but also won\u2019t agree to leave the baby with anyone else. We have several family members on her side that we are close to, as well as good friends who also have kids. I said even if she just went to the service and not the gathering afterward, that\u2019d just be an hour. She said no, she can\u2019t handle the thought of leaving her with anyone else. I said that\u2019s understandable and that clearly, my brother and SIL would rather her not come if it means not having a baby at the funeral. She continued to complain.\n\nFinally, I said she has two choices and she needs to make one, I don\u2019t care which it is. I won\u2019t\u2019 hold it against her either way. One, either allow someone else to watch the baby for an hour. Two, stay home with the baby. She says that I\u2019m not even pretending to be on her side and I said I\u2019m not, because this isn\u2019t even about us.\n\nMy wife ended up staying home with the baby. When my mother and I returned later that afternoon, she shut us both out. Eventually, she calmed down but she has made comments here and there making it clear that she feels I should\u2019ve tried to convince my brother to let the baby come.

I opened this expecting it must be that you were demanding she leave the baby but you weren\u2019t. You presented reasonable options. She didn\u2019t come up with any other than bringing a same-age baby when the family asked that no baby be present.", "NTA... the 2 choices were both reasonable.  Because is having post partum, all you can do is hope the doctors and your support will get her better", "NTA- she\u2019s the AH for not wanting to respect the losing families wishes. If she can\u2019t trust people yet, to watch her kid, that\u2019s her problem\u2026 I suspect we\u2019ll hear from you two when you get a no kids/babies invite to a wedding. Also not your choice\u2026 the universe doesn\u2019t cater to you regardless of any of your conditions. There\u2019s no ADA for real life. May want to look into professional help.", "NTA. You did the right thing.  Thank you. I know she has PPA but damn. Did that make her lose all empathy?", "NTA", "NTA definitely do not bring babies to the funeral for a baby. I admit I did love cuddling some of my friends\u2019 babies at my mom\u2019s funeral. She loved kids too so it was different.", "NTA. Your wife is being completely unreasonable in wanting to take a baby to the funeral of a baby that was the same age.", "NTA. as someone else suggested, this is definitely something she needs to talk with therapist about.", "NTA - you absolutely did the right thing. This isn\u2019t a scenario where she needed to be \u201cdefended,\u201d and respecting your brother and SIL\u2019s wishes during such an incredibly difficult time for them takes precedent over her comfort in this situation. I am so sorry for your loss, and I am glad to hear your wife is seeking help and has support for her PPA.", "NTA You are correct, the funeral isn't about you, your wife or your child. Your wife just ran into the first big decision she had that her issues are causing her to have to make. You and your brother did not cause this. It won't be the last if she doesnt get past this. I hope her therapy helps soon.\n\nEdit: for bad autocorrect", "NTA. This funeral has nothing to do with her, yet she\u2019s acting like it\u2019s super important that she\u2019s there.

I feel bad for you.", "Nta.\n\nYour wife wants you to defend her and take her side? Seriously? She doesn't have a side here, the only side that exists is supporting the grieving parents.

As others have suggested encourage your wife to talk about this in therapy, she needs a serious reality check.", "NTA, you wife need extreme medical help ASAP. You have carte blanch to support your brother. Wife needs help.", "NTA. The funeral is not a time for her to argue about bringing the baby or \"defending\" her choices. It's about supporting the parents who just suffered an unimaginable loss. Given the age of the child that passed away, it's inappropriate and cruel to expect to bring another baby. The two options you gave are really the only two appropriate solutions that allow for 1. Acknowledging that your wife is afraid to leave your baby, and 2. Respecting the wishes of the parents holding the funeral.", "NTA. your wife needs to go talk to her therapist about this\nShes completely out of line.\nAnyone could see how hurtful your healthy babies presence would be to the grieving parents.\nYour wife can't see past herself.\nI don't know if this is how she normally is or if it's part of her PPD.  either way  your wife is TAH here not you.\nDeepest sympathy on the passing of your nephew.", "NTA your wife made this about her. Can she not see how much hurt bringing your baby would cause?!", "NTA - your wife needs to discuss this with her therapist. This wasn\u2019t about her, or even your daughter. This was about supporting your brother and his wife through one of the worst moments of their life and respecting their wishes. \n\nNormally I believe that the family you make should come before the family you came from\u2026 but this is a very rare exception to that rule!\n\nI am so so sorry for you and your family\u2019s loss.", "NTA. She seems to be treating this like a contest or fight for ultimate validity. The truth is, her situation and theirs are both awful positions. They shouldn\u2019t have to be around a baby. She shouldn\u2019t have to leave her baby behind if she can\u2019t handle it. Their request was fair. You offered fair choices.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine any way you could have done better, but her \u201cchoose a side\u201d approach would definitely make it worse.", "NTA, funerals are not an appropriate place for a baby in general, let alone when it\u2019s a funeral for a baby of the same age.\n\nSomeone brought their baby to my brother\u2019s funeral earlier this year because they said they didn\u2019t want to leave him with any number of family and friends who volunteered to babysit. The baby cried through the whole funeral - while I delivered the eulogy, while my brother performed a heartfelt song, literally the whole time. It was distracting and infuriating during what was already one of the most difficult days of my life.\n\nPlease leave babies at home!", "NTA.. You gave 2 reasonable options. Both were completely her choice. That would have been wrong for you to miss it because of her struggles. I am glad you still went.", "NTA. Also, you lost a nephew and your mom lost a grand baby. Your wife is being terrible to only think of herself.", "NTA Your wife is severely mentally ill. How she handled this event makes me wonder if SHE can be trusted caring for a tiny helpless human. You seriously must treat this like the crisis it is.", "NTA and your wife is illogical and selfish. It\u2019s understandable to not want others to watch your baby. Especially the first one. But to want to bring a baby the same age as the deceased is insensitive", "NTA. *She says that I\u2019m not even pretending to be on her side and I said I\u2019m not, because this isn\u2019t even about us.* You're 100% on point with this. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Why does she want to go to the funeral in the first place? To respectfully show support and honor the deceased. But then, how are you being respectful and honoring the deceased if you can't abide by the wishes of the surviving family? And then pushing the issue onto your brother when they are already grieving their child is gross and selfish.   \n\n\nIt's not a fun party she gets to feel unhappy she got excluded from because she wants her child with her, it's not a social occasion, it's not a spectator sport. She can be mad you didn't defend her, but guess what? Her demand was indefensible.", "NTA, but I would consider couples counseling. Being new parents and dealing with PPD is hard. I assume your wife is in solo therapy (if not she should be) but couples counseling could help aid communications and develope tools to handle disagreements in the future.\nDef NTA though. It is a little odd/concerning that your wife wouldn't respect the fact that this was a funeral for a literal baby and to bring your child of the same/similar age is just a cruel taunt at the parents during what is an unbelievably painful and traumatic time in their lives as they have to bury/say goodbye to their baby.", "NTA this is massively insensitive to the parents. I can\u2019t imagine being a parent and thinking this is ok. I\u2019m so pleased u stood ur ground. I hope yr wife is on the mend", "NTA and if you told her about the parents\u2019 request and she still maintained this position, that doesn\u2019t seem like a logical or typical response. She\u2019s either really selfish then, or not ok. \n\nSorry for your loss and you are doing a great job being the glue right now.", "NTA. as you said, the funeral wasn't about your wife and she needs to understand this was for someone else's pain.", "NTA - she\u2019s prioritizing her own feelings above those of grieving parents, which is breathtaking selfish.", "NTA. She expects everyone to cater to her and her feelings, but can't have enough empathy to understand why the baby can't go.", "NTA. The baby is so close in age I could not imagine how heartbreaking that would be of a reminder. I\u2019m so sorry for this awful loss in your family. \n\nI hope your wife continues to get better. I struggled with postpartum anxiety as well and it\u2019s so damn crazy how it works.", "My gosh wtf is this. Like their baby fucking DIED and she can't get over herself to support her brother in law whose kid just DIED. \n\nHonestly, this is one of the most crazy posts I've read here. Was nauseous just reading this. It's evil.\n\nNTA.", "NTA!! Mom of 2 kids and also not trust anyone enough to watch them yet.  If it was me, I'd be very appreciated towards your brother for being understanding to communicate beforehand and even ok with me missing out on the funeral.  It's completely understandable if they prefer not to be around children of a similar age during such a difficult time. It's the most heart-wrenching experience any parent can go through.  Your wife should know better.  You handled it perfectly fine", "NTA, bordering on NAH. Shes a bit of an AH for the aftermath here, but it was a tough situation with no good answer. I think yall chose the best answer here, and my condolences to all of yall. Yall will get through this.", "NTA with a side of N A H, just because your wife is clearly not thinking clearly. I can\u2019t fathom the pain of the bereaved parents, and I can only assume that your wife\u2019s current display of callous self-centredness is not what she\u2019s normally like", "NTA! I was ready to call you the asshole right up until I read how old your nephew was when he passed. My condolences to your family.", "Nta. How cruel.  The parent of the deceased child asked for the baby not to come. \nAnd she wasn't willingto help out a pair of grieving parents?\nYou made the right call\nShe is not in her right mind right now.  Give her time", "NTA. As you say, babies do not belong at funerals.", "NTA I cannot believe that your wife made this about her, and was insisting on bringing your baby to the funeral for another baby in the family. That is just so indescribably awful.", "Nta. I was confused as to why she couldn\u2019t bring the baby until I read that it was a funeral for a baby. Of course she shouldn\u2019t bring the baby especially as the parents requested you not. You offered two solutions, and as a mom who didn\u2019t have a lot of people I trusted with my kids when they were small I think they were good choices. The funeral wasn\u2019t about her.", "NTA, she is not thinking clearly, when she calms down, she may understand. Like you said it was not about you. Sorry for the loss.", "Most funerals just aren't exactly compatible with babies, even if it wasn't for a baby of a similar age. The best thing is to limit the stress for the grieving family.

Your wife is out of her mind. NTA", "it's really considered a medical condition not to feel comfortable leaving a baby in another person's care at six months?  ..sounds downright rational to me", "NTA. Grieving is about circles of support. The parents of the lost baby are at the heart. Those closest to them are the second ring- their parents siblings etc, should give what support they can without adding more burdens. Then comes the third ring of sibling in laws and other family members and close friends. Fourth would be coworkers or acquaintances, and so on. Always always always outer rings support those inward and try not to add additional burdens. Comfort in, vent out. Your wife needs to see that she isn't the inner ring and that this funeral is not about her. You gave her perfectly fine solutions- leave the baby with a sitter, or since that's not possible with her mental health, stay at home to avoid additionally stressing out grieving parents of a dead baby. The support for the people who lost their baby should be the priority of everyone else.", "NTA of course. You sound like both a wonderful brother and husband. I would tell you to give your wife some grace while dealing with PPA, but you are doing that already \ud83e\udef6 eventually she will realize why she was wrong here.

Right now, the feelings of the grieving parents and the boundaries they set trump her feelings.", "NTA. It would be highly insensitive for you to have your baby there. I\u2019m sorry your wife can\u2019t see it but she\u2019s 100% wrong. Either of the two options were completely acceptable.", "NTA she\u2019s being totally irrational. You have her 2 good solutions while remaining respectful of the funeral. You couldn\u2019t have done anything else without being TA.", "NTA- your brother requested you don't bring your baby, which is not an unreasonable request.", "NTA. She\u2019s wrong, you\u2019re right. The end. It wasn\u2019t the time or the place to \u201cdefend\u201d her and I don\u2019t honestly think there was reason to. The reason for the request was a reasonable and completely understandable one.", "NTA, \nAnd while yes, I fully understand your wife is dealing with a mental health issue,  she's being an AH. Let her know that regardless of her feelings, your brothers and SILs feelings are the ONLY ones that mattered on that day. If she has an issue with that, she should hash it out with her therapist.", "NTA.\n\nThe lead is, obviously, that I'm so, so sorry for the loss of your baby nephew.  I'm not even going to pretend to understand what you and your family are going through.\n\nI'm absolutely amazed that your brother even had the emotional bandwidth to think about your wife at a time like this.  She's being completely unreasonable.  It's a no-brainer not to force your brother and SIL to see a baby who is the same age as their son right now at his funeral.", "NTA, anxiety or not, she needs to put on her big girl panties and respect your brothers wishes.. Or accept the fact that she needs to stay home. It's not her choice nor is it yours. It's your brothers..", "NTA at all. As you said to her, this was not about her at all. Is she in any kind of therapy for her anxiety/postpartum etc? Since she's still making passive aggressive comments at you and your mum, keep reminding her it was your nephews funeral and it was all about them, not her. That if her anxiety means she will have to constantly miss out on events that are not baby friendly, she might benefit from some counseling.  \n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your nephew and can't begin to imagine what your family is going through. Just know you did the right thing and handled this admirably.", "NTA. \n\nYou wife is the AH and also extremely selfish. \n\nThe mourning parents shouldn\u2019t have to see a baby at their child\u2019s funeral. They shouldn\u2019t have to withstand an argument about it. Thank you for respecting their wishes. \n\nYour wife is horrible for making this all about her.", "NTA. It would have been beyond traumatic for your brother and his wife if you and your wife showed up at their son's funeral with your daughter. Your brother and his wife are dealing with the worst kind of loss possible, the loss of a dearly loved child. Bringing your daughter to an event where they're saying their final goodbyes to their son would be beyond cruel and heartless. And you're right, this whole thing wasn't about the two of you, it was about your brother and his wife and being there to support them as they walk through this horrible season of life, but your wife couldn't see past her own issues to be there for them in their time of need. I've never been pregnant, nor do I ever plan on being pregnant but I do have an anxiety disorder that I've had for my whole life and if there's one thing I've learned throughout my mental health journey it's that my worries and anxieties are my burden to deal with, and I cannot and should not expect others to bend over backwards or neglect their own wellbeing just to appease the anxiety monster that lives in my brain. It's my job to handle my anxiety, period.", "NTA babies do not belong at funerals.", "NTA. As someone who struggled with postpartum anxiety myself you are not the asshole here. I didn\u2019t leave my son for 10 months and looking back it was ridiculous because I needed a break so badly. Your wife is struggling and while you should be supportive, which it sounds like you are, you cannot own her anxiety. You did the right thing by offering two reasonable solutions and she chose one. It would have been completely rude of you not to respect the grieving parents wishes at their baby\u2019s funeral.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL are top priority. If roles where reversed you know your brother would have done the same for you and respected your wishes. Your wife unknowingly was being very selfish. She will in time perhaps realise the magnitude of the request. I'm so sorry for their loss, that is unimaginable pain.", "NTA. I can't understand what your wife is going through but that doesn't mean she can't have a little empathy for your family ffs.  Brother lost a baby around the same age as yours. Your baby would be a reminder of what they lost and that would be so incredibly heart wrenching while trying to mourn.", "You did the right thing. A lot of people here don't seem to understand how mental disorders fueled by hormones work. I don't blame your wife for her irrationalness, she's ill and likely cannot think straight. One thing I would consider is making sure her psych is qualified in detecting  post partum psychosis, I don't know enough about your wife to say I think she has it but it is something to watch for, especially if she is becoming more paranoid and unreasonable.", "NTA That\u2019s your brother and he just lost a child. He is mourning his baby of similar age while watching her hold your child. She wouldn\u2019t be comforting them but making them uncomfortable and she is being an AH for insisting they let the baby come. Imagine your child crying while there. Imagine them having to be so near her as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all be right next to them to help them get through this. She needs to not be so selfish. I get she has her reasons and fears for not leaving the baby but this day is about her at all. You did the right thing in supporting him and respecting his wishes", "NTA. You were completely right. This needs to be discussed in therapy. Your wife needs to talk about medication too, if she\u2019s currently not taking anything. This is not normal.", "Honestly, she needs to get professional help.", "NTA. Bringing a baby to a baby's funeral is totally insensitive & rude. I understand her reluctance to leave baby, but yeesh, what's she gonna do if she needs to go somewhere & you & mom aren't available to babysit??!!??

Whether she does or not, I don\u2019t know.\n\nTo me, this just sort of goes beyond the tools I was given. I validated her feelings about not wanting to leave the baby as well as that it was hard the natural outcome is she can\u2019t go.
