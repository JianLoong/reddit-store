It was just going to be my son, DIL and infant granddaughter, and my son invited a friend. I'm disabled, so don't have a ton of money, but went and bought all kinds of food. My son and DIL have been living with me for two months, and it was really as a last resort. I REALLY did not want them to because they lived with me for a year before and she didn't work one single day, or clean, or help out at all, either of them. They lived with me rent free. They trashed the place and left a bunch of garbage when they left. So I was really against them moving back, but they just had a baby and had no where to go. I've spent two months waking up to dirty dishes in the sink every morning. My son works nights, so they cook at night. My rule has always been, clean your dishes before you go to bed. Well, once again today, I woke up to dirty dishes, trash overflowing on the ground, and a dirty stove. Since I was doing food prep today for Thanksgiving, I was especially annoyed. Ants are out because there are crumbs. I woke them up to clean, which they weren't too happy about. Out of frustration and half as a joke, I took photos and posted to my personal FB account without blame, criticism, or any mention of them, just basically saying this is my life now and showed the sink full of dishes.  Well, they didn't like it. A huge fight ensued as they got mad that I posted generic photos. They both scolded me like a child. But the issue really began when my son's wife kept calling me a narcissist. Not really sure why. Then she goes on to say I'm mentally I'll because my house is a mess. No, my house was a mess because I'm disabled and an entire family moved in without notice and I had to clear out two rooms. I've asked for help repeatedly moving furniture, but no one will help me. But I literally spent two days cleaning everything. But then she goes on to say how I'm a horrible mother (so she lived with me for a year and I supported her, then I gave them thousands of dollars to pay bills, then they had to move in with me) and then she calls me a fucking bitch and a cunt. Mind you, this is all over the fact that she left her dirty dishes in the sink. The second she called me a CUNT, I just looked at her and said, do you really think I'm going to waste any more time cleaning the house and cooking Thanksgiving d\u00ednner for you if this is how you're going to treat me? I cancelled Thanksgiving and took all the decorations down. Now my son is pissed at me and said, Thanks for ruining Thanksgiving, Mom. Well, guess, what, actions have consequences. This cunt isn't going to slave away any more and be abused for it.", "created_utc": 1700692342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181lrsj/aitah_for_cancelling_thanksgiving/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
