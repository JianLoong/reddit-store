Last I checked the husband was born with a spine. How hard is it to say \"hey it's really unprofessional to pressure my spouse to find this business simply because I'm her spouse and neither of us appreciate the constant messages especially since they've already turned the start up down\".", "Her husband signed her up to get harassed by his boss and\u2026 you think that\u2019s ok?", "Ehh, I'm not saying the husband is in the right.   Why he couldn't just say no the company only invests in software tech and stand fi4m,  don't know.\nBut, I think that the wife could take an extra step for her husband, that she wouldn't take for her roommates uncles half brother.", "It\u2019s not ideal but shit happens and she handled it by blocking the number.  I think she\u2019s overreacting.", "That's showing a level of favoritism and from experience, the kind of person who won't accept the default email about the process and why you aren't eligible (which op says they send to everyone), harassed a lower level employee for the private information of their partner, and then called enough that they needed to be blocked wouldn't accept the no even if it was over a personal call. Those people will keep trying, and the more you give them (like a personal call), the more they feel entitled to. Op made the best professional move they could have.", "Her husband thinks it\u2019s her job to fix his job. \n\nThis is a stopgap.", "And she\u2019s not the only one here who is overreacting, clearly.", "I give it less than three months before hubby dearest forces the two of them into a social situation and tries to manipulate his wife to fund his boss\u2019 startup.\n\nYou seem to be totally cool with a partner forcing their boss on their spouse. \n\nWhy?\n\nHow many times have you made your spouse responsible for your boss?", "Why am I cool with it?  Because that\u2019s not what he\u2019s doing.  He\u2019s not in the doghouse at work and the boss has got her number blocked.  It\u2019s done.  It\u2019s over.  You\u2019re running with a fucked up machiavellian scenario that doesn\u2019t exist.", "The OP\u2019s husband literally tried to make his wife report to his boss. If you think this is over you are deluding yourself."]}
