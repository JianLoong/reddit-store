He\u2019s also incredibly handsome. I am not.\n\nRiver works in an industry that is very looks based. I\u2019ve noticed that he\u2019s embarrassed and ashamed when he introduces me as his wife to his coworkers. This has happened a few times. He shuffles awkwardly, he doesn\u2019t look anyone in the eye, and he makes a strained smile and immediately tries to veer the conversation away to something else- only when he says I\u2019m his wife. The events were \u201cmiserable\u201d for him. I stopped going to his events and now they are a success. It used to hurt but I realized that\u2019s just how the industry is, and people do judge him and talk behind his back because what I look like. People do that in general because he\u2019s more attractive than me.\n\nHe told me that he\u2019s trying very hard to succeed at his new job and his new boss was an insanely judgmental person. She destroyed the career of an employee who reported the team for exclusionary behavior and fired someone who wore the same jacket as her once, for example.\n\nMy coworker and I went to a fast casual restaurant for lunch yesterday. it wasn\u2019t as crowded as the other places during the lunchtime rush. My husband, his boss, and his coworker were already there unbeknownst to me. I saw him immediately but I pretended I didn\u2019t. However, it turns out River\u2019s boss and my coworker went to the same business school-not unusual. They caught up and introduced us all to each other. Instead of saying that he\u2019s my husband, I shook his hand and said \u201cnice to meet you\u201d. I sat next to my coworker and across from his coworker (not deliberately). I didn\u2019t say he was my husband but neither did he. I felt like he was looking at me but when I looked he was looking away.\n\nWhen I got home later that night he was crying. He said he didn\u2019t know what he did for me to ignore him and if our marriage meant so little why didn\u2019t I just take off my rings. I told him and said I didn\u2019t want to make him ashamed of me. He got very quiet.   My mom said I was acting ridiculous but my dad agreed with my reasoning.
