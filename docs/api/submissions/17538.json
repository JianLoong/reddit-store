My wife (34f) was working late while our son (9m) was hanging out with his friend.\n\nAround 8pm his friend's mom texted me letting me know that she was driving him home. I thanked her and then let my daughter know that her brother was on his way. She then suggested that we play a prank on him in which we jump out and scare him. I thought it would be a funny practical joke and--long story short--she and I ended up putting on scary Halloween masks, dimming the lights, and hiding behind a couch. I then texted his friend's mom and told her that his sister and I were watching a movie and to send him to the Family Room downstairs when he got home.\n\nHe got home and came in. We heard him come in and say \"Hello?\" and then come down the stairs. When he got close we jumped out at him and shouted.\n\nNow; here's where I fully admit I messed up. I thought he'd just be startled for a second and then would laugh with us over the prank. But that's not what happened. We ended up frightening him WAY more than I'd anticipated. He first started running off and then ended up having a HUGE, trembling, crying, adrenaline dump for a long time. I felt really bad and so did his sister.\n\nHis mother came home not long after and ended up sitting with him, hugging and comforting him. Naturally she wasn't amused by my antics which I understand because--again--I screwed up.\n\nHowever, she has stayed mad at me for all these days afterward. She will barely talk to me. I eventually got tired of it and told her that she needed to get over it. I screwed up but I didn't mean any harm. I just way underestimated how much our prank would scare our son. I also think that our daughter is seeing how she is treating me over it and is being made to feel way too bad over her idea that was just playful; not bad-natured. But she just says that I \"should have known better\" and won't seem to forgive me.\n\nI get it; she's always been a complete mama bear. But it's not as if I don't love our kids, too.

She may well be mad until your son fully recovers from the scare you gave him.  For him to have such a huge response to your \u201cprank\u201d suggests that he\u2019s sensitive (possibly anxiety or panic prone) and you should\u2019ve known better.  Big responses like that rarely come out of thin air.\n\nETA: As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, you didn\u2019t even comfort your own child.  You terrified him and left comforting him to the other parent, who hadn\u2019t even gotten home yet!  When your kid is so scared they are crying and trembling, even the most emotionally unintelligent parent should be able to recognize that they need to step in and help their poor child calm down.", "YTA\n\nYes, you should have known better. \n\nSure you've apologized but wife sounds fed up that there are three people acting like children in the house instead of two children and two adults who are supposed to look after them. \n\nShe can't be the only one left to make sensible decisions, that's not fair to her or your kids.\n\nPlus I really don't understand pranksters. Why is inflicting fear into a 9 year old funny?", "I'm not going to offer judgement just perspective.\n\nMy mom played a prank on me when I was little, where she pretended she wasnt my mom, and that she's calling the cops to find my real mom. She was rather insistent on this prank despite me not believing her initially. Eventually I ended up bawling my eyes out, terrified.\n\nThis memory followed me to adulthood and in therapy it was uncovered that her prank happened to hit the right chords for some issues I was already having.  \n\nAll this to say, it's really easy to accidentally traumatize a kid, and pranks that involve scaring young children should generally be avoided. I can understand your wife's feelings.", "YTA. it was night time and your kid was looking forward to seeing his family when coming home, you potentially traumatized him instead. your intentions don\u2019t mean anything here. common sense says you should\u2019ve known better, so i agree with your wife there too.\n\nmaybe instead of trying to make excuses or defend your actions, you help your son work through what happened, since it sounds like your wife has been the one who has had to.", "YTA. Why did I already know from the word \"prank\" in your title that you would be insufferable?\n\n\"I didn't mean any harm\" is no excuse.", "YTA.\n\nThis isn't remotely close to funny.", "INFO: Does your son typically *enjoy* scary movies, spooky stories and prank-scares? Or is he a more sensitive kid? I get that you didn't know better, but for me this hinges on whether you *should* have known better.", "Are you sure your son is the 9 year old? YTA", "YTA\n\nFirstly people are waking up to pranks just being shitty behaviour so please don't teach bad habits to your daughter that will make her school friends hate her.\n\nSecondly, look up emotional labour and read some articles. She's mad because you're being another task she has to deal with instead of someone who is helping her. You're an adult, step it up.", "YTA. She's still mad because you are still trying to defend what you did. You're not sorry about scarring your child at all. WhyTF should she forgive you? NOWHERE in her do you even MENTION sitting down and having a full talk with your son about what happened. She came home and had to clean up your mess. This is shit parenting.", "YTA\n\nGetting over a prank gone awry is something that might happen on its own, given enough time. Given your role in it, along with your admitted miscalculation of how much your son would be affected by it, what you are going to have to do is simply accept responsibility and own it, no matter how long it takes.\n\nThis is not her being a mama bear so much as it is her having to be the one to make it better with your boy. Acknowledging your mistake is an important first step, but do not expect anyone to simply dismiss it just because you admitted it.", "YTA you probably traumatized your child, why are you pulling a mean prank on a small at almost 40 yrs old", "YTA - Your \u201cprank\u201d went wrong, your wife is the one who had to spend time dealing with the consequences and you\u2019re annoyed she hasn\u2019t gotten over it quickly enough?", "YTA. Pranks are awful. They are reliant on someone being the butt of the prank with the ultimate aim of people laughing at their discomfort.  Its also about the fact you have added more emotional labour and work for your wife to sort out because you are teaching your daughter to laugh at other peoples expense. People say they never mean harm when it comes to pranks, but how can they not be harmful when they are reliant on someone elses discomfort/upset/humiliation for them to work! Be the adult and dont add more labour for her to fix.", "When one person is made to feel a negative emotion, such as fear, then the prank is only enjoyable for the pranksters. This kind of behavior is closer to abuse or bullying. Why do pranksters always think it is fun? Because they are not the ones who will have the negative experience. YTA", "YTA. \n\nPro tip... if your \"prank\" makes someone cry, it's not a prank, it's cruelty. I've never understood how people can think that \"good-natured\" jokes meant to upset others (especially little kids) are a good idea.\n\nLearn from this. Emotionally traumatizing your kid for laughs isn't funny.", "Yta. \n\nYes, you meant it as a prank.  But that's not how he took it.", "YTA - Prank's are barely funny at best. There is the odd harmless one but this one went past that stage", "YTA. When has telling someone who is upset to \"get over it\" ever helped a situation? You need to actually talk with your wife. Because yeah I do think being cold toward you for days is a little bit of an over the top reaction to- assuming your son has moved past it and isn't having nightmares or something. Which makes me think this is a straw that broke the camel's back and there's more that's going on here.", "YTA: First, those sorts of pranks can be terrifying for small children, and second, you don't seem to know your own kid well enough to know whether that sort of thing would traumatize them or make them laugh. It sounds like you weren't thinking carefully in the moment, when caught up in the idea of a funny adventure.\n\nIt stands out to me - I don't see the part where you apologized and comforted him before his mother came home.\n\nHave you apologized to your son? Is he still upset?\n\nDo you understand why what you did was harmful, and what effect it has had on the entire house? Have you apologized to your wife? I think an apology, in this case, would include explaining that you know why what you did was a bad idea, and that you will be more careful in the future.\n\nSomething that sticks out is what seems like maybe a difficulty being able to model the feelings of others beforehand, or that you might not have taken the time to do so in the moment. You did notice people's feelings after the fact, and expressed you feel bad, which seems like you do indeed care that everyone became upset.\n\nEven if you do apologize, and everyone accepts (as I hope and trust they will), don't be surprised if it takes their feelings some time to simmer down. Be patient.\n\nYes, you acted like an AH, but that doesn't mean you ARE one, or have to BE one. Long experience tells me that even the most well-meaning, awesomest parents screw up sometimes. Nobody is perfect. What is important is, if you make a mistake, apologize and do your best to be better in the future. We all fall down sometimes.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it\u201d isn\u2019t a defence. Your intention doesn\u2019t matter, you did it. It sounds like your son had a full blown panic attack. You don\u2019t just \u201cget over\u201d that. YTA.", "YTA. And the fact that you don't realize that and think your wife just needs to get over the fact that you terrified your son for your own fun makes you a bigger one.", "You're spinning it as a \"prank\"? Because I think it's just cruel. (Unless you're a 12 year old who doesn't know better). YTA", "YTA. Home is supposed to be safe space. You took that away from your son.", "Oh wow YTA. Complimentary pro tip: don't prank anybody ever. And you don't get to tell people when it's time to get over something that you did. Also- did you even apologize?", "NTA but I've got two boys and sometimes a fun prank can go wrong but you owned up to it. That's part of being a parent and father.", "YTA. It\u2019s very upsetting as a parent to feel that you cannot trust your partner with your children.", "I gotta go with YTA here. Look, from most perspectives, it seems like a simple prank that wouldn\u2019t hurt a lot. But some kids are more sensitive than others and this will genuinely freak them out, especially if they have anxiety already for some other reason. I used to get nightmares from Halloween decorations and was scared of Coraline, and at the same time I was a really anxious kid who was being neglected at my dad\u2019s house where they really loved Halloween because it was my stepsister\u2019s birthday. Everyone mocking the use of traumatized, yes that is the correct word here because while the kid will probably grow out of a fear of the masks, something is going to linger when a reaction like that is pulled.", "YTA. You did a stupid prank that wasn\u2019t funny. You \u201charmed\u201d your child. You have broken your wife\u2019s trust.", "YTA, you\u2019re a grown man, do better!!!!  You deserve to feel like a horrible parent and person!!!!", "YTA\n\nPutting your own amusement ahead of the interests of your own child is pretty cold dude.\n\nYeah she\u2019s right.\n\nActions speak louder than words.  Your actions say that you love yourself more than you love your kid.", "YTA surely by 9 years old ypu know your sons temperament? I'd be working on regaining the trust back with son not telling wife to get over it", "YTA. You deliberately traumatized for child for your amusement, and betrayed his trust. I wouldn't forgive you either.", "ESH, and by \u201cEveryone\u201d I also mean most of the commenters saying YTA.\n\nYTA, OP shouldn\u2019t have played this prank. He admits this in the post that he immediately realised his mistake. In a comment he says that he immediately comforted his son.\n\nThis isn\u2019t what the post is asking though. The question is \u201cAITA for telling my wife that she needs to get over being upset with me?\u201c\n\nYes, she should get over it. Holding this grudge is stressful on the daughter who instigated the prank. It is also modelling bad behaviour for his son and keeping the trauma alive.\n\nThere is some detail missing here, but if it hasn\u2019t happened already, Dad and daughter should apologise to the son with mum present. Be sure to let the son talk about his feelings and the impact on him. Make sure he knows he is loved by everyone. Follow this up with family event that your son would like.", "YTA and bully because the kind of excuses you're using is used by bullies to get way from their cruel act. Pranks are only funny when both sender and receiver finds it funny.", "YTA", "NAH- my mother told me one day that she saw a mouse in the basement bathroom and then a few days later on I knew she was on the computer down there and I just went down to ask her something . On the way I realized she hadn\u2019t heard me so I creeped behind her and said eek eek eek! and she turned around, looked me dead in the eye and started screaming over and over and over long after she knew it was me -that is how scared she was and of course I was in utter shock and felt horrible!  My dad heard her from upstairs somewhere and came racing down to see what had happened. It was terrible!  \n\nAnd that was when I realized that you never know the outcome of a scare prank and that it could be as bad as causing a heart attack.   I wont ever forget that.  I will never do it again and I\u2019m pretty sure that you probably won\u2019t either. \n\nYour wife, however, is feeling the trauma that her son is going through and she may logically understand that you didn\u2019t mean any harm, but right now she\u2019s a little traumatized on his behalf and I think you need to give her some space to deal with it. She may be wondering if she can trust your judgment from now on I mean there\u2019s probably a lot of questions and concerns going through her mind which she needs to work out.  \n\nMaybe you could be a little more supportive about it and say listen I\u2019m so sorry.  This was a huge error of judgment on my part and I want to make it right.  What can I do to help?  If you need time okay.  If you have another idea I\u2019m glad to listen and open to anything.  \n\nYou could also mention that your daughter is not doing well as a result either and you\u2019re worried about her as well and is there anyway that you guys can heal as a family (because this is happening, and now you have to deal with the reality of the situation).  Just do not be defensive, and do not guilt trip her for taking her time here -just be nothing but supportive and sorry.  This is unquestionably a lesson learned the hard way.", "NTA. You made a mistake. Nobody is perfect. You have apologised. everyone needs to move on", "NTA. Is your wife always this cold? She's generating unnecessary stress for everyone, including her kids. Her actions are no better than your prank.\n\nEdit: to make myself clear. The mother's behaviour is stressing out the daughter, making her feel guilty getting her father into trouble As the prank was her idea. If we expect the father to know better then it's reasonable to expect the mother to know better than needlessly stressing her daughter. The father apologised, comforted his kid, realised his mistake. What else is he supposed to do, commit seppuku? What does the mother hope to achieve by being cold to a regretful father?", "NTA. A prank backfired and went wrong, which yeah, you're TA for, but holy shit people make mistakes. You were just trying to have fun and it didn't end well. Does she really need to dwell on it for days?? I say next time she screws up somehow give her the silent treatment for days and constantly tell her she screwed up and should have known better, and see how she likes you beating the dead horse for days on end.", "NTA. It was a joke and you were bonding with your kids. How could you have known he'd react like that? Maybe your wife telling you it was too far would have been reasonable, but giving you the silent treatment is just childish.", "Does your son get scared or anxious easily? What have you and his sister done to make it up to him? Did you both give him a sincere apology for what you did?\n\nEdit: from OP's responses, it's clear that he didn't mean any harm or expected the severe reaction he got.  He also apologized and I assume is never going to pull another prank on his son. His wife's anger might feel justified to her, because she's just defending her child, but if it's effecting the family,  she needs to figure out a way to get over it. NTA", "Nah, assuming you have apologised profusely and learned your lesson.\nYou were bonding with your daughter, and thought it would be funny, but you looked at it only from your perspective of knowing it was a prank; without the masks & dimmed lights, it might even been funny because he'd have quickly and easily seen it was you (very subjective to the individuals involved). The way you did it made it impossible for him to quickly realise the prank so of course he was scared. \nYour wife is justified in having been mad but there's no gain in holding a grudge. My issue would be the sincere apology to son & wife from both you & daughter, and perhaps a family conversation on where the line is for everyone on what's funny when it comes to pranks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Forgiveness is a choice, that she is not ready to make, and trust is built.\n\nYou screwed up, you made the wrong choice. But you keep screwing up. You can't request people to get over it.

You\u2019ve admitted this in your post and followed up saying you comforted him afterwards. Fully understandable that he would go to his mother for comfort after she came kind. \n\nYour wife is being unreasonable here. As pissed off as she may be with you, she should not be modelling this behaviour to the kids. \n\nYou need to find a way for you and your daughter to apologise to your son and move on.", "In 2023 prankster and asshole are interchangeable.", "Sorry, but if you can't have fun without bothering other people, you aren't a prankster, your an AH. User name checks out", "Pranks are only fun of everyone is laughing. If only you are laughing you\u2019re a bully.", "As the one bothering people, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re having lots of fun. Those you\u2019re bothering? Probably not so much. Pranks should only be done when everyone involved is into it and laughs along, and that clearly isn\u2019t the case here.", "No, pranksters are insufferable people who cross boundaries to chase fun. That's why I don't have any prankster friends.\n\nOP, YTA. And you are too.", "Ah, I see now. YTA all the time as well.", "Seriously, that's psychotic behavior...", "he\u2019s small, they were wearing masks, and it was nighttime. the fact it took that much and that long to calm him down says there\u2019s likely some kind of trauma he got from it. there\u2019s different kinds of trauma and people handle things differently. if it wouldn\u2019t bother you? that\u2019s great! it clearly bothered the kid and the mother still seems to be handling it, so chances are it did on some level.", "And is this opinion coming from any actual psychological or childhood development knowledge, or do you just also traumatize your children and think it should be okay?", "It really depends on the state of someones nervous system. My default position is fight or flight and I have to work really hard to keep it in balance. Now the person doing the prank might think its harmless, but if your nervous system is disregulated, it is doing harm because its just adding another layer to trigger the system out of regulation. If the son is maybe more prone to being jumpy at scary stuff, dont underestimate the effect that this could have on the nervous system. A disregulated nervous system isnt a healthy nervous system", "This is reddit, of course he's traumatized now, everything traumatizes everyone now. He'll have PTSD for life and will need therapy for years to get over being spooked that one time.", "But is he an anxious child? Does he have nightmares, or dislike the dark, or express worry about the things he reads in scary stories?", "OP literally describes the trauma response the kid had", "Not really because we don't take part \ud83d\ude01", "What a boring life you must lead if the only way you can have fun means being AHs to other people", "Wow you're dedicated to being TA.\n\nWith this level of defensiveness? \n\nYou already know you're TA and keep trying to gaslight everyone.\n\nYou are a bad person and you should feel bad.", "How the fuck was it harmless??? The fucking intention of this prank was to cause harm. To a child.", "Anyone who works with children that age (like I used to) would have predicted that reaction.\n\nChildren are sensitive, can't regulate or manage emotions fully and are vulnerable at that age.", "It\u2019s his son who is nine. He appear admitted he messed up.", "You are supposed to be an adult. You missed that boat.", "How is he been behaving since the prank?", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting downvoted for this. You have admitted to making a mistake and are looking for help in moving forward.", "Nailed it. Even in the way he told the story you could see it.", "Take my poor woman\u2019s gold \ud83e\udd47", "Unless it\u2019s a trend of her coming home to fix his screw ups \u2026 more info needed because if this is recurring that she always has to step up for his blunders then he\u2019s YTA", "Lol don't ever let that kid go to any scary movie in his life or he might end up with deep seeded PTSD from it", "I\u2019m with you in that there seems to be more going on here than just this prank.  I hate pranks in general, and this would have scared me as a kid, but on the surface, this is a fairly common, non dangerous, low level prank.  But the child\u2019s reaction, and the mother\u2019s response makes me think there is background that we\u2019re missing.  Is this just the last in a long line of pranks?   Would there have been reason OP should have known how upsetting this could be?   Do OP and the sister gang up on the sons lot?  Does the mother overreact a lot?  There seems to be missing context \n.", "Hahaha you all sound like perfect targets for pranks \ud83d\ude1c lighten up and put a whoopie cushion on someone's chair or put their stapler in jello ffs haha I promise it's a lot of fun", "Guilty and contrite.", "You expect to be scared at scary movies. Not so much in your own home", "That's totally different. That's like saying people shouldn't go on rollercoasters because car crashes exist.", "You are such TA.", "Why would your son feel guilty about a prank played on him?", "Lol and the kid choosing to go see a hypothetical future scary movie is totally the same as the dad using another adult to set up the kid for a reverse home invasion from his loved ones! Apples n apples you crazy mama bear!", "Unagi MFers!", "Oh, I thought you said \"she.\" He seems to be over it; he's just uncomfortable over the awkwardness between me and his mom.", "Because he\u2019s probably trying to be the peace maker."]}
