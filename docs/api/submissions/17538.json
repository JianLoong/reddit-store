My wife (34f) was working late while our son (9m) was hanging out with his friend.\n\nAround 8pm his friend's mom texted me letting me know that she was driving him home. I thanked her and then let my daughter know that her brother was on his way. She then suggested that we play a prank on him in which we jump out and scare him. I thought it would be a funny practical joke and--long story short--she and I ended up putting on scary Halloween masks, dimming the lights, and hiding behind a couch. I then texted his friend's mom and told her that his sister and I were watching a movie and to send him to the Family Room downstairs when he got home.\n\nHe got home and came in. We heard him come in and say \"Hello?\" and then come down the stairs. When he got close we jumped out at him and shouted.\n\nNow; here's where I fully admit I messed up. I thought he'd just be startled for a second and then would laugh with us over the prank. But that's not what happened. We ended up frightening him WAY more than I'd anticipated. He first started running off and then ended up having a HUGE, trembling, crying, adrenaline dump for a long time. I felt really bad and so did his sister.\n\nHis mother came home not long after and ended up sitting with him, hugging and comforting him. Naturally she wasn't amused by my antics which I understand because--again--I screwed up.\n\nHowever, she has stayed mad at me for all these days afterward. She will barely talk to me. I eventually got tired of it and told her that she needed to get over it. I screwed up but I didn't mean any harm. I just way underestimated how much our prank would scare our son. I also think that our daughter is seeing how she is treating me over it and is being made to feel way too bad over her idea that was just playful; not bad-natured. But she just says that I \"should have known better\" and won't seem to forgive me.\n\nI get it; she's always been a complete mama bear. But it's not as if I don't love our kids, too.

She may well be mad until your son fully recovers from the scare you gave him.  For him to have such a huge response to your \u201cprank\u201d suggests that he\u2019s sensitive (possibly anxiety or panic prone) and you should\u2019ve known better.  Big responses like that rarely come out of thin air.\n\nETA: As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, you didn\u2019t even comfort your own child.  You terrified him and left comforting him to the other parent, who hadn\u2019t even gotten home yet!  When your kid is so scared they are crying and trembling, even the most emotionally unintelligent parent should be able to recognize that they need to step in and help their poor child calm down.", "YTA\n\nYes, you should have known better. \n\nSure you've apologized but wife sounds fed up that there are three people acting like children in the house instead of two children and two adults who are supposed to look after them. \n\nShe can't be the only one left to make sensible decisions, that's not fair to her or your kids.\n\nPlus I really don't understand pranksters. Why is inflicting fear into a 9 year old funny?", "I'm not going to offer judgement just perspective.\n\nMy mom played a prank on me when I was little, where she pretended she wasnt my mom, and that she's calling the cops to find my real mom. She was rather insistent on this prank despite me not believing her initially. Eventually I ended up bawling my eyes out, terrified.\n\nThis memory followed me to adulthood and in therapy it was uncovered that her prank happened to hit the right chords for some issues I was already having.  \n\nAll this to say, it's really easy to accidentally traumatize a kid, and pranks that involve scaring young children should generally be avoided. I can understand your wife's feelings.", "YTA. it was night time and your kid was looking forward to seeing his family when coming home, you potentially traumatized him instead. your intentions don\u2019t mean anything here. common sense says you should\u2019ve known better, so i agree with your wife there too.\n\nmaybe instead of trying to make excuses or defend your actions, you help your son work through what happened, since it sounds like your wife has been the one who has had to.", "YTA. Why did I already know from the word \"prank\" in your title that you would be insufferable?\n\n\"I didn't mean any harm\" is no excuse.", "YTA.\n\nThis isn't remotely close to funny.", "INFO: Does your son typically *enjoy* scary movies, spooky stories and prank-scares? Or is he a more sensitive kid? I get that you didn't know better, but for me this hinges on whether you *should* have known better.", "Are you sure your son is the 9 year old? YTA", "YTA\n\nFirstly people are waking up to pranks just being shitty behaviour so please don't teach bad habits to your daughter that will make her school friends hate her.\n\nSecondly, look up emotional labour and read some articles. She's mad because you're being another task she has to deal with instead of someone who is helping her. You're an adult, step it up.", "YTA. She's still mad because you are still trying to defend what you did. You're not sorry about scarring your child at all. WhyTF should she forgive you? NOWHERE in her do you even MENTION sitting down and having a full talk with your son about what happened. She came home and had to clean up your mess. This is shit parenting.", "YTA\n\nGetting over a prank gone awry is something that might happen on its own, given enough time. Given your role in it, along with your admitted miscalculation of how much your son would be affected by it, what you are going to have to do is simply accept responsibility and own it, no matter how long it takes.\n\nThis is not her being a mama bear so much as it is her having to be the one to make it better with your boy. Acknowledging your mistake is an important first step, but do not expect anyone to simply dismiss it just because you admitted it.", "YTA you probably traumatized your child, why are you pulling a mean prank on a small at almost 40 yrs old", "YTA - Your \u201cprank\u201d went wrong, your wife is the one who had to spend time dealing with the consequences and you\u2019re annoyed she hasn\u2019t gotten over it quickly enough?", "YTA. Pranks are awful. They are reliant on someone being the butt of the prank with the ultimate aim of people laughing at their discomfort.  Its also about the fact you have added more emotional labour and work for your wife to sort out because you are teaching your daughter to laugh at other peoples expense. People say they never mean harm when it comes to pranks, but how can they not be harmful when they are reliant on someone elses discomfort/upset/humiliation for them to work! Be the adult and dont add more labour for her to fix.", "When one person is made to feel a negative emotion, such as fear, then the prank is only enjoyable for the pranksters. This kind of behavior is closer to abuse or bullying. Why do pranksters always think it is fun? Because they are not the ones who will have the negative experience. YTA", "YTA. \n\nPro tip... if your \"prank\" makes someone cry, it's not a prank, it's cruelty. I've never understood how people can think that \"good-natured\" jokes meant to upset others (especially little kids) are a good idea.\n\nLearn from this. Emotionally traumatizing your kid for laughs isn't funny.", "Yta. \n\nYes, you meant it as a prank.  But that's not how he took it.", "YTA - Prank's are barely funny at best. There is the odd harmless one but this one went past that stage", "YTA. When has telling someone who is upset to \"get over it\" ever helped a situation? You need to actually talk with your wife. Because yeah I do think being cold toward you for days is a little bit of an over the top reaction to- assuming your son has moved past it and isn't having nightmares or something. Which makes me think this is a straw that broke the camel's back and there's more that's going on here.", "YTA: First, those sorts of pranks can be terrifying for small children, and second, you don't seem to know your own kid well enough to know whether that sort of thing would traumatize them or make them laugh. It sounds like you weren't thinking carefully in the moment, when caught up in the idea of a funny adventure.\n\nIt stands out to me - I don't see the part where you apologized and comforted him before his mother came home.\n\nHave you apologized to your son? Is he still upset?\n\nDo you understand why what you did was harmful, and what effect it has had on the entire house? Have you apologized to your wife? I think an apology, in this case, would include explaining that you know why what you did was a bad idea, and that you will be more careful in the future.\n\nSomething that sticks out is what seems like maybe a difficulty being able to model the feelings of others beforehand, or that you might not have taken the time to do so in the moment. You did notice people's feelings after the fact, and expressed you feel bad, which seems like you do indeed care that everyone became upset.\n\nEven if you do apologize, and everyone accepts (as I hope and trust they will), don't be surprised if it takes their feelings some time to simmer down. Be patient.\n\nYes, you acted like an AH, but that doesn't mean you ARE one, or have to BE one. Long experience tells me that even the most well-meaning, awesomest parents screw up sometimes. Nobody is perfect. What is important is, if you make a mistake, apologize and do your best to be better in the future. We all fall down sometimes.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it\u201d isn\u2019t a defence. Your intention doesn\u2019t matter, you did it. It sounds like your son had a full blown panic attack. You don\u2019t just \u201cget over\u201d that. YTA.", "YTA. And the fact that you don't realize that and think your wife just needs to get over the fact that you terrified your son for your own fun makes you a bigger one.", "You're spinning it as a \"prank\"? Because I think it's just cruel. (Unless you're a 12 year old who doesn't know better). YTA", "YTA. Home is supposed to be safe space. You took that away from your son.", "Oh wow YTA. Complimentary pro tip: don't prank anybody ever. And you don't get to tell people when it's time to get over something that you did. Also- did you even apologize?", "NTA but I've got two boys and sometimes a fun prank can go wrong but you owned up to it. That's part of being a parent and father.", "YTA. It\u2019s very upsetting as a parent to feel that you cannot trust your partner with your children.", "I gotta go with YTA here. Look, from most perspectives, it seems like a simple prank that wouldn\u2019t hurt a lot. But some kids are more sensitive than others and this will genuinely freak them out, especially if they have anxiety already for some other reason. I used to get nightmares from Halloween decorations and was scared of Coraline, and at the same time I was a really anxious kid who was being neglected at my dad\u2019s house where they really loved Halloween because it was my stepsister\u2019s birthday. Everyone mocking the use of traumatized, yes that is the correct word here because while the kid will probably grow out of a fear of the masks, something is going to linger when a reaction like that is pulled.", "YTA. You did a stupid prank that wasn\u2019t funny. You \u201charmed\u201d your child. You have broken your wife\u2019s trust.", "YTA, you\u2019re a grown man, do better!!!!  You deserve to feel like a horrible parent and person!!!!", "YTA\n\nPutting your own amusement ahead of the interests of your own child is pretty cold dude.\n\nYeah she\u2019s right.\n\nActions speak louder than words.  Your actions say that you love yourself more than you love your kid.", "YTA surely by 9 years old ypu know your sons temperament? I'd be working on regaining the trust back with son not telling wife to get over it", "YTA. You deliberately traumatized for child for your amusement, and betrayed his trust. I wouldn't forgive you either.", "ESH, and by \u201cEveryone\u201d I also mean most of the commenters saying YTA.\n\nYTA, OP shouldn\u2019t have played this prank. The tiny minority of commenters who say otherwise are misguided.  OP admits in his post that he immediately realised his mistake. In a comment he says that he immediately comforted his son.\n\nThis isn\u2019t what the post is asking though. The question is \u201cAITA for telling my wife that she needs to get over being upset with me?\u201c\n\nYes, she needs to get over it. Holding this grudge is stressful on the daughter who instigated the prank. It is also modelling bad behaviour for his son and keeping the trauma alive.\n\nOP should also try to understand his wife\u2019s point of view. Are there other incidents that have caused her to react this way? What would she need to move on from this?\n\nIf it hasn\u2019t happened already, Dad and daughter should apologise to the son with mum present. Be sure to let the son talk about his feelings and the impact on him. Make sure he knows he is loved by everyone. Follow this up with family event that the son would like.", "YTA and bully because the kind of excuses you're using is used by bullies to get way from their cruel act. Pranks are only funny when both sender and receiver finds it funny.", "YTA", "NAH- my mother told me one day that she saw a mouse in the basement bathroom and then a few days later on I knew she was on the computer down there and I just went down to ask her something . On the way I realized she hadn\u2019t heard me so I creeped behind her and said eek eek eek! and she turned around, looked me dead in the eye and started screaming over and over and over long after she knew it was me -that is how scared she was and of course I was in utter shock and felt horrible!  My dad heard her from upstairs somewhere and came racing down to see what had happened. It was terrible!  \n\nAnd that was when I realized that you never know the outcome of a scare prank and that it could be as bad as causing a heart attack.   I wont ever forget that.  I will never do it again and I\u2019m pretty sure that you probably won\u2019t either. \n\nYour wife, however, is feeling the trauma that her son is going through and she may logically understand that you didn\u2019t mean any harm, but right now she\u2019s a little traumatized on his behalf and I think you need to give her some space to deal with it. She may be wondering if she can trust your judgment from now on I mean there\u2019s probably a lot of questions and concerns going through her mind which she needs to work out.  \n\nMaybe you could be a little more supportive about it and say listen I\u2019m so sorry.  This was a huge error of judgment on my part and I want to make it right.  What can I do to help?  If you need time okay.  If you have another idea I\u2019m glad to listen and open to anything.  \n\nYou could also mention that your daughter is not doing well as a result either and you\u2019re worried about her as well and is there anyway that you guys can heal as a family (because this is happening, and now you have to deal with the reality of the situation).  Just do not be defensive, and do not guilt trip her for taking her time here -just be nothing but supportive and sorry.  This is unquestionably a lesson learned the hard way.", "NTA. You made a mistake. Nobody is perfect. You have apologised. everyone needs to move on", "NTA. Is your wife always this cold? She's generating unnecessary stress for everyone, including her kids. Her actions are no better than your prank.\n\nEdit: to make myself clear. The mother's behaviour is stressing out the daughter, making her feel guilty getting her father into trouble As the prank was her idea. If we expect the father to know better then it's reasonable to expect the mother to know better than needlessly stressing her daughter. The father apologised, comforted his kid, realised his mistake. What else is he supposed to do, commit seppuku? What does the mother hope to achieve by being cold to a regretful father?", "NTA. A prank backfired and went wrong, which yeah, you're TA for, but holy shit people make mistakes. You were just trying to have fun and it didn't end well. Does she really need to dwell on it for days?? I say next time she screws up somehow give her the silent treatment for days and constantly tell her she screwed up and should have known better, and see how she likes you beating the dead horse for days on end.", "NTA. It was a joke and you were bonding with your kids. How could you have known he'd react like that? Maybe your wife telling you it was too far would have been reasonable, but giving you the silent treatment is just childish.", "Does your son get scared or anxious easily? What have you and his sister done to make it up to him? Did you both give him a sincere apology for what you did?\n\nEdit: from OP's responses, it's clear that he didn't mean any harm or expected the severe reaction he got.  He also apologized and I assume is never going to pull another prank on his son. His wife's anger might feel justified to her, because she's just defending her child, but if it's effecting the family,  she needs to figure out a way to get over it. NTA", "Nah, assuming you have apologised profusely and learned your lesson.\nYou were bonding with your daughter, and thought it would be funny, but you looked at it only from your perspective of knowing it was a prank; without the masks & dimmed lights, it might even been funny because he'd have quickly and easily seen it was you (very subjective to the individuals involved). The way you did it made it impossible for him to quickly realise the prank so of course he was scared. \nYour wife is justified in having been mad but there's no gain in holding a grudge. My issue would be the sincere apology to son & wife from both you & daughter, and perhaps a family conversation on where the line is for everyone on what's funny when it comes to pranks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Forgiveness is a choice, that she is not ready to make, and trust is built.\n\nYou screwed up, you made the wrong choice. But you keep screwing up. You can't request people to get over it.

I gave mild Y T A for the prank but I realize he wasn't asking about that so I'm changing it. OP NTA", "> OP KNOWS he effed up and is TA for scaring his son,\n\nDoes he?  He has done nothing to help his son", "He was abusive so, i think the getting joy out of it was part of it.\nNot saying that OP is abusive, because a jump scare at home isn't the same to many people's stories here, but i think he needs to apologize to his son if he hasn't. His wife does need to let it go because it isn't healthy to hold onto this in the slightest. He messed up and the best he can do is assure his son he won't do it again after seeing how he reacted.", "I Haye when someone starts picking an analogy apart. It was fine, everyone gets it, and then someone comes along like. \"Actually, plates can't have feelings\" or something.", "Or you dropped the plate on a tile floor to see if it would really break, because you always heard it would but didn\u2019t believe YOUR plate would.", "There's a difference between intending to spook someone and intending to give them a panic attack.  Saying OP's intent was fulfilled is like saying someone's intent to have a campfire was fulfilled when the forest burned down.", "A reasonable person should be taking intent into consideration.", "I'll give another example: one time when my housemate was away on a trip, I went through the house and put googly eyes on a ton of stuff. Not everything, just a random assortment, some of it stuff that was at the backs of cupboards that I put back where I found it. She kept finding them for months and I took a lot of joy in her \"godDAMNIT, YawningDodo!\" every time. But so did she; it was like a pun or a dad joke that makes you groan. She even moved some of the things to be on display, and never took the googly eyes off of a fridge magnet I was sure she'd de-googly immediately. \n\nAnyway, the big difference is that a good prank doesn't hurt anyone, doesn't cause damage to their stuff, and provides enjoyment for both the pranker and the prank-ee.", "See to me that's not a prank, that's doing something sweet and special that will make your friend laugh. A prank to me, and what I keep seeing and hearing, us all about exploiting a weakness of someone you love so YOU can laugh.", "Notes in a backpack are completely different than coming home to a dark home and 2 masked people jumping out & shouting at you.", "That wasn\u2019t a prank. That was a sweet gesture.", "I can relate! We did this as a team, to a colleague who went on vacation. She left a bunch of post-it notes (quite a few, actually) on our keyboards or monitors with reminders of things that needed to be done during her vacation.\n\nWhen she got back, her whole chair, computer and monitor were covered in colourful post-it notes with smiley faces and phrases like \"Welcome back\" and \"Hope you had fun!\"", "A prank would have been smearing honey inside all of the pockets of the backpack. Which would have been mean. Because pranks aren't funny.", "I don\u2019t think most people would call that a prank.   That\u2019s like saying I prank my kids when I put notes in their lunchbox.", "Now THAT's a prank -- one where everyone's laughing and no one's upset. If the prank-ee isn't having at least as much fun as the prankster, it's not actually a prank, it's just bullying.", "If you're going to prank her then at least have the decency to defecate in the bag", "My dad once hid behind the wall outside our bathroom to jump out at kid-me when I walked out. Ever since then (even though I don\u2019t live at home anymore), whenever I walk out of that bathroom, I always have this little worried feeling that someone\u2019s going to jump out at me. He only did it once but it really stuck with me", "Startles can actually be good for people\u2014there is research showing that they can actually reduce overall anxiety when the person is otherwise confident that they are safe. \n\nThis was not a startle. This child did not feel safe. OP is TA.", "He\u2019s also blaming the 10 year old sister as it was \u201cher idea that was just play-ful not bad natured.\u201d\n\nKids do have playful ideas, but I guarantee it was OP who turned it into the kind of production ie. not playful anymore, that led to this horrible outcome. \n\nAnd if all of this was the little girls ideas, it\u2019s our job as adults to moderate things to avoid such a horrible outcome.", "OP, YTA for \u201cYou need to get over it\u201d. \n\nDamn, man. Wtf is wrong with you?\n\nHow about \u201cI know I screwed up, but how can we work through this as a family in a positive way?\u201d Aside from feeling bad, what have you come up with here, OP?", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to assume he did that. He emphasized he know he messed up and he felt bad about it and so did his daughter. Just cause he didn\u2019t say all of that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t reasonable happen.", "And if OP is in the United States, this is a child who's spent about half his life doing active shooter drills at school.  Kids are more aware of their mortality than ever before.  (It's a really weird point in time to work with children.)", "I think he'll get served divorce papers.", "What in your opinion is the difference between acknowledging you screwed up and taking responsibility?\n\nAlso I'm not sure why everyone is assuming he didn't do any comforting. I assumed that is what happened until the mom got home and took over.", "He did do something about it tho. He comforted his son but the mom took over when she got home.  He's still wrong and it was too much so he's YTA but he did comfort his kid and apologized and realized he was wrong", "Ok, that has nothing to do with whether he's acknowledging a pattern of behavior or saying that he is repeatingly acknowledging this was clearly improper behavior.", "Totally unrelated to whether he's acknowledging repeated behavior, or repeatedly acknowledging this is bad behavior. He did the latter.", "op does tho. after bullying his NINE year old into ptsd. \n\nmy brother hid under my bed once, when I was like 9. and grabbed my ankle in the dark when i entered the room. thinking about it still makes my blood run cold and it absolutely destroyed my sense of safety for a long time.

Do you think this makes her son feel better? Doubtful. It\u2019s making him and the daughter feel bad over what was supposed to be a joke. EVERYONE has played the scare game. Unless the child is developmentally challenged he would have no way of knowing it would affect him so much. The wife is a selfish abusive AH, her actions do nothing to help the son, this is just to make her feel better, and the father even worse. NTA", "what? \"I screwed up\" is not accepting blame in what world lmao.", ">You said you \"screwed up--again\". \n\nThis you?", "Laughed out loud at this", "The number of people minimizing this as a mere prank is baffling to me. \u201cHaha son, you thought you were in mortal danger! Funny!\u201d", "Here's the difference: you enjoyed it. This kid obviously did not. Once you know someone is not having a good time with your \"pranks\" and \"goofing around,\" you cut it out. As a parent, you have a responsibility to stop the behavior and apologize sincerely, not continue to defend your prank.", "hes /9/. not all kids are the same, not all of them can handle shit like that at a young age. i couldnt. it was terrifying and i had nightmares. hes a fucking child. you cannot expect him to be able to handle it when hes not even a teenager. hes still in elementary school, hell, 3rd grade. hes young, give him time. your kids must be terrified of you.", "Over jumping out for a scare prank??? Like the most common and harmless prank??? Everyone did this all the time when I was growing up - friends, relatives, teachers, etc. It\u2019s as harmless as it could get.\n\nThis is ridiculous to question your marriage over.", "How do people like you exisit in reality?\n\nWay to minimize actual abuse and trauma.", "If you think a single jump scare, intended to be fun but misjudged, followed by immediately attempting to console and comfort the son, constitutes bullying then I don't think you're qualified to participate in any conversation.\n\nPlease get a grip over your sense of proportion.", "How ridiculous! I have two children, similar ages to these ones. We jump scare each other often and we all think it\u2019s all in good fun. We even have a creepy doll that we occasionally hide in the hopes of scaring each other and we started that years ago when they were much younger. I guess I\u2019m abusive. Give your head a shake. This child may be extra sensitive, but jump scaring people isn\u2019t bullying or abusive. It might be if he were to continue to do so now knowing how badly it might affect the boy, but in general, 99% of the time, it\u2019s relatively harmless.", "Exactly! Moving forwards there are two options: you either forgive, or you don't. If you're going to forgive, do it quickly so the kids aren't in a hostile environment. If you're not going to forgive, break up quickly so the kids aren't in a hostile environment.

I think one of my friends was still finding them years later when his parents packed up the house to move out.", "Exactly! That\u2019s the kind of \u201cprank \u201cI like to do. It doesn\u2019t hurt anyone, and it might only mildly annoy them.", "OK, that makes sense. I don\u2019t pick on people\u2019s weaknesses. As a disabled person who has had my disability my entire life, I\u2019ve been a victim of that way too much. I try not to do anything hurtful.", "yep, that's just having fun and everyone's in on it and can enjoy it. A prank is one sided and the person being pranked is pressured to pretend they enjoyed it. pranks are shitty", "Lots of pranks are harmless though (and I\u2019m a big proponent of that those are the only kinds of pranks anyone should ever consider). Like, once me and some team members moved stuff on another team members desk around very, very subtly for months until he noticed. The big thing is knowing the person you are pranking and also considering what\u2019s the worst harm that could come from something. We absolutely knew our coworker would find it funny (and he did). Some people would not appreciate things on their desk being touched period, so that wouldn\u2019t be harmless.", "Especially when kids see the news with armed masked intruders every couple of days. They have drills at schools telling them what to do when there is an active shooter. No wonder the boy is in such a panic. I can\u2019t believe a parent would do this to his child!", "Our lab did this to one of the heads of a research team, but they gift wrapped everything on her bench.  All the way from pens, to folders, to pipettes to her chair.  She loved it and everyone got a huge laugh.  We still talk about it years later.", "OK then maybe it\u2019s not a prank. Just something fun. That\u2019s the kind of thing I like to do. Also on April fools day, when I was a cook, I made mashed potatoes and meatloaf look like cupcakes. I like to do fun things like that.", "This reminds me of the guy who pulled a scare/jump prank on his 17 year old step son, caused him to fall and end up with irreversible head trauma who then would spend his entire life as a 7 year old trapped in his teen/adult body. Wife divorced him and her sister was like what I liked him? Shes overreacting!\n\nLike the only thing that matters in this scenario is the childs well being and the actions of the parent who is actually protecting that child and has their well-being at heart. I think fathers can be as maternal as mothers, so this isnt a gender thing, this is a complete lack of maturity and accountability towards your own family kind of thing. You are an adult, there to keep the kids safe, not regress into one and traumatize your own kids development. Possibly for both kids in this case, although one of them might need immediate therapy more than the other. Jesus. He's upset she's mad at him. I'd have picked my son up and left until he was okay. And then I'd consider if I should even bring him back. You might think thats a hard overreact, for some of us its just protecting our vulnerable, growing kid.", "This is an.... unfortunately excellent point.", "Very good point. \n\nMan, last prank I pulled on my 10 year old nephew, was the ol' \"you got something on your shirt.\" He thought it was hilarious.", "This is such a good point, as if kids aren\u2019t in fight or flight enough already every single day they have to go to school in this country, now he has to be on high alert walking into his home too.

He and his daughter did comfort the kids, mom took over when she got home, he apologized, realized he was wrong, the kid isn't upset with him anymore, so not sure why people are still acting like op didn't do any of this.\nEasier just to read their echo chamber comments apparently instead of getting all the information before passing judgement.", "Taking actions and steps to try and undo the damage my actions caused.\n\nI can say I'm sorry for hurting someone all I want. That's acknowledging I screwed up but it's that's not taking responsibility.   \n\nSaying I'm sorry, let me apply first aid and check up on you afterward is taking responsibility.\n\nHe \"comforted\" his son but then pass the buck over to the wife. Apparently his comforting was very poor since son was still distressed. \n\nOnce again buried in his comments, his son feels \"Guilty and contrite.\" Why should the son, the victim, feel guilty?\n\n It's OP's opinion son seem over it and is just uncomfortable. Considering OP's inability to read the room, I don't even take that statement with a pinch of salt. Maybe he should talk to his son and ask without pressuring him, rather than assume? \n\nHe doesn't get to chose when he's off the hook.

Every time this person opens his mouth he says more things that make him look worse. When someone says they figured something out \"only in hindsight\" they're telling you they didn't think for a moment about the possible consequences of their actions.\n\nA fit parent would have known that about their child and not fallen to the childish impulse to \"prank\" them. People have literally died playing \"pranks\" like this--both pranker and prankee. It's not a joke, it's not funny, it's just an immature asshole bullying his child.\n\nDefending him? Ooof. Not a good look.", "That is so wholesome! We really need more of that and less of pranks intended to make fun of people. You sound like a great person!", "Last prank I pulled on my younger brothers was scaring them with a harmonica, and it was THEIR idea. They're both fairly jumpy kids and I move pretty quietly on a good day, so I never would've done it if they hadn't asked me to.", "I love responses like this. I like the cowardly downvotes I\u2019m receiving even more. You\u2019ve done absolutely nothing to argue against my point. I get it, there is no logical argument for her behaviour. He feels bad, his daughter feels bad, she is making them both feel worse. He learned his lesson and he makes this clear. Continually shaming him for an acknowledged mistake is harmful, to him and the children.\n\nIf you feel emotional abuse is acceptable response to a mistake, I feel sorry for any partner you have had, do have, or will have in the future. No one deserves to be with someone like you or OPs wife.", "You listen to yourself. It clearly wasn\u2019t \u201cjust a prank\u201d to OPs son. Daughter is a kid, kids have bad ideas all the time.
