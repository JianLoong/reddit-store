She is quite talented when she puts her mind to it. She is also a single mom of two kids 7y & 4y boys. She still lives with mom and step dad (her dad) as she works part time at a beauty store and part time trying to start her own business. I know she doesn\u2019t make enough money to pay her bills, so my parents usually have to step up and pay for necessities (bills, clothes for the kids, etc.) My sister is also not good with handling money. She doesn\u2019t stick to her budget, so on more than one occasion, my hubby and I (both 34) have had to cover bills for the house. \n\r\nEvery year, we spend between $30-50 on each nephew. We know they do not get a lot from my sister or my parents. My sister always requests that her name is on at least one gift for each nephew. To be honest, it really doesn\u2019t bother us. I know she is trying. So, as usual, I ask my sister to send me a list of things the boys would like. She ends up calling me with a proposition. I would buy a $400 cricut machine, and I wouldn\u2019t have to buy the boys a gift. I tell her I am uncomfortable not getting the boys nothing AND $400 is really expensive. Can I get her something else? Welp, she then just hangs up. I realize, if she doesn\u2019t want to talk like an adult, I\u2019m not calling her back\u2026\n\r\nSo, my stepdad calls me. IMO he has always coddled my sister. She is his only child, so growing up, she got away with everything. My stepdad tells me \u201chow disappointed he is in me that I won\u2019t help my sister with her dream! Her business is finally paying off, but she NEEDS this machine! She has SOO many \u201cpre-orders\u201d that if she doesn\u2019t get them done, ETSY will blacklist her from selling!\u201d I tell my stepdad, \u201ci can\u2019t afford to buy her a $400 gift. That\u2019s more than I am spending on both of my kids.\u201d My stepdad scoffs and says, \u201cOk, then don\u2019t plan on us getting you or hubby gifts. I find it ridiculous family can\u2019t help family.\u201d\n\r\nI end up calling my mom crying. I am more mad that I\u2019m being accused of not supporting family. I remind my mom that my husband and I have always helped when needed. But buying a $400 gift is excessive. My mom agrees but says that every other family member (GMA, uncle, aunt) are buying her materials. We would be the only ones not helping. I tell her that if she really needs a $400 machine to start her business, then perhaps she is not ready to start her business. It was not a good idea for her to take orders she can\u2019t fulfill right now.\u201d My mom accosts me by saying, \u201cMust be nice having money all the time. Your sister is trying to better herself.\u201d \n\r\nI have texted my sister, but she responded with a gif of the middle finger. My hubby says we will not be caving in to buying a $400 gift. We still plan on getting my nephews their gifts. \n\r\nAITA for not buying an expensive gift? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, but I may be too upset to think clearly about how this would affect my sister.", "created_utc": 1669771828, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8cz4d/aita_for_not_buying_a_gift_to_support_my_sister/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Technically, I can afford to buy the machine. I know for certain no one else in my family can. But, the whole experience has left me feeling like a money bank. Without the new machine, my sister wouldn't be able to fulfill the orders and I'm not sure she would be able to sell online again.

Don't worry, your sister / parents won't cut you out forever, they will be asking for another favor for her by next year, it's not a forever loss", "NTA. She can get a cricut joy for 120 dollars. It\u2019s a smaller version of a cricut and basically does the exact same thing. They even give you the option to pay with affirm on Amazon so she can literally pay 20 dollars a month until it\u2019s paid off. I mean if she really \u201cneeds\u201d this machine, she should\u2019ve researched that and know that there are so many more affordable models. She is scamming you and running to your parents to try and guilt you into buying the Bentley version of cricut machines, I guarantee she does not need a 400 dollar cricut.", "NTA she sounds very entitled and if she believe that possessing a cricut is what refrains her from being successfull, she's in for a nice awakening....", "NTA at all. Your family besides your husband and nephews are AHs though. Holy smokes tell sister it\u2019s time to grow up and put her big girl pants on!", "NTA Right now she is running a charity , not a business.", "Honestly OP NTA, $400 is a lot for a gift unless it is absolutely necessary for example medical. Does your sister actually need it instead of say food or clothes for her kids. No your parents coddled her too much if they have to foot the bills for her. If she wants the machine she\u2019ll have to earn the money the right way or better yet her parents can buy it for her. It seems weird she has preorders for products she hasn\u2019t made if she doesn\u2019t have the tools for it much less being a aspiring artist, has she actually made money from her hobbies, if not that is what it is a hobby, no disrespect to anyone who are artists as a living but unless she is actually selling her work not just trying to get instagram likes it\u2019s a $400 waste of space in the basement. Maybe if you can ask your nephews what they would like for Christmas or ask them what did they ask Santa for Christmas. Don\u2019t let people who can\u2019t see the difference between dreams and reality tell you you\u2019re a bad person your being realistic and shelling out a large amount of money on something that would be used once then forgotten isn\u2019t worth it.", "Wow! NTA. If she is \"starting\" a business then she should get a business loan for her business necessities and not count on the family backing the whole thing. This also sounds like your nephews are not getting any presents from anybody.", "NTA, this is ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nIf anyone is interested, I'm making custom oil paintings and you can buy one now starting at the low price of $1500. Money in advance please. Also, I don't actually have the canvas, or paints, or easel, or any freaking clue what I'm doing, but I'm happy to take your money. I'll get my sister to pay my way through art school.\n\nSee? It sounds stupid when it's spelled out like that. You don't owe her a $400 Cricut machine.", "NTA. Not one bit.", "NTA it\u2019s offensive how your family is trying to tell you to spend this ridiculous amount on a gift to support her I\u2019ll planned business ventures. If they think she needs the machine, they can buy it for her.", "NTA. Your sister sounds incredibly immature and entitled. And, your mother and stepfather are enablers. You and your husband (and the nephews) might well be the only members of the family who aren\u2019t AHs. If this were my situation, I would buy gifts for the nephews with my and my husband\u2019s names on them and I would forgo all other gifts. Let the choosing beggars go pound sand.", "NTA.  Tell your parents and her loving father to buy it for her.  It\u2019s ridiculous to think you should.  Tell your parents to forget it and stand firm.  What kind of mother says but for me, forget my kids. These people are toxic.  Remind them that it\u2019s not your responsibility to support the golden child.  This just hit a nerve.", "Jesus...NTA. Your family sounds so entitled.", "NTA. She wants a free machine and that's an unreasonable demand. Help her get a loan instead.", "NTA. That's ridiculous. Some paper or blades, sure, but not the entire cricut machine!", "I think it's better you consider this as trash taking itself out. Do send the kids presents if you still wish to. But as they say, don't negotiate with you know who's\n\nNTA. Don't take it to heart, she's trying to guilt trip you into paying for her \"business\".", "NTA\n\nHubby is right, so are you. \n\nShe gave you the middle finger?  No gift for her. Take a step back from this.   \n\nWhy isn't your mom and stepdad buying it?", "NTA. Call your sister back and tell her you need to borrow $300 to get your nephews gifts since you\u2019re buying her a $400 circuit and can\u2019t afford to and family helps family. You don\u2019t want to crush their dreams!", "Clearly nta, why did she ask you to buy the most expensive thing? You can clearly gift her materials- like for 50 bucks\u2026", "NTA, obviously. It would be different had she asked you to pitch in for a 400$ machine, but she wants you to outright buy it.\nAlso, you would be the only one not helping? Family can't help family? What do they think covering your sister's bills is?\nTbh, your sister, step dad and mom all suck and they sound insufferable.", "NTA. Your sister sold the bear skin way before she even had a weapon or hunting license.", "NTA. I find it absurd that Lil Sis \"started a business\" and took pre-orders when she didn't have the necessary equipment or material. Does she even know if she likes weeding and doing vinyl etc? \n\nAs a chronic crafter, I quickly determined I hated it. I sold my stuff and went back to sending my ideas to my lovely friend who has a successful vinyl business. \n\nLil Sis should check the local library to see if they have a cutter she can use while she gets her business going. Or fb marketplace. \n\nAgain, NTA.", "So your sister had a kid at age 15 and has needed support ever since, and somehow thinks its perfectly normal to demand you also fund her business?
