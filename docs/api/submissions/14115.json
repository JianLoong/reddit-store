It's fine you and your husband don't want to eat meat but you shouldn't be forcing that on your kids when they don't want to be apart of that lifestyle. They have a right or should have a right to choose their own lifestyle. It doesn't have to line up with yours. Let your kid prepare their own food if that's what they want. It's not going to hurt you for them to prepare it and eat it around you.\n\nEdit: would also like to add, how is your kid going to learn the basic life skill on cooking for herself when she gets on her own? If she can't learn how to cook what she likes at home then how is she then going to be able to cook what she likes? Also, not to mention, since you controlled where your husband can eat what he likes, no wonder he is vegetarian like you because where else is he supposed to eat the foods he likes? He is basically just eating what you eat to please you and to pretty much eat what he gets to eat. I don't care what someone else eats but I'm sure not going to control where and when they can eat the foods they like.

Vegetarian/vegan meals are quite nutritious.

She can eat meat, just not in her house.", "You think extensive craving is not a sign of a lack in certain nutrition?\n\nI know vegan and vegetarian diet can be as healthy or healthier than an omnivore diet but we do not actually know their diet and if it is appropriate for a 12 year old.\n\nThat being said, I would not deny a certain food from my child just because of my believes.", "As long as you clean up after yourself, there shouldn't be cross contamination. They will be fine unless they don't clean their dishes and cookware after each use and in that case, there would be a ton of cross contamination and could potentially get sick. Otherwise, they will be fine.", "No need for name calling. Don\u2019t be an AH!", "For me it does. Im vegetarian, my family is not. I just wash the dishes and that\u2019s it", "It\u2019s a mental thing I suspect. I\u2019ve seen my vegan friend lose her mind when her mom borrowed her cutting board because she swore that even after multiple washes she could smell the meat juice on her plastic cutting board.", "It's not tainted unless they don't actually wash their dishes with soap and water like you are supposed to or even not washing them at all. There is nothing wrong with eating meat or other foods on any dish that has been washed properly. Even with an allergy. The only thing with an allergy is is depending on the severity like with some people with peanuts, they can't be anywhere near it. But there isn't an allergy to be dealt with in this post.", "You should look up meat vs milk in a Jewish household. \n\nIt\u2019s a religious reason why most orthodox houses have red or blue colored duplicates of everything in their kitchen. What it boils down to is that the two shall never meet. Meat utensils go with meat. Milk utensils will go with meat and never the two shall cross paths. \n\nAs far as veganism and vegetarianism and \u201cmeat tainted pans\u201d some claim to taste the residue meat leaves behind but it\u2019s really up to the person how they perceive products to be tainted and when they\u2019re \u201cclean\u201d.\n\nEdit: \u201cMeat Taint\u201d would be a good punk band name.", "If someone took a shot on your pan. Would you just wash it and use it?\nIt's an animal carcass. It's gross", "That escalated quickly", "Oh, come on, neither of them was forced not to eat meat! They were just forbidden from making it! Absolutely two different things! /s in case someone takes that seriously", "How exactly is it abuse? Do you know anything about how this family eats? Are you their doctor or dietician?", "It is not very normal for parents to tell kids they can\u2019t prepare their own food. \n\nIn fact once kids reach a certain age many parents will actually tell kids \u201cyou can eat was cooked or you can make something for yourself.\u201d In this case OP\u2019s daughter is willing to make the food herself but OP has a problem with that too.", "It\u2019s very normal for parents to tell their kids to eat way they\u2019re served even if the food is very unhealthy and leaves the child without proper nutrition. \n\nI fixed it for you :)", ">Do you know what a step it is to allow your child to eat something SO repugnant to you?\n\nit's not the end of the world. Some foods make me ill to think about eating, one of my kids freaking loves those foods, so I buy and prepare them for her and get over myself cos my aversions are mine alone.", "Ok how about I forbid you prepare vegetables in your home? Is it that offensive to not eat vegetables all the time?\n\nI love vegetables btw.", "No one has an issue with OP being vegetarian, the problem is that OP has forced **HER** diet choices on her family and banned meat from the house regardless of what others in her family want.\n\nNo one is saying that being vegetarian is bad, but being controlling is.", "It can be a sign of malnutrition, but that flags absolutely nowhere in this post. \n\nChild is not being blanket-denied anything. She is allowed to eat meat. Just not at home. \n\nAlso, I'm absolutely not throwing bouquets at OP. Vegetarianism is a height of hypocrisy, imo, to be cognizant of the cruelty of meat farming and blind to the even worse cruelties of dairy and egg farming (ESPECIALLY in the US, which bc of Reddit audience bias I assume they are, even though I'm not) I just don't get how \"My roof, my rules\" applies in other scenarios but not here.", "I don't see non vegetarians pull this kind of shi", "Thank you for being a rational human.", "Just came to talk about plastic boards. \n\nShe probably could as plastic boards surfaces are easily scratched by knives which allows the food to stay in them.\n\nTry cutting some ginger or garlic on them and then wash multiple times. Give it to someone who doesn't know what was cut on it and they probably can pick it up.", "I mean, you are supposed to use different boards for meat and vegetables anyway", ">Meat utensils go with meat. Milk utensils will go with ~~meat~~ milk and never the two shall cross paths.\n\nFTFY - relevant typo.", "I'd kill for meat (pun intended).", "Out of curiosity, what is it about a vegetarian diet that you feel is unhealthy?\nAssuming this means largely plant based, potentially eggs and cheese. \n\nWhat is it that you think meat provides that nothing else can (that you can't add to the diet via supplements)..?\n\nI personally eat meat as part of my balanced diet, so I'm not against it. I also studied nutrition and nutritional biochemistry at university though, and whilst it can be difficult to meet nutritional requirements on a vegan diet, it's actually not that hard on a vegetarian diet.", "American?", "I have food aversions too. I don't mean just \"the smell makes me sick\" I mean \"I live my life morally objecting to this\".", "Nope, false equivalence (as ye are sooo good at) because vegetables are somewhat essential for nutrition in some form. Meat isn't. Also I am an adult, and as a child I got close to zero say in foods I ate especially since money was tight. It was eat what's in front of you or don't eat.\n\nETA: Also, why would you ban me making vegetables in MY home? Lol. If I am the owner/renter I make the rules.", "Abstaining from animal flesh or products is not a diet.\n\nETA: Would you call a Jewish or Muslim parent who refused to let their prepubescent child bring pork into the house shitty for this?", "I'm allergic to wheat and have a chronic pain/inflammatory disorder that means my reactions to allergens can last up to 2 weeks. If I wash a plastic cutting board with hot soap and water or put it in the dishwasher, I will not get sick if wheat was on it prior to proper washing. \n\nGarlic and ginger are also substantially more pungent than raw meat. If you're really worried about the smell, snaitize the cutting board with a sanitizing spray, then wash it with hot water and soap. Soak it in the sink with dishsoap, if needed. None of my cutting boards ever smelled like ginger or garlic after being thoroughly washed. Plastic stuff tends to retain the smell/taste of dishsoap more than anything. Have you ever been overzealous washing the top of a travel mug and had it tasted like soap even after rinsing for a few minutes? I don't have the same issue with smell lingering if I make tea with fresh ginger.", "Very astute! It\u2019s Absolute American to force unhealthy food  on children!", "What would you say if the family was not vegetarian and basically force the daughter to eat meat every day when she wanted to be vegetarian?", "Agreed, the smell can be removed. Just wanted to point out it is possible to smell the meat on a cutting board if its not washed thoroughly and the person is sensitive to smell.\n\nI myself am a non-vegeterian and wasn't saying its impossible to remove.", "That would be a completely different scenario and not just because I'm bending the rules to suit myself; hear me out for a second. Meat is absolutely not complete nutrition, so the other foods (aka, PLANT foods) would be still edible or available in the house.\n\nIf no other protein, of ANY KIND was made available to this child, I would absolutely hate that morally and I would consider those parents shitty but ultimately I can't come in their house and call them AH for it. \n\nAlso, again, false equivalence, because whether ye like to hear it or not the realities of animal farming *are* abusive and cruel no matter if factory farming or a local guy who kisses his cows on the head before slitting their throats. So there is a moral level here that can not, ever, apply in the other direction."]}
