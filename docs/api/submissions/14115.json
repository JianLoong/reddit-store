It's fine you and your husband don't want to eat meat but you shouldn't be forcing that on your kids when they don't want to be apart of that lifestyle. They have a right or should have a right to choose their own lifestyle. It doesn't have to line up with yours. Let your kid prepare their own food if that's what they want. It's not going to hurt you for them to prepare it and eat it around you.\n\nEdit: would also like to add, how is your kid going to learn the basic life skill on cooking for herself when she gets on her own? If she can't learn how to cook what she likes at home then how is she then going to be able to cook what she likes? Also, not to mention, since you controlled where your husband can eat what he likes, no wonder he is vegetarian like you because where else is he supposed to eat the foods he likes? He is basically just eating what you eat to please you and to pretty much eat what he gets to eat. I don't care what someone else eats but I'm sure not going to control where and when they can eat the foods they like.

Vegetarian/vegan meals are quite nutritious. Do a little research and educate yourselves. \n\nYou\u2019re not an A-H for not wanting to smell meat in your house, and your daughter\u2019s not an A-H for wanting to cook something of her choice.

The natural point for kids to divert from what they grew up with is when you learn to cook, which is why -as you say- op should try harder to compromise.

I have exaggerated the cases which apply, but if something was banned from the home for religious reasons, I'd still find it shitty towards the child that may not be an active participant of that religion.\n\nOP has sensory issues. Her reason for not allowing meat in the house is, first and foremost, because she cannot PHYSICALLY deal with it. The reasons that led to that food aversion don't really matter in that context because those same reasons aren't applied elsewhere. OP is not objecting to the morality of having meat in the house, either. Reading the post, I gathered the impression that OP would be fine with meat being prepared in her home if she hadn't developed an aversion, so that when she made the decision to ban meat, it wasn't based on her moral views but rather based on practicality for her.\n\nAs for the third point: This is one particular kind of food that Sam would like to prepare for herself, probably because she either thinks the food she gets at school could need improvement or because there is something that she likes in particular but that she doesn't get to eat too often. Again, it's not a big deal, but it's just something that's unfair (based on the circumstances around it, not because OP is unreasonable), but I'd like to see OP to try and come up with solutions that would enable her daughter to cook something that she really likes to cook for herself once in a while, akin to the suggestions already listed (having a dedicated meat set of dishes, OP leaving home for a while once a week or once every week). Because if these things work for OP, that's an easier and cheaper solution than going out for dinner.\n\nIf OP cannot overcome her sensory issues, and cannot deal with the lingering smell, I'd say she made an effort to try and accomodate her child, but it cannot be helped.

I am incredibly (note:INCREDIBLY) wary of the health issues argument not because I disbelieve people about their health, but because doctors are usually extremely ill informed about plant based diets. I am not a dietician but I have 4 years of formal medical education about nutrition, and during both that and my own medical experiences I have come across so much misinformation. I myself have been warned by about 6 health professionals to eat meat, and the only reason I don't do that is because once I insist on blood tests etc not one of them can point out anything wrong with my nutrition. Forgive me, I believe you but I struggle with this. \n\nWith your experience I'm sure you are able to note the difference between forced compliance and simply not allowing a dead animal inside the house when this child does not have the health issues you have. Nobody is calling this child unclean or something. They let her do it and don't criticise her for it.

It's not religious to do the groundwork, find quality peer-reviewed studies that show the health negatives of consuming animal products and wonder hey, maybe I can be healthy without these. \n\nI brought up religion earlier in the thread to compare the situation, maybe I shouldn't have.
