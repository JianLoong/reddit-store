It's fine you and your husband don't want to eat meat but you shouldn't be forcing that on your kids when they don't want to be apart of that lifestyle. They have a right or should have a right to choose their own lifestyle. It doesn't have to line up with yours. Let your kid prepare their own food if that's what they want. It's not going to hurt you for them to prepare it and eat it around you.\n\nEdit: would also like to add, how is your kid going to learn the basic life skill on cooking for herself when she gets on her own? If she can't learn how to cook what she likes at home then how is she then going to be able to cook what she likes? Also, not to mention, since you controlled where your husband can eat what he likes, no wonder he is vegetarian like you because where else is he supposed to eat the foods he likes? He is basically just eating what you eat to please you and to pretty much eat what he gets to eat. I don't care what someone else eats but I'm sure not going to control where and when they can eat the foods they like.

Vegetarian/vegan meals are quite nutritious.

I have exaggerated the cases which apply, but if something was banned from the home for religious reasons, I'd still find it shitty towards the child that may not be an active participant of that religion.\n\nOP has sensory issues. Her reason for not allowing meat in the house is, first and foremost, because she cannot PHYSICALLY deal with it. The reasons that led to that food aversion don't really matter in that context because those same reasons aren't applied elsewhere. OP is not objecting to the morality of having meat in the house, either. Reading the post, I gathered the impression that OP would be fine with meat being prepared in her home if she hadn't developed an aversion, so that when she made the decision to ban meat, it wasn't based on her moral views but rather based on practicality for her.\n\nAs for the third point: This is one particular kind of food that Sam would like to prepare for herself, probably because she either thinks the food she gets at school could need improvement or because there is something that she likes in particular but that she doesn't get to eat too often. Again, it's not a big deal, but it's just something that's unfair (based on the circumstances around it, not because OP is unreasonable), but I'd like to see OP to try and come up with solutions that would enable her daughter to cook something that she really likes to cook for herself once in a while, akin to the suggestions already listed (having a dedicated meat set of dishes, OP leaving home for a while once a week or once every week). Because if these things work for OP, that's an easier and cheaper solution than going out for dinner.\n\nIf OP cannot overcome her sensory issues, and cannot deal with the lingering smell, I'd say she made an effort to try and accomodate her child, but it cannot be helped.

I am not a dietician but I have 4 years of formal medical education about nutrition, and during both that and my own medical experiences I have come across so much misinformation. I myself have been warned by about 6 health professionals to eat meat, and the only reason I don't do that is because once I insist on blood tests etc not one of them can point out anything wrong with my nutrition. Forgive me, I believe you but I struggle with this. \n\nWith your experience I'm sure you are able to note the difference between forced compliance and simply not allowing a dead animal inside the house when this child does not have the health issues you have.

Why does the daughter have the right to make her mother emotionally and physically uncomfortable and break her ethical boundary?\n\nThe girl can get meat at school or wherever else she pleases. OP just refuses to have it in the house. It's not an unfair expectation. \n\nIf this is unfair on the kid because \"her eating meat shouldn't physically affect OP\" (even though it does physically affect her), then tons of rules we impose on children are \"unfair\". My kid wants to play videogames 10 hours a day? It would be unfair to limit him to 2 and make him get some exercise. He wants to stay out late with friends? Well it doesn't directly affect me, so I can't set a curfew. Doing such things would just be imposing my beliefs on to them, and that's an unfair expectation after all. \n\nIt's OP's home and she has a right to be comfortable in it. \"No meat in the house\" is a firm boundary and crossing it will make her feel uncomfortable. Her daughter doesn't _need_ meat. She is not uncomfortable without it. She doesn't retch at the smell of \"not cooking meat\". She doesn't have deep ethical problems with \"not eating meat\". She can get her meat anywhere else, and OP may disapprove but won't try to stop her. But at home, she gets to decide what she lets in the house. This is already a reasonable compromise, if OP were TA, she'd be trying to stop her daughter eating meat outside the home as well.", "That is not the same as a kid wanting to eat and learn how to cook which is a basic life skill everyone should and one I wish I was able to learn. I'm an omnivore but I wouldn't control a child who wants to be a vegetarian in my house. I would encourage them to learn how to eat the foods they like and help them anyway I can to learn so they can take care of themselves when they are grown and their future family as a parent should. Not be controlling. Sorry not sorry.", "Not teaching someone how to cook meat doesn't mean that they aren't teaching them how to cook period.  Are observant Jewish people \"not teaching their kids to cook\" because they aren't teaching them how to cook pork?", "You keep bringing up ethics when the OP never once mentioned ethics being the reason why she's vegetarian.\n\nImagine if the roles were reversed and the child was vegetarian but her mother wouldn't allow anyone to cook vegetables in her home because she doesn't like the smell. What if her daughter is also autistic and doesn't like the texture of vegetables? \n\nAnd comparing eating meat to playing video games for 10 hours a day is completely disingenuous.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, yes, her daughter is being forced to be vegetarian when eating at home, which is where most kids eat most of their meals. Eating cold lunch meat at school or some grade C meat products served by the school isn't even comparable.", "Nice non sequitur. The OP never once mentioned ethics regarding her choice of vegetarianism. And it's not like the kid is asking to bring animals home to slaughter them, so that's a disingenuous comparison. And the entire beastiality thing is just a hilariously stupid comparison.\n\nHumans evolved to be omnivores. It's not unnatural to eat meat.", "I'm sure god will clap his hands because he's so proud of you paying people to masturbate, rape, torture, and kill sentient animals. \n\nWhy do you think god gave animals the ability to feel pain?", "So ingredients that every vegetable has. You might want to check why eggs are rich in B12 and I definitely wouldn't consider it natural", "The environmental effects are vastly overstated any way, which makes those reasons laughable anyway. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Do you think India is communist??", "Yes, it is. All necessary nutrients can be obtained from plant based sources (and dairy/eggs, hence not sure about veganism as haven't researched it).\n\nLooking at literally any medically verified source on this will provide you with this information. E.g., https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegetarian-diet/\n\nA *proper* vegetarian diet is nutritionally complete.\n\nI'd like to see any source you have for the differences between adults and children as regards this diet, as I doubt that is true.\n\nI'd even go as far as to speculate whether the average meat eaters diet is less nutritional than the average vegetarians, simply because they are less likely to be conscious about balancing it having not made any dietary choices. However, not having any sources I can't say for sure.", "Well please go on about the ample supplements needed and how poor the bioavailablity of most nutrients in plant products are? \nI'd love to know as a person who's been vegetarian since 6yrs old and only took 1 multivitamin a day to supplement meat. Then having to make it 1 multivitamin every 2 days cause I had too high of an iron and b12 count.", "She just seems to think it's yummy which is completely fine. You apparantly need an MD to understand that a child can grow just fine on a vegetarian diet. Many food agencies around the world consider it equally good as a diet with meat for a growing child.", "It\u2019s a good thing everyone isn\u2019t like this or mankind would have never evolved and moved out of caves.", ">Three humans live in that house, and only one human gets to set the rules,\n\nOr two, since you don't even know if the father is in complete agreement. He's also apparently a vegetarian, and we do not know his current reasons for it. He may be in complete agreement with his wife here. \n\n>that doesn\u2019t seem right,and using curfew as an analogy is a poor choice curfews or rules are put in place for the safety of everyone,\n\nThey're put in place for the safety of the kid, which the kids disagree with. It's unlikely any particular \"harm\" will come to them if they game \"too much\", but it's still an acceptable limit to set, why?\n\n> and even those could be discussed and compromises made.\n\nAnd maybe compromises like \"eating out more often\" or \"cooking outside\" can be made, but fundamentally, OP is still then NTA for having this boundary in her own home. Her right to be comfortable both physically and emotionally in her own home overrides the daughters _want_ of eating meat at home, especially when there's other options of eating meat that she already utilises.", ">OP could help her daughter navigate adding meat to her diet and choosing higher quality, more humane options.  \n\nWhy the fuck should a vegetarian, who has serious ethical problems with eating meat, be expected to help navigate this? That's forcing her to do something she actively does not want to do\n\n>People have made some good suggestions - cooking outside, OP leaving the house for a few hours while daughter and husband cook on separate pans and clean, budgeting to allow daughter to eat out higher quality meat weekly (and maybe that means just daughter is eating out, not everyone.)\n\nI agree, there are solutions (outside of letting her cook in the house, that is something I would not allow). None of that means that OP is TA for refusing to allow meat inside the house. It's an ethical issue and a sensory one. As a vegetarian, it's completely reasonable to refuse to have meat in the house. You shouldn't be expected to break your ethics just because someone else _wants_ something in your home.\n\nHaving meat inside the house makes OP deeply uncomfortable both from an ethical stand point and physically due to sensory issues. Why does the daughter have the right to make her mother uncomfortable just because she _wants_ to eat meat at home? She doesn't _need_ to eat meat. She's not got any problems with not eating meat. She doesn't have physical reactions to non-meat food being cooked. \n\n \n\n>Ultimately the daughter is 12 and still needs parents support and guidance. I think op is an AH for thinking they\u2019re so great for not banning daughter from eating the shit meat at school.  Like that\u2019s a really low bar and doesn\u2019t make Op a good parent.\n\nThis is irrelevant. OP doesn't think she's \"so great\" for that. She's just noting that she cannot control what happens outside the house. How does this make her TA? She's allowed to set boundaries inside her home.\n\nLet's take a hypothetical: say you're afraid of clowns, and your kid, for whatever reason, wants to be a clown. Are you TA for saying they can't wear/practice being a clown around the house (excepting their room) because it makes you uncomfortable? Or is that an example of \"my house, my rules\" that is acceptable despite being over an irrational phobia rather than a real ethical problem with the meat industry and physical sensory issues with meat?", "Wow that\u2019s a horrible argument, having healthy boundaries with stuff like gaming and hanging out with friends is a good thing. \n\nForcing a vegetarian diet on her daughter with no solution for the daughter to explore her own diet is insane. The kid is providing more helpful solutions than the mom which is embarrassing for a grown women. Why should her daughter be so impacted by her moms sensory issues when the obvious solution is to just let her cook meat using separate pans or on a BBQ outside.", "That sort of \"my house, my rules\" attitude makes you a poor parent, dude.\n\nAt this point, it isn't a compromise at all. She doesn't get to dictate what the daughter eats, at all, not at this age,and not in terms of \"meat/no meat\".\n\nIt's the daughter's home too, and the Dad's, and mommy is being selfish.\n\nMind, I was raised in a \"my house, my rules\" family - except, if I could point the inherent unfairness or double standards in the rules, my parents, being reasonable people, would change their stance.", "It's still a basic life skill that everyone should learn. Doesn't matter the type of food. People should still learn.", ">You keep bringing up ethics when the OP never once mentioned ethics being the reason why she's vegetarian.\n\nLearn to read: \n\n>but I am just against factory farming and the environmental impact of meat diets, and I figure if there is one way I can help, it is that way\n\n>Imagine if the roles were reversed and the child was vegetarian but her mother wouldn't allow anyone to cook vegetables in her home because she doesn't like the smell. What if her daughter is also autistic and doesn't like the texture of vegetables? \n\nDumb hypotheticals are dumb, and in fact there are already a ton of instances on AITA where when a kid wants to be vegetarian, the parents are told NTA for not accomodating them. So go off.\n\n>And comparing eating meat to playing video games for 10 hours a day is completely disingenuous.\n\nExplain why.\n\n>When it comes down to it, yes, her daughter is being forced to be vegetarian when eating at home, which is where most kids eat most of their meals. \n\nI don't care anymore. She doesn't have the right to make her mother uncomfortable in her own home more than the mother gets to lay down rules about what's allowed in the house.", "Humans also evolved the ability to rape people, so it's not unnatural to do so? Also rape, incest, and genital stimulation are all parts of the meat industry. It's not even a comparison.\n\n If we evolved to be omnivores then you know we can survive off plants so why continue to pay for animal cruelty when we know it's wrong?", "God gave us animals to eat.

I answered.", "LOL you're welcome to your opinion but that doesn't mean others will ignore data bc you cherry pick what suits your POV.", "Absolutely it makes you TA in the clown scenario. It is the responsibility of the parent to help encourage the child\u2019s development in safe ways. Child development and exploration > parental discomfort. If need be, the parent can arrange accommodations so they wouldn\u2019t be exposed to the clown stuff as much as possible but being a parent is supposed to mean putting your child\u2019s needs and growth ahead of your personal comforts and preferences.

If you want to get pedantic, that already _is_ a compromise: if she was going to be the asshole, she'd be trying to stop her daughter having meat outside the house too. \n\nPeople are allowed to have these beliefs that they don't compromise on in their home. This doesn't make them an asshole. OP has major ethical issues and sensory issues with meat. Daughter is allowed to eat meat elsewhere. She does not _need_ to eat meat inside the house. She is not made uncomfortable by not eating meat inside the house.

She's enforcing the damn common parenting trick of \"my house, my rules\". Daughter can get her meat fix anywhere else, but OP refusing to sacrifice her morals and comfort _inside her own home_ does not make her controlling not ridiculous. Daughter does not _need_ to eat meat. She is not made uncomfortable by not eating meat. She has no ethical or sensory problems with not eating meat. While she lives under her parents roof, she has to abide by their rules. And as rules go, \"no meat in the house\" from vegetarian parents is a pretty fucking reasonable one."]}
