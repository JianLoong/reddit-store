BIG MISTAKE.\n\nShe asked my why I didnt like it. I said i just dont find children that cute. And so these kind of shows are never interesting to me.\n\nSHE WENT BALLISTIC. She started asking me what Im gonna do when I have children of my own. I told her I dont want kids anyways. BIGGER MISTAKE.\n\nShe started going off about how I had to have kids. And get married. IDK man weird shit.\n\nAnyways left their place shortly after and went to my maternal grandparents' house. Everything was chill before my grandpa pulled me aside suddenly and asked me if i had a girlfriend. I told him no.  He said good and told me to not have a relationship while I'm in university. I said OK cause I didnt wanna make a scene. He then told me that he had some views about who/ what type of person will be my partner in the future. WHAT? WHAT IS HAPPENNING??!\n\nI didnt say anything cause an argument with an 85 year old man is the last thing i needed right then.. \n\nSo i came back home and later that night and told my mom what had happened at both places.  She was like,\" Well you know, they're old and set in their views. Don't think about it too much, they probably just want whats best for you.\" \n\nI told her I couldn't understand that and that they have no right over my future or who i can/should date/be with. \n\nThen she freaked out and asked me if SHE had no say in my relationships. I told her that i respect her and her opinions but that she doesnt have jurisdiction over my love life or if i have kids etc.\n\nShe freaked out even more and went on a rant.

Our situations are different, but the same outcome of likely never having children was the thing that upset my family, more than who my partner ever was.

Then, \u201cI want to buy a house and have a stable career before I think about that\u201d. That\u2019ll buy you years of time.  It sounds like they want to match-make for you to find someone. Avoid that. Tell them you are meeting people and just waiting until you\u2019re more established.\n\nWhen you do date someone, all of that anger about not wanting kids will be directed at them from your family. It\u2019s a future hypothetical, but you need someone on board with that.\n\nIn my situation, living further away and keeping who I dated private from my family helped.
