I'm staying at my parents' house for the time I'm here. \n\nI went to visit my maternal and paternal grandparents a few days ago and that's where it all started. While I was at my paternal grandparents' house, they had a show going on on the tv. I dont remember what the show was exactly but it had children competing for something. Anyways, at some point the conversation turned to how cute she (my grandma) finds the children and that she likes the show so much cause of them. I  told her that I didnt find it that interesting. BIG MISTAKE.\n\nShe asked my why I didnt like it. I said i just dont find children that cute. And so these kind of shows are never interesting to me.\n\nSHE WENT BALLISTIC. She started asking me what Im gonna do when I have children of my own. I told her I dont want kids anyways. BIGGER MISTAKE.\n\nShe started going off about how I had to have kids. And get married. IDK man weird shit.\n\nAnyways left their place shortly after and went to my maternal grandparents' house. Everything was chill before my grandpa pulled me aside suddenly and asked me if i had a girlfriend. I told him no.  He said good and told me to not have a relationship while I'm in university. I said OK cause I didnt wanna make a scene. He then told me that he had some views about who/ what type of person will be my partner in the future. WHAT? WHAT IS HAPPENNING??!\n\nI didnt say anything cause an argument with an 85 year old man is the last thing i needed right then.. \n\nSo i came back home and later that night and told my mom what had happened at both places.  She was like,\" Well you know, they're old and set in their views. Don't think about it too much, they probably just want whats best for you.\" \n\nI told her I couldn't understand that and that they have no right over my future or who i can/should date/be with. \n\nThen she freaked out and asked me if SHE had no say in my relationships. I told her that i respect her and her opinions but that she doesnt have jurisdiction over my love life or if i have kids etc.\n\nShe freaked out even more and went on a rant. I walked off. \n\nIts been a few days now and every word she speaks is cold and occasionally passive aggressive. I cant deal with this. I feel like a piece of  shit.

That\u2019s a very direct, western (white) perspective that might not fit in other cultures. You need to make some sort of accommodation that lets you decide for your life on what you want, because it sounds like you might be conflicted about going nuclear on your family to establish boundaries.\n\nI was still closeted in university and get how you need to keep what you want in life to yourself because your family might not understand at first. Our situations are different, but the same outcome of likely never having children was the thing that upset my family, more than who my partner ever was. My family viewed children as a path to happiness and it took years to show them I can be safe and happy with out them.\n\nJust say, \u201cI want to wait until I have finished my schooling and have a partner (better to say wife given how traditional they sounds) to think about kids\u201d.  This is all true, you do want to wait but waiting isn\u2019t likely to change your mind. Just keep saying that you want to wait for the \u201cright person\u201d and things like that. Then, \u201cI want to buy a house and have a stable career before I think about that\u201d. That\u2019ll buy you years of time.  It sounds like they want to match-make for you to find someone. Avoid that. Tell them you are meeting people and just waiting until you\u2019re more established.\n\nWhen you do date someone, all of that anger about not wanting kids will be directed at them from your family. It\u2019s a future hypothetical, but you need someone on board with that.\n\nIn my situation, living further away and keeping who I dated private from my family helped. Dating someone outside your culture is also something that helped me. My family has come around but again, my culture has made my circumstances easier.", "NTA. You're only 20.", "NTA \n\nI can understand your grandparents' opinions, they're old fashioned and probably assume every red-blooded male wants a wife and kids, and that they have a right to question you about your future relationships. Your mother's response on the other hand, and assuming this isn't a culture/tradition thing, just seems weird. \n\nIt's normal to want your parents to like your partner, but maybe your mum thought that you would seek her approval and that her opinion would carry some weight, and now she's upset that that isn't the case. But she shouldn't have assumed it was going to happen in the first place.", "NTA, It's your life you get to decide what you want and don't want.

I don't get why the mom freaked out lol", "NTA - Choose your own life, surround yourself with people who love and respect you, treat the people around you with respect and enjoy. If they can't find their way to respecting you and your boundaries, cut them off until they do.", "Lordy NTA but you jumped into the fire from the frying pan here with both feet. I'm sorry but this has got to be one of the more humorous how the ef did I get here stories. Your grandparents will let up eventually, your mom however make take longer. While yes you are technically and adult it is harder for our parents to let go of the sense of control they have had over your life than it looks from the outside. I'm sorry but this is not unusual you're still kind of in that in between stage where you see yourself as an adult and fully autonomous, and parents see you as still needing guidance as they are paying the bills, and providing for you. Right now moms feelings are hurt because you said you don't need her and that is a gut punch to any mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a Thai bf (older than me) who took me to every family event as a friend/roommate. Everyone knew we were partners and never said anything.  His family even stayed in touch with my family after we broke up. My sister hangs out with his mom and I helped them house shopping. I was more accepted by them even though we weren\u2019t out than I was by my white bf\u2019s parents to whom we were out.  \n\nI kind of expected to be yelled out at a lot for the comment, so thanks for getting it.", "> expected to be yelled out\n\nwhat! no! thank you for the reply.  \n\n\\~families\\~ am i right?"]}
