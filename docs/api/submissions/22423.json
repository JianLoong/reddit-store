This family sounds awful. Why would anyone get pregnant on purpose to join it?", "I don\u2019t have a judgment but what kind of screwed up family did you marry yourself into?\nHoly crap.", "Info: so....rich inlaws?", "This is whole family and situation is just extremely weird to me. But ultimately NTA you just explained your experience. It takes 2 to make a baby and you aren\u2019t either of those parties.", "ESH\n\nThis family sounds like a mess.", "Well, ain\u2019t this a whole passel of assholes? \n\nESH", "INFO, the post is too vague for me make a full judgment. What was your exact comment? What were your in-laws opinion of you, did they give any actual reasons for the their disapproval? How old are you now and when did you get married?", "Esh. Your in-laws suck for obvious reasons, but you really should have used better judgement about what you said. Teenagers aren\u2019t known for their logical thinking, so proposing something like that was kind of playing with fire. \n\nI would just tell your in-laws that you made a joke and didn\u2019t think it would be taken so seriously.", "Yta.  You gave extremely bad advice to a teenager and when she acted on it and outed you, you tried to backpedal by claiming it was a joke. You basically present your situation as a success and then tried to claim it wasn't a serious suggestion. You know the family dynamics and you essentially told the girl to manipulate/babytrap the boy and his family. Because it worked for you. Wink wink. Hardy har har. Sooooooo funny/s", "NTA. Not sure how you're responsible for these two using birth control. The in-laws never changed their mind about you and are now using you as a scapegoat instead of holding their son responsible for not using a condom. Further, Sydney already knew what happened to you; it wouldn't have mattered if you said anything to her or not. She drew her own conclusions and you didn't say she was mentally impaired in any way. So the parents made their own bed here with treating YOU that way in the first place. Maybe they should have just been nice.", "YTA - Be confident and take responsibility for what you say instead backing out with, \"I obviously wasn\u2019t being serious.\"  The various family dynamics will spiral around you throughout life and you are solely responsible for your actions; no one else.", "Yta. Sounds like the family was probably right about that girlfriend. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for them to be mad at you to be telling the story about your pregnancy even if it\u2019s your story to tell.", "Unpopular opinion but NTA your brother in law is old enough to have sex then he's old enough to know to bring his own protection and always use it", "Rofl. She may not have even gotten pregnant on purpose but is using that comment to justify it. Either way YTA. You put that out there when you shouldn\u2019t have.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
