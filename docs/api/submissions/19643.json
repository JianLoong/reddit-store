We don't have kids and we are not planning on having them. Both of us work 5 days a week, but my days off are always Thursday and Friday, while his days off varies from week to week, so our days off don't always match and it's possible that they don't match for weeks or even a couple of months if we are unlucky enough.\n\nSo, last week my BF's days off were Friday and Saturday, and mine as usual were Thursday and Friday, which meant both of us were free on Friday and we were pretty excited to enjoy our day off together. It was our first day off together since we moved together. We didn't have anything planned, but I was looking forward to laze around with him the entire day.\n\nFriday, at 2AM I received a call from my best friend (F29), she was crying because her husband (he is a truck driver) was in a traffic accident. The accident was in a city 8 hours away, and he was taken to the nearest hospital in a really bad shape. My friend said she and her MIL wanted to leave to the hospital right now so they could be there by mid-morning. My best friend has a ten months old son, and she said she obviously can't get a hold of her usual babysitter at 2AM, so she asked me if I can watch her son for a few hours until she can reach her babysitter.\n\nNow, I'm also not a huge fan of kids, specially babies, I don't know how to deal with them, but this was an emergency and I understand it's probably impossible to get a babysitter at 2AM. My friend had never asked me to baby sit before as she knows I'm not good with kids, but this is an emergency and what are friends for right? So, I said yes and I told her she could drop the baby at my place.\n\nAs soon as I disconnected the call my boyfriend told me he couldn't believe I agreed to babysit and that he didn't want a screaming baby in our house, that it would ruin his day. I agreed he shouldn't be forced to interact with the kid against his will, after all I was the one that agreed to babysit, so I called my friend and told her I will babysit at her place instead.\n\nMy boyfriend got angry at me again, but I left anyway and went to my friend\u2019s place. My friend called the babysitter at 8AM, but she said she wasn't available until noon. So, I ended up babysitting from 2AM until noon. When I returned to my place, my boyfriend was still angry at me. He said I ruined our day off together as I was missing half the day to go babysit a kid that's not even mine. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help my friend.\n\nHe has been ignoring me since Friday, he said it was clear to me my best friend is more important than him as I picked helping her over spending the day with him. I told him it was not matter of who is more important, but he is still upset.\n\nI understand I missed half a day off with him and that we might not get another for a few weeks, but I think it was a special circumstance, my best friend needed my help.

NTA.", "NTA, but you definitely need to replace the BF if he's getting that upset that you're helping a friend in a desperate situation.\n\nYou did the right thing and you still had half a day to spend with him, he ruined that half of the day with his selfishness. If he wants to blame you for ruining the first half, blame him for the second half.", "NTA Your bf is self centred and only cares about his wants and needs. The fact he can\u2019t even show enough empathy in an emergency like this is extremely worrying. These are huge red flags and I hope you get yourself out of this relationship.", "NTA. I'm proud of my husband when he is a good friend, even if it could be a little more convenient because I love that he is a caring, thoughtful person.

Helping someone for a few hrs in their time of trouble is what a friend does, and a partner is responsible for his other half to take care of you. \n\nConsider this a red flag. There could be a past trauma or something affecting his decision making. \n\nI think if you end up marrying him, he can just leave you when you are sick or in trouble as he doesn't like your friends visiting you at the hospital or something. \n\nSorry to say this, but I would advise you to clear things up before moving ahead with your relationship.", "NTA, and your boyfriend has just given you the gift of showing you who he really is.

If you get sick or need help, I'd be worried he'd be mad at you for messing with his plans and you making your share of the rent.  You went above and beyond respecting his need for peace on his day off and went to your friends and he's mad that you chose to help a friend in an emergency instead of hanging out for a few hours.  Based on your post, he is stone cold.  Is this the quality of person you see yourself with long term?", "NTA\n I'm sorry but this is bringing up a ton of red flags. He is acting incredibly immature. You helped a friend in need and had kept your part of your promise to not force the baby on him. You went to HER apartment and took of the baby there. It's not like the parents were going out to party or date, there was an emergency and no one else was able to care for the child in the meantime. \n I implore you to rethink this relationship, because if this how he acts when he doesn't get his way over something as small as not seeing you for a few hours, I'd rather not stick around when he doesn't get his way for bigger things. RUN!", "NTA, there are few things in life that would excuse this behavior toward your partner. This is clearly one of them. Your partner should grow up a bit.", "Does BF have any real friends? How does he not understand that we help people we care about? Sounds like a jerk.", "Absolutely NTA, also like a lot of other commenters mentioned, this scenario is clearly showing some red flags.\n\nThe blatant lack of compassion and understanding from your SO is kinda appalling, and clearly, he is incredibly selfish to stick to hus argument.\n\nObviously I don't know if he's shown any manipulative or abusive behaviours in the past, but if I were in your shoes, I'd use this situation as an opportunity to get out before his need for control puts you in danger.", "NTA. You two could have hung out after noon, and the rest of the day. Were there already plans for the two of you in place, that were time-sensitive and were missed (like seeing a movie at a certain time, brunch/lunch plans with friends, etc)? \n\nSeems pretty selfish and immature to hold a grudge against you for helping a friend. You even accommodated him by not watching the baby at your place for his sake. Is he the type to not help a friend during an emergency? What if you had an emergency and needed him? Could you count on him? Would he be mad about having to help his own friends or you? Maybe some couples counseling would be a good idea if you want to continue this relationship. Having a mediator can help with conversations about things like this.", "NTA you were doing a huge favour to your friend who was in a time of need. If your boyfriend has a problem with you helping your friends when they need it then I don\u2019t think he is the one", "NTA\u2026how can he be 4 years from 40 and still be this selfish and not understanding? It\u2019s not like any of this was planned\u2026.", "NTA he sounds like a narcissist- no compassion at all for your friend or her husband?! I\u2019d probably use this as an opportunity to make him an ex-bf if I was in your situation. \ud83d\udea9\u26f3\ufe0f\ud83d\udea9\u26f3\ufe0f", "NTA you did it for a real emergency not just because your friend wanted her hair done besides she even set up for you to switch with the babysitter. You may of taken up half the day but your bf made sure to ruin the other half, he chose to stay angry", "NTA\n\nWhere is his empathy for your friend and her family? Even if you don't like someone you still usually feel bad when this stuff happens to them.\n\nHe's really selfish and immature imo. It's overkill to still be upset days later. It seems like he thinks if he punishes you hard enough now in the future you won't step out of line. That would really bother me.\n\nHope your friends hubby is ok.", "NTA\n\nYou are going to need to re-evaluate this relationship though.", "Your BF is a major asshole.

It was a serious situation and your bf couldn\u2019t understand and that\u2019s a huge red flag. If you can\u2019t rely on friends and family what exactly is their purpose? Thank you for being there for your friend. Now consider being there for yourself by getting rid of the guy before you waste any more time on this selfish prick. You deserve better.", "NTA and boo fucking hoo that his day was \u201cruined\u201d. i\u2019m sure your best friend\u2019s day was pretty damn ruined too.", "NTA, u didn\u2019t even need to ask.

This wasn\u2019t some small situation\u2026her husband is seriously injured and in a hospital hours away. You were being a supportive and compassionate friend/human. This was an isolated situation and your bf is acting like you moved a baby permanently. Sounds like your bf is the one who owes you an apology for being a massive insensitive jerk. You do not owe him an apology whatsoever. Relationships are give and take and you should support each other, he should have been supportive in your decision to help a friend.", "NTA.", "What a child.

Your bf is acting selfish and immature.  You can do so much better OP.", "Yta", "You\u2019re NTA, but I wonder if maybe involving him in the decision would have made him feel important. For example: \u201chey babe, friend\u2019s husband was in a bad accident and she needs me to watch her kids until she\u2019s able to get in touch with the babysitter. I know we were planning on having a day together since it\u2019s our first day off in a while, would you want to come help me with the kids? If not I\u2019ll let you know once we get the babysitter lined up and we can do something together when I get back?\u201d \nNavigating schedules can be tough and I\u2019m not condoning his reaction, but simply suggesting involving him in the decision may have made him feel like you acknowledged your day off together would be impacted by your need to help your friend instead of feeling like it w didn\u2019t even occur to you.
