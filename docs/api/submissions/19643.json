We don't have kids and we are not planning on having them. Both of us work 5 days a week, but my days off are always Thursday and Friday, while his days off varies from week to week, so our days off don't always match and it's possible that they don't match for weeks or even a couple of months if we are unlucky enough.\n\nSo, last week my BF's days off were Friday and Saturday, and mine as usual were Thursday and Friday, which meant both of us were free on Friday and we were pretty excited to enjoy our day off together. It was our first day off together since we moved together. We didn't have anything planned, but I was looking forward to laze around with him the entire day.\n\nFriday, at 2AM I received a call from my best friend (F29), she was crying because her husband (he is a truck driver) was in a traffic accident. The accident was in a city 8 hours away, and he was taken to the nearest hospital in a really bad shape. My friend said she and her MIL wanted to leave to the hospital right now so they could be there by mid-morning. My best friend has a ten months old son, and she said she obviously can't get a hold of her usual babysitter at 2AM, so she asked me if I can watch her son for a few hours until she can reach her babysitter.\n\nNow, I'm also not a huge fan of kids, specially babies, I don't know how to deal with them, but this was an emergency and I understand it's probably impossible to get a babysitter at 2AM. My friend had never asked me to baby sit before as she knows I'm not good with kids, but this is an emergency and what are friends for right? So, I said yes and I told her she could drop the baby at my place.\n\nAs soon as I disconnected the call my boyfriend told me he couldn't believe I agreed to babysit and that he didn't want a screaming baby in our house, that it would ruin his day. I agreed he shouldn't be forced to interact with the kid against his will, after all I was the one that agreed to babysit, so I called my friend and told her I will babysit at her place instead.\n\nMy boyfriend got angry at me again, but I left anyway and went to my friend\u2019s place. My friend called the babysitter at 8AM, but she said she wasn't available until noon. So, I ended up babysitting from 2AM until noon. When I returned to my place, my boyfriend was still angry at me. He said I ruined our day off together as I was missing half the day to go babysit a kid that's not even mine. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help my friend.\n\nHe has been ignoring me since Friday, he said it was clear to me my best friend is more important than him as I picked helping her over spending the day with him. I told him it was not matter of who is more important, but he is still upset.\n\nI understand I missed half a day off with him and that we might not get another for a few weeks, but I think it was a special circumstance, my best friend needed my help. AITA?\n\nEdit: \n\nI'm reading all the replies right now. \n\nFor info: Yes, I did told him that my bestie's husband was in an accident.\n\nWe didn't have anything planned except for sleeping in and laze around the entire day.\n\nMy bestie's husband was in ICU until monday morning he was moved to another ward and he is expected to make a full recovery. My friend and her MIL are still by his side.\n\nI didn't need to babysit the baby again after I gave him to the babysitter friday noon, as the baby's other grandma (my friend's mom) flew to our city the next day to pick up her grandkid and the baby is staying with her during this situation.", "created_utc": 1686755952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149aks4/aita_for_agreeing_to_babysit_my_friends_kids_on/", "score": 2512, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you get sick or need help, I'd be worried he'd be mad at you for messing with his plans and you making your share of the rent.  You went above and beyond respecting his need for peace on his day off and went to your friends and he's mad that you chose to help a friend in an emergency instead of hanging out for a few hours.  Based on your post, he is stone cold.  Is this the quality of person you see yourself with long term?", "NTA\n I'm sorry but this is bringing up a ton of red flags. He is acting incredibly immature. You helped a friend in need and had kept your part of your promise to not force the baby on him. You went to HER apartment and took of the baby there. It's not like the parents were going out to party or date, there was an emergency and no one else was able to care for the child in the meantime. \n I implore you to rethink this relationship, because if this how he acts when he doesn't get his way over something as small as not seeing you for a few hours, I'd rather not stick around when he doesn't get his way for bigger things. RUN!", "NTA, there are few things in life that would excuse this behavior toward your partner. This is clearly one of them. Your partner should grow up a bit.", "Does BF have any real friends? How does he not understand that we help people we care about? Sounds like a jerk.", "Absolutely NTA, also like a lot of other commenters mentioned, this scenario is clearly showing some red flags.\n\nThe blatant lack of compassion and understanding from your SO is kinda appalling, and clearly, he is incredibly selfish to stick to hus argument.\n\nObviously I don't know if he's shown any manipulative or abusive behaviours in the past, but if I were in your shoes, I'd use this situation as an opportunity to get out before his need for control puts you in danger.", "NTA. You two could have hung out after noon, and the rest of the day. Were there already plans for the two of you in place, that were time-sensitive and were missed (like seeing a movie at a certain time, brunch/lunch plans with friends, etc)? \n\nSeems pretty selfish and immature to hold a grudge against you for helping a friend. You even accommodated him by not watching the baby at your place for his sake. Is he the type to not help a friend during an emergency? What if you had an emergency and needed him? Could you count on him? Would he be mad about having to help his own friends or you? Maybe some couples counseling would be a good idea if you want to continue this relationship. Having a mediator can help with conversations about things like this.", "NTA you were doing a huge favour to your friend who was in a time of need.

Someone who loves you should know how important friendships are & that in an emergency friends help each other. His reaction screams of a man wanting to fuck up your friendships & isolate you. Run. Run away. I had one of those, he didn\u2019t show this behaviour until we moved in together either. Within 3 years I was a SAHM with very few friends & being much more obviously abused. \nHeed the warning. Leave him.", "Red flag red flag red flag! That man has no empathy, just pure disgusting selfishness. Run, run, RUN!", "NTA. At all!\n\nYou helped your friend during an emergency and the fact that your partner made you feel like you needed to come here and ask if you did the right thing is, imo, a huge red flag. Your bfs behavior was selfish and cruel.", "NTA. How does one feel anger upon hearing their significant other\u2019s friend is in the hospital or going through a family crisis? That\u2019s a crazy-level of ego and self absorption and is absolutely a mark on someone\u2019s character.\n\nKind of makes you wonder what would happen if one of his friends was in the hospital. Or if *you* were taken to the hospital. What would he prioritize?", "NTA You're a great friend btw, and I hope your friend and her husband will be okay.\nSighhh see this is why \"no kids\" people have a bad rep sometimes. (Btw I support people not wanting kids, I'm talking about not being a self-centred dick). Just because you don't want kids doesn't mean you magically will never have to interact or help out someone with a kid. Sure, on paper it's not your responsibility but we are humans, and our obligation to one another is to always help out in emergencies. You BF sucks and is self-centred, him being a no-kids type of person has nothing to do with this. IT WAS AN EMERGENCY. I hope BF reads this and learns some empathy for people.", "NTA but your boyfriend should be your ex. That is so ridiculous that he would be upset about such an emergency. He won't want you helping anyone and he's going to get worse over time not better. Dating shows you what you want and don't want in a partner....and he just showed you his true colors. Walk away, break the lease, money can be earned but respect and support are priceless.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nHonestly, his reaction is enough to get me to reconsider the relationship. It\u2019s an emergency, his lack of empathy, his comparative jump (you chose her over me), and remaining upset afterwards is apathetic, nonsensical, and immature.\n\nA good person, not even partner, just a decent human being, would have understood. Then when you returned a decent human being would have asked if there was any updates on your friend\u2019s husband. \n\nYou missed half of your day off with him to take care of a child whose dad was in a serious (workplace) accident. Your fianc\u00e9 willing chose to not spend the other with you, AND then decided to be a jerk during that time.  \n\nThere are 8 Billion people in the world, and he\u2019s your person. Really?", "NTA - it was an emergency. What kind of self centered narcissist are you with?", "Absolutely! What an immature and selfish prick.", "Just because you\u2019re unhealthy and codependent doesn\u2019t mean other people should succumb to emotional abuse. You\u2019re allowed to have a few hours away from your partner.", "As someone who literally tailors my professional and social life to accommodate my partner\u2019s work schedule so we can see each other\u2014this is deranged mentality.

Given a 3 week old and a 30 year old, you're saying the maturity of these two is likely to be equal given all other variables constant?", "What a ridiculous example 3 weeks to 30 years. We are talking about adults. Some adults never mature mentally, will forever behave like spoilt children and be unreasonable.", "I was significantly more well off and had my goals straight when I was 29. At 36 I had gotten many more bad habits and pretty much lost my drive to succeed in life. I am continually surprised by how much other redditors expect of you just because you\u2019re 5-10 or even 30 years older after the age of 25. At this age you\u2019re an adult, life experiences are vastly different, but mentally you are grown and the year you were born is of zero significance.", "NTA. If I\u2019m being honest I\u2019d be really disappointed having to babysit on a day off but I\u2019d also realize it\u2019s not the end of the world and you didn\u2019t even babysit all day, and I\u2019d also realize it\u2019s an emergency. I don\u2019t like kids all that much but I have too much empathy to tell someone no in a crisis like this. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d forgive myself telling someone no in this situation. \n\nNoon isn\u2019t the end of the day. If that hadn\u2019t happened you probably both would\u2019ve slept in until around that time anyway. \n\nIf my fianc\u00e9 was the one who was asked to babysit I\u2019d stay and help him so we\u2019re still together for that day. Yea we don\u2019t really get to do too much, but I mean for the most part 10 month olds kind of just sleep. Id much rather babysit an infant than a toddler. They can\u2019t walk or be destructive, the most they do is cry. If that. \n\nI get some people really genuinely do not like children but at some point they do have to realize children will always be around in one way or another unless they live away from society. Nobody has to like them or be happy to watch them but having basic empathy is a good thing. It\u2019s a temporary setback from an emergency.", "NTA - this is a legitimate emergency. You didn't even have anything specific planned other than a lazy day. You did your friend a solid when she was obviously stressed out and worried.\n\nHe was still able to have his relaxing day and you were there for a chunk of it. Sometimes life happens and having empathy for other people is such a basic concept.", "Nta you should really rethink your relationship. Like you said your friend has never asked you to watch her child before so this was obviously an emergency, and being able to do that obviously really helped your friend out. The fact that even knowing why you agreed he still had such a bad reaction to the situation is a huge red flag. You should get out while you can especially since the relationship is still newish.", "So OP\u2019s boyfriend extended his pique even after OP returned home from babysitting. What a jerk.

You still had half a day together and he decided to ruin the entire thing because he didn't get to spend an extra 2-3 hours with you?

Rad of you to step put of your comfort zone and give your time and energy doing something you dont like in a time of crisis for a friend. \nI commend that. \n\nYour BF needs to understand the difference between \" I babysat for my friend on my day off\" and \" there was a crisis and I felt called to be a reliable friend. \"\n\nNTA. Your BF though, also NTA. His feelings are hurt. Thats ok. Hes allowed to have his feelings hurt. \nWhat matters now is how you both decide to move forward. Some good communication, establishing boundaries ( \" I will answer the call for a crisis\"... or \"I will shut my phone off on evenings when we share a day off after.\") And maybe discussing requesting a mutual day off every few weeks are great starting points. \n\n( seriously, with the current job market... just establish one required day every month you both refuse to work. If you're valuable, the job will usually concede to this. \" I will need the 24th off every month for the next three months... I need this for establishing a goal to further my communication skills.\")", "It doesn't matter if he or you want kids or not in this situation.  The child part is irrelevant.  If he can't be understanding of an emergency situation, then he probably isn't someone you should waste your days off on.  He's too self-centered, and he's trying to manipulate you so that your world will revolve completely around him.\n\nBut, what if it was your emergency?  Would he whine and complain?  \"But it's the day we're supposed to be off work going to brunch, then the basket weaving at the museum, and we have tickets to see Hamilton!  We're not supposed to be spending it in the hospital with me having to take care of you!!!! You've wasted our whole day!!!

This essentially is how people know we love and care about them. Good for you. Your boyfriend handled this situation horribly. He should  have supported you when you could of used it.", "INFO: Would your BF hold himself to this same standard if one of his friends were in trouble, or does he only have a problem when he's the one being sidelined?\n\nA lazy day off with the person you love is a beautiful thing to be grateful for, but in no way does it justify screwing over a friend that needs your help. NTA", "NTA omg. Firstly, I'd be concerned about his empathy towards others threshold, but also ANY form of communication shut out is unhealthy and unfair. That's a grown ass man throwing a tantrum over you showing empathy and care for your best friend in a time of need. If he is going to shut you out than that's a bigger problem all on its own.", "NTA. Goodness, this was an emergency, sounds like a one off situation, and you didn\u2019t have any plans for the day.

My grandma was a master.", "I put him at 20, maximum, before going back and reading the ages.", "Agree. But it\u2019s unfortunately a strategy used by people of all ages.
