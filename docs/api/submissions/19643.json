We don't have kids and we are not planning on having them. Both of us work 5 days a week, but my days off are always Thursday and Friday, while his days off varies from week to week, so our days off don't always match and it's possible that they don't match for weeks or even a couple of months if we are unlucky enough.\n\nSo, last week my BF's days off were Friday and Saturday, and mine as usual were Thursday and Friday, which meant both of us were free on Friday and we were pretty excited to enjoy our day off together. It was our first day off together since we moved together. We didn't have anything planned, but I was looking forward to laze around with him the entire day.\n\nFriday, at 2AM I received a call from my best friend (F29), she was crying because her husband (he is a truck driver) was in a traffic accident. The accident was in a city 8 hours away, and he was taken to the nearest hospital in a really bad shape. My friend said she and her MIL wanted to leave to the hospital right now so they could be there by mid-morning. My best friend has a ten months old son, and she said she obviously can't get a hold of her usual babysitter at 2AM, so she asked me if I can watch her son for a few hours until she can reach her babysitter.\n\nNow, I'm also not a huge fan of kids, specially babies, I don't know how to deal with them, but this was an emergency and I understand it's probably impossible to get a babysitter at 2AM. My friend had never asked me to baby sit before as she knows I'm not good with kids, but this is an emergency and what are friends for right? So, I said yes and I told her she could drop the baby at my place.\n\nAs soon as I disconnected the call my boyfriend told me he couldn't believe I agreed to babysit and that he didn't want a screaming baby in our house, that it would ruin his day. I agreed he shouldn't be forced to interact with the kid against his will, after all I was the one that agreed to babysit, so I called my friend and told her I will babysit at her place instead.\n\nMy boyfriend got angry at me again, but I left anyway and went to my friend\u2019s place. My friend called the babysitter at 8AM, but she said she wasn't available until noon. So, I ended up babysitting from 2AM until noon. When I returned to my place, my boyfriend was still angry at me. He said I ruined our day off together as I was missing half the day to go babysit a kid that's not even mine. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help my friend.\n\nHe has been ignoring me since Friday, he said it was clear to me my best friend is more important than him as I picked helping her over spending the day with him. I told him it was not matter of who is more important, but he is still upset.\n\nI understand I missed half a day off with him and that we might not get another for a few weeks, but I think it was a special circumstance, my best friend needed my help.

NTA.", "NTA, but you definitely need to replace the BF if he's getting that upset that you're helping a friend in a desperate situation.\n\nYou did the right thing and you still had half a day to spend with him, he ruined that half of the day with his selfishness. If he wants to blame you for ruining the first half, blame him for the second half.", "NTA Your bf is self centred and only cares about his wants and needs. The fact he can\u2019t even show enough empathy in an emergency like this is extremely worrying. These are huge red flags and I hope you get yourself out of this relationship.", "NTA. I'm proud of my husband when he is a good friend, even if it could be a little more convenient because I love that he is a caring, thoughtful person. Do you want to date someone who doesn't have empathy? Your friend's husband was in a terrible accident and it had to be about him and his day off.", "NTA \n\nYou could have been together on Friday if he was mature enough to understand the circumstances of your decision. In that case you would be at your home and will have an helping hand. \n\nI understand a screaming baby could put off some people, but he can just switch rooms, and considering that it was his off day, he shouldn't be angry about seeing a baby.\n\n\nI dont see a problem here being you. Helping someone for a few hrs in their time of trouble is what a friend does, and a partner is responsible for his other half to take care of you. \n\nConsider this a red flag. There could be a past trauma or something affecting his decision making. \n\nI think if you end up marrying him, he can just leave you when you are sick or in trouble as he doesn't like your friends visiting you at the hospital or something. \n\nSorry to say this, but I would advise you to clear things up before moving ahead with your relationship.", "NTA, and your boyfriend has just given you the gift of showing you who he really is.

If you get sick or need help, I'd be worried he'd be mad at you for messing with his plans and you making your share of the rent.  You went above and beyond respecting his need for peace on his day off and went to your friends and he's mad that you chose to help a friend in an emergency instead of hanging out for a few hours.  Based on your post, he is stone cold.  Is this the quality of person you see yourself with long term?", "NTA\n I'm sorry but this is bringing up a ton of red flags. He is acting incredibly immature. You helped a friend in need and had kept your part of your promise to not force the baby on him. You went to HER apartment and took of the baby there. It's not like the parents were going out to party or date, there was an emergency and no one else was able to care for the child in the meantime. \n I implore you to rethink this relationship, because if this how he acts when he doesn't get his way over something as small as not seeing you for a few hours, I'd rather not stick around when he doesn't get his way for bigger things. RUN!", "NTA, there are few things in life that would excuse this behavior toward your partner. This is clearly one of them. Your partner should grow up a bit."]}
