We don't have kids and we are not planning on having them. Both of us work 5 days a week, but my days off are always Thursday and Friday, while his days off varies from week to week, so our days off don't always match and it's possible that they don't match for weeks or even a couple of months if we are unlucky enough.\n\nSo, last week my BF's days off were Friday and Saturday, and mine as usual were Thursday and Friday, which meant both of us were free on Friday and we were pretty excited to enjoy our day off together. It was our first day off together since we moved together. We didn't have anything planned, but I was looking forward to laze around with him the entire day.\n\nFriday, at 2AM I received a call from my best friend (F29), she was crying because her husband (he is a truck driver) was in a traffic accident. The accident was in a city 8 hours away, and he was taken to the nearest hospital in a really bad shape. My friend said she and her MIL wanted to leave to the hospital right now so they could be there by mid-morning. My best friend has a ten months old son, and she said she obviously can't get a hold of her usual babysitter at 2AM, so she asked me if I can watch her son for a few hours until she can reach her babysitter.\n\nNow, I'm also not a huge fan of kids, specially babies, I don't know how to deal with them, but this was an emergency and I understand it's probably impossible to get a babysitter at 2AM. My friend had never asked me to baby sit before as she knows I'm not good with kids, but this is an emergency and what are friends for right? So, I said yes and I told her she could drop the baby at my place.\n\nAs soon as I disconnected the call my boyfriend told me he couldn't believe I agreed to babysit and that he didn't want a screaming baby in our house, that it would ruin his day. I agreed he shouldn't be forced to interact with the kid against his will, after all I was the one that agreed to babysit, so I called my friend and told her I will babysit at her place instead.\n\nMy boyfriend got angry at me again, but I left anyway and went to my friend\u2019s place. My friend called the babysitter at 8AM, but she said she wasn't available until noon. So, I ended up babysitting from 2AM until noon. When I returned to my place, my boyfriend was still angry at me. He said I ruined our day off together as I was missing half the day to go babysit a kid that's not even mine. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help my friend.\n\nHe has been ignoring me since Friday, he said it was clear to me my best friend is more important than him as I picked helping her over spending the day with him. I told him it was not matter of who is more important, but he is still upset.\n\nI understand I missed half a day off with him and that we might not get another for a few weeks, but I think it was a special circumstance, my best friend needed my help.

If you get sick or need help, I'd be worried he'd be mad at you for messing with his plans and you making your share of the rent.  You went above and beyond respecting his need for peace on his day off and went to your friends and he's mad that you chose to help a friend in an emergency instead of hanging out for a few hours.  Based on your post, he is stone cold.  Is this the quality of person you see yourself with long term?", "NTA\n I'm sorry but this is bringing up a ton of red flags. He is acting incredibly immature. You helped a friend in need and had kept your part of your promise to not force the baby on him. You went to HER apartment and took of the baby there. It's not like the parents were going out to party or date, there was an emergency and no one else was able to care for the child in the meantime. \n I implore you to rethink this relationship, because if this how he acts when he doesn't get his way over something as small as not seeing you for a few hours, I'd rather not stick around when he doesn't get his way for bigger things. RUN!", "NTA, there are few things in life that would excuse this behavior toward your partner. This is clearly one of them. Your partner should grow up a bit.", "Does BF have any real friends? How does he not understand that we help people we care about? Sounds like a jerk.", "Absolutely NTA, also like a lot of other commenters mentioned, this scenario is clearly showing some red flags.\n\nThe blatant lack of compassion and understanding from your SO is kinda appalling, and clearly, he is incredibly selfish to stick to hus argument.\n\nObviously I don't know if he's shown any manipulative or abusive behaviours in the past, but if I were in your shoes, I'd use this situation as an opportunity to get out before his need for control puts you in danger.", "NTA. You two could have hung out after noon, and the rest of the day. Were there already plans for the two of you in place, that were time-sensitive and were missed (like seeing a movie at a certain time, brunch/lunch plans with friends, etc)? \n\nSeems pretty selfish and immature to hold a grudge against you for helping a friend. You even accommodated him by not watching the baby at your place for his sake. Is he the type to not help a friend during an emergency? What if you had an emergency and needed him? Could you count on him? Would he be mad about having to help his own friends or you? Maybe some couples counseling would be a good idea if you want to continue this relationship. Having a mediator can help with conversations about things like this.", "NTA you were doing a huge favour to your friend who was in a time of need.

You compromised on your having to deal with kids one time in an emergency to help your best friend because her husband was hospitalized in a traffic accident.\n\nThat your thirty-six year old BF has difficulty comprehending how this works speaks more to his lack of maturity than anything else, and perhaps you might be better off not having to deal with the emotional burden of someone who seems to lack basic empathy.", "NTA.

Significantly older partners think they can tell you what\u2019s correct, and use experience to fashion a relationship that\u2019s favorable to them.

It\u2019s not immature to want alone time with your partner. Doing a good deed at the expense of your family is wrong. It\u2019s no longer a good deed it\u2019s virtue signaling.
