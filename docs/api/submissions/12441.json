It\u2019s been about a month since my original post & I thought I\u2019d provide an update. Before I get into it I just wanted to thank you all for reading my original post and offering your opinion on the matter, whether it was making me TA or not. However to those who told me to pay the $1000 lease breaking fee or buy a house, I take PayPal, CashApp, & Venmo!\n\nSo to cut right to it, I ended up filing another noise complaint against the neighbors across the hall after a particularly bad tantrum that involved not only screaming & crying, but banging against their front door as well. It lasted from 6:30pm to roughly 10pm, & I managed to get a small snippet on video to show the office staff.\n\nThe next day I went to the leasing office and showed the manager the video from the night prior. Needless to say she was appalled and apologized profusely, stating she didn't realize they were being THAT loud on a daily basis. She had me fill out another written complaint and said that they would be sending out a final warning, meaning that if they didn't get their act together in a week they would be served a 30 day eviction notice.\n\nWhile I filled out another written complaint, she explained to me that the family was Indian and confirmed that neither the husband or wife spoke English, though the wife could understand a bit. She also said that every time they came to the office the little girl would run around screaming and jumping on furniture while the mom ignored her behavior. Even when they went to sign the lease she said they brought at least 8 other people and their kids with them and these kids would also run around screaming and jumping on the furniture. I know it was suggested she could be on the spectrum or have a disability, but since other kids were behaving like this I think it\u2019s more learned behavior.\n\nAfter the warning was sent out it was quiet. \\*Too\\* quiet. I noticed their carport was empty as well as their other car. And it wasn't until the other day when I was coming up the stairs after doing laundry that I saw an older gentleman leaving the apartment. I smiled and gave a polite nod and managed to see that their apartment was completely empty. No furniture, no nothing. It seems like they abandoned the place as eviction (from what the office staff told me) wouldn't be that quick.\n\nSo that\u2019s my update! It looks like instead of taking the 7 day warning they just abandoned their lease instead. They always had visitors so I think they have a very supportive community around them and probably moved in with friends. While the situation overall sucks, I\u2019m glad that it didn\u2019t come to eviction.\n\nThanks again to all of you, and I hope your day is full of awesome!\n\nTL;DR - put in another complaint after another 4 hour tantrum, neighbors chose to abandon their lease instead of quiet down after a final warning", "created_utc": 1678977926, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sw5l8/update_wibta_if_i_filed_another_noise_complaint/", "score": 157, "replies": ["I'm glad it was resolved.", "I\u2019m suffering from an early morning and late night banshee screamer as well. I managed to get dressed and go out to check which floor/flat it was. \n\nThis motherfucker sounded like it was directly above me, but it\u2019s up and one over. I hear stomping, whinging, full on blood curdling screaming tantrums coming out my walls, it\u2019s like living in an 80s slasher movie.\n\nI don\u2019t think that kid is normal, but I\u2019m not really sure what normal is for little kids. I\u2019m just fairly sure it\u2019s not *that*.\n\nI\u2019m glad that\u2019s a thing you could complain about where you live. I\u2019m not sure it is in the UK, but now that I have the right flat I wrote them a note suggesting they try to screech their kid at the other end of the flat away from everyone\u2019s bedrooms. \n\nThere are studio flats with no bedroom doors inside, literally everyone on that floor must be listening to it non stop. It was so loud in that hall.", "Sounds like they aren't from your county (assuming USA). They might not realize abandoning apartments doesn't do you any favors lol they'll have a hell of a time finding a new place", "NTA. Enjoy the quiet.", "Tbh I\u2019m kind of guessing given the scenario described by the apartment manager where they came in with multiple people, that they evicted themselves before management could check them out because they were worried they would find something lease breaking. Such as having more people living in the apartment than was allowed in the unit per their lease.", "Hopefully next person is quite. Glad they left.", "Huh, this surprises me because Indian children are typically much better behaved than American and British children, based on my experiences living in all 3 countries. It\u2019s not even a close contest by a long shot. That said, I would go crazy having neighbors like that. I hope their poor daughter gets the help she needs.", "At least you know the kid is sleeping in a car or The street ! That way they won\u2019t ever bother you again", "[deleted]", "U.K. here as well; technically Wales in case it makes a difference.\n\nCouncils here won\u2019t take any action regarding noisy children. However, you might have a stronger case to plead if you\u2019re in flats and can persuade your neighbours to join with in any correspondence you have with the council. It\u2019s not just you being affected, which might help.", "Depends on the circumstances. I was briefly involved with managing some rental property, and a negotiated lease break was frequently faster and cheaper for both parties than trying to pursue an eviction, so a lot of problematic tenants left by that route. It would look similar to a neighbor.", "It's very possible the complex offered to let them out of their lease without fees when they have the final warning, and they took the offer. Many places will do that because if you can get someone to leave, existing the fees is usually far less than the costs of taking them to court for an eviction, plus there's risk that someone angry about being evicted will damage the property.", "This is an irrational and sh\\*tty guilt trip. You know, OP did not force them to move, even the leasing office did not do that too. They chose to abandon the place themselves, and that was their choice. Furthermore, in the beginning, the fault lies at their feet, they only had themselves to blame for that.\n\nIf they planned to abandon the place and NOT had another accommodation for their kids, then they are to blame for that, and not OP. Bad parents are bad parents, and it is not because of their neighbors. Did your parents treat you like that?\n\nSince you run your mouth so smoothly, and quick to guilt trip, so why don't you help them then? Find them a place to live? Or let them live with you so the kids can scream and run around your house, huh? If you cannot put your action where your mouth is, I suggest you kindly keep silent, because at least you would help people not hearing your sh\\*tty hypocrite speech.", "They left voluntarily, they didn\u2019t get evicted.  The leasing office confirmed that when I followed up, plus eviction is a process.  I highly doubt they\u2019re on the street or in a car if they left voluntarily", "It's not op's responsibility. They were the ones who couldn't parent their child. Was op (and the rest of the tenants that filed complaints) supposed to listen to screaming and yelling all day long??", "The post makes it clear that the family has supportive family or friends, so claiming she's making them homeless is ridiculous.  They may have to crash with another family for a short while until they find another apartment, but that's it.  That's a very reasonable natural consequence for making a dozen other people's homes barely livable due to their own unwillingness to parent their child.", "They wouldn't have just left if they didn't have somewhere to go. They would've stayed until they were evicted.", "You can give them your adress to move in next to you. They could've tried parenting their child", "Of course not never said it was", "[deleted]", "Why would I want them next to me? How is me saying a fact such a issue lol", "No,you just blamed OP for them living in a car. As if it's her fault for them being terrible parents", "They probably went to live with the 8 other people and their screaming children.", "You didn't said a fact. You wrote a fantasy about them living on the streets now and that op should be happy. \n\n>Why would I want them next to me?\n\nSo that you could see how op felt since you blamed her for them \"living in a car or being homeless\". - your words before deleting your comment"]}
