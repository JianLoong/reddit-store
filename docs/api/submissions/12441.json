It\u2019s been about a month since my original post & I thought I\u2019d provide an update. Before I get into it I just wanted to thank you all for reading my original post and offering your opinion on the matter, whether it was making me TA or not. However to those who told me to pay the $1000 lease breaking fee or buy a house, I take PayPal, CashApp, & Venmo!\n\nSo to cut right to it, I ended up filing another noise complaint against the neighbors across the hall after a particularly bad tantrum that involved not only screaming & crying, but banging against their front door as well. It lasted from 6:30pm to roughly 10pm, & I managed to get a small snippet on video to show the office staff.\n\nThe next day I went to the leasing office and showed the manager the video from the night prior. Needless to say she was appalled and apologized profusely, stating she didn't realize they were being THAT loud on a daily basis. She had me fill out another written complaint and said that they would be sending out a final warning, meaning that if they didn't get their act together in a week they would be served a 30 day eviction notice.\n\nWhile I filled out another written complaint, she explained to me that the family was Indian and confirmed that neither the husband or wife spoke English, though the wife could understand a bit. She also said that every time they came to the office the little girl would run around screaming and jumping on furniture while the mom ignored her behavior. Even when they went to sign the lease she said they brought at least 8 other people and their kids with them and these kids would also run around screaming and jumping on the furniture. I know it was suggested she could be on the spectrum or have a disability, but since other kids were behaving like this I think it\u2019s more learned behavior.\n\nAfter the warning was sent out it was quiet. \\*Too\\* quiet. I noticed their carport was empty as well as their other car. And it wasn't until the other day when I was coming up the stairs after doing laundry that I saw an older gentleman leaving the apartment. I smiled and gave a polite nod and managed to see that their apartment was completely empty. No furniture, no nothing. It seems like they abandoned the place as eviction (from what the office staff told me) wouldn't be that quick.\n\nSo that\u2019s my update! It looks like instead of taking the 7 day warning they just abandoned their lease instead. They always had visitors so I think they have a very supportive community around them and probably moved in with friends. While the situation overall sucks, I\u2019m glad that it didn\u2019t come to eviction.\n\nThanks again to all of you, and I hope your day is full of awesome!\n\nTL;DR - put in another complaint after another 4 hour tantrum, neighbors chose to abandon their lease instead of quiet down after a final warning", "created_utc": 1678977926, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sw5l8/update_wibta_if_i_filed_another_noise_complaint/", "score": 2182, "replies": ["I'm glad it was resolved.", "I\u2019m suffering from an early morning and late night banshee screamer as well.

They don't reign in their kids at all, they let them be themselves. I don't think it occurs to most Indian parents that their kids' rambunctious behavior is annoying to other people, it's just kids being kids.  They must be doing something right because 99.9% of the Indian adults I dealt with at that job were exceedingly polite and gracious.", "Westerners often have the attitude that children should be seen and not heard.

I found out their background from the leasing manager and added it to this post to see if maybe there was a cultural disconnect between them and what we typically deal with in the U.S.  No ill intent on my part, but maybe don't be so quick to judge, or just be less hypocritical about it when you do try and call someone out.", ">WTF does being Indian have to do with having an unruly child? \n\n\n\nEverything.
