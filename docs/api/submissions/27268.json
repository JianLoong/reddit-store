I told her I paid a lot for the dress and didn't understand the issue. She texted back huge messages about I needed to get over myself and had no idea how stressful it is to plan a wedding, that she doesn't even know if she can pay for the venue. She had asked to borrow $1000 a week before that for the wedding and we couldn't help as we are saving for our own wedding and didnt feel comfortable we would be paid back as has happened in the past. She ended the convo there but later texted my fiance letting him know my son from a previous relationship and his \"girlfriend\" meaning me are no longer invited to the wedding. My fiance is refusing to go without us and told her we are his family. She retracted the whole statement a day later and said everyone could come but I don't go where I am not wanted.

I guess I wonder why you sent her pictures of what you were wearing in the first place since you were not in the wedding party.", "NTA - she is being very rude and entitled. She has made you feel really unwelcome and only invited you back because your partner stuck up for you (good on him). Don't go and do something much more enjoyable", "NTA.  And is she reviewing the attire of everyone she invited?  She sounds like she was insecure that you might look good, therefore overshadow her - the bride - the star of the show and reigning queen for the day.", "NTA- the problem clearly is your fianc\u00e9's sister. Now the problem is to know if you would prefer to go even though she' s not very welcoming towards you (which doesn't necessarily mean that everyone is not welcoming) or if you don't want to experiment the awkwardness of the wedding and just stay home. The choices that you ll make will not be bad or good, it just depends on how you feel.", "NTA.\n\nThis is convoluted.\n\nBut if you decide to go, just wear the dress you got.", "NTA. It's all about money.  Guarantee if you had given the $1,000,\n1. You would have never gotten it back\n2. The blue dress would've been perfect,  and\n3. No issues with your invite", "NTA. I think it's very kind of you to show you your dress beforehand. As you are not in the wedding party, you were not obligated to do that.", "Nah babes, you're NTA. She kinda sounds like a jealous nightmare (sorry). Save the money if you haven't spent it already and go enjoy a nice date in your pretty blue dress!", "NTA, that is some absolutely abusive behavior. It sounds like she decided she didn\u2019t like your dress because you wouldn\u2019t loan her 1k. \n\nIf she\u2019s going to treat you like that, absolutely don\u2019t go. Actions have consequences and nobody should be treating you that way.", "NTA, at all... though I would consider attending in the original dress and decide to just have the best time possible - be above it. What's she gonna do?  Be mad you're having a good time in a perfectly appropriate dress?  It she wants to let that ruin her day, she's just *looking* for a reason to be pissed.", "NTA\n\nSIL sounds like a real gem.", "NTA.", "NTA. You had me at \"out of state wedding.\" The whole dress debacle and disinvite didn't help either.", "ESH It's obvious neither of you likes the other regardless of this wedding.\n\nQuestion:  If you were only a guest and not part of the wedding party, why would you send her pictures of dresses?\n\nAnd I do not believe for a minute that she said she wanted you to get a dress that cost just 10 bucks.  In no universe, do I believe that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I'm not clear why you needed an okay on a dress when you were not in the wedding party, but whatever. Your soon-to-be SIL sounds like she's off the deep end at this point.

You aren't in the wedding party, and probably won't be in many photos.", "NTA.

Fair enough if you are wearing a bridal gown other than that? Who cares?", "I thought asking her opinion would help build a bond.

We don't have a lot in common to talk about", "That was a nice gesture on paper, but I think it revealed something unpleasant about her. \n\nI mean, she wanted you to ditch the lovely dress you bought for a $10 she would pick for you?
