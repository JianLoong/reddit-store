It is likely she has already decided on a different punishment.", "I Will honestly never understand why brides/grooms think it's their right to dictate what people fucking wear it's absolutely ridiculous, as long as your not wearing a bloody wedding dress or a grooms suit what does it actually matter what people wear. A bloody power trip these people are on. Also, she is obviously only being awkward because you never put your hand in your pocket and handed over money to her. Tell her to ram her wedding.

She is punishing you over the $1000.  You tried to connect with her and now you know - she is an unpleasant person and you can keep her at arm's length and quit trying to bond.  You and fiance just need to decide as a team.  Do you think you can have a nice time with the rest of the family, or will the whole trip be a nightmare?

If it\u2019s this bad over text/phone, it will be a thousand times worse in person.  Your fianc\u00e9 is not a child - he made this decision on his own.

(Which was very nice and not necessary for you to even do).  But a wedding is stressful and she was probably just having a freak out which she did retract.  You are holding a grudge. Obviously she realizes she screwed up and you should forgive her, attend and have a nice time.  When you're the bride you are probably going to have a melt down of yourself a few times where someone has to talk you down.  Attend, be polite and gracious.  She's going to be family.

Why were you even showing it to her?\n\nYou could easily take the tact that, yes, weddings are stressful, why should I be bothering the bride with something that is so unrelated to anything in her purview?\n\nShe does sound like a control freak. You solve that by not giving her something to control.", "Goodwill? She wants you in a dress from a thrift shop?\n\nNot to denigrate thrift shops--but that's not what you wear to a wedding.\n\nThis is because you wouldn't give her money. It's revenge.

Shit he can even say to people who ask that you were uninvited and go into no further detail, that way when it comes to your wedding you will have a lot less people complaining about how you didn't show up to the sister's wedding, etc. Control the narrative before it gets out of control while he's not there.\n\nBut you, absolutely NTA to not go. She called to randomly complain about a dress she had already approved and thought you could replace it for $10. Then uninvited you, then backtracked that but you know she doesn't mean it.", "NTA - you are not intruding on anyone else's plans.  You are not obligated to go and if your fiance doesn't want to then so be it.  The bride's loss!", "NGL - When I was a bride, folks would ask me what to wear to the wedding and I was all \"I dunno, I have my dress picked out though!\" I had no bandwidth to manage anyone else's decisions beyond mine for the wedding.\n\nBut, then the two of you have a nice moment, she picks a dress, you commit and pay for said dress, and now months later she's all, no, wait, you cannot wear it now that you cannot return it? And more drama as well.\n\nI am with you. I wouldn't really want to go either. And it sounds like you're a package deal, so three will no longer be attending.\n\nI would send a card with a modest check though.", "NTA - I'm guessing she was being petty about not being able to borrow the money.

I wouldn't go either, nor would I blame your fianc\u00e9 for not going.\n\nSidenote though - why are weddings such drama for people? I've had my fair share of wedding drama too, and I just don't get it. Everyday on this sub (and others), I see so many posts about wedding drama that is ridiculously petty and small. MIL refused to NOT wear white. Sister got mad because kid couldn't smash wedding cake. Bride kicked her best friend out of bridal party because she refused to shave her head. Like honestly...wtf is wrong with people? Hell, my first wedding, my MOH was completely absent for most events. She owned a restaurant, and my future (now ex) SIL asked if we could have a lingerie shower there for me. My MOH said yes, but she refused to pitch in or offer any discounts for food...made my ex-SIL pay full price for having my lingerie shower there, and didn't even buy me a gift. After several more months of hurt feelings, I decided that my brother's wife (now ex too, unfortunately) deserved a place of honor since she had helped and been present so much...she truly was like a sister to me, and I was devastated when she and my brother split, but anyway, I asked if she could be promoted to MOH *with* my other MOH. I didn't demote the first one, just wanted her to stand in the place of honor with her. First MOH got upset about it, and my MOTHER of all people, encouraged her to ghost my wedding day all together. Mom shows up without MOH, who was supposed to ride with her, and said dismissively, \"Oh she's not coming. I told her if she was upset, it was probably best she didn't come anyway.\" ON MY WEDDING DAY. The way my mom is though, I've always had suspicions that she somewhat stirred that pot.", "NTA.  Her making that comment about your son not being invited was really uncalled for.  At that point she was just being petty and rude.

Don\u2019t invite her to your wedding", "That part jumped out at me too. The timing there seemed less than coincidental.\n\nDepending on how involved her own groom is in the wedding planning, SIL may also be jealous that her brother (OOs fianc\u00e9) is actively involved with the saving and planning for his and OPs own wedding. Especially if OP and her fianc\u00e9 are taking it slow and planning something that will fit inside the budget they're saving for.

Doesn't matter if it is a person upset about having their feelings (rightfully) hurt over a dress or a roommate that ate the last twinkie without permission.  And I am beginning to wonder, is being right so much more important than being civil these days?  I read this post and I see a family in turmoil for years to come over a ridiculous thing a bride said and did.  Every holiday, every BBQ, every birth of a new child will have bitterness and awkwardness over someone's hurt feelings.  These two women are going to be tied together by marriage, hopefully for life and she's not going to attend the wedding because she doesn't feel welcome and embraced any longer?  And now there is a family in turmoil for years to come over something that could be solved by OP planting a smile on her face, eating some crappy chicken dinner and wishing the bride and groom well.  I guess as long as she's \"right\", that's whats most important. My generation may suck (GenX) but you know what most of us do well?  Forget about the little crap.", "I think you're right on not wearing the (now) disapproved dress, if only for appearances sake. Only problem is who has money to just casually buy more expensive clothing when saving for a wedding? OP, do you have something old in your wardrobe that's suitable, even if not as nice?", "Babe, why would you think that would \"build a bond\"? It can only cause problems, and it did. At best, it's another decisions (of dozens) that the bride needs to make.\n\nAnd at worst for you, you've now given her the power to control what you wear. That's a yikes for you. Instead, I suggest offering to take someone you'd like to built a relationship with out for a drink or venting session.", "She's definitely the AH, but that doesn't sound like a bond, that sounds like just inserting yourself.
