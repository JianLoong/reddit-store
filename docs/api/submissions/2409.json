She's 63. In my country, she's not even at the standard age to start receiving a government pension. \n\nNTA", "NTA Your brother is free to do whatever he wants but you are not obligated to support any adult who refuses to work, especially one who is expecting other people to pay for her mistakes.", "NTA. 63 is not too old to work and support oneself.", "NTA. 63 isn\u2019t elderly. Your brother and you should give her a timeline to start pulling back on the support. It\u2019ll do all 3 of you good. She has at least 10 good years ahead of her, unless she spends it laying around doing nothing.", "NTA\n\nHowever your brother is the main \"guilty\" party here, even if his intentions are so nice and honorable.\n\nHe has enabled your mother's behaving and from his point of view he is happy to provide for her, as he was happy to provide for you and your studies. It's the way he is.\n\nYou don't have to provide for her, especially since now you are unable to, financially. If your brother wants to do it, let him, and don't feel guilty about it. He's a grown-up and can make his own decisions.", "NTA. And I am really sorry you are in this situation. Boundries are necessary at somepoint and asking her to do at least *something* to help with the finances is totally justified. Of course we all wish that at 63 we could just retire and live the good life...but many many people have to work up until 70. That is just the reality. \n\nAnd what you and your brother need to be really careful...and do some balancing of priorities, is that you don't sacrifice so much right now that you don't properly save for retirement yourself and put your kids in the exact same situation.", "NTA she is only 63 my aunt started her online business at 65, your brother is too kind hearted but I bet if he missed a payment your mom would complain. It doesn't look like the situation will change so I suggest you stop payments and look after yourself.", "NTA\nI work with a 71 year old. He sits at the front desk of the hotel and greets people as they walk in. 3 days a week.  She can do something.", "NTA She is still plenty young enough to be working. You are not responsible for her debts, you need to be working for your future not paying off her past. I recommend that you tell your brother to look at his finances and consider cutting her off before he ruins his future.", "NAH. It sucks that your mom would have to go back to work at 63 years old! So I can understand your brother wanting to carry her. but I also understand your plight as well, and if money is tight, everyone needs to do their share, including your mom (if she's capable).", "NTA.  63 is not elderly.  That's not even retirement age in the US.   \n Unless she has serious health issues, she could still work part time.  Even with some health issues, there are jobs you can still do.  I'd do some research into it and even check into senior services to see what options there are, including anything online she may be able to handle with light training.  It'd been nice to get paid but even volunteer work might be good and could even lead to a paying job.", "NTA. \n\nMy mother retired at 62 from one job and then worked others for another 15 years!  My in-laws retired early but also took additional jobs in retirement into their 70s.  I'm nearly 60 but probably won't retire for 10 years and I certainly won't be relying on my children.\n\nHaving children is not a retirement plan.  You aren't responsible for what your brother decides, but you can certainly tell your mother that you won't be supporting her any more.", "NTA.  If your brother wants to set himself on fire to keep your mom warm, that's his business, but you don't need to do the same thing.\n\nStart worrying about yourself, or YOU will be penniless in 25-30 years because you've been throwing all your money at her.", "NTA why not intend for her to work full time, she needs to stop relying on others to pay her way and be a grown up now.", "Jesus, 63 IS NOT OLD!! \nBoth you and your brother should give her an ultimatum to get her act together and if she doesn\u2019t step up - drop her like a hot potato. She is mooching of you, consider you her retirement plan and won\u2019t lift a finger to help you in any way.

If Mom is not disabled, she can absolutely find employment,  preferably a full time job with benefits.", "63 is not elderly! You could have another 30 years of this.", "NTA. But, you made your point, now drop it. Refuse to give money to her or your brother. They both made their beds, now they can lie in it. Don't feel guilty. They are adults and can make their own choices and live by the results. Instead, focus on your future and start saving.

Since you benefited from your brothers help, I could understand help, to a degree, but not to the point of enablement.  I think she's been enabled too much already.

What's her plan then?", "63?! thats not elderly at all!! depending on her physical health she can work a full time job just fine! my grandma is 67 and she\u2019s fit like shes 20! she can work and support herself still, she just seems like she wants her kids to do it for her. best of luck <3 NTA", "NTA.  If that is the way your brother feels, he can 100% support her for the rest of her life.  Write it off as covered.

She thought I missed my \u201cpayments\u201d to her living fee when her bank statement is less. For context my father\u2019s side of the family has been sending her money occasionally. So she hounded me about it even when I was clear to her I had wired the money. She questioned me and was sure I had forgotten when I never missed sending money to her for the past 5 years. \n\nTurned out the money from father\u2019s family wasnt wired correctly. I told her I was frankly insulted and felt our relationship is too transactional. The only time she messaged me that long is because of this issue.", "This. My MIL (who I consider more of a mother than my own) is the same age and still working. We all work. I would give anything to have her retire and be home with her grandkids. I hope by next year. She\u2019s able bodied but she\u2019s been full time employed since she was 14! She deserves a break. And OP deserves a mom more like that.", "Wow so sorry, it just goes to show all she is thinking abt is money. Go no contact too.", "Lol 63 isn\u2019t even retirement age in the states.

She is just used to live on your and your brother's money and doesn't see why she should make an effort to earn it when she gets it free. \n\nIt is time to stop feeding that bottomless maw and to think about yourself. You lost your job. You need to stop wasting away your money when you will need every cent until you find a new one. At nearly 30 you need to start building your own monetary cushion. There's a good possibility that your mother will leave you with more hidden debts to pay. What will you do if you have given her all the money that could have been your savings? \n\nIf you find it difficult to cut off the feeding tube, use the fact that you lost your job to cut down seriously on the amount you are giving her and do not bring the amount back up once you have a job. \n\nBy the way, I'm 59, still working and expected to work until my 66th birthday to have my full retirement. I have friends your mother's age who never stopped working. I'll bet that she is the one bringing up her 'old age' to guilt you into paying. \n\nNTA", "NTA - holy mackerel, I\u2019m in my 70\u2019s and don\u2019t consider myself elderly.  If your brother wants to continue supporting him, that\u2019s on him. I sure as heck would not help an able bodied woman.  If you got severance, do not give any to her.", "NTA, but if your brother is fine with paying her way let him. Doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept that burden yourself.", "NTA!  And 63 is not even close to elderly.  Since your brother feels this way, he can pay it all.", "NTA  Not your problem.  Either your mother's refusal to support herself nor your brother's beggaring his family to take care of a competent adult.  Say to yourself, I need to focus on myself and make sure that I can take care of myself now and in the future.  I need a plan on how to buy my own home, save for my retirement, etc..  Don't leave your future family in the same place you find yourself.  Cut the cord.", "Sounds like your mother only wants you when she needs something from you. That's not a fun place to be in at all.\n\nBut perhaps you need to stop your support directly to her. Don't push her to work, that's not going to be effective and will only annoy your brother, who has been good to you. \n\nTalk to your brother. Tell him that you apparently have had very different mothers. While he might feel obligation to her, you do not. You feel obligation to him. Repay his gift of an education directly to him. If he chooses to use the repayment to fund your mother, that's completely his choice. But you won't be any longer. You're eternally grateful to him for taking care of you when your parents couldn't, but you can't allow your mother to treat you like this any longer.\n\nNTA", "Oh dear, I just discovered I'm elderly.\n\nI'm 64 and currently working on a few ideas to earn money. It's enjoyable and challenging. And I'm chronically ill, unlike your mother.\n\nI also am very independent, a self-starter  and full of initiative.\n\nYour mother sounds more passive and dependent.\n\nI guess your mother will get social security/super / old age pension at some point. That should take some if the pressure off you and your brother.\n\nNTA to wantvher to help herself. But from what you say I don't think she's ever going to try to earn money herself.", "NTA but I strongly urge you to stop financially contributing to her debts/costs.  If your brother thinks she shouldn't have to work, then let him shoulder that burden completely on his own.", "NTA\n\n63 y/o isn't old.  She can and should certainly get at least a part-time job.", "Damn. She's DJ Nana."]}
