We have a very stable and good relationship and we are the type of couple that stop doing something if it makes the other one upset, and here is where my story starts. \n\nI\u2019ll call them Sarah and Paul. Sarah and Paul have been friends since middle school and have spent every moment together including new years, birthdays etc. When he went to uni and met me, they stopped hanging out as much.  Sarah studies in a state right next to hours but they barely have time to see each other because she\u2019s busy with school. \n\nThey arranged for new years to meet up, I asked my boyfriend who else was coming and he said it was just them. I got visibly upset and immediately told him i didn\u2019t feel comfortable with him hanging out with a woman alone since he expects the same from me. I have no problem if he hangs out with her or any other woman in a group of people, he\u2019s allowed to have friends but I have my boundaries. \n\nHe got quite upset but said he respects my decision and I thought that was it. I got a dm and it was Sarah. She wrote me a long paragraph explaining how she expected me to let them hang out because she has no romantic interest towards him and they\u2019ve been friends since they were kids. I kindly replied to her and said she was welcome to hang out with her, him and their other friends or with us two but that I wouldn\u2019t allow them to be alone. I\u2019m just not comfortable with it.\n\nShe just liked the message and I thought that was that. Until after new years, yesterday, I was speaking to a mutual friend of mine that knows Sarah and her best friend who we will call Jessica. My mutual friend told me that she\u2019s in a group chat with Sarah, Jessica and a few other girls. \n\nSarah and Jessica have been talking talking shit about me. Criticising my appearance, talking about my weight, sending pictures of me and my family back and forth in the group chat. Even going so far as to bullying my dog who had passed away a few months ago.\n\nI was visibly upset and immediately texted Sarah and showed her the pictures I had took of my friends phone screen with the messages of their hurtful words visible. She tried to defend it by saying that she was upset because I had taken away her best friend from her and that she said all those things with her friend during the spur of the moment. I started criticising her appearance, her pictures, etc. every little thing she did to me, I did to her. She immediately blocked me after this and called my boyfriend. \n\nHe got mad at me and told me that instead of doing the same thing to her that I should have talked to him about it and that disrespecting her wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. He went on and on about how she does things in the spur of the moment and how I should\u2019ve been the bigger person and ignored it, even calling our mutual friend a snitch. My friend is on my side, telling me I was just giving her the same treatment she gave me for simply existing.

Your response was a bit immature, which is why I gave the E S H rating. That being said...is he worth it? \n\nHere you are at your first true test of the relationship and from my point of view, he failed. Yes, you acted badly and should have just spoken to him about it. But, he also didn't chastise her for her behavior and defended HER. \n\nI would be walking away from this guy who clearly doesn't have your back.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have shit talked you, the friend shouldn\u2019t have started drama, your boyfriend should be equally upset with both of you, but also\u2026you\u2019re with this guy a few months and you\u2019re dictating who he can and can\u2019t hang out with.

You\u2019re not the AH to set boundaries that he set for you too. \n \nSarah just doesn\u2019t sound like a good friend to be honest. Sarah attacking your appearance, weight, even your dog that passed away is extremely petty and unacceptable. It\u2019s never right to attack someone personally, no excuses. She has no respect for you, means she has no respect for him either. I know because I have a 10 years best friend from the opposite gender, and we\u2019re both incredibly understanding and respectful of boundaries when either of us is in a relationship. \n \nYTA because could you have dealt with it better? Yes. You should\u2019ve talked to your boyfriend about it, communicate first as he is the mutual connection here. He should be aware of this happening and he should be the one to mediate. Going behind his back and attack his friend isn\u2019t the most appropriate. \n \nAdvice? Talk to your boyfriend, communicate with him, tell him about how you feel. Apologise for going behind his back but also let him know how hurt you are to be attacked like this. Figure out a solution together and set the boundaries straight.", "ESH.

Any relationship where you won't let a partner be alone with a friend of a gender they are typically attracted to are doomed. It shows really low self respect.\n\nAlso, girlfriends don't get to trump best friends automatically. Its unhealthy to give up long term friends for a romantic relationship. Especially one of A FEW MONTHS. \n\nObviously the friend and the bf are also immature here.", "ESH. \nI want to start this off by saying your boundaries are not the problem here.

I understand she\u2019s upset about not hanging out with your BF alone but to me that\u2019s sketchy asf. We all know if she was in your situation she would have the same boundaries. I honestly wouldn\u2019t trust what she says about not having feelings for your bf. \n\nYou\u2019re the AH for attacking her back and stooping to her level of pettiness and not going to your boyfriend when you found out about it. \n\nHe\u2019s the AH for defending her behavior. While you were wrong by attacking her back he should absolutely be putting her in her place and telling he that if she\u2019s gonna be like that towards you then he can\u2019t be friends with her because she doesn\u2019t respect the person he\u2019s in a relationship with. \n\nHonestly girl, this relationship is probably not going to last, especially if he\u2019s defending her actions and not calling her out for her shitty behavior.

Insecurity.\n\nYou\u2019re insecure about your BF being around other women. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been cheated on in the past or by him or just don\u2019t feel confident in yourself but to keep your BF away from hanging out with female friends is a little controlling. This goes for him too. You both have major insecurity In your relationship together.\n\nWhy? If you both love and trust each other it shouldn\u2019t matter if you both hang out alone with the opposite sex. If your committed to one another than no one else matters.\n\nThis is going to continue down into your relationship and affect other friendships in the future if you both don\u2019t trust each other more. \n\nThis is just as much his fault as yours. If it was his rule first to not allow the both of you to hang out with the op sex alone than he is also responsible for this interaction.

However if this friendship is worth fixing at this point it\u2019s also his job to fix this situation and explain to his friend that you both have this agreement not to hang out with friends of the op sex alone so that she can apologize to you for the awful things she said about you. So than you can apologize to her for reacting in a similar fashion.\n\nBut again when it comes to your response and handing of the situation. YTA.", "I am conflicted about this one. A bit about me, I (M26) have a best friend who is a girl my age, she said multiple times she sees me as a brother (and she has 2 already so it's not like she doesn't know what she's talking about) we have been there for each other year by year, Christmas gifts, birthdays, Halloween parties, NYEs... Sometimes we hang out together, just the 2 of us, lunches, dinners, you would probably assume we are a couple if you saw us. But we aren't, none of us has a crush on the other one, and if my girlfriend had a problem with the 2 of us being alone, I would NOT react well. Which is justified because I am very upfront about it when I meet someone new, I say something on the lines of \"look, there is this girl in my life, we are best friends since we were 7, sometimes we have lunch or dinner together just the 2 of us, if you have a problem with that, if it makes you uncomfortable, if you are jealous etc. then it's best we don't go on a second date\". My friend also explains this to her boyfriends (her current boyfriend and the ones she had in the past), to my knowledge she never had an issue.\n\nNow, back to you. If your boyfriend gave you a speech like I do, when you started dating, explaining the kind of friendship he has with this girl, then in that case YWBTA.
