I also got a new job not too long ago which pays a lot more than I ever got whilst babysitting.\n\nBecause of dedicating my early life to babysitting, I never really had the chance to make many friends during my high school years and have recently found a small group at my new college, let's call them ''Ethan'' (20s M) and ''Spike'' (20s NB) and during the free time I do  have, I travel over to their houses and chill, we sometimes even have group studying sessions (we are all studying in a creative field). \n\nObviously due to this, I haven't been available and have said no whenever I am asked to watch anyone's children, because I am always working or studying. I sometimes even purposefully made plans with Ethan and Spike to escape the possibility of any kids being thrown at me. This means my parents (50s) have taken up the brunt of babysitting and have expressed no issue...until now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister, Frankie (20s F) messaged me to ask if I could babysit her toddler son so she could go out. It required me to stay at hers for basically an entire weekend and I'd have to take the weekend off of work and lose out on \u00a3300-500 in place of the \u00a320 she'd give me for two nights. (I pay mom \u00a375 a fortnight for rent, it's not enough) I also had a final major project coming up that I needed to focus on, so I politely said no. She then replied back with a passive aggressive ''Ugh, well, thanks anyway.'' and left it at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Not even a minute later she asks our mom who flies into a rage and slams her phone on the table, exclaiming that she 'can't do this anymore' and left the room. I went upstairs so she could calm down, and then I got a message from my other sister, Joanne, showing me screenshots of my mom messaging her saying that I'm ''acting like a lazy teenager'' and that I've ''abandoned the family'' for a couple of friends and that I ''needed to take some responsibility'', as If I BIRTHED these kids (which I did NOT). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoanne said she was on my side but suggested I help out just a 'little bit' since our mom is going through menopause and needs the help, and that she got why I said no to Frankie (anytime you say no to her, she whines and guilt trips you until you cave) and invited me over that night to sleep over so our mom could cool off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told Spike and Ethan all of this, and they praised me for putting my foot down because I was ''more than a god damn Mary Poppins for people who chose the wrong people to have children with'' (both of the childrens' fathers ran off when they were babies) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I can't help but feel guilty for just leaving everyone high and dry.

Also, you're not the one who had a kid, and it's not your problem or responsibility. You've helped out for so long, and they got used to you doing that, but it's not right for them to lean on you all the time. I would stick to your guns and say no. \n\nI had this same battle when I quit doing side work in my trade due to injury. So many people got mad at me and never talked to me again because I selfishly stopped dropping everything to help them, even though it caused me pain and I moved on to different things in life.

YOU and your studies and work and friends are much more important than babysitting your niblings.  You have done your time already, for a crime you didn't commit!  Let your grown-ass sisters deal with their own lives and children.  Not your litter; not your kittens!", "NTA. They need to move on and find someone else to keep their kids.", "Nta\n\nNext time you are asked, say \"Yes, for $XYZ [exorbitant amount of money].\"\n\nYou need to be paid for your work. No one is giving YOU a free ride.", "NTA. Good for you for starting to set boundaries. Hold them and focus on school and your social life. Their kids, they can figure out their own childcare.", "NTA. Why exactly can't Frankie look after her own kids for the weekend? She's their mom. If she can't have a fun weekend off then oh well that's what comes with the territory.", "You need to take a page from your mom and say \"I can't do this anymore!\"", "NTA. They imposed on you in the past to the extent that you had few friends! That is obviously not right. They even expect you to take off work to look after their children! Colossal nerve!\n\nYou have more than earned the right to retire. It is time they either find a paid babysitter or stay home if they can't afford one. \n\nStudy hard (instead of babysitting) and get out of your parent's home ASAP.", "NTA. You cave\nOnce and you will never get freedom again. Your moms inability to say no is her problem.  Not yours.  Your sisters got to have fun. That\u2019s how they ended up with babies! Now\nYou can have fun minis the baby lol.", "NTA - Sounds like your sister needs to start taking some responsibility for her child and respect when someone says no to watching her child. Funny how your mom thinks your abandoning your family for your friends when it's your sister who wants you to watch her kid so she can go out.", "If sister has money to go out for a weekend she has money for a real baby sitter.\n\nNTA ever", "Um\u2026 your mum can so no to Frankie too. \n\nIt\u2019s not like its an emergency. \n\nAlso start saving for moving out.", "NTA. This isn't just about setting boundaries but money. You'll lose out on at least \u00a3250 if you babysit. That's just bad business and no way any of your relatives would make up the difference nor would they give up that kind of cash to help you.", "NTA, though if you live with your mother for 150 a month you may wish to find another place to live so they have no control over you.  As it is, you've got an amazing deal on rent so I can see them wanting you to pitch in some(but not constantly)", "NTA\n\nYou should never feel guilty for letting people pull themselves out of the same shit that they had no problem piling on you.\n\nYour mom should've demanded the same peace for you that she's trying to get back for herself. Menopause doesn't make people become manipulative. If anything she should've had sympathy for what you went through. Instead she decided to manipulate her own child by gaslighting you, calling you childish. Because she knows that as your mother...you'll accept whatever she says, because she already knows that you won't think that she would tell you wrong.", "If you didn\u2019t have veto power over who they climbed into bed with, then you have no responsibility for what the result is, NTA.", "Seriously, most parents I know are lucky to get a date night once a year until the youngest kid is 5-6\u2026.. I.e. they are no longer paying for child care just to work.", "This is Frankie\u2019s problem, not yours. If your mom doesn\u2019t want to babysit, she can say that to Frankie and Frankie can source other childcare. NTA", "NTA. If your mom wants you to take time off work to watch your sister's kids she needs to cover your rent for the month (to make up for your lost income and to cover for any potential loss of income that could result from having to miss work).\n\n\nIf you haven't already told your family that you can't afford to babysit for what they pay you/you don't want to babysit anymore (whichever is most true for you) letting them know could help them adjust their expectations.", "NTA\n\nBut you and your mum need to team up and BOTH tell Frankie that her children are not your problem. Tell Frankie that you've done your bit and are done now. Care for her kids is up to her.", "Yikes-the sister gets it from the mom. NTAH!", "Any chance Ethan or Spike have a spare room you could rent from them? NTA, not your kids and not your problem.", "NTA!Good for you for setting healthy boundaries you need to focus on you don\u2019t worry about them you are not responsible for someone else\u2019s children they\u2019re the ones who decided to have kids", "NTA\n\nNot your fault that your mom can't refuse babysitting the grandkids.\n\nThe only real solution is for your siblings to hire actual babysitters to watch their kids.", "NTA - Their children are their responsibility FULL STOP. It's time to concentrate on you and your future you CANNOT viably afford to \"babysit\" for a pittance anymore. That's why they want you to do it cheap labour", "Nta. People who benefit from you not setting boundaries sure get mad when you do, don't they?", "NTA. They're expecting you to actually lose money to baby sit? \n\nThat's what they're asking here.  Since you wern't present at the conception or birth it's not your responsibilty. \n\nAnd best wishes for your studies too.", "You are no acting like a lazy teen. You are planning  your life. you had  done you time. Your mom is an enabler, now she have to do the work she volunteered you for. No one should be watched your siblings' kid so they can go out. Unless your volunteer. Maybe they can watch each other's kids. Good luck in school", "You're working and get a salary, move out, go low contact with everyone except Joanne", "I would make between 300 and 500 working this weekend. Im not just hanging out with friends.  Make that up and im happy to babysit. Otherwise i just cant, i need to make rent\n\nNTA", "I\u2019ve lived this life! I\u2019m currently living it at 19! I wish I had the balls to do what you\u2019re doing. These people are making me never want to have kids lol. You\u2019re NTA.", "If sister has money to go out for a weekend she has money for a real baby sitter.\n\nNTA ever", "NTA.  Why can't your sister get a sitter?  I mean someone who is not family and does babysitting to earn money.\n\nTell your sister if she wants you to babysit she needs to cover the wages that you will lose from taking time off from your job as this is money you need to pay your mother for rent and to pay for your education.", "this is simple. if your sister is willing to subsides your lose in wages you can sit for her. 500bucks on hand. or no hands helping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "You have a job. You have school. You have a life. If she wants a sitter, she can hire one.\n\nNTA", "When you are a young woman who isn\u2019t married and childless for some reason family always think they own you and that you exist to work for them.

She\u2019s having trouble because she never set clear boundaries with at least one of her kids and now that you\u2019re setting your own boundaries she\u2019s having to pay the consequences of her poor parenting.", "NTA you pay rent that your mother charges you. She can't ask you to pay rent and then take away your ability to work for that rent money. Your sister is a mother, her youth and going out days are behind her. It is not your fault that you can say no but your mother doesn't feel she can. Your mother needs to sort herself out because she doesn't want to be the bad guy but also has no problem being abusive to those around her.\nOp, you need to move out. You maybe have 2 supportive friends in Ethan and Spike, maybe brainstorm new living situations or savings. Where you are is not healthy, but your boundaries are. Keep pressing forward.", "NTA the bigger issue at hand is the family thanking you and your mom for granted. I think an honest conversation is needed with Frankie.", "NTA. I used to babysit I would\u2019ve quoted your sister for $900 minimum for that whole weekend and she wasn\u2019t trying to even give you $100. Honestly your mom sounds stressed because you\u2019re finally standing up for yourself keep it up until your able to move out!", "Joanne isn't as bad, It's really my mom that makes her sound bad for wanting one weekend a month off because 'she's raised her kids'. It's Frankie that wants us available constantly so she can go to work or mess around. I hung out with Frankie a couple of weeks after this and she said ''It's really nice that you finally have friends, but it's not nice to forget about your *faaaaaamily!*''", "Oh of course, if it was for medical reasons I'd try my best to fit it in. I watched Joanne's daughter  about a year ago for a few hours so she could go for her pap smear. (she's fine btw)", "Haha yep! my idea of fun is playing the switch with my friends with pizza...not making babies lol.", "She DOES have friends, but they haven't been able to babysit because they have also been busy, so we have woken up some mornings with Frankie banging on the door and begging us to watch her son so she could work. What is infuriating is that she knows of her friends cancelling usually the night before, but 'forgets' to tell us. (?)", "I did pre-warn everyone before starting school and work that I wouldn't be as available and they appeared to accept it, if anything they ENCOURAGED this and told me to make something of myself with the opportunities I've been given. My guess is they've realised how turbulent things are now that I'm not available. I NEVER agreed to babysit this time, I was asked, and I said no after weighing out the pros and cons.", "You're not wrong. I've declared myself dating-free (and potentially child-free) because of the choices my sisters made. I don't want to repeat the same mistakes. (those beautiful children are not mistakes, it's just a shame who their fathers are) \n\nJoanne never dated her daughter's father, he was a one-night stand and a former friend who was already a father, but she still gave him the option to be involved, he declined, and we haven't heard from him since. Frankie however dated hers for less than a month before becoming pregnant and then cried when he jetted off when her son was a new-born. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I were to date, I will, sure as hell, practice **heavy contraception** just to be safe. I've got a degree to think about lol!", "Joanne herself is fine, and only asks for her daughter to sleep over I think once a month so she can relax. It's Frankie who pesters us for weekly childcare VERY last minute so our plans are either cancelled or they are altered to suit her baby. I make myself as busy as possible to avoid this.", "Haha! okay, this made me laugh. I must clarify though that both sisters have a child each...although Frankie does insist on wanting more kids, but considering the father has been MIA since her son was a new-born, it's no doubt it may be from someone else.", "NTA \nThis is not an emergency but just for your sister to have fun. But she decided to be a mom and so knew that fun would be low priority. Your mom just has to say no to your sister, she doesn't need to babysit in this situation. \nYou still live at home so it's difficult, but neither you nor your mother are obligated to babysit for your sister to have fun.", "NTA. Not your monkeys not your circus. Your family is actually quite entitled.", "NTA. They\u2019re not your kids. If you want to help out, fine. If you don\u2019t, also fine. Plus the amount of money you\u2019d lose is nothing to scoff at.", "No, her sister wants her to pay at least \u00a3280 to watch the kids for a whole weekend. OP is losing out on at least that much by babysitting, and will have trouble paying her rent if she does what her sister wants. If that's not a good argument for telling her sisters to kick rocks, I don't know what is.", "Also add that any babysitting OP graciously agrees to do must compensate any lost wages in full. OP can't be losing out on \u00a3300-500 and have trouble paying her rent just because sister wants to party.", "That's not fair to many parents who do, but it certainly would be nice if all parents did that.", "Ethan and I are having casual conversations about moving in together once he has his own job (he's looking) because we're both students studying similar subjects and we live about 20 minutes away from each other...before anyone on here gets any ideas, Ethan is gay \ud83d\ude02", "You're right. She's been like this my whole life and I figured it'd all change now she is an adult, but no.", "I still help occasionally, but I avoid doing whole weekends and I actually ask my boss if I can work extra during the holidays (they always say yes because no one usually wants to work during the holidays) \n\n just so no one asks me to babysit for less. I think everyone's pissed off by this but can't say anything because \u00a3300 is \u00a3300", "I have asked for a certain amount in the past and Frankie hits me with the ''I can't afford that! I'm a poor single mother, can it be \u00a3x/y/z instead?'' and then 'forget' to even pay me that, and when she does remember, she pays it in chunks. (If I asked for \u00a320, I get \u00a35 a month)", "My mum doesn't like how much I pay because she says it's not enough, but I can't work more than the weekends because on the days I'm not working, I'm at college studying. I also need most of the money to pay for the travel there and back as well as my lunches whilst I am out, as well as work uniform stuff. They are all always trying to find a way to get me to pay for money...", "We each live with our families and Spike and Ethan are job-hunting, and Ethan and I are casually looking at rent for student accommodation since we're in the same class and study similar subjects.", "One weekend a month off for a mom with young kids is actually really a lot. I never got that and neither did our friends.\n\nExpecting even more it's beyond entitled.\nTell your mom that she can say no as well, maybe she doesn't realize, and work on moving out soon.", "Did you say as available or unavailable? I'm totally on your side here and can even see myself choosing the former because they can take whatever they want out of 'as available' and that might keep the waters smooth until they figure out I'm never actually going to do it but it really just puts off the same fight you'd get for saying unavailable from the beginning."]}
