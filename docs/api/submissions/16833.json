I also got a new job not too long ago which pays a lot more than I ever got whilst babysitting.\n\nBecause of dedicating my early life to babysitting, I never really had the chance to make many friends during my high school years and have recently found a small group at my new college, let's call them ''Ethan'' (20s M) and ''Spike'' (20s NB) and during the free time I do  have, I travel over to their houses and chill, we sometimes even have group studying sessions (we are all studying in a creative field). \n\nObviously due to this, I haven't been available and have said no whenever I am asked to watch anyone's children, because I am always working or studying. I sometimes even purposefully made plans with Ethan and Spike to escape the possibility of any kids being thrown at me. This means my parents (50s) have taken up the brunt of babysitting and have expressed no issue...until now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister, Frankie (20s F) messaged me to ask if I could babysit her toddler son so she could go out. It required me to stay at hers for basically an entire weekend and I'd have to take the weekend off of work and lose out on \u00a3300-500 in place of the \u00a320 she'd give me for two nights. (I pay mom \u00a375 a fortnight for rent, it's not enough) I also had a final major project coming up that I needed to focus on, so I politely said no. She then replied back with a passive aggressive ''Ugh, well, thanks anyway.'' and left it at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Not even a minute later she asks our mom who flies into a rage and slams her phone on the table, exclaiming that she 'can't do this anymore' and left the room. I went upstairs so she could calm down, and then I got a message from my other sister, Joanne, showing me screenshots of my mom messaging her saying that I'm ''acting like a lazy teenager'' and that I've ''abandoned the family'' for a couple of friends and that I ''needed to take some responsibility'', as If I BIRTHED these kids (which I did NOT). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoanne said she was on my side but suggested I help out just a 'little bit' since our mom is going through menopause and needs the help, and that she got why I said no to Frankie (anytime you say no to her, she whines and guilt trips you until you cave) and invited me over that night to sleep over so our mom could cool off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told Spike and Ethan all of this, and they praised me for putting my foot down because I was ''more than a god damn Mary Poppins for people who chose the wrong people to have children with'' (both of the childrens' fathers ran off when they were babies) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I can't help but feel guilty for just leaving everyone high and dry.

Your mom bless her is also NOT obligated to watch her grandkids(any of them) for free/at the drop of a hat. \n\nYour mom's inability to say no isn't your fault or problem. Your sister(s) and anyone else in the family not having reliable childcare is also not your fault or problem.", "NTA - Nobody is being left high and dry though.   She wanted to go out.  So what, sometime you can't after your kids are born.", "NTA. These are not your children. Also, if babysitting means you\u2019re losing that much money, how does your mom expect you to pay her rent? It doesn\u2019t work both ways- if they can\u2019t pay you enough to balance the losses, of COURSE you\u2019re not going to do it. But also, you\u2019re an adult with your own life and your own responsibilities. You don\u2019t need to babysit for people who can\u2019t seem to raise their own kids. They can find and pay a different babysitter. They\u2019re the ones who chose to have kids. \n\nIs it nice to help out family? Of course. Should you feel obligated to do it to you own detriment? NO.", "NTA. Watching those kids is not your responsibility. You shouldn't be expected to call out of work, cancel plans, etc. just to suit your sister's life. If your mom doesn't want to do it, then your sister can find someone else, but that's HER problem to sort out. Nobody should be mad at you.", "**NTA.**\n\nYou need to focus on your future--which includes making friends, studying, and catching up on a few years of lost socializing.\n\nDon't feel guilty. Your family just isn't used to you flexing your newfound confidence. They'll get over it.", "Totally NTA\nYou are not lazy, you're trying to make your own path in life. It sounds like they got a bit too confortable with the fact that you could always be there to babysit and now your mother and sister think that is your OBLIGATION to answer their every call. Stablishing boundaries is part of being an adult, so it's great that you did. \n\nAnd you should try to get used to shushing the voice that says you're on the wrong... that's just the scars that this kind of manipulative behaviour tend to let. You did great and best of lucks on your final project (if you haven't done it yet).", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for anyone else's children or their ability to go out. I had my oldest child when I was 18, and if I couldn't find anyone to care for him, either he went with me or I stayed home. It was as simple as that.", "So you've been caring for your siblings' kids since you were a kid yourself. That was never fair. You've already sacrificed your formative high school and university social lives because of choices you've never made. Your siblings managed to date and conceive children and it sounds like they are expecting you to continue to make sacrifices for their social lives. Not your circus not your monkeys.\n\n You are a college student in her twenties. It is imperative that you don't let anymore of this time pass you by. Building your own life and existence outside of your primary family is a hugely important part of adolescence.\n\nNTA\n\nYou aren't being an impetuous teenager. You are a young adult trying to gain some autonomy, albeit a little late. You've made enough sacrifices. They should be grateful for what you've done and understand why that time has ended.", "NTA. \n\nYou need to take some responsibility? Please. I\u2019d say you\u2019re taking your own quite seriously. You\u2019re a student and an employee, and you declined to take on a conflicting obligation knowing you\u2019d have to drop one ball to pick up the other. Requesting a weekend off work for her leisure would be irresponsible. Putting off studying so she can go out and have fun would be irresponsible. She\u2019s just upset that you won\u2019t neglect your responsibilities so she can step away from hers, and your mother is upset because you\u2019re not taking on what she feels emotionally obligated to, and her inability to say no is now only affecting her more than she can comfortably handle. Your time isn\u2019t theirs to volunteer. Stick to your guns on this one. They don\u2019t respect you, and you won\u2019t earn that by conceding.", "NTA. You've done more than enough, and it's not up to you to help your sister sort out child care. You'd have to take the weekend off work, and you also have schoolwork to do and a full schedule. \n\nIf they were willing to be reasonable about asking you to babysit, you wouldn't have to fill your schedule as full as you have", "They can hire a baby sitter. Your mom can say no too. Let her know she can literally just say no too. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour mom needs to learn to say no just like you have.\n\nNext time, tell Frankie you\u2019ll babysit if she covers your lost wages and see how quickly she decides your services aren\u2019t worth it.", "NTA Go live your best life!", "NTA. The day parents take responsibility for their Own children, either by caring for them themselves or paying someone a fair wages\u2026. Well I\u2019ll be one of the many people who will probably die of shock.", "NTA for so many reasons. You also aren't a lazy teenager, you're working and studying and making friends and starting to figure out your life, the exact opposite of lazy. Lazy would honestly be doing none of that and taking on $20 a weekend babysitting gigs once in a while with nothing in between. Also, you're not the one who had a kid, and it's not your problem or responsibility. You've helped out for so long, and they got used to you doing that, but it's not right for them to lean on you all the time. I would stick to your guns and say no. \n\nI had this same battle when I quit doing side work in my trade due to injury. So many people got mad at me and never talked to me again because I selfishly stopped dropping everything to help them, even though it caused me pain and I moved on to different things in life. People suck and like to take advantage and treat you like shit when you don't do what they want, aka manipulation. Tell them to pound sand and start working towards getting out of that situation altogether.", "NTA.  Your mother is not required to babysit either, and she can also learn to say no.\n\nI think it\u2019s time to have an honest dialogue with each sibling offender - along the lines of :\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve babysat for you for many years but now I want you to realize that I have a full busy life with school, job to pay for everything, and my own pursuits.   I\u2019m no longer available on a regular basis.  You\u2019ll have to find some more babysitters, maybe ask your own friends for recs, so that I\u2019m not first on your babysitter roster.  I felt like I needed to address this so we are all on the same page and I don\u2019t want any assumptions to cause us issues.   I love you ! (Or some other nice thing at the end - give her the stick then the carrot method lol) \n\n\nThen have one along the same lines with your mom explaining what you\u2019ve told your sisters and also mention that your mother can say no as well.\n\nEdited to add.  When you say you can\u2019t, you don\u2019t have to give some long drawn out reason or explanation of why you can\u2019t.  This may just lead to them trying to rearrange your life for you, try to stick to \u201csorry, I can\u2019t babysit that day/night\u201d, repeat as necessary.\n\nThey\u2019ll double down on you for a bit till they realize it\u2019s not working so stay strong.", "NTA. Not your kids, not your problem.", "So you have put up with this for years and that is ok...but your mum can't cope and you're lazy?\n\nThis is not your job. It is not your mum's job either and she also needs to learn to stand up for herself. Your sister needs to attract a babysitter by paying a decent rate and \u00a320 for a weekend is not it. You have a life and you have no obligation to kids who are not your own.

You don't have to put your life on hold so that your family members can live their lives.  If this starts a huge issue, suggest all of the family giving you shit chip in to pay for an actual babysitter, and not just rely on your free labor.", "No you can't take a loss in a job and babysitting is a job. Your new job pays way more and not your kids not your problem. Now if she had to have surgery or something and asked you to help during that time that would be different. But it's not that so not the ah at all.", "NTA\n\nOnce again you need to break down why you are no longer available for long babysitting jobs or last minute jobs. If a sitter is needed, you need three to four week notice so you can make sure your schedule is free...and if you need to babysit instead of working your actual job, you WILL be charging your hourly rate for babysitting.", "None of this sounds like anything you need to feel guilty about.  There's circumstances in which you might feel guilty... if these folks actually depended upon you in order to get buy.   \n But that's not the case.  You wouldn't be watching Frankie's kid while she goes down to the match factory to earn enough of a pittance to keep them all out of the workhouse, you'd be watching him while she has a fun weekend off.  If nobody will do this for her, oh, damn, she'll have to miss out on something enjoyable, almost like a parent might.

They need to find a new babysitter. Have you been saving to move out? Rent an apartment with your friends? You are having these issues because even though you make yourself scarce, you still live at home. Very much accessible.

Be cautious about trusting Joanne.

Your sister isn't \"high and dry\" because your work and social life is more important to you than her social life.

I said I\u2019d tag along so she got me a ticket. \nLo and behold New Year\u2019s Eve lunchtime I get a text message at lunchtime saying \u201cwe\u2019re going out at 7 see you just before\u201d from the parents. \nI replied back \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve got plans\u201d \nThey literally blew my phone up and then when I stopped replying to their \u201cyou can make plans for another night\u201d messages they called my mum, who was well aware how many weeks they hadn\u2019t paid me. \nShe said \u201cwhen was the last time you paid her?\u201d They weee like \u201coh we just thought she liked looking after the kids\u201d (BS \ud83e\udd2c they got asked multiple times about paying me ) \nMy mom totted it up to roughly \u00a3200 they owed me, then she said as it\u2019s new years she will need more for her transport so she needs at least \u00a370 accounting for the extra hours too and also reimbursement for the ticket for tonight she bought weeks ago when she made her own plans after you stopped paying her. \n\nThey soon gave up and spent the night at home and I finally learned to start enjoying myself.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard when family put pressure on you but you need to back yourself, it sounds like you\u2019ve got two amazing friends there, keep close with them and make more plans even if it\u2019s just eating snacks and watching Netflix, you\u2019ve already got a lot on your plate, time to decompress is important.
