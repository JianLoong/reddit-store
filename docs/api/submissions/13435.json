Just like if someone takes a picture of themselves looking fabulous but your in the pic and you look like a zombie tweaker you wouldn't want them to post it and not crop you out. Teaching our kids how to be good digital citizens means being one. You're new to it, but it sounds like maybe they could give you a few lessons on what is and isn't appropriate to post. No disrespect, I promise. Our kids know way more than they should and if you show you're trying, they'll be happy to share.\nEdit: I agree to the F@&$ the patriarchy posts about yourself and seriously west the bikini with pride!!", "NTA. You and your daughter are adults. Who cares if she doesn't want people all over the internet looking at her half naked body.\n\n I mean who gives a crap if people are teasing her and your son about it. Kids are to fragile. F their feelings.", "NTA - post what you want, fuck it.", "NTAH!! You didn't kno and u took it down. Wth is up with kids saying that to yr kids face...in school talking mean about someones parent and sibling would come with a slapped face. Ik kids can be assholes but that's messed up..really hope they dont consider those \"friends\" \n  Luckily your kids might be upset but give them time..won't be long b4 they are laughing at the mistake.", "NTA. It\u2019s a bikini, you arent naked. Your son is being weird. Keep your photo and enjoy snapchat.", "NTA However it is a good and respectful rule to always check with the other person to ensure they are comfortable with whatever photo you are posting before doing so.", "info: did you ask your daughter if it was okay BEFORE you posted the picture?", "NTa", "NTA. Your post wasn't inappropriate, but the comments were!\nI agree with you removing the post only because your daughter asked you to.", "NTA. I\u2019d be so happy if my mom would have the confidence to post a photo like that with or without me. Go OP! I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re treating you this way. I would definitely have the conversation with your daughter about what you wear doesn\u2019t define you as a person.", "NTA- Your sons friends are boys, and boys are always saying some dumb shit. Your daughter is running for cover because she can't deal with a negative comment. You let your enthusiasm get the best of you. Did you ask your daughter if she was cool with you posting that pic? I doubt you did....in future, clear it with whomever is involved. Also, just because you think it's cute doesn't make it so. Anyone who gets creeped out from seeing two women in a bathing suit is either a moron or a Mennonite.", "It\u2019s hard to vote without knowing a little more information.  Was your daughter okay with you posting the photo and only changed her mind after other (judgmental) people starting chiming in?  Or was your daughter unaware you posted the photo and was uncomfortable with it as soon as she realized you had posted it, regardless of what other people had to say about it?\n\nYou AND YOUR HUSBAND need to talk to your son about his comment regarding how seeing you and your daughter in bikinis was \u201cgross\u201d.  That\u2019s some misogynistic bullshit.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with you and your daughter wearing bikinis at the beach.  Sharing photos of you and your family at the beach, as long as everyone in the photo consents, is perfectly fine.  I\u2019d talk to your daughter about the situation as well.  She shouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable about what she\u2019s wearing just because her brother has gross friends and someone\u2019s mom is a busybody.\n\nGoing forward though, I\u2019d make your social media private to minimize any insecure/misogynistic/judgmental comments from the peanut gallery.  F*ck those pathetic people.", "NTA\u2014 sorry your kids are ducks.", "Say it with me. Internalised misogyny.\n\nBut also for courtesy and consent always show your daughter any pic you plan to post of her first", "And with Connor!!!  He\u2019s the needin\u2019 talkin\u2019 to one!", "Agreed NTA.\n\nOh, and OP, if after two kids you have the confidence to embrace your body and rock a bikini, DO IT! I have 3 kids and only just started feeling comfortable in form-fitting swimwear again.\n\nOP, I also suggest that you have a conversation with your son regarding his views on women and their clothing choices. It may be helpful to encourage him to think about his attitudes towards women and how they (his attitudes) influence his behaviour. Similarly, I recommend having a talk with your daughter about why she feels the need to agree with her younger brother and why she feels ashamed or embarrassed about a photo of you and her in swimwear while on holiday.", "All of this. The conversation might also include how to set privacy settings on social media. I can sympathize with a teenager wanting to build their own identity online, but policing others is not the way. This is an opportunity for OP to teach Connor and Linda how to decide which friends deserve access to their personal lives. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I\u2019m also just not a fan of Bill being neutral about the whole thing. I have a feeling Bill is a little or lot checked out and needs to step it up. But now we are getting into relationship forum territory so I will tiptoe the fuck out.", "Daughter is absolutely not out of line for deciding that she is not comfortable with her mother posting a picture of her in a bikini to social media. Mom 100% should have asked daughter before posting that photo.", "I\u2019m sorry the fighter is brown women with agency and if she doesn\u2019t want her body in a bikini on the internet then it shouldn\u2019t be on the internet regardless of her reasoning. And not wanting your brothers friends to leer at you is perfectly valid reason now matter how much you may disagree", "/thread", "I completely agree with this, but I also think it depends on what the daughter's SM presence is like/what she normally posts or is tagged in. \n\nI have some friends who post bikini pictures pretty frequently and I have some who would be massively uncomfortable if someone uploaded a photo of them in a bikini. I don't personally post much on instagram, and have actually had friends ask if I care if they post/tag a photo of us just in case. \n\nIf OP is new to social media I could see her not realizing that her daughter maybe isn't comfortable having bikini photos out there, and I could see the daughter being uncomfortable with the post. Real life versus social media is odd, some people are perfectly comfortable wearing something and being photographed in it but would be unhappy if that were posted online. Without more information, I'd go with NAH minus the son, son's friends, and Laura's friend's mom who all need to sit down and shut up.\n\nOP, INFO: was this picture something akin to what your daughter would normally post?", "I think that's a really good point to make, that it's generally good to ask before posting a swimsuit pic of ANYONE, regardless.\n\nI also want to give a shout-out to OP for being such a sweet mom and wanting to connect with her kids via social media. I'm 23F now, and if my mom did something like that when I was a teen, it would have melted my heart. Of course I would have been a little a**hole about it, because I was a little a**hole at 16, but ya know \ud83d\ude02 I just think OP is so sweet and clearly this is all coming from a very loving and caring place. \n\nNAH, except Connor could use some redirection regarding his thoughts towards women imo.", "I agree, NAH. Honestly, people post beach pictures all the time. But you should ask your daughter before posting next time", "Completely agree. IMO this comes down to whether or not the daughter was comfortable with the photo before the son/random humans began weighing in.", "Daughter's 19, not a minor", "Yeah, something feels off here. Nothing OP put in her post explains crying for 2 hours straight, or her daughter giving her the cold shoulder. That makes me think that OP either argued against taking it down until things escalated, and/or she\u2019s a huge drama queen and exactly the kind of parent you dread getting on social media to \u201cconnect\u201d with you.", "ESH. While your son may have started it, your daughter the other female in the picture did not want it up. Patriarchy or not it's her choice in being depicted in that manner. If your daughter was ok then this instantly flips to not the ah.\n\nIt's no difference than than if a guy takes a suggestive pic of his gf with her permission. Yes she consented but that doesn't mean he can share the image with his mates. Sharing a woman in bathing wear regardless of familiarity seems to toe that line.", "Just rolls right off the tongue.", "Taylor Swift has a song (All Too Well the ten minute rendition) and in it says \"fuck the patriarchy\". I stand behind it. Alternatively i say \"fuck the system\" because it is inherently patriarchal.", "You seriously ask every single time you post a picture of someone? I don't.  I post pictures of my adult kids, teen kid, & my grandkids all the time. It sounds like the only reason the daughter had an issue is because of the son and his friends being disgusting. I did say that she should take it down if the daughter wants her to.", "Learn words! Patriarchy affects both men and women.

They're not an OF mother daughter duo. Pretty sure it didn't even cross their minds if the swimwear was inappropriate until dunderhead son and friends opened their mouths.

You're ridiculous.", "The daughter can express her discomfort being in the picture, the son though should shut up and stop being friends with boys that sexualize his mom and sister and not try and make the sister feel bad for wearing a swimsuit and taking a picture.", "That\u2019s incredibly rude of you and not the point of this post.", "Just because your parents or your friends do it, it doesn't mean it's right. If I'm going to post a picture of someone online, knowing that once I do, it'll be out of my hands where the photo ends up, I'll ask for permission for sure! If the person isn't fully clothed or is doing something they may not want everybody online to see (friends, family and coworkers), I'll double check! It's not about what's appropriate for me, it's about what they want to show for themselves, independently of my moral assessment.", "It was misconstrued as inappropriate; that's the topic of the post.

Adults can post pics of themselves with other adults, although I personally think it's good manners to ask if it's ok to do so.", "[removed]", "Yes, the son should reflect on the quality of his friends- but as I said, this is a teaching moment. The son should feel able to express his discomfort to his mom and have a healthy conversation about it. Just because his discomfort stems from a misogynistic/problematic origin, doesn't mean he should \"shut up\" and keep his discomfort to himself. Children of both genders should be encouraged to come to their parents to discuss ANY feelings of discomfort, whether or not they are \"in the right\" by feeling that way. Otherwise, how will children learn what is and is not an appropriate feeling of discomfort? Children often have to learn the nuances of what is and isn't ok socially, especially where sexuality is concerned. Fostering open communication is the only way to teach children to overcome problematic societal beliefs and teach healthy emotional development.  If a teen girl was feeling uncomfortable because her peers described her dad's beach photo as a thirst trap,  would you tell her to shut up and keep it to herself? Or would you discuss the fact that her friends have a toxic and inappropriate mindset and she should verbally set boundaries with them? It is the responsibility of parents to help the next generation grow into healthy and emotionally developed adults.", "Yes but then the shaming did happen and now she's uncomfortable. They can't fix that.", "Nope. If other people wearing beach wear to the beach makes the son uncomfortable, mom needs to get him in therapy. Not cater to him and his buddies. \n\nIf mom was posting nudes or risque photos knowing he would see that content, I'd fully agree. But this is a picture of her wearing what every other beach-goer is wearing. He would see as much, if not more, skin at a public pool, on billboards, in the window ads at the mall, or in a commercial. If he can't see something that's not inherently sexual without sexualizing it, he needs help. Not someone to cater to him", "[removed]", "Right!!

Inappropriate, in this situation, likely means gross, so the sons friends are being gross. The son is being ridiculous. He shouldn\u2019t make his mom responsible for his feelings of embarrassment. Like he can be embarrassed, but this is a great learning opportunity for op and her husband to talk to him about why he is embarrassed by a bikini pic. My guess, based on his friends making inappropriate comments, is that his friends sexualized his mom. But then this is also a good time to teach him that it\u2019s not her fault that his immature friends couldn\u2019t handle themselves when seeing a bikini pic of the women in his family. This is how he learns what his boundaries are and how to set boundaries with his friends.", "Embarrassed of his mother and sister going on a beach trip?", "You're trying to be funny, but it just looks pathetic.

You don\u2019t even know what any \u201cschool\u201d of feminism entails given this comment.

And property is passed through the male line.\n\nScholarship whether feminist or not takes that term at its dictionary definition and then actually looks at the consequences of that mode of economic/political organization even after its ostensibly been passed over.

He has the right to express how he feels, NOT dictate what his mom and sister wear or post online. As I said in the first comment, there's really no reason why OP would be wrong for posting the photo unless it was overtly and deliberately sexual. However, if the child IN the photo is receiving harassment for it, and asks that the photo be removed, then mom should consider respecting the child's wishes and just posting a photo of herself in the suit alone instead if she wants. But the son, while it's fine to express how he feels, ultimately has no say in what mom and his sister post, which mom AND dad should explain.", "As a bisexual woman, I think you\u2019re just gross if you feel the need to lear just because you think a woman wants attention.", "Who said I did."]}
