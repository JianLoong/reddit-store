I\u2019d bet nobody would have thought twice if you\u2019d posted those same photos on Facebook.", "NTA just delete the pics with your daughter and if you have any pics of just yourself enjoy posting and post more lol I bet you look like youre having a great time!!! nothing is wrong with women dressing in any way they want I say if we have the rights use them; personally as a woman how I dress is not something I want more regulated but I guess its a good lesson of asking for permission first to post a pic with another person even if it seems totally harmless \n\nunfortunately this is literally slut shaming your sons friends probably sexualized you both and He made it your fault most likely the attention embarrassed your daughter :/ unfair especially so because nothing was purposefully inappropriate you both were simply in swimsuits enjoying vacay its disappointing that womens bodies are instantly deemed inappropriate.", "Connor needs to get the fuck off red pill and his friends need to stop looking at his sister and mom. You are free to post pictures of you and your daughter in bikinis at the beach. You probably look amazing.

NTA and Connor and Linda and whoever else should be asked why are they sexualizing your daughter.", "I'm going to preface this by saying that I don't think the picture is weird. It's not weird to have bikini pics on your profile, it's not weird to have pics with your kids, it's not weird to have pics of you and your kid in bathing suits. \n\nThat being said. Your wording of \"Linda eventually took Connor's side **after she found out**\" really does imply that you posted the pic without asking her. I know that it was a picture of you, but it was also a picture of her. You cannot post pictures of other people without their consent. Yes, even if it's your children. Yes, even if you think that they look good in the picture. You need to ask first, every time, and if they ask you to take pictures of them down you need to do it without arguing. \n\nIf I'm misreading this and Linda knew you were going to post that pic, you're not the asshole. If you posted it without asking her, you kind of are the asshole.", "First: always ask your kids which photos are ok with them before sharing on a public forum. Having said that, they could have just talked to you and be respectful and not give you the cold shoulder since you are just learning the ropes. \n\nSecond: if you are happy with your bikini photos go for it! It\u2019s amazing and really nice to know women are happy with their bodies. \n\nCrop out your kid from the photo and move on.", "One thing that is more common today is asking for someone\u2019s permission before you post a photo of them. My wife has asked me to take down photos that I thought were perfectly benign for personal reasons. Now I ask every time.\n\nNAH but you shouldn\u2019t downplay someone\u2019s insecurities about images they are in. Don\u2019t take it personally, just learn online etiquette and boundaries and keep enjoying it the way you want to.", "Here are some boilerplate conversations you should have\n\nTo daughter: I will always take down any photos you are not comfortable having displayed. However please know that there is nothing inappropriate about wearing a bikini and you have every right to post pictures of yourself wearing whatever you want\n\nTo son: Your friends are the ones being inappropriate. It is not a woman's job to cater to the whims of being sexualizing them for just existing. I expect you to not only respect women's right to be however they wish, but also stand up for the right when other men are being inappropriate\n\nTo friend: Go back to 1920 and cover your ankles\n\nTo yourself: Why the hell are you breaking down over the slightest inconvenience? Actually parent your kids.", "Honestly curious how you\u2019re able to navigate reddit (Created an account today, joined this specific group, and posted correctly according to rules) but haven\u2019t used or know how to use insta which is pretty user friendly?", "NTA, do you live in some sort of conservative area or something?", "INFO: Did you ask your daughter if she was fine with you posting the photo beforehand? You should ALWAYS ask for people's consent before posting something with them in it. ESPECIALLY if the other person is somewhat exposed. Also, many people are fine walking around in a bikini but still don't want pictures of it online.\n\nI'd say the judgement depends on the actions that took place before. If your daughter consented to the post then N T A, but if you didn't ask or if she even said no and you posted it anyway, then Y T A for not following basic etiquette", "NTA.

What prudes!", "\"Connor said it was gross seeing his mom and sister like that anyway and wanted me to take down the post.\" Hasn't he ever seen you both in swimsuits at the beach before?  If it was appropriate for the beach I don't see why it wouldn't be OK to share with friends and family. You're NTA this isn't about Instagram it's about your kids' perception of what people will think. There's tons of nudity on Instagram. Your nipples probably weren't showing or it would have been removed. Then it might be weird. \nI'm sorry this happened. They should chill. I'm sure no one's judging it like they think they are.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nIt's polite to ask people who are in the photo before posting it online- especially if they're less modestly covered than they would normally.\n\nWhile in an ideal world there would be nothing wrong with posting a picture of you and your daughter in the beach, you can't trust that people will actually be decent human beings about it and that's part of internet safety. So yes, you accidentally messed up. Apologize to your daughter, and tell your son to go screw himself, he doesn't get to try and control how you or your daughter present yourself publicly. Maybe uninvite him to the next beach trip and lecture his friends about objectifying women the next time they come over.\n\nBut most importantly, take down the post immediately.", "NTA \n\n>Connor said it was gross seeing his mom and sister like that anyway \n\nAsk him why he's sexualizing both of you.\n\nIt's a swim suit you're not in lingerie for crying out loud! FFS this is just sick and your son should be ashamed not make you and your daughter ashamed. \n\nWhat the hell are we really going backwards like this where women need to wear garbage bags everywhere they go to make every male and religious nut feel safe?! \n\nSkin is skin.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with posting an innocent photo of yourself and your daughter. Your sons friends are perverted little boys who will eventually grow up and realize that they have to treat women like people.", "If someone has a problem with a bathing suit that person is too stupid to worry about. Don't ever allow the bottom of the barrel of society to influence you. NTA", "NTA. You had a fun day with your kid. People are so gross.

Don\u2019t let those haters ruin it", "Connor should be telling his friends they're gross objectifying women in general and his mom and sister in particular.

But you're NOT A for putting them up to begin with.", "And also, she may just not be comfortable and gets to decide her own boundaries.

The worst of humanity - the worst patriarchy, misogyny, racism, classism - is on full display. You can do the smallest thing and mean well and people will shit all over you. The only thing making it worthwhile is that the best of humanity is there too. There are caring communities out there. It might be time to look at the internalized misogyny your kids have and teach them to stick it to the patriarchy instead of buying into it.", "F\\*\\*K the  misandry!  This is another woman giving her a hard time, and somehow it is \"tHe PatRiaRcHy!\".  Get real.", "Not sure that a 16 year old male counts as \"the patriarchy\", and the other mentioned complaint came from a woman, which the sister is also said to agree with. That's 2 (adult) women and 1 (minor) man doing the oppressing in this scenario, being blamed on \"the patriarchy\". \n\nWhile I absolutely agree that no woman should have to consider any man when it comes to how she chooses to dress, I have to wonder how this situation would be received if we swapped the genders, especially since this response (and many others) are making it into a gender inequality issue. \n\nIf it was a 56 year old man, posting a pic of him and his 19 year old son wearing speedos, I bet the reactions would be quite different, and nobody would have any problem shaming the gross old man for forcing everybody to see more of his junk than anybody wants to see. I doubt anybody would defend the man's choice of clothing, or try to blame the matriarchy for oppressing him, and nobody would see the man as somehow victimized by anyone's disgust over his near-nude pic that he chose to share on the internet, upsetting his teenage daughter who isn't comfortable seeing her dad and brother in speedos. \n\nSo, if it is ridiculous for one gender, it must be ridiculous for the other(s). Everybody must be free to expose as much of themselves as they please, or nobody is free to. Otherwise, the only gender inequality issue here is a bullshit double-standard.", "His friends follow the sister. They're definitely leering.", "Yeah unless it's a see through bikini, or they're both making a lewd gesture in the photo, or advertising an OF.....no one has a right to be judging OP for sharing the photo.
