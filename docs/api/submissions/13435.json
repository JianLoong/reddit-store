Your sons friends are jerks, that\u2019s not your fault. He should pick better friends.", "NTA. You posted pics of you and your daughter in appropriate beachwear.

You are new to these platforms, so you are not an AH for not knowing. Your daughter is not an AH for being upset.  It was the correct move to remove the picture after finding out your daughter is uncomfortable. \n\nYour son is a bit rude for blaming you instead of telling his friends to not be creeps, but he\u2019s a teenager, so it\u2019s understandable.", "I'll say YTA simply because you didn't ask your daughter for consent (or so it seems).", "NTA because I think to be an arsehole there has to be some sort of intent and you clearly meant well.

Your son needs to realise that every girl he's ever masturbated over is, aside from being a human being, *someone's* mother, or daughter, or sister.

There is enough pressure about body image these days let alone having your mother post a pic of you.\n\nFrom your side it may be innocent, but every male that has the ability to view your feed can now see your 19year old daughter in a bikini.  That's not a decision you get to make for your daughter.", "NAH.\n\nI'm going off of intent. You did not intend to make your daughter, or your son for that matter, uncomfortable posting the photo. It was you showing off having a nice time.\n\nI will say this though. The world doesn't need to see/know every little intimate detail of your life. Take photos for yourself to enjoy and reminisce over, not to post on social media, especially when other people are in them and may not agree with having it posted.\n\nI'm a 30yo male. I don't have social media by choice and my wife is very limited on it. My mother however will take photos of everyone at every gathering or diner or outing we have and then post them on social media. My wife and I hate it because we are private. We've established that boundary with my mom who has become better about leaving us out of her posts online.\n\nThis maybe an opportunity to talk with your family about their feelings towards you posting pictures of them online. Even just \"normal\" photos. Some people just don't want the world to know everything they are up to or doing or wearing or eating and that's okay. Some people want the world to be intimately involved in what they do and as long as it only affects THEM that's okay too. \n\nSelf reflect on what you use social media for and use it accordingly, just don't bring in family members or kids that don't wish to be included.\n\nAgain, NAH, it's just sometimes people, nonmaliciously, don't think about the other people included in what they post and they just need to be reminded that not everyone has the same feelings about social media.", "NTA- they're having inappropriate thoughts, it doesn't sound like an inappropriate picture!", "ESH\n\nI can't speak to the culture you grow up in. This is really dependent on that.\n\nIn some cultures, posting a photo like that isn't acceptable.

She is a young adult and still feeling out her boundaries with social media.", "YTA - you posted a photo of your daughter that she feels is inappropriate and asked you to take down. The correct course of action is to take it down and apologize to your daughter.", "NTA it\u2019s not like you\u2019re posing in lingerie for playboy with you daughter in response to her friends mom. Your son is just embarrassed his friends made inappropriate comments. I would remove the photo out of respect for your daughter as she is in it and doesn\u2019t like it.", "YTA.

Your son should have taken them to task instead of blaming you for still looking amazing at 56.\n\nYou should have asked your daughter before posting it, because she should be given a chance to consent to having her photo posted on someone else's social media.
