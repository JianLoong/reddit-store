I am a 20 year old mother to a 1 year old little boy who has more energy than I could have ever imagined. I am tired all the time, and he has trouble getting on a sleep schedule and that is okah. I'm not gonna give him sleeping pills because I'm \"tired and need him to go to sleep\". This is fucked up on so many fucking levels man.\nYoure NTA for freaking you but you are ta for not calling the fucking cops as soon as she kicked you out.", "NTA. I used to joke about NyQuil in the baby bottle.  Doing it is criminal!  I\u2019m surprised none of her children have died", "PARENTS GIVE THEIR CHILDREN HOT MILK OR MAYBE IN SPECIAL CASES MELATONIN, NOT FUCKING HEAVY MEDICINE!", "You are NTA but you will be if you don\u2019t report her. That\u2019s child abuse.", "I never gave my kids anything to make them sleep.", "NTA\n\nThose children are in danger! Call Protective services for their safety!", "Nta. Have you seen the list of side effects for seroquel? \nLet alone this from the drug wiki \"Despite being widely used as a sleep aid due to its\u00a0sedating\u00a0effect, the benefits of such use do not appear to generally outweigh the side effects\". It looks like it's approved for use in ages 10 up but I assume she's not a doctor, if she ever screws up her dose she could harm her children..let alone the presumable lack of medical information about its use in small children.", "NTA\n\nCall the police, call CPS this is dangerous and you will be the AH if you don't do these things and something happens to these kids", "NTA. She setting her children up for a life of addiction. Call child protection. They should provide education and monitor her parenting. It may blow up your family, but you must protect the children; or the family will be blown apart by addiction anyway.", "NTA. At. All. \n\nIf she is legitimately giving her children sleeping pills or anti-anxiety medication, call CPS or DHR or whoever protects children in your area. It'll be hard but someone has to help those kids. That is outright abuse. I am all for letting people parent the way they feel is best but if someone were to hit, drug or otherwise harm a child, you best fucking believe I'm tearing walls down to stop it.\n\nYWBTA if you do not do anything.\n\nETA: Just saw she is giving them Seroquel?? That drug had me literally falling asleep while standing and holding my newborn! I am still recovering from the damage it did to my sleep cycle and I was only on it for 2 years while being off of it for 1. She is destroying her children. There has to be some kind of recourse you can take in your country. Even though it's available over the counter, I cannot imagine that this isn't drug abuse. And it's being inflicted on children.", "NTA, this is an abuse issue right here.  And Seroquel???  That's a serious drug that's not even approved in kids.  She could seriously injure or kill them.  This is 100% a 'call Children's Services\" situation.", "NTA. That is CPS bad.", "NTA, she is completely insane, you need to call CPS!", "Not only knows about it but probably did the same back then? Since she literally said \"all parents give their kids a little something to make them sleep\".", "~AITA had me talk to you again~", "Absolutely.  This HAS to be reported.", "I thought the sleepy pill was melatonin not this. She\u2019s endangering her kids. Your aunt and cousin have issues and those kids need taken from that home before one of those kids OD. NTA unless you don\u2019t do anything to help those kids.", "Im 1000% sure it does need a prescription, are you use you have the name of the medication right?", "Info: where are you getting this without a prescription?\n\nIt is NOT approved for under 10. \nAt the very least blood pressure must be monitored regularly for pediatric patients which means dr supervision. \n\nThis is straight up abuse.", "OP Please call the police now. They need to be tested if there is anything in their system. This could have life long effects", "In Mexico you dont need prescription, at least they dont ask for one when i buy my own", "Evidence of where her parents were before and after their dinner.", "Hair samples were tested.", "Why are you calling her and not the authorities?? You realize if you don't and  something happens and you knew about it , said nothing you could lose your kid as well? This isn't a \"talking\" issue there are kids with their actual life on the line. Think if someone did that to your child. They have no chance if you don't help them NOW. \n\nYou're NTA now but if you call her and not the authorities you are and will forever be TA. You don't need to record anything a simple blood test will show everything in their systems.", "It is NOT sold over the counter. Prescription only. I hope you're getting how serious this is.", "That is SO unsafe for kids... it's a serious med.  There are full-grown adults taking that dose nightly.  Seroquel should be taken under a doctor's supervision... she is not getting these legally.", "You need to contact the authorities immediately. She is doing serious, serious harm to the children. They need to be taken from her. She needs to be in jail. This is not a \u201clet\u2019s have a chat situation\u201d. This is a, she is drugging her children and possibly causing them permanent physical harm situation. This is child abuse.", "Im pretty sure you have the name of the drug wrong then, I would be shocked if theres any country in the world where quetiapine/seroquel is not a prescription drug.", "From an online dr in the mother\u2019s name?", "You can buy it without a prescription in my country, and yes, im grasping how serious this is, i just...im struggling a little to get around the fact that, apparently, half of my family medicate their kids to sleep and its hard", "I knew it was bad, but wow it\u2019s so much worse than I thought. OP needs to report her sister to everyone. Schools, CPS, honestly calling the police wouldn\u2019t be taking it too far at all in this situation. What the fuck.", "Im not from the US, i dont know where she takes my nephews and niece as we dont actually hang out a lot", "Lets not go around making random statements about medication- seroquel is used by millions of people for many many reasons. No one should take it without a prescription or drug anyone else, ever, but its just factually incorrect to imply its only used for obnoxious intrusive thoughts.", "Does jmfhc mean Jesus MF-ing H Christ? Because that what my brain read it as."]}
