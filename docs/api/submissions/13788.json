People who have seen my work say it\u2019s heirloom/museum quality, so I\u2019m not just going off my own opinion that it's good.\n\nMy husband, John (47M) (names are fake), & I\u2019ve been married for 17+ yrs (together \\~5 more before that). John is the oldest, then John's sister, Samantha (46); then their much-younger half-brothers, Rob (38) & Seth (36). Thus, I have considered Rob & Seth \u2018family\u2019 since they were kids.\n\nI often crochet for family. Samantha asked me to make a beach cover-up; MIL asked for a sweater; they've each received afghans & scarves; 1 cousin got a baby afghan, another a set of placemats, etc. All of those items were well received. Also, John has several scarves & we have afghans all over the house.\n\nEverything was fine, until Rob married Joanne \\~3 years ago. John & I bought them 2 things off their registry at \\~$25. I also got them a set of napkin rings, & made them a matching set of 8 coasters, 8 napkins & a tablecloth. Between store-bought items/materials purchased/time invested, I\u2019d value the whole gift at over $5K. John & I got a note signed by just Rob, thanking us for \"the gift.\" Joanne didn't like the crocheted items - they weren't store-bought, & didn't \"fit her aesthetic.\" \n\nRob & Joanne had a baby boy, Charlie, \\~1 year later. For the shower, I made 2 baby afghans. I wasn't able to attend due to cancer/chemo (I'm in remission now), but sent the gift via MIL. Never got so much as a \u2018thank you\u2019. \n\nI saw, \\~3 mos after Charlie was born, a cute pattern for a baby's sweater/hoodie; I had some extra red & green yarn, so I made it for Charlie, again, sending it via MIL who was babysitting. Joanne sent a message back via MIL: \"Thanks, but I'm not exposing Charlie to bright colors, so if you send any more hand-made junk for him, could it at least be in the muted colors that I prefer?\" \n\nSeth & Diana are engaged & the wedding\u2019s in July. I was planning on, again, buying a couple of small things from the registry, but also making a tablecloth, with a different pattern, which is honestly much more intricate than the one I made for Rob & Joanne. I have quite a bit of it done. \n\nBut now I'm hearing from MIL & Samantha that the last time they babysat for Charlie, Diana & Joanne were complaining about the ornaments, laughing about the \"kitschy handmade crap\" I\u2019d made for Rob & Joanne\u2019s wedding & saying how Diana would likely get the same. The dictionary says \"kitsch\" is \"art in poor taste, yet with a certain ironic appeal.\" I don\u2019t think my work fits that, but far be it from me to force things on people who don't want/won't appreciate them.\n\nSo, WIBTA if, rather than giving Seth & Diana the tablecloth PLUS something small from the registry (a gift equivalent to what Rob & Diana got from us), we JUST buy something off the registry? And, since I\u2019ll finish it anyway, give the tablecloth to my best friend, instead? Honestly, I\u2019ll probably cave, because I do love Seth, it\u2019s partly for him, & Diana's comments aren't his fault.

It doesn't matter if your crochet items are museum quality or cost a lot - they don't like crochet. So constantly being gifted something they don't like when you know they don't like it makes YTA too.\n\nUse your crochet talents for people who love it, take the hint and start gifting them things they want. And in the meantime they should apologize for being rude.

Yes, these people are incredibly rude but saying this as a knitter, giving people things they don't like simply because you like to make them is also rude (not AH level but a bit of tunnel vision). Keep in mind who the gift is for,your SIL and MIL asked you to make them things. I am guessing your husband's half-brothers and their wives have never asked for anything nor complimented your items. If it's not their aesthetic don't force it on them.", "NTA but may I respectfully say that not everyone likes crochet? Yes your in laws are being unnecessarily rude but it sounds like you kept on giving them gifts expecting a different reaction (ie a more thoughtful thank you note).\n\nI say this as someone with many aunties who do crochet to museum quality. They always give me the most elaborate items, that inevitably end up in a cupboard as I just can't 'appreciate' them. They know I don't really like them and don't use them at home, still I keep on receiving this stuff in the hope that I will learn to value this craft or art as they call it.

Where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s actually bad form to gift something not from the registry unless it was discussed/approved before. \n\nFor example, before gifting a hand-made something, it would be expected that a convo took place so that everyone knows about and is good with it. (Maybe not the what but the colors. Or maybe the what but not the colors. This allows for some surprise but also ensures that the gift is welcome and appreciated.)\n\nYou have done a lot of work, & I don\u2019t want to discount that. It\u2019s very sweet.

Save your art (& such thoughtfulness) for people who do appreciate it.", "A very gentle YTA. You need to change your perspective on gift giving. People have different tastes and styles, and the purpose of a gift is to bring joy to the person receiving it. I, for example, have zero crochet items in my home and believe me, it's no accident. If a new in-law were to completely ignore my own tastes and suddenly start gifting me crochet pieces that change a room it would tell me that they have zero interest in who I am or what I like. Your relatives should have found a polite way to express that they don't want such gifts but please stop what you're doing and stick to the registry.", "ESH. They obviously don't like the crotcheted gifts and they TOLD you so - however rudely. \n\nWhy are you still gifting them stuff you know they don't like?", "People have registries for the sole purpose of letting other people know what they want / need.

They don't appreciate it so your efforts are wasted. You are probably feeling bad because that's how you *give* love to those around you.

Is there gold in them?", "NAH.  I quite frankly don\u2019t understand why you have continued to do this when you\u2019ve probably already gotten the vibe they are not cherished.  Example, did you see the tablecloths etc used/ displayed.   Did you always use colors that don\u2019t match their home?  \n\nThey were rude to say what they said BUT you were not present.   I think other SIL and MIL , in outing the others, MAY have been trying to tell you stop putting so much effort into something that isn\u2019t appreciated by throwing the \u2018married in\u2019 SILs under the bus.", "Save your handmade crafts for someone who clearly will appreciate.  Everyone has different style and if they don't like it they will not use it so it's actually a waste of your time and energy.\nThey are pretty rude to comment your crafts like that, but just a reminder the best gift is something people really want not what you can do best or what you think they might need.\nJust pick something from registry and give the tablecloths to someone who will cry happy tears receiving them.", "YTA for giving people handmade gifts when they have clearly expressed that they don't want them. Why would you want to waste your time and effort like that?", "I cannot believe this woman is \"not exposing\" her kid to bright colours. Does she buy exclusively from those catalogues that lady on Insta (or Tiktok or whatever) makes fun of in a fake Werner Herzog accent? \n\nAnyway NTA I just wanted to comment that that's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard and I hope this kid rebels against his mom's incredibly boring aesthetic by insisting on a neon mohawk hairstyle as a teen.", "YWNBTA. While I would personally be trilled to receive something hand made with love, it sounds like they would not be as grateful. At this point, I would say don't volunteer any more of your time for those ingrates. If you wanted to get them a slightly larger gift from their registry, I would understand, but don't feel obligated. Plus, I suspect that if you did, Samantha would complain that you spent more on them  \n\n\nIf Seth feels left out, feel free to explain to him how you felt the gift would be unwanted due to Diana's comments with Samantha. Heck, you could even hold off on giving it to a friend so that if something is said you can say 'well, it's here if you want it'", "Guess what someone people think crochet are ugly. Very ugly. I would never use anything  crochet in my house cause it's not my cup of tea. So stick with the registry. I have a feeling someone of your family and friends are just being nice to about it.", "NTA.

They don't deserve anything handmade.\n\nI have a full sized crocheted bedspread my mom made; she made my sisters and I the same one in different colors.

She had to hustle to make the second one when auntie learned she was having twins.", "NTA. Don't make it for people who are rude like that. Buy off their registry. If your BIL ask, make something for them if they want but specify, it's for them.", "NTA. But before you decide not to give the home made stuff I would suggest speaking to BIL. He may like it or he can chat to fiancee about it. But moving forward I would only make things for people who appreciate them", "I think you should approach them directly and say that given Joanne's reaction to the handmade things you've given her, you want to check beforehand if they'd like handmade goods. If they say no, just take them off the list.", "YWNBTA but I think the best solution would be to talk directly to them about it and explain that you were planning on making them x item but you had heard that it wasn't really their aesthetic and wouldn't like to gift them something that wouldn't be used (try to do this in a non-accusatory manner). Then you'll be able to explain that it's not due to a difference in the amount that you care about your BiL's but that you just want to make sure that the gift is something they actually want. That way the ball is in their court.", "NTA. I crochet and knit, so I know how much work goes into an item. BUT I also know that presents should be with the person who gets them in mind and so I never make anything unless: specifically requested or I know the person getting them would love it because of how they comment on anything else I made or something like that. \nWe all love our craftwork, but tastes vary and it\u2019s easier for everyone to go with what a couple wants (that\u2019s what the registry is for) than spend hours of labour on something that will not be loved.", "NTA", "since they dont appreciate the thought and time that went into your work then u just buy them one fork and one knife and u know what they can do with it.   they dont appreciate and realize your leaving a beautiful legacy of love behind in making those things to remember u by one day.", "YWNBTA. Joanne knows exactly what she\u2019s doing with the comments and she sounds rude as hell.

Whether OP knew from direct contact about things or through more tactful passing of thr info from their other relatives; OP knew the items being made were not the style of the recipient/s or didnt fit their needs (could be for example that they dont have a glass top to put over their table to keep the crochet flat and allow cleaning, and with small kids it would be impossible to not have it filled with crumbs and covered in stains... I would say it obviously wouldn't suit any more than a thin pillar with a priceless vase sitting precariously on top would suit the entryway to their home.\n\nI do see your point about the value to buyers or sellers, and don't disagree, but ultimately this is a gift OP knows the recipient won't like and isn't to their taste for decor (they're a couple and share a home so one no is all that's needed to veto, two yes answers are required generally).\n\nSomeone else said it better elsewhere, it's like getting someone a gift relating to your hobby that they don't share. If they didnt like consoles or gaming, getting someone a PS5 as a gift would be equally poorly recieved, much as its generous and widely considered a good gift, the recipient is the person(s) whose opinion on the item/s really matters.\n\n\nAlso, while I still agree OP undersold the pricing for time. I would imagine they weren't at top speed while ill, and also that it's unlikely that the blanket and place settings took 2190/2738 total hours of labour, no matter how intricate the pattern, assuming their experience means they're as speedy at crocheting as most folk who have been doing it long enough to be proficient/skilled.\n\nNo shade if OP has dexterity issues or something and it takes them longer than others, it just means they should be more careful when choosing to dedicate that limited time and ability to making a gift for someone. They should be sure that it is something that would be appreciated as an item outside the attached cost of labour hours, materials, and difficulty/quality. From a receiver perspective, as well as not liking the item, they may also feel bad that OP dedicated that time to making an item they knew wouldnt be enjoyed while they should have been recovering.\n\n\nTo me, a good gift doesnt come with an expectation that the reciever should appreciate things by proxy, when they mean a lot to the giver. I always go for what someone wants/needs and/or something they consume generally themselves, and these are always well received. Here, they've the added bonus of having had access to a wedding registry where the couple have put items they want/need and would like to recieve as a gift, if they would be equally happy and thankful if everyone ignored that and gave them tablecloths they wont use, it sort of defeats the purpose of a registry altogether.", "I think it's bizarre that you're spending SO much time making something that won't be valued.

Joanne was unnecessarily rude.", "sure, but there are more polite ways of telling someone you dont like crochet then telling them \"if you insist of gifting me your hand-made junk\". gift is in the intend and mocking someone for their gifts behind their back is highly disrespectful, when there is *thought* behind the gifts. yes the SILs dont like the gifts, but the intend is VERY different than, for exemple, if she bought some random crap in a used store because she couldnt bother.\n\nyou can just say \"your crochet is really not my style, so i would prefer you stop gifting it to me/my baby. it is a waste of your time\". when my MIL is giving me wool socks, gloves, sweaters, etc. i tell her when the shape of the stuff is not good for me, or i know i'll keep receiving them and i can blame only myself.", "It's worth less than nothing because of the burden of storing it. It's rude to say they don't appreciate the gifts, but if they act appreciative, OP will keep wasting time and materials and adding clutter to their homes. It's awkward.", "Asked by every person who has not crocheted or knitted \ud83d\ude02 No offence meant just find it funny. If only you knew the effort time and material wise to make something smh", "Agree. The items that people requested are in style - the bathing suit covers, scarves, crochet tops are very in to wear over tanks. \n\n\nTablecloths and home decor, not at all. Except amagurumi, that's super super cute. If she made the kid a crochet teddy bear I bet that would go over well.", "I use tablecloths but not crochet ones. Especially not handmade crochet ones because we spill stuff on then all the time.", "Red and green is a really unpleasant color combination and is really not common outside of Christmas so I kind of think the comment from the mom might be more a flabbergasted wtf regarding the taste level of a crochet red and green sweater made of leftover yarn rather than some kind of beige obsessed mom. Might be a beige obsessed mom,  but also, I cringed when I read about the sweater because ick and I might have been just as confused and trying to explain why that's going straight to Goodwill.", "I've not heard the bright colours thing before but I've seen a growing and worrying trend of parents being hyper-controlling of every tiny bit of their child's life, including literally never letting them out of their sight, insisting on always playing with them (no independent play time whatsoever) or filling their days with activities so there isn't a single moment for the child to develop independent thought. \nI only hope this new generation rebels by going absolutely bats* crazy with hairstyles, music taste and taking up extreme sports. It'll be deserved.", "i find this a strange take. even when someone gives me a handmade item that isn\u2019t too my taste, i\u2019m happy that they put effort and skill into making something just for me. i like to paint cards for people on special occasions, should i only do that for people who\u2019ve specifically said they like my style?\n\ni can understand not giving handmade gifts to people who say they DON\u2019T like the work, but i don\u2019t see an issue with crocheting something for a friend who hasn\u2019t previously raved about crochet.", "Maybe just ask them?  You could say, this is a family tradition on our side, however I\u2019ve heard that it has not always been appreciated or wanted in the past, so before I do this for you, would you like it?", "I'd say you're a bit of TA to yourself. I love knitting and crocheting. And I know how much time and money (good yarn isn't cheap!) goes into it. But if, after one gift, someone proves to be \"not knit-worthy\" (or not crochet-worthy in your case), they won't get anything else from me. Why would I essentially pour hundreds of dollars/euros/pounds/[other currency] into something if it's not as appreciated as something bought from the shops?\n\nDo yourself a favour and see who really appreciates what you do, and redirect your energy to them. :)", "The girls aren\u2019t the problem either. You are. You didn\u2019t bother to think about how they might want to decorate their houses, and are now acting like you are the offended party. A coffee sleeve is a personal item. A tablecloth is not.", "So dont make him anything, and if he asks, let him know that his wife and sil were shitting all over your hard work, mocking you, and you have no desire to be so insulted or disrespected again.", "A reusable to-go sleeve for a coffee cup is something for general casual use. In the tablecloth + matching items, you\u2019re essentially trying to decide how they decorate their table for special occasions. It\u2019s too big a deal \u2014 and something people would usually have at most one of \u2014 for it to be based on your taste rather than theirs.", "I mean, if something is valued at over $5k, don't you want to know it will actually be used and appreciated? Like, yeah, there are gracious ways to accept (or even reject!) a gift that you don't want, but that doesn't change that the time and money has gone to waste.", "She doesn't need to be grateful, but it doesn't excuse being rude. Like, if someone gives you a gift you don't like you say thank you and then donate it / sell it to someone who'd like it. What you don't do is insult the gift and the hard work someone put in it.", "Nothing someone makes who cares about you is **handmade junk**, and if it is, maybe you\u2019re the trash.", "I was just thinking that. I also crochet, and have a couple pretty afghans that DO fit my aesthetic, yet I would never have a crochet tablecloth or napkins or placemats or coasters... that shit is so ugly and out of style, and just gets nasty anyways, lolol. Like there's so many amazing patterns and potential for the craft, but this woman isn't even bothering to pick out a pattern for something they might actually want. She's just making whatever crap she wants to make and patting herself on the back for unloading it on other people who now have to keep it around or feel like a jerk. Such a back-handed, self-serving approach. And her coming in all smug like \"well fine, they don't get any of my art if they don't want it!\" as if it's a punishment and not exactly what they want her to do. I don't know why this annoys me so much but she's absolutely an asshole in my mind, if not for the gifting then just her bitchy attitude.", "Yeah, I can\u2019t quite let go of how rude and obnoxious this woman is being about the gifts. I\u2019m not sure crocheted coasters would be my vibe but I\u2019d definitely a) keep my mouth shut and b) be open to the vibe on the more traditional knit things.", " You didn\u2019t bother to think about how they might want to decorate their houses, and are now acting like you are the offended party.", "You could do Tunisian crochet placemats.  It produces a  thicker cloth.  Or lace placemats over burlap if they have a shabby chic vibe.  But it would have to be for a pretty specific setting.  Not for everyone.", "To be fair, I don't think they expected that to ever get back to OP - surely that's on MIL for not cushioning the blow a bit more? And OP is planning on not making the gifts as if it's some kind of punishment - she thinks she might be TA for NOT making the unwanted gifts. I think the outcome is the right one but OP's approach is still quite skewed.", "I think Joanne was rude but you have to wonder if she perhaps in the past tried to tell OP thank you, but no thanks indirectly and OP never got the hint.\n\nStill doesn't excuse being rude but there could be missing reasons OP isn't mentioning or didn't get before.", "That\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re going to spend 5000 making a gift you know they don\u2019t want cuz they didn\u2019t say it to your face. Probably to protect your feelings. YTA", "The gift may be at least half for Seth, but a tablecloth is a gift for family use. Giving a newly married couple a decorative item that one of them doesn\u2019t like, in the hopes that the other will like it enough to fight to use it, isn\u2019t kind.\n\nIf you want to be sure, talk to them. In all of this, it sounds like you don\u2019t talk to them at all.", "You really expect them to tell you to your face the gifts are unappreciated? Take a hint already. Stop throwing pearls before swine. \n\nNTA for just going off the registry this time, but you are a glutton for punishment for making all those things and expecting a different reaction after the first cold response.", "You are looking at this BACKWARDS - don\u2019t wait for someone to tell you to stop.  instead Wait for them to ask you to make something.  That way you know it\u2019s wanted and will be appreciated.\n\nIn the meantime, direct your talents elsewhere.  I knit a LOT,  but instead of burdening my loved ones with stuff, I knit for the local cancer center.  They give knitted and crocheted afghans and hats to new chemo patients, and it\u2019s loved because everyone is part of the same club, so to speak.\n\nFind a local hospital that gifts knitted items to patients, or newborns or whatever.  Then you can make as much stuff as you want and still feel good about yourself.", "It\u2019s high value to people who like it. She wasted her own time by not bothering to know or ask her SILs. I knit but I also ask my friends if they would like a baby blanket AND something off registry and ALWAYS ask about and account for nursery preferences. People don\u2019t have unlimited storage for gifts they don\u2019t like.", "You're describing the cost, not the value. It might cost that much of your time but it's only worth 5k if someone's willing to pay that for it.", "I knit and crochet and the phrase \"museum quality\" is literally just a made up phrase she used to sound good. There's no such thing as \"museum quality\" crochet because there's no such thing as a museum that displays crochet for being good...\n\nMaybe she means she could enter it in a state fair?", "Ok but to them it\u2019s worth zero because they wouldn\u2019t spend any money on it", "What kind of tablecloth can also double as a queen-sized bed spread? That sounds horrible. \n\nAnd you made a red and green sweater out of leftover yarn? Those colors go together at Christmas and only Christmas. It's a really unpleasant color combination otherwise. \n\nYou may be spending a ton of time on this but your taste level seems questionable.", "It might have cost you the equivalent of $5000 in materials and labor, but would anyone pay $5000 if you put it for sale on Etsy?", "I don't understand you.\n\nYou were going through an extremely difficult time, you needed to rest and relax. Yet you spent 18 months every day working on this super elaborate gift that you had no clue if the recipients will even like. All you had to do was chose a gift or two from the wedding registry and be done with it. You set yourself up for failure. \n\nYou could've spent all those months working on some other crocheting project and just focus on yourself.", "I knit and crochet. I would never value one of my items at 5k.", "Yeeeah I don't care what the colour combo is, if someone makes you a craft you thank them and if you don't like it you quietly give it away. You don't tell them it's \"junk.\" Mom sounds rude as fuck.", "Yeah I\u2019m all honesty I\u2019d have to see her work before i could praise it. I\u2019ve seen some butt ugly crochet that the makers insisted were amazing, only because their loved ones didn\u2019t have the heart to tell them it was awful. If all of her stuff is bright color crochet I have to wonder if it isn\u2019t just the Barbie dress toilet paper cover quality\u2026.\nA crochet tablecloth could either be beautiful or look like puke. There\u2019s a wide spectrum", "Or they could stop being rude and put the gift in a drawer if they don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s common courtesy not to complain about a gift.", "The definition of junk:\nold or discarded articles that are considered useless or of little value.\n\"the cellars are full of junk\"\n\nI mean,  a giant handmade crochet tablecloth... it will sit in a closet (or cellar) gathering dust. It's literally junk. Just because she spent time on it doesn't mean it's useful or of value.\n\n\nThe value is that it shows how much she \"cares\", but she didn't care enough to get them something about them,  she gifted them something any HER. \n\n\nShe's martyring herself spending tons of money and effort on something that just demonstrates that she doesn't know the couple at all.", "If they cared, they would get to know you better instead of getting themselves a gift multiple times", "There are charities that take crocheted or knitted sweaters.  That might be something for OP to look into.", "The note about the baby outfit and the pieces where she sent messages with other people do actually make her seem rude.", "People that speak behind others backs without a chance to defend themselves are trash. Period. Nothing good comes from unkindness.", "I do suspect that the SIL or even her hubby tried to tell her indirectly her handmade gifts weren't necessary as a way to get her to stop w/o being rude and OP unfortunately didn't take the hint.  Joanne being rude was her last resort to get OP to stop.\n\nOP, it's the thought that counts but not eveyone wants crocheted stuff around their house.  Your MIL and SIL made requests for them.  The SILs did not.  Not being thanked for the afghans and was their way of trying to get you to stop w/o being AHs.\n\nI have to ask, is your constant crocheting of stuff for them even after you were snubbed your subconcious way to let them know their \"place\" in the family?  Sounds like you were the only DIL for quite a long time and you're now having the share MIL's time with them.  I just ask because you seem to have an attitude about them.", "I agree. That's such a good idea. Op could learn how to crochet octopuses for premature babies. Lots of women that like crocheting in my area do this. It's a win-win for ladies who want to crochet and hospitals that need these octopus donation.", "This is what I was gonna ask. What is museum quality of crochet items? Such an odd phrase", "I think what\u2019s meant is that it\u2019s the quality of work equivalent to something that would have been treasured as an heirloom and passed down, preserved for the future.\n\nBut the \u201cmuseum quality\u201d expression, combined with the nature of the pieces, strongly suggests that OP is trying to promote traditional behaviour in its use: it\u2019s all \u201chere are your dining table decorations for the big important dinners when you use the good china.\u201d These are large special-occasion items, the sort that might be seen in a heritage museum if they were old, showing how things were done back then. But it\u2019s really up to the couple how they want to decorate for their big important dinners, if they even have them. And if they don\u2019t feel super close to OP \u2014 and it certainly doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s much direct communication \u2014 then the \u201cOP made this for us\u201d effect doesn\u2019t get them attached either. The value in an heirloom is significantly based on sentimental connection rather than quality.", "Haha, ask The Google about a crochet museum.", "Exactly - everyone here mixing up cost and value.", "It all depends on the work she has done. Pls don\u2019t undervalue anyone without knowing what they have done esp since you say you aware of the art.", ">>she\u2019s martyring herself\u2026\n\n\nWon\u2019t argue with that. But calling something handmade junk to the maker, who is in your family, is trashy. Even if it doesn\u2019t fit your ~aesthetics~. Just say thank you and quietly repurpose it.", "Yeah sorry if she actually sent a message referring to the gift as Handmade junk then that is pretty clear cut rude. I'd say the baby gift could potentially (if we're being kind) be a casualty of the stress and chaos of having a newborn, but it could also be meant as a snub.", "I don't think that's true. I think sometimes you need to get things out and it's better to do it behind someone's back when they'll never find out than to their face.", "But then why not say just say heirloom which is already existing terminology? Because she is trying to falsely elevate herself into a category above all others. \n\nNotice how it's \"people who have seen her work\" saying it's good, and not any competition judges? How the hell can you say it's \"museum quality\" if it's not even state fair quality?", "Surely you don't mean the \"World Famous Crochet Museum\" located in Joshua Tree Park, which consists of a neon green shack on the side of the road? What a prestigious honor.", "Babies are stressful. But that response to the gift was pretty gross. It\u2019s easy to just say thank you and put it away. Getting clothes you don\u2019t like isn\u2019t that unusual an experience. \n\nAlso I do take OP\u2019s point that the family has asked her for things, that these items would sell for a very high price point and that her BILs might expect them. So it\u2019s not all ego at play with the question of not giving them as gifts because this SIL is being so obnoxious about it.", "Your comment caused me to choke a large gulp of coffee all over my keyboard.   My legal department will be contacting you vis a vis replacement of said keyboard--though we'd be willing to settle out of court for a museum quality crocheted keyboard cover."]}
