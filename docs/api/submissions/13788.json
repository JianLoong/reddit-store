People who have seen my work say it\u2019s heirloom/museum quality, so I\u2019m not just going off my own opinion that it's good.\n\nMy husband, John (47M) (names are fake), & I\u2019ve been married for 17+ yrs (together \\~5 more before that). John is the oldest, then John's sister, Samantha (46); then their much-younger half-brothers, Rob (38) & Seth (36). Thus, I have considered Rob & Seth \u2018family\u2019 since they were kids.\n\nI often crochet for family. Samantha asked me to make a beach cover-up; MIL asked for a sweater; they've each received afghans & scarves; 1 cousin got a baby afghan, another a set of placemats, etc. All of those items were well received. Also, John has several scarves & we have afghans all over the house.\n\nEverything was fine, until Rob married Joanne \\~3 years ago. John & I bought them 2 things off their registry at \\~$25. I also got them a set of napkin rings, & made them a matching set of 8 coasters, 8 napkins & a tablecloth. Between store-bought items/materials purchased/time invested, I\u2019d value the whole gift at over $5K. John & I got a note signed by just Rob, thanking us for \"the gift.\" Joanne didn't like the crocheted items - they weren't store-bought, & didn't \"fit her aesthetic.\" \n\nRob & Joanne had a baby boy, Charlie, \\~1 year later. For the shower, I made 2 baby afghans. I wasn't able to attend due to cancer/chemo (I'm in remission now), but sent the gift via MIL. Never got so much as a \u2018thank you\u2019. \n\nI saw, \\~3 mos after Charlie was born, a cute pattern for a baby's sweater/hoodie; I had some extra red & green yarn, so I made it for Charlie, again, sending it via MIL who was babysitting. Joanne sent a message back via MIL: \"Thanks, but I'm not exposing Charlie to bright colors, so if you send any more hand-made junk for him, could it at least be in the muted colors that I prefer?\" \n\nSeth & Diana are engaged & the wedding\u2019s in July. I was planning on, again, buying a couple of small things from the registry, but also making a tablecloth, with a different pattern, which is honestly much more intricate than the one I made for Rob & Joanne. I have quite a bit of it done. \n\nBut now I'm hearing from MIL & Samantha that the last time they babysat for Charlie, Diana & Joanne were complaining about the ornaments, laughing about the \"kitschy handmade crap\" I\u2019d made for Rob & Joanne\u2019s wedding & saying how Diana would likely get the same. The dictionary says \"kitsch\" is \"art in poor taste, yet with a certain ironic appeal.\" I don\u2019t think my work fits that, but far be it from me to force things on people who don't want/won't appreciate them.\n\nSo, WIBTA if, rather than giving Seth & Diana the tablecloth PLUS something small from the registry (a gift equivalent to what Rob & Diana got from us), we JUST buy something off the registry? And, since I\u2019ll finish it anyway, give the tablecloth to my best friend, instead? Honestly, I\u2019ll probably cave, because I do love Seth, it\u2019s partly for him, & Diana's comments aren't his fault.

It doesn't matter if your crochet items are museum quality or cost a lot - they don't like crochet. So constantly being gifted something they don't like when you know they don't like it makes YTA too.\n\nUse your crochet talents for people who love it, take the hint and start gifting them things they want. And in the meantime they should apologize for being rude.

Yes, these people are incredibly rude but saying this as a knitter, giving people things they don't like simply because you like to make them is also rude (not AH level but a bit of tunnel vision). Keep in mind who the gift is for,your SIL and MIL asked you to make them things. I am guessing your husband's half-brothers and their wives have never asked for anything nor complimented your items. If it's not their aesthetic don't force it on them.", "NTA but may I respectfully say that not everyone likes crochet? Yes your in laws are being unnecessarily rude but it sounds like you kept on giving them gifts expecting a different reaction (ie a more thoughtful thank you note).\n\nI say this as someone with many aunties who do crochet to museum quality. They always give me the most elaborate items, that inevitably end up in a cupboard as I just can't 'appreciate' them. They know I don't really like them and don't use them at home, still I keep on receiving this stuff in the hope that I will learn to value this craft or art as they call it.

Where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s actually bad form to gift something not from the registry unless it was discussed/approved before. \n\nFor example, before gifting a hand-made something, it would be expected that a convo took place so that everyone knows about and is good with it. (Maybe not the what but the colors. Or maybe the what but not the colors. This allows for some surprise but also ensures that the gift is welcome and appreciated.)\n\nYou have done a lot of work, & I don\u2019t want to discount that. It\u2019s very sweet.

Save your art (& such thoughtfulness) for people who do appreciate it.", "A very gentle YTA. You need to change your perspective on gift giving. People have different tastes and styles, and the purpose of a gift is to bring joy to the person receiving it. I, for example, have zero crochet items in my home and believe me, it's no accident. If a new in-law were to completely ignore my own tastes and suddenly start gifting me crochet pieces that change a room it would tell me that they have zero interest in who I am or what I like. Your relatives should have found a polite way to express that they don't want such gifts but please stop what you're doing and stick to the registry.", "ESH. They obviously don't like the crotcheted gifts and they TOLD you so - however rudely. \n\nWhy are you still gifting them stuff you know they don't like?", "People have registries for the sole purpose of letting other people know what they want / need.

They don't appreciate it so your efforts are wasted. You are probably feeling bad because that's how you *give* love to those around you.

Is there gold in them?", "NAH.  I quite frankly don\u2019t understand why you have continued to do this when you\u2019ve probably already gotten the vibe they are not cherished.  Example, did you see the tablecloths etc used/ displayed.   Did you always use colors that don\u2019t match their home?  \n\nThey were rude to say what they said BUT you were not present.   I think other SIL and MIL , in outing the others, MAY have been trying to tell you stop putting so much effort into something that isn\u2019t appreciated by throwing the \u2018married in\u2019 SILs under the bus.", "Save your handmade crafts for someone who clearly will appreciate.  Everyone has different style and if they don't like it they will not use it so it's actually a waste of your time and energy.\nThey are pretty rude to comment your crafts like that, but just a reminder the best gift is something people really want not what you can do best or what you think they might need.\nJust pick something from registry and give the tablecloths to someone who will cry happy tears receiving them.", "YTA for giving people handmade gifts when they have clearly expressed that they don't want them. Why would you want to waste your time and effort like that?", "I cannot believe this woman is \"not exposing\" her kid to bright colours. Does she buy exclusively from those catalogues that lady on Insta (or Tiktok or whatever) makes fun of in a fake Werner Herzog accent? \n\nAnyway NTA I just wanted to comment that that's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard and I hope this kid rebels against his mom's incredibly boring aesthetic by insisting on a neon mohawk hairstyle as a teen.", "YWNBTA. While I would personally be trilled to receive something hand made with love, it sounds like they would not be as grateful. At this point, I would say don't volunteer any more of your time for those ingrates. If you wanted to get them a slightly larger gift from their registry, I would understand, but don't feel obligated. Plus, I suspect that if you did, Samantha would complain that you spent more on them  \n\n\nIf Seth feels left out, feel free to explain to him how you felt the gift would be unwanted due to Diana's comments with Samantha. Heck, you could even hold off on giving it to a friend so that if something is said you can say 'well, it's here if you want it'", "Guess what someone people think crochet are ugly. Very ugly. I would never use anything  crochet in my house cause it's not my cup of tea. So stick with the registry. I have a feeling someone of your family and friends are just being nice to about it.", "NTA.

They don't deserve anything handmade.\n\nI have a full sized crocheted bedspread my mom made; she made my sisters and I the same one in different colors.

She had to hustle to make the second one when auntie learned she was having twins.", "NTA. Don't make it for people who are rude like that. Buy off their registry. If your BIL ask, make something for them if they want but specify, it's for them.", "NTA. But before you decide not to give the home made stuff I would suggest speaking to BIL. He may like it or he can chat to fiancee about it. But moving forward I would only make things for people who appreciate them", "I think you should approach them directly and say that given Joanne's reaction to the handmade things you've given her, you want to check beforehand if they'd like handmade goods. If they say no, just take them off the list.", "YWNBTA but I think the best solution would be to talk directly to them about it and explain that you were planning on making them x item but you had heard that it wasn't really their aesthetic and wouldn't like to gift them something that wouldn't be used (try to do this in a non-accusatory manner). Then you'll be able to explain that it's not due to a difference in the amount that you care about your BiL's but that you just want to make sure that the gift is something they actually want. That way the ball is in their court.", "NTA. I crochet and knit, so I know how much work goes into an item. BUT I also know that presents should be with the person who gets them in mind and so I never make anything unless: specifically requested or I know the person getting them would love it because of how they comment on anything else I made or something like that. \nWe all love our craftwork, but tastes vary and it\u2019s easier for everyone to go with what a couple wants (that\u2019s what the registry is for) than spend hours of labour on something that will not be loved.", "NTA", "since they dont appreciate the thought and time that went into your work then u just buy them one fork and one knife and u know what they can do with it.   they dont appreciate and realize your leaving a beautiful legacy of love behind in making those things to remember u by one day.", "YWNBTA. Joanne knows exactly what she\u2019s doing with the comments and she sounds rude as hell.

Whether OP knew from direct contact about things or through more tactful passing of thr info from their other relatives; OP knew the items being made were not the style of the recipient/s or didnt fit their needs (could be for example that they dont have a glass top to put over their table to keep the crochet flat and allow cleaning, and with small kids it would be impossible to not have it filled with crumbs and covered in stains... I would say it obviously wouldn't suit any more than a thin pillar with a priceless vase sitting precariously on top would suit the entryway to their home.\n\nI do see your point about the value to buyers or sellers, and don't disagree, but ultimately this is a gift OP knows the recipient won't like and isn't to their taste for decor (they're a couple and share a home so one no is all that's needed to veto, two yes answers are required generally).\n\nSomeone else said it better elsewhere, it's like getting someone a gift relating to your hobby that they don't share. If they didnt like consoles or gaming, getting someone a PS5 as a gift would be equally poorly recieved, much as its generous and widely considered a good gift, the recipient is the person(s) whose opinion on the item/s really matters.\n\n\nAlso, while I still agree OP undersold the pricing for time. I would imagine they weren't at top speed while ill, and also that it's unlikely that the blanket and place settings took 2190/2738 total hours of labour, no matter how intricate the pattern, assuming their experience means they're as speedy at crocheting as most folk who have been doing it long enough to be proficient/skilled.\n\nNo shade if OP has dexterity issues or something and it takes them longer than others, it just means they should be more careful when choosing to dedicate that limited time and ability to making a gift for someone. They should be sure that it is something that would be appreciated as an item outside the attached cost of labour hours, materials, and difficulty/quality. From a receiver perspective, as well as not liking the item, they may also feel bad that OP dedicated that time to making an item they knew wouldnt be enjoyed while they should have been recovering.\n\n\nTo me, a good gift doesnt come with an expectation that the reciever should appreciate things by proxy, when they mean a lot to the giver. I always go for what someone wants/needs and/or something they consume generally themselves, and these are always well received. Here, they've the added bonus of having had access to a wedding registry where the couple have put items they want/need and would like to recieve as a gift, if they would be equally happy and thankful if everyone ignored that and gave them tablecloths they wont use, it sort of defeats the purpose of a registry altogether.", "I think it's bizarre that you're spending SO much time making something that won't be valued.

I would absolutely not value that gift as a $5k gift to me, it would feel like a burden. Now, I would still thank the gift giver, but there's a huge discrepancy in the value.

Between store-bought items/materials purchased/time invested, I\u2019d value the whole gift at over $5K. John & I got a note signed by just Rob, thanking us for \"the gift.\" Joanne didn't like the crocheted items - they weren't store-bought, & didn't \"fit her aesthetic.\"\"\n\nJoanne made it clear she did not like the gifts. She's rude and problematic, but it seems almost passive aggressive that you then kept on gifting her more crocheted things. She tried speaking to you about it, not saying thank you, directly asserting her preferences. Etc. The woman could not be any clearer about the fact that she does not want or appreciate your crocheted gifts.\n\nTruthfully, as someone around her age, I also wouldn't really want the gifts you're giving. I knit myself and would appreciate the work you put into it/ be much more polite about it. But crocheted table clothes are the kind of gifts you have to store when most people don't have much space these days, pull out and make match your style when hosting the gift giver, put extra time into cleaning, etc.\n\nShe made it clear, after the wedding, that she's not the type of person you should give such gifts to.\n\nAt this point, are you really surprised that Joanne is laughing at the unwanted gift that keeps arriving despite her making it very clear she doesn't want it to the point of being rude about it? This almost reads like you made her an elaborate gift, she told you she did not want anymore, and then you kept sending her more as punishment. Which is absurd when you have other people in your life who would appreciate your time and efforts. \n\nThe thing is, we don't know if Diana would appreciate the gift or hates the idea. Joanne could have been the clear instigator/ one laughing about it and Diana could have just been politely listening/ agreeing (because she's marrying into a family where Joanne is about to be her SIL) or Diana could be absolutely making fun of you and unable to appreciate what you are gifting. Either way, it is absurd that you kept sending more crocheted things after being told it was unwanted and I'm not surprised they find that a bit funny.\n\nHave you considered just asking Diana and Seth? You can say, \"I've crocheted things for all the weddings and family events thus far and have been told that, for the most part, they are appreciated. However, I get that it is not everyone's style and would rather gift things to people who appreciate them and recognize the quality.

They have a registry. While I understand you like to crochet, you are giving them stuff they don't want. You are forcing YOUR personal tastes on them. They are clearly polite enough to not say anything to your face, but I can see where they would make a comment to their MIL every time they get gifts they did not ask for or like. The POLITE thing to do would be to ask them in advance if they would like your homemade gifts and inquire about colors.\n\nI personally love handmade craft gifts, I do, but a part of it is knowing your recipient.

I\u2019ve made tons and tons of home items or stuffed animals for some friends while other friends I care about just as much don\u2019t get those items because they wouldn\u2019t like them or use them, and a gift is supposed to be about the person receiving it.

Would this be something they would use? What colors do they prefer? Pattern preference from a few that are on my skill level? Allergies to certain fibers?\n\nSome people (they are my favorite)  will give me free reign to choose,  & I can learn new stitches, try new color combos,  or attempt to make things I've never made before,  which is super fun.

Suggesting that they shouldn\u2019t count time as all since they watch TV during it.  That devalues ALL crochet work, not just saying that this person is being unreasonable.  If you don\u2019t want to pay $300 for a handmade crochet sweater that\u2019s fine, but saying it\u2019s ridiculous to charge that much ignores the work that goes into crochet projects.", "I'm am not saying time spent does not have value, obviously OPs time has value, but the value OP places on their time is not the same value that others have to place on it. \nArts/crafts are subjective. \n\nI am not saying it is ridiculous to to charge $x amount, what I consider a bit unrealistic (not unreasonable) is to place $x value on something that OP has not actually sold. \n\nIf I make a painting and spend a ton of time on it and give it to someone as a goft I could say it is worth $1 million, but unless I am actively selling and people are buying my paintings for $1million it is unrealistic to say I have given someone a gift worth/valued at $1 million. \n\nI don't use tablecloths, if I did, I would not want a knit one that needs special care in washing and handling. I would never pay $3-4k for a tablecloth or for other pieces or art. Even if the artist spent a lot of time on it. \n\nSo while I would appreciate the time someone spent making it, it would not have a value of $3-4k to me. \n\nAlso while I'm sure OP is very talented, and people appreciate her time/effort, I do wonder if OP has actually sold any items for anywhere near that cost? If OP asked friends/family who really enjoyed/appreciated her crotchet work, I would venture to guess no one would be willing to pay $3-4k for their items. \n\nSimilar to when a friend had extra concert tix. If it is s band I don't know or know we'll, if they ask me to pay $40/50 for an extra tix I am going to take a pass, if they offer the Tix for free sure I will go and enjoy the concert."]}
