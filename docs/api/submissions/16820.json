She claims she's been able to make a living doing that but I've never seen her business accounts so I can't confirm nor deny. She lives alone so unless her parents are helping her (her parents are dirt poor though) she must at least make a minimum wage.\n\nI never questioned her life choices although I found them odd. What's the point of getting degrees but not using them for anything is beyond me. \n\nI met Ruby for coffee on bank holiday Monday and we were chatting. I complained about work, that I was overlooked for promotion again. She sympathised. But when I asked her what's new about her work, she perked up. Honestly, I kind of expected her to keep her success on the downlow considering that I was down regarding my job but she didn't hold back. Apaprently, she's just finished editing her book (i had no idea she was writing one) and she sent it to an editor for edits before quering. And she's about to launch her true crime youtube channel because she's been filming videos for the past few months so she has a few months prerecorded.\nTo say that my jaw dropped would be an understatement. This is a woman in her 30s who's still playing around like a child. No real responsibilities, jumping from one thing to another without a care in the world.\n\nI care about her so I thought someone had to say it. I asked her when she was planning on getting a real job.\n\"What do you mean,\" she asked me.\nI explained to her that I thought it was the right time to get a real job as she can't play all her life and it'll come back to bite her when she's older and needs some professional experience when her little ventures fail.\n\nShe got really offended and told me she never expected me to say this and thought I was supportive but I was like the other people who belittled her accomplishements.\nI said I was nothing like them and I wasn't belittling them but recording a few videos and make a few candles wasn't that big of an accomplishement and that with her intelligence she was selling herself short when she could be really accomplished if she only worked in her profession.\n\nShe told me to fuck off and left the lunch.\nI thought she'd call apologising but no luck. My husband told me I was the asshole because she's my friend and even if I didn't like it, I should've played along but I don't know if I agree with him. Real friends tell the truth and I couldn't just coddle her, she needed someone to show her that she's wasting her time.\nShe still hasn't called and I am starting to worry, perhaps, they're right and I should've kept my mouth shut for the sake of our friendship.

You resent her for her happiness and attempt to drag her into the misery that is the working world. That's not friendship.", "YTA.\n\nYour attitude toward your friend is condescending and contemptuous. If she's making money, it's none of your business whether it's \"childish\" or not. People can be very successful that way. I suspect she will be one of those successful people, and I suspect you're jealous. She's not going to apologize; YOU are the biggest asshole in the room.", "YTA for how judgy you sound. Also, saying 'I'm not belittling you but your accomplishments are not that important' is only fooling yourself. That is belittling someone who is supposed to be your friend and you sound bitter and jealous.\n\nEdit: a word", "YTA. Why would she apologize to you? You are the one that insulted her life, she didn't insult yours. You don't know her finances, maybe she is wealthly via parents, what does that matter.

Your prejudice about what is and isn't a real job is full of crap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm willing to bet at some point Bill Gates was told to get a real job and stop messing with those computer thingys.

And FYI, making and selling soaps and candles, IS a real business.", "YTA \n\nI dunno how you can call Ruby your friend when you treat her like this.  You got upset that she was doing better in life right now and you lashed out by belittled her pursuits as \"being a child\".  When you tell her that what she's choosing to do is \"playing around like a child\" YOU ARE BELITTLING HER.  \n\nI dunno what hole you crawled out of OP but podcasts, videomaking, and running your own business is something a lot of adults do in our century.  Most of these brands you see on the shelf of stores now came from folks who started their own business.  Just because her jobs don't fall into your narrow definition of what \"being an adult is\" doesn't mean you can put her down for it.

She should not need to show her TRUE friends her bank statements to prove she's worthy of their support.\n\nAnd let's be clear: You're not happy at your job. Because most \"real jobs\" these days are crap. And anyone who can support themselves without being subjected to the demeaning and dehumanizing culture that is the modern job market--that person is my hero.\n\nAlso, I don't ever want my friends to downplay their own success and happiness just because my life isn't going how I want it to go at the moment. No matter how disappointed I may be in my own circumstances, I always want to celebrate my friends' accomplishments and good fortune. Yet you want your friend to keep her \"success on the downlow\" for your comfort. I'm so glad to not count you among my friends. I don't need that BS in my life. And neither does she.", "Yta. Do I really need to tell you why??", "YTA -  Being a maker is a \u2018real\u2019 job. Plenty of people work in a more traditional career and are miserable so they make a conscious decision to change paths. It sounds like that\u2019s what she did and you\u2019re telling her all of her hard work is going to fail when she\u2019s very obviously making it work. You\u2019re not seriously surprised she got offended are you?", "So you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re an asshole for telling your friend that all of her life choices suck and everything she is working on is going to fail?\n\nHmm, that\u2019s a tough one.\n\nYTA, I guess. I mean obviously it could go either way here /s", "YTA obviously she's making a living doing what she's doing and you're jealous. It's so weird that I'm older than you but you're the boomer lol. People can and do make a living doing these things. They're much more \"real\" jobs than whatever 9-5 you're doing if we're dock measuring on Capitalism. These are start up businesses that could fail at any time. They also have the potential to really make it big. Your \"real job\" will pay the same now as it will 10 years from now and if you're lucky you might get raises that match inflation but probably won't.  \n\n\nAnd let's say even if you're world view was right. You're still an asshole for shutting down her happiness. Why does everyone feel entitled and compelled to put others down? (Ironic I guess while typing this out). But at least you asked me. Did she ask you what you thought of her job or were you just butting your opinion in where it wasn't wanted?", "YTA- And a big one too! Not everyone is going to have an office job 9-5, pencil pushing. She's doing things she's passionate about and she must be doing well for herself if she can pay all of her bills and still have free time. Why are you so judgmental and entitled? \"Real friends\" support each other so if you actually care about her you'd apologize to her.", "YTA.\n\nsome people settle into a career and need that stability and never stray, and some people have a more entrepreneurial spirit that takes them from passion to passion. \n\nyou don't get to judge someone just because they don't want to live the same kind of life you do. she's not asking you for anything, she's perfectly self-sufficient and is apparently really excited about what she's been doing. how many people are lucky enough to say the same?", "IN FO: When are YOU going to get a real job? With your intelligence you're obviously selling yourself short playing around like you've been for all these years.\n\nJust kidding, YTA. She seems to be doing well enough, she's not asking you for money, you just decided you were better than her without having a clue what things are like for her. That's kind of the definition of \"asshole\".", "YTA. She's supporting herself doing what she enjoys. She isn't hurting anyone by having a non-conventional career.\n\nIt sounds like you resent her for pursuing her own happiness rather than immiserating herself in the pursuit of empty status and an ever increasing amount of money like you did.", "YTA.\n\nI mean, you said that you care about her and that's fine but it's her choice at the end of the day. It's not up to you to decide what your friend should do with her own life, especially if she appears to be happy and stabilized and pays her own bills without asking you for anything.\n\nYou discredited your friend's work and that's not being a good friend at all. And if that's what your friend wants to do professionally, you should support and encourage her, not put her down.\n\n\rI don't know if I'm reading the situation well but it seems to me that maybe you're a little jealous of your friend's courage to pursue her dreams and that she's succeeding doing what she really likes.   \n\n\n(\"I explained to her that I thought it was the right time to get a real job as she can't play all her life and it'll come back to bite her when she's older and needs some professional experience when her little ventures fail.\")\n\nWhy do you immediately assume that she will fail? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA!!!!!", "Yep HUGE YTA, just because you stuck to traditional 9-5 job and feel overwhelmed and stressed about your life doesn\u2019t mean that everyone should. Sometimes people pursue higher education and degree to open multiple paths for them.\n\nShe is pursuing what she loves and just because you are unhappy with your life and jealous of her perkiness doesn\u2019t mean she is doing it wrong, she is taking more risks and could easily get more gains and better rewards than you FYI.\n\nAlso, real friends aren\u2019t judgemental and so closed minded. If you don\u2019t know her financial statement, you have no right to question it. It\u2019s her life and her choice, she is focussing on her passions and making a living out of it.", "YTA. Not everyone\u2019s work looks the same and what difference does it make to you if her work doesn\u2019t fit a particular mold?

How do her decisions impact you? She\u2019s able to afford her bills and is happy in her situation. Not everyone feels the need to live to work. Your friend sounds content and happy with her life, whereas you don\u2019t.

I hope your friend is able to find a more supportive circle of people. \n\nShe doesn't have to abide by your metrics of success and adulthood.

It's sad you took out your frustrations on her instead of just supporting your friend.", "Wow. YTA. Your idea of what is a \"real job\" is just your opinion. Frankly, you sound jealous of her ability to live her life doing stuff she likes. You don't sound like a good friend.", "YTA absolutely and ruby\u2019s doing better in life than you are by the sounds of it. What an asshole move to downgrade her accomplishments and ask something like you did. Then to expect her to apologize??? No f***ing way! Tou owe her an apology.

You have admitted that she's making enough money to live by herself meaning she's doing great. YT can be a proper job to those who use it with the intention of profit. Being an Author is also a real job. \n\nYour friend might have gotten a degree but that doesn't mean she has to use it. You sound judgemental and incredibly jealous. You're going around calling her kid when in fact her career has moved on.\n\nYTA\n\nYou need to grow up.", "YTA - your definition of a \"real job\" is different from the universally accepted definition of a \"job\", which is a task you complete in exchange for money. \n\nPeople make their way in all kinds of fashions now. Just because someone's chosen path misaligns with your own does not automatically make it less than or a bad path.

Started her own small business, which sounds like it is successful.\n2. Written a book.\n3.

You don\u2019t have to agree with someone\u2019s life choices, but you could certainly be supportive.

From the beginning of your post until the end you were judging her choices because they weren't the ones *you* made. \n\nShe has a business which is making money whether you think it's a real job or not. If she wants to make videos & write books then that's all right, too. As long as she's able to live & not asking you for money, then it's none of your business. \n\nThe only one who needs to apologize is *you* for your bad behavior.

You, on the other hand, are complaining about being overlooked for another promotion.  You sound jealous and you are kidding yourself if you think she owes you an apology.

You don\u2019t have to work in the field in which your degree is in to be successful.", "YTA what she's doing is far more demanding than turning up to be a desk jockey day in and day out.\n\nIf she's your friend you should be celebrating that all the way!", "HAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nI mean, obviously YTA, but also thank you. Your complete lack of self-awareness was the best laugh I've had in ages. I mean, you just publicly and without prompting admitted to thousands of people that:\n\n\\- Your friend just keeps being wildly successful at everything she does in multiple, unrelated fields, despite having taken the huge risk of setting off on her own as an entrepreneur outside of her field of academic training, whilst\n\n\\- You are miserably unsuccessful, working for someone else in the are for which you trained and were educated, and not only haven't accomplished anything at all of note, you aren't even good enough at your job to live up to your boss's expectations, so that you've been REPEATEDLY passed over for promotion.\n\nThen, having considered (or perhaps I should say NOT having even the basic common sense to have considered) these facts, you still somehow came to the utterly inane conclusion that YOU ought to be giving HER advice; and the advice that you gave her was that she should, um . . . stop doing all of the things that she is doing that are having so much success, because you (again, the person who has had literally *no forward professional momentum whatsoever*) don't think much of them, and should instead try to follow a similar career path to your wildly unsuccessful one. \n\nI feel like I want you to see the irony here, but you're definitely not going to. \n\nSo here it is plainly: YTA. Your friend has been exponentially more professionally successful than you have, by every measure. You giving her professional advice is ridiculous on the face of it. You belittling her career path doesn't come off as wise or sagely helpful, or whatever you had it as in your head; it just sounds pompous, childishly petulant, and reeking of exactly the inflexible, self-important mindset that has likely kept your own career from advancing.\n\nOn top of which, you were just incredibly rude. \n\nBut again, thank you for the laughs.", "Yta. If she's happy and surviving let her get on with it. Most millionaires didn't to \"proper\" nine to fives", "Another jealous friend post.

You just seem to be jealous.", "YTA. Get real, OP. You didn't \"ask\" her when she was getting a \"real\" job because you wanted to know. You were being indirectly insulting.

So do it.", "YTA for so many things in this, I don\u2019t know where to start.\nSomeone needs to show your their business ledger just for you to believe they\u2019re doing well?

Is no one allowed to enjoy their work because you don\u2019t?\nIf you don\u2019t think telling someone that what they do for a living, especially if it makes them happy and keeps a roof over their head and food on their table, is playing and not a real job isn\u2019t condescending or belittling them, then you are just a clueless a$$ and someone I would not want to be friends with.", "NAH - I think you do need to reflect though. You obviously don't know a lot about how her life is going. \n\nI have a buddy like Ruby, who has done nothing but waste money his entire 20's. He's got no savings, no education, no skills besides motorcycle mechanics. He pissed away an insanely cushy deal that sounded like a motorcycle guys dream, he was in charge of maintaining a guys private collection. He always has \"something\" going on, but he still lives at his parents house at 29. I'm hoping this is his last round of college and he can commit to actually following through, because I'm his friend and want him to succeed in life and not be broke/destitute. I have a hard boundary that I will help him move, just not into my house. \n\nSo for Ruby, you do need to apologize. And you do need to withhold judgement in your own life as long as her needs are met. But you are right, if everything she's talking about is just \"fluff\" made up to save face with people around her, that's a whole other issue. \"sent a book to an editor\" is not \"book about to be published\", it means you sent it in for edits. Everyone with the strict YTA votes is missing that nuance in your post, IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW WITH THIS LADY, NOTHING HAS EVER TAKEN OFF, IT'S JUST ALWAYS \"in the works\". So I get why OP is so disdainful, because I've heard this song and dance before.", "NTA..maybe\u2026I\u2019ve got a couple decades on you.  Your intent is correct.

I agree it sounds like your friend needs some direction\u2026and I agree when your friend gets old and has nothing (in the way of savings/retirement) they will be in a wold of hurt and mad at themself.   Peter Pan is never happy with their choices when they are 65yo & broke.   You have appropriate concern for your friend\u2026but you need to frame it in a more loving way.

She claims she's been able to make a living doing that but I've never seen her business accounts so I can't confirm nor deny. She lives alone so unless her parents are helping her (her parents are dirt poor though) she must at least make a minimum wage.\n\nI never questioned her life choices although I found them odd. What's the point of getting degrees but not using them for anything is beyond me. \n\nI met Ruby for coffee on bank holiday Monday and we were chatting. I complained about work, that I was overlooked for promotion again. She sympathised. But when I asked her what's new about her work, she perked up. Honestly, I kind of expected her to keep her success on the downlow considering that I was down regarding my job but she didn't hold back. Apaprently, she's just finished editing her book (i had no idea she was writing one) and she sent it to an editor for edits before quering. And she's about to launch her true crime youtube channel because she's been filming videos for the past few months so she has a few months prerecorded.\nTo say that my jaw dropped would be an understatement. This is a woman in her 30s who's still playing around like a child. No real responsibilities, jumping from one thing to another without a care in the world.\n\nI care about her so I thought someone had to say it. I asked her when she was planning on getting a real job.\n\"What do you mean,\" she asked me.\nI explained to her that I thought it was the right time to get a real job as she can't play all her life and it'll come back to bite her when she's older and needs some professional experience when her little ventures fail.\nShe got really offended and told me she never expected me to say this and thought I was supportive but I was like the other people who belittled her accomplishements.\nI said I was nothing like them and I wasn't belittling them but recording a few videos and make a few candles wasn't that big of an accomplishement and that with her intelligence she was selling herself short when she could be really accomplished if she only worked in her profession.\nShe told me to fuck off and left the lunch.\nI thought she'd call apologising but no luck. My husband told me I was the asshole because she's my friend and even if I didn't like it, I should've played along but I don't know if I agree with him. Real friends tell the truth and I couldn't just coddle her, she needed someone to show her that she's wasting her time.\nShe still hasn't called and I am starting to worry, perhaps, they're right and I should've kept my mouth shut for the sake of our friendship. AITA for asking her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Which makes it absolutely not your business no matter how long you've been friends. (By the way, this snobby attitude might play into why you're being passed over for promotion.) Instead of being happy for her you put her down in a really offensive way. You're the one who should be apologizing, but I wouldn't be surprised if you just permanently broke your friendship.", "YTA. I hate to drop the real world on you, but your friend understands how the new economy works.  You need to catch up or get left in the dust.", "YTA you were clearly lashing out and punishing her because she didn't downplay her success for the sake of your feelings.

Just because what she\u2019s doing doesn\u2019t fit into what you think a career should look like doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s doing anything wrong. Had she been asking you to financially support her, sure, I could see your point of view. But seeing as you weren\u2019t even aware of all her projects, it sounds like she hasn\u2019t needed your support. And since you don\u2019t support her career choices or carefree lifestyle, it sounds like she also may not need you as a friend.\n\nMaybe you couldn\u2019t make that kind of lifestyle work for you (I don\u2019t think I could either - this isn\u2019t a slam on you) but those who can and use that success to plan for the future can have quite lucrative careers and lives.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s owed an apology, it\u2019s your friend.", "YTA.

I am miserable in my job and jealous, and the only way I feel able to express it is to insult her chosen occupation. If I can't be happy, why does she get to be?\"\n\nThe needed reality check is the one you need - your college degree doesn't have to dictate your life.

If you hate your job, try to pursue a different career. **There is nothing wrong with those things.**\n\nYTA", "YTA. She\u2019s obviously been hiding things from you for a reason. She sounds like she has a few successful avenues and things are working out. Just because people don\u2019t have the traditional 9-5 doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re being children. YOU ARE A CHILD OP. Grow up and be supportive of your friends because you sound bitter. This is absolutely ridiculous", "Your just jealous. YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re being extremely condescending, seemingly because your friend is happy with her atypical career path.\n\n\nFirst of all, you seem to have expected your friend to hold back from sharing her successes, simply because you didn\u2019t meet your own career goal. Dulling other people\u2019s shine to make yourself feel better is sad, at best, and cruel, at worst. You asked your friend about how her career is going and got an honest answer. Instead of being happy for her, you\u2019ve tried to bring her down to wallow disappointment. Be happy for your friends! Life isn\u2019t a competition.\n\n\nNext, you\u2019re insulting your friend, a small business owner looking to expand her portfolio with other venues, by minimising her successes, simply because they\u2019re creative endeavours rather than white-collar jobs. Ignoring the classist implications of this, it seems you don\u2019t understand that someone can be accomplished despite building a business from scratch, simply because it\u2019s creative.\n\n\nUltimately, I don\u2019t understand why you would treat a friend like this. You say that it\u2019s out of concern, but let\u2019s be real, hiring managers adore successful entrepreneurs - there\u2019s no indication that your friend is anything but successful. Whilst you may not be consciously jealous of your mate, it may be worth thinking about why you found it so pertinent to bring her down and challenge some of your own stereotypes about self-employed people and those in creative industries.

But that is not her problem, you should not be putting up feelings on her. Because that's exactly what your entire post drips up, is jealousy and disdain. Third of all, expecting her to apologize for your rude comments is awfully entitled and disgusting behavior. I wouldn't apologize to you, if anything I would expect you to apologize to me or the friendship would be over. You had absolutely no rights to say those things to her. None whatsoever.
