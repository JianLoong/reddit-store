Is this really how they treat their guests? By waking them up in the middle of the night and keeping them awake/annoying them for an hour every night? Terrible manners. \n\nI would apologize but tell them that this is unacceptable. You were sleeping. How would they like it of someone kept waking them up watching tv and singing loudly in the middle of the night? This is extremely poor manners. Especially since you are \"just a guest\".", "ESH. She should\u2019ve clearly seen you were trying to sleep singing loudly like that is rude asl. At the same time you couldve easily asked her to stop or to quiet down rather than yell at her.

She sucks bc what an asshole! I would just stop making a point of visiting them.", "Absolutely NTA. She should\u2019ve worked to find you a different spot to sleep in or simply refrained from her routine for a few days while you\u2019re there. It\u2019s so rude to wake a guest like that, family or not.", "Hell no your mum is being absolutely obnoxious \ud83d\ude12 who acts like that when someone is trying to sleep?! \n\nNTA", "Your mom's so rude!! Time to stop the sleepovers already.\n\nNTA.", "INFO: is there a reason why your mother might think you could sleep through all that disturbance? Because it seems like odd behaviour on her part. In my family saying 'shut up' to a parent would be deeply shocking, but it would have been very reasonable to say to her that you can't sleep, and that you understand if she needs to use the living room but then is there a different room you can sleep in?\n\nAnd if they can't work out a better sleeping situation for you, in future I would consider not staying with them, but just calling by to visit or for lunch or something. If they query why your visits have got shorter, you can just say that you don't want to inconvenience them and you realise they don't have enough space to put you up.", "ESH You were rude to your mother but what kind of person deliberately makes noise when and where someone is trying to sleep? I'd stop visiting if I had to sleep on an air mattress for 2 weeks. Have dinner with them and then go to a hotel.", "INFO: (1) Is it possible your mother was sleepwalking?\n(2) Did you speak with her about her behaviour and how it was affecting you before snapping at her?", "NTA.  Who does this to their guest?  It\u2019s like she\u2019s passively and aggressively trying to tell you you\u2019re actually unwelcome.  I\u2019d ask about this upfront.  That kind of behavior makes no sense.", "Don't stay with them again.", "NTA,  that is not how you treat guests. I'd stop staying there when in their city.", "Are you sure they actually want you to stay at their place when visiting? This sounds like drive the guest away behaviour without having to tell the guest don\u2019t come again.", "It\u2019s definitely not too strong. His mum is being obnoxious and she knows it", "Snapping at someone that repeatedly disrespects you is not AH behaviour", "Oh I agree\u2026 didn\u2019t say it was too strong.  I\u2019d have followed it up with a \u201cwhat the hell are you DOING at 1am here singing at me?!\u201d LOL.", "Telling someone they're being rude and please stop is one thing. Telling your mother to shut up out of the blue is another. OP never said anything to mom about how annoyed she was beforehand. She only got mad because she couldn't find her head phones.", "I would\u2019ve asked her if she need to see a psychiatrist because her need to be the main character/ grab attention had reached such levels I was concerned for her.", "She needs an agent LOL\u2026 because the world revolves around her stardom!", "NTA,\n\nwho goes down at 1 am to have tea,blast headphones, lights on, tv on, singing when your child is sleeping near you... shut up is a bit harsh, you could've asked her to be quiet or just told her to stop.", "NTA\n\nIf they want to call you a guest instead of family, they can treat you like one. You don't wake guests every night at midnight and keep them up for an hour or more because you feel like it. What one arth was she thinking? Also, why is taking this treatment more important than allowing you to sleep? If I were you, I'd never sleep in their house again.\n\nEdit: to add. Sleep deprivation is a literal torture tactic. Why is she allowed to do this, but you telling her to stop is out of line? If they didn't want you in their house they could have just said so instead of playing this weird game.", "NTA. Telling someone in your family to shut up is not the end of the world. Yes, you could have more tact about it, she is your mom and it is their home, but under the circumstances you were pre-agitated so its quite normal.\n\nIt doesn't mean you cant apologise. An apology goes a long way, even if you weren't the only one being in the wrong. It sets the stage for a calmer conversation.\n\nJust have a conversation with her, say youre sorry and you were upset because those sleeping arrangements aren't working for you. Say you need some calm and privacy during nights when you stay over. If she cant sleep, she can do other quieter things when she has guests.", "NTA. That's really rude and obnoxious of your mom.", "Jeez - I am one of those that can never sleep - but I tiptoe around, making like a \"mouse in da house\". No noise, no direct lights, close kitchen door when I boil the kettle.... it's etiquette", "NTA. How would they like it if you decided to wander into their bedroom after midnight, turn on lights willy-nilly, and sit singing on their furniture while they're trying to sleep?   \nIf you're a guest in their home then you are entitled to the respect given to guests by hosts, which includes not being disturbed by off-key caterwauling and people trundling through your sleeping area with the lights on after midnight!", "ESH\n\nYou less so than her, but you did yourself and her a disservice by handling it this way. You should have spoken up WAY sooner, like the first time it happened. Then it could have just said, \u201cHey Mom, can you cut that out? I\u2019m trying to sleep here.\u201d \n\nAnd technically you still could have said it the same way, but I get that you were understandably frustrated and sleep deprived\u2026 Which you kinda did to yourself by letting her think it was ok", "ESH. Your mother should have been more considerate while you were sleeping on the couch.\n\nYou should learn to say, \"Mom, I can't sleep when you are walking around, turning on lights, watching tv and singing.\" \n\nTelling you mother to shut up is unacceptable. Use your big girl words. \n\nDo you have any siblings you could stay with when you come to town?", "YTA. You were disrespectful to your mother and it was unnecessary. Did you try talking to her about this?\n\nIt's hard to believe she wouldn't know how obnoxious she's being while you're trying to sleep, but if she was shocked then apparently it hasn't occurred to her.", "I wonder if your mom wants to spend some one-on-one time with you. That\u2019s the only way I can wrap my brain around why she would do that so intentionally.", "ESH", "No, YTA. That was incredibly rude and it's not your home anymore. You're visiting them and maybe that's your mother's routine? You also could have gone about it in a totally different way but you decided to act like an asshole.", "Your mom is definitely wrong for making a lot of noise when you\u2019re trying to sleep. However, consider yourself lucky that your dad didn\u2019t put you out of the house immediately.", "NTA. You were a guest, so your mom was a host. Her behavior at 1 a.m. was very, very inconsiderate. \n\nI know it is done and gone, but I wish you had gotten up the first night, talked to your mom AND told her how much you needed sleep... maybe she would decide to act differently.\n\nMy husband and I live in a smallish 2 bedroom now and when we have a guest(s), my life is very, very different. I tend to spend a lot of time in our guest room (hobbies, tv, stuff...). I am super happy to have guests, but it is a huge adjustment for me and my husband.\n\nYou were fine, your mom was inappropriate and she should have known that. Your dad was ... again inappropriate. Stay in hotels in the future.", "This is some of the most unhinged non violent/aggressive behavior I have read on here between a mom and daughter. How bizarre.", "I think its actually quite sweet for the dad to side with his wife. I mean, he was upset because his daughter made his wife cry. It doesn't mean he agrees that what his wife did was ok. Not enough husbands support their wives even when they are being unreasonable.", "What you're suggesting is a a pretty cowardly way to ask someone to leave. It could be right, but damn what a lack of selfrespect", "At midnight? While wearing headphones?", "Yeah, people tend to be rude when you wake them up singing at 1am!", "It's her fault she went into a room where a guest was sleeping at MIDNIGHT and turned the lights on and started singing!", "Unfortunately some people are that oblivious.", "Op is a female", "IKR? I had a mean mom but she never did that to me!", "This is just the tip of the iceberg, I'm betting.", "No. The wife's being unreasonable, he should be supporting his daughter."]}
