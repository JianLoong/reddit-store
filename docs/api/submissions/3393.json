I have long hair and put it up so it seems weird to me she has that much hair in food when cooking.", "NTA\n\nI dry heaved reading this.\n\nI have this issue with my daughter and her beautiful golden hair that looks way better on her head than in my pasta. I keep a small section of rope hanging on the wall by the entrance to the kitchen with a variety of hair clips and ties so that way every time we go in the kitchen there's something right there to tie up her hair. That helps her remember. \n\nJust... Ew, man I feel your pain.", "NTA this is soo gross on so many levels. My hair sheds as well, and the very first thing I do it put my hair back/up bc I would be mortified if someone found hair in their food. I don\u2019t understand why she hasn\u2019t taken the hint that it\u2019s disgusting. Hopefully she can listen to her parents and prevent it from happening again. \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA. You did what you could. Maybe she needed to hear it from someone other than you. If she persists in not wearing the hairnet, it seriously might be time for couples counseling because this is about as passive-aggressive as it gets.", "NTA \nI have hair down past my tailbone. I have ALWAYS  put my hair up in some fashion when in the kitchen and I am darn careful about where my hair ends up. Even after I get my hair ready for the day, I pull any excess off my clothes before I leave the bathroom! \nIs she brushing her hair in the kitchen or is she just losing hair that badly? If she is just losing hair left and right, she may need to make sure her thyroid is ok. Hormonal imbalances can cause hair loss. \nUltimately your wife is aware it's an issue, and it wasn't a big deal until this incident. Maybe the experience was enough to make her care a little more and be careful in the future.", "NTA but this so so weird. I don\u2019t understand why it isn\u2019t just natural for her to tie up her hair while cooking? If you have consistently found hair in food she cooks, that should be a major hint to her to tie up her hair.", "NTA.  That\u2019s just gross. You\u2019ve explained and she embarrassed herself on this one.", "NTA you tried to talk to her about it before, it's not your fault she didn't take you seriously until someone else brought it up. \n\nIt's nice that you tried to find solutions for her besides tying her hair back, but I would've tried something more flattering. Like a chef hat or something to wear over it.", "NTA.  What else could you have done?!??", "NTA\n\nShe was asked and knows she sheds. She should be embarrassed.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to save her from this. She refused to listen. This is 100% on her.", "NTA. Hair in food is disgusting. A hairnet seems a bit extreme for a domestic kitchen but I can understand why you went there. You've highlighted this as an issue to her before and she refuses to address it. Maybe now someone else has raised it she might start to take it seriously. I honestly don't know what else you can do to make her understand - maybe if you frame it as a phobia? I'm slightly uncomfortable suggesting that but if it helped her to understand the depth of your (completely normal) aversion, maybe she'd be prepared to take some simple steps to avoid getting her hair in your food. Otherwise, you're well within your rights to just cook for yourself forever, in my opinion. Good luck!", "NTA. She f'd around and found out. You have been gently telling her these for years and now maybe the message finally sunk in.", "Grab a hat she can stuff her hair in while she cooks. \n\nI kinda wonder if her iron is low? That\u2019s when my hair falls out like mad. Or if I scratch or rub my hair it sheds. You are NTA for not wanting hair in your food and your family\u2019s reaction is fair too.", "NTA.  I have really long hair, it gets everywhere, but when I'm cooking it is always pulled back in some sort of hair clip.  I don't want to eat my hair.  It's not your fault she is embarassed, she needs to deal with it.  To be honest I would just stop eating anything she cooks, she can eat leftovers, make your own hairfree food!", "NTA. Get her a custom sign that says \u201cplease tie your hair\u201d and stick it somewhere in the kitchen. Double down and put a trinket dish on the countertop with hair ties on them.\n\nEdit: if you go with the sign, try to make it funny so it doesn\u2019t come off offensive.

But I don\u2019t think she will do it.  \n\nGet lint rollers and she needs to use at the bottoms of her hair to pick up loose stands.  Our kids school cafeteria lady refused to wear hairnets and there was hair found constantly in the food.  They had to threaten termination to get her to do it.  \n\nEvery time you find a hair make a huge deal out of it and even act like you are vomiting in the bathroom.  Even do this if there are guests. Hopefully this drives it home to her.", "ewwwwww NTA but ewwwwwww except the parents who called it out. yall are behaving nasty as hell... why would you keep eating the food knowing the hair is in there? whats wrong with your wife that she thinks ppl want a hair salad? this is disgusting. also why is accountability alluding her? havent you been saying the SAME things to her for years? and now its your fault that SHE is unhygienic and doesnt listen? lmfaooo the jokes there incredible.", "ESH\n\nThis is disgusting on so many levels. Let me guess. Y\u2019all don\u2019t wash your chicken either?\n\nYour wife is an AH for obvious reasons. YTA for not taking a stance and putting your foot down years ago. Hair doesn\u2019t just end up in food like that. Is she playing with her hair in the kitchen?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Suggest therapy I guess ?", "NTA. I have hair down past my hips and I always tie my hair back and pin it before cooking. It's basic hygiene.", "NTA. I feel like she's either putting it intentionally in the food. Because it's normal to lose hairs every day. But to always lose hair while she is cooking meals is very suspicious. Idk it just seems off. Plus I'd be embarrassed as heck if my guests found food in their hair", "NTA. When she actually **does** tie her hair back, do you still find hair in the food? If so, some of it may be coming off her clothing. If she sheds a good bit, it may be hanging out on her shirt and falling off during cooking.
