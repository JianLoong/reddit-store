Either way, if people tell you your hair is getting in the food and you do nothing, you are pretty disgusting.", "NTA, gross", "I found my own hair in food twice as a young adult and have obsessively put my hair up every time since then. Sometimes it takes one moment, and sometimes it takes massive embarrassment to learn the lesson. \n\nOnly OP's wife knows if this will be what shocks her back to reality. NTA", "NTA\n\nBut I think maybe your wife needs to go to a professional hair stylist who specializes in hair loss. As others have pointed out, even with long hair that's not tied back that's a LOT of hair in the food. Most people would only find one every couple months/years, certainly not every meal.\n\nMaybe she doesn't wear the hair nets because she struggles with hair loss and is embarrassed by it?", "This whole post makes me want to \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA, you\u2019ve told her, offered to cook and even bought hair nets. She\u2019s an adult, I don\u2019t understand why this is so difficult for her. I would feel so embarrassed if I were her but it\u2019s all on her. She needs to make being sanitary a priority.", "sit her down and ask her directly 1) Did she feel bad about the hair in the food for Thanksgiving. 2)If she has any idea HOW the food got into it, 3) IF she would like that to not happen again, 4) what steps she thinks can lead to her air not being in the food.\n\nMaybe she has oddly not understood the sequence of events.\n\nMaybe tell her pretend she's a superhero character The Terrific Chef and she needs to wear the costume.\n\nSounds like there is some difficulty in her understanding the logical consequences of things...", "I'm really confused by this. Like is there a reason she's point blank refusing to let you cook food? I understand enjoying cooking, but you say she's insisting on cooking every single meal with no help, I'm not sure I've encountered anyone who loves cooking THAT much. Then you say she is upset with you for not helping out. These two things are very inconsistent and I am feeling like there may be more to this story. \n\nTaking what you've said at face value then I can't say you're being an arsehole. But add more information into the gaping plotholes of this story and it's possible you could be.", "NTA\n\nMaybe she has some sort of kink?", "NTA. My daughter and I both have long curly hair, it gets everywhere. I\u2019ve found it in some strange places - recently one was stuck inside the refrigerator. But never in our food.", "Idk how it\u2019s not getting noticed Nta", "My wife\u2019s hair gets on a lot of things at home but she ties it up the rare times she cooks. I usually cook. Even my cats know to stay away from me and the cooking area while we\u2019re actively cooking. NTA", "This is what I think as well!", "You would have lost either way. If you'd actually done what she says you should have and demanded she not cook, she'd have been just as pissed at you for being controlling. You did the right thing by letting her face the consequences for herself and hopefully now she actually understands what you've been trying to tell her.", "No it\u2019s not lmfao she can cook in her own home but if she keeps doing this after reminders and alternatives then she is an AH and OP is not. Buying the box of hairnets when she is constantly told about a problem is not an AH move.", "Even then if she has long hair she would notice the hair strands hanging on her hands and stuff and even falling down in the food. idk what her problem is, OP is just asking to not have to eat food with hair in it, he isnt asking for the moon", "Yep. My cat has super fine hair that floats and gets everywhere, so I always wipe my kitchen down before cooking. Never had hair of any species in my food. Wife sounds like she\u2019s just more of a slob than tidy.", "I honestly *don't* think she'll put it into a bun. That's why I said that I had no idea how to solve the problem in a follow up comment. She's being ridiculous about the whole thing, but my point was that if a hair net or ponytail wasn't a viable solution than neither was a chef's hat. If she won't do the easier thing, I can't imagine she'd be cool with a more complicated option.", "OP, tell your wife if she doesn't wear a toque, then she's a hoser!", "This is one of those times where you should\u2019ve ran to her parents. If her father\u2019s reaction was enough to scare her straight, then they would\u2019ve been able to nip this in the bud before dinner.", "Nta. My husband and I both have longer hair and when we cook we both keep our hair back.  There were a few times I found one of my husband's hairs in my food when he cooked and he was mortified.  Ever since he always ties it back AND uses a bandana.  I keep my hair tied back and then use a thick headband to keep any babyhairs from falling.  Hopefully your wife will get with the program and do the same.  Best of luck op!", "NTA. Is she styling her hair in the kitchen with while cooking to save time?", "I have really long hair, if my husband finds a hair in my food he physically vomits, and apologises he doesn't mean to it's just a thing that grosses him out. And I feel awful! Now I always remeber to tie my hair back. Sometimes these things happen, it maybe happens once every 6 months? Maybe less? So the fact that it's every meal is rank, like truely rank. And it makes me judge her in the kitchen and I don't judge lightly. How slovenly is she?? Does she wash her hands??? Honestly I would just make my own dinner, and say sorry I physically can't eat any more of your food.", "NTA.  Sometimes, people only learn the hard way.  You tried to tell her and she didn't listen.  So, that's on her, not you.", "I shed A LOT and I would be mortified if someone found my hair in their food. \n\nNTA and I hope she realizes that what she is doing is fucking weird if intentional and negligent if not.", "Ewww\n\nNTA \n\nMaybe the bald look will be beneficial for her since she has no hygiene.", "Maybe her hair is the secret ingredient of her cooking\u2026.\nNTA", "NTA and I'm so confused! \n\nI almost agree with you that it must be intentional, but then she was very embarrassed when it happened with her family? So then it wasn't intentional? She knows it happens, doesn't care enough to take care of it just for you, doesn't care enough to address it when cooking for company, then is mortified when there's hair in the food she served? She isn't making any sense.\n\nAlso: HOW ON EARTH IS SHE GETTING THAT MUCH HAIR IN THE FOOD IF IT ISN'T ON PURPOSE???\n\nI have very long hair, almost to my hips. I usually tie it up to keep it out of my way while cooking, but I do sometimes forget, or it'll fall out as I'm working and I won't remember to put it back up unless it's actively impeding me. I can't even remember the last time there was hair in something I cooked. It's happened, certainly, but I can't recall an instance in the last 2 years.", "NTA!!! I have had long hair all my life (as do my sisters and mother) and i can count on one hand the times i have found hair in my food. The hell!!", "NTA\n\nYour wife is rightly embarrassed and deflecting the blame on to you. You talked to her and bought her hair nets to use. She insists on cooking and then gets mad at you for what? You offered the help, she didn't want it. She needs to take responsibility and just keep her hair in the net. Or she can stop insisting on cooking.", "NTA\n\nI shed like nobodies business and I love to cook, which is why I tie up my hair very well when I\u2019m in the kitchen. It\u2019s a curtesy thing, don\u2019t get hair in the food, makes sense.", "NTA, how the hell is she going to blame you, not your hair they found in the food", "Just stop eating her food. If she wants to eat her own hair or serve it to her family, not your problem. Just don\u2019t have this argument with her anymore.", "NTA; i shed like a horse and have hair to my ass and i would rather go bald than cook with my hair down because hair makes me heave", "NTA.  Are you sure this isn\u2019t some fetish thing or a power move shes trying to pull?  I shed like crazy and I have never gotten hair in my food.", "NTA\n\nFathom the delusion involved in blaming someone else for YOUR hair getting in the food YOU are preparing,", "NTA Why is she so insistent on not restraining her hair? If every time you found a hair the food was thrown out maybe she would learn.", "Ditto, I have very long thick hair and there is no way I would cook or bake with my hair down. As a kid I would not listen to my mother about tying my hair back and  when I was about 12 ish making brownies I ended up with a hand mixer bound up in my hair. What a mess!\n\nI also don't eat at houses where the cook keeps their hair hanging over food.", "How is that much hair getting in the food though? Like honestly? I lose my hair like crazy and don\u2019t normally put my hair up when I\u2019m casually cooking for myself, and I never find hair in my food. How is this happening?\nYou could buy a pack of scrunchies/hair ties and keep them in a container in the kitchen on the counter or next to the stove, that way they\u2019re on hand and visible, but not as embarrassing as a hair net.", "This was my question too! I mean, I get it, sometimes a hair is going to end up where it\u2019s not supposed to be. Even if you turn it back the way OP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t. But \u2026 This much hair??? It\u2019s either deliberate or possibly a symptom of something???", "One consents to eating ass, not to eating hair in their dinner.\n\nIt's that simple.", "You're wrong.\n\nFirst, any hair in your food is gross; doesn't matter if its yours or someone else's.\n\nSecond, OP's wife's lack of care about hair in the food negatively impacted others who came to eat dinner. Hair was found in multiple dishes and most people find that pretty gross.\n\nOP offered solutions such as offering to cook or getting her hairnets to avoid getting hair in the food and she's blaming him for her embarrassment. It's insanity to think the wife is the victim here when she's the source of the problem itself.", "Hair falls out naturally, for some it falls out more than others. Of course the wife wouldn't wear a hairnet in her own home, that would be humiliating. And as OP said, she loves cooking, why would they want to prevent that? Those are two pretty shitty solutions that he offered. \n\nHair in food is only gross if you are squeamish or a child, most grown adults develop enough sense to realise they can just take the hair out and continue on with their lives because it won't do them any harm in the slightest.", "No one wants to crush her enjoyment of cooking, but people are allowed to not want hair in their food without being told they're \"squeamish or a child\". That's why restaurants don't just tell you to suck it up when a hair shows up in your meal. If she's not willing to take the steps necessary to make sure her hair doesn't end up in someone else's mouth then she shouldn't be cooking the meals.\n\nIt's pretty weird to trust someone who doesn't care what ends up in the dish to cook for you.", "I think it's a bit unfair to assume she doesn't care or isn't trying. He said in the OP that she had been tying her hair back to prevent it but just occasionally forgets. It could just be something that's embarrassing for her that she'd rather not highlight and her family is making a huge deal out of.\n\nYou definitely should just suck it up if a hair shows up in your meal in a restaurant though, making a big deal out of something small like that and inconveniencing the staff is pretty uncool.", "I stand corrected, I guess that's the kind of advanced skills they teach you in culinary school...", "Do you just keep allowing your gross hair to fall into the food you serve people when it's happened on multiple occasions?", "That's my issue when I find my own hair in my food that ik where it's been\ud83e\udd22 \ud83d\ude05", "Oui, oui."]}
