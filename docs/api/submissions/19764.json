He is very controlling and I don't know how long you both have been together, but WTF.  Seems most women in the gym are wearing leggings.  If he has a problem with them, maybe it's because he can't trust himself seeing other women wearing them?  Compromise is fine if it's an issue he has any say in, and this is not it.   His logic seems to suggest all he has to say is it make him uncomfortable and you can't do it.   He has a trust/jealousy issue and it's not just directed at other guys but at you.

Something took place in the past for your boyfriend to  feel this way, whether it was the fact that you or a previous girl cheated on him, or have had interactions with other guys that have lead to certain things, and he wants to mitigate a repeat of said situation.\n\n2. You don't respect his boundaries, which in turn means, either he doesn't give you everything you want from a guy to fully love, admire and respect him, or you see him as a placeholder boyfriend until something better comes along.\n\nThe conclusion to this is that no one is the AH, you need to sit with him and talk about it like adults and come to a consensus where you are both happy. \n\nI wish you the best of luck in life!", "This might be controversial but ESH. \n\nHim for obvious reasons, he seems insecure and really should work on that and his idea of compromise is getting his way which is very worrying.

The reality is that adult and mature relationships do require compromise here and there, however not the way he thinks.
