Your relationship with your father was strained because when your mother kicked you out, he didn't defend you. It's great that you're repairing your relationship, but you have the right to decide at what pace you want to have it go at. So, if you decide you're not yet ready to go to his celebrations, he needs to be accepting of that. On top of this, Mike is handling this much more maturely than your *own family*. I don't know how much they know about why it fractured in the first place. If they know all of it, I would have expected that they would be at least a little bit more understanding of why you'd say no.

A few months doesn't heal the hurts that his behavior has caused to you, either. \n\nI'm wondering if the few months was BECAUSE of the party, so he could have his party be perfectly how he wants it?

Either way, **this isn't your fault.**   \n\nIt's not your fault that he \"was excited\".  It's not your responsibility to fix his feelings when he's disappointed.
