But anyways as you can imagine I was wearing less designer and more thrifted lol which did not make me popular.\n\nOne day at school this girl and her friends shoved me in a gym locker while they were teasing me about my clothes saying \u201cthat\u2019s where the stinky stuff should stay\u201d or something along the lines of that I can\u2019t quite remember. I came home crying of course and my parents were furious. They when marching into the school and we had a meeting with her the next day. Needless to say her parents didn\u2019t understand why they were \u201cgetting punished for giving their daughter the world\u201d.\nThat was when I realized that I was glad my parents couldn\u2019t give me the world, because the last thing I wanted to do was end up entitled like her.\n\nAt the end of the day I commend you for trying to teach your kids that just because you can afford it doesn\u2019t mean you need it. Tbh I don\u2019t know if a whole paper about the specific item is necessary, but explaining why it is important for them to get those luxury\u2019s sounds like something that might benefit them in the long run. \nPlus a lot of those high brand companies do run genuine sweat shops. And also 14 and 15 is a little young to me for brand new iPhones (idk I don\u2019t have kids of my own).\n\nNTA But the whole paper might be a little much maybe more like and honest discussion on why they want it, or a paragraph. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA.

HA HA HA \n\nThey're getting fed, clothed, sheltered, educated, medical care when/if necessary, not being beaten, chained to the radiator, nor forced to live in rooms w inches of animal or their own waste (presumably). Idiot woman. \n\nOtherwise,  I think it a good idea. This just reinforces the idea that xmas has just become about getting stuff. Ugh.", "YTA. Gifts are about wants not needs. Giving her glasses as a present when you are responsible for buying them anyway is a shitty thing to do.", "Probably gonna get downvoted but whatever\n\nNTA I love this. As someone who had parents where writing essays were a big thing, I look back and think about how awesome that was. Don\u2019t get me wrong, hated it as a kid, but my communication and writing skills were far beyond what was expected for my age. My older sister majored in English. When they were used as punishments, I was given time to reflect on my actions in a way that actually taught me what I had done wrong and how I could avoid doing that behavior in the future. \n\nI also think that this holds a very important lesson, given that a lot of the high end company\u2019s have some fucked up practices. It gives them time to reflect on why they ACTUALLY want these things. Is it peer pressure? Is it marketing from media? Do they feel like they will gain something from these items? Is there something else the money could be better spent on that they truly want?\n\nAs an au pair that has seen some major spoiled kids, this helps dissuade that behavior. \n\nIdk I just love this idea.", "NTA, and I'm shocked at all the \"Y T A\" responses. You stated that they had the option to do some volunteering instead, and picked the papers (probably because they sounded like \"less work\"). I don't see this as \"homework for christmas,\" but rather an important step toward mindful consumer practices. These kids are at an age where popularity, and owning popular brands, is suddenly the most important thing. And they know you and dad have the money to give them a \"fast pass\" to whatever it is they want. But it's really, really important to teach them that while you want to give them nice things in life, they can't expect designer everything on a whim, and that it's important to decide for yourself what \"status symbols\" are really worth it. Some designer bags/clothes/shoes are lovely and well-made and don't use unethical labor; some aren't. Moreover, if getting the latest nicest thing is too easy and meaninglessness, it's likely they'll get bored of it in a month or two and be demanding something else. So like, it's a little unusual but it's not unreasonable and it will get them to actually appreciate the extremely nice things they get, and to think a little harder about what's worth it to them. You go, and keep working on raising kind, un-spoiled members of society.", "YTA. Your children gave you their wishlist, which you asked for.  You gave them carte blanche when you should have asked them what one item they most want. There is absolutely no reason why they need every single thing on it and no reason why they have to have expensive items. Some of those items are good life lessons on earning the money to buy it themselves. Christmas is about giving, there shouldn't be any strings attached, so yeah, making them earn their gifts is crappy of you. Oh and please, eyeglasses are a necessity not a Christmas gift.", "NTA, but it sounds like they\u2019re at a really materialistic point of their lives. I\u2019d explain to them why it\u2019s financially not a good decision to spend thousands on name brand clothes while they are still growing and what \u2018name brand\u2019 really meant.\n\nRather than how they source things or pay employees (stuff your kids won\u2019t care about if you make them do it) make them explain why brand x? Is it just to be popular or show off, or is it for quality? My parents did something like that when I was 15 and asked for Abercrombie shirts. My mom said \u2018I will buy one for you if it\u2019s important, but I thought I raised you better than to care what brand shirt you have\u2019 and it has saved me thousands years later", "INFO - why can't they share the work?\n\nI agree with the premise that they should learn to research the companies and their ethics when they want expensive gifts, but you are going too far if you are insisting on multiple detailed reports on the same topic with a certain word count required.\n\nI think the exercise would be much more productive and rewarding if you made it a group project, and got them to decide amongst themselves which is the most ethical and cost-effective company, and then present their reasons. This could be a valuable skill that will be beneficial for them for the rest of their lives - learn to research the ethics of a company before making a purchase.... sometimes the most desirable brand isn't the most ethical or reliable.\n\nHowever, it sounds like you are making this project almost impossible for them to complete, so you can use it as an excuse not to buy them these gifts. If this is the case, then Y T A.", "INFO: Why do their gifts \"need to improve their lives?\" I get not getting everything on their lists, that is reasonable. But gifts are suppose to be fun. Socks, hair ties, eyeglasses (which you are legally obligated to supply as it is), and things for sports are not fun gifts. Writing research papers for a gift is just making a gift a chore. \n\nDoes your kid need expensive makeup? No. But it is fun and something she wouldn't normally get. Do your boys need expensive sneakers? No, but again, it is fun and something they wouldn't normally get. Isn't that the point? \n\nFor now, YTA. You don't really want to buy gifts and that seems to be the main issue. Setting a dollar amount, choosing one or two things from each list and gifting those would be a better plan.

The gifts they want are quite extravagant, and you are trying to raise enlightened, not entitled, kids. But you have a big problem if all the other adults in their lives are contradicting you. Perhaps you can make it a family exercise to do the research and discussion together this time so they understand the \u201cwhy\u201d behind your assignment.

But some stuff, she has to earn/work for\u2026I believe that\u2019s the same lesson you are teaching here.", "NTA - You want your children to be educated and aware of the price that people pay to have luxuries.

So it\u2019s not \u201cno Christmas\u201d, just not a multi-thousand dollar one.

Excluding whoever said they were gonna call CPS, jeez that\u2019s an overreaction. Honestly, I would be busting out my writing skills if it meant i could get everything on my Christmas list. However, this is a bit of a drastic measure for each one. I would say, they should each have to do one paper each, with a paragraph for each company they want to buy from. I also want to add, wishlists are just that, wishing for what you want, doesn\u2019t mean you get everything on it. Me and my sister usually got a decent amount of gifts, but usually one in particular would be the big expensive one. If your kids expect to be handed every present on that list, you and your wife did something wrong with the parenting. Also, needs shouldn\u2019t be Christmas presents. And no, your daughter doesn\u2019t need dior frames for her glasses, who tf can tell the difference, glasses are expensive enough.", "NTA There are needs and there are wants. Then there is ridiculous. This whole influencer crud is ridiculous IMO. Making them work for luxuries is not a bad idea. If this is how you want to handle xmas for them and can handle the cost, then what others think doesn't really matter. We've all been through the 'but my friends all have one' ourselves while growing up. It's just a shame that the things kids want now are so expensive and are disposable after such a short time.", "NTA, though there may be better tactics. When I got my first laptop for Christmas, my parents only paid for half of it; I saved up the other half myself via allowance, extra chores/work for other family, etc. (this was back when laptops were much more expensive than now, ~20 years ago).  I think an option like that may be better than homework assignments or a decent alternative to them.\n\nI get what people are saying about how gifts are about wants instead of needs, but they should still be reasonable and entitlement should still probably be curtailed. Asking for *a* really pricey gift is one thing, but multiple pricey ones for one holiday sounds a bit ridiculous. Though kids should get some gifts they want and enjoy, they also still have to learn reasonable spending, lessons like not always getting every little thing one wants, understanding the value of things etc. and it sounds like the homework assignment is geared towards some of those lessons.\n\nI would be pretty lenient with the answers, though. The hours of enjoyment or socializing that comes with the gift is still a life improvement, if they articulate as much.", "NTA, but your aunt is. What\u2019s wrong with her? How is this even abusive to call CPS?  She needs to do research paper herself on that matter. \n\nAnyhow, you should apologize to kids saying I\u2019m sorry we were making you do homework for your gifts.  I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t teach you about the spirit of Christmas and made you think it\u2019s about material things. You\u2019ll get your gifts, but it\u2019ll be what we choose.  As for things you want, you\u2019ve reached an age where you need to learn the difference between needs and wants. Your needs will be taken care of. Your wants should be earned, except each year you may have a \u201cwant\u201d fulfilled for your birthday up to a certain budget. You may earn more for the budget if you choose to do bonus research projects.", "Of course, It\u2019s not just the expensive things they should learn about.

Then saying what they want for Christmas =/= that they get it.  Select one of the more spendy items from each of their lists to give them.  Making them do work to get a gift is ridiculous though.

I'm a teenager (17) and although I do see expensive things like Dior, Chanel, and Kylie makeup and want them, I don't ask for them even though my parents can afford them.

It's ok to want an ipad, maybe a new phone, some new makeup, nice shoes, but it's not reasonable to expect all of it to be luxury brand. Especially at 15 and 14 years old. Instead of making them write papers, just tell them you can get those for them later or they can buy those themselves at a later age, maybe at 18, or when they have their own money.

However, I think it is fair to ask them to pick out the top item they want and also fine to get fancier versions of needed items as a present. \n\nI also wouldn't be too hard on them for wanting to keep up with their friends as peer pressure is awful. At school everyone wore kickers (I am so old) and heaven help you if you wore 'uncool' shoes. As you get older it is easier to resist social pressure, but even as a stubborn rebellious teenager I did cave now and again. Volunteer work is a good idea because it does help to give some perspective but no organisation wants volunteers who don't want to be there as it is hell. What about getting them to buy some things from the Santa's little helpers sub on here so they can see that some people aren't nearly as fortunate? No awkward volunteering but a lesson learned and nice for the kids who may have nothing on Christmas day. \n\nAlso, I love makeup and while I spend a lot of times googling dupes because some things are the same formulation, just in a fancier bottle, some expensive makeup is better.

Their list is actually not unreasonable (you have the money). It's not like they put eg yacht on it.

You could easily decide to get them cheap stuff instead. Your aunt is nuts, CPS is busy enough without answering calls about kids upset they didn't get expensive gifts. There's probably kids out there who think getting one meal a day is a gift.\n\nOn a personal note, I find their entitled behaviour astounding. I like getting Christmas gifts, but I rarely have any actual requests. If I do, it's maybe one or two things and not insanely expensive. If I did get something pricey, I probably wouldn't get much if anything else from the giver. That's perfectly fine. If someone offered to get me multiple expensive gifts if I completed a certain task, I'd be happy to do it. But these kids just expect a pile of luxury items? Seriously?
