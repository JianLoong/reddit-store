Much of my time I\u2019ve been playing games with friends and hunting for achievements after having been unable to do so thanks to previous workloads, but I also am doing some studying in between along with helping around the house when asked and looking for summer work.\n\nNo matter how many times I make it abundantly clear, my family still won\u2019t respect my boundaries. One important one is my bedroom. Even though I\u2019ve said that a closed door is a very visible boundary, my parents, younger brother, and older sister when she comes to visit often just turn open the doorknob and barge in to ask or tell me about some pretty mundane stuff most of the time. It\u2019s mildly understandable with a slightly ajar or fully open door, but it\u2019s summertime and in the late evenings we let in some cool air. But if they knock and I don\u2019t respond because I have my AirPods in, then they just barge in anyway.\n\nMy younger brother is the worst of the bunch. He oftentimes goes into my room to tell me about a mundane story about what happened at high school with his friends, and it\u2019s tiring having to remind him for the billionth time that I simply am not interested. Sometimes when I was away at college, he would have gone into my room and used something like a notebook I was keeping for notes or my cardioid mic for a therapy session without even asking me on the phone. He doesn\u2019t even put it back when he\u2019s done, and I\u2019m tired of literally yelling at him to stay out of my room and not touch my shit, because I don\u2019t do that to him.\n\nA couple of days ago my brother barged into my room to simply hand me a snack I didn\u2019t even ask for whilst I was playing my game, which I was trying out with some R18+ mods. My door was closed and I didn\u2019t even realise he was there, and I again told him, don\u2019t randomly barge into my room, dammit. Then yesterday we had a family gathering and my brother proceeded to fucking tell people about the mods I had been using to try and embarrass me. I was pretty goddamn pissed even though I made up a story on the spot about how I had accidentally joined an R18+ game, which I also told my parents when they asked me about it, and when my brother insisted otherwise I essentially had to gaslight him into thinking he massively misremembered things.\n\nAfter that I decided I\u2019ve fucking HAD IT. I hauled my ass to the bus, went to Lowe\u2019s, bought myself a door knob lock, and swapped it out myself.\n\nEarlier today I had locked my door and later heard it jiggle, then some knocks. It was my brother and I told him that thanks to him I had no choice but to install a lock on my door, which he then told my parents about. Dad lectured me about how I don\u2019t \u201cmodify his house without permission\u201d, to which I shot back that nobody modifies my privacy without permission, and simply put in my earbuds. Since then dad\u2019s blocked my devices from Wi-Fi until we discuss \u201clogistics\u201d of my door lock, and I\u2019ve been using USB tethering since.

You mentioned therapy, man I hope he isn't struggling and reaching out to you and you're being like this.", "ESH \nOh boy where do I start...\nIt's ridiculous how mad you are about your sibling simply wanting to socialize with you. \nYou shouldn't have your headphones up so loud you can't hear the outside world.\nThere was no need to lie about the mods you're literally an adult.\nAnd you should be allowed to have a lock on your door, but honestly I just feel it's more of an angle to not have to interact with others.\nI feel like all the issues can be resolved through talking I feel like there's a lot of anger and miscommunication going on here", "You are NTA for wanting a door that locks. My eldest son is exactly your age. He loves to game. He wears headphones and can't always hear me call for him. So I text, or knock and enter. His door locks if he wants absolute privacy. He just graduated college and is headed to grad school. He had an internship this summer. \n\nIf my kid treated our family with the contempt and disrespect you are showing yours, I might take things away, too. You are the AH for screaming obscenities at your younger siblings. You will be graduating in about a year, right? You should have secured yourself an internship starting in December or so for the summer. This \"looking for a job,\" but not really looking because you're gaming all day is what teenagers do. Set yourself up for success when you graduate. And try to have mature, reasonable, adult conversations with the people who love you, starting with your dad. \n\nIt's reasonable to want a lock. It's not reasonable to be an AH to the people who are putting a roof over your head (or just want to spend time with you. That younger brother deserves better than you're giving, too.)", "Privacy is one thing but God you sound insufferable\nYour sibling is trying to be social because he respect /enjoy your company.

Angle the monitor away from the door so you can play your hentai mods. Good luck this summer hope you finish school strong.", "NTA, basic privacy should be reasonably expected.", "I'm going to go with YTA.\n\nYou modified your parent's house without asking. You did so as you knew they would say no.\n\nYour brother is clearly wanting to spend time with you and yes I get that's it's annoying, but he is your brother.\n\nYou are wining about the lack of knocking and then say that when they did knock you could not hear them due to having your airpods in. Sounds like knocking is pointless? \n\nI understand the desire for the lock, but there were easier solutions. A sign, refusing to listen or talk until they close the door and knock (this is how I dealt with it as a teenager). You could always moved something in the way of the door (soft edged to prevent damage) like a bean bag seat, ruck sack, or just a towel to prevent it being open more than ajar.", "ESH .\nPrivacy is a right , however your parents do have a point that you should have asked about installing a different door knob .\nyou state that you\u2019ve discussed with them about a closed door = privacy , yet , you keep your door slightly open so that air can ventilate ? and when they DO knock , you can\u2019t hear them because of your headphones ? \nIt sounds very much like miscommunications , but also as though you just do not like being in the same house as your family period", "Yes, YTA, both for screaming profanities at your family and for taking it upon yourself to modify your parents\u2019 home. It may have been possible to negotiate a lock with your parents prior to you escalating the situation, but even if you were renting an apartment you wouldn\u2019t have the right to make permanent modifications without landlord approval. \n\nWho is paying for your college, and what are your plans after you graduate?  You seem to be fairly entitled, you\u2019re in for a shock when you have to start paying your own way.", "NTA. My college aged kid lives at home and I\u2019m the one who installed the lock on their door myself! \n\nKids need privacy especially at your age \u2014 and if that can\u2019t be respected then it\u2019s perfectly fine to take matters into your own hands. You\u2019ve tried to tell them this multiple times. Maybe now they\u2019ll listen!", "You sound like a self-important, self-centered, entitled jerk, so yes, YTA.  So glad you're not my older brother.", "YTA. \n\nIf you want privacy so much, get your own place. You're not going to get it while you still live at home, that's your parent's house, not yours. Act like an adult, Mr. 21.", "YTA. Everyone should get some privacy but when your in your parents house your say in the matter is limited. If you want privacy it is time to get an apartment, we all had to do it and it is tough but it is worth it. You posted you are looking for a job so currently you are living and eating rent free. The small amount of chores you do are your contribution to the house hold. If you had a job and were paying rent you absolutely could install a lock. Right now you had no right to modify your parents house without permission. Stop playing games, get out there find a job and get your privacy. Welcome to adulthood, life is not fair but when your living on your dime your get to make your own rules.", "YTA you don\u2019t pay the mortgage, you don\u2019t get the change locks without permission.

I understand you\u2019re frustrated but you still don\u2019t get a pass at treating people like that. I think it\u2019s safe to assume, since they know you often have your earbuds in, that you might not even hear them knocking. \n\nWork on your temper, it might get you farther in life to not blow your stack.", "ESH. Yes, you should be able to expect privacy but your dad is right that you shouldn't just modify the house without his say so when you've not even properly discussed things with your family. Thing to suggest instead of a lock, a door stop. Cheaper than a new lock and entirely removable. Just shove it at the base of the door and nobody it getting in without you moving it.", "Yes, YTA. You're all adult in your mind yet fail to just admit to whatever you were doing when it was brought up, you're actually not very adult at all.   \nYou say you \"gaslit\" your brother, to avoid getting into trouble Im assuming considering your stupid made up on the spot story and then think you're entitled to changing a fixture in someone else's home.  \nYour brother should've been punished for his continued barging in, on the other hand being excited you're home visiting and wanting to bring you a snack isnt exactly punishment worthy.  \nHow about if you're wanting to do shit you cant do in your parents home you either move out or, wait till youre back at school again?", "Grow up and quit hiding in your room.", "NTA why should you respect any of them if they refuse to respect you.", "NTA. You are asking for so little. Maybe find somewhere else to be next summer.", "NTA. Some of these comments blow my mind. Someone such as your brother or god forbid sisters walk in one day and see you buttass naked and you\u2019re supposed to just let that shit happen whenever THEY please? \n\nYou\u2019ve warned them countless times to cut the shit. I did kinda feel bad for your brother at first, since it seemed like he just wanted to interact with you, but after pulling that little stunt of telling the whole family about your mods, I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s 100% doing it to fuck with you and knows he\u2019d keep getting away with it. Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA\n\nI grew up in a big family where people would just waltz into your room without knocking. My door latch was damaged from the amount of times people would do this. I rearranged my room to have the door facing my desk and put a washing basket there so the door would bounce back from the springiness of it.  After hitting two siblings in the face with my door because they walked into it they began to learn.\n\nYou can also buy door wedges/door stops that do a similar thing and don't require changing the door knob.", "NTA - but personally, I think you should have handled it a bit differently. What you should have done is get one of those temporary door locks, such as the Addalock. That way, you can lock your door without modifying anything in the house. That way, your dad doesn't have a leg to stand on, and you can stop people from barging into your room as need be.", "Nta. \n\nTell your dad that if the privacy being invaded was his, he would not be happy about your brother's behaviour. If your father was naked or trying to sleep or having intimacy with his partner and your brother barged in, he would be pissed.\n\nLet them know that if this level of disrespect and inconsiderate behaviour is how they want to move forward, then you won't make your stay a long one. Whether you mean it or not. Just put it out there. You need to send a message of some sort.", "ESH\n\nYour family needs to learn to wait for you to answer before barging in.  At a certain point, make it painful for them. Just be butt ass naked in your room. They wanna see you so bad then, oh well. \n\nAnd yes, it would be wonderful if you got along with your younger brother. He clearly wants to bond with you. BUT sometimes it just doesn't happen when siblings are in different life stages. It isn't something you can force. Sometimes, siblings click better as adults.\n\nYou should have talked to your parents before getting a lock. It is their house. It's time for you to work double time on getting a job. The life you want isn't possible in your parents' home. Living on your own will.come with challenges, but when things are this tense, you have to make sacrifices.", "Every time I see posts like this I am utterly baffled by the lack of locks on doors in y'all's houses.

That kind of thing can be really annoying and does wear down at you when it's an everyday occurrence. My parents do stuff like that all the time and it's frustrating as hell.

My parents are annoying because they like me and want to bond with/talk to me. I accepted the frustration of frequent interruptions while living in their house because I understood that. I never once told them I didn't care about their lives just because I was annoyed at the interruption. \n\nAdmittedly they didn't barge into my room to do so... but I also wasn't holed up in my room 24/7 (ETA: or wearing earbuds constantly so I couldn't even hear them knocking on my door).

I disagree with my brother on many things but I've never told him \"i dont care about what you're telling me\" since i became an adult because i grew tf up and realised thats rude lol.

Installing the lock, wanting privacy etc is reasonable. Telling his younger brother he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about his day at school\u201d when the kid probably just misses his brother after he\u2019s been at college for months is asshole behaviour and childish.", "Boundaries are good, sticking your headphones in to stop any discussion of modifying his door without even talking to the owners of the house first isn't.

People simply barging in on each other is not to be considered as acceptable.\n\nThat said, the original poster is definitely acting like a petulant teenager and going about things in the wrong way, throwing temper tantrums and acting stroppy as all heck. Popping in earbuds and walking away from your dad mid conversation is grounds for more than a talking to, no matter how old you are, and responding to being cut off the home Wi-Fi by USB tethering use some next-level petty hard-headedness.", "Man, I hope you don\u2019t delete this post and look back on it in a couple of years.

When I lived with roommates they also would knock on my door to ask me something. Maybe something broke and needs to be fixed, maybe they want to ask if it is okay someone is coming over, etc. And yes, there are times you can say you have no time. But at some point you have to let them in because they can't tell at a later time. It is just life when you live with people.
