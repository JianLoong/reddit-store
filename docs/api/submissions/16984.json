Later Kyla came up to my room and said I need to stop embarrassing Jack and making him feel bad about leaving up the seat. She told me he\u2019s feeling really self-conscious about it and didn\u2019t appreciate me bringing it up all the time (this is second time I\u2019ve mentioned this since we moved in 5 months ago).

Kyla said she doesn\u2019t want me bringing it up with Jack again but I said that\u2019s too bad and I\u2019m going to be mentioning it every time he does it until he starts remembering to put it down.

Why don't you put a sign on the wall that says remember to put the seat down. To help him remember. And everytime he leaves it up tell him and get him to put it down instead of doing it yourself. That way he can get into practice with putting it down. I have to get the guy  in my house to clean up pee they left on the toilet seat every time I find it. And since then its been happening way less often.

People learn by correcting their mistakes. This applies to paperwork (hello federally regulated production job!), pizzas (have you seen that screenshot post about the pizza chain that makes whichever employee who messed up a pizza remake and deliver the new one? It was in the context of the customer not wanting a new one so they made the employee stand in the corner instead lol), and just about everything else. So, if you\u2019re not already doing this (unclear), interrupt whatever he may be doing and have him literally come in and out the seat down, wash his hands, and then leave so you can pee, whenever you see it up. (ETA: EVERY time. Every single time.) Take the burden of his carelessness and uno reverse it right back onto him. If he insists on inconveniencing you, he is going to have a very inconvenient time dragging his ass to the bathroom to put the seat down every time you need to pee, until he figures out that it\u2019s much less inconvenient for him to just do it when he\u2019s already in there having just peed himself.\n\nAnd if Kyla has an issue\u2026 remind her that the problem starts and ends with him and he has 100% of the power to eliminate this is issue entirely and he is welcome to do so if he\u2019s not enjoying the consequences of his choices.", "Right? You can't be self conscious about something while simultaneously being unconscious about it.\nWhat a hill to die on.", "If the next user is likely to be someone who sits, it is obviously courteous to pre-lower the seat for them, and I believe the LID should absolutely be lowered before flushing. But if you aren't going to do that, and you don't know that a sitter will be using it next, logically, it should be seen as equally courteous to lower the seat as required and raise it again after use. Defaulting to either position alone is to prioritize one group of users over another. What really matters is that you wash your hands well after touching the seat.", ">People should be closing the lid whenever they are done using the toilet\n\nWhich OP reminded him to do and he ISN'T doing. Lol she's NTA mate", "Yeah, like this dude has been doing it one way for 30 years, and she expects him to completely change in 2 weeks.", "Exactly! I am a woman and I always look at the toilet before I plop myself down onto it, even in the middle of the night, because you never know what could be there! Maybe someone shut the whole lid. Maybe the seat is up. Maybe a SPIDER is on the toilet seat!!! (Or where I live, may well be a snake in the toilet)\n\nI've never not looked at the toilet before sitting to use it. \n\nAlso,\n\n>but I really don\u2019t think I should have to touch a dirty toilet seat every time someone who doesn\u2019t even live here forgets to put it down\n\nYou're going to wash your hands after you go anyways, so what does it matter???", "If I pee sitting down I always dribble when I stand up and have to wipe piss off the floor. So there\u2019s that. Idk if it\u2019s just me. I\u2019ve tried not doing it, but I literally can\u2019t help it. Much easier to just stand\n\nEdit: who tf downvoted me? This is a real issue, and I\u2019m open to suggestions", "Same here, I thought I was reading the script of a South Park episode given the drama over such a non-issue.\n\nSeeing the comments immediately devolve it into misandry and a gender battle is both expected for Reddit and depressing for humanity.", "I agree, if you make a mess you clean it up, and I did learn that early in life.\n\nSo for me if I spray outside the bowl (which is major rarity) then I clean it up. If I go #2 I clean up after myself, and I teach my kids this, and I expect it of guests in my house. What I don\u2019t understand is what this has to do with a toilet seat.\n\nIf I am willing to clean up after myself if I make a mess, why is also beholden of me to make sure that the toilet seat is reset to its default position every time I use a toilet?\n\nBut to clarify, when I am in anyone\u2019s house but mine, I do put the seat down. I just don\u2019t understand the age old argument, and personally find it ridiculous.", "That has happened to me minus the laptop part.", "The LID should be down, just having the seat down accomplished next to nothing. Flushing the toilet, regardless of what number you did, lid goes down. The bonus is that nobody can complain about their preference for seat up/down not being followed.", "It takes about 5 gallons to flush a toilet.  It\u2019s a lot of water.   I pee many times a day.  It is immoral to flush the toilet every time you just pee if you live in a drought region.   \n\nAnd it\u2019s pretty easy to just, clean the toilet weekly and no stains?", "It is immoral to flush every time you pee if you live in a drought region.", "Just look before sitting down", "Thank you for parenting your boys well", "God, lid down every time you finish is the only way. The poop particles!", "That is a pet peeve of mine. It has a lid for a reason. Use it!", "It\u2019s the reason my toothbrush etc. isn\u2019t stored in my bathroom - I always put the lid down, but I\u2019m not the only one who uses that toilet."]}
