Why don't you put a sign on the wall that says remember to put the seat down. To help him remember. And everytime he leaves it up tell him and get him to put it down instead of doing it yourself. That way he can get into practice with putting it down. I have to get the guy  in my house to clean up pee they left on the toilet seat every time I find it. And since then its been happening way less often.

But anyways NTA, ur roomates a bit dramatic.", "NTA! \n\nIf he's that \"self conscious\" about it he'd remember to put it down to save him the embarrassment", "NTA. I don't really understand how he can say he's feeling self-conscious?

I\u2019m a man, and can\u2019t believe people are this stupid. Leave it the way you found it is the key.", "NTA. In my house both the seat and lid go down that way my son and I have to lift both and my wife only needs to lift the lid.

Seriously, it\u2019s not that difficult", "NTA If you don't set him straight, some other woman will. He sounds like a controlling AH by manipulating it into him being the victim by you embarrassing him. He could sit to pee and the problem would be solved.

I didn't say anything.  One did finally ask if that meant he should put the seat down.  I said it would be nice if he did, and if anyone forgot I'd be reminded that's its so nice to have a man around the house. \n\nAlso suggest a motion sensitive night light in the bathroom.", "NTA. He should respect the wishes of the house he's visiting, and it's not that hard, I also grew up with 2 brothers and no sisters and I always put the seat down. Mainly because I don't want the spray from flushing to get on everything.\n\n At the same time, look before you sit? I'm going to get downvoted for that, but looking before you sit on anything is just common sense. And it's just as easy as remembering to put the seat down.", "NTA - I'd try using duct tape to hold the seat down. The annoyance should get the point across after the first few times he tries to lift it and finds he has to sit down instead.", "NTA I always flush with the lid shut as toothbrushes are in there", "Everyone should close the toilet completely every time they use it, prior to flushing. The fact that he\u2019s just misting urine water all over your bathroom is awful.", "NTA\n\nGet a sign that tells people to put the seat down after they've put it up. That way you don't have to embarrass him by talking with him about it. He can just read the sign in the way it is the toilet. If he still can't remember to do it after you've put up a sign he's just being willfully incompetent.", "Nta. Sounds like the problem solved itself. Your roommate is a moron though.  I mean, how dare you ask people to respect your living space. The audacity", "A friend of mine had cats and house rule was if you left the seat up you were washing the cat that inevitably falls in....\n\nHaven't left the seat up since.\n\nOP's alternative is of course to rip out the existing toilet and replace it with a squat toilet so there is no lid.", "Wtf NTA. How can you be self-conscious if you're not conscious at all about what you're doing? It's a shared bathroom where everyone that lives there sits on the toilet. You addressed the issue with him respectfully and he agreed to try to be more aware. How does forgetting every time since then constitute trying?", "NTA. Putting the seat down is the MINIMUM", "Nta. If my small child can do it, this grown man can.", "NTA  I used to live with a JNSO and he NEVER put the seat down, and even screamed at me when it made noise when I would gingerly, with two fingers, put the seat down and it would slip out of my hands.. one night at 3 a.m., I didn't realize the seat was up, slipped, and busted my temple on the corner of the counter.  Blood everywhere. He screamed at me that I woke him up. Sorry if your problem sounds like it's all about me, but it can become a real safety issue. Needless to say, I no longer live there.", "NTA my best friends bf did this constantly. The problem solved itself when I refused to put it down after him and one night he fell into the toilet bowl", "NTA - he\u2019s a guest\u2026 he needs to respect your space since you\u2019re the one living there, not him. how does he get self conscious over that? it\u2019s not hard to put it down.", "Nta.  If you use something that isn't yours, you return it how you found it as a courtesy.  So it's down when he goes in but doesn't think to put it back? Bullshit he's just lazy.  That and the fact that it is fucking disgusting to flush a toilet with the lid open.  Tell his gf to Google that.", "Yta. Your comment about almost falling in makes me think you don't close the lid to the toilet at all, you just expect the seat down. Why the double standards about not touching a dirty toilet seat? If the toilet seat is so dirty it can't be touched why would you expect a guest to touch it twice, once to put it up and once to put it down. Clean your dirty toilet.  And keep the lid closed.", "ESH. Everyone should be putting the toilet seat AND LID down, which sounds like none of you are.

If you have to shift the goalposts to make your point, you didn't make your point.", "ESH.\n\nHe sucks for not making an effort.  Who cares if he grew up in a house full of guys, he's going to have to learn to not be gross at some point.  Close the thing you piss and shit in when you're not pissing or shitting in it.\n\nYou suck for sitting on the toilet blindly and the complaining about it as if it's someone else's fault that you're oblivious to the world around you.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t even live there!  When my now husband first moved in with me I told him that the toilet lid was to remain down when not in use, and that was non negotiable.  There has never been a problem besides the one time the cat tried to jump up while the hubs was peeing and landed in the toilet.  Fun times.", "All children grow up *not* used to doing things, and then they learn as an adult. Does he manage to drive, get up for work, pay his bills, shave, cook for himself? Things he didn't do himself growing up? Then he can also adapt to putting the seat down when asked by the occupants of the house. It just sounds like he doesn't think being considerate to you is important enough to him.", "Sounds like you ran piss-boy off. NTA", "NTA! I had this same issue but with a couple of coworkers. Scolded them every time, in front of other employees and they finally caught on.\n\nIf I were you, I'd loudly slam the seat down just to make a point after asking him the couple of times. Petty, but maybe the annoying and startling sound of closing it however many times a day would get him to stop.", "ESH, I personally always put the lid down. It\u2019s gross that you guys even leave the lid up. I agree he\u2019s the AH for acting weird about it and not working with you guys. But seriously you almost fell in? Lmao I always thought girls were joking about that. Like what would have happened in he put the lid down? You would just go all over the lid because you didn\u2019t check it yourself? Like cmon, really? And you\u2019re complaining about the \u201cdirty toilet seat\u201d so do you not flush either? Because that isn\u2019t clean either.", "NTA.  No excuse is good enough.  He is not at home and his girlfriend has female roommates.  She can choose to be a pick me and take his disregard, bit not everyone has to fll in line.\n\nJust ugh, 30 and no home training.  His poor mom.", "ESH, I will never understand the toilet seat thing. It's truly not something I care about at all, and I would be bewildered if someone approached me about it.", "YTA ....not a big deal. Once in a while you have to put it down... Really? It isn't hard!", "Hopefully, he sticks to his word because being held accountable for his actions is too traumatizing.

You can call her to the bathroom to be his toilet maid then.\r  \n\r\n\nI like the way you think. \ud83d\ude02 And I agree with everything else in your comment. Homeboy just needs to put on his big boy panties and learn to put the seat down.", "Kayla straight doesn't get a say as long as her bf keeps being disrespectful of the people who actually live there.

It\u2019s gross!!!", "Right, he should be ashamed at 30 that he's not house trained.", "I agree with you, but it does not seem to be a Lid down household.  She mentioned she almost fell in at 3am, if it was a lid closed household she would have needed to lift the lid to use it, instead she just sat down.", "I live by myself and even close the lid every time I use the bathroom. It's not hard.", "But it's not required to lift the seat, it's as easy to pee sitting down as standing.

You don't shit standing while the seat is up, so you need the seat down at least some of the time. So menfolk should put it down. I don't understand why men think the toilet revolves around them and their needs.", "Weird vote, considering you\u2019re actually agreeing with OP", "I myself like the lid closed because I don't like my bathroom sprayed with a fine mist of feces and urine.", "Its not the lid, its the seat itself he never puts down.

Stop embarrassing guests in your home over something so stupid.", "What surprise are you referring to? I don\u2019t want him to put the seat down but leave the lid up.

We'd have to come up with a very awkward seated position in order for our genitals to actually touch the seat itself. As for touching it with your hand, think about how often you touch your face on an average day. Little things like scratching the tip of your nose when it itches, resting your chin in the palm of your hand, covering up a yawn or a cough, rubbing your eyes if you're a bit tired, shifting some hair out of your eyes, I could go on and on. There are so many tiny actions like this that we don't think about. Any and all of these could happen while you are sitting on the toilet. Yes, it's all well and good to say, \"Well, just make sure you don't touch your face while you're in there.\" But sometimes, you do one of those things without thinking. They're so commonplace, so ingrained into our brains, that they just sort of happen at times. And if you've touched a germ-infested toilet seat beforehand? Boom, you just exposed yourself.", "Are you a woman who has ever sat on a toilet seat?

I agree with the other commenter. Girlfriend can follow up homeboy in the bathroom to wipe the pee drips and splash radius around the toilet. We *all* know his aim is bad.

Not sitting down to pee is rude, unsanitary and primitive. The pee splashes everywhere.", "It's not even a need. They can sit to pee. It's a rule in my house because I'm not cleaning piss splatters. Everyone sits every time, regardless of their bits. Toilets are urinals are not the same and are not meant to be used in the same way.

Everybody else puts the lid down but your complaint was that you sat on the bare porcelain in the night without checking... but surely you would have had to check if the lid is down.\n\nEnd of the day it's probably just a cultural thing.
