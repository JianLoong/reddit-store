My parents divorced when I was 12yrs old. My mom married my step dad when I was 14 and my dad just married my stepmom early last year. My stepmom mom and her 16yr old daughter moved into my father's home about three weeks before their wedding.\n\nAnyways, my bio mom cash apped me some money. I was sitting in my room when I called her to thank her for the money and apparently, my step sister heard my conversation. She asked me to share and I told her no since it wasn't even much anyway. She got upset and stormed off.\n\nFew minutes later my step mom came into my room and demanded that I give my step sister some of my money. I told her no and that it was given to me by my TRUE mother. I also said that how's about she give her daughter some money since she's the mother and cares so much about her child not having money. She told me that I need to learn how to stop being selfish and share. I told her I don't have to share a darn thing. She threatened to tell my father so I flipped her off and she left my room upset.\n\nI don't get along with my stepmom as well as my step sister. Since these two came into our lives they done nothing but tried to give me the short end of the stick. One time my step sister tried to make my dad spend some of my school's field trip money on a set of $40 headphones since her other one broke. Luckily I convinced him not to do it. Of course she was mad. Then there was this time my stepmom got mad at my dad for taking me to my father/daughter dance instead of staying at home to spend time with her. She was pissed off about that... \n\nBut you guys tell me if I'm TA or not about the recent situation.", "created_utc": 1681881649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rhzto/aita_for_flipping_my_step_mother_off_after_she/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope you tell your mom about the stepmother's behavior, it is unacceptable.", "NTA. But you might want to take a higher road from here on out when this b.s. happens in the future. If you firmly stand up for yourself without being disrespectful, the horrible behavior of the stepmother and her daughter will stand out and hopefully be more obvious to your father. Good luck.", "NTA.\nGods, your step mom is a piece of work. She is obviously the source of your step sisters BS.\nYour step sister is not entitled to any of your belongings or money. That's plain stupid.\nIf she's so hard up for cash she can ask her father, presumably if he's alive or if there's contact.\nI'd say try to talk to your dad?\nIf your dad doesn't know the BS they pull on you, definitely have a heart to heart with him. And it's not teenage drama, it's his step child being a greedy, selfish butt.\nOr consider living with your mom if possible.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s your money that your biological mom gave you. No one else has any rights to it. Constantly asking you to share was the asshole move.", "NTA, but yeah flipping her off was a little much & then just puts you in the position to be in the wrong too. Ridiculous she asked you to share as though you're children playing blocks or dolls though. Like you said, your mom gave it to you, why can't she give money to her daughter? Lol. Sounds manipulative.", "NTA - Flipping off isn't great but I am confused by the logic of the stepmum. Yes siblings should share, but should stepsiblings share something that was given by someone who only one of the step siblings live with part time? That seems absurd to me.", "NTA", "NTA, as a parent of toddlers, I don\u2019t even force them to share between them, I suggest, and if not the other one learn a little bit about handling frustration. Clearly your step mom needs some boundaries and little less entitlement.", "NTA.\n\nYour stepmom and stepsis are greedy and entitled.", "NTA. But not a good idea to flip people off. Especially ones who have the means to make your life unpleasant. I don\u2019t understand why they feel entitled to funds earmarked for you. Is your mom in a better position financially than your dad?", "NTA and keep your phone password protected so stepsis doesnt try to access your cashapp.", "What is wrong with your dad that you had to convince him not to spend your field trip money on her?

But make sure your bio mom knows what your stepmother is doing. That money is yours and they can't take it from you. Yta for flipping her off though. Be mature and be the higher one here.

Your step-mother has no right to demand you give anything of your's to your step-sister.", "NTA\n\nYour stepmom and stepsis are AHs for trying to get their grubby fingers in YOUR money.\n\nIf your father takes their side, then he\u2019s AH, too, and the action is definitely financial abuse that you should really tell your mom about.\n\nGood luck and don\u2019t let the AHs ruin your day.", "NTA, but you have to tell your Dad about their entitlement, because your mum will loose her shit about this when you tell her.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even fathom the logic that money given to you by your mother must be shared with your father\u2019s step-daughter. The pair of them sound like grubby gold diggers.", "Nta\nYou don't have to share anything with them, especially if given by other parent. \nI am sorry you are in this situation.", "You\u2019re NTA, but please be aware you handled the situation in the most assholish way possible.", "NTA for refusing to share your money. You are TA for the way you responded though. It sounds like you two have a rough history unfortunately, but you sound like you tried to turn it into a fight too. The TRUE mother line was unnecessary. In the future saying, \u201cNo I will not share the money my mom gave me.\u201d is enough. When she said she was going to tell your dad you should have responded that you would be telling your mom so she can put a stop to these unreasonable requests. Take the high road with your stepmom in the future, yes it can be hard, but it\u2019s worth it to not stoop to that level too. \nI say this as someone with kids around your age who recently had a serious issue with my own stepmom. It was at the end of spending around 3 hours with them and she lectured me on my parenting in an area where she had no clue about the full story. I took a deep breath and said that she didn\u2019t understand the full situation and dropped it. Then I let it sit for a full week before sending a very detailed message to her and my dad explaining the full situation because responding in anger wouldn\u2019t have done any of us a bit of good. To add insult to injury I have professional experience in the area she was criticizing me on too, and she has no background in related issues at all. \nMy advice from my own experience, is to give yourself a cooling off period. After you no longer want to punch someone over this then work on your reply. Send your dad an email or even give him a paper letter asking him to consider you in this. Tell him that it\u2019s completely unfair for you to be asked to share money from your mom with your stepsister. You can even come up with a line of where you\u2019re willing to share (a big bag of candy or a family size bag of chips would be reasonable things to ask you to share with others, but money from your mom isn\u2019t a reasonable ask). You\u2019re more likely to get your dad to see your side and support you if you give him a calm and rational explanation. You are probably going to have to apologize for flipping her off though in order to settle things with your dad. No matter how much you hate her she\u2019s still his wife and it\u2019s her house so he\u2019ll probably expect that, which you\u2019ll obviously hate doing.", "for flipping someone off?
