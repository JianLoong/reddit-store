You are TA for the way you responded though. It sounds like you two have a rough history unfortunately, but you sound like you tried to turn it into a fight too. The TRUE mother line was unnecessary. In the future saying, \u201cNo I will not share the money my mom gave me.\u201d is enough. When she said she was going to tell your dad you should have responded that you would be telling your mom so she can put a stop to these unreasonable requests. Take the high road with your stepmom in the future, yes it can be hard, but it\u2019s worth it to not stoop to that level too. \nI say this as someone with kids around your age who recently had a serious issue with my own stepmom. It was at the end of spending around 3 hours with them and she lectured me on my parenting in an area where she had no clue about the full story. I took a deep breath and said that she didn\u2019t understand the full situation and dropped it. Then I let it sit for a full week before sending a very detailed message to her and my dad explaining the full situation because responding in anger wouldn\u2019t have done any of us a bit of good. To add insult to injury I have professional experience in the area she was criticizing me on too, and she has no background in related issues at all. \nMy advice from my own experience, is to give yourself a cooling off period. After you no longer want to punch someone over this then work on your reply. Send your dad an email or even give him a paper letter asking him to consider you in this. Tell him that it\u2019s completely unfair for you to be asked to share money from your mom with your stepsister. You can even come up with a line of where you\u2019re willing to share (a big bag of candy or a family size bag of chips would be reasonable things to ask you to share with others, but money from your mom isn\u2019t a reasonable ask). You\u2019re more likely to get your dad to see your side and support you if you give him a calm and rational explanation. You are probably going to have to apologize for flipping her off though in order to settle things with your dad. No matter how much you hate her she\u2019s still his wife and it\u2019s her house so he\u2019ll probably expect that, which you\u2019ll obviously hate doing.", "for flipping someone off?
