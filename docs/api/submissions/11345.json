I got into a top school and almost paid nothing (even though tuition was 50k a year) for a bachelor's and masters because I _knew_ if I wanted a shot in this field I had to be better than the men. In any STEM field women simply do not have the luxury of being average.\n\nIt's totally possible your sister was under qualified. It's also extremely possible someone in admissions was sexist. I remember my first job I had gotten- someone else from my same school also got the job. We had the same degree, same GPA, did all the same extra curriculars. Except I had more awards and a minor AND I was just accepted into my masters program FOR FREE because my resume was awesome. He got paid more.\n\nYears later I got another job and had another male peer. This time I had a year more of experience and a masters degree the other peer did not have. Guess who was paid more? Not me.\n\nWhat's unfortunate for your sister is- she will never really know. Maybe she truly wasn't qualified. Maybe someone saw that she did cheerleading or something else feminine and thought \"not cut out for computer science\". It's unfortunate. \n\nAnyway I'll get off my soap box- congrats on getting into an awesome program! It sucks your sister couldn't be happy for you even though she had to be disappointed. Give her a little grace- if she pursues computer science it will be harder for her than it is for you.

Not getting into the school of your choice is a difficult and upsetting situation, and your sister had reason to be bothered by the fact that you were accepted to a school that she wanted to go to.  You also did chose to escalate when she lashed out.  I understand that lashing out is wrong, but she was reasonably upset and you chose to respond in kind instead of kindly.\n\nYour sister should not have lashed out.  You being accepted had nothing to do with her not being accepted, and you had no sway in the decision on her acceptance, so she had no right to be mad at you.  Just because she was reasonably upset, does not mean that she should take it out on you.  I agree that she should have left and cried elsewhere or maybe pulled one of your parents aside for support.\n\nYou were both out of line.  Your parents should have stepped in a bit sooner.  One of them should have taken her away from the situation and helped her deal with her overwhelming emotions, while the other stayed with you to process your joy.  Their slow reaction allowed this escalation to occur.\n\nThis is your family.  Please understand that they're never going to be perfect, but they are the family that you have.  Your sister is hurting right now.  I'm glad you were accepted into the school of your choice.  Please have some sympathy for your sister, who did not.", "That's a shit situation to be in.
