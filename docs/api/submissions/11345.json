I got into a top school and almost paid nothing (even though tuition was 50k a year) for a bachelor's and masters because I _knew_ if I wanted a shot in this field I had to be better than the men. In any STEM field women simply do not have the luxury of being average.\n\nIt's totally possible your sister was under qualified. It's also extremely possible someone in admissions was sexist. I remember my first job I had gotten- someone else from my same school also got the job. We had the same degree, same GPA, did all the same extra curriculars. Except I had more awards and a minor AND I was just accepted into my masters program FOR FREE because my resume was awesome. He got paid more.\n\nYears later I got another job and had another male peer. This time I had a year more of experience and a masters degree the other peer did not have. Guess who was paid more? Not me.\n\nWhat's unfortunate for your sister is- she will never really know. Maybe she truly wasn't qualified. Maybe someone saw that she did cheerleading or something else feminine and thought \"not cut out for computer science\". It's unfortunate. \n\nAnyway I'll get off my soap box- congrats on getting into an awesome program! It sucks your sister couldn't be happy for you even though she had to be disappointed. Give her a little grace- if she pursues computer science it will be harder for her than it is for you.

Not getting into the school of your choice is a difficult and upsetting situation, and your sister had reason to be bothered by the fact that you were accepted to a school that she wanted to go to.  You also did chose to escalate when she lashed out.  I understand that lashing out is wrong, but she was reasonably upset and you chose to respond in kind instead of kindly.\n\nYour sister should not have lashed out.  You being accepted had nothing to do with her not being accepted, and you had no sway in the decision on her acceptance, so she had no right to be mad at you.  Just because she was reasonably upset, does not mean that she should take it out on you.  I agree that she should have left and cried elsewhere or maybe pulled one of your parents aside for support.\n\nYou were both out of line.  Your parents should have stepped in a bit sooner.  One of them should have taken her away from the situation and helped her deal with her overwhelming emotions, while the other stayed with you to process your joy.  Their slow reaction allowed this escalation to occur.\n\nThis is your family.  Please understand that they're never going to be perfect, but they are the family that you have.  Your sister is hurting right now.  I'm glad you were accepted into the school of your choice.  Please have some sympathy for your sister, who did not.", "That's a shit situation to be in.

No, it's not likely that would be her very first reaction and anyone with an ounce of empathy wouldn't have said that anyone should be going and crying in the bathroom of their own home.", "Lower grades than OP doesn't mean too low for the program though. American grading goes over my head but OP could be a AAAAA student while sis is a AAAAB student. But if the course entry requirements are only AAABB then she's been rejected on different grounds. \n\nI'd argue however that applying early probably wasn't the wisest choice - again no idea about American education systems but I feel like you probably needed TOP grades to get in early", "Don\u2019t make up answers.", "Not saying that OP's an asshole.\n\nBut it could be that Op's sister had lower grades, and generally, a lower quality application, because her high school teachers were sexists. Or because society is sexist.\n\nMaybe her high school teachers graded her more harshly on account of her gender? Maybe OP was more encouraged to do well in his STEM classes because his teachers were more encouraging towards male students, possibly in very subtle ways. Maybe their high school teachers don't even know the subtle ways that sexism shows up in their teaching.\n\nMale students do typically have better SAT scores. (I literally read it in a text book today) Is it sexist to use the SAT as an admissions criteria when male students generally do better than female students on the SAT? Mayhaps.\n\nGenerally, women are stereotyped as not being good at math, and that kind of stereotyping can be discouraging to female students from a young age. Teachers even have an implicit bias that girls have a lower mathematical ability than boys. (This also could account for some of the achievement gap in those SAT scores).\n\n[https://news.usc.edu/trojan-family/girls-learn-math-bias-gender-ability-stem/#:\\~:text=Their%20struggles%20with%20math%20are,with%20the%20same%20incorrect%20solutions](https://news.usc.edu/trojan-family/girls-learn-math-bias-gender-ability-stem/#:~:text=Their%20struggles%20with%20math%20are,with%20the%20same%20incorrect%20solutions).\n\nLike, I don't think OP is an asshole, but I feel badly for his twin. My take is that OP should acknowledge that he does have male privilege. But his sister shouldn't be taking out her frustrations on OP, and she shouldn't be accusing OP of \"stealing her spot.\"\n\nNow, I'm not saying OP didn't work hard to get into the program. But I am saying that he has had male privilege his entire life, and his sister hasn't.", "If what he said about her grades is true, he should have left it at that.\n\nMentioning an irrelevant statistic is unhelpful at best. Saying that a larger percentage of female applicants get accepted adds nothing to the conversation and, to me at least, sounds like he's voicing a grievance. To make matters worse, the statistic itself doesn't provide any evidence of bias one way or the other.\n\nSo it's just a talking point to either vent his anger or upset his sister. Or both.", "There\u2019s entry requirements and then there\u2019s if they only accept 100 candidates that round and there are 100 candidates with AAAAA grades, then sister with AAAAB won\u2019t make the cut.\n\nOf course it\u2019s not that simple. Colleges also look at community service, other interests and activities, essays that talk about their passion etc."]}
