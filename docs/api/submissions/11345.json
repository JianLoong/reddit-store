NTA", "ESH\n\nI'm a woman in Cyber Security and I have been in the field for 10 years. I got into a top school and almost paid nothing (even though tuition was 50k a year) for a bachelor's and masters because I _knew_ if I wanted a shot in this field I had to be better than the men. In any STEM field women simply do not have the luxury of being average.\n\nIt's totally possible your sister was under qualified. It's also extremely possible someone in admissions was sexist. I remember my first job I had gotten- someone else from my same school also got the job. We had the same degree, same GPA, did all the same extra curriculars. Except I had more awards and a minor AND I was just accepted into my masters program FOR FREE because my resume was awesome. He got paid more.\n\nYears later I got another job and had another male peer. This time I had a year more of experience and a masters degree the other peer did not have. Guess who was paid more? Not me.\n\nWhat's unfortunate for your sister is- she will never really know. Maybe she truly wasn't qualified. Maybe someone saw that she did cheerleading or something else feminine and thought \"not cut out for computer science\". It's unfortunate. \n\nAnyway I'll get off my soap box- congrats on getting into an awesome program! It sucks your sister couldn't be happy for you even though she had to be disappointed. Give her a little grace- if she pursues computer science it will be harder for her than it is for you. Not academically- but she will have people tell her over and over she isn't capable because of what she looks like. It'll hurt and be shitty but she can do it just like you can!", "NTA, I know it's sucks getting rejected by a school when you're a teenager, and everything is the end of the world, lol\n\nBUT.....if you don't make the cut, you just don't make the cut.

In reality, I knew he was lazy and prioritizing gaming with friends over his studies...and he failed as a direct result.", "NTA\n\nHighly unlikely your sister was not accepted because of her gender considering that higher ed institutions are pushing for greater involvement in STEM subjects for females", "NTA. She chose to make a scene and you replied with the facts.

Your sister sounds like a brat who doesn\u2019t want to accept she can\u2019t have everything her way.", "NTA\n\nI feel like she wants to play the sexist card to feel like a victim.

It's not sexism. \ud83e\udd23 NTA but good luck.", "NTA. Maybe the school will give her a participation trophy for applying. Seriously, she needs to learn deal with failure and rejection.

The truth can't be cruel.", "I'm going to say soft ESH. I mean, you're Correct, but I don't think that makes you not an asshole. I know she hurt your feelings by being dramatic, but to be fair, I think you kind of knew what effect you were going to have on her. She should be happy for you, and not have made those remarks, but she wasn't capable of it.\n\nYour parents are generally right in that you could have ignored her instead of saying something you can't really take back. \n\nI don't know your sister, or the depths of what your relationship is like, but maybe this would be an opportunity for you both to extend each other a little grace.", "NTA - if everything else were equal, they\u2019d honestly probably select her over you, if they\u2019re looking at diversity within that field. Unless there\u2019s an external, gender-based reason her grades and test scores are lower - like your parents sent you to two different private schools and hers didn\u2019t teach math very well. Even then, that\u2019s on your parents, not on you.\n\nMaybe you said things in ways that could have been kinder, but you\u2019ll develop that skill.  It wouldn\u2019t hurt to type out a text or email to her acknowledging her disappointment on not being accepted to her dream school. That mode of communication will give you time to find the right words and not have to think on the fly.\n\nDid she apply in general admission? I\u2019m an Old, but back when I was applying to colleges, only the exceptional students got early admission offers. If you got passed over at that stage, you could let them know if you wanted to be considered in general admission.", "ESH.  I get that you're upset that she was distraught when you were announcing your acceptance. This was your moment and she ruined it.  *However*, you had to have known that this would upset her.  You could have given her a heads up ahead of time or talked to your parents without her present and come to a solution with them on how to approach it with her.  Not getting into the school of your choice is a difficult and upsetting situation, and your sister had reason to be bothered by the fact that you were accepted to a school that she wanted to go to.  You also did chose to escalate when she lashed out.  I understand that lashing out is wrong, but she was reasonably upset and you chose to respond in kind instead of kindly.\n\nYour sister should not have lashed out.  You being accepted had nothing to do with her not being accepted, and you had no sway in the decision on her acceptance, so she had no right to be mad at you.  Just because she was reasonably upset, does not mean that she should take it out on you.  I agree that she should have left and cried elsewhere or maybe pulled one of your parents aside for support.\n\nYou were both out of line.  Your parents should have stepped in a bit sooner.  One of them should have taken her away from the situation and helped her deal with her overwhelming emotions, while the other stayed with you to process your joy.  Their slow reaction allowed this escalation to occur.\n\nThis is your family.  Please understand that they're never going to be perfect, but they are the family that you have.  Your sister is hurting right now.  I'm glad you were accepted into the school of your choice.  Please have some sympathy for your sister, who did not.", "That's a shit situation to be in. You're NTA for telling the truth. But, no one is going to appreciate it or be on your side publicly even if anyone in the family agrees with you. Realistically, your parents should have stepped in immediately and mitigated the situation instead of letting her go on a rant.", ">Also, this school\u2019s computer science program has a significantly higher acceptance rate for female applicants.\n\nINFO: Do they accept a higher quantity of female than male applicants? Or just a higher percentage?\n\nMIT, Harvey Mudd, CalTech, and Carnegie Mellon all accept a much higher percentage of female applicants than male. Despite that, none of them have more female students than male ones. Harvey Mudd and Carnegie Mellon are roughly 50/50, but MIT and CalTech have more male students than female.\n\nIf the school you're referring to is similar, your statistic is irrelevant.

She is being sexist to say men are not skilful and only reach places they want because of their gender.", "YTA, but only because of your timing.

If you were my kid, I would have congratulated you, said you were just out of line, but you were still right. Your sister just needs to come to terms that people don\u2019t get competitive slots because they really want them. They get those competitive slots because they work hard for them.", "ESH- listen, you knew the news would upset her.

If you had to break the news all over again, it may have been better to have told your parents first. They could have celebrated with you privately and then they could have told her privately. She would have had her pity party without you bearing its brunt. Ultimately, I would also include them in ESH because they should have intervened before you had a chance to tell your sister to get over herself. I mean, even my seven-year-old knows that if her big feelings are disruptive, she has to have them in another room no matter how valid they are. She also knows not to yuck someone else\u2019s yum. So there\u2019s something of a parenting fail in your situation.\n\nI hope your sister\u2019s ego and your relationship can recover in the months you still have left in the same home.

If you had just left the situation alone, let her go off on the situation, then she would have eventually gotten past it.  Yes she diminished your ability to get in when she didn't.
