They\u2019re also more expensive than an expensive dinner.

She's 27 and letting her friends kill her joy over a date plan that was her idea.", "Absolutely NTA! It's not childish either, plenty of adults like amusement parks including me.

This is going to be a bigger issue down the road if you don\u2019t discuss it and work on it now. Also, amusement parks are very expensive nowadays.. I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019d end up spending just as much there if not more than at a fancy restaurant (if her friends think lack of money is a motivation), even though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just their way to look down on you since you\u2019re younger than her since she said \u201cchildish things\u201d.", "NTA \u2014 I'm sorry that you find yourself in this situation.

Then says your an awful man and thinking of yourself? \n\nYour girlfriend is doing more than just \"following\". She's changing her plans and conveniently altering the truth of who's desire it was to go to the amusement park in the first place. And then she's making a personal attack against you by placing blame and calling you an awful dude....this is toxic. \n\nDon't apologize to her, or for her. She's the one who owes an apology.  Consider very carefully if you want to invest more time into a relationship with someone so weak willed and straight up abusive.

You should be apologizing for calling her friends names, even though it\u2019s true. You know she is depressed so you coming at her like everyone else does will do nothing but hurt her more. She is getting pulled in all directions because she doesn\u2019t know how to let toxic people go. \n\nHer friends are the assholes though for diminishing the light she has for the small things in life. Them killing her excitement over anything that they find isn\u2019t up to their standards is just pathetic. You should still take her to the amusement park even if she is depressed because she will figure out that her friends were wrong and amusement parks are great.", "NTA. What kind of idiot says it\u2019s childish and bad to go to an amusement park? Hell, my Aunt and Uncle (both in like, their late 40s/early 50s) still go to friggin Disneyland together.", "Half way there. Your timing was crap, though you are probably correct.", "I\u2019m inclined to say a mild ESH.\n\nShe\u2019s a follower, and a particularly insecure, immature type of follower who hasn\u2019t figured out what she likes or wants on her own.  You need to have a good think about whether that\u2019s someone you can be happy with.\n\nMy husband is also a bit of a follower, but the more secure type.  He knows what he likes and isn\u2019t afraid to like unpopular things, but he\u2019s also very laid back and open to experiences, so he\u2019s happy to let others (mostly me) make a lot of the decisions, because he\u2019ll be happy either way.  Amusement park or nice restaurant?  He\u2019ll enjoy either one, so usually I pick.\n\nHaving said that, you were harsh with her.  Someone like that needs you to build her up to have the confidence to like what she likes, not be torn down.

This is something that is going to take time and effort, but it's what she needs to do to grow into herself as a person. \n\nHer current attitude is a defensive posture taken to avoid doing this because acknowledging the real issue is painful and running away seems easier.

This is going to continue to annoy you and her family and friends aren\u2019t going anywhere", "TLDR: Girlfriend - An amusement park is a fun date. A very acceptable, normal mature adult activity (As a person eligible to join the AARP, I kind of resent the implication that they aren't.) Try a little bit of everything, not just eating at expensive restaurants. Do things you and your boyfriend have each always wanted to do. Accept that you and your friends and family are not carbon copies of each other. You like things that they don't and vice-versa and that is OKAY and NORMAL. At one point in my life I would have given a LOT to have someone in my life that made sure I got to try the things I hadn't done but wanted to do. \n\nI am sorry this is so long. The topic just really resonates with me. \n\nI am also over 50 years old. No kids. I own ponies. I play video games every day. I love cartoons; I stream SpongeBob SquarePants or Fairly OddParents every night so my brain stops going 90 miles an hour and I can sleep. Okay, also the Great British Bake Off. When I lived close enough to one, I went to Six Flags multiple times every year. I love the Marvel Universe. I am still angry about the state of the DCU.\n\nNow that I have severe social anxiety I can't enjoy some of the 'childish' public activities that I used to really enjoy. Such as State Fairs with rides and crazy food and tons of exhibits. Renaissance fairs. Blockbuster superhero special effects extravaganza movies at the theater opening night. Silly animated movies on a weekend matinee so I can enjoy both the movie and the kids in the audience reacting to it. SciFi-fantasy conventions with Cosplay. Putt-putt, especially after a heavy rain when everyone will play lousy because of all the puddles. I miss these things. And I also miss live theater and concerts and other 'mature' stuff.\n\nMessage to your girlfriend: I know what it is like to grow apart from friends and family who are important to you but lately just leave you feeling down after you see or talk to them. Because your roads are branching away from each other. But you want to keep them in your life so you let go of the things you like about yourself but they don't. And that road goes back to staying one lane when what you really wanted to do is ride the Tail of the Dragon with the top down and the radio blasting.\n\nYou can do all the adulting activities and still have fun doing things others might consider immature. You care about your friends and their opinions but you are different people at the end of it all. You don't like all the same foods, the same drinks and you haven't all had the same experiences. \n\nGo to the amusement park. You'll see (especially at night) other young adult couples with no kids on dates there. You'll share cotton candy. Drive the bumper cars. Kiss each other on the Ferris wheel. Ride the roller coasters. Have fun. \n\nIt won't be the same experience that your friends would have there and that is okay. Your boyfriend is not a... Well, whatever your friends think he is. He doesn't want to take you to the amusement park because he is childish or cheap. He wants to give you something that you have never experienced but have always wanted to try. Anybody can take you to an expensive restaurant. But how boring would expensive restaurants be if you ate out every night? \n\nAfter the amusement park, you can find an 'adult' activity neither of you have done and try it. Live local theater is usually entertaining and pretty cheap. You can adult and be mature without spending a fortune and still have a good time. You and your boyfriend could pick a foreign language to learn.  You can use Duolingo, which is free, and practice on each other. \n\nVery soon- if not now -you will find holiday performances of the Nutcracker ballet almost everywhere. You might enjoy it. I like it. If you like music and can find it, a performance by a full symphony of Handel's Messiah is just... parts of it just give me goosebumps (in a good way). I understand the TransSiberian Orchestra is touring right now. Their holiday music is especially amazing.\n\nGo out to a 'mature event' like those above a handful of times and I bet you that you'll have acquired a whole lot more culture and adulting street cred than these friends and family actually have. You might find something you enjoy enough to repeat and in doing so find a new hobby. Or you might not but you will have had the experience of it. \n\nI have begun to think that successful adulting is mostly just figuring out the things that make you happy and then doing them.", "My gran used to LOVE going on rides with me.  I got dragged around the rides more by her than anyone else.\n\nOP I can tell you with 100% certainty that deep in her heart she still really wants to go.  Change tack and tell her that YOU desperately want to go.  BEG her to let you go and come with you.  Ask her to fake enjoyment for your sake.  Promise her that next time you can do something Grown Up for her like go to the ballet.  That way she can go do something she's always wanted to and enjoy herself without ever having to admit to her friends that she had fun.  Bonus points if you go to the ballet too, because it's amazing.", "Went to Europapark together with my bf and another couple and the boys decided they wanted to ride a coaster called Blue Fire.

Telling your partner you're excited to be attending something she's not done before, making plans for it, and then doing a 180 and resorting to name calling, emotional manipulation and demands for expensive restaurants because a group of bullies mocked her is far more childish than amusement parks will ever be. \n\nSaying she won't be happy being dependent on herd mentality, although true, smells of resentment too.
