I will let you know when I reach it.", "This isn't going to get better. She can't think for herself much less stick by her own decisions. And you put 3 years into this? Oh dude. You have the rest of your life to be happy and you choose someone who can't express individuality much less do what she wants.\n\nNTA", "40 year old who LOVES amusement parks here! 100% NTA your girlfriend needs to live her life for her or she is going to be pretty miserable.", "This is a relationship you need to walk from. They sell beer and cocktails at Disneyland for couples who just want to have a little fun.", "NTA,\n\nYour girlfriend needs new friends or needs to have a serious think/discussion about her value and worth. Having friends is amazing but if they are mocking what you as a person enjoy or might enjoy or they are downplaying the significance of a event, place or emotion, I think they aren't the kind of friends worth having.", "First, it's \"herd mentality\" ... as in, going along with the herd. \n\nI'm learning toward NTA, because she sounds *really* difficult to be with. That said, it does sound harsh, what you said you said. I don't think the friends put you in this mess ... you've chosen to stay in this relationship, knowing you your GF can vacillate in her responses.", "NTA. But if you decide to continue dating her, you will continue to deal with this. \n\nYou have to decide how much you can handle.", "NTA. Your girlfriend berated you for doing something nice. \n\nAlso, \u201cherd\u201d.", "NTA, same age as your gf and I would love to go to an amusement park! If she's the type of person who never takes responsibility and can't even think for herself and what she wants I would move on.", "NTA. Could have said it better but your point is totally valid. She's going to miss out on something she was excited for because of what other people think. That's terrible.", "NTA \n\nAmusement parks are AWESOME dates. Wtf? They\u2019re also more expensive than an expensive dinner. So again, wtf?\n\nYou might need to have a talk about boundaries with her otherwise those friends/family will continue making your life hell. She\u2019s free to act as she wants, doesn\u2019t mean you have to take it.", "NTA but this is not behavior you should have to put up with from an adult partner. She's unfairly blaming you for her own problems - and she has really big problems (kind of sad, too).  I wouldn't stay in this relationship if she doesn't recognize how difficult she's being.", "OMG.\n\nI have grandkids, and I think amusement parks are awesome.\n\nIs your gf really ready for a relationship? You might think about that, because that behavior may never change.", "NTA\n\nI would have blown her off and taken a different chick.", "That sounds incredibly exhausting. NTA. She sounds very immature for 27. Does she see the issue normally in how she reacts or does she pretend like this issue doesn't exist?", "NTA\n\nYou need a better girlfriend.   She's 27 and letting her friends kill her joy over a date plan that was her idea.", "Absolutely NTA! It's not childish either, plenty of adults like amusement parks including me. I'd be worried that her friends opinions seem to mean so much more to her then yours. She really shouldn't blow up on you when you were doing exactly what she wanted", "NTA. But your GF sounds too immature to be in a relationship. Literally.", "NTA\u2026 I\u2019d be upset if I\u2019d planned to do something nice and thoughtful (even if it was her suggestion to begin with) that I thought my SO would enjoy only to receive that reaction. \n\nI think your wording was a bit harsh but I think lack of communication is the real issue here. This is going to be a bigger issue down the road if you don\u2019t discuss it and work on it now. Also, amusement parks are very expensive nowadays.. I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019d end up spending just as much there if not more than at a fancy restaurant (if her friends think lack of money is a motivation), even though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just their way to look down on you since you\u2019re younger than her since she said \u201cchildish things\u201d.", "NTA \u2014 I'm sorry that you find yourself in this situation.  Your 27 year old adult girlfriend is behaving in a very concerning way. After all the effort to accommodate the wish for her to visit an amusement park, she was deterred by her AH friends? And then went on to tell you it had been your idea, and you should have taken her somewhere more classy and \"adult\". Then says your an awful man and thinking of yourself? \n\nYour girlfriend is doing more than just \"following\". She's changing her plans and conveniently altering the truth of who's desire it was to go to the amusement park in the first place. And then she's making a personal attack against you by placing blame and calling you an awful dude....this is toxic. \n\nDon't apologize to her, or for her. She's the one who owes an apology.  Consider very carefully if you want to invest more time into a relationship with someone so weak willed and straight up abusive. Calling you stupid and awful....wow. \n\nIf she's not a fan of childish things, why is she behaving like a child?  This is a whole mess. She needs to sort her shit out and you should not accept this behavior from a nearly 30 year old.", "NTA\n\nYou are so right. If she doesnt appreciate you. Leave her asap. \n\nYou cant save somene who wnats to flock with birds of lower intelligence.", "NTA, but I think you're mistaken in your \"diagnosis.\" The issue isn't herd mentality. She is deeply insecure and feels like she needs approval from her \"friends\" so strongly that she can't mentally function without it.", "NTA - time to walk away before her friends and/or family tell her you\u2019re the next thing that\u2019s silly and immature.", "NTA, and it's not too late to find someone better tbh. She's 27 and still doing this, it won't change", "NTA. But it sounds like she\u2019s not that mature if she\u2019s letting everyone decide what she wants.", "NTA. You should be apologizing for calling her friends names, even though it\u2019s true. You know she is depressed so you coming at her like everyone else does will do nothing but hurt her more. She is getting pulled in all directions because she doesn\u2019t know how to let toxic people go. \n\nHer friends are the assholes though for diminishing the light she has for the small things in life. Them killing her excitement over anything that they find isn\u2019t up to their standards is just pathetic. You should still take her to the amusement park even if she is depressed because she will figure out that her friends were wrong and amusement parks are great.", "NTA. What kind of idiot says it\u2019s childish and bad to go to an amusement park? Hell, my Aunt and Uncle (both in like, their late 40s/early 50s) still go to friggin Disneyland together.", "Half way there. Your timing was crap, though you are probably correct.", "I\u2019m inclined to say a mild ESH.\n\nShe\u2019s a follower, and a particularly insecure, immature type of follower who hasn\u2019t figured out what she likes or wants on her own.  You need to have a good think about whether that\u2019s someone you can be happy with.\n\nMy husband is also a bit of a follower, but the more secure type.  He knows what he likes and isn\u2019t afraid to like unpopular things, but he\u2019s also very laid back and open to experiences, so he\u2019s happy to let others (mostly me) make a lot of the decisions, because he\u2019ll be happy either way.  Amusement park or nice restaurant?  He\u2019ll enjoy either one, so usually I pick.\n\nHaving said that, you were harsh with her.  Someone like that needs you to build her up to have the confidence to like what she likes, not be torn down.  You did pretty much exactly what her \u201cfriends\u201d did, except you attacked her taste in people rather than her taste in activities.", "NTA.  I recently had to tell a relative, \u201cyou aren\u2019t going to shame me out of loving Disney World\u201d.  I love roller coasters and a carousel with a calliope!", "NTA but ask yourself if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone who can't think for herself.

From what food to get, to which clothes to wear, who to date and so on. They even thought they got input on our children's names, their activities and what kind of vehicles we could drive.\n\nOP, if your GF at age 27 still allows others to dictate her every movement, you need to run far and fast.

This is something that is going to take time and effort, but it's what she needs to do to grow into herself as a person. \n\nHer current attitude is a defensive posture taken to avoid doing this because acknowledging the real issue is painful and running away seems easier. The pity of it is that once she does the work she won't get any stress at all from brushing off criticism of her values and likes, as she will be standing on firm ground withing herself.", "NTA\ni love doing new \u201cchildish\u201d things with my bf.

Still love amusement parks.", "Sounds like that should be your approach here long term, but avoid that conversation for now. Short term, you need to make this about her and her happiness and not about you. \n\nWait a bit, until she's settled down, then have a serious chat. Mention she was so excited to go to the amusement park, then backed out when her \"friends\" made fun of her, and that you still want to go to the park if she wants to. Make it clear you want her to be happy on her birthday. You can ALSO go to the fancy restaurant as well afterwards so she doesn't have to lie to her friends about what she did for her birthday, if that helps her. If she doesn't want to leave the house after what's happened, its important you still celebrate her birthday in some way. Get a cake delivered or something, breakfast in bed. You know what she'd like more than reddit.\n\nI would also avoid saying anything like her \"following the herd\" again, because that puts the blame on her instead of the people pushing her around. She's probably hurting and was looking for emotional support, and comments like that make anxieties worse because they feel they can't help it.", "I\u2019m sad for you(TBIs suck!), but also I\u2019m glad you find the joy you can!"]}
