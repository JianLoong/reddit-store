They\u2019re also more expensive than an expensive dinner.

She's 27 and letting her friends kill her joy over a date plan that was her idea.", "Absolutely NTA! It's not childish either, plenty of adults like amusement parks including me.

This is going to be a bigger issue down the road if you don\u2019t discuss it and work on it now. Also, amusement parks are very expensive nowadays.. I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019d end up spending just as much there if not more than at a fancy restaurant (if her friends think lack of money is a motivation), even though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just their way to look down on you since you\u2019re younger than her since she said \u201cchildish things\u201d.", "NTA \u2014 I'm sorry that you find yourself in this situation.

Then says your an awful man and thinking of yourself? \n\nYour girlfriend is doing more than just \"following\". She's changing her plans and conveniently altering the truth of who's desire it was to go to the amusement park in the first place. And then she's making a personal attack against you by placing blame and calling you an awful dude....this is toxic. \n\nDon't apologize to her, or for her. She's the one who owes an apology.  Consider very carefully if you want to invest more time into a relationship with someone so weak willed and straight up abusive. Calling you stupid and awful....wow. \n\nIf she's not a fan of childish things, why is she behaving like a child?  This is a whole mess.

You should be apologizing for calling her friends names, even though it\u2019s true. You know she is depressed so you coming at her like everyone else does will do nothing but hurt her more. She is getting pulled in all directions because she doesn\u2019t know how to let toxic people go. \n\nHer friends are the assholes though for diminishing the light she has for the small things in life. Them killing her excitement over anything that they find isn\u2019t up to their standards is just pathetic. You should still take her to the amusement park even if she is depressed because she will figure out that her friends were wrong and amusement parks are great.", "NTA. What kind of idiot says it\u2019s childish and bad to go to an amusement park? Hell, my Aunt and Uncle (both in like, their late 40s/early 50s) still go to friggin Disneyland together.", "Half way there. Your timing was crap, though you are probably correct.", "I\u2019m inclined to say a mild ESH.\n\nShe\u2019s a follower, and a particularly insecure, immature type of follower who hasn\u2019t figured out what she likes or wants on her own.  You need to have a good think about whether that\u2019s someone you can be happy with.\n\nMy husband is also a bit of a follower, but the more secure type.  He knows what he likes and isn\u2019t afraid to like unpopular things, but he\u2019s also very laid back and open to experiences, so he\u2019s happy to let others (mostly me) make a lot of the decisions, because he\u2019ll be happy either way.  Amusement park or nice restaurant?  He\u2019ll enjoy either one, so usually I pick.\n\nHaving said that, you were harsh with her.  Someone like that needs you to build her up to have the confidence to like what she likes, not be torn down.

This is something that is going to take time and effort, but it's what she needs to do to grow into herself as a person. \n\nHer current attitude is a defensive posture taken to avoid doing this because acknowledging the real issue is painful and running away seems easier.

This is going to continue to annoy you and her family and friends aren\u2019t going anywhere", "TLDR: Girlfriend - An amusement park is a fun date. A very acceptable, normal mature adult activity (As a person eligible to join the AARP, I kind of resent the implication that they aren't.) Try a little bit of everything, not just eating at expensive restaurants. Do things you and your boyfriend have each always wanted to do. Accept that you and your friends and family are not carbon copies of each other. You like things that they don't and vice-versa and that is OKAY and NORMAL. At one point in my life I would have given a LOT to have someone in my life that made sure I got to try the things I hadn't done but wanted to do. \n\nI am sorry this is so long. The topic just really resonates with me. \n\nI am also over 50 years old. No kids. I own ponies. I play video games every day. I love cartoons; I stream SpongeBob SquarePants or Fairly OddParents every night so my brain stops going 90 miles an hour and I can sleep. Okay, also the Great British Bake Off. When I lived close enough to one, I went to Six Flags multiple times every year. I love the Marvel Universe. I am still angry about the state of the DCU.\n\nNow that I have severe social anxiety I can't enjoy some of the 'childish' public activities that I used to really enjoy. Such as State Fairs with rides and crazy food and tons of exhibits. Renaissance fairs. Blockbuster superhero special effects extravaganza movies at the theater opening night. Silly animated movies on a weekend matinee so I can enjoy both the movie and the kids in the audience reacting to it. SciFi-fantasy conventions with Cosplay. Putt-putt, especially after a heavy rain when everyone will play lousy because of all the puddles. I miss these things. And I also miss live theater and concerts and other 'mature' stuff.\n\nMessage to your girlfriend: I know what it is like to grow apart from friends and family who are important to you but lately just leave you feeling down after you see or talk to them. Because your roads are branching away from each other. But you want to keep them in your life so you let go of the things you like about yourself but they don't. And that road goes back to staying one lane when what you really wanted to do is ride the Tail of the Dragon with the top down and the radio blasting.\n\nYou can do all the adulting activities and still have fun doing things others might consider immature. You care about your friends and their opinions but you are different people at the end of it all. You don't like all the same foods, the same drinks and you haven't all had the same experiences. \n\nGo to the amusement park. You'll see (especially at night) other young adult couples with no kids on dates there. You'll share cotton candy. Drive the bumper cars. Kiss each other on the Ferris wheel. Ride the roller coasters. Have fun. \n\nIt won't be the same experience that your friends would have there and that is okay. Your boyfriend is not a... Well, whatever your friends think he is. He doesn't want to take you to the amusement park because he is childish or cheap. He wants to give you something that you have never experienced but have always wanted to try. Anybody can take you to an expensive restaurant. But how boring would expensive restaurants be if you ate out every night? \n\nAfter the amusement park, you can find an 'adult' activity neither of you have done and try it. Live local theater is usually entertaining and pretty cheap. You can adult and be mature without spending a fortune and still have a good time. You and your boyfriend could pick a foreign language to learn.  You can use Duolingo, which is free, and practice on each other. \n\nVery soon- if not now -you will find holiday performances of the Nutcracker ballet almost everywhere. You might enjoy it. I like it. If you like music and can find it, a performance by a full symphony of Handel's Messiah is just... parts of it just give me goosebumps (in a good way). I understand the TransSiberian Orchestra is touring right now. Their holiday music is especially amazing.\n\nGo out to a 'mature event' like those above a handful of times and I bet you that you'll have acquired a whole lot more culture and adulting street cred than these friends and family actually have. You might find something you enjoy enough to repeat and in doing so find a new hobby. Or you might not but you will have had the experience of it. \n\nI have begun to think that successful adulting is mostly just figuring out the things that make you happy and then doing them.", "My gran used to LOVE going on rides with me.  I got dragged around the rides more by her than anyone else.\n\nOP I can tell you with 100% certainty that deep in her heart she still really wants to go.

Promise her that next time you can do something Grown Up for her like go to the ballet.

Bonus points if you go to the ballet too, because it's amazing.", "Went to Europapark together with my bf and another couple and the boys decided they wanted to ride a coaster called Blue Fire.

She can't be just letting people walk all over her while also not even having healthy coping mechanisms when she feels down about herself and her decisions.

We are season pass holders and go all the time. We absolutely love it. (I enjoy it more than my 11 year old) NTA", "NTA. An expensive dinner for every date would be tiresome. An amusement park is something fun and would probably create some great memories.", "There are a number of concerning elements here. The first is that it was her suggestion, and then she got mad at you for \"suggesting an amusement park date\". Only you didn't: she did. From that I get a few things: 1-She deflects blame and responsibility away from herself, and I suspect that it's categorical (as in, she likely does this in a lot of other places too). 2-She derives her sense of self by the opinions of others, and likely only the opinions of others. It consumes her, in the moment, until the emotional toll it takes recedes and she steps through the fog, then feels stupid for having basically just done what everyone else wants, but because of (1), she isn't able to actually take responsibility, so she looks for anything and everything to blame. 3-Her level of emotionality is very high. Quick to anger, quick to cry, but also slow to come down from it. It tells me her emotional maturity level is a bit stunted. 4-This one is a bit more of a guess, but I suspect the age difference is something she is having to defend on the regular, and so something seen as \"childish\" is probably extra-special sauce for her.\n\nAll of these things together usually spell out significant anxiety disorder, and I wouldn't be surprised to find she comes from an extremely toxic, or volatile or overbearing household, where love was never unconditional. My guess is her friends are similar in that regard, perpetuating that way of being \"we will like you as long as you are exactly what we want you to be, or goodbye\".\n\nSo her fear of being alone and removed from these sources of \"worth\" is so extreme that it overrides everything else. If she also has difficulty accepting responsibility for things, it just furthers my assumption of GAD. Now the flipside to that is she clearly feels comfortable with you. She isn't afraid of losing you, so she allows herself to dump on you. So, good in the sense you provide stability and support, REALLY bad in the sense that you are her garbage can for her shitty feelings.\n\nOverall, this isn't a healthy dynamic at all. You are constantly walking on eggshells and probably feel like your opinion is meaningless or worthless. Likely you feel a bit nuts as though you are always at risk of doing something wrong, even if yesterday it was perfectly fine. You need to understand that it isn't you. I mean, sometimes it probably is haha We all do weird stuff. But overall, she seems to have some rather important underlying issues to work through. As it stands, she isn't a healthy partner, and she herself is not happy about where she is I suspect.\n\nWhat you do with that, only you know. I suspect she needs to talk with someone about this, but it can be difficult as it would mean she would have to accept that there is something to work on, violating (1) yet again. That can be the hardest hurdle to jump. Accepting responsibility makes everything else easier. But just as important is you NOT accepting responsibility for things you didn't do. You CANNOT allow yourself to assume blame all the time. It's an incredibly poor dynamic and can erode your sense of self and reality if it goes on too long. She won't be doing it on purpose, but that doesn't really matter as the result is the same.\n\nSo from my perspective, it highlights some rather important things to work through. Not in any way dealbreakers necessarily, but probably unavoidable at some point. I hope this helps you! It was really long!
