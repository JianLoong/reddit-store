Thats a lot of money for someone in their 20s (I dont know OPs actual age, but considering the Swiftie since age 11 its probably something like that). Choosing to gift that ticket to your Sister instead is a really nice thing to do especially since she also gets to take her best friend and she really needs a reality-check for not seeing that at all but instead being mad at OP. \nI agree though that the parents are anabeling that behauviour", "At this point I think this has to be guerrilla marketing", "Two step verification if possible", "I wish I could draw more attention to this comment", "So glad to hear hope that you and your mate have a fabulous time!\u2764\ufe0f", "I second that. Maybe thats enough Internet for today because I immediatly knew which post you were talking about", "NTA - would she ever do something like that for you?\n\nShe and her mother are acting very entitled and your father is just sitting on the fence.\n\nEnjoy your front row seats with your friend.", "Man I remember being 17, dreaming about seeing my favourite bands and specifically thinking about how little I'd care about being at the very back, just being in the same room and hearing my idols performing my favourite songs would have meant the whole world to me. I used to watch terrible quality youtube videos of gigs filmed from the back row and get so jealous of the person who got to just be there in the room... If someone close to me had offered me tickets to my favourite band at the time, I would NOT have been picky about where I'd be sitting, especially if I'd only gotten into them through that person...", "How can they be in your safe? All of the tickets were digital only.", "Yes, sorry, it's a joke with my friend, it means I compulsively check I have them like 3 times a day"]}
