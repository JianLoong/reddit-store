You\u2019re actually being pretty freaking unbelievably nice. \n\nI hope y\u2019all have a great time! If your sister is still hung up on front row then she doesn\u2019t have to go at all!

Haha", "NTA and watch those tickets  VERY carefully", "NTA. just tell her if she is so upset about going to the concert you can just sell the ticket to someone else who will be more grateful for it and have some extra spending money for the concert.", "NTA.  You won the special tickets, you are free to take whoever you want with you.  You are not obligated to choose any particular person as your companion for the front row.", "NTA. Before you won extra tickets she wasn't going *at all*, but now she's entitled to a front row seat? And this was all it took for her to throw a little fit about it? I know from experience that these are red flags that you are about to attend a concert with someone who will *ruin the entire experience for everyone within earshot* \n\nThis means she will most likely act like a spoiled brat no matter where she sits, and will probably complain through the entire show.\n\nEnjoy the show with your friend, it sounds like you've earned it", "NTA.\nSpoiled sister.", "Easily NTA. You\u2019re going with your best friend, she is going with hers. She isn\u2019t entitled to the front row ticket, it\u2019s yours to choose whomever you want to go with.", "NTA.

Your sister is definitely old enough to understand that and not be so ungrateful.", "NTA\nYour sister should just say thank you and shut up.

Time to put hers on stubhub for being such a brat", "NTA", "Your sister and your parents are the Reddit level AHs here. You won the tickets. You want to take your long time Swifty loving friend.

Entitlement. She needs to be happy with taking the original seats or not go at all. Your family shouldn't be taking her side on this.\n\n(As a side note: Does sister realize that buying those tickets on resell are easily $500+...?

Sister really doesn\u2019t appreciate how lucky she is to even be going.

It was awesome both times even though one of the nights was Nashville night 3 with delays and rain.", "NTA you're giving her an extremely hard to get and expensive gift", "Right? Like, those tickets are expensive and  hard to come by, so getting any ticket, for free no less, is basically winning the lottery. \n\nAnd maybe I've spent too  much time on AITA, but OP might I suggest you keep an eye on the tickets so they don't mysteriously go missing so your halfsister can go, but you can't, like that one post from earlier where the OP's 30-something step-children hid his daughter's passports to stay home and babysit their kids while the rest went on a \"family\" vacation.", "Yeah, I feel like there are situations where a teenager needs their parents to stop them from ruining something and this was one of them.", "As a Taylor Swift fan and someone deep into the fandom, I have not heard any of this. I went to two concerts and everyone around us were amazing and just incredibly happy to be there. Truly a great crowd."]}
