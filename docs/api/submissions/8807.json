Oh no, the HORROR.\n\nYour colleague is way out of line commenting on your body. This is so incredibly creepy, particularly because she had to have been looking for your videos!

Your dance videos do not contain any sexually suggestive content or offensive language, and your abs being momentarily exposed while breakdancing is not a cause for concern. The teacher's request to take down the videos and her warning to report you are unwarranted and intrusive.

She is sexualizing your body and your hobby. \n\nAs a woman who did a lot of dance (ballet, modern, and middle eastern) as a teen, some people would just get really gross about the fact that I was a \"dancer\" and let their imagination run wild.
