Next time, I\u2019d just say: \u201cwe are planning a romantic evening so let\u2019s set something up another time\u201d.\n\nNash absolutely should not have invited herself, or expected you to pay. Your girlfriend should be blaming her friend for being rude and making a scene, not you. \n\nYour girlfriend also should have shut down the idea of her joining you, rather than asking if you were okay with it. Nash is her friend, she is responsible for setting boundaries with her.\n\nNTA", " Nash invited herself along to go and your girlfriend told herbit was okay  \nYou are under zero obligation to pay for her.\nIf your girlfriend didn't want a scene she should have paid for her friend then.", "Question for the women: Do all y\u2019all expect ur bf or person that\u2019s taking u on a date to pay for ur friends if they come or is just a couple who think this way", "Not at all. In fact I wouldn't let my friend come on a date with us in the first place.", "Nope. Either the inviting person pays, or everyone pays for themselves.", "If I met a bf/gf on their way to a date I wouldn't think of joining them and being a third wheel, unless they *both* insisted they were happy with it. Sitting alone at a table with a boyfriend and girlfriend on a date would just be awkward.", "Ok just checking cuz this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve seen something like this on the internet.have u seen the video where the girl expected her bf to pay for like 10 of her friends plus her when the bf took the gf out for a birthday dinner", "No, but I hate girls like this, they're so selfish and entitled. If I was the guy, I'd dump her ass so fast her head would spin.", "NTA.  You allowed her to join you. Not to take her out to eat. GF should have taken offense along with you. Nash was the one who needed to be told to just pay so it prevents a scene. A big no next time Nash asks and yeah I would be telling that story about Nash to anybody who knows her and is interested. To warn them.", "NTA. Nash invited herself. It's not your job to keep a grown up from throwing a fit at a restaurant. That's like buying a child a toy at the store because they threw a tantrum in the aisle.", "NTA. She invited herself then expected you to pay. Your gf is an AH for telling you you should have paid.", "NTA. As to answer your last question: If you (and both ladies) wanted a threesome.\n\nStill old-dated and mysogenistic, but yeah, in that case, I can see you're expected to pay.", "NTA IF your gf felt that way why didn\u2019t she pay for her friend", "NTA. Nash invited herself along on your date\u2026 I personally wouldn\u2019t of even let her come. I would\u2019ve said well look I was just planning on this being a date night for us.

Actual question, not comment.", "NTA.  Nash sounds very entitled.  She invited herself to your lunch date and then expected someone else to pay?", "NTA Had you bumped into Nash on the way and invited her; I could see maybe paying. But since she invited herself, what appeared to be a date, she can pay for herself.", "Well let\u2019s not be ridiculous haha what is this, a logical world ? \n\nOP is literally the least responsible for paying. The friend should pay for herself, or OPs girlfriend who invited her should pay. Can\u2019t think of any reason OP should pay other than he had a penis\u2026.", "The bad part is that his girlfriend didn't invite her. The friend invited herself!", "IMO it doesn't matter either way. I'm guessing that OP did not invite Nash, perhaps GF did. But then that would make the cost of Nash's meal GFs problem, not OP", "Nope. My husband never did when we were dating and my friends never expected him to.", "Who\u2019s downvoting me", "If the OP invited, then maybe, but he's almost certainly NTA here.", "The ones who expect you to be the walking cash machine....", "It's probably because you said females. Makes you sound more like an incel than you might have intended. It might be better to just say women instead next time.", "I mean, even if he invited her to join them he\u2019s not obligated to pay for her. My friends and I ask each other to go out all the time to have dinner but there\u2019s never an expectation that the person asking should have to pay the whole bill.", "Like all I did was ask a question \ud83d\ude02", "Definitely wasn\u2019t tryna to sound like an incel.fixed jt", "Oh yes, I get you.  Even if he invited her, there's only a slim chance that something happened to make her think she's getting a free meal.", "I get that. I also just think it\u2019s really wild though that some people automatically assume that if someone ask them to dinner that they\u2019re being treated to said dinner.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't invite her, she invited herself. Therefore you don't pay for her, she pays for herself. She seems to be under the narcissistic impression that crashing her friend's date gets rewarded with a free meal. Unfortunately for her, no amount of ego changes the fact that the world actually revolves around the sun!", "NTA. Her friend invited herself. And puts you in an awkward position. The girlfriend says you should have paid to not cause a scene. Sounds like a polite mugging or something.", "NTA.  I can't believe how generous people can be with other people's money.  She invites her friend and then expects you to pay for friend?  Sorry, doesn't work that way.  You were under no obligation to pay for Nash.", "NTA and I think it\u2019s weird for your GF to invite Nash if y\u2019all are out in a date", "NTA, when I invite myself , I always pay. Wait! I never invite myself.", "NTA. Your gf could've also paid for her friend if she didn't want a scene.", "OP=NTA\n\ngirlfriend invited HER friend to your lunch.\n\nThis means either girlfriend or friend pays for her lunch.", "NTA. Nash and your GF were presumptuous. I guess some people would have paid for Nash but you weren\u2019t obligated to.", ">On our way home my GF told I should've just paid so there wouldn't be a scene but I didn't respond.\n\nMore like, she shouldn't had unrealistic expectations and made a scene.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. but you don\u00b4t \"bumped\" her by chance.  your girlfriend probably informen her friend your plans and coordinated with her to appear there in order to force you to pay for both of them", "NTA \n\nI hope that teaches her not to invite herself on other people\u2019s dates in the future.  Sheesh.", "NTA- she wanted to go, she should pay.", "NTA , this girl is not a friend, she is a leech", "NTA why would she ever think she wouldn't be paying lol", "NTA, she invited herself.", "NTA. Tell your GF to pay for the person she invited.", "NTA", "Nta, your gf would be only other person that could pay.", "NTA. I'd never expect people to pay for me if I tag along for dinner. Or even if I'm invited.\n\nAlso...if it was such a big deal why didn't your girlfriend pay for his dinner? Wtf", "NTA. You didn\u2019t invite her and she\u2019s not even your friend. Why would it be your responsibility to pay for her?", "NTA. Don\u2019t invite yourself and be mad you had to pay. She literally infringed on YOUR date.", "NTA..She invited herself.", "NTA \n\nI would have specified two checks at the beginning but you\u2019re definitely NTA for paying for you and your girlfriend.", "And who thinks avoiding a scene by indulging the person throwing the tantrum is a good idea?  Sorry, but don't we learn that giving into toddlers just makes the tantrums worse?  How would that change with an adult willing to try to con others into paying their way by causing scenes?", "This. And Op should seriously reconsider his relationship with his girlfriend if she thinks he\u2019s in the wrong here", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for some random person.", "NTA. Nash invited herself. It's not your job to keep a grown up from throwing a fit at a restaurant.", "Doesn't even sound like the gf invited her. She invited herself. Clown behavior.", "And \"rewarding\" an adult temper tantrum by anyone is a great idea!  Won't lead to future drama and scenes ever. /s", "The girlfriend should have said.  *I'd love to have lunch with you another day, but OP is treating me to a lunch DATE right now.  But it's great seeing you again, text me and we'll arrange a time.*", "Yeah I wouldn't assume it unless they said it was their treat or something", "Exactly but there are a lot of people that say hey are you interested in going to dinner on Friday and then the person that they ask assumes that the dinner is being paid for by the person that asked. And I just don\u2019t get this mentality at all."]}
