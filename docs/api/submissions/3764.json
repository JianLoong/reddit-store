I was always down a few hundred dollars. After 3-4 outings I just stopped offering, and they stopped inviting me. \n\nThese people treated me like poop outside of restaurants. Spiking the punch at house parties, having everyone bring a dish made of pig at potlucks (the hostess would assign people what to bring and it would always have ham, pork, sausage, bacon, etc in it).
