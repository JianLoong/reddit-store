She also paid for most meals as her treat. \n\nWe have another Aunt who I am NC and my sister was LC. We discussed letting her know. I was adamant if she was invited I would not go on the trip. My sister felt the same way. Therefore she was not invited. Unbeknownst to me and my sister our Facebook profiles were public and she say a comment about the trip. Well all hell broke loose.

Would not listen that we were paying for it ourselves. \n\nLong story short they could have not wanted to hurt your feelings and felt mentioning it would have made you upset.

It\u2019s always such a sweet gesture when a friend or family member is going on a trip and asks if I can come. I usually can\u2019t. But just being *invited* makes a huge difference to me. It makes me feel included and wanted. \n\nHowever - it must be said that this was a conversation I had with the important people in my life. I told them about how important it is to me to be included, and how I\u2019d like to be able to make the decision about whether or not I can go with them without impeding their trip and their goals for the trip. Can I go to a local bookstore while they\u2019re out hiking? Can I sit in a park and admire the wildlife while they\u2019re spelunking in a cave? Can I go see a show while they\u2019re body surfing? \n\nMost of the time I can\u2019t go.

If you haven\u2019t had a direct, adult conversation with them about it, they may just be doing what they think is the best and *least* hurtful thing. They may simply not realize it hurts more to be excluded than to make your own decision about your restrictions, both based on your disability and your finances. \n\nUnless there are other family dynamics we don\u2019t know about here, take the opportunity to explain to your family how you want to be excited for them, to travel vicariously with them through photos and preparation for their trips.

It is for people that do not have assets and have not worked long enough under the social security system to qualify for retirement income.\n\nSSI is less than $1,000 a month. If you have additional income during that month you can lose part of your SSI benefits. If you have assets over a certain amount, you cannot qualify for SSI.\n\nFor SSDI disability retirement you can have as much assets as you can.  It's based on your work history.\n\nFor the OP, have you checked to see if you qualify for SSDI based on your ex-husband's record?", "I receive SSDI and I was able to get married just fine.  No loss of benefits.", "Where are you people getting all these rules from?  That is not true!  \nI'm on SSDI so I know what I'm talking about.  \nNo one checks my finances but they do ask for current medical information from time to time.", "Amazing that anyone would think a single mom raising 5 kids in these conditions is a whiner. I don\u2019t know you or whether you\u2019re a good person or any of that, but I know they wouldn\u2019t last a day in your shoes OP.", "Can you get SSDI based on your ex husband's record?", "Ahh OK. \n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s getting worse here. \n\nI can claim PIP (yay!) - I\u2019d rather have working legs tbh. \n\nBut they\u2019re moving everyone that was historically on ESA to UC and \u201cnot fit for work\u201d so about \u00a3360 per month. Also reducing SDP as unless on ESA can\u2019t claim it. \n\nFeels like we\u2019re back in the 50s and we are supposed to be locked up in a hospital tbh.", "What if she had said yes though? And then ruined their trip? We are only getting one side of the story here.", "She has no option coz she can't afford it. It's like asking a broke friend if he wants to have dinner at a fancy restaurant. Either you're paying or he's not going.", "Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nETA: monthly payment for people who can't work due to a disability (for those who qualify).", "Maximum SSI for an individual would be $914 a month or about 856 euro. From what I remember of my summer job at the agency who administers the program,  SSI is for disabled people without enough work experience to claim regular social security disability.  Sadly, for most people in this economic climate,  a European vacation would be beyond them.", "SSDI = Social Security Disability Insurance. It's a US program to pay a basic cost of living income to people who have been certified by a physician as unable to work due to a medical condition. The payments are not generous, put it that way.", ">My ex was very abusive and they had wanted me to leave him years earlier and even at that time offered to pay for me to live near them for a year while I got back on my feet. I wasn't ready at that point though and declined their offer.\n\n>going no contact with my mom for 18 months\n\n>I contacted them about my daughter's suicide attempt last year and asked them not to tell her\n\n>I said I couldn't mentally deal with taking care of my daughter and manage to take her judgment too\n\nThis sounds like a lot of drama. It also sounds like they try to help you and your family, but you refuse their help, making the conversations unproductive and just adding stress to them. The distance may be because they don\u2019t want to have to deal with it if these are the conversation topics they have with you. It\u2019s tough to be in a position where someone you care about is struggling, tells you all their struggles, but demands no input or assistance. The response from your stepfather gives the impression that at least some of your family just sees it as whining, which it could be from their perspective.", "Disabled here who didn't marry for some time for that reason. You have to be careful, because you can still lose if they think a partner is supporting you. Eventually my husband and I needed to marry. It's basically $1,500+ a month difference. My payment was reduced (-400), and now he has to pay for my primary insurance coverage (+900) and my prescriptions cost more (+200-300).", "Thanks for the correction!", "That's because you get SSDI which is based on your work history. \n\nSSI is a welfare program. And I don't mean that in a bad way saying it's a welfare program. It just is", "I'm on SSDI as well, but I've also been on SSDI *plus* SSI. I tried to explain the difference, because it's a big one, but I guess I fell short, sorry. SSDI alone doesn't care about how much you have, as you know. However, SSDI *alone* means you're receiving too much to qualify for SSI. \n\nOP said she's disabled, but she specified SSI. If she qualifies for SSI, it means her SSDI payment is low enough that she automatically gets it. SSI is a completely different set of rules. Since SSI *is* dependent on your finances, that's when they keep track of it. \n\nI had to account for *everything* when they would check to continue assistance. They found I was listed as a beneficiary on one of my parents savings accounts *when they died* and SSI still insisted it counted as a current asset, making me exceed the $2,000 allowable limit.\n\nI genuinely hope this helps any confusion, but if I missed something, let me know and I'll try to fill in any gaps :)", "All OP said was she wanted to be asked, that's it. She already knew she wouldn't be able to go.", "OP already said she couldn't afford it, all she wanted was to be asked. That's it.", "Thank you! That explains it. So basically peanuts that people are supposed to be able to live on.", "SSDI is for people who have 7 years work experience in the last 7 years before they filed. So someone could have worked 30 years but then at 37 years apply and not be accepted", "Thank you. That explains a lot. \n\nEvery time I read stuff like this it makes me glad I can still work. Legs might not, but brain does. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how people are supposed to make ends meet and survive, much less aggies the odd treat. \n\nIn the UK, people are being forced to move to UC and are lucky to get the equivalent of approx \u20ac400 a month.", "Thank you! That explains it. So basically peanuts that people are supposed to be able to live on.", "THEY might not have known that she wouldn\u2019t be able to go though.", "And what would happen if she said yes? Siblings don't know how she's gonna respond. And them asking her to come (knowing she can't afford it) kinda implies that they're willing to pay for her.\nIf you're going to invite a known broke person to anything, you better be prepared to put out some cash.", "Does the family know? \n\nBecause IT IS rude to invite someone to an event you know they can't join.", "There\u2019s definitely exceptions to this though. I know people on disability and get $1200+ a month that never worked. Social security benefits confuse the hell out of me though. There\u2019s all different ones that can get added together in your income", "You are very welcome. I got sick when I was going for my master's degree. Luckily, on my first job I signed up for private insurance, a perk the union promoted. When I got too sick to work, the private insurance paid significantly more than government benefits. The insurance company gambled that a person my age wouldn't be applying for disability.", "Exactly. And, depending on where you live in the country, you might be able to squeak by on it, assuming nothing goes wrong (and how often does that happen?) But if you live in a high cost of living city... not even a chance.", "Probably DAC, which you have to be disabled before 22 for.", "I can imagine they did. I became disabled at 34. No one expected it."]}
