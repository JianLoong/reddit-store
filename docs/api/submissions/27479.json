I had recently talked to my oldest sister who had mentioned a special trip with her daughter to Paris, I was really excited for her. She failed to mention that it was with my 2 brothers, their families and our other sister. I still would have been excited for her. When my dad finally responded to my text asking if my siblings were all on a trip together I was told I was being dramatic and needed to get over it because I wouldn't have been able to afford it so they didn't invite me. My siblings are all well off and I am disabled and barely making ends meet on SSI. I told my dad it wasn't about me not going, it was about not even being invited or told.  He said he wasn't invited either and I didn't see him whining.\n\nI don't think it's the same at all. I just wish they would have asked me and let me decide for myself if I could go or not. It just sucks so badly, I feel like they are ashamed of me. I already feel less than by society as a whole and now my family. It's made me incredibly depressed like why am I even here, the people that are supposed to love me would rather believe I don't exist. I ended the night crying and blocked everyone on everything.\n\nEdit to add: the blocking wasn't just because of this. This is just the final straw on the camels back.\n\nEdit 2: I never expect them to pay for me and especially for an expensive trip like this. My brothers take international trips frequently and I see those pictures online and think that's awesome. I was sad because this was everyone minus me.

I wouldn\u2019t have blocked them, but there would\u2019ve been greater distance between us because I could never forgive them.", "INFO: Are you disabled in a way that makes it difficult to get around? Paris is old and not very accessible (which isn\u2019t fair, I know). People tend to wander on foot over bumpy, old cobblestone streets for miles. They may have not included you for fear of you falling or slowing the group down (again not fair).", "This is difficult. NAH.\n\nLook, its hard when you know that someone flat out can't afford to do something. I bet they wanted to include you but knowing you wouldn't be able to afford to go and that you'd turn it down - that is hurtful. But, I also see the perspective of \"well, they can't afford it so why rub salt in the wound.\"", "NTA\n\nYou found out about this trip in a very cruel way.  They should have invited you and let you figure out if you could afford it and if your disability would have hindered your participation.  They sound ableist to me - could that be at the root of it?  You would have crimped their style?  They may actually be ashamed of you as you propose.  Your dad is an AH for defending them.\n\nBeing angry is completely justifiable as is blocking them for the moment.  You are owed an apology.  I hope you have someone who you can talk these feelings through with.", "Wouldn't inviting you to go be an insult? Or do you expect them to pay for you?", "I'm sorry, this would really hurt my feelings, too.", "ESH. They were protecting your feelings. If they had invited you on an expensive but great trip that they knew you couldn't afford, then you'd have been really sad about not being able to go.\n\nYou'd have gone on with your life in blissful ignorance if this had happened years ago. Today, people's lives are routinely revealed on social media. Somebody felt the need to blab on FB, and you found out.\n\nGiven the high odds of this happening, they should have gently let you know about the trip in advance and at least offered you the chance to decline. However, blocking them over this, even as the final straw, seems excessive.", "Yta.  My hubs sibs go on trips where everyone goes but we are not included.  It seems weird to me because my family is closer than that, but really it is not something to get all upset about. We are still cordial with them, would we like to be invited?  Yeah. But really, just move on from it.  \n\nIf you were invited and scraped up the money for the flight, they would feel obliged to try to save money for that whole time.  Oh, cannot go to this museum because the tickets are $30.  Oh not this nice restaurant because OP and her family would not be able to afford it.  They probably didn\u2019t tell you because they knew you would be hurt and make a big deal out of it.   It would be rubbing your nose in their much better financial circumstances.   Quit throwing a tantrum.   You describe that you barely scrape by,  so you could not have gone.", "Yta.  I have a feeling you would not have reacted any better if they had invited you or told you about it.  You can\u2019t afford a trip to Paris.   You admit that.   Seems they were trying to be respectful of your feelings by not inviting you on a trip you cannot afford.", "YTA-They don\u2019t need to ask or run things through you.  They probably have their own reasons.  I don\u2019t have a great relationship with my sister and she is similar to you.  I traveled to Europe and Asia for work a lot and all I would here when I went to visit my parents from my sister is \u201cIt must be nice\u201d. I had enough and said we both grew up in the same house but made different choices with our careers.  Our parents didn\u2019t pay for college and we chose separate lives.  I told her some honest opinions and she told me hers.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what your relationship is with your siblings but just like my sister and I have chosen different paths.  Intentionally or not they are individual family units and don\u2019t need to ask you to do anything with them just because their siblings.  Get over it.  You just sound like your pouting.  I bet when you say them like my sister your first comment will be \u201cmust be nice\u201d.", "If anyone asked my grandma should would have said the same things you posted, she would have been so hurt she wasn't asked even though she knows she couldn't have afforded it on her fixed income. She would have been happy to see the rest of the family having fun. The reality though would have been very different - she would have whined to anyone in earshot about her being left out. She would have cried that no one loved her and generally been a pain in the ass to be around. I honestly hated spending time with her because of how she acted. I'd suggest looking inward for more clues on why they didn't invite you. There may be more tha. The money aspect.", "NTA\n\nThey knew they were doing something wrong, which is why they didn't tell you. Not even mentioning it is pretty mean. Even the one person who did mention it misrepresented what the trip was to you. It also kinda feels like they deliberately excluded your kids, too, when all their kids were there. That can't feel good to them either.\n\nMaybe there was a valid reason they didn't, but they tried to be shady about it. Focus on your family and your kids, keep contact low because you're just gonna get a million excuses why they didn't invite you while ignoring the larger issue of them trying to hide it from you in the first place was hurtful\n\nAlso, I'd just not talk to your dad about anything super serious anymore. Doesn't seem like he's someone that's ever gonna be super empathetic", "NTA, the least they could have done was invite you!", "YTA\npeople do stuff together without you, that's normal and expected.

My sister, myself and one of my aunts went to Paris. It was dream for all of us to travel there. My mom passed away a few years before so this was a special trip. We all paid our own way. The only thing my Aunt gave us was accommodation as we stayed at her friends apartment because they were not there. She also paid for most meals as her treat. \n\nWe have another Aunt who I am NC and my sister was LC. We discussed letting her know. I was adamant if she was invited I would not go on the trip. My sister felt the same way. Therefore she was not invited. Unbeknownst to me and my sister our Facebook profiles were public and she say a comment about the trip. Well all hell broke loose. She started screaming at all of us. Thinking her sister was paying for the trip and she should have been invited. She would have never been able to afford the trip as she hasn\u2019t worked in years. Would not listen that we were paying for it ourselves. \n\nLong story short they could have not wanted to hurt your feelings and felt mentioning it would have made you upset. Or they just didn\u2019t want you to attend depending on the relationship and felt not saying something was better than risking having you attend. \n\nI don\u2019t think either option is good and they made the best decision they felt was right at the time.", "Yeah I understand blocking is a big move. And I did edit to add the blocking wasn't just for this either. I wasn't invited to my oldest nephew's wedding years ago either but that was understandable because that sister and I have never ever gotten along, but I do love my nephew. My brother recently came to town with his daughters and never told me so my kids could see their cousins. My dad will drive 7 hours to see my brother 20 minutes away but not see me or my kids. It's like they are ashamed of me since my divorce because I am now poor.", "Yeah I wouldn't have been able to go without a mobility device. I'm actually glad I didn't thinking about how hard it would have been. It is more about the BIG adventure they are taking and I found out on social media instead of them even though I talked to my oldest sister just a little bit ago.\n\nWhen my nephew got married I found out after the fact too.\n\nAt least my other nephew who is getting married invited me and said, \"hey we understand you may not be able to travel to make it so we were asking early to get a head count if you think you might be able to come.\"\n\nIt's just a small consideration that meant the world to me.", "Yeah, I can see that. It hurts more because they didn't tell me and I found out on social media. Like dude why not tell me so I wasn't blindsided.", "Yes I am going to find a therapist. I am struggling with my own feelings of self worth and this absolutely made me think...see I was right.", "I would rather know they are all going somewhere together and be excited for them than find out on social media.  No I would never ask them or expect them to pay for me.", "How would it be an insult to invite OP? Better to be invited and decline than to not even be told about it.", "That seems fair. I can totally see your point about the blocking maybe it was a rash decision made in an emotional moment.", "I think I decided we are all aholes. Them for not telling me about a big family trip and me for blocking them.", "It's hurtful because we used to be very close. My oldest sister and I talked every day for a long time. My divorce and then my disability have put me on the outside looking in and the more they do things like this the more I see that.", "I reacted totally fine when my sister told me about a trip to Paris with her daughter. My brother's take international trips all the time. I have never been sad or reacted badly at all. This was the 1 time because it was a sibling trip. I know I can't afford it, I could have been invited though. I would have said that's awesome take and send me lots of pictures because I can't afford to go.", "I love looking at their pictures and I'm happy to see their adventures. It's great they have the money to do things. If it had just been the 2 brothers no issue they do that all the time.  If it had just been the 2 sisters cool no need to tell me. And I wouldn't have even gone, the point is that I wasn't given a heads up and found out because of social media.", "It's like you know my family lol", "Someone responded with a great convo to have with them. Just saying hey I know you know I can't really afford things like this anymore not to mention my disability would have made it hard to get around and I'm really happy you all finally got to go back to Europe (I was born there) I just would have appreciated a heads up so I didn't have to find out on social media.", "Imagine everyone in your graduating class getting an invitation to the class reunion and you didn't because they didn't like how you dressed.", "Yeah, that better explains the blocking. Just focus on you and your kids. I think there's a larger issue going on here. I don't know if you share blame in this or not, but you're being cut out and continuing to think about that is just going to hurt you. Don't waste effort on those who won't do the same for you, end of the day", "Completely understood. There\u2019s a point where enough is enough and you have to protect yourself", "You\u2019re NTA for being upset, and I don\u2019t know the story with your nephew. Life stinks sometimes, they should have just told you, seeing everyone having fun without you probably hurt.", "And that is the honest conversation to have with them when they get back.

While I'd have loved to have gone, let's be real - I'm not in a place to have afforded it. But, next time can you all just give me a heads up that you are going so I'm not finding out on social media? Its just really weird finding out all my siblings have gone somewhere and I find out on social media.\"", "Ok. I guess it wouldn't matter to me. As you said, there is more to the story. Do you think that is why they didn't totally fill you in? Also, you are still a person. Don't let their behavior make you feel less. Yes, family is supposed to be a support, but unfortunately, some people missed that memo.", "You said the trip was originally a mother-daughter trip, sounds like everyone else in the family kinda invited themselves\u2014like what you tried to do AFTER finding out about it. YTA, you aren\u2019t owed an invite, explanation or even a heads up cause it\u2019s NOT you\u2019re business.", "OP says she is on SSI. Highly unlikely she could afford it. Idk, I think it would be rude.", "It wouldn\u2019t have been easier to hear your siblings are all going on a trip without you.  I get being sad about that but your reaction to block everyone and assume this was malicious is what makes you the asshole.  I have 2 siblings. We take vacations with our father since my mom passed away 10 years ago so our dad has someone to travel with.  We have only been able to all go twice in 10 years.  We have jobs and families.  Those who go try to be sensitive to whoever isn\u2019t going.   It\u2019s always sad for whoever isn\u2019t going.  But whoever isn\u2019t going doesn\u2019t get pissy and those going don\u2019t talk and plan in front of the one not going.", "They're adults with their own lives. You're not entitled to a heads up", "That sounded very mature. Even if you were to go, it wouldn\u2019t their responsibility to pay for you. And you even stated that you wouldn\u2019t ask them to do that. If they invited you and you said yes, it would be your responsibility to pay for it. They are the assholes for not even inviting you. It\u2019s just common courtesy", "Yeah that's a great way to put it. That's exactly how I feel. Thank you.", "Actually what I found it was that it was just supposed to be the 2 brothers going then my sisters asked if it could be a sibling trip and planned it that way. Maybe not an invite but at least a hey you're going to see pictures of us all in Paris on a sibling trip, we know you can't afford it so we didn't invite you but didn't want you to be surprised when you saw the post.", "This whole comment was rude, not only did u assume everyone invited themselves, you blamed op for feeling excluded. Like please just don\u2019t be a jerk, and clearly common decency isn\u2019t comment because a courtesy invite would of been decent.", "Yea, it is unlikely but it's not exactly rude to ask. Even if OP declined, it's better that she declined rather than having that decision made for her.", "Well obviously not entitled to be included in anything for family either. Just because she\u2019s disabled doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t have feelings. It sounds like they just don\u2019t want anything to do with her.\n\nI guess she\u2019ll just have to block them all and not have anything to do with them that\u2019s what they want. Maybe find a support group that she can move forward with who needs people like this.", "Yeah, after reading how they've treated her and her kids since the divorce and disability, I'm pretty down with Reddit Solution #3-NC with a side of RS#2-Therapy."]}
