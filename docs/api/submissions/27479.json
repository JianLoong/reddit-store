She also paid for most meals as her treat. \n\nWe have another Aunt who I am NC and my sister was LC. We discussed letting her know. I was adamant if she was invited I would not go on the trip. My sister felt the same way. Therefore she was not invited. Unbeknownst to me and my sister our Facebook profiles were public and she say a comment about the trip. Well all hell broke loose.

Would not listen that we were paying for it ourselves. \n\nLong story short they could have not wanted to hurt your feelings and felt mentioning it would have made you upset.

It\u2019s always such a sweet gesture when a friend or family member is going on a trip and asks if I can come. I usually can\u2019t. But just being *invited* makes a huge difference to me. It makes me feel included and wanted. \n\nHowever - it must be said that this was a conversation I had with the important people in my life. I told them about how important it is to me to be included, and how I\u2019d like to be able to make the decision about whether or not I can go with them without impeding their trip and their goals for the trip. Can I go to a local bookstore while they\u2019re out hiking? Can I sit in a park and admire the wildlife while they\u2019re spelunking in a cave? Can I go see a show while they\u2019re body surfing? \n\nMost of the time I can\u2019t go.

If you haven\u2019t had a direct, adult conversation with them about it, they may just be doing what they think is the best and *least* hurtful thing. They may simply not realize it hurts more to be excluded than to make your own decision about your restrictions, both based on your disability and your finances. \n\nUnless there are other family dynamics we don\u2019t know about here, take the opportunity to explain to your family how you want to be excited for them, to travel vicariously with them through photos and preparation for their trips.

I told them it hurt me to be excluded and that I could've decided for myself if I could afford to go or decline, but they did it again.

Mom and sister simply didn't want me there, even though I thought we all got along.\n\n20 years later, my sister died suddenly while I was battling Stage 3 cancer, and my dad then killed himself in his grief.

They knew you couldn't afford it, didn't want to make you feel less than for not being able to afford it, and knew you were sensitive so didn't bring it up. I disagree with how they handled it, but I don't think that makes them assholes.", "But \u201cnot rubbing salt in the wound\u201d wasn\u2019t an option.

Even when my oldest sisters house was destroyed in a tornado he didn't help. I did help my siblings, giving the younger brothers a place to live at points. The oldest sister money or filled gas when they needed but that's been awhile ago when they weren't as well off. We grew up being taught that you take care of family no matter what. I wouldn't dare ask for any money from my siblings now unless one of my kids was literally dying.\n\n2. When the divorce was actually happening I'm sure I did. I don't even remember the last time I talked to them about my ex at all. My ex and I are coparenting just fine. I don't know that they have even asked me about how much I get from the government or in child support. They know I live in section 8 housing, and that I get food stamps.\n\n3. Ha no. I was the middle child.  We were Mormon and they had a very strong mindset of boys are the important ones because they pass along the family name.  Even when my grandpa passed my 2 brothers got inheritance but the 3 girls didn't. I don't expect a dime, and I don't even care. I'd rather not fight about anything with my siblings if they want it all that's fine by me, or better still I hope my parents live a joyfully life and spend every dime they deserve it they worked for it.\n\n4. We were Mormon and girls at that time were supposed to get married at 18 or go on a mission at 21. BUT I actually did have a job in high school, moved out at 18...and got married at 21.

I asked my SO why they'd accept when I haven't been invited. We've been together close to 15 years now. This happened this year, not too long ago.

It would've hurt to be excluded to the trip, not even invited, but at least you wouldn't have found out through your daughter. But... also, I think you overreacted with your step dad. Not even about blocking them because they are abroad, probably didn't even found out you block them, so... but it's probably not your parents fault so why whining to them? \nI think feeling rejected is valid, feeling offended it is too. They hurt your feelings and by proximity also your kids and holding a grudge for this is valid... but, like I said, your first reaction to this was very childish. If you still want them in your life you should've waited until they're back and tell them how you felt. Did you text any of your siblings when you saw the pictures? Because if you didn't then you are the only one having a hard time here, they are having fun, never realized you blocked them, you are suffering alone. \nObviously, you are not the AH for having feelings and a broken heart. I totally understand. My family is dismissive as well and also have reduced mobility. I never thought their exclusions towards me could be ableism until I read your post. I understand how it hurts and I'm so Sorry for that. Your feelings are valid... so, if you still want them in your life, even if it's just in the distance, tell them how you felt but this time try not not act like a teenager because poverty, divorce and disability doesn't make you immature or salty, that's your personality.

It seems a bit odd that she didn't mention her other siblings/families would be on the same trip.  If she is close enough with her sibling to talk about future vacation plans its odd not to mention the other people who would also be going on the trip. NAH though because maybe your relationship has changed with your siblings and you haven't noticed the signs.

Pathetic.", "For the most part, you are correct. I am on SSDI. I don\u2019t qualify for SSI because I have life insurance. People who receive SSI get more than I do. I don\u2019t understand why having life insurance changes things. I will never see that money because it is designed to pay funeral costs. That means I have to pay the Part B premium. It\u2019s a joke when they announce the \u201craise.\u201d That raise usually pays for the increase in that premium. Anyone on SSI, SSDI, SSI or equivalent loses spendable money each year because everything else goes up while this stays the same leaving us in extremely low poverty. \n\nThe cash on hand stated above is incorrect. \n\nSSI can only have $2000 total in all accounts. You want to save more, buy a safe or put cash in a safety deposit box. That nugget came from a social security rep. \n\nSSDI does not have a restriction on assets. This payment is dependent on how much you have worked and earned. For myself I stayed home with my children. Because of that my paycheck is low because my income was nonexistent. When you get to retirement age, SSDI automatically turns to social security. Unless you can go off another record, the money received will stay the same. For instance the husband has been working all this time. This means he will be eligible for a higher payout. The wife has to go off her record until age 62 (or SSI if wife has not worked). When the wife reaches age 62, she can then apply to receive social security off the husbands record. Assuming the husband is living the wife we\u2019ll receive half of his calculated SS pay. If the husband has died, the wife will receive the amount the husband would have received. \n\nNow\u2026 this is my understanding. I have attempted to explain the very basics. Social Security has many programs. Some you may qualify for. Others you may if this and that holds true but not this or maybe that and something else will cause more confusion so you have no idea what is going on. Except you know you qualify for something and you hope the person helping you know what they are doing so you get the maximum you can get.
