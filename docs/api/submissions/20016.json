{"id": 20016, "submission_id": "14cz0ir", "title": "AITA for telling my teenage cousin that she ate too much ?", "selftext": "I (27F) just recently got my first \"big girl job\", and to celebrate I threw a bbq party at my parents' house (I paid for everything, just used their backyard). I invited all my friends as well as all of my extended family that lives nearby, one of which is Shay(17F), my cousin. Now Shay is a big eater, her parents have taken her to doctors and therapy for it but she herself doesn't think there is an issue because she's not THAT overweight, so her behaviour hasn't changed.  When I say big eater, I mean she will go for third and fourth servings while everybody at the table is still on their first. Her parents thought she had an eating disorder/was throwing up her food, but that wasn't the case.\n\nAnyways, the bbq went great, and at the end of the night everybody went back home except for Shay and her parents because they had drank a bit too much and were unable to drive, so they stayed over. We cleaned everything up, packaged and organized the leftovers, ate dinner, watched movies, and then went to sleep.\n\nI woke up today ready to go back to my own place, and wanted to take some of the bbq's leftovers with me to eat as lunch for monday and tuesday (I had mentioned planning to do this, as did my dad, during dinner) . Except, there were none left, and the sink was filled with dirty dishes.\n\nI went to the living room looking for my mom but found Shay, so I asked her if she knew what happened to the leftovers, she acted sheepish and said she was the one who ate them, that she kept getting up at night because she was hungry since she hadn't eaten well during dinner (a lie, she had three servings of lasagna). I couldn't believe what I was hearing, I asked her if she was serious, if she ate all that? And she said yes, that it wasn't THAT much. I lost it at that point and told her that no, it was a lot actually., and that she ate a lot. She went to look for her parents and told my aunt, and they left shortly after while giving me the stink eye and refusing to talk to me. My mother then came down and rained hell on me, telling me I was messing with a young girl's self-image and that I should know better, that she was in a very fragile emotional state because she was a teenager and that I should be more compassionate and less of a jerk.\n\nMy aunt then sent me a big ass text later in the day basically being very cross with me, saying she'd never denied me food when I was at her house and the fact I wanted to do so to her daughter was disheartening. I tried to get my best friend's opinion on this before doing anything, and while she agrees that I'm in the right, she said addressing it didn't really change anything so wasn't needed. I feel like I'm in lalaland, was I in the wrong? Is this normal? Am I the asshole here ?\n\nFor context, these are the leftovers she ate: two potato salad dishes, half a mac and cheese tray, 6 hot dogs, 4 chicken stuffed hawaian rolls, a whole pot of patatas bravas, a bunch of grilled sausages, a bunch of kebab skewers,  and about 2-3 pear pie slices. Only thing she left was the coleslaw. And no, nobody ate anything (I asked), just her.\n\nEdit: just got a redditcares message over this, I've no idea why.", "created_utc": 1687132556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cz0ir/aita_for_telling_my_teenage_cousin_that_she_ate/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I say this as someone who struggles with binge eating disorder. It\u2019s possible to have the binging without the purging, and it\u2019s still disordered eating in need of addressing.\n\nEating the amount of food she ate, and the fact that it happened while she was  alone at night says to me that she ate that much because she had no control over herself/could not get herself to stop until there was nothing left to eat. It sounds like compulsive eating.\n\nI\u2019m going to say NAH. You were right that she ate a large amount \u2014 an unhealthy amount. It was fair to be upset that she went through all your leftovers and left nothing. Though I explained above that she was likely acting compulsively while she ate and couldn\u2019t control herself when presented with so much food, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be upset about the outcome and it\u2019s impact on your plans. The fact that she could not control herself is a problem.\n\nI\u2019m saying NAH instead of N T A bc I understand the way her mother reacted. I think her response to you confronting her daughter for over-eating is appropriate for a mother who cares about her daughter\u2019s self image, especially if she has tried to get her daughter help with her binge eating in the past and was essentially told by professionals that there was not a problem. Speaking as someone who struggles with binge eating, the behavior comes with a lot of shame and self-loathing about one\u2019s inability to control themselves. It is logical to imagine that being confronted about a major binge was scary and stressful for your cousin; it is therefore also logical for her mother to have reacted by trying to protect and defend her daughter.\n\nOverall, I think you saying what you did will ultimately be a positive, as hopefully it will cause your cousin and her mother to reflect about the nature of her eating habits. At the same time, this does not change the fact that this confrontation was likely an extremely distressing experience for your cousin, one that will haunt her for a long time, at least until she gets help for her disorder. I therefore do not think your aunt\u2019s reaction was asshole-ish when put in the context of a loving mother who cares about how her daughter feels.", "NAH. It's understandable for you to be annoyed, but also your cousin is definitely unwell with either a binge eating disorder or something medical (I know you said they've been to the doctor already but I do think they should be continuing to investigate this).   \n\n\nApologise and agree that you shouldn't have flew off the handle like you did and move on from the situation. In the future you may have to find other ways of storing leftovers until Shay can get her eating under control because this isn't healthy for her and it's unfair on you.", "Gonna say you set yourself up to be the a hole, by inviting someone with an extreme appetite that you knew about. I get that it might have been hard to not include them without hard feelings. The only thing I see, is lesson learned. If invited again and they drink too much, see that they go home, even if they have to take Uber. And pack food away in coolers and drag them into your room. Lock the door. I always say others are welcomed to food except what I have hidden. If it\u2019s on display, oh well. Padlock a cooler she might figure out how to open it. Hide, hide, hide.

And growing children need to eat more than you think, but iirc she is 15, so still a \"child\" in the growing sense as she probably has another growth spurt or two but she I'd old enough to understand that isn't acceptable, eating other people's leftovers that they paid for.\n\nHowever the cousin didn't handle it well either, but we don't know how to conversation actually went. \n\nIf you were accusatory and didn't accept an apology and berated her, you are wrong for that, even though you are eight in being upset, which I understand as you paid for the food and wanted some to bring home and counting on a good meal really sucks when you don't get it, I just hope OP didn't let the frustration cloud her judgment.\n\nYou need to try to \"fix\" this either way, it's easy for reddit strangers to say \"fuck your cousin and your aunt, don't need them\" but there is something to being cordial especially with family, qtleast family you wanted, or atleast felt like should have been invited. \n\n\nTake this into consideration in the future and make you and your family plates/dishes with your names on them, avoids confusion during family dinners like that, and you have much more of a leg to stand on especially with your aunt. Because if she in fact fed you as a child, she has a point in that her daughter shouldn't be afraid to eat food, but obviously there is a limit and \"social rules\" to follow with that. Rules your cousin should follow I mean.\n\n\nI feel for you OP, I also feel for your cousin, if she was in fact embarrassed she could have a disorder. Try and see if your cousin sees where she went wrong, if not, then maybe you can consider a oiling them.", "A teenager should not be in competitive eating. This sounds like a binge eating disorder and her parents are enabling her. You are NTA, but I wouldn\u2019t call your cousin AH, her parents are. She needs medical help.", "Unless she\u2019s 6\u20193 and built like a strongman she\u2019s severely overweight. Sounds like she has some underlying issues that need to be addressed. You could\u2019ve handled it a bit better but god damn that\u2019s a lot of food.", "Well.... a 250 pound teenage girl unless she's taller than me that is really obese. Not in a asshole way that isn't healthy for a 15 year old unless she's like 6'5\" and that's still big as fuck.  Unless she is abnormally muscular.\n\n\nUgh, this is difficult. I don't know how you truly went about it, but I can imagine you were frustrated at the time and possibly berated her. Whether she deserved it or not that's gonna cause problems.\n\nNext time (yeah I know, kind of a one time thing for your job party but in general wirh big family dinners) maybe try labeling plates, that way there is NO confusion. If she had eaten food labeled for you her mother wouldn't have a leg to stand on (not that I necessarily think she does now)\n\n\nNTA, but a some prep work might have saved you a headache.", "You said she\u2019s not \u201cvery overweight\u201d?!  250 lbs is going to be morbidly obese on any teenage girl!  If your family doesn\u2019t realize that\u2019s insanely overweight, probably at least a hundred lbs depending on her height\u2026I\u2019m side eyeing everyone\u2019s relationship with food in this story", "Honestly, this is extremely sad. I feel really bad for Shay.\n\nThis isn't good for her. I know how it feels to have a food addiction/eating disorder. It's awful.\n\nImo this is above reddits pay grade. I wish her and you luck.", "Christ. That mother needs to be carrying around a supermarket trolley of food then. \n\nIt's unacceptable to expect others to cater for this extreme love of food that is a cost and inconvenience to others.", "Unless she is over 6 feet tall, 250 pounds is unhealthy. Especially since she has high blood pressure and is at risk of developing diabetes.", "My nephew is the same, he's been diagnosed with an eating disorder as well as asd. He binge eats", "She doesn\u2019t think being morbidly obese is a reason?? Because 250lbs at 15 years is horrible for her health. They seem seriously in denial.", "This exactly. NTA OP. It\u2019s not her fault she has an eating disorder, but it is her responsibility to manage it, and her parents\u2019. And leaving all the dirty dishes was an extra rude move on her part. That is not typical guest behaviour, especially since the parents crashed the night as well from not even having a designated driver, and also not controlling their own drinking. Totally persona non grata behaviour.", "I'm not suggesting she skate through without consequences - she 100% needs help. It can simply be communicated different ways.", "Probably worth adding that to your main post because that might change the judgement.  Then it's not leftovers, it's food specifically ear-marked for yourself.", ">I hate this tortured language people insist on using these days\n\nIt's more that it's irrelevant to the question.  Happy to change \"based on her food choices\" to \"based on what she ate\" but it doesn't make a difference.  Either the leftovers were ear-marked for OP to use later and **everyone knew i**t, or they weren't.  That's all that matters in this one.\n\nFrom OP's response it looks like they were, but she omitted that from her post.", "Prader-Willi is usually accompanied with many other disablities and I think the family would have noticed other symptomes by now. \n\nI do agree the eating is problematic though and seems very compulsive. Very worrisome.", "yeah; that\u2019s so much food it makes it feel over the top and fake. And i have been overweight and a binge eater for a big portion of my life.", "Except for the fact that she's not very overweight. Regardless, her parents are definitely TA for not taking her to the hospital because no one, growing teenager or not, would eat that amount of food without having a medical condition.", "She didn't offer an apology for me to accept in the first place. I asked if she knew what happened to the food, she said ah yeah I kinda kept getting hungry and waking up so I took some, I asked her if she knew who took the rest, she replied that nobody took anything aside from her and that there wasn't much food to begin with. At that point I told her that it was actually a lot of food, because I was the one who put it away and and took note of everything that was left so I could split it between us. I then asked if she ate everything because I was in disbelief, she confirmed and yet again said there wasn't a lot. That's where I told her it was actually a lot, and that she did eat a lot. \n\nSorry for the long convoluted answer, but I wanted to detail everything said. \n\nAnd I'm not planning on hosting anything else anytime soon, but if I do I'm picking up whatever leftovers I want and locking them somewhere that way a situation like this can be avoided from the getgo.", "It\u2019s healthy and normal to be hungry throughout the day. Its perfectly fine to let a child be slightly hungry between meals. Why would you NEVER allow a child to be hungry? Humans weren\u2019t designed to be constantly stuffed full like so many are these days. Kids especially need to be allowed to develop appropriate body regulating habits.", "Look up Molly Schuyler on YouTube.  She's 5'6, about 120 pounds and has a 16 pounds stomach capacity for competitive food eating/competitions. I saw her live at. A burger eating contest back in 2018, she finished a 5 pound burger and 1 pound of fries in less than 2 minutes...1:53 seconds to be exact.", "I personally think she is overweight, and that is fully her and her family's business that I will never get involved with or comment on. The \"not THAT overweight\" comment is just me repeating what Shay says.", "She\u2019s 250 pounds. Unless she\u2019s 7 feet tall, she\u2019s morbidly obese.", "I hate to say it but no amount of comments will allow us to truly enderstand the situation. \n\n\nAnother person tried to claim me saying children shouldn't go hungry means I beilive they should stuff their face with every craving, not the case. And I hate to say it, when I mean hungry, a 250 pound 15 year old girl is NOT hungry and doesn't look it. \n\nI mean, as you said she didn't seem to see a problem with her actions, which is shitty. Especially knowing you paid for everything, but just as much as her, I would guess her aunt is also to blame due to enabling. \n\nI don't side with you, I don't side with anyone. However I don't know if you mentioned you had a list you wrote down to split food up in the original post(I could have missed it). That's basically what I said so you absolutely have a leg to stand on. Meaning something to point at and ask the mother why she would do that. Not morally, you're good \"morally\" in my opinion, I was just trying to help you avoid similar situations in the future. \n\n\nMaybe just drop it, you aren't gonna change anything at this point, probably about a decade late, it sucks but maybe don't invite them \"next\" time, as I said in my original comment I'm well aware you only get one job change dinner especially being way older like you are. But as shitty as it is, the cakes been ate (ok I'll stop)\n\n\nI feel 4 ya, I'm not calling you an AH either, I was just bouncing ideas around to avoid this, which it seems like you tried.", "Are you stupid? \n  It is not normal to be hungry throughout the day. You seem like you've never had to deal with hunger. \n\nI didn't say you stuff your face with every craving you have, let's try to use some common sense here before you make yourself look affluent in the absolute worst way possible.\n\nYeah. Your definition of hungry is when you're bored and need something to do, when I say hunger, I mean HUNGER and its something you wouldn't understand until you've had to deal with it so consider yourself lucky. But don't think everyone had it as easy as you did just because you had to be cut off from the dorito bag and soda as a kid haha.", "That\u2019s crazy lmao, I can\u2019t imagine eating that much.", "Competitive eaters definitely purge after these kind of events.", "I do not believe that competitive eaters don't purge, especially those with low weights and smaller frames", "Kid has an eating disorder and her parents are delusional. NAH except shays mom and dad.", "It actually is entirely normal to go several hours between meals, even if you feel slightly hungry in that time. The only time it might be an issue is if one has a metabolic disorder (like diabetes or hyperthyroid).", ">You seem like you've never had to deal with hunger.\n\nI think the same could be said for the OP's cousin though.", "I didn't say that competitive eaters don't purge, I'm saying they have the capacity to eat that much in one sitting."]}
