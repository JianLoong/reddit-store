{"id": 20016, "submission_id": "14cz0ir", "title": "AITA for telling my teenage cousin that she ate too much ?", "selftext": "I (27F) just recently got my first \"big girl job\", and to celebrate I threw a bbq party at my parents' house (I paid for everything, just used their backyard). I invited all my friends as well as all of my extended family that lives nearby, one of which is Shay(17F), my cousin. Now Shay is a big eater, her parents have taken her to doctors and therapy for it but she herself doesn't think there is an issue because she's not THAT overweight, so her behaviour hasn't changed.  When I say big eater, I mean she will go for third and fourth servings while everybody at the table is still on their first. Her parents thought she had an eating disorder/was throwing up her food, but that wasn't the case.\n\nAnyways, the bbq went great, and at the end of the night everybody went back home except for Shay and her parents because they had drank a bit too much and were unable to drive, so they stayed over. We cleaned everything up, packaged and organized the leftovers, ate dinner, watched movies, and then went to sleep.\n\nI woke up today ready to go back to my own place, and wanted to take some of the bbq's leftovers with me to eat as lunch for monday and tuesday (I had mentioned planning to do this, as did my dad, during dinner) . Except, there were none left, and the sink was filled with dirty dishes.\n\nI went to the living room looking for my mom but found Shay, so I asked her if she knew what happened to the leftovers, she acted sheepish and said she was the one who ate them, that she kept getting up at night because she was hungry since she hadn't eaten well during dinner (a lie, she had three servings of lasagna). I couldn't believe what I was hearing, I asked her if she was serious, if she ate all that? And she said yes, that it wasn't THAT much. I lost it at that point and told her that no, it was a lot actually., and that she ate a lot. She went to look for her parents and told my aunt, and they left shortly after while giving me the stink eye and refusing to talk to me. My mother then came down and rained hell on me, telling me I was messing with a young girl's self-image and that I should know better, that she was in a very fragile emotional state because she was a teenager and that I should be more compassionate and less of a jerk.\n\nMy aunt then sent me a big ass text later in the day basically being very cross with me, saying she'd never denied me food when I was at her house and the fact I wanted to do so to her daughter was disheartening. I tried to get my best friend's opinion on this before doing anything, and while she agrees that I'm in the right, she said addressing it didn't really change anything so wasn't needed. I feel like I'm in lalaland, was I in the wrong? Is this normal? Am I the asshole here ?\n\nFor context, these are the leftovers she ate: two potato salad dishes, half a mac and cheese tray, 6 hot dogs, 4 chicken stuffed hawaian rolls, a whole pot of patatas bravas, a bunch of grilled sausages, a bunch of kebab skewers,  and about 2-3 pear pie slices. Only thing she left was the coleslaw. And no, nobody ate anything (I asked), just her.\n\nEdit: just got a redditcares message over this, I've no idea why.", "created_utc": 1687132556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cz0ir/aita_for_telling_my_teenage_cousin_that_she_ate/", "score": 558, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I say this as someone who struggles with binge eating disorder. It\u2019s possible to have the binging without the purging, and it\u2019s still disordered eating in need of addressing.\n\nEating the amount of food she ate, and the fact that it happened while she was  alone at night says to me that she ate that much because she had no control over herself/could not get herself to stop until there was nothing left to eat. It sounds like compulsive eating.\n\nI\u2019m going to say NAH. You were right that she ate a large amount \u2014 an unhealthy amount. It was fair to be upset that she went through all your leftovers and left nothing. Though I explained above that she was likely acting compulsively while she ate and couldn\u2019t control herself when presented with so much food, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be upset about the outcome and it\u2019s impact on your plans. The fact that she could not control herself is a problem.\n\nI\u2019m saying NAH instead of N T A bc I understand the way her mother reacted. I think her response to you confronting her daughter for over-eating is appropriate for a mother who cares about her daughter\u2019s self image, especially if she has tried to get her daughter help with her binge eating in the past and was essentially told by professionals that there was not a problem. Speaking as someone who struggles with binge eating, the behavior comes with a lot of shame and self-loathing about one\u2019s inability to control themselves. It is logical to imagine that being confronted about a major binge was scary and stressful for your cousin; it is therefore also logical for her mother to have reacted by trying to protect and defend her daughter.\n\nOverall, I think you saying what you did will ultimately be a positive, as hopefully it will cause your cousin and her mother to reflect about the nature of her eating habits. At the same time, this does not change the fact that this confrontation was likely an extremely distressing experience for your cousin, one that will haunt her for a long time, at least until she gets help for her disorder. I therefore do not think your aunt\u2019s reaction was asshole-ish when put in the context of a loving mother who cares about how her daughter feels.", "NAH. It's understandable for you to be annoyed, but also your cousin is definitely unwell with either a binge eating disorder or something medical (I know you said they've been to the doctor already but I do think they should be continuing to investigate this).   \n\n\nApologise and agree that you shouldn't have flew off the handle like you did and move on from the situation. In the future you may have to find other ways of storing leftovers until Shay can get her eating under control because this isn't healthy for her and it's unfair on you.", "Gonna say you set yourself up to be the a hole, by inviting someone with an extreme appetite that you knew about. I get that it might have been hard to not include them without hard feelings. The only thing I see, is lesson learned. If invited again and they drink too much, see that they go home, even if they have to take Uber. And pack food away in coolers and drag them into your room. Lock the door. I always say others are welcomed to food except what I have hidden. If it\u2019s on display, oh well. Padlock a cooler she might figure out how to open it. Hide, hide, hide.
