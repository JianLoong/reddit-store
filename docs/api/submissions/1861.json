But your roommate trivialized a very profound, traumatic experience: ***\"Oh, I wish I could have nearly died....\"***!!!\n\nWhat sort of nonsense is that?\n\nYou did well to set them straight.

Would they say to a person with a physical disability \"Man, I wish I didn't have a leg so I could (have x)\" ?\n\nI mean, people do say those sorts of things but that makes them ignorant AH", "NTA. Your roommate threw your trauma in your face like it was some sort of joke. Don't think for a second you are in the wrong here, your response (both tone and content) was perfectly reasonable, given the circumstances. You are not the one who should apologize, she should have - right after she saw how she hurt you with her comment.", "NTA\n\nYour roommate should have NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER ever joked about your experience. One of my uncles nearly died this week and I would have been pissed as all hell if someone said this to him. Do not give an apology that isn't deserved.", "NTA. They made a tasteless and ignorant comment and absolutely deserved to be called out for it. They owe you an apology - you do not owe them one.", "NTA, and your roommate needed a reality check. Full disclosure tho: I might be biased because I have cptsd (no near death). Maybe you could sit them down and talk to them once more, because maybe when you screamed they didn't even catch the message. And tell them that you are sorry for screaming, and would welcome an apology from them for being so insensitive.", "Nta, that is a very insensitive thing to say to someone, who went though something that traumatizing, I really hope your roommate was just being ignorant in the moment.", "I don't think you're an ah, you snapped after receiving a HORRIBLE and DISGUSTING comment and that is a normal reaction especially after something so insane happened to you. I think it would be a good idea to talk to her. Maybe not an apology but just a discussion. You can say you feel bad for yelling but you meant what you said and you don't want to hear stuff like that.", "NTA - best course would be to apologize to your roommate for how you acted but not for what you said.  He had that coming.", "NTA but keep being someone who tries their best not to shout at people as it speaks well of you.", "You were triggered and reacted badly if understandably. I think apologizing for overreacting would be fine. No long explanations needed. Just, \"I'm sorry about the way I reacted last week.\" They're going to have feelings about this, too, and may need to express them. Don't get caught up in a big discussion about it but do try to hear them out. Maybe they'll apologize, too.", "As someone who has had a near death experience and PTSD from it NTA and good job explaining to them that they have NO idea what they\u2019re talking about.", "NTA. They were being immature and callous.", "You are right, but they are ignorant, not malicious. They cannot help that they do not know how severe it was for you. You could apologise for biting their head off without compromising the truth of what you said.", "Joe rogan said it best: \"friends dont let friends say stupid shit and get away with it\".", "YTA. Your roommate said something stupid and he was thinking about himself, not you. You could have corrected his misconception without shouting and swearing at him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ignorance needs education.", "A little bit ESH, though you have more of an excuse, it's something that you're going to have to stop doing at some point if you don't want your trauma to become a cycle.\nIt's normal for survivors to lash out disproportionately at small and triggering things, often at other traumatized and/or mentally unwell individuals, PTSD support groups are cesspools of it and they're biased in your favor now but if you keep trusting them one of them will do to you what you did to your roommate, 300% guarantee it.\nWhat your roommate said was fucked up but so was what you said directly before it, you were implying your trauma made you 'better' than them which is an understandable coping mechanism when people trivialize and don't understand what you've been through. And it's not a competition. It doesn't mean they can't ever complain. You won't like it when you're on the receiving end as you'll probably find out sooner or later because your social circle includes a bunch of people who have developed the exact same coping mechanism"]}
