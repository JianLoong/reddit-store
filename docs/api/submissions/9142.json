It's about the people, not the appearance, folks.", "Yeah. My father gave us a reason to think about that from the very beginning. He offered us either a big wedding at his expense, or else help with our expenses during my fianc\u00e9's last few years of graduate school. And the way he phrased it was, \"It's up to you, but I can either invest in the wedding or the marriage.\" \n\nIt reminded us, if we'd ever been in any danger of forgetting, that the marriage was the important part. A wedding is important only *because* it's the ceremonial beginning of a marriage. I don't know that we'd have forgotten either way, but we made the smart move and asked for help with the marriage. It affected our wedding budget, sure; but it also affected the choices we made for it. \n\nEven though I'm long since divorced and remarried, I have almost as happy memories of my first wedding as I do of my second... because we were surrounded by love, and it showed in all the details. I don't remember what anybody looked like, but I do remember that my mother's best friend did my hair and makeup, or that my mom wrote out our invitations by hand on card stock, in her perfect copperplate handwriting, instead of getting something engraved. I remember that one of my friends who'd gotten married recently appointed herself in charge of making sure that I ate and drank because the bride never has time to otherwise. The only people whose appearance I remember are mine and my groom's, because that's who I was looking at most of the time. \ud83d\ude42", "Shave your hair, why do you want pubes on your head?

But someone who demands that a groomsman shave his beard for \"the aesthetic\" is absolutely the kind of person to pitch a bitchfit about uneven numbers. (Hence why I added quotes around \"have to\" in my original comment. She's more obsessed about having the perfect look for Insta or other SM or whatever than she is about including people they care about, as they are. It's fucking ridiculous.)", "I am super confused by this. Married (twice) never heard of it.", "NTA. \n\nThis isn't a reasonable request and you certainly don't wait until the day before the wedding to make it. It's your body, your choice and those that don't like it can kick rocks. \n\nYou offered a reasonable compromise (moreso if you've already financially committed by renting a suit) and it was rebuffed.

What is it with these insane brides that think wedding photos should look like everyone in them are clones.

Please do not shave your scruff.", "It's a bit of a balancing act.\n\nThere are perfectly reasonable aesthetic requests: setting the level of formality, wedding party is expected to wear certain outfits, white being reserved for the bride, and everyone being clean and well-groomed. \n\nThough I think how someone is when you ask them to be in the wedding party determines what a reasonable expectation is on the wedding day. If the MoH has had blue hair for the past decade, then it's not reasonable to expect her to dye it a natural color. If her hair was a natural color (and a desire to dye it was not expressed when she accepted the role), then it would be understandably upsetting if the she suddenly dyed it blue.\n\nFor OP, it's reasonable to expect that his beard will be trimmed and groomed, but it's unreasonable to expect him to shave.", "I can imagine: dye your hair because you are the only ginger! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "as long as he doesn't have a beard it'll be fine. \ud83d\ude1c", "Don't present an out for them - what if she then suggests make up?", "Ask if she would force her bridesmaids to wear a wig or get a haircut if one of them didn't match.\n\nSuch gross entitled behavior.
