It's about the people, not the appearance, folks.", "Yeah. My father gave us a reason to think about that from the very beginning. He offered us either a big wedding at his expense, or else help with our expenses during my fianc\u00e9's last few years of graduate school. And the way he phrased it was, \"It's up to you, but I can either invest in the wedding or the marriage.\" \n\nIt reminded us, if we'd ever been in any danger of forgetting, that the marriage was the important part. A wedding is important only *because* it's the ceremonial beginning of a marriage. I don't know that we'd have forgotten either way, but we made the smart move and asked for help with the marriage. It affected our wedding budget, sure; but it also affected the choices we made for it. \n\nEven though I'm long since divorced and remarried, I have almost as happy memories of my first wedding as I do of my second... because we were surrounded by love, and it showed in all the details. I don't remember what anybody looked like, but I do remember that my mother's best friend did my hair and makeup, or that my mom wrote out our invitations by hand on card stock, in her perfect copperplate handwriting, instead of getting something engraved. I remember that one of my friends who'd gotten married recently appointed herself in charge of making sure that I ate and drank because the bride never has time to otherwise. The only people whose appearance I remember are mine and my groom's, because that's who I was looking at most of the time. \ud83d\ude42", "Shave your hair, why do you want pubes on your head?

But someone who demands that a groomsman shave his beard for \"the aesthetic\" is absolutely the kind of person to pitch a bitchfit about uneven numbers.

She's more obsessed about having the perfect look for Insta or other SM or whatever than she is about including people they care about, as they are. It's fucking ridiculous.)", "I am super confused by this. Married (twice) never heard of it."]}
