Prom tickets were $100 each when I was going to high school since it was held in a upscale hotel ballroom, tux rental, corsage and possibly a limo rental as well.

Just ignore her.", "Nope, NTA.\n\nHope you have a good time at the prom.", "NTA, but your ex is a **massive** one.

If I didn\u2019t contribute to the tickets, I would have no right to them.", "NTA, if a relationship ends then it is normally not expected that one would share purchased tickets or pay for unused clothes. I have some empathy with the ex who now realizes she has no one to go to prom with and is embarrassed that OP is very publicly moving forward with his life. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t change the fact you don\u2019t have to pay for dates that don\u2019t happen, especially if both parties agree to part ways.", "Nta you bought the tickets with your own money. Your not with her so she is not entitled to your ticket. It doesn't matter if you plan to take her when you both were dating but your not dating now. So it makes no sense that she thinks she was still going. You have ever right to go to prom with who ever you want. That's your ticket and you can take whoever you want. Your ex is not entitled to your stuff.", "NTA\n\nYou bought the Tickets with your Money and did Not give her one yet.\n\nThey are all yours and you can do whatever you want with them.\n\nSince you arent a couple anymore she has No rights at all to demand one for herself", "NTA. Hey they\u2019re both your tickets, enjoy them in any way you like!!", "NTA you bought a ticket for your date. She is no longer your date\u2026", "NTA. Your tickets you don\u2019t owe your ex girlfriend anything.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI had a similar thing happen to me back in the day, except the ex was smart enough to 'get back together' with me just before prom and thereby preserve her trip to the prom.   \n\n\nThankfully, you're not in the position (don't fall for it when she inevitably arrives at the same plan!)  \n\n\nLeave your ex behind and have a nice night with your friend. And hey, you never know if that nice prom night might blossom into more than a friendship down the road.", "Lol - it is good to be young! Your NTA and high school will be over forever. You might be surprised how quickly those people fade from your life. Heck I left town over 40 years ago - never been back. So take her with a grain of salt, have a good time with a friend and be careful on the roads. Remember you guys are all amateur drivers ok.", "NTA, the ticket was bought for the one that was going to accompany you to the prom.  She is not that one. She did not pay for the ticket. She has no claim to it.", "And the lesson is to all parents, buy your kid their own ticket to school dances so that this does not happen. I do this for this exact reason.", "NTA. She is your ex. Why would you give her the prom ticket? You bought them and are no longer together. Ignore her.", "NTA - Sounds like your Ex got a little lesson in humble pie. \n\nI skipped my prom, so I hope you have a great time bud.", "NTA,\n\nDid she pay for the ticket? No\n\nDid you hand her the ticket? No\n\nDid you promise her the ticket AFTER said break up? No\n\nSounds like a her problem", "Not sure how schools are supposed to cover the cost then.", "They said in the post that the deadline to get them passed. So they are not selling them anymore.\n\nIf she wanted a ticket, she should have offered to buy it off of him in my opinion.", "Remember One Tree Hill? Damn want to watch that again just for the drama.", "He has someone else to go with now. Why is she more entitled to go to prom than his new date?", "If it\u2019s HER prom, why doesn\u2019t SHE have HER OWN ticket? It doesn\u2019t matter why they split up (and OP absolutely could be the AH there), she\u2019s still not entitled to a ticket purchased by someone who isn\u2019t her, and who never gave her the ticket.", "My Midwestern high school did not charge for attending.   \n\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why the school would cut off ticket sales anyway. Why would they do that? Wouldn't they have planned a big enough event for everyone?", "My school's proms were funded through fundraising done by the junior class (who then were in charge of theme and decorating). It was a huge honor.", "Okay yeah I definitely missed that part. Sucks for her but she's still an ass for not asking if she could buy it.", "OP bought the ticket for his date to the prom.\n\nEx ended her being his date so he has a spare ticket.", "I was thinking the same thing reading this. I use to think I be through the high school drama only to realize when you work you deal with work drama and bill shit.", "Well, this kinda depends on where the prom is. My high-school prom was at a golf club house, not the school, so a ticket cutoff is needed to let the venue and the catering company know how many people are there a head of time.", "Yeah but it\u2019s not like she was some random date. They were in a relationship and had plans to go together.", "I swear to god it\u2019s easier in a tv show.", "And going together requires them to be together.\n\nIf she does not wish to be together then.....\n\nTry it a different way if op rented a limo for his date and they split does he need to provide a limo ride still?", "Bad example. You can\u2019t split a limo ride like you can split tickets.", "Why not?\n\nOp would in theory pay for both.\n\nEx didn't fund either.\n\nOK try it a different way\n\nIf you and your SO are going on a vacation you paid for and they broke up with you.\n\nDo you owe them the other ticket?", "If you had both planned the activities of the vacation then the right thing to do would be to figure out how to divvy things up before inviting someone else on the trip, yes. Of course, ex girlfriend would be responsible for paying every penny of what she wanted to \u201cclaim\u201d out of the \u201csettlement\u201d.", "Ya no\n\nShe hadn't offered to pay op yet she wasn't planning to. \n\nOp enjoy prom with your friend", "NTA. You bought a ticket for your date. She is no longer that person", "YTA because the deadline to buy a ticket is passed.  She planned on going and made purchases based on that fact.  You should have given her a chance to buy the ticket from you.\nYour actions took away her chance to go to prom. Is this her senior prom too? Taking that away from her is a real dick move.\nThe only exception I see is if it ended because she was cheating. Then you owe her nothing.", "ESH - you, your ex, the school. \n\nIf your ex already could not buy a replacement ticket for herself at the point at which you broke up, which sounds like it is the case, it would have been much more reasonable to offer her an opportunity to buy the ticket from you. \nParticularly as you \u201cgave the ticket away\u201d to your new date. This suggests the implication when your ex as going to go with you that you would also have \u201cgiven\u201d the ticket to her as your date, and rescinding the implied gift is unkind. Particularly as it means she can no longer attend an important coming of age ritual. \n\nHaving not done that, and she herself not having asked if she could buy it from you, she had no business screaming at you about it.  \n\nThe school should allow some tickets to be sold close to the event, or require tickets be named if they\u2019re for members of the class, to prevent them from missing out in these kinds of situations.", "YTA. You should have offered to sell it to her - it is understandable that you would not go together, but the morally right thing to do would have been to offer her to buy the ticket off you so she does not miss out on going to prom. Of course you are \u201clegally\u201d in the clear, doesn\u2019t make this any less of a petty, childish move.", "NTA you already invited someone else. Her problems aren\u2019t your problems. It sucks if she can\u2019t  go but she needs to figure that out. She should have asked you about it when you broke up and she should have reimbursed you for the ticket then. Don\u2019t sweat it", "NTA, you bought the ticket so you could take a date. When was the cutoff for buying the tickets?  Looks like she was hoping to get a new date and when that failed she is taking it out on you.", "NTA. That ticket was bought for your date. She is no longer your date..", "I would go to the school or prom committee for resolution", "Wow. The entitlement starts EARLY with that one. NTA. Your money, your tickets.", "NTA. Keep your head high, king. No time for garden tools", "Info: did you offer to her to buy it off you/ did she ask to?", "NTA. Sucks to be her. She can look around for another ticket. Go and have fun with your friend. If she comes crawling, begging for you to take her back, don't do it. She'll dump you immediately after.", "NTA- your breakup was a blessing!", "INFO is it your ex girlfriends senior prom also?", "NTA based on your post, although it kinda depends on why things \u2018ended abruptly\u2019?", "NTA, legally your money closed case.", "[deleted]", "She had several option when she broke up with him. Could\u2019ve asked to go as friends or tried to buy the ticket from him. But she didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t see why op sucks", "Because the school doesn't pay for the prom. Fundraisers and ticket sales do.", "Cry harder. If she wanted the ticket she should have asked about it sooner. No one is forcing her to spend more than she can afford on prom.", "None of that actually matters though. Ultimately, she did not buy this ticket and it does not belong to her. The OP even stated they agreed to not going together. That pretty much negates anything else.\n\nI mean, of course I'm curious about more details, but those details don't change the fact he bought the tickets and never handed her a ticket. It is not hers and she has no entitlement to it.", "All of the schools in my area absolutely do. They have a limited number and sell out fast, so if you don't get your tickets right away that's just too bad.", "Ohh no, not HER prom.", "Well why couldn't SHE buy the ticket?", "[deleted]", "It makes no difference at all. Whether she cheated, he cheated, no one cheated, it only makes a difference because you want to attach an emotion to something that is clearly transactional. This person bought 2 tickets to an event and mutually agreed they would no longer be going together.\n\nYou can throw all the emotion and feelings you want at it, but at the end of the day, it remains the same. A transaction. I'm not saying the ex is a bad person or that she deserves any ill will. I've only ever pointed out that it was never her ticket and she shouldn't have assumed it was.\n\nI will say though, it doesn't sit well with me that she opted to wait until he gave the ticket to someone else to care so much about it.", "Definitely agree with you...tickets were purchased by OP for him and his date, whoever that was going to be.  OP is NTA and his ex is shit-outta luck!", "Wow, fancy! I suppose I can understand needing tickets for that kind of event. \n\nFor my school, we just planned for pretty much everyone to come in the upper classes (plus some extra for out of school dates).", "I wish we did that, probably would've save me $80 \ud83d\udc80", "Holy moly you paid that much for tickets, on top of the cost of everything else (dress/tux, ride, dinner, ect)? Yikes! At my school, prom was the junior class project. They did all the fundraising, planning, decorating, etc. I didn't realize what a deal we had until now.", "Yep. Although I got lucky with timing. My suit was the same one I wore the week before at my cousins wedding, dinner was included in the price of the ticket, and I had a car I bought the year before", "That idea that you had is so fucking stupid. Person B, who did not pay, is not obligated to go on the vacation, even if they did eventually pay their share. Planning a vacation doesn't entitle you to a vacation, unless you are a business that plans vacations."]}
