I didn\u2019t buy it.", "Why should he?", "As a formal high school girl myself I\u2019m not sure I agree, as you can\u2019t perpetuate a cycle of breaking up/getting back together all by your onesie. I also think OP should\u2019ve offered to sell the ticket to her first before giving it to someone else since they were both planning on attending prom with those specific tickets. \n\nHowever, OP implies the ex-girlfriend got mad about the tickets AFTER she found out he was taking someone else, which is what leads me to think this isn\u2019t actually about her maintaining the opportunity to attend prom, and is more centered around jealousy.", "Who cares? You keep saying it\u2019s *her* prom but it\u2019s his too. She broke up with him. He owes her nothing.", "She **could** miss HER prom because of a number of reasons, none of which are because the OP owes her anything.\n\nI don't know the circumstances of their break up, so it's not even a factor here however, the break up happened and the OP stated they had agreed not to go to prom together. She HAD an opportunity to ask for the ticket, offer to pay for the ticket, she chose not to. She waited until he had asked someone else.\n\nIf she misses HER prom, it's of her own doing.", "Boo freakin hoo.  It was never her ticket.  It was his prom dates ticket.  He owes her nothing. NTA.", "He bought tickets for his prom. She did not buy tickets for HER prom.  That sounds like a her problem,  and not his. \n\nShe didn't even ask about buying the ticket from him.  Just expecting it from him,  which is very entitled on her part.", "Once they breakup any sort of perks end. I can not see how it is OP's issue now", "If it\u2019s both of their prom and she didn\u2019t buy a ticket because they both agreed he would buy them both and now it\u2019s after the deadline I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really fair that she would miss this experience without the ability to buy a ticket through the school- she should have the opportunity to buy the ticket from him. If it\u2019s not her prom that\u2019s different. OP also says nothing about the break up so it\u2019s not even clear she did something wrong", "Plus if I am not mistaken is she is a student able to go to prom hers would be already accounted for.

Now it\u2019s too late for her to get a ticket meaning she will not be able to attend her prom.

You\u2019re inventing details.", "I think it's fair, she could have bought a ticket of her own, she chose not to. This is no different to if you buy tickets for a concert then break up. Sucks to not go, but you don't pay, you don't play.", "That\u2019s not necessarily true. My school sold tickets and any person in the grade could buy two but once ticket sales ended that was it and you couldn\u2019t go without a ticket", "At my school,  everyone had to buy the tickets per person.  If you wanted someone from outside the school,  there was a whole process to get that approved...", "No it ain't an AH move, he bought the tickets, he decides who uses them. This is no different to a concert that's a once in a lifetime, she wanted to go? She should have bought the ticket.", "It\u2019s also ah move to break up with someone a week before and event", "I don't believe he \"uninvited\" her. In the original post it states:  \n\n\n>we decided not to go together\n\nShe knew she wasn't going, at least not with the OP. If she assumed the ticket was hers, that's on her. An expensive lesson to learn, sure, but a lesson none-the-less.\n\nShe can sell the dress or try to return it. Or, as I suspect, she will end up at Prom regardless of this ticket. Especially if it's \"her prom too\". So she can wear the dress.", "That\u2019s what you pick up on? Who cares who broke up with who? He bought tickets to go with his girlfriend. He no longer has a girlfriend and now has an extra ticket for someone else. Ex girlfriend finds out he found someone else to go with and starts demanding ticket. It\u2019s pretty cut and dry. She\u2019s jealous he\u2019s going with someone else and now wants to ruin that.", "It may have changed it\u2019s been decades since I went to prom and well over 5 years since my kids did.", "Same with mine. And each ticket was linked to a person's name so shit like this wouldn't happen lol", "Well, 2 1/2 week before the event.  Given that he found someone to go within a week,  I would guess that ticket sales were still going at that point, and she would have likely gone by herself.", "I could understand someone giving an E S H, but I just cannot understand a N T A vote unless we get new information that he dumped the gf so OP could take girl #2. The original write-up doesn't really support that angle.", "He says things ended abruptly which I\u2019m guessing means he broke up with her or he\u2019d say she broke up with him. So yes, that basically is the equivalent of him uninviting her.", "My kid's school sold tickets on a limited basis. Seniors at the school got to buy tickets for themselves at a reduced rate two weeks earlier. However these tickets could only be used for themselves as they were printer with their name and picture - ticket and memento in one.\n\nAfter that, tickets went on sale for those bringing dates/friends from outside the Senior class or from a different school. Anyone wanting to bring someone who already graduated had to fill out a form. Only Seniors can buy tickets and there was a limit of 3 (including themselves).\n\nThe graduate class is comprised of about 550 Seniors, so they have a pretty workable solution to ensure every Senior has an opportunity if they wish to attend.", "Ya,  the tickets were more for ceremony than actually needed because they had a list of everyone going to the event.", "That's a huge assumption though. Perhaps he opted not to include who broke up with who so as not to skew the results here?\n\nEven if that is the case, we don't know the details of **why** they broke up. In any case, I don't go around paying for my ex's activities simply because things didn't work out between us. That's an absurd expectation.", "Lol I love your logic here.\n\n\"He said one thing, but rather than clarify it in gonna assume it means exactly what I already wanted it to mean.\"", "Yep. Which worked out really well for me because I forgot them at home lol", "We can agree to disagree. Prom is a big deal to high schoolers and his ex doesn\u2019t get the opportunity to go because OP refused to sell her the ticket that was meant for her. I think that makes him the AH.", "Lol, I think that was half the reason my H.S. switched over to just using a list because of all the people that had to go home,  and find the tickets.", "Of course we can agree to disagree. I'm well aware of the how important prom is to high schoolers. I don't disagree this is a really crappy lesson to learn, but it's her lesson to learn. Not his. He didn't do anything wrong based on the information provided thus far. If anything, he **could** have asked her if she wanted to buy the ticket first, but again, he was under no obligation to do so and that doesn't make him an AH.", "Except she never offered to BUY the ticket, just expected OP to give it to her. And she didn't even bring it up until AFTER he found someone else to go with. If the prom was that important to her, she would have asked him if she could buy the ticket from him right after they broke up.", "See, when he bought a ticket specifically for her, they had a verbal agreement that ticket was for her to attend prom. I don\u2019t think he had to right to take that away from her without letting her buy the ticket from him. \n\nI feel that way about all these posts around the Taylor Swift concert though. Once you tell someone you bought a ticket for them, you can\u2019t just retract that.", "You are attaching emotion to an item. When he bought the ticket, he bought it for his date. That **was** going to be her, now it's not. When I buy a ticket to a concert for my friend or family member, the assumption is that we'll be at the very least, on speaking terms and have a relatively decent relationship. Otherwise, they won't be coming with me.\n\nThe money was shelled out for the ticket by the OP. Until he hands that ticket over to the intended recipient, they are not entitled to it.\n\nIf anything, it sounds to me like she **knew** she wasn't going with him and assumed she would be getting the ticket and continued to purchase a dress etc. (Which btw, is also an assumption as for all we know, she hasn't even bought a dress yet)."]}
