Almost something really odd and ironically satisfying.", "You can sweep them off of sidewalks.", "Understandably so.\n\nAlways intruiging finding out something was created for one reason and it's turned into something else completely.", "If you are going to blow or rake then you need to dispose of them as well either by trash collection or by chipper otherwise the wind will make it utterly pointless. Do you sweep your kitchen and then leave the dust in a corner?", "I\u2019m not kidding\u2014that would be it for me. There is so much to unpack in this one act of inconsiderate idiocy that I would just leave. NTA and I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you kicked him out.", "Probably,  but your husband shouldn't have a leaf blower in the house and definitely could have been more considerate on this day. But guys are stupid, especially when dealing with emotional things and was probably trying to lighten the mood, which of course didn't work. He owes you an apology,  but come on, do you really want a relationship where you guys yell obscenities at each other, even when upset? That will just hurt your marriage.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get the joke. What was supposed to be funny about blowing a leaf blower on you? Who even thinks of such a thing?", "So he tried to scare you.\n\nYou got scared.\n\nYou reacted in a way that people do when they get scared.\n\nHe's upset?\n\nLol, is he usually brighter than this?\n\nThis was on the anniversary of your mothers death? Does he...I dont even know how to phrase it. Is he normally the sort of person who thinks pranks are a good idea when someone is emotional?", "Was that his dense way of trying to cheer you up?", "&#x200B;\n\nbecause i just found out its considered offensive;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>when you find out you are not the AH and collect home cleaning tips.  \n>  \n>haven't seen this sug united since the *(renovation story)* or ***the Iranian Yogurt***\n\ni hope Yogurt isnt offensive YET", "I just searched youtube and there\u2019s so many good ones. Highly recommend both the prank and the videos."]}
