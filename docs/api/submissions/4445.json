Who even brings a leaf blower in the house in the first place? And on today of all days?

And this was not the best of circumstances, making it an even worse joke. He's a bit AH for thinking this was a good idea and doing it on this really difficult day for you. \n\nAnd I'm sorry for your loss.  Thats a terrible tragedy.", "NTA, you have the right to feel anyway you feel on this day. He definitely needs to apologize for this one. He was probably trying to cheer you up but men are just clueless sometimes.", "NTA.\n\nA leaf blower inside the house would be my personal hell for me regardless of whether it was an anniversary of a particular day for me. They\u2019re obnoxiously loud and I just don\u2019t understand why leaves can\u2019t be raked up instead of blowing all the leaves and dust anywhere. (Yes, I know it\u2019s more work but it seems way more effective).\n\nAsk your husband to explain how the joke was funny.", "Another prank, another failure to be remotely funny. NTA. I\u2019m convinced that people who pull pranks are simply intellectually vacant.", "NTA. I get that people do dumb pranks sometimes, without considering how it could come across, but as soon as he saw your reaction, he should have apologized, not gotten mad at you for a knee-jerk, panicked reaction you probably couldn't control in the moment.", "NTA - I am also skittish like you described and even asked my husband if he would ever do that to me in a joking manner and he said he would never do that period. That it is not funny and even if I didn't scare easily he wouldn't do it.", "NTA.\n\nAs a dude, if my SO did that to me on any day, I'd be pissed. It's one thing to do a minor prank, it's another to use a loud ass leaf blower inside a house. \n\nNever mind a sensitive day.", "NTA. He can't blow your bad mood away. (sorry, couldn't help it) He was insensitive and probably trying (really poorly) to cheer you up. You two should work on communication.", "NTA\n\nSorry for the loss of your mom.", "NTA a leaf blower? Really? What is he? 15? Time to grow up, those kind of pranks are bad for the heart. You were already having an emotional day and now your AH husband thinks it be funny to give you a heart attack as a joke.

Your husband is a big AH and has an awful sense of \u201chumor.\u201d First, he knows you don\u2019t react well to being startled. Second, he knows you are grieving your mother on the first anniversary of her death. And he pulls that stunt? If that were my husband and he didn\u2019t sincerely apologize and realize he was in the wrong, we would have some SERIOUS problems ahead.", "NTA! \n\nEach day before and up until the first anniversary after the loss of a loved one, is always an extremely difficult year. You'll think, they are no longer here for the first holiday, birthday, major event, even the small stuff. It's horrible. I don't understand if your husband thought that it would make you feel better to joke with you, but that day was NOT the day to mess with you. \n\nWhat's disturbing is he should know that you are very skittish and he's claiming there was no way he could predict how you would react. Who brings and uses a leaf blower inside the house? The noise is pretty deafening too. Just not a good move on his part.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your mom. Your husband should not have done that.", ">He got upset, said that he was \u201cjust joking,\u201d and there was no way he could predict how I would respond.\n\nUh, no. He knew *exactly* how you would respond, which is *why he did it.* It was the entire point of his \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\nBtw, I also *hate* being startled and I know exactly what you mean about feeling actual pain in your chest from it. It\u2019s even worse when you are feeling emotional to begin with, as you were (with good reason) here.\n\nNTA", "Last time I behaved this badly was about age 14.

His excuses are shit, he absolutely has had every chance to know you are easily scared. It's on him if he has decided not to remember this.

I\u2019d probably murder someone over this.", "NTA he sounds like he needs his diaper changed.
