That it is not funny and even if I didn't scare easily he wouldn't do it.", "NTA.\n\nAs a dude, if my SO did that to me on any day, I'd be pissed.

Really? What is he? 15? Time to grow up, those kind of pranks are bad for the heart.

You'll think, they are no longer here for the first holiday, birthday, major event, even the small stuff. It's horrible. I don't understand if your husband thought that it would make you feel better to joke with you, but that day was NOT the day to mess with you. \n\nWhat's disturbing is he should know that you are very skittish and he's claiming there was no way he could predict how you would react.
