At least she only had one.\n\nIt's valid of her to be frustrated of course but she can't expect the world to bend to her will just because she's pregnant. And the fact she took it out on you publicly when others could've let her on too is strange and rude to me.", "NTA- I think people are forgetting that when you\u2019re considerate to the elderly, pregnant, and disabled, children are also a part of that consideration. There were nine other people on that elevator that could have gotten off. You\u2019re still a child at the end of the day.", "NTA. \n\nFirst come first serve.

First come first serve and the best part is, it comes back around! Rain sucks for everyone and it sounds like there was 9 other people who could have let her have their spot. Additionally, she\u2019s incredibly petty for calling a child out a whole day later.

I had two friends become recent mothers - one you would not have noticed she was pregnant at all, such a small neat little bump and no symptoms - baby practically fell out swiftly in the hospital car park. The other swelled up so much she resembled a weeble - had to use litter pickers to put her flip flops on. Pregnancy is also not a free pass to get ahead in lines and special treatment. It is common courtesy yes to offer a seat on a bus/ train to those less able to stand. But there it is - THOSE LESS ABLE. If she didn't know OP, OP could of had a hidden disability or ailment that effects their mobility. No one should ever assume anything about anyone - and that is why pregnant lady is the Ass. She made an assumption that her needs were greater than everyone elses. Also, who swears at a minor? You are about to become a mother grow up! Lifts come and go regularly.\n\nThat said , Yes OP could of waited for the next one also, but it does not make them an AH because they didn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Spelling of Symptoms & Courtesy - not doing well today :D", "NTA she\u2019s pregnant not a lump of sugar, she shouldn\u2019t melt in the rain.\n\nThen again with her attitude it\u2019s entirely possible that she will melt while going \u201cwhat a world, what a world\u2026\u201d", "NTA if a lift was that full there is a good chance a pregnant woman may not have comfortably fit.\n\nI'm a total fat ass and if presented with a lift mostly full rain or not I'm waiting for a less crampt ride", "NTA given your age. It sounds like you don\u2019t understand how pregnancy can effect someone\u2019s mobility and stability given your comment about your neighbor being able to walk up the stairs, but I don\u2019t think I would have known either at 15 given my lack of exposure to pregnant people at that stage in my life. She should have politely asked you if she could take the elevator if she wanted the last spot, but instead she chastised you in front of your mom. She should have educated you but was rude instead, so I get why you\u2019re annoyed. In the future, you (and everyone able bodied) should offer your spot on public transit to anyone with impaired mobility or a condition that makes it uncomfortable to stand or difficult to balance, which you now know includes pregnant people. \n\nIf you had reason to \u201cknow better,\u201d then YTA.", "NTA to me sounds like she wants special treatment from strangers because she got pregnant", "If she approached the elevator after you had already gotten in then NTA.\n If you walked past her knowing or thinking she was also going to the elevator then YTA. \nIf you actively pushed/rushed past her then you and the others in the elevator are all YTA.", "Not enough info - \n\nHow pregnant? (I know some women who, as soon as they see those 2 pink lines, use it as a reason for them to get their way, and there was nothing medical.

ESH but it\u2019s not the end of the world, just shows that you and the rest of the people elevator weren\u2019t very kind - though mostly you as you were the last one in.", "YTA, but a soft one. Stairs can be pretty tricky while pregnant, your balance is already off and it's easy to trip and hurt yourself and the baby. \nNot letting her in the elevator is equivalent to not letting her have the last seat on a full bus/train. It's just something you should do for people more fragile then yourself. Like pregnant  and elderly people.", "Honestly no. She is pregnant not ill.", "YTA. You give consideration to the disabled, pregnant, and elderly. It's basic decency. \n\nAlso, she might not be able to use the stairs that much.", "Well, rain really wasn't going to hurt the woman. But ask yourself if you would have liked someone to leave your mom standing out in the rain when she was pregnant with you. \n\nYTA mostly for your suggestion that she should have just taken the stairs. You don't know what kind of restrictions she might be on. And stairs when it's been raining can be slippery, therefore dangerous to someone who is pregnant. \n\nI do wonder why you're being singled as as the only A-H though, when there were 9 other people in the elevator who could have given up their spot for her.", "YTA for thinking it's easier for a pregnant lady (assuming heavily pregnant for a teenage boy to notice) can get up one flight of stairs more easily than a teenage boy could get up 5.", "Your Mom thinks YTA. She\u2019s right. \n\nWhat you have a \u201cright\u201d to do & what is right to do are often not the same thing. Sounds like your Mom is trying to raise you to be a good man.", "At 15 I routinely took the stairs to the 6th floor, just because I could and it was faster than the elevator. If you aren't otherwise disabled you could have taken the stairs. \n\nAlso, pregnancy does wild things to your body. It affects your balance and coordination, as your body prepares for childbirth all your tendons and muscles loosen up and you can become very clumsy. So pregnant women should not take the stairs if an elevator is available. \n\nBut also there were 9 other people who could have let her on. And socially you can't fix rudeness by being rude in return. Etiquette dictates you silently think this person is a jerk and move on with your life without offering correction. \n\nESH.", "I dont know about this one, except youre kinda AH for assuming someone pregnant can walk ANY stairs no matter if it just second floor.\nI am 1.5years post birth and i still cant walk any stairs not even the stairs to a bunk bed.\nIt breaks my hips. I will always take the elevator.\nShes also an AH for telling your mom, she couldve told you\u2026 if you are well 6 floors is nothing to walk. Would probably even benefit you.", "YTA. Pregnancy makes mobility difficult. You wouldn\u2019t have been harmed waiting.", "YTA, being considerate of the Eldery, disabled or pregnant is standard etiquette. You will also learn when you are pregnant one day", "INFO: How pregnant was she?\n\nIf she was at 9 months, then there were 10 assholes on that elevator.\n\nIf she was 3 months, totally NTA.", "ESH, yes there were 9 other people who could have got out and waited, but you were the 10th. Calling you out was petty, she needs to get over it. But I don't get everyone saying you couldn't walk up 6 flights of stairs...just wait for the elevator to come back? Also why don't any of you have umbrellas or hoods?", "YTA\n\nSo, the elevator was nearly full but you pushed ahead of a pregnant woman based on your 15 year-old rationalisation that your needs were greater than hers.\n\nYour mother was rightly embarrassed, she probably tried to teach you better manners than that.", "YTA - Why couldn't you run up six sets of stairs so a pregnant woman could use the elevator?", "YTA you could've gone into the stairwell and waited like I see some redditors saying the pregnant lady could do. Difference is you're able bodied and right now she isn't.", "Of course YTA! For pity's sake... Have you all voters been raised by wolves? \n\nI would have given up my spot for pregnant, with child, elderly, overweight, with big fat grocery bags, etc. Anybody who needed to carry something heavy upstairs, including their own limbs. Yes, even if it was \"their choice\" to be like that. And you know why? Because I hope to be reciprocated, when I am in a tight spot. And from my experience, it usually pays off.\n\nDid you have to? No. But don't expect to be also considered nice or be liked.\n\nAnd everybody on the elevator was equally AH. Maybe it was your spot first, but after seeing what was happening, I would have got off even if I had been the first there.", "YTA Y\u2019all hate pregnant people, I swear. It\u2019s just common decency. You\u2019re not obligated to do anything, but you\u2019re morally the AH. Istg my 7yr old nephew has more decency.", "YTA. You could have waited in the stairwell or got the elevator on its way back down. \nShe obviously couldn\u2019t manage the stairs or she would have taken them surely? \n\nIt\u2019s just basic manners, she\u2019s pregnant enough for you to notice and to not use the stairs. Why wouldn\u2019t you just let her go before you (being the last person to enter)", "YTA. Have some common courtesy.... Also all the other people in the elevator are assholes too.", "YTA Your reasoning is that she could have taken the stairs. Not so easy when you're pregnant. She was probably tired and probably had swollen feet which is common for pregnant women. You were rude and inconsiderate to this poor lady. I would have pushed you out of the elevator and let her in. You should have waited for the next time that elevator came around.", "[deleted]", "YTA, because sometimes we just need to be nice to other people. Pregnant woman can\u2019t take stairs. I\u2019m assuming she was pretty pregnant if you could tell she\u2019s pregnant. When I was pregnant I almost lost my child from trying to go up and down stairs daily because of this problem at my job. It caused a problem with the placenta. And I always had the same problem. A ton of young people that would make me wait ten minutes for the elevator when I had to get to work, so I ran up and down stairs and almost lost my child.", "ESH - being drenched is miserable, but another minute isn't much if you're already drenched. The presence of 9 other AHs doesn't make your actions lesser, although I get why it alters your judgement in the moment. \n\nThe other 9 people? Well same reason. The fact the woman was visibly pregnant probably means she's at the later stage when everything is just a lot harder. Hormones can also have huge impact. These are the basic reasons why there are signs on public transport etc. It's not a law, you don't have to, but it's the right thing to do.\n\nPregnant lady is right to be upset, even if it's only 1 floor, she's likely more tired than you or the other 9.
