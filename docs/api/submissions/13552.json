The other swelled up so much she resembled a weeble - had to use litter pickers to put her flip flops on. Pregnancy is also not a free pass to get ahead in lines and special treatment. It is common courtesy yes to offer a seat on a bus/ train to those less able to stand. But there it is - THOSE LESS ABLE. If she didn't know OP, OP could of had a hidden disability or ailment that effects their mobility. No one should ever assume anything about anyone - and that is why pregnant lady is the Ass. She made an assumption that her needs were greater than everyone elses. Also, who swears at a minor? You are about to become a mother grow up! Lifts come and go regularly.\n\nThat said , Yes OP could of waited for the next one also, but it does not make them an AH because they didn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Spelling of Symptoms & Courtesy - not doing well today :D", "NTA she\u2019s pregnant not a lump of sugar, she shouldn\u2019t melt in the rain.\n\nThen again with her attitude it\u2019s entirely possible that she will melt while going \u201cwhat a world, what a world\u2026\u201d", "NTA if a lift was that full there is a good chance a pregnant woman may not have comfortably fit.\n\nI'm a total fat ass and if presented with a lift mostly full rain or not I'm waiting for a less crampt ride", "NTA given your age.

She should have politely asked you if she could take the elevator if she wanted the last spot, but instead she chastised you in front of your mom. She should have educated you but was rude instead, so I get why you\u2019re annoyed. In the future, you (and everyone able bodied) should offer your spot on public transit to anyone with impaired mobility or a condition that makes it uncomfortable to stand or difficult to balance, which you now know includes pregnant people. \n\nIf you had reason to \u201cknow better,\u201d then YTA.", "NTA to me sounds like she wants special treatment from strangers because she got pregnant", "If she approached the elevator after you had already gotten in then NTA.\n If you walked past her knowing or thinking she was also going to the elevator then YTA. \nIf you actively pushed/rushed past her then you and the others in the elevator are all YTA.", "Not enough info - \n\nHow pregnant?

Stairs can be pretty tricky while pregnant, your balance is already off and it's easy to trip and hurt yourself and the baby. \nNot letting her in the elevator is equivalent to not letting her have the last seat on a full bus/train.

You give consideration to the disabled, pregnant, and elderly. It's basic decency. \n\nAlso, she might not be able to use the stairs that much.", "Well, rain really wasn't going to hurt the woman. But ask yourself if you would have liked someone to leave your mom standing out in the rain when she was pregnant with you. \n\nYTA mostly for your suggestion that she should have just taken the stairs. You don't know what kind of restrictions she might be on.

If you aren't otherwise disabled you could have taken the stairs. \n\nAlso, pregnancy does wild things to your body. It affects your balance and coordination, as your body prepares for childbirth all your tendons and muscles loosen up and you can become very clumsy. So pregnant women should not take the stairs if an elevator is available. \n\nBut also there were 9 other people who could have let her on.

Etiquette dictates you silently think this person is a jerk and move on with your life without offering correction. \n\nESH.", "I dont know about this one, except youre kinda AH for assuming someone pregnant can walk ANY stairs no matter if it just second floor.\nI am 1.5years post birth and i still cant walk any stairs not even the stairs to a bunk bed.\nIt breaks my hips. I will always take the elevator.\nShes also an AH for telling your mom, she couldve told you\u2026 if you are well 6 floors is nothing to walk. Would probably even benefit you.", "YTA.

Calling you out was petty, she needs to get over it. But I don't get everyone saying you couldn't walk up 6 flights of stairs...just wait for the elevator to come back? Also why don't any of you have umbrellas or hoods?", "YTA\n\nSo, the elevator was nearly full but you pushed ahead of a pregnant woman based on your 15 year-old rationalisation that your needs were greater than hers.\n\nYour mother was rightly embarrassed, she probably tried to teach you better manners than that.", "YTA - Why couldn't you run up six sets of stairs so a pregnant woman could use the elevator?", "YTA you could've gone into the stairwell and waited like I see some redditors saying the pregnant lady could do. Difference is you're able bodied and right now she isn't.", "Of course YTA! For pity's sake... Have you all voters been raised by wolves? \n\nI would have given up my spot for pregnant, with child, elderly, overweight, with big fat grocery bags, etc. Anybody who needed to carry something heavy upstairs, including their own limbs. Yes, even if it was \"their choice\" to be like that. And you know why? Because I hope to be reciprocated, when I am in a tight spot. And from my experience, it usually pays off.\n\nDid you have to? No. But don't expect to be also considered nice or be liked.\n\nAnd everybody on the elevator was equally AH. Maybe it was your spot first, but after seeing what was happening, I would have got off even if I had been the first there.", "YTA Y\u2019all hate pregnant people, I swear.

Also all the other people in the elevator are assholes too.", "YTA Your reasoning is that she could have taken the stairs. Not so easy when you're pregnant. She was probably tired and probably had swollen feet which is common for pregnant women. You were rude and inconsiderate to this poor lady. I would have pushed you out of the elevator and let her in. You should have waited for the next time that elevator came around.", "[deleted]", "YTA, because sometimes we just need to be nice to other people. Pregnant woman can\u2019t take stairs. I\u2019m assuming she was pretty pregnant if you could tell she\u2019s pregnant. When I was pregnant I almost lost my child from trying to go up and down stairs daily because of this problem at my job. It caused a problem with the placenta. And I always had the same problem. A ton of young people that would make me wait ten minutes for the elevator when I had to get to work, so I ran up and down stairs and almost lost my child.", "ESH - being drenched is miserable, but another minute isn't much if you're already drenched. The presence of 9 other AHs doesn't make your actions lesser, although I get why it alters your judgement in the moment. \n\nThe other 9 people? Well same reason. The fact the woman was visibly pregnant probably means she's at the later stage when everything is just a lot harder. Hormones can also have huge impact. These are the basic reasons why there are signs on public transport etc. It's not a law, you don't have to, but it's the right thing to do.\n\nPregnant lady is right to be upset, even if it's only 1 floor, she's likely more tired than you or the other 9.
