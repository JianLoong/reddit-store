After seeing some replies it seems like your dad sees you as a workhorse who will do whatever he needs without needing extra, like the promise of ownership. You're right in thinking that your loyalty only needs to extend to father. Not your brother in law. Go live your life for you.", "What, you think this is your life to live?  /s  NTA", "NTA. You're giving him as a business owner the real data he needs to do his planning for his, and the company's future.\n\nIts really weird that he would make your sister's husband the boss instead of his own offspring though. What's that about?", "NTA It's not like he's giving it to you. Why would you stick around just to be an employee?", "NTA, you said it best yourself. Your loyalty is to your father not the company, especially if said company is coming under new management (your sister's husband).", "NTA. You need to pursue your own chosen career sometime. Personally I wouldn't wait unless dad's planning to retire very soon.", "NtA but.. don't just reject the legacy either. Talk to dad about how much it would be worth.. what is your ownership percentage and then talk to BIL about buyout.  The work may not go to you but his legacy can still pass down and then you have options but don't make decisions before you have decisions to make. Id want to know more about what it means legally and financially.. this does show you care", "NTA.  And if your brother-in-law is inheriting the company, why are you staying?  To pad his inheritance?  Why not start that ranch now while you're still young enough to do a lot of your own field work?  Doesn't that get harder as you get older?", "Nta at all\n\nLive your best life", "This seems perfectly reasonable and more than fair. NTA.", "NTA I understand where you are coming from. Sounds like you are fine with BIL taking over company because you have plans that do not include family company. Tell dad that staying on after he retires is not in your plans.", "Not at all.", "INFO \u2013 Is there a reason your sister is not under consideration to take over?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You already acknowledged that but the man could still leave you some partial ownership or shares in the business while still leaving BIL in control. Go forward with your plans.", "Not sure. I guess he is a better communicator, a prettier face, and a better socializer, which makes a better owner, whereas I am more hardworking, tougher, harsher, more stubborn, and somewhat more dense, although I\u2019m relatively intelligent when it comes to stuff I know. I\u2019ve always stuck to working in the field with my hands while he can do office work.", "Sexism, would be my guess.", "I sum it up as this, if I had to guess. He\u2019s a prettier face, got better composure and people skills, and is better with money and business/finances. I am more the muscle, although I\u2019m shorter and less physically stronger. I\u2019m more willing to get my hands dirty, have a harder work ethic when it comes to physical labor and working with my hands, have thicker skin, am more stubborn, and am more harsh/brash. One makes a better business owner, and that happens to be him. I\u2019m not upset about it, though.", "Well, I would only ever work for someone whom I feel loyalty towards, and to be loyal to someone I need to be able to trust them, and I trust very few people, my father being one of them, which is why I\u2019ve worked for him for so long.", "She\u2019s an rn, a registered nurse, and she never had any interest in the construction industry.", "Don't sell yourself short. His traits may be better for interfacing with clients or investors. But that doesn't necessarily make him better suited as the owner. They don't make him less suited either per say...\n\nConsider, how much does your BIL know of the field operations? Does he even handle anything of the field work? Or is it and the decisions that impact it all the responsibility others like you or your dad?\n\nPlenty of companies have been run into the ground because a new owner comes in with a great handle on \"office work\", but without any clue about the nuts and bolts of what the company actually does.\n\nYour knowledge of the field work may be more valuable to the company than you might think.\n\nNot saying one way or the other whether you should stick around long term or leave to pursue your other life dreams. Thats ultimately your choice.\n\nJust saying don't put yourself down on what you bring to the table with your skills, knowledge and personal traits and values.", "We\u2019re both men, so not applicable.", "Sounds like you're perfect for that Dream ranch then! Not that I hope your dad passes, but I hope your dream isn't something you put on hold too long in life. Good luck, OP!", "Co-owner would still make sense", "NTA. Your father might be leaving his business to your BIL, but he can't leave *you* to your BIL. It sounds like he views you as an extension of the business, not as his own child who probably should be inheriting the business.", "NTA.  You could be in. Your 79\u2019s until your. Dad gives up the reins.  If he\u2019s it leavi.  The company to you or splitting it, then once you get enough. Money go buy and live. Your dream.

Your loyalty to your father is a rare gift, and he should view it that way.  I wouldn't want to work for one of my brothers-in-law, either.  Blechh!", "NTA if i can retire 1 day earlier i will. Do what you think is right for yourself OP and enjoy.", "Your first para is a very good persuasive statement. Well done.", "NTA- some people are paper-pushers and some are workers. Your loyalty is to yourself, after your father retires/passes, and do what makes you happy.

Your future self will thank your past self for you moving on now.", "It's why companies have things like CEOs and Chief Operating Officers, and even Chief Information Officers and Chief Financial Officers They know that one person might not be great at all things, and you need the best person for the job.", "NTA.  Would the business fold if you left now?  If not, it's not in trouble and you can leave if and when you want.  If yes, then why does BIL get to own it since you are the one holding it together?\n\nEDIT:  Do you know enough about running a ranch or farm to make it successful?  It's a hard life and usually not easy to keep you head above water.", "NTA. But I would suggest talking to your father about leaving the business in your sister\u2019s name, husband can be the boss just without inheriting the company. What will happen if they were to divorce? Where would that leave your family and your sister?"]}
