If he offered it upfront then your fiance has no right to use that as a reason to make you do his chores. Also if he needs help she needs to be the one to get it done.. volunteering you without even asking you first is unacceptable. She can ask for help.. but \"No\" should be an acceptable answer. \n\nYou need to talk to your fiance and let her know this is not ok and she needs to respect you enough to not promise your time and effort to anyone without consulting you first. Family or not.. there has to be respect for all.", "NTA.  Your time is **your** time.\n\nYou clearly need to work on your boundaries with your fiance.  In the future, what else might she \"volunteer\" your time for without your knowledge and consent?  Board membership at your house of worship?  Coach on your children's sports teams?  Organizer at political rallies?  While she is doing this with the best will in the world, the point is that she's doing it *without discussing with you*.  \n\nI hope that you two are participating together in pre-marital counseling.  This is absolutely a topic that should be discussed and resolved during one of your counseling sessions.  How you JOINTLY make decisions as a couple on things like where to live, children, vacations and holidays, and yes, how you spend your free time is a huge part of being a couple.
