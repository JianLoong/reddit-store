If he offered it upfront then your fiance has no right to use that as a reason to make you do his chores. Also if he needs help she needs to be the one to get it done.. volunteering you without even asking you first is unacceptable. She can ask for help.. but \"No\" should be an acceptable answer. \n\nYou need to talk to your fiance and let her know this is not ok and she needs to respect you enough to not promise your time and effort to anyone without consulting you first. Family or not.. there has to be respect for all.", "NTA.  Your time is **your** time.\n\nYou clearly need to work on your boundaries with your fiance.  In the future, what else might she \"volunteer\" your time for without your knowledge and consent?  Board membership at your house of worship?  Coach on your children's sports teams?  Organizer at political rallies?  While she is doing this with the best will in the world, the point is that she's doing it *without discussing with you*.  \n\nI hope that you two are participating together in pre-marital counseling.  This is absolutely a topic that should be discussed and resolved during one of your counseling sessions.  How you JOINTLY make decisions as a couple on things like where to live, children, vacations and holidays, and yes, how you spend your free time is a huge part of being a couple.  Get this squared away now, or your resentment will only skyrocket...and you're not even married yet!", "NTA. She should learn how to do those things. I feel like you're either going to need to find some sort of permanent fix to this: grin and bear it or get him external help, make her do it, move them out of that house. You can say no, but keep in mind that might cause issues.", "NTA. Gift is a gift is a gift, no \u201drepayment\u201d should be expected.", "NTA but even if you guys didn\u2019t ask for it by accepting it you are now obligated to return that in kind. You now learned a lesson in life. So next time, never accept such \u201cgifts\u201d.

We sat down and had a talk this morning, she got very upset (with herself) and said she never realized how much she actually asked me to do. She assured me she will talk to me first before telling her dad I\u2019ll be there to help from here on out. Per usual, communication if key.

See how long it takes her to stop volunteering you to do things.", "I don't care what your cultural background, socioeconomic status, or length of relationship ship is, anyone who volunteers their significant others time to anyone for any reason without prior discussion and consent is a complete and utter AH period.

I don't care if I'm the next Bob Villa, Top Chef, Marie Kondo, or whoever my free time is mine to decide how it's spent. NTA.", "NTA. My dad was always the family's handy man. He already works hard, his job has a lot of physical labor involved. His days off were always spent working on things for his parents, his brother, my mom's parents, her siblings. He never had much time to spend at home with us.\n\nThere was no reason anyone else couldn't have learned how to do the work. They all just found it easier for him to do it because he already does and has experience in different hard labor type jobs. \nHe didn't put his foot down until we were all in high school.\n\nHe is still upset about it, and absolutely refuses to do anything for anyone unless it's for my siblings, myself, or our kids. He's much happier now.\n\nDon't wait years to stand up for yourself.", "The problem here is that she believes she's entitled to command your labor.  Get a lid on that shit.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nTell him you didn\u2019t realize there was money owed for offering to pay for the wedding. If she wants to help her dad, tell her to hire someone out of her own pocket. He wants her to tell you to fix it for him, that\u2019s why he does it. \n\nThis is your future, pay attention.", "NTA. If your fiance feels the need to provide those kind of services to her father, let her do it, or pay for a handyman to do it. It's not up to you. Stick to your guns on this one.", "NTA", "Nta. Sounds like Dad may be lonely. He needs to find an interest/hobby.", "NTA, but you need to understand clearly that this is your life now.

No one should be volunteering you for anything at any time for any reason.", "Nta.", "She never offers to do the repairs herself, so it isn't about repaying his wedding contributions. Call him directly and let him know that you can give him a specific amount of hours during a single day, one weekend a month. You and the other boyfriends can go there once a month and knock out the Honey Do list. Anything else can go through his home warranty. He needs to stop going through his daughter.

You'll end up voluntold to help her dad, her siblings, her friends...", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your fianc\u00e9e's father is bored and lonely. Maybe preempt his next complaining session by asking him to come help you with *your* home maintenance tasks.

This will be your life for the foreseeable future. It will only get more demanding as time goes on. I suggest some premarital counseling.", "Perfect response. Also 60ish, retired, and has funds for a wedding? Definitely has the ability to pay for a handyman.", "I agree. A marriage is not slavery. You need to communicate to eachother for it to work. Any commitments should be discussed with the other person before making any promises to others.", "I don\u2019t mind helping him with things he\u2019s not capable of doing, but organizing his shed is not something he\u2019s not capable of doing on his own lol", ">Do you think he's lonely, and that's why he has so many chores that need doing every week? You and his daughter should go together and help him out\n\n\nHis daughter and her family should help him. Op works 4am-4pm and needs his time. Also, it is very wrong to volunteer people's time. Very wrong and irritating behaviour", "Not lonely. What I think is he spent the last 40 years point fingers for people to do things at work and now there\u2019s nobody left to point fingers for so it falls on his kids/their significant others"]}
