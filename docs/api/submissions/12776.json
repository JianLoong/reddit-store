{"id": 12776, "submission_id": "11ww7zt", "title": "AITA for cutting my niece\u2019s hair?", "selftext": "My 5 year old niece had very long, beautiful hair. She only ever had a trim *once* since being born, prior to me cutting it. I would say that my sister is weirdly attached to the idea of my niece having long hair - and everyone seems to make a big fuss about how pretty it is, like strangers would even point it out and compliment her. I honestly find it a little creepy. \n\nAnyway, last weekend my sister asked me to babysit while her and my BIL had a date night. \n\nI spend lots of time with my niece and I have noticed on several occasions that she will get super frustrated with her hair. Like she'll be trying to play or run around and it'll get in the way and she just gets really upset. She will sometimes see someone on tv with shorter hair and then express that she \"likes that hairstyle\". I've asked my sister more than once if she ever would consider having my niece's hair cut shorter since she's shown interest in it, and my sister immediately shuts it down. Her excuse is always that my niece is too young to make big decisions about her hair, and that she would probably get upset and eventually miss her long hair.\n\nNow going back to last weekend. I took my niece out to do a few activities and once again noticed she was getting frustrated with her hair. She asked me to help her tie it up to keep it from getting in the way. Later on at my apartment, I put on YouTube Kids for her. The girl in the video she was watching had shoulder length hair and my niece expressed that she liked it.\n\nI've been cutting my own hair for a few years now and I've gotten pretty decent at it. I asked my niece if she wanted me to give her a haircut and she agreed without hesitation. I ended up cutting quite a bit, just past her shoulders with layers. It looked super cute and she really liked it. I also saved the long locks that I cut off just because I was preparing for my sister's wrath and since she's been so obsessed with my niece's hair, I thought she might want to keep it. \n\nMy sister was *pissed* when she came to pick up my niece. She was so angry and upset that she actually started to cry. I tried to be rational with her and pretty much just explained that my niece liked it and that more importantly, it was more *comfortable* for her now. \n\nMy sister called me an asshole and said that I was a terrible person for cutting my niece's hair with getting her permission. My parent's are mostly on my sister's side in that they think I at least should have asked first. In my defense, I know she would've said no, and I've been feeling bad for my niece because her hair was always getting in the way. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679347007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ww7zt/aita_for_cutting_my_nieces_hair/", "score": 1863, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wow. In terms of assholery, this is leveling up.\n\nOf course YTA. You stepped into decision making territory that you had no right to. None.\n\nI hope your parenting boundaries are someday as disrespected as your sister's are by you today. Man...the audacity.", "YTA. \n\nYou didn't even bother to take her in to get it done. You just hacked away and hoped for the best. And expected your sister to what? Thank you? Your role on this day was babysitter. Babysitters do not cut their charge's hair unless there is a problem like a toy stuck in it and even then, they contact the parents and ask permission. \n\nIf her hair was getting in the way then put it in a braid. You are not the parent. You do not make decisions to alter the child's appearance without parental permission. \n\nI doubt you will ever be allowed to be alone with your niece again.", "Oh wow YTA. I am a mom who lets my 4 year old pick a haircut, but that\u2019s MY choice as a mother. You are neither parent to this child, what you did was way over the line. You can braid long hair to get it out of the way. You can put it in a bun. You can put it in pigtails. You can put it in a ponytail. You can put it up with a clip. You don\u2019t cut someone else\u2019s kids hair.", "<<In my defense, I know she would've said no>>\n\nThis isn't a defense, it's a confession.\n\nWho do you think you are, exactly?\n\nI know: YTA.", "You are not her parent.

Young children will agree to anything if you talk it up enough.  I'm sure that any five year old would happily let you shave them bald until they went to school the next day and got laughed at.  A thirteen year old asking for a hair cut is one thing.  Gaslighting a five year old into asking for one is quite another.", "YTA - in my state your sister could press charges on you for this\u2026 I\u2019m not saying that would be right but I want you to understand.\n\nThat was not ok. That is not your child!", "Holy shit YTA! A five yo makes those kind of decisions with their parents!", "The only people who should be making decisions about a 5 year old\u2019s hair are: the child and her parents. \n\nYou are not on that list. YTA. \n\nYes, the child should have a say in her own hair.  But you have no say in this, you shouldn\u2019t have asked her behind her parents back. \n\nYou are trying to make it sound like you acted in your niece\u2019s best interest. But it sounds a lot more like you judged your sister to be a bad parent, and did what you wanted because you think you are right.", "YTA, i understand that you wanna be nice to the kid, but it's not your kid. You know the mom is not gonna be happy about it and you still did it, like to annoy her and play the \"sorry i didin't know\" card.", "YTA\n\nYou overstepped and should have talked to your sister beforehand. \n\nYou made a parenting decision and you aren\u2019t the parent.", "YTA. You knew that HER MOTHER didn't want the child's hair cut and you did it anyway. You'll be lucky if you see her unsupervised again.  \nA similar thing happened in my family. A cousin of my mother's was staying with her family when my mother and aunt were small children. This cousin needed a place to stay, but repeatedly said that my aunt would look better with shorter hair, etc. I believe my aunt was 4-5 at this time. One day when my grandmother was out, cousin cut my aunt's hair. She was out on her ass before the day was out.", "Yta. You should have asked", "YTA - absolutely never ever ever cut a child\u2019s hair without the parents\u2019 approval. Don\u2019t do ANYTHING to a kid without the parents\u2019 ok.

And you knew that which is why you did it behind her back", "ESH. Your sister sucks for putting her desires above her daughter\u2019s comfort, but unfortunately it was not your place to cut her hair.", "YTA this is not your child, you don't just randomly cut someone else's kid's hair.  Especially when you've already spoken to your sister about it and she said no.  What part of no didn't you understand?

How can you have done this? It is not your job to decide about niece's hair. And that you are playing the innocent is disgusting.", "I'm gonna go with ESH.\n\nYou definitely should not cut her hair without parental consent. That being said, mothers treating their daughters like dolls rubs me the wrong way too. Children are absolutely capable of making decisions about their hair and they're human beings who should get to make basic decisions about their bodies.  I sympathize with your POV for sure, but think you're the bigger AH.", "YTA. This is for her parents to decide. You have every right to bring up the fact that niece is interested in shorter hair, how it would be easier for her, etc, but this is not your kid and a 5 year old cannot give you permission. This could be considered assault. (I don\u2019t consider it that but it could be as you physically altered part of her person without permission). \n\nAlso, whether or not your sister planned to cut her hair soon, it\u2019s a right of passage to witness the first haircut and at the very least have a say in it as a parent. \n\nIf you babysat or nannied for money and your charge asked you to cut her hair would you? If a child at your niece\u2019s birthday asked you to cut her hair would you? My guess is no because you know it\u2019s wrong but you thought since she\u2019s *family* that it would be ask forgiveness later type thing.", "Absolutely YTA.", "YTA.  Have you not heard of a pony tail and/or braid?  I hope you realize that your sister can charge you with assault.", "YTA\nYou don't cut children's hair without permission, and at that age, the permission needs to be the parents'. Congratulations, you have probably deprived your niece of her favourite aunt, since your sister will never trust you again.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been repeatedly told NO when you\u2019ve asked about cutting her hair. She\u2019s never before had a haircut. That is something many parents want to witness. You would not be alone with my child anymore.", "YTA. you're acting like the long hair is a detriment to the niece's life, when in reality it's just a nuisance. you could've braided it, put it up in a bun, do a \"princess leia\" hairstyle, etc. but you decided to go against your sister's wishes, and within a few short hours, you did something you *knew* was unwanted.\n\nand what's stopping you from doing this again in the future? that you think you \"know more\" than her parents? that you believe something is \"not that big of a deal\" and then just do it? if you cant be trusted not to mess with hair, then how can you be trusted with medicine, food, clothes, etc? \n\nyou didnt even *try* to find a compromise, and that's a big problem YTA", "YTA not your kid not your decision.", "YTA\n\nYou went against you sisters expressed opinion. Your niece is 5 years old, she's not supposed to make this decision on her own.\n\nI completely understand you point of view, long hair can sometimes be more important to the mother than the child, but it's still the mum's call. The only thing you can do in this situation is try to make her see that.\n\nYou knew very well the mum didn't want to cut her daughter's hair, and wasn't even willing to discuss it and you did it anyway. If it were my child- I would feel completely violated and would not trust you around her in the future. Someone here wrote this could be considered assault, and I agree.\n\nIf you want to save your relationship with you sister and your niece I think you should apologise profoundly and promise to never do such a thing ever again.", "You could have got creative with braids or hair clips instead of scissors. \n\nI would\u2019ve gone mental if any one cut my kids hair without my permission.

Not your kid, not your decision. You even knew your sister would be angry about it and that you were doing something wrong.

It's her mother's decision and you know it. Do you have some resentment against your sister you're not telling us about? You were asked to babysit, not be a hairdresser. What did your sister do to hurt you?", "YTA. You\u2019re coming off as jealous of people making a fuss over it, then you say it\u2019s creepy but if someone did this to me and my kid it would creep me out to have 1)my wishes thrown out the window 2)my own sibling go behind my back with my kids hair 3) special moment to have with my own kid taken. Short hair gets in the way too btw unless it\u2019s like a pixie cut.

No no. You do not make such decisions about someone else's child. You also aren't a hairdresser. \n\nYou can't be a real person. This is just so oblivious.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t the parent, you didn\u2019t get parental permission, and you could have simply helped her style her hair in a way that keeps it from getting in the way. Her hair with layers will probably be more difficult to do now as well (and they may have to go to a professional to fix auntie\u2019s work.).

Your sister is nuts being so invested in her kids hair but you had no right to make the decision for her.", "YTA for cutting your nieces hair without parental permission. In fact, you knew your sister would say no, so you asked a five year old for permission.You may have lost unsupervised visits with your niece. Personally, I'd would look in to pressing charges against you.", "YTA you don\u2019t cut the hair of other people\u2019s children unless asked. No matter you relationship to her.", "YTA. Never ever do anything like that without the parent's consent. She's five. Yes, she might want xyz, but you have zero right to do it without the parent's consent. And you knew she wouldn't like it. You KNEW it.", "YTA.", "Ohhh YTA. I get it. My daughter had long hair down to the small of her back and she wanted it cut.

But soft YTA and be prepared for her to not trust you to babysit anymore. I have a friend who's half turkish with thick, beautiful hair. When her daughter was born, she took after her mom. She is only 2 and her hair is already past her shoulders but is blonde like her dad's. People's comments are super creepy! You can't believe the amount of attention she gets and my friend really doesn't like it. OPs sister is obviously living vicariously or enjoys the attention her daughter gets. BUT it's not practical for *her daughter.*\n\nWhile OP is the AH for cutting it knowing her sister would be against it, I think there are bigger probs that need to be addressed", "ESH. You should have gotten permission before cutting your nieces hair.\n\n\nBut her parents are assholes here as well, from the age 4 or 5 kids do have their preferences and figuring out their way in this world and if the long hair is bothering your niece in activities they should have compromised or have __listened__ to their kid.\n\n\nFuck. I hate it so much that parents do not listen to their kids because they are the parent and their word is law.. ugh. My youngest is a boy (5) and he has shoulder length hair!! He loves his hair, I'm not gonna be the one telling him we have to shave it off because he is a boy or whatever people think. No! He loves his hair long and the only rule we have about this is that he has to brush his hair daily (ideally twice a day, but hey he is 5)\n\n\nSame goes for my oldest, long hair bothers her, so she keeps it shoulder length. Would I love to see her with long hair, yes! Is it my choice? No, not my body, not my decision.", "YTA\n\nThere is no way you can't understand this.  \n\nAnd you understand that you will never get to spend one on one time with your Niece again right?  Never.  Justifiably.\n\nGod YTA.", "YTA. It's understandable that you wanted to make your niece more comfortable, but you should have discussed it with your sister first. Your niece may have been frustrated with her hair, but ultimately, it's your sister's decision as to how her daughter's hair should be styled. Your niece is still young and doesn't understand the implications of cutting her hair, so you should have respected your sister's wishes. It's nice that you saved the cut hair, but that doesn't change the fact that you overstepped boundaries.", "YTA but only because you created a core memory without mom, I would have punched you in the face as my sister but more so because your niece will forever remember her first \u201cofficial\u201d haircut", "You the asshole. Never, ever do something to or for a child unless it is your child. You knew it was wrong but did it anyway so you the asshole X 2.", "ESH but actually what you did was so much worse I\u2019m tempted to say Y T A. \n\nYour sister is probably projecting too much on to your niece\u2019s hair and it\u2019s indicative of future unhealthy patterns of control.\n\nBut it\u2019s not your place to cut your niece\u2019s hair either. There were alternatives for her comfort and ease, such as tying it up, and opportunities for you to intervene with your sister and talk to her further about your niece\u2019s hair, or even to speak to your niece\u2019s other parent. Not to cut her hair without consent of her parents, and you\u2019re not even a professional. \n\nAnd, by the way, your sister in law is quite right that a five year old has no conception of the relative permanence of a hair cut. Your niece expressing that she liked a shorter haircut on a TV character was no guarantee that she wouldn\u2019t have a complete meltdown after her own haircut.

She's not your child, and you had no right to make that decision. \n\nYour sister is absolutely wrong to disregard your niece's feelings about her hair. If her hair is consistently getting in the way and causing frustration, that needs to be addressed. Also, strangers touching her hair is creepy. Your sister is setting her daughter up to have issues about her hair. \n\nThe only person who doesn't suck is your niece.

I agree with your position on the hair theoretically, but you should be looking at your relationship with your niece as an ongoing one, subject to the control of her parents. Not a one-off issue about a single visit. Maybe this was a win. Maybe your niece is vastly happier and will be until her hair grows out again. But what is certain is that no matter what your niece feels about her hair, you\u2019ve just made your ability to be an ally, advocate, and friend to your niece that much harder by eroding trust with your sister. Your sister is the parent and you are not. You do not get to decide what is best for your niece, no matter how hard that may be.", "ESH\n\nYour sister sucks for not listening to her daughter and being more attached to the idea of long hair than her daughter\u2019s comfort.\n\nBut if anyone made any kind of body altering decision (including hair cutting) on any of my kids without my consent they would be lucky to ever see my kid again and it would be a cold day in hell before they ever had them unsupervised.", "YTA, not your kid.

Now the five year old is going to absorb the feelings and possibly think she\u2019s responsible for upsetting her mother.", "YTA, you might think you did something nice but you didn't. You knew your sister would be upset, and you did it anyway.\nI'm confused as to why you don't just tie her hair up earlier if it annoys her while she is playing around you, lots of people have long hair and it's not an issue.\n\nAlso if you were going to be sneaky and cut it, atleast take her to a proper hair salon.", "YTA. No question. Not even room for discussion. Not your child. Not your decision. Major stepping over boundaries. You need to apologize to your sister, your niece, your parents, and humanity at large. Something is seriously wrong with you. Please do not reproduce. Really. You're broken.", "ESH. I completely understand why you cut without your sister\u2019s permission; she was never going to give it, and I think what a lot of people are forgetting when they say that braids and such are an option are that even the best braid/ponytail in the world can\u2019t stop that much hair from being HEAVY. When it\u2019s all pulling from one location, it can hurt, and your niece is probably much more comfortable without that amount of hair. But you should have asked permission.", "YTA. You knew your sister didn't want it cut. You totally ignored her mom, and deliberate went behind her back.  All you gad to do was put it in a ponytail or braid if it was in her eyes. Your sister will never trust you again if she ever speaks to you in the next 10 years.", "YTA, your sister is allowed to make rules for her kids. You could have just braided her hair.", "ESH. I agree it sucks for your niece to be frustrated with her hair but that was still a parenting decision of your sisters.  Even if it is the wrong choice it was still her choice unfortunately.", "I mean I guess *technically* you would be TA for cutting the hair without parental permission- thats a big boundary to overstep. However, your sister sounds like a huge AH who treats her kid as a baby doll, and I'm sure you just made your niece so so happy. So guess you're an AH for the action, but you did right by the kiddo. So I guess take from that what you will.", "ETA- you are NTA the whole getting over attached to kids hair sickens me. Honestly I would have just given the kid access to scissors and trimmed my hair at the same time (totally watching and supervising!) then handed the kiddo back with an OMG I am so sorry we were doing crafts and she totally just hacked at her hair!?! Leave the kid with a raggedy hair cut that mom will need to get sorted (offer to neaten it up of course)", "I'm sorry that your relationship with your niece is over.

She will sometimes see someone on tv with shorter hair and then express that she \"likes that hairstyle\". I've asked my sister more than once if she ever would consider having my niece's hair cut shorter since she's shown interest in it, and my sister immediately shuts it down. Her excuse is always that my niece is too young to make big decisions about her hair, and that she would probably get upset and eventually miss her long hair.\n\nNow going back to last weekend. I took my niece out to do a few activities and once again noticed she was getting frustrated with her hair. She asked me to help her tie it up to keep it from getting in the way. Later on at my apartment, I put on YouTube Kids for her. The girl in the video she was watching had shoulder length hair and my niece expressed that she liked it.\n\nI've been cutting my own hair for a few years now and I've gotten pretty decent at it. I asked my niece if she wanted me to give her a haircut and she agreed without hesitation. I ended up cutting quite a bit, just past her shoulders with layers. It looked super cute and she really liked it. I also saved the long locks that I cut off just because I was preparing for my sister's wrath and since she's been so obsessed with my niece's hair, I thought she might want to keep it. \n\nMy sister was *pissed* when she came to pick up my niece. She was so angry and upset that she actually started to cry. I tried to be rational with her and pretty much just explained that my niece liked it and that more importantly, it was more *comfortable* for her now. \n\nMy sister called me an asshole and said that I was a terrible person for cutting my niece's hair with getting her permission. My parent's are mostly on my sister's side in that they think I at least should have asked first. In my defense, I know she would've said no, and I've been feeling bad for my niece because her hair was always getting in the way. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think it was a matter of time before this exploded into something else bc this girl could've gotten a pair of scissors and said you know what my mom is an idiot \\*chop\\*", "There's plenty of ways to deal with long hair. Plaiting it would have been enough. Teaching your niece to do it would have been fun, there's so many ways to braid hair. Instead you chose to chop her hair knowing fully that her mother would have told you not to. \n\nYes, you're TA.", "YTA.   Even if you were in the right, this is your niece, not your daughter.   You don't get to make those decisions.  Not getting parental permission before cutting her hair?  And going against something you knew your sister wouldn't want?  Yeah, that's asshole behavior.  I wonder if you'll spend as much time with your niece, now that her mom knows she can't trust you to keep to her wishes?", "Honestly? NTA. Parents like this are insufferable, coming from a teen. When a parent decides that your hair is just for them to model what they want, and don\u2019t let you have any say about your hair from a young age, it doesn\u2019t stop, and its so demeaning and degrading. I liked my long hair, i never expressed interest in cutting it so my mum cut it as a punishment. She gave me a heavy fringe because she thought it\u2019d suit me better and it heavily impacted my mental health & i hated it, and expressed how i never wanted it in the first place. Yeah you\u2019re not the kids parent, but you sure as hell did them a favour", "YTA not only did you undermine your sister as a parent you also took away an important moment for most parents, taking their kid for their first haircut. Just because you disagree with your sister doesn\u2019t mean you get to go behind her back and do something to her child you knew would be incredibly upsetting. As a mom I\u2019d be devastated and my daughter has shoulder length hair!", "ESH except the kid", "YTA. If my sisters did that, I would never leave my children alone with them again.", "YTA. What is wrong with you?", "\"In my defense, I know she would've said no\"  That's not a defense.", "ESH she's not your child to make thw decision to cut her hair. It's often a really big deal for the parent for their child to get their haircut.  It's part of their kid growing up. \n\nHowever your sister also kinda sucks for not listening to her daughter's wishes to have shorter and more manageable hair.  At 5 she should have plenty of time to grow it out again is she wants.", "YTA - this was not your child this was not your decision how dare you do something so extreme without her permission you can never take back what you did, it was not rational it was not reasonable you destroyed something without any thought but you wanted your sister to be rational about it!? Wow you are incredible. I have super long hair myself and I can put it in a bun or a pony tail to get it out of the way, your niece asked for your help to do just that, why didn\u2019t you assist in placing the hair in a tight bun or ponytail so it was temporarily out of the way?", "You didn't cut the hair of a consenting teenager, but of a five year old girl, without any parental consent.\n\nShe didn't even ask for it: you asked HER:  *I asked my niece if she wanted me to give her a haircut and she agreed without hesitation.*\n\nIf she was uncomfortable, you could have just tied the hair together.\n\nYTA and a very entitled one.", "1. Obviously you don\u2019t have kids \n2. Obviously you shouldn\u2019t have kids\n\nYTA.", "Wtf you asked the child if you can cut her hair without her parent\u2019s permission? \ud83d\ude02", "YTA.  Way out of bounds.  You knew better because you didn't bother to call your sister or try to put your niece's hair up in braids or a ponytail.  You did a really jerky thing. I doubt if your sister will get past this very soon.", "ESH, but this one\u2019s more complicated than most.\n\nYour sister is definitely an asshole. She\u2019s allowed to love her daughter\u2019s long hair, but she shouldn\u2019t be prioritizing her preference over your niece\u2019s stated frustration with it; nor over her stated desire to have a shorter hairstyle. By the time a child is capable of expressing a desire to have agency over their own body, they should be able to manifest it within reason. Her mom should be able to tell her she can\u2019t go to first grade rocking purple liberty spikes for example; piercings and tattoos would fit into that category as well. But we\u2019re not talking about anything as \u201cextreme\u201d as any of that, we\u2019re talking about a child who cries because her hair prevents her from being a playful child. We\u2019re talking about a child who sees short hairstyles and wants them. She has a right to have a shorter hairstyle if she wants too, and your sister\u2019s vicarious vanity shouldn\u2019t be the determining factor. **But\u2026**\n\nUnilateral action was not the move. Your sister was in the wrong, but that didn\u2019t give you the right to intervene. You are not the arbiter of justice in the lives of other people\u2019s children, even in the case of somebody you love as much as you obviously love your niece. You\u2019re not as big of an asshole as your sister, because I believe your motivations were genuine and positive. Still, in the end you did the wrong thing for the right reasons, and it\u2019s a slippery slope. Your sister shouldn\u2019t have been usurping your niece\u2019s bodily autonomy; likewise you should not have usurped your sister\u2019s parental agency. Outside of matters of health and safety, we can\u2019t make decisions on behalf of children\u2019s parents. In a society wherein that\u2019s ok, we open the door to all nature of meddlesome adults to interfere in the lives of other people\u2019s children in ways we can\u2019t begin to predict. Unfortunately, within legally defined limits (which I concede are imperfect), we have to allow parents to be wrong. Parenting is an inexact practice without universal rights and wrongs, and if all parents\u2019 choices are subject to subversion by other concerned adults, then the concept of parental authority becomes obsolete.", "ESH. You knew your sister would have said no. And you did it anyway. That makes you an asshole.\n\nYour sister is an asshole because a child is \"old enough\" to make decisions about their hair when they're old enough to express a preference. As for \"eventually regretting it\" guess what? There hair will eventually grow back too!", "YTA. If her hair was getting in the way, you could have braided it or put it into a ponytail. Cutting it was serving your own interests with total disregard to your sister\u2019s wishes. You violated her trust, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she doesn\u2019t let you watch your niece anymore.", "Lmao she thought cutting it would be a good option and then said \"she's so obsessed with my nieces hair I thought she might like to keep it\", did it not occur to you thought your thick skull that she wanted it kept on her daughter's head not in locks or a wrath. YTA and I wouldn't want my children anywhere near people like you. Mind your own business in future", "YTA. \n\nDon\u2019t do something with someone\u2019s child without the parents consent. Insanely easy concept to grasp. \n\nI\u2019d be pissed too.", "OMG, I said the exact same thing, above. Didn't mean to steal your line. :)", "OP is one of those \u201cask for forgiveness not permission\u201d people\u2014in other words an asshole", "Right? It doesn't get more cut and dried than \"I did this thing even though I knew I shouldn't.\"", "Exactly OP YTA. I hate that i have to give my mother strict instructions not to cut my kids hair but at least she has the decency to listen!", "Did you feel the same way about the babysitter that didn't ask before changing out the inappropriate footwear that one parent kept sending her in?", "Exactly.\n\nAlso, the niece NEVER asked for it, OP asked her:\n\n *I asked my niece if she wanted me to give her a haircut and she agreed without hesitation.*\n\nHow is a five year old going to refuse an adult? How's that for consent?\n\nYTA and a very entitled one.", "People tend to object to what amounts to assault so best not to ask.  OP could probably be charged in some jurisdictions.  YTA.", "Right?! As a fellow mom, the further I read, the more convinced I was that OP was TA. No one gets to make that first haircut decision, except mom and (maybe) dad. My daughter was 4 when I cut hers for the first time, and she looked so grown up after - I would have been devastated if someone had taken that moment/decision from us!", "Right like I don\u2019t understand why the niece\u2019s hair is constantly in the way? Is no one doing her hair?? I never had haircuts growing up - just minor trims - and I always had my hair back to keep it out of the way. It got down to nearly my knees and I somehow managed to keep it out of the way.", "But the child was happy with the haircut, I don't see what the actual problem is beyond a parent upset that they weren't given authoritarian control about a trivial choice on a matter of vanity.", "Those things are all physically painful after a certain amount of time. You want the child to be in physical pain because her mother is a selfish asshole? Hmmmmm", "But it\u2019s just a haircut and it grows back, why is it so bad?  Trying to understand.", "Man, I keep trying to tell my MIL this, but she just doesn't get it. She grew up in a culture where that wasn't really a thing so it's so hard to get it across.", "According to this article it could be considered assault or abuse\n\nhttps://beingagoodparent.com/cutting-a-childs-hair-without-permission/\n\nEdit: article not arrivals.  Words are hard.", "What charges could you press for this", "and what a missed opportunity to talk to the niece about consent, personal space. Not just cut the hair all rogue.", "I wish I had an award to give it to you!", "It wasn\u2019t to annoy her. I was trying to help my niece and alleviate her discomfort from having super long hair.", "Oh OP said they had brought it up to the kid's mom multiple times and been shot down. They just think they know better than mom and disapprove.\n\nYTA OP", "She asked the kid, you know the one with the hair. It seems like she really wanted her hair cut, her mother was just imposing her ideals in her daughter.At 5 years old you know if you want your hair shorter or longer, and the obsession of the mother with the hair is kinda weird, it is as if she thought her daughter is a doll with no ability to make decisions around her own body. Again, it is a haircut, not a pircing and it is not like she saved tge girl's hair. NTA, Op", "I have brought it up in the past but my sister was never willing to even consider it. My niece has been on the verge of tears more than once just from being frustrated with her hair - it was awful.", "Yeah, I feel the same. ESH. OP knew how this was gonna end up. But also, my friend\u2019s kid is around the niece\u2019s age, has fairly short hair\u2014 & still gets frustrated with it while trying to play. Can\u2019t imagine trying to wash a 5 year old\u2019s super long hair is fun, either.\n\nI will never understand parents who refuse to let their kids have even such a big (for the kid) but small (in literally every other way) preference for themselves. It\u2019s just *hair*. Heaven forbid their kid decide to like the wrong colors or end up being left-handed or gay or something else that doesn\u2019t fit into their parents\u2019 perfect little plan. Five is definitely old enough to make basic choices about her own haircut\u2026 like, so what if their parents love their long hair?

We cannot say whether or not the child truly even wanted their hair cut, or even whether or not is is true that OP\u2019s niece always compliments short hairstyles.

Yes she\u2019s five, but having a haircut isn\u2019t going to harm her in any way... she definitely shouldn\u2019t have gone behind her sister\u2019s back but I feel like you\u2019re being a little harsh on OP. It\u2019s a haircut, it\u2019s what the kid wanted, she loves it (the opinion that matters the most here)\u2026 kids have so little say in anything growing up, let them get a haircut or grow their hair out if they want. It IS weird for adults to get so pressed about it, and I\u2019m tired of pretending it\u2019s not.

A 5 year old is perfectly capable of deciding they do not like having long hair, and contrary to the sisters opinion this is not a \"big decision\".  Hair grows back.

You learned a lesson about the natural consequences of impulsive decision making, and hair grows back; OP\u2019s niece got the kind of hair she wants. Maybe your mom should\u2019ve given some pushback, or given you some time to make sure you actually wanted it, but even so, hair grows back. Lessons aren\u2019t always pleasant, but you weren\u2019t harmed by temporarily having short hair.", "So true! She probably would have agreed to someone in her class doing it with construction paper scissors", "Right?!  lol", "At 5, I thought it was a good idea to cut my own hair. At Thanksgiving dinner, I got up, went to the bathroom, and butchered off my bangs.", "Five year olds think it's a good idea to cut *their own* hair!", "At five, I cut one of my pigtails off\u2026 because I could\u2026 one side just chopped off of curly hair. Because I wanted to try short hair and then expected it would grow back (overnight)\u2026", "Exactly!  My brother and I both thought it would be a good idea for me to trim his bangs when we were kids. I can safely tell you that it was not a good idea (no one was hurt, just had some stupid hair for a bit).  Also, niece may not even understand that the hair cut is a permanent thing and could turn some tomorrow and want get long hair back.", "Because OP wanted to despite her sister having said no.", "I don\u2019t see a difference. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s place to make that call. If that happened she should have talked to her sister about it and tried to persuade her, not take matters into her own hands.", "I noticed that too", "Yeah, that was my elementary school.  You don't touch kids' hair period, OP.  Good luck getting 1 on 1 time with your niece again anytime soon.", "That's heartbreaking. :(", "to say nothing of turbans", "As someone who chopped off that long hair to then have chin length hair for years - so incredibly true!! You cannot put it in a ponytail or anything. Best you can do is put half up. She\u2019s gonna be complaining about hair in face and blowing in the wind and not being able to pull it back! Growing out my hair right now to just try out different lengths and the joy of putting my hair in a ponytail after 5yrs is fantastic.", "Exactly. I am probably too old for my long hair, but I don\u2019t cut it because I can\u2019t stand it touching my face, getting in my line of vision, etc. It either has to be short or able to be pulled back. Poor kid. She\u2019s probably worse off now than she was with it long", "Exactly. Layers . Those front layers that fall out of the pony tail.", "Oh my gosh you\u2019re so right they do kinda sound jealous. I was thinking the \u201cit\u2019s so creepy people compliment her hair\u201d was so off, but you\u2019re right it reads jealous. And the \u201ceveryone makes such a big fuss about it\u201d. She\u2019s 5!! They\u2019re probably just being all nice to a young kid.", "While OP is the AH for cutting the hair out of an adult perspective, I think the parents are at fault too. If the niece is so annoyed by her long hair and has repeatedly expressed interest in shorter hairstyles, the parents should have taken her to get a haircut. My parents always let us choose our haircuts. And not giving that choice to a child is in AH territory as well for me.", "Because when it comes to daughter's, most fathers leave the decisions about hair to the mother. Just like most mothers leave decisions about their son's hair to the father.", "That was the biggest problem my mom had with my hair. My hair is thick, coarse, and wavy; hers is fine and pin straight. Brushing used to be a nightmare because she would use tools meant for her hair type (boar bristle brushes, fine tooth combs, tiny hair ties) on mine. My hair became a whole lot more manageable once my future SIL (who has extremely tight curls) taught me about fine tooth combs, wet brushes, and leave in conditioner.", "Absolutely! I was that kid, and it was an effing nightmare. On top of all the bodily autonomy/comfort in one\u2019s own skin issues. Incindentally, I\u2019ve had a pixie for years, and never plan on returning.", "Hence the ESH", "I understand skepticism when a story doesn't fully add up, but people just arbitrarily choosing to disbelieve facts to the point where it's a completely different story always gets me.", "Haha because it\u2019s Reddit? (But I\u2019m not actually arguing with you, I fully agree!)", "I think she is telling the truth as she sees it. But she isn't the parent so doesn't have the full picture, and since she seems so fixated on cutting her neices hair she could well be remembering the times the girl was annoyed and not sharing or remembering any times when she liked her hair.\n\nYes all we have to go on is what is shared in the post, but in this case between the scant details and weird OP, I don't think there is enough to call the mother an asshole.", "Isn\u2019t forcing someone to have excessively long hard to maintain hair also abusive?", ">there are no examples of it being a problem other than \"it gets in the way while playing\".\n\nHaving excessively long hair can cause headaches and neck problems. Putting the hair into a style such as a bun or braid can add on to the weight and put stress onto your neck and head. For a child, it can be a detriment to their health.\n\nBut OP didn't mention any of this as far as I know. She was probably fine for the moment, but still. It *can* be a health hazard.", "It doesn't have to be harmful to be a detriment. It absolutely is a constant annoyance. It'll keep getting in the way when you do things. It's uncomfortable while eating or sleeping. Tying it up can help solve some problems but tying it up can also be very uncomfortable. Why would you want to be in constant uncomfort if you get nothing out of it? The only reason I kept my long hair for so long is because I absolutely loved how it looked. If I didn't love the looks I wouldn't think twice about cutting it. Life is much more comfortable without long hair.", "I have fine hair but a lot of it so if you looked at it the wrong way, rat's nest. Put it in a braid, yeah that won't stay. Doing my hair required time and tons of uncomfortable product, neither of which my mom had. If I washed it too much, it was all static and frizz, if I didn't wash it enough, it was weighed down with oil. It was such an uncomfortable experience and to this day I have a terrible relationship with my hair. I feel like I'm doing something wrong if I cut off a lot. I'm not a good advocate for myself at the salon, I apologize to the stylist, I apologize to the person washing my hair, I apologize to my boyfriend when I get home from a haircut. All because my mom was obsessed with long hair because her mom wouldn't let her keep long hair. She grew up feeling like she looked like a boy, and felt no man would love her with short hair as an adult.", "This should be top comment. \n\nThis addresses why any body would even consider going behind a parent's back.", "Stepmother wouldn\u2019t let me cut my hair as a teenager. I had super thick long hair down to my lower back. All summer I would sweat to death. Putting it up didn\u2019t help since it still felt like I was wearing a wool hat. I begged to have it cut. Got told no every time. And I\u2019m talking 14 years old with zero say over my own damn hair. \n\nThen I came home with lice one day. That woman tried her hardest to comb through my hair, but finally had to concede defeat, and I got my hair cut to my shoulders.", "I gave every kid in my neighborhood bangs! Badly! (tbf, I was also a small child)", "I\u2019m the same. Butt length hair my whole childhood. Got a pixie cut now, best decision I ever made", "She's been old enough to voice an opinion for years now.   At what age do you think mom would have let her opinion matter?", "That\u2019s really the issue here - OP took it upon herself to act as the parent when she disagreed with her sister\u2019s decision. \nWhether you agree with it or not, you don\u2019t get to jump in and go against decisions regarding children that are not yours. \nWe don\u2019t know the day to day for this 5 year old, maybe she deserves autonomy and maybe not. But her aunt doesn\u2019t get to make those decisions because she thinks her opinion is of higher value - she\u2019s TA", "I disagree on this particular instance.  A five year old for sure can know what she wants for her hair and a haircut should not be considered a big decision.", "Getting your hair cut isn\u2019t a big decision, and there are so many compromises between long hair that gets in your way and a pixie cut.", "On top of a 5 year old plenty old enough to decide about her hair, clothes, toys she wants to play with, etc., it's just hair. The amazing thing is that no matter how you cut / color it, it will grow. This is not a permanent alteration.", "Yes,  I would definitely vote ESH if I put a top level comment!", "Because her sister treats her child like a doll whose hair she gets to brush and show off. I bet she looooves the attention her kids hair gets.", "OP could also be over-stating how much the kid is complaining and expressing that her hair bothers her, in an attempt to make OP's actions look better.", "Idk, I feel like OP was making it sound worse than it was. I have 2 young daughters who have both have had longer and shorter hair at times. They both constantly complain about their hair bothering them, but still wanted it long and my oldest cried after getting it cut. She had been asking for a while for a cut and I made her wait just to be sure that's what she really wanted, and still she cried about that hair and has finally grown it out again. I have long hair and almost always wear it in a ponytail. It's normal for a 5 yr old to have hair in their face if it isn't tied up. I don't get why OP didn't just put it in a braid.  \n\nTBH, the way she described her niece's hair in the first part gave me the impression that she was jealous of her niece and the attention she (and OP's sister) received from it. Going on about how beautiful it is, just to later chop it all off just felt very Disney villainous to me.", "\"I'm a no-bullshit sort of person who tells it like it is...\"", "When it's clearly caused someone harm. Yeah, I hate that phrase, and realize there's a 99.9% chance that I'll find an AH behind it when I read or hear it.", "According to my cat all cats are arseholes.", "Why would we believe anything OP says; she\u2019s shown us she is an unashamedly dishonest person. It sounds to me like she was jealous of her niece\u2019s hair and for all we know is just saying niece asked for short hair to make herself look like less of an AH.", "Absolutely. It's ridiculous. There were like 5 other options that were better, but no. *OP* knew what was best for her niece over her own mother. /s. \n\nI wonder if that poor girl is gonna wake up tomorrow and be upset her hair is gone..", "Lol username checks out. It was my sisters school.", "I hate the length where it\u2019s too short to pull back but still long enough to be in the face.", "Yeah. I\u2019m leaning towards ESH. The parents for keeping her hair that long and most likely not listening to her desire for it to be more manageable. And OP for making that decision herself.", "That's just sexist", "But Interesting-Bed-5451 didn't make a distinction between daughters and sons; they just said mom is the sole decider on haircuts and (maybe) dad. \n\nIt seriously comes off as just another comment trying to knock dads down a peg or two. Fathers deserve just as much of a say in haircuts or anything else that happens to their children, regardless of gender, as a mother.", "Hair in my house (growing up) was entirely up to mom\u2026 in my how now, it\u2019s still pretty much up to mom\u2026 I might not be the norm, but in my experience, the moms have much more emotional investment in the hair of both gendered kids.\n\nJust my experience/two cents. But you might be right in general.", "It helps teach them consent in an age appropriate way too. They get agency over what it done to their body like with a haircut and clothing.", "Yeah, my main problem here is OP was the one who brought it up and children that age are particularly prone to \"leading the witness\" so to speak.", "Same! We\u2019re supposed to decide who is the asshole based on the information given! Why can\u2019t people do that", "Haha valid. I\u2019m just like\u2026what are we even doing here if we\u2019re going to pick and choose who we think is telling the truth.", "I agree OP should not have cut the hair. I also think that I have enough information to determine that the kid\u2019s mom is being weirdly controlling about her hair. If she wants a haircut, let her get a haircut. She\u2019s not a doll.", "That\u2019s literally every post here. Bias in some way or another", "Legally? No.", "The problem here isn\u2019t whether or not the parent should have allowed the child a haircut. The issue is the obvious boundary OP crossed knowing she didn\u2019t have permission.", "Yeah, but this is literally all we know about them, and only through the lense of somebody who just betrayed their trust.", "Oh yeah, same here. My hair is *ridiculously* thick. The weight of my own fucking hair used to give me horrible migraines. And I would beg to have it cut because I was a teenager when Friends was on and EVERYONE had some version of the Rachel. And nope - my mother wouldn't even let me get it *trimmed*. Ever. Because according to her, hair looked \"unnatural\" when the ends were straight. \n\nI went to college with that same damn hair, and I was in a pseudo-military program. One of the requirements of the uniform was to have the hair neatly above the collar, but it also had to be low enough to wear the hat. So I had to get ass-length hair all neatly up at the lower back of my head, and did I mention that my hair is also an escape artist? So I was constantly getting work hours in addition to my course load, because my hair was breaking uniform rules.\n\nAnd when I finally did go to get it cut, I had split ends that went all the way up to my bra line. My hair was so badly damaged and so unhealthy that it couldn't even be donated, and even when I told her that, she was STILL adamantly insisting that I had \"ruined my beautiful hair.\" I'm almost 45 years old and I STILL get angry just thinking about it. And I'm sitting here like man, I should have tried getting lice! \ud83e\udd23", "How do we know she told her mom she didn't like it. She only told OP when she was asked. Op was just wrong.", "Is that how it works?

What I've found about that is that it's not terribly difficult to train myself to simply not say the first thing that comes to mind. When you're like me, that first thing that wants to pop out of your mouth just isn't going to have a lot of thoughtfulness behind it. It's probably going to be funny as fuck, to *some* people, but low odds on it being actually helpful. So if I'm not absolutely sure of my audience, that first thought just gets bounced back for the fun-police review.", "Can confirm.", "How exactly has she shown herself to be \u201cunashamedly dishonest?\u201d That\u2019s a stretch of olympic proportion, imo. She\u2019s in the wrong, for sure, but how does that lead you to the conclusion that literally *everything else* she says must be a lie? It just seems ultra convenient to believe the *one thing* she says that supports your conclusion while declaring the rest of it as inherently untrustworthy.", "As a barber, usually it\u2019s just mom that cares. Dads typically want easy to maintain haircuts while moms want cuter(longer) haircuts", "I\u2019m a father to two girls and a boy, so I have some personal insight. \n\nThis post is just here to stir up shit. \n\nThank you for attending my Ted Talk.", "I've seen a lot of comments about baby names requiring \"2 yeses.\" I think first haircuts should have the same rule.", "I would assume it's because mom's usually end up being the one to style/maintain the hair, not necessarily that dad's should have any less say. \n\nKinda like getting a puppy, the person who will mainly take care of it should have more say than the person who just lives in the house with it.", "Because in the VAST majority of cases the mother is the decider. They included fathers at all as a way of covering for the exception to every rule. They said \u201cmaybe\u201d as a criticism of the fact that so few fathers get involved. They are saying men SHOULD take responsibility, but don\u2019t.", "And consequences! If she got the haircut she wanted and later regretted it, she\u2019d learn from that regret without it having any long term impact on her life at all. She\u2019d learn what regret feels like, it\u2019d grow back, it would be an age appropriate lesson! This is exactly the sort of stuff she should get a say in, because if you wait long enough, it\u2019ll fix itself.", "Idk, OP was pretty clear that she had observed a longterm history of her niece\u2019s distress, along with numerous instances of admiring shorter hairstyles. It would be one thing if OP visits once a year and did this, but it seems pretty clear they are regular parts of each other\u2019s lives.
