Now my bf is super mad at me and is giving me the cold shoulder until I apologize. I don\u2019t think I need to apologize, they took my stuff that held quite a bit of money and hid it. For all I knew someone could\u2019ve taken the money and I would have nothing to turn in. My friends said I over reacted and think I also need to apologize, I don\u2019t think so.
