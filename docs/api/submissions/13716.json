Left my then boyfriend over the same behaviour, because it was just a symptom for some other flaws in his character (showed later in the relationship).

Honestly OP, it\u2019s time you realized that he probably doesn\u2019t care how you feel about this and he never has. He likely just agrees with you in the moment to get you to shut up. Tell him that his attitude about the whole thing is not helping anything, and if he wants this relationship to work he needs to come to the table ready to talk this out like an adult.", "NTA.

He\u2019s placing his leisure above your core needs and that\u2019s never okay. \n\nAlso there\u2019s no reason to need to be loud during a video game. Most people manage to be perfectly respectful during a game.", "Wow, our men are the same. My fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for 4 years, and lived together for about 2-3 mostly because of Covid. We moved in together because we both worked at the hospital and our parents were considered the at risk population. But he also loves to game, also screams profanities, also plays super late into the night/early morning, and is also very passive aggressive when I ask him to chill out. My best advice: \n\n1. When he gets passive aggressive and says things like \u201cI\u2019ll just stop\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll throw out my computer\u201d I just remain calm and don\u2019t let it be an argument. I\u2019ll say nothing, let him chill out, and say \u201cI don\u2019t care that you play, but I have to sleep, so if you could just be a little quieter that would be appreciated\u201d and that usually ends the argument right there. \n\n2. I actually found a way to sleep with the noise, idk if that\u2019s an option with you or not but now that I am use to it, I won\u2019t wake up when he starts to get rambunctious. If he is too loud I will just look at him and he will apologize and be quiet the rest of the night. \n\n3. Try having a conversation about it when he isn\u2019t in the middle of the game, maybe at dinner when you are both relaxed. My fianc\u00e9 is obviously fired up when he\u2019s in the middle of gaming with his friends and that\u2019s why I will get more emotional responses when I confront him then.", "i had this problem 4 yrs ago, lived together in a studio, sometimes one of us would be awake much longer than the other due to different work shifts and so stay on PC into the night\n\nif she was sleeping i wouldn't join any voice comms, there was just the sound of my keyboard\n\nif i was sleeping she would join calls because gaming in silence was a foreign idea to her, and didn't try very hard to talk quietly. i would yell 'keep it down!' round the corner and she'd whisper for maybe 2 minutes max before shouting at the game as if she completely forgot i exist. i got many bad nights of sleep on weekdays because of this.\n\ni don't know if you have the same case, but being disrespected by her was a trend in our relationship that eventually ended it", "YTA.
