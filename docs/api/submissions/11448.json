We became best friends. Sophomore year she wanted to move off campus and her parents brought a condo for her to use. The condo was a large two bedroom condo. She asked if I wanted to move in with her and pay rent. Her parents agreed to pay utilities. I didn\u2019t want to stay on campus and she was offering to charge me the same rent I would be paying for a small studio apartment in the city our college is located. So I agreed. \n\nThe agreement was I pay her and she forwards the money to her parents. Now here is where the issue arises  when I moved in I believed that we agreed to a rent of let\u2019s say $1,500. According to her parents, I agreed to $1,600. \n\nI have lived with my gf for three years now and I always paid $1,500. The difference came to light when she told her parents we are now dating. Her parents were upset and told her that she cannot date a thief. My gf told me this and I asked her to explain. Basically, when I first paid her $1,500, her parents asked about the difference. GF was afraid to bring up the issue with me as she didn\u2019t want us to start fighting over money as we were close friends. She said that she thought I might have just be low on money as my family isn\u2019t as well off as her and I was working part time job and using student loans to help cover rent. She never told me about the difference and I continued to pay $1,500 for the entire time we have lived here. So now her parents assume I stole almost $4,000 from them. \n\nIt has gotten to the point that they refuse to even acknowledge we are dating at all. My GF and I turned my room into an office/workspace room as we didn\u2019t need to two bedrooms as we are now sharing a bed. She told her parents and their response was that maybe sleeping on the couch will get me to pay them the money I owe. \n\nI cannot afford to pay them $4,000. My GF acknowledges that she should have told me something but said her parents are adamant that they get paid because they feel like I took advantage of their generosity. I don\u2019t want to blame my GF and I doubt her parents will accept my word but I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to pay them when I didn\u2019t realize this was an issue. So AITA for refusing to pay $4,000 to my GF\u2019s parents?\n\nEdit: Responding to some common questions. \n\nMy GF has told them that she didn\u2019t bring it up to me. They believe that she is just making excuses for me and that I knew what the rent was. \n\nWe didn\u2019t do a formal lease it was all through phone calls and texts. We haven\u2019t been able to find any texts as they all occurred freshman year. I know we were stupid not to do a lease but we didn\u2019t think it was necessary. \n\n After the first conversation and GF deciding not to bring it up, the issue slipped her mind. She swears her parents never brought it up again until she told them we were dating. I had no idea this was an issue. My GF doesn\u2019t think I have to pay it but she suggested we pay it together because her parents won\u2019t let it go or talk to me unless it\u2019s me apologizing for taking advantage of their and GF\u2019s generosity and to pay what they say is owed.", "created_utc": 1677938412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hzsjh/aita_for_stealing_from_my_gfs_parents/", "score": 1612, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Paid to a THIRD PARTY. If third party states a fact, that isn't a reason to NOT RELAY THE CORRECT INFORMATION. Your gf failed to disclose facts, she is the one who has been dishonest THE ENTIRE TIME. \n\nDo you want a partner that brushes things under the rug then allows them to fester into a huge issue that could have been resolved easily at first with a simple statement of facts?

Leases have terms and expiration dates. Many states require leases for longer than a year to be in writing. Usually, there is also a legal requirement for how many days the landlord has to notify the tenant of an insufficient payment, and it's a lot less than 3 years. If they told their daughter (and frankly, I doubt the rent was ever supposed to be $1,600), and the rent check didn't go up the next month, then it's definitely on them to contact their tenant directly. It's their legal responsibility as landlords, not hers. Also, the fact that they are charging OP rent equivalent to a studio apartment makes me feel they've been actually scamming OP this whole time. Rent for a studio apartment is not 1/2 rent and utilities for a 2 bedroom. It is higher. I don't know where OP lives, but in my area, the average rent for a studio is 2/3rds the average rent for a 2 bedroom. Data I found for national averages in the US is from Q2 2020, and it says national average studio rent was $1,690 while 2 bedrooms were $1,878. A fair price for a sublet of one bedroom in a two bedroom place using these numbers would be $939. It's not clear to me if these numbers are for rents including or not including any utilities, as many landlords do include electric, gas, water, sewage, and trash. One of the apartment hunting websites says average cost of utilities is $120.73 for a studio and $197.46 for a two bedroom (for those utilities that are often included in a lease). So if we assume the $939 isn't already including utilities, and even if you add on half the internet bill, we probably aren't talking more than $1,100 for half the cost of a 2 bedroom - and this condo is located in an area where the studio apartment cost is less than that average cost in the US. Of course, mortgages are always less than rents on the same property, so the parents are unlikely to be paying anything like $1,878 a month. It seems to me that the parents have been ripping OP off to the tune of about $400 a month, and quite happy with it until the announcement of the relationship. Frankly, I wonder if the $1,600 isn't the full cost of the mortgage, rather than OP's agreed portion.", "I agree. If I am reading the post correctly, the purchase of the condo did not include the prerequisite that the daughter get a roommate paying $1,600 a month. Given that OP paid consistently all of those years, there's no reason they should think it was bad faith. They should have dealt with it themselves if it was unacceptable.

Didn't have to be anything complicated, just a statement of how much rent, when it's due, and signed by everyone involved.", "NTA. These are adults right? Property owning adults?

If the money is the problem & that is a big If, then it was her duty to pay them both when rent was due, once she found out there was a problem & now 3 years later. There is something fishy though to me about the rent, $1500 a month for a college student? Why did you think that was a good idea? Please don't call them & don't pay them at all.", "NTA. Your gf instigated this entire thing. Convincing them is on her. Also they are a little bit dumb for accepting partial rent.

Now they was to penny pinch and get what's owed, even when you paid the amount you were told in good faith?\n\nNTA, you have a GF problem, not an inlaw problem.

She needs to make it right, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. You don't say how they feel about you both being women, but it definitely seems like they want to break the two of you up.

Either the parents or the girlfriend. \n\nIf you have paid $1500 a month in rent and they accepted it and never kicked you out or asked about it, then that is the settled rent. \n\nIt could be the girlfriend wasn't giving the parents all the money and is blaming you and keeping it secret from you until now when it's time to meet the parents. \n\nOr the parents did mention it to the girlfriend every time they accepted rent 'Only 1500 AGAIN?'. And girlfriend still knew. \n\nIt sounds implausible that this suddenly is an issue, and no one was aware of the situation or said anything earlier. \n\nYou're being scammed.", "NTA, you didn't know and its an honest mistake.\n\nThough you also can't let it keep going without dealing with it, the longer it goes unresolved, the worse its going to be.  You and your GF need to talk with her parents and come to a fair or equitable agreement.\n\nYou were not aware that the price was supposed to be $1600, so its an honest mistake.  Now that its out in the open, all you can do is come up with a plan to make it right.  You can maybe offer to start paying $1600 if they will forgive the 4,000.  Maybe you can pay the $1500 and your GF can pay the $100 difference.  Maybe you and your GF can start paying them $1650/month until the $4,000 is paid back.  Or you can break up and move out.  Or you can just refuse to pay until they turn it into a bigger issue that causes huge stress in yours and your GF's relationship.  Or you and your GF can cut them off and go NC and find a new place together where they aren't paying for part of it.\n\nThere are options, and you, your GF, and her parents will all have to come to an agreement on it.  If her parents refuse to come to the table and have a civilized, adult, conversation, then its up to your GF to mediate between them, and for her to decide where her priorities lie, with you, or with them.  If they do agree to come to the table, then make sure they know from your side there was never any slight intended and you want to make everything right.  You can't afford $4000 right now, but propose some options you'd be willing to do, like the ones I mentioned above or something else you're willing to do to at least show you're *trying* to remedy the unintentional slight.\n\nYour GF has a lot of the blame here for never mentioning it before and letting it get to a point where its out of hand.  And she needs to step forward and help mediate a solution between her parents and you two.  But ultimately, if you plan on continuing to date her, and she's dependent on them for the roof over both of your heads, you need to be wiling to bend a bit to try and keep them happy.\n\nEdit: Oh and get a written agreement on whatever you discuss.  It doesn't have to be much, can just be on a pad and paper and everyone can verbally agree to it or sign it, as long as its written down in some way so it can be referenced, it can be digital and in email as long as there is confirmation from both sides.

You are not a thief, they have absolutely no proof of this, this is absurd.\n\nThis is a way of controlling their daughter and is ridiculous.", "NTA.

Or did you negotiate the amount with your GF and then she acted as a go between with her parents? \n\nBased in the info you provided, I suspect your GF was the go between.

A contract is what is with the 4 corners of the paper.
