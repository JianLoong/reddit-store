We became best friends. Sophomore year she wanted to move off campus and her parents brought a condo for her to use. The condo was a large two bedroom condo. She asked if I wanted to move in with her and pay rent. Her parents agreed to pay utilities. I didn\u2019t want to stay on campus and she was offering to charge me the same rent I would be paying for a small studio apartment in the city our college is located. So I agreed. \n\nThe agreement was I pay her and she forwards the money to her parents. Now here is where the issue arises  when I moved in I believed that we agreed to a rent of let\u2019s say $1,500. According to her parents, I agreed to $1,600. \n\nI have lived with my gf for three years now and I always paid $1,500. The difference came to light when she told her parents we are now dating. Her parents were upset and told her that she cannot date a thief. My gf told me this and I asked her to explain. Basically, when I first paid her $1,500, her parents asked about the difference. GF was afraid to bring up the issue with me as she didn\u2019t want us to start fighting over money as we were close friends. She said that she thought I might have just be low on money as my family isn\u2019t as well off as her and I was working part time job and using student loans to help cover rent. She never told me about the difference and I continued to pay $1,500 for the entire time we have lived here. So now her parents assume I stole almost $4,000 from them. \n\nIt has gotten to the point that they refuse to even acknowledge we are dating at all. My GF and I turned my room into an office/workspace room as we didn\u2019t need to two bedrooms as we are now sharing a bed. She told her parents and their response was that maybe sleeping on the couch will get me to pay them the money I owe. \n\nI cannot afford to pay them $4,000. My GF acknowledges that she should have told me something but said her parents are adamant that they get paid because they feel like I took advantage of their generosity. I don\u2019t want to blame my GF and I doubt her parents will accept my word but I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to pay them when I didn\u2019t realize this was an issue. So AITA for refusing to pay $4,000 to my GF\u2019s parents?\n\nEdit: Responding to some common questions. \n\nMy GF has told them that she didn\u2019t bring it up to me. They believe that she is just making excuses for me and that I knew what the rent was. \n\nWe didn\u2019t do a formal lease it was all through phone calls and texts. We haven\u2019t been able to find any texts as they all occurred freshman year. I know we were stupid not to do a lease but we didn\u2019t think it was necessary. \n\n After the first conversation and GF deciding not to bring it up, the issue slipped her mind. She swears her parents never brought it up again until she told them we were dating. I had no idea this was an issue. My GF doesn\u2019t think I have to pay it but she suggested we pay it together because her parents won\u2019t let it go or talk to me unless it\u2019s me apologizing for taking advantage of their and GF\u2019s generosity and to pay what they say is owed.", "created_utc": 1677938412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hzsjh/aita_for_stealing_from_my_gfs_parents/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Granted, this probably could have been avoided if you had spoken to the parents first, or signed a rental agreement with the amount disclosed in a contract. \n\nHas gf told her parents she misspoke and gave you the incorrect information? Because if not, I'd honestly worry why my partner didn't clear up a situation YEARS ago that they didn't clear up from the BEGINNING because \"I didn't want us to fight\"... WTF?  It's RENT. Paid to a THIRD PARTY. If third party states a fact, that isn't a reason to NOT RELAY THE CORRECT INFORMATION. Your gf failed to disclose facts, she is the one who has been dishonest THE ENTIRE TIME. \n\nDo you want a partner that brushes things under the rug then allows them to fester into a huge issue that could have been resolved easily at first with a simple statement of facts?

You both have some maturing to do. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for the payment issue, but the rest of it? Yeesh.", "There's no insulting happening here. Open ur eyes...", "They literally DIDN'T insult your girlfriend.", "Why doesn't your gf pay the $4,000? This is a problem that SHE CREATED, so she needs to be the one to fix it.", "Sorry, but everyone else is right: your gf is the problem, and she's the only one who can fix this. *She* failed to tell you about her parents' demand (for more than three years!!), and *she* needs to tell them that. She is also the one who is allowing them to get away with insulting you and refusing to meet you, and she needs to stop. \n\nShe needs to make it clear to her parents that *she* dropped the ball, and you had no idea about any of it. She also needs to realize that, if they continue to maintain that she's lying to protect you, that means that her \"close\" \"loving\" parents think she's a manipulative liar \u2013 and she needs to state that plainly to them. She needs to stop hiding behind her fears and stop letting things go unsaid. She needs to make it clear that she will not stand for their continued mistreatment or exclusion of you. If they want to have a relationship with *her,* then they need to treat *you* decently.", "You can actually try to request a copy of the texts from back then if you are using the same phone service. They may store them. Worth a shot.", "You don't owe them money, not legally, not morally. And if you pay them you're only confirming that you did steal, which will harm the relationship.\n\nIf you want to fix the relationship, suggest a contract with a rent increase to 1600 going forward. Only increase the payments when you have the contract.\n\nIf you don't stick to your story they won't believe you, and will bring up the false accusation forever. Your story is you had a verbal contract for 1500, and since they accepted the payments for 4 years, that's their story as well. If you tell the truth you have no reason to pay them 4000, the only reason (in their minds) to pay them is if you know you lied.", "What reason do her parents have to think that she is lying? Has she been dishonest in the past with them? She's certainly made a habit of lying to you. I suspect she has been known to them as a liar for a very long time and that's why they don't believe her now. \n\nIs honesty important to you in a relationship? If it is, then this relationship is not sustainable. What about healthy communication? Even if you believe her that they only brought the discrepancy up once, years ago and it slipped her mind, why wouldn't she be able to communicate that now? Which takes me back to the original point, your gf's parents seem to have reason not to trust her. I would, at the very least, look further into that. \n\nThe red flags are a-flying.", "This could also be a major reason", "VEry sorry, did not mean to misgender anyone.  Need more coffee.", "I definitely wouldn't be payin them one single penny of that $4000. I'd be afraid that once I caved and paid that what would they next try to bully me into doing? I feel like it just sets a bad precedent. One where the parents throw a temper tantrum to get whatever they want at the moment even if they have to lie and manipulate to do so.", "Before dating, I didn\u2019t really talk to them. They would visit but I would normally being my own thing. My GF did not notice any issues prior to us starting to date. She said she would talk about me and her and what we were doing (going out with friends, watching a movie, etc) and her parents never made any comments that they didn\u2019t like me or anything.\n\nAt this point they refuse to talk to me unless I apologize and pay the money.", "It seems awfully coincidental that this isn\u2019t mentioned for 3 years and it\u2019s only when you made your relationship public that they now make an issue.", "NTA.  This is all your GF\u2019s fault, due to her lack of communication on the proper rent amount.  She\u2019s the one who owes her parents $4000.", "Honey, your gf is throwing you to the wolves. Walk away", "NTA your gf is an idiot and she should pay the difference. I would not hand over a cent since you have been paying the agreed upon amount.", "NTA. Your gf is and so are her parents. Do you really want to stay with someone that basically lied to you all these years?", "NTA the financial agreement was between you and your gf. What her their parents thought agreement was is irrelevant. Honestly it souds like the parents are trying to sabotage  your relationship", ">I don\u2019t want to blame my GF\n\nYou should blame your GF as this mess is entirely her fault. She should have communicated the actual rent price with you. And she is responsible for fixing this with her parents.", "NTA, and as many have said here the parents are likely just coming up with whatever excuse they can to disapprove of the relationship without admitting to being homophobic.\n\nImo this is grounds for a breakup. Can you imagine building a life and finances with a girl who is willing to throw you under the bus, and not mention such a huge disparity in rent/payment with you when it was first brought up? She does not have your back and isn't willing to stand up for you.\n\nGet out. Asap.", "This seems like bait and switch by parents and a oops by the GF\u2026it seems like barely veiled homophobia cuz a 1500/mo for a 2 br apartment as a roommate and they have the nerve to bitch about 4k because of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d.  They can obviously afford it\n\nNTA not your fault", "What? This is insane. Wth do you mean you don't want to blame your gf? It's completely and utterly her fault. And next in line is her parents for not talking to you themselves. They're adults, it's their property and their responsibility to collect money they think is due to them. You don't owe them a dime. If they insist it's owed to them, then gf needs to pay up. ESH", "NTA but your gf sure is.  She could have taken care of this with a direct, honest conversation with her parents,  admitting her fault. \nHer not doing that is bs.  You don't owe the money but you got to go come May.   \nShe caused this issue and is now throwing you under the bus. Time to move on.", "Not having a lease was as dumb for them as it was for you. They can't prove you owe them anything, they've not made any effort to contact you, they've accepted what you *have* paid them, this is entirely on them. NTA.\n\n> Her parents were upset and told her that she cannot date a thief.\n\nThis is just an excuse to break you up. If it was actually about the living situation they *could have actually contacted you at some point*.", "You don\u2019t legally owe them the money. Don\u2019t pay them. NTA", "NTA.", "Nta but move out immediately The moment they lied, you should have started packing", "Her parents don\u2019t want this to be fixed.\nYour girlfriend, by not telling you, is responsible and she did nothing to fix the situation.  It is on her and you should not be billed for half as you had no idea of it.  Your girlfriend may have withheld the extra cost for fear you would not move in if the rent went up.\n\nIf you hand her parents $4,000, they will not suddenly warm up to you because the money isn\u2019t the real issue.", "Info: Does your girlfriend acknowledge/remember that she told you $1500? Or is it possible she actually agrees with her parents that it was supposed to be $1600? It seems like she thought all along you weren't paying the full amount but it was just a misunderstanding she didn't want to cause a fuss about. If she's telling her parents it was a misunderstanding, I could see them not believing her. Seems like an unlikely misunderstanding.\n\nBut if she's telling her parents the truth, that she lied to you (or made a huge mistake thinking her parents said $1500) back then about the amount, and after her parents brought it up at the time, panicked and lied and kept lying by omission, I can see them not believing her because that's also an unlikely situation.\n\nI think it's more likely, her parents are homophobic and she doesn't want to be cut off financially by taking a stand against that, so she's letting them pretend it's about money. I'm guessing her parents always said $1500 and never spoke to her about it being $1600 and she's willfully misremembering and has convinced herself it was a misunderstanding so she doesn't have to believe they're homophobic and hateful.\n\nBecause really, why would they be fine with their daughter having a roommate for several years who was a thief but suddenly, when their daughter is dating said thief, decide to make a huge fuss about it, if it wasn't the their daughter dating YOU that was really the problem?\n\nNTA really, no matter the answer to the question I started with. But I don't see this going well for you.", "NTA you have been paying what you believe to be the appropriate amount every month. Frankly as grown adults and the owners of the property, they should have insisted on a written lease the minute you agreed to move in, that\u2019s their own fault. Also I really don\u2019t understand why your girlfriend didn\u2019t just deal with this the very first month.", "NTA.\nDo not pay.

Nta.", "Lol OP owes GF\u2019s parents $4,000 and THEY\u2019RE the assholes???? Only on Reddit, I swear. OP YTA. Grow and talk to the parents yourself. Work on paying them back in installments.

Now they don\u2019t collect any rent.", "Why do you think they\u2019re homophobic? Because they don\u2019t want their kid dating someone who stole from them? Imagine that!", "Yes because having one of the LGBT as your child these days is quite fashionable but not having one of the poors date your child... Ugh... Gross.\n\nNTA they're making a mountain out of a molehill and the lack of proper communication by all parties other than yourself is the issue.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Even if you\u2019d done a lease, the fact that they cashed a $1500 check every month means that was the new negotiated rent. \n\nThe fact that her parents\u2019 misunderstanding affects you\u2019re relationship at all as ADULTS is a red flag.

They came to visit their daughter, they knew where OP lived, but they never mailed a letter asking fir the rent, or mentioned it while visiting?\n\nNo, this is not on OP.  If she pays them the $4k they are not going to turn around and start being nice to her, that's not have passive aggressive people like this work.", "Found the landlord. OP was never billed for it in 3 years, they dont owe shit. They can start paying the new amount if they continue to live with the GF.", "OP doesn't owe them shit unless they can prove it. There not being a lease is as dumb for them as it is for OP. They've not ever mentioned the price discrepancy to OP so OP was merrily going along paying what she thought she owed. \n\nWhich in the absence of a lease and the absence of any word otherwise sounds like it is de facto 1500.", "She owes them nothing, there's no agreement and they only sprung this additional payment on her now that they know their daughter is dating OP.
