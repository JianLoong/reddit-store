We became best friends. Sophomore year she wanted to move off campus and her parents brought a condo for her to use. The condo was a large two bedroom condo. She asked if I wanted to move in with her and pay rent. Her parents agreed to pay utilities. I didn\u2019t want to stay on campus and she was offering to charge me the same rent I would be paying for a small studio apartment in the city our college is located. So I agreed. \n\nThe agreement was I pay her and she forwards the money to her parents. Now here is where the issue arises  when I moved in I believed that we agreed to a rent of let\u2019s say $1,500. According to her parents, I agreed to $1,600. \n\nI have lived with my gf for three years now and I always paid $1,500. The difference came to light when she told her parents we are now dating. Her parents were upset and told her that she cannot date a thief. My gf told me this and I asked her to explain. Basically, when I first paid her $1,500, her parents asked about the difference. GF was afraid to bring up the issue with me as she didn\u2019t want us to start fighting over money as we were close friends. She said that she thought I might have just be low on money as my family isn\u2019t as well off as her and I was working part time job and using student loans to help cover rent. She never told me about the difference and I continued to pay $1,500 for the entire time we have lived here. So now her parents assume I stole almost $4,000 from them. \n\nIt has gotten to the point that they refuse to even acknowledge we are dating at all. My GF and I turned my room into an office/workspace room as we didn\u2019t need to two bedrooms as we are now sharing a bed. She told her parents and their response was that maybe sleeping on the couch will get me to pay them the money I owe. \n\nI cannot afford to pay them $4,000. My GF acknowledges that she should have told me something but said her parents are adamant that they get paid because they feel like I took advantage of their generosity. I don\u2019t want to blame my GF and I doubt her parents will accept my word but I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to pay them when I didn\u2019t realize this was an issue. So AITA for refusing to pay $4,000 to my GF\u2019s parents?\n\nEdit: Responding to some common questions. \n\nMy GF has told them that she didn\u2019t bring it up to me. They believe that she is just making excuses for me and that I knew what the rent was. \n\nWe didn\u2019t do a formal lease it was all through phone calls and texts. We haven\u2019t been able to find any texts as they all occurred freshman year. I know we were stupid not to do a lease but we didn\u2019t think it was necessary. \n\n After the first conversation and GF deciding not to bring it up, the issue slipped her mind. She swears her parents never brought it up again until she told them we were dating. I had no idea this was an issue. My GF doesn\u2019t think I have to pay it but she suggested we pay it together because her parents won\u2019t let it go or talk to me unless it\u2019s me apologizing for taking advantage of their and GF\u2019s generosity and to pay what they say is owed.", "created_utc": 1677938412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hzsjh/aita_for_stealing_from_my_gfs_parents/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s definitely info missing with this", "INFO: Was there a written agreement that confirms that the went was $1.5k? Were the GF parents aware of this?", "Y'all need to move out of the condo, cuz that 'rent' is asinine.  Sounds like the parents probably bought the place outright, but 1500 would likely be as much or more than the loan payment would have been.  If the girlfriend were paying an 'equal' share, that would be like 2500 rent and 500 for utilities.  \n\nThe parents are using their money as a form of control, and getting out from under it is going to be the only way to move forward.  But in the present issue, GF ITA.  She can't or won't stand up for you or herself, and if she's unwilling to move out with you, then she's firmly under their control.  At bare minimum, since it was that big of a deal, she could have made up the difference and added 100 bucks to have your back.  She's not paying anything else, but the princess couldn't have even bothered to do that.\n\nI'm not saying make an ultimatum, if she wants to stay in the condo, fine, but huge red flag.  If you want to stay, which I think is DUMB AS HELL, maybe you could pay 1800 a month and that'll pay off the 4000 in a lil over a year and a half, maybe before you guys graduate??  At least show the parents that you're making amends.", "GFriend is an ahole. How can you fix a problem if there is no clear communication? Yes, the parents connected the dots which led them to think you shirked your responsibility.  - NTA.  If you want to mend bridges, sit everyone down and discuss what steps would rectify the situation. Best to you.", "Has your GF explained to them what happened? Why would they need to accept your word when she can just TELL them. She\u2019s TA, from what I can see.", "If it isn't in writing anywhere and your GF failed to communicate the mistake at any point, then you're NTA. \n\nThe GF needs to take responsibility and have a conversation with her parents about how she failed to communicate properly with everyone. I don't think they should expect you to pay the difference unless there is a written agreement that you signed.", "NTA and your girlfriend should be the one to pay it since she\u2019s the one that didn\u2019t tell you anything. You paid all the money you knew you owned. She has to explain everything and pay her parents back.", "NTA - BUT I get the feeling her parents are well off and do not want you as a son in law.  Sorry", "Wait, have they never visited nor ever brought it up to you directly?  Weird as fuck.\n\nSorry to say but not only do you have to blame your gf but you must do it as a surprise in front of them/her.  Explain it as it is. Tell them you were of the belief that it was $1500, she never told you, you had no idea there was an issue until she said something.  Point iut its ridiculous to think you shorted them $100 a month deliberately.  This must be a surprise to your gf. If not they will think you contrived what happened together and she is protecting you.  Need the genuine reaction.\n\nOh, and edited to add, NTA.", "I\u2019m torn here between no AH and everybody sucks. I get that this began when you were 18, but you\u2019re now 21 and supposedly moving towards a permanent relationship. This needs to be cleared up like adults do. The FOUR of you need to have a sit down, and there needs to be documentation. SURELY at some point you had an email, a text, a contract, something that enumerates what was agreed to. \n\nIf there is no such documentation, your GF needs to stand up to her parents and say: \u201chey, I was there, I was a party to this agreement, it was $1.5K and your refusal to move from this position is going to be problematic given that OP and I are planning a life together, so you need to decide what\u2019s more important: this conflict or your future relationship to your daughter.\u201d \n\nIn the spirit of generosity, I\u2019m going to go NAH.", "So you've been living together for 2+ years and they never brought up the disparity in rent with you until now? Sounds like they're trying to hide their thinly veiled homophobia behind money.

It\u2019s incredibly unfair that her unwillingness to have a conversation (with them about why you paid $100 less, and with you about how much you were supposed to pay) has gotten you and only you in hot water.

She fucked up, she should fix it.", "Do you now pay the 1600$?", "Did your girlfriend try to explain to her parents that all of this mess is because of HER miscommunication? \nOn one side I can understand parents fearing to have her daughter exploited for \u2018cheap rent\u2019. On the other hand is 1 not your fault but your girlfriend for communicating to you a different amount of money. And THEM cause they should have clarify the discrepancy with you a long time ago. Also for 100$ really?", "If there\u2019s no written agreement, just move out. That all sounds so annoying. Your gf is a literal child and threw you under the bus, no idea why you\u2019d think you were an AH. Parents sound like a nightmare honestly. No one would expect a college student to just magically have 4k so they\u2019re giving you an impossible task because they don\u2019t like you for \u201cother\u201d reasons, I\u2019m sure. Especially the fact that gf and her parents seem to talk about this a lot and yet no one can be an adult and talk to you directly. \n\nCall them. Leave a message if they don\u2019t answer and explain what happened. Then get tf out of there, leave that spineless amoeba of a girlfriend there.", "INFO: Why didnt you guys make a written agreement? You know, leases are a thing??? And why is your GF so passive in all of this?", "NTA. GF is for simply not telling you. You pad $1500 in good faith ad had no reason to believe they wanter more. Parents are AH for being landlords and saying nothing to you directly if they thought you were not paying enough.", "NTA but her parents really need to work on those comunication skills. Radio silent about rent for 3 years but can run their mouth to call you a thief? And your girlfriend also sounds a bit immature, but I guess at the time you guys were 17 so I can understand with lots of mental gymnastics why she wasn't comfortable communicating with you properly about it then. \n\nYou should all just sit down and talk it out like adults.", "NTA and why didn't your gf settle this with her parents? SHE was the one that did not USE HER WORDS to clarify the situation. She is the person that needs to iron this out with them, you were told 1500 by her, so you paid 1500. Granted, this probably could have been avoided if you had spoken to the parents first, or signed a rental agreement with the amount disclosed in a contract. \n\nHas gf told her parents she misspoke and gave you the incorrect information? Because if not, I'd honestly worry why my partner didn't clear up a situation YEARS ago that they didn't clear up from the BEGINNING because \"I didn't want us to fight\"... WTF?  It's RENT. Paid to a THIRD PARTY. If third party states a fact, that isn't a reason to NOT RELAY THE CORRECT INFORMATION. Your gf failed to disclose facts, she is the one who has been dishonest THE ENTIRE TIME. \n\nDo you want a partner that brushes things under the rug then allows them to fester into a huge issue that could have been resolved easily at first with a simple statement of facts? Because that is evidence of really poor communication skills and conflict avoidance manipulation. Life has conflict, she cannot always avoid it by never bringing it up, that's super unhealthy. Discussing misunderstandings is what ADULTS do...", "NTA. If they thought you weren\u2019t paying up their responsibility was to raise it with YOU, their tenant. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them $4,000. You thought the agreement was $1,500, they claim they thought it was $1,600 but that you just shorted them for FOUR YEARS without them once bothering to raise it? That wouldn\u2019t hold up on court, and they\u2019re shitty for badmouthing you for it when they wouldn\u2019t even talk to you about it.\n\nYour GF needs to take responsibility and clean this up. No \u201cI tried.\u201d Either she does this, or OP, you might need to consider move on.

She told her parents but we are pretty sure they don\u2019t believe her and think she is just making excuses for me. She doesn\u2019t want to get in a fight with them because they are a close family and she relies on them for money still. I mean we are still living in their condo. So it\u2019s complicated. \n\nI said this in another comment. My GF said they never brought it up after the first month to her. It slipped her mind after that conversation when she didn\u2019t bring it up immediately. I don\u2019t talk to her parents directly so it\u2019s not like I can raise it.

They are a super close family and they really think they are being helpful. they are just stubborn people and won\u2019t accept that I honestly didn\u2019t know about the difference in rent because I should have known what I agreed to pay.

If she can\u2019t or won\u2019t, you got troubles.", "Then it's not your fault, even if you only saw them briefly, they had a chance to bring it up a lot sooner than years down the line. If I was renting to someone and they underpaid on what we agreed, I wouldn't let that sit for a day let alone years. If there's no written agreement then they probably can't force you to pay the difference, especially given how long they've left it. Your girlfriend needs to stick up for you and take the blame. I would seriously consider finding somewhere else to live. They're not going to approve of you no matter if you solve the issue or not because they're homophobic, they'll just find another reason to dislike you.", "Not with the parents, they chose not to communicate directly, so be it! \nI meant she can address this with her GF. The GF can solve it with her parents, or accept that her SO and parents will never get together and just drop the subject.", "Nah you can\u2019t play that game.
