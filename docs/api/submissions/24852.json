For a very long time I made it obvious I had feelings for him but he only ever liked my friends. After a while I moved on to my current partner (we have currently been dating for 4 years) and just over a year ago I moved in with my partner and to celebrate my friends (including this friend) took me out for drinks. The night was great and we all had a great laugh planning future weddings and imagining what we want our futures to look like. \n\nAs the night ended my phone died so I had to walk home as I couldn\u2019t call my partner for a lift and couldn\u2019t remeber his phone number. My male friend of 10 years offered to walk me home so I was safe, me trusting him completely said okay and we heading back to my house. \n\nOn the way home he complimented me and started trying to hold my hand, I politely said thanks for the compliment and declined the hand. Soon after we got out of the busy town area he tried to kiss me and kept telling me how I looked nice and that I should be with him. I of course pushed him away told him to get himself home and I would walk the rest alone, as he was clearly too drunk. He continued tho pinning me against the wall trying to kiss me and touch me. I kept trying to push him off and telling him no, luckily there was someone walking on the other side of the street who interrupted asking if everything was okay, this scared the \u201cfriend\u201d and he bolted. I walked home and told my partner all about the nights events. \n\nAfter sleeping on it the friend messaged saying he only did what he did because he was jealous and his drink was spiked. I didn\u2019t believe this and told him to never contact me again or I\u2019d tell everyone about what happened. He agreed and never spoke again. Fast forward to now and I was at my baby shower and him and some of his friends were in the same place we were, he started making some nasty remarks about being 20 and \u201cknocked up\u201d and how I\u2019m a waste of space and disappointment and other not so pleasant things. \n\nNow I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the hormones and stress of coming to the end of my pregnancy but I got so angry that I told everyone there exactly what he did to me. And of course his reputation among peers has been ruined. He seems to have a new number and messaged me calling me every name under the sun as I broke my promise by telling people what happened that night. So AITA? Should I have just let him continue saying them things to me?", "created_utc": 1692276011, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tmd4f/aita_if_i_told_everyone_what_my_friend_is_truly/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were more than generous with your \"deal\" \nThen he decided as soon as he saw you to start trouble. If he'd kept his mouth shut u probably wouldn't have said anything.\nTBH though, you didn't even owe him that courtesy. You could have said something back then but u didn't. Not saying that's ur fault, i get it. However you owe this guy nothing! Maybe a kick in the pants but that's it!", "An instruction not to contact you includes a unspoken but well-understood base rule: keep my name out of your crusty fucking mouth. He broke the rule, all bets are off. \n\nNTA.", "NTA he sexually assaulted you. That is not something you should ever have to keep secret to protect him. He is a predator. He also verbally abused you when you didn't keep his secret. \n\nDO NOT feel guilty about telling the truth, you telling the truth may just protect some other woman who may have felt safe in his presence. \n\nHis reputation being ruined is on him. If he doesn't want people to know about his predatory ways then he shouldn't attack people.", "NTA - block every number he uses to contact you. If it persist  report it to the police. \nIt's important you look after yourself, something like that can be quite confronting and suppressing it doesn't necessarily help. Lean on your friends and family who you trust and if need be, please considering speaking to a therapist or psychologist to help.", "NTA\nYou don\u2019t have to keep his horrible actions secret to save his reputation. He assaulted you, and it\u2019s well within your right to tell anybody you\u2019d like. On top of that, he provoked you by saying horrible things about you behind your back. If he was truly that concerned about keeping that night a secret, he should have never spoken your name again. He deserves for everyone to know he\u2019s gross. \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy! Keep your true friends close, and enjoy your new family.", "Why do we always protect shitty people? Do you think this was a one-time occurrence? I bet he's pulled that, \"someone spiked my drink crap\" before. This person was saying horrible things about you, and you were supposed to take his verbal abuse for what reason? Friendship? \n\nNTA, I'm sure people were wondering what happened to your 10 yr. friendship, and it was time they found out. He could have kept his mouth shut. Not acknowledge you. He chose to talk shit and now he gets to eat it. \n\nSociety needs to stop protecting shifty people and their shifty ways. Maybe they would change their behavior if they were held accountable.", "NTA. Plain and simple, no explanation needed.", "NTA. You should have reported his attack to the police.", "NTA\n\nPlaying with fire, expect to get burnt.\n\nI hope you and your partner have a wonderful healthy baby.", "NTA \u2026 he\u2019s an asshole and deserves to be called out for the trash he is", "Nta. You font need to preserve predator.", "You had every right to put him on blast AND report it to the police. Report him if he  ever contacts you again.

I\u2019ve been SAed by someone who I considered a friend at the time and, like you, promised not to tell anyone. I later found out he had blocked me from every social media form and was trash talking me to everyone. So I told everyone what had happened and regretted not to do it sooner. Good for you for coming clean, you don\u2019t have to keep his secret.", "NTA. His reputation is not your problem. His behaviour was awful, and he deserved what he got.", "NTA\n\nHe should not have done those things to you that night and he should have not said those things. At least what you said was true.", "NTA. First, you never really \"promised\" him or owed him anything. Second, pretty sure making nasty remarks about you loudly enough that you could hear even though you were presumably in different groups at the venue counts as \"contacting\" you for the purposes of this situation, so he absolutely brought this consequence on himself.", "NTA. Although I think you probably should have warned others, based on your prior friendship, I think the compromise to not tell if he never contacted you would have been fine. Until he started making those shitty comments at your baby shower. Then it's no holds barred. You did right by telling them, albeit a bit tardy.\n\nAlso, good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!", "NTA, if anything you could be seen to have had a moral obligation to let your mutual circle (which I'm assuming contains other women around him) be aware what he can be like at a minimum when he's intoxicated.", "NTA\n\nHe clearly has a trend that when he is jealous, he does and says horrible things. Good for you for holding him accountable now. He poked the bear to be honest vs just keeping his mouth shut, and you bit back.

That\u2019s assault and you might have a stalker. If he keeps trying to contact you or is threatening, call the cops, get a protective order.", "NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019d screenshot his vile messages to everyone he knows. People like him operate in secret because they are cowards.", "NTA - repeat after me you owe him nothing!", "YTA. Not because of what you did, but because of what you didn\u2019t do.

All of what happened is on him.", "I completely understand not saying anything, although I think you should\u2019ve, it\u2019s never something I could hold against you, these experiences tend to leave us traumatized and just wishing it would all go away and pretending it never happened.
