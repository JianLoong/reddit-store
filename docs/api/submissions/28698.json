We both work full time and my husband makes a little more than me, but just a little. We make enough to be financially secure - we can afford all the necessities and rent a 2 bedroom apartment, but we have never traveled (aside from weekend road trips) and probably won't be able to in the foreseeable future.\n\nMy husband's family is quite well off. A few weeks ago, my MIL called my husband and asked if he wanted to bring our kids to go on a trip with her. She apparently wanted to spend some time with her family. Her \"family\", though, doesn't include me. She has always disliked me and never considered me part of her family. Partly because I'm not religious (my husband is, but he respects my lack of belief), and also because she just doesn't like me. \n\nMy husband knows this and hasn't ever forced me to interact with her, but he still talks to her occasionally. Anyhow, he told me that my MIL had offered to pay for him and the boys to go on a two week trip with her around Thanksgiving time. I'm not invited, she said I'm \"not really her family, so she doesn't want to pay for me too\". (This is what she said word for word, according to my husband.) She knows that we cannot afford for me to pay to come on this luxury trip. She can afford it pretty easily herself. I was pretty upset about this, because I'd love a break too, but I understand that the kids will love this so I said that of course they should go. \n\nI tried to be cheerful about it but my husband understood that I was upset, he asked my MIL specifically to please invite me too so that we can have proper family trip. She reiterated that i might be his family but I'm not her family. I told him not to push it, because I want my kids to have a good time without my husband and MIL fighting during the trip. \n\nBut I've been feeling pretty angry about the whole thing. So yesterday when my son asked me why I wasn't more excited about the trip, I told him I wasn't coming because his grandma hates me. I said this in a bitter tone. They were pretty upset to hear this. \n\nLater, my husband told me I was an asshole for dumping my feelings on my kids, and making them feel guilty about looking forward to the trip. He said I was ruining it for them and also ruining their relationship with my MIL (they're pretty close), and that I'm being selfish. So do you think I'm in the wrong?\n\n(Edit- typo)", "created_utc": 1697035919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175fvpf/aita_for_telling_my_kids_that_my_mil_hates_me_and/", "score": 10424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think she can be trusted not to bad mouth you in front of the boys if she's willing to be so open about this, either. You do need to stand up for yourself and shut this down. Do not send this precedent that it's ok for your kids to take a major \"family\" vacation without their mother at this age, especially with someone who has openly disrespected you and your marriage.\n\nHonestly, while you were honest with them, kids do need to be left out of adult fights. That said, this entire situation is something they noticed and they will continue to notice. If you didn't tell them, they would figure it out.

My grandmother doted on me and my sister and spoiled us. We loved her. It wasn\u2019t until I was a teenager that I started to notice something was off. She\u2019s my maternal grandmother and therefore my mother\u2019s mother. I started to realize how much my mom truly disliked, even hated my grandmother. The more I observed the more I realized how awful my grandmother treated her. Always critical and judgmental. Borderline abusive. Finally after a long while of observing this I asked my mom about it. We had always been so close. She hesitated but ultimately decided I was old enough to hear it. My grandmother physically, emotionally, and verbally abused my mother her entire life. As a child she was beaten badly and often. My aunt, her younger sister, was a wild child and my mom recounted the first beating she saw my aunt get and decided then and there to take the blame for everything so my aunt was never hurt again. My grandmother was an abusive, manipulative, and narcissistic woman. My mom shirked us from that side of her our whole lives so we could have a relationship with her and not feel cheated out of having a grandma. But ultimately I felt like I had spent years betraying my own mother, my best friend, the most important person in my life. She stood by quietly watching me love her abuser. It had to have been so hard for her. Yes, my opinions of my grandmother changed that day and I began to distance myself from her. But I will always choose my mother. \n\nYour kids are old enough to start seeing the truth. They don\u2019t deserve to be deceived by her.

End of discussion. \nIt's even more of a slap in the face that this is an ongoing problem.\nYou are very graceful to put your feelings aside for your children. BUT - 8 years old is old enough for them to start noticing things. They are going to start learning that it is okay to treat you like this because dad and grandma do. These boys are going to think this is how you treat a lady. If you want to raise respectful men, start now by showing them how a healthy relationship looks like.  \n\nI have mom guilt galore, and have said things to my kids that I'm not proud of. So this isn't judgement, but advice I wish I told myself. You shouldn't have said what you said to the kids. Take this as a teaching moment about how everyone can say something in the heat of the moment.  Tell them the truth but in a kid friendly/civil way. I also hope this serves as a teaching moment for you.  Don't agree to something if you can't actually agree with it. Ir don't say that they can go when it makes you angry. Hiding feelings is a slippery slope, and at 8, they are picking up on it.\n\nNow on to your husband. Is this a hill to die on? Only you can decide.

We both work full time and my husband makes a little more than me, but just a little. We make enough to be financially secure - we can afford all the necessities and rent a 2 bedroom apartment, but we have never traveled (aside from weekend road trips) and probably won't be able to in the foreseeable future.\n\nMy husband's family is quite well off. A few weeks ago, my MIL called my husband and asked if he wanted to bring our kids to go on a trip wuth her. She apparently wanted to spend some time with her family. Her \"family\", though, doesn't include me. She has always disliked me and never considered me part of her family. Partly because I'm not religious (my husband is, but he respects my lack of belief), and also because she just doesn't like me. \n\nMy husband knows this and hasn't ever forced me to interact with her, but he still talks to her occasionally. Anyhow, he told me that my MIL had offered to pay for him and the boys to go on a two week trip with her around Thanksgiving time. I'm not invited, she said I'm \"not really her family, so she doesn't want to pay for me too\". (This is what she said word for word, according to my husband.) She knows that we cannot afford for me to pay to come on this luxury trip. She can afford it pretty easily herself. I was pretty upset about this, because I'd love a break too, but I understand that the kids will love this so I said that of course they should go. \n\nI tried to be cheerful about it but my husband understood that I was upset, he asked my MIL specifically to please invite me too so that we can have proper family trip. She reiterated that i might be his family but I'm not her family. I told him not to push it, because I want my kids to have a good time without my husband and MIL fighting during the trip. \n\nBut I've been feeling pretty angry about the whole thing. So yesterday when my son asked me why I wasn't more excited about the trip, I told him I wasn't coming because his grandma hates me. I said this in a bitter tone. They were pretty upset to hear this. \n\nLater, my husband told me I was an asshole for dumping my feelings on my kids, and making them feel guilty about looking forward to the trip. He said I was ruining it for them and also ruining their relationship with my MIL (they're pretty close), and that I'm being selfish.

I'm a huge believer in \"there is no such thing as having too many people to love your kids\". \n\nBut I think in this case that's not the issue. The issue is that one of the most important people in these children's lives - their own mother -is being openly mistreated, and while it's important to model love for kids, it is an equally important part of that to model \"how we treat people, especially family, with dignity and respect.\"\n\nI didn't learn until I was an adult that my paternal grandparents were unkind to my mother. They didn't even hate her, they were just . . . unkind and thoughtless to her. And I kind of wish I had known that earlier, even if it had affected my relationship with them. I think it would have given me a clearer understanding of a family dynamic that I found confusing, mostly because I was being told one thing but the adults' demeanour didn't reflect what I was being told. I suspect that it's similar in OP's case.\n\nKids are stupid. Those twins are being told that grandma is loving and kind, but their mom is being excluded from things. Which means that they know either they are missing a piece of the puzzle in the family dynamic, or Mom deserves to be left out (which is unfair and untrue). Perhaps she shouldn't have said it with bitterness in her voice, but she wasn't entirely wrong to be honest that she was being excluded from a \"family trip\" because grandma didn't like her and didn't want her there.

I would be more on that side if this was a child the mil was excluding because she didn't like them rather than anything they'd actually done, but when it's two adults, I'm more on the side that adults are old enough to realize not everyone wants to hang out with them. It sucks to have that be the dynamic with a parent in law and I could see it being a deal breaker over time for sure.

He can deal with his mum or not, but he can\u2019t pretend it isn\u2019t noticeable and upsetting for some people any longer. You could also add that the loyalty and hurt that the kids are feeling about this should give him pause to consider how his \u2018head in the sand\u2019 attitude has been hurtful too and he might need to start deciding where his actual loyalties lie, because next time this comes up you\u2019re leaving Daddy to explain the \u2018why isn\u2019t Mummy invited\u2019 to the kids directly.", "NTA.

To bad OPs husband isn\u2019t.", "My only qualm is that when husband was pushing the issue of her not being invited, OP told him to drop it so as not the ruin the trip for the kids.  Then she goes ahead and sabotages it anyways.  Husband and Grandma are definitely AHs, and I wouldn't trust them to be honest as to why she wasn't coming anyway.  Like you, I don't understand why they agreed to go in the first place.", "right? It's out of a novel. I think the husband is a complete AH. Besides not handling the disinvite, he didn't even think about sending the children and having a break with his wife.", "As in, \"I don't go on vacations without *MY* family.\"", "Because he is a spineless, ball-less loser wimp of a husband.", "Worse than spineless: Disloyal", "Yeah, it's why I finally decided I'm not dealing with it anymore", "I have a dear friend who was in a very similar situation. Rich in-laws who didn't like her. Husband wouldn't stand up for her. In the end, they divirced, and I believe that situation had a lot to do with it.", "Mine, too! Whoever that good man is! \u2705\ud83c\udfc6\ud83e\udd47", "The wet noodle spine was probably conditioned in since birth.  While my husband has a lot more spine (my exclusions are more subtle) he has a \"she won't listen/changd so why waste the energy getting upset and fighting with her?\" mindset.\n\nHe did refuse to take our daughter to visit for over a year after she shrugged off her dog bitting our child, unprovoked. He only went back after she took herself and the dog to training, and then only for short visits to test the effectiveness of the training.\n\nAll and all, his spine way stronger than his now-divorced brother. His brother, while hot headed and stubborn to the rest of the world, shows as much resistance to his mom as OP's husband. Example... MiL walked tnto B's house and announced \"I'm taking your 2 week old baby for the weekend, so you can get some sleep.\" SiL walked in, confused, as her newborn was being carried out the door.  B had handed him over without even talking to her! \n\nSo, yea... spineless. And divorced by the time their son was 13.  \n\nMy daughter figured out by 6 that her grandma was deliberately breaking rules with her, over stupid, petty things as a power play.  I have no doubt that, by 8 OP's the boys noticed something off. It probably wasn't as blatant as excluding mom from vacation before. It is probably why *they asked her.*\n\nNTA. Pretty sure the boys had been figuring things out for a while, despite the *close relationship.* My daughter still play the dutiful, loving grandkid, and her grandma still thinks she's the favorite grandma... But as the years go on, she's getting more defensive over how I'm treated. I'm not sure she'll continue to bite her tongue as she gets into the teenage years. It'll be interesting.", "Actually its op who tells him not to..do you need reading comprehension..op supports her husband and kids being close to mil..meaning stop putting stanfmdards op doesnt ask for.", ">But there's an inheritance to consider. If he puts his foot down, he thinks he'll be cut from the will.  (Being sarcastic here.)\n\nno, that's probably hitting the nail right on the head.\n\nRich people LOVE cutting their kids out of wills.  I swear they live for that shit so they can die with a fucking smile on their face thinking about their kids not getting shit...", "husband is TA, not OP. Address that. She should not be expected to hold her tongue when it is his job to have her back.", "Too late for him to grow a pair tho", "I joke I like my oldest\u2019s girlfriend more than my son & would take her on vacation. I love & adore my son, but I have more in common with his girlfriend (like me she loves true crime & we can talk about that & musicals for hours or go see one. My son would go, but wouldn\u2019t be his cup of tea). I had a crappy MIL, I vowed to never be one! My son would never speak to me again if I pulled this! And he would be right!", "\"Where we go one we go all!\"", "That's a possibility.  It is also possible that they consider OP to be nothing more than breeding stock.  As soon as the children are older he will dump OP.  MIL will make the divorce miserable.", "Thanks! She is. My whole family is. I didn\u2019t know one of my cousins was actually a step cousin until I was 11. And both my maternal and paternal grandparents always counted stepgrandkids, and even kids who were just the child of somebody that a family member was dating, always counted as grandkids and were treated exactly the same. It took me awhile to realize how lucky I had it as a kid.", "That actually happened to my MIL with her ex husband. Super sad situation.", "I was in my mid-20s before i realized my parents practice of \"any friend welcome\" wasn't more widespread. We'd even have an ex-partner continue to visit on holidays for a few years after they'd stopped dating.  I don't have any step kids, but I'm 1000% sure they would feed/ gift them just the same, too.", "I know a couple like this. He was the only child of a single mother and she thought that meant she owned him forever. When he met his now wife, his mother went crazy. Constantly interfering. Showing up on their doorstop unannounced to stay for indefinite time periods. Talking down to his then fianc\u00e9. Being awful. It ramped up around their wedding and shortly after the wedding he had to put his foot down particularly hard about boundaries. She was so angry that he stood up to her that she cut him off and never saw or spoke to him again. She\u2019s never met her grandkids. I find it utterly bizarre! I guess it was always all about her and not about him at all.", "Oh not the holidays thing, just having to put up with the test pilot in a broom factory because we don't want to adversely affect the kids."]}
