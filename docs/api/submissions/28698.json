We both work full time and my husband makes a little more than me, but just a little. We make enough to be financially secure - we can afford all the necessities and rent a 2 bedroom apartment, but we have never traveled (aside from weekend road trips) and probably won't be able to in the foreseeable future.\n\nMy husband's family is quite well off. A few weeks ago, my MIL called my husband and asked if he wanted to bring our kids to go on a trip with her. She apparently wanted to spend some time with her family. Her \"family\", though, doesn't include me. She has always disliked me and never considered me part of her family. Partly because I'm not religious (my husband is, but he respects my lack of belief), and also because she just doesn't like me. \n\nMy husband knows this and hasn't ever forced me to interact with her, but he still talks to her occasionally. Anyhow, he told me that my MIL had offered to pay for him and the boys to go on a two week trip with her around Thanksgiving time. I'm not invited, she said I'm \"not really her family, so she doesn't want to pay for me too\". (This is what she said word for word, according to my husband.) She knows that we cannot afford for me to pay to come on this luxury trip. She can afford it pretty easily herself. I was pretty upset about this, because I'd love a break too, but I understand that the kids will love this so I said that of course they should go. \n\nI tried to be cheerful about it but my husband understood that I was upset, he asked my MIL specifically to please invite me too so that we can have proper family trip. She reiterated that i might be his family but I'm not her family. I told him not to push it, because I want my kids to have a good time without my husband and MIL fighting during the trip. \n\nBut I've been feeling pretty angry about the whole thing. So yesterday when my son asked me why I wasn't more excited about the trip, I told him I wasn't coming because his grandma hates me. I said this in a bitter tone. They were pretty upset to hear this. \n\nLater, my husband told me I was an asshole for dumping my feelings on my kids, and making them feel guilty about looking forward to the trip. He said I was ruining it for them and also ruining their relationship with my MIL (they're pretty close), and that I'm being selfish. So do you think I'm in the wrong?\n\n(Edit- typo)", "created_utc": 1697035919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175fvpf/aita_for_telling_my_kids_that_my_mil_hates_me_and/", "score": 2495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think she can be trusted not to bad mouth you in front of the boys if she's willing to be so open about this, either. You do need to stand up for yourself and shut this down. Do not send this precedent that it's ok for your kids to take a major \"family\" vacation without their mother at this age, especially with someone who has openly disrespected you and your marriage.\n\nHonestly, while you were honest with them, kids do need to be left out of adult fights. That said, this entire situation is something they noticed and they will continue to notice. If you didn't tell them, they would figure it out.

My grandmother doted on me and my sister and spoiled us. We loved her. It wasn\u2019t until I was a teenager that I started to notice something was off. She\u2019s my maternal grandmother and therefore my mother\u2019s mother. I started to realize how much my mom truly disliked, even hated my grandmother. The more I observed the more I realized how awful my grandmother treated her. Always critical and judgmental. Borderline abusive. Finally after a long while of observing this I asked my mom about it. We had always been so close. She hesitated but ultimately decided I was old enough to hear it. My grandmother physically, emotionally, and verbally abused my mother her entire life. As a child she was beaten badly and often. My aunt, her younger sister, was a wild child and my mom recounted the first beating she saw my aunt get and decided then and there to take the blame for everything so my aunt was never hurt again. My grandmother was an abusive, manipulative, and narcissistic woman. My mom shirked us from that side of her our whole lives so we could have a relationship with her and not feel cheated out of having a grandma. But ultimately I felt like I had spent years betraying my own mother, my best friend, the most important person in my life. She stood by quietly watching me love her abuser. It had to have been so hard for her. Yes, my opinions of my grandmother changed that day and I began to distance myself from her. But I will always choose my mother. \n\nYour kids are old enough to start seeing the truth. They don\u2019t deserve to be deceived by her.

End of discussion. \nIt's even more of a slap in the face that this is an ongoing problem.\nYou are very graceful to put your feelings aside for your children. BUT - 8 years old is old enough for them to start noticing things. They are going to start learning that it is okay to treat you like this because dad and grandma do. These boys are going to think this is how you treat a lady. If you want to raise respectful men, start now by showing them how a healthy relationship looks like.  \n\nI have mom guilt galore, and have said things to my kids that I'm not proud of. So this isn't judgement, but advice I wish I told myself. You shouldn't have said what you said to the kids. Take this as a teaching moment about how everyone can say something in the heat of the moment.  Tell them the truth but in a kid friendly/civil way. I also hope this serves as a teaching moment for you.  Don't agree to something if you can't actually agree with it. Ir don't say that they can go when it makes you angry. Hiding feelings is a slippery slope, and at 8, they are picking up on it.\n\nNow on to your husband. Is this a hill to die on? Only you can decide.

We both work full time and my husband makes a little more than me, but just a little. We make enough to be financially secure - we can afford all the necessities and rent a 2 bedroom apartment, but we have never traveled (aside from weekend road trips) and probably won't be able to in the foreseeable future.\n\nMy husband's family is quite well off. A few weeks ago, my MIL called my husband and asked if he wanted to bring our kids to go on a trip wuth her. She apparently wanted to spend some time with her family. Her \"family\", though, doesn't include me. She has always disliked me and never considered me part of her family. Partly because I'm not religious (my husband is, but he respects my lack of belief), and also because she just doesn't like me. \n\nMy husband knows this and hasn't ever forced me to interact with her, but he still talks to her occasionally. Anyhow, he told me that my MIL had offered to pay for him and the boys to go on a two week trip with her around Thanksgiving time. I'm not invited, she said I'm \"not really her family, so she doesn't want to pay for me too\". (This is what she said word for word, according to my husband.) She knows that we cannot afford for me to pay to come on this luxury trip. She can afford it pretty easily herself. I was pretty upset about this, because I'd love a break too, but I understand that the kids will love this so I said that of course they should go. \n\nI tried to be cheerful about it but my husband understood that I was upset, he asked my MIL specifically to please invite me too so that we can have proper family trip. She reiterated that i might be his family but I'm not her family. I told him not to push it, because I want my kids to have a good time without my husband and MIL fighting during the trip. \n\nBut I've been feeling pretty angry about the whole thing. So yesterday when my son asked me why I wasn't more excited about the trip, I told him I wasn't coming because his grandma hates me. I said this in a bitter tone. They were pretty upset to hear this. \n\nLater, my husband told me I was an asshole for dumping my feelings on my kids, and making them feel guilty about looking forward to the trip. He said I was ruining it for them and also ruining their relationship with my MIL (they're pretty close), and that I'm being selfish.

I would be more on that side if this was a child the mil was excluding because she didn't like them rather than anything they'd actually done, but when it's two adults, I'm more on the side that adults are old enough to realize not everyone wants to hang out with them. It sucks to have that be the dynamic with a parent in law and I could see it being a deal breaker over time for sure. I've seen marriages come apart because of wedges placed by ILs, but I've also seen husbands and wives who just go with \"she hates me, but loves my kids so we don't hang out and she just dotes on my kids\" route and they just continue about their lives.

They can say, you don't have to choose between your mom and your grandma, but just be aware of how your gma feels about your mom and the stakes you can lose if you choose not to be close to gma. A lot of ppl would say that's a sell out, but those ppl probably don't know what it feels like to be financially insecure. I, personally hate being fake but I also hate being financially insecure, it would be a very, very tough call for me, but it's my call to make. I'd definitely have a little resentment towards someone who chose financial insecurity for me even if I would've chosen it myself, cuz I'd never know if I'd have chosen it myself. I don't have kids though and idk what would be age appropriate to share with 8yos, but they understand more than parents think. It is a tough situation to be sure.", "my dad never had a relationship with my great grandmother and I barely knew her growing up. Cos she hated my grandma so much my grandpa eloped with her. She didn't think she was good enough for my grandpa. But they were married 71 fucking years before he passed, so they must have had something going on to last that long.", "I knew with complete certainty that my Nana didn't like my Mum, noone ever said it but it was very blatant.", "That umbilical cord is long.", "Only to have the ~~brainwashed~~ overly religious granny to leave every  penny on the  cult they are in. That'd be hilarious.", "What he should\u2019ve done is clearly tell his mom \u201cwe travel as a family. Invite my wife or we don\u2019t come at all. In fact, treat her with kindness and respect generally or else get used to never seeing your grandkids again.\u201d It\u2019s called manning up and protecting your family. He chose to be a small boy begging for mommy\u2019s approval instead. Weak. Pathetic.", "She said it to 8 year old children that their Grandmother hates their mother... wtf is wrong with you? Yes that's dumping unnecessary emotional baggage on her children...\n\nThat is some shit that the adults in the room handle without bringing their kids into it.", "When you get married, you need to prioritize your new immediate family.", "and young kids don't enough knowledge yet to really give things context.", "I disagree. It\u2019s the truth. She\u2019s not going because she\u2019s not invited. And while she can guess or presume the reason, the only one who knows for sure is Grandma.", "Yes, she also could have said grandma didn't invite her. Although no one should have agreed to this in the first place specifically because the kids aren't dumb. They'll wonder where their mother is. Involving them in this at all is bad and outright telling them \"grandma hates me,\" does nothing to help the situation. Now they're wondering if grandma hates them too or if they should hate grandma. They shouldn't have to think about that. The time and place to complain is to the husband before this even happened. Complaining to the kids just puts adult issues on their shoulders and it's not good parenting. You don't get a pass on being a bad parent just because you're in a shitty situation.", "That\u2019s a fair point", "The gran isn\u2019t doing anything to the kids though she\u2019s not excluding them, she has a good relationship with them.", "Nope don\u2019t protect them and don\u2019t lie, but telling your kids who are learning about love and hate and family dynamics that their grandma hates them in a sour tone isn\u2019t the approach.", "The printer is slow, but there's so many moving parts in there when it's done!", "My husband said I'm the biggest troublemaker in the family because I gave birth to our kiddos.", "Like a Resin printer.  Printed in Goo, extracted from the goo, cleaned off, inspected to be sure all parts are present, supports removed (placenta), and then put in a warming bed to \"cure\" \n\nLol", "the world's first 3D printer: the uterus", "Good relationships are worth more than money. I would hope that the children aren't being taught to be so mercenary in their relationships.", "Then parents can prove by their love that there are things more important than money.", "Hopefully the mom bought seats on the plane next to each other so it doesn\u2019t get in the way of other passengers \ud83d\ude02", "He was arguing with his mom until OP TOLD HIM TO DROP IT. He did not let it slide until OP TOLD HIM TO.  He was fine with standing up for her until SHE TOLD HIM NOT TO. And I thought Tumblr had no reading comprehension. The fact of the matter is that if he had continued arguing with his mom after his wife TOLD HIM NOT TO. This sub would be calling him the AH for ignoring what SHE TOLD HIM TO DO. Maybe the caps will help.", "Would it have been better if she said I\u2019m not going because your grandmother doesn\u2019t consider me family? Or lie and take the blame herself making her kids think she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with them? \n\nMIL is the one that put this emotional baggage on the kids. They are 8 not 3 and they probably have already noticed that grandma is weird with their mother. \n\nPlus 8 years olds hate people all the time and they forgive them all the time. They hate their siblings regularly but still love them. They\u2019ll get over it. They\u2019re probably more upset their mom can\u2019t come on the trip. \n\nHonestly if I\u2019m her that grandmother will no longer be spending time with the kids because people who try to alienate parents from their families don\u2019t get to be a part of the family.", "\"The children shouldn't be put in the middle, so I am going to tell them to go question her\"\n\nThe children are stuck in the middle no matter what. Your strategy isn't better, just different. \n\nThe only way for them not to be stuck in the middle was for dad to grow a spine and tell mil to fuck off.", ">if they should hate grandma\n\nWell, maybe they should.", "She doesn't deserve one because she is disrespecting the mother. And it will be a matter of time before the kids find out. The sooner the better.\n\nThe mother should not be a doormat in accepting this abuse. An expensive holiday is not being away from her kids at Thanksgiving.\n\nHusband is an AH for condoning this. I hope this grandma is put on LC soon.", "It's the truth and it's what it is. mom should not have to cover for hater Grandma while she is being abused. kids asked and she answered. Mom is more important to the family than grandma and Dad should act accordingly.", "This is so cute and sweet!", "UV light and all!", "Look moron. I\u2019ll make this short and sweet: OPs hubby never should have said \u201cyes\u201d in the first place. Should\u2019ve been one convo: invite us all, or get used to not seeing any of us. Not this weak \u201cI\u2019ll say yes then try to negotiate to have you come along too shit.\u201d That\u2019s what makes him a coward.

Children are not friends that you need to get on your side.", "I don\u2019t really understand what the problem is with taking a trip without one parent; it seems fairly normal for one side of a family to go on holiday together", "Absolutely agree that grandma and dad are tied for worst people. Mom should not have to cover for her a-holery. I still maintain that \u201cgrandma hates me\u201d is not the way to frame the information when OP admits it visibly made the kids upset.", "Where does she say he accepted without talking to her. Show me. Point out where he said yes to the trip without talking to her first. Because usually people don't omit things on AITA that make them look better. Which that would. Point it out for me since I'm a moron.", "In this case Dad asked if Mom could come and Grandma said no. It is a holiday time - that is a problem. Grandma is deliberately and obviously excluding the mother during the holidays.\n\nAny reasonable and discerning person would have a problem with that."]}
