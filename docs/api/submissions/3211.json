Clearly he rather let his family openly insult you than to create any kind of boundary with them. \n\nDon't bother with his family anymore, no matter how much Grant begs for you to do so.

That\u2019s why you end up doing all of the sacrificing (not seeing your own family at the holidays, putting up with awkward situations, dealing with shade, etc.), and he does none. Right now, he gets everything he wants and you get nothing. That will continue\u2026forever basically. Break up with him now. Who knows, maybe that will motivate him to change his relationship with his parents, and if it does great you can maybe get back together in the future but I\u2019m telling you from personal experience that probably won\u2019t happen. \n\nYou deserve someone who is proud to be with you, who would take an insult against you to be against themselves as well, who listens and prioritizes your feelings. That\u2019s just not this guy.", "no of course you are NTA, the moment the ex was invited the parents lost any right to say anything.

If your partner is allowing that then maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider your relationship.  \n\nHow disrespectful and slap in the face that they invited his ex over.  You are a  way better person. I would\u2019ve packed my things and left.  His family sounds like horrible people.", "NTA you deserve someone who will stand up for themselves and you.

I guess if the ex is just part of the friend group maayyyybbeee it wasn\u2019t intentional. And maybe they were genuinely happy to see him. Let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt. But after they saw you get upset and then it all came to a head. They should have been apologizing to you. The fact they responded with he has to earn our respect seems like they are just being jerks. I\u2019m sorry OP.", "I go NTA.\n\nI wouldn't expect his family to start warming up to you, regardless of what Grant thinks. I think, with them, you need to realize that the best you can hope for from them is resignation. They will never like you, but they might come to accept the fact that you're a permanent fixture in his life and they'll just have to deal with it. I don't see anything you or Grant can do to change that. They like what they like.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears that Grant's family, especially the male members, are failing to extend even basic courtesy. They should not be giving you the frosty treatment when you haven't done anything wrong. I don't think, if Grant brought home a more traditional male boyfriend, he would have gotten the ice treatment that you got. Grant should insist to his family that they need to treat you with respect and courtesy, even if you don't meet their ideal. \n\nAnd there is one more thing I can fault Grant for. He should have left with you the moment he saw S\u00e9bastien. What Grant needs to do, should you plan on joining him for Christmas, is tell his parents that if they invite S\u00e9bastien, he will leave with you. They might argue that they're friends with S\u00e9bastien, but Grant can counter with the fact that none of his brothers' exes were invited to Thanksgiving.", "NTA.\n\nGrant's family is bunch of bigots. So what if you don't fit in their idea of \"manly man\" their son should date? I'm afraid they won't change this attitude and continue to treat you this way. They were willing to intive his ex and literally say \"hey this is the one you are supposed to date not him\" \n\nYou deserve to be treated with respect.
