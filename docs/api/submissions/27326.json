We are both from Delhi, India, and have been together since high school. We maintained a long-distance relationship during college, and we have been living together for the past year and a half. We've moved to different houses once for 2 months within the same city during the time we lived together.  \nRecently, I discovered that she had hooked up with a friend during that time and found some Plan B pills in her room. I confronted her about this and she said the pills were her friend's. Initially, she did not disclose the truth, but after further discussion, she confessed to having hooked up with a friend. She explained that she was sexually attracted to his dominant personality and enjoyed the sex with him. She mentioned that, while she finds me good in bed, she doesn't feel the same level of dominance with me, possibly because of how much I care about her.  \nShe's been very emotional and has expressed her desire to be with me while also stating her wish to remain truthful, including having occasional sexual encounters with this other person, perhaps once every six months. I'm struggling with whether I'm being unreasonable for not allowing this and whether I'm placing too much importance on sex in our relationship. I'm considering focusing on other aspects of our relationship that are strong and possibly exploring my own sexual experiences with other people. I've even suggested breaking up so that we can both have the freedom to explore, but she insists on settling down with me and does not want to look for other partners due to a lack of energy for that endeavor. She wants to spend her life with me but also desires occasional sexual encounters with this person.  \nBut deep down I know this would not work and wants to break up with her. When I mention this she says I am not being reasonable and focussing too much on sex.  \nPlease let me know if I should mark it as NSFW.", "created_utc": 1695299008, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oeimi/aita_for_not_letting_my_girlfriend_have/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if sex is not there we can continue the relationship and we have very very strong bond.

My advice; Care less. Get out of there dude.", "NTA - OP, she cheated on you. Period. That's it. There's no reason or excuse she can give that validates her actions. \n\nAll you can do at this point is determine your boundaries. If cheating is a hard no, then it's time to break up with her. Shes shown you that you cannot trust her. Not with your emotions or with your health. \n\nThe fact she had Plan B says she had unprotected sex with this guy and then also had u protected sex with you. You need to get screened for STIs. \n\nOpen relationships require an insane amount of trust and communication. Y'all have neither. The trust is gone and I stead of trying to rebuild it, she's gaslighting and trying to manipulate you into being ok with her continued cheating. \n\nSometimes people aren't sexually compatible. However I stead of going out and finding something on the side, she should have sat you down and expressed her needs to you and then working together, finding ways to satisfy you both. That's how a healthy relationship works. \n\nI'm so sorry OP. The relationship is dead, and I think, deep down, you know it.", "NTA. Sounds like she wants to explore other options but is afraid she won't find someone to commit to her so she's staying with you as a safety net. \n\nIt doesn't matter what she thinks. You have to go with what you feel and what is right for you in a relationship.", "Nta. \nThe way I see it, you have 2 options. \n1. Break up, she won't ever stop cheating. And there might come a time that if you get married, she will get pregnant with her lovers child and lie about it, forcing you to raise and be financially responsible for said child.\n2. Don't break up and tell her that if she gets to have sex with other men then you will have sex with other women. If she gets mad, call her a hypocrite. If she can, then you can.\n\n However if she agrees and says nothing, revert back to option 1, break up, cause she is probably only with you because you are stable.

The \"does not want to look for other partners due to a lack of energy for that endeavor\" is a huge Red Flag. \n\nShe lied to you, she invalidate your feelings and wants to continue.

You want different things. If she doesn't want to be in a monogamous relationship, she shouldn't expect her partner to just be okay with that. She needs to find someone that feels similarly to her, and she isn't treating you fairly. The initial lying about it is also a big red flag.

WTF is wrong with your head? of course sex is a major part of a relationship as well. just ask her if she is ok with you sleeping around with other girls and watch her response. \n\ndude, dont let her gaslight you into believing anything else. she was cheating on you and when she got caught, she is making up whatever she wanted. You aren't being unreasonable. its not unreasonable to expect your partner to be loyal towards you. and if they arent willing to reciprocate the same, you have the choice to walk away. \n\nwalk away from this relationship before you are more emotionally damaged.", "ESH\n\nThat said, it's like a 99%/1% split, with her having the big portion.\n\nShe wants to cheat and also have a relationship. Negative. That dog don't hunt. \n\nAs always, whenever words like \"let\", \"allow\", or \"permit\" enter your phrasing about another adult person with agency and freewill, you are trending into asshole territory. You don't get to tell her what to do. She's not your possession. She will do what she wants to do. And what she wants to do is cheat on you regularly and not suffer consequences for it.\n\nYou do get to choose what ***you*** do about the situation. I hope you have enough self-respect to leave her.

If she still wants to fool around with this other dude regardless, then i would say this relationship has no future.", "NTA. It's not an open relationship if you didn't know about it.", "She cheated on you and disrespected you as a man.

Let her go, she's not worth it.", "NTA. but... it isn't about you 'letting' her do anything. It's whether or not you'll accept it. The plan B shows that she is having unprotected sex. She lied and is accepting a risk. That person is most likely not abstaining from other unprotected sex while not with her. She is also likely understating how often it happens and you do not know what she tells him about your relationship. She has disrespected you and he has no respect for your relationship. She is enjoying being dominated by him, but are you enjoying he>her>you? If not, you should end it and then she can do what she pleases and you can find someone more compatible with you. How would she feel if you developed a stronger relationship with someone else while claiming that a fundamental of your relationship is strong? If you feel that something like this isn't as important and your needs are being met, then maybe its acceptable to you. Perhaps you can investigate a poly lifestyle where you both are free to explore aspects with other people.

Here\u2019s the thing about ethical non monogamy, it can\u2019t be a solution to a problem someone else created. She is essentially cheating because she didn\u2019t get your consent to begin with. It\u2019s totally cool if you two decide to go down this path together, but she had to know she did this completely wind and owes you an apology. \nIf you\u2019re going to do this, you both need to establish ground rules and boundaries. This isn\u2019t ok at all, but it can be salvaged if you choose to. It can also become a tremendous opportunity for you both. I\u2019ve just started the ENM lifestyle and I\u2019m taking my time.

I dont let her use any of my money and asked for my money which she owes me as a first step of breakup.", "Yeah I agree. Although she says that she have only had sex once but the way she is explaining I think she could have cheated multiple times as well.\nI am going to breakup since there is no trust.

I think that if the guy she wants to fuck semi-annually, steps up and provide some of the things you provide for her, she would leave you in a ASAP. But like people are saying, only you know your relationship more than us", "Thanks. How long was your relation with the ex? Do you have trust issues with the new girl now?", "Yeah I agree. If that guy steps up she will leave me. I have to breakup and leave. I know that but I also do not want to lose her. But I also can not live with her now.
