That's just nasty, like not properly wiping your butt after taking a shit. Show some respect for the people around you, and practice some basic information hygiene. It's not the porn or the masturbation that's the problem. It's you being indiscreet and disrespectful.", "why are you masturbating to randos if you have a hot girlfriend???", "NAH. you guys need to communicate. you masturbating isn\u2019t wrong, but she\u2019s allowed to feel uncomfortable about what you\u2019re looking at while doing it. you need to communicate on boundaries for that. and ask yourself, would you feel uncomfortable if you saw what she was getting off to? try to look at it from her point of view. talk to her, set things straight.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an asshole here, but I do think you both could communicate better and you should apologize.\n\nEvery person has a different view of what\u2019s \u201ccheating\u201d in their mind. For some people, this would be an absolute no for them. I would apologize to her and have a conversation for both of you about where the boundary is for you as a pair. If she\u2019s feeling insecure, she may just need reassurance of how you feel about her. Maybe she\u2019d prefer you did that to pictures of her instead. At the end of the day I think it\u2019s worth hashing out, but since you didn\u2019t know her boundary I think it\u2019s reasonable to say it\u2019s a mistake as long as moving forward you plan to be conscious of how she\u2019s feeling.", "NAH. I do however hope you know that most instagram model aesthetics are completely unobtainable in real life. This is where your GF\u2019s insecurity is so understandable. In real life she can never look like what you like to masturbate to.  She can never be airbrushed, with all her \u201cflaws\u201d removed, her waist made to look a bit smaller, and cellulite brushed out, perfectly posed etc. So if/when you ever start expecting that in your thoughts or comparing her to that you need a reality check. Your viewing habits can and will change what your brain finds sexually appealing. It can absolutely hurt to hear that your significant other has a different preference to masturbate to.", "NAH.\n\nYou need to communicate your boundaries with each other.\n\nINFO: If she appeared annoyed at you looking at another woman that way, has it happened before? Has she caught you jerking it to a model before? Do you make comments about other women? Has she ever expressed that she doesn't like you looking at models, is that why you were guilty?\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to know what each other considers inappropriate moving forwards. I personally could give less of a shit if my partner jerks it to anybody and I could care less if I saw it on his phone thereafter, but maybe she does; You can't read her mind.", "I was going to go with N A H, but I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. \n\n1. Every relationship is different and different people have different boundaries. Both of you should have talked about what your expectations are for porn. Some people feel that watching porn is cheating and that\u2019s ok. Some people feel that watching porn is just fine. Some people even think that sex with others is ok. It\u2019s up to you both to decide together what your boundaries are when it comes to porn and then either respect those boundaries or break up and find someone more compatible. \n\n2. The part for me where you are the asshole is that you realize that it is probably hurtful for her to have to see what you are masturbating and instead of trying to comfort her, support her, empathize with her, re-affirm her, or help her to feel better, you did nothing but come here asking us if you are the asshole. You needlessly turned this into a \u2018who is right\u2019 situation instead of helping your gf through the situation.", "INFO: Has she expressed her feelings on you masturbating to other women in the past? Have you two had a conversation about this?", "NAH\nYou both have different expectations. Best to have a discussion.\nWould you be ok with her looking at nearly naked ripped guys? If so then that's fine, as long as it's not double standards", "NAH. You didn\u2019t know this was an issue for her and she\u2019s allowed to be uncomfortable by it. For me I\u2019m the same as her, i don\u2019t like it either, while some women wouldn\u2019t care.

Our life is great, our sex life is great, especially lately. I was teaching her how to change her oil and we were having fun until I opened the browser on my phone to check how many litres of oil her car takes. An attractive woman in a bikini popped up on the screen. (The day before I had used my phone to masturbate in the shower to an Instagram model\u2019s bikini pics.) I laughed nervously and exited the window. She pressed me about what it was. I was honest and said it was a model in a bikini. She sighed and shook her head and went into the house, got the dog and went for a walk, leaving me to finish changing her oil. When she got back she asked if her car was ready and drove off to run some errands. She returned and still hasn\u2019t spoken to me. I understand it\u2019s probably not a great feeling. She is a very beautiful woman and I\u2019m very attracted to her, but she\u2019s also very insecure, and so I try my best to be sensitive about that. This was an accident. But what I\u2019m I supposed to do? I don\u2019t like feeling ashamed of occasionally masturbating, but I also don\u2019t want her to feel bad.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

One with a partner and a young child?\n\nBecause it's nice, fun, natural and even if you have a great sex life you don't automatically stop finding other people attractive nor do you have to have the same sex drive as your partner. It's masturbation, he's not pumping another woman.\n\nI really don't understand why people are so thingy about what's going on in someone's head while touching their own genitals. It's not like you sign a contract to never ever think about other people when doing the selfdirty. It's okay to get hungry outside and eat at home. Especially with people that are virtually unreachable. Never had a celeb crush while being in a relationship?", "Because it\u2019s natural, and there is nothing wrong with it?", "Agreed.

Bro please don\u2019t apologize for that. You could in theory apologize for making her upset or whatever but I mean apologizing for doing it is prob not a good idea.

He can find anyone attractive lol.", "Listen as far as I\u2019m concerned my partner can fuck other people and I don\u2019t care. My point is the line is different for everyone. It\u2019s very very common for people to think that porn or masturbating to other people is cheating. Does that signify a broader insecurity that maybe they could get help with from a therapist? Maybe so, maybe not. They could have specific things from their past that despite working through are still triggered by the actions of their partner. \n\nEither way, it\u2019s a conversation you have when you get into a relationship so that you either know you\u2019re on the same page or can find a compromise.
