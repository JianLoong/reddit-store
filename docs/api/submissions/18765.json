{"id": 18765, "submission_id": "13y3mpm", "title": "AITA for \"ruining\" a marriage?", "selftext": "My (30F) cousin (33M, we\u2019ll call D) has been with his wife (30F, we\u2019ll call C) for 12 years (married for 8). They have 3 kids (oldest is 7).\n\nWhen C originally got with my cousin he seemed like a different person. He was considerate, supportive, and generally a nice person/boyfriend. As for C, she has always been awesome and our whole family loves her.\n\nWell, after they had their first child together it seemed like all of his old habits came back and was pretty much the guy we knew all of our lives. As the years went on C just kind of dealt with it. She did all of the housework, made all the meals, watched their kid(a) 24/7, and still did nice stuff for him. She took on a lot from him including berating her (ex: her weight gain, no one would ever want her, etc.). When C was a SAHM he'd say they didn\u2019t have money but he would turn around and drop hundreds buying himself something because \u201che worked hard for it\u201d. He always blamed her for their money problems because she didn\u2019t work but when she would offer to work he would blame her for not thinking about their kid. Over the years he\u2019s also shown shady behavior sending flirty messages/comments to women on social media and making secret social media accounts. He always gaslit her into thinking she was \u201dpsycho\u201d and that the real problem was she didn\u2019t trust him. I could go on forever, but basically the last year their relationship has been super rocky. His rude comments to her has gotten worse and he's been more short tempered with C and his children.\n\nC works full time now and D has been unemployed for the past 8 months. C has tried to be understanding but got fed up when D told her that his life is miserable because of her. I think something just snapped and C decided to file for divorce.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole, C came to me for advice I basically said C should get a divorce unless this is what she really wants for the rest of her life because after 7 years he hasn\u2019t changed and probably wont. D thinks since I\u2019m his cousin I\u2019m supposed to be on his side and back him up no matter what. I don't think I'm the asshole because I told him that family or not, nobody deserves to go through what C has gone through with him.\n\nPart of my family agrees with me because we all love C and knew that she didn\u2019t deserve what D put her through. A few family members (D included obviously) thinks that I\u2019m the asshole because I basically \u201cruined\u201d a marriage and tore a family apart. So AITA that \u201cruined\u201d a marriage and tore a family apart?\n\nEdit:\n\n1. This is not the first time I (or others) have given C advice when she came seeking it. We let her know that she had many options (including leaving if she wanted to) & we would support her. She stayed in the marriage of her own will. You can only help someone who actually wants it. But the older generation is very much the \u201cfamily over everything\u201d type.\n\n2. I\u2019ve called D out many times (I\u2019m not exactly his favorite) on his actions when it happened in front of me. Other family members have as well including his own mom. What I\u2019m not gonna do l is call him out on things his wife confides to me in confidence and get her in trouble, especially when she decides to stay with him. Only exception is if it put her or the children\u2019s lives in danger which to the best of my knowledge it hasn\u2019t.\n\n3. C grew up in a family that taught her this is what strong women and good wives do. They are \u201cunderstanding\u201d and \u201cendure\u201d to make their marriage work and keep the family together. Hence why it took years for her to decide to leave.", "created_utc": 1685682475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13y3mpm/aita_for_ruining_a_marriage/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The foundation is important.\n\nYou have simply expressed your opinion based on your own values. You are only one of many people and choices competing for C's judgment. Ultimately C made her own choice of values based on their meaning to her. If it's so important to other family members for her to stay married, they can tell her themselves, and see if they \"save\" the marriage. They won't. (The reason they won't is because D is not accepting responsibility and is blaming you instead.)\n\nPersonally I think divorce is a necessary option and right to support strong marriages.", "NTA\n\nD ruined his  own marriage through his appalling behaviour.

Your cousin is a jerk, and doesn't get unconditional support when he doesn't do anything to deserve it. Your advice didn't ruin their marriage, it just helped to validate what his wife already knew. The family members who don't see that either don't understand that, or more likely, don't want to understand that. And even if they want to invoke family over everything, there are three kids who are also family and they deserve to grow up in a home that isn't broken.", "NTA. You\u2019re being gaslit. You had no role whatsoever in ruining this marriage.", "NTA. If doing the right thing means going against your family, still do the right thing.
