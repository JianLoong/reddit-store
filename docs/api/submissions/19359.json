However, as I was calling him out, our mutual friends began to criticize me and tell me that I was being overly dramatic because all he did was publish a story and it had no negative effects. Nevertheless, I had already warned him not to upload the story. Even then, I kept hearing from everyone that I was being a jerk and should apologize.

He\u2019s using you to earn money and essentially treating you as his work slave. He\u2019s scamming you out in money.

He\u2019s also stealing your money. He\u2019s scaling you and his clients. There are some that can give free legal advice and some are no-win no fee. Legal charities can do  that or something like legal aid. You may have to have a parent or guardian for this due to your age (unsure as I don\u2019t live in your country). \n\nHave you have things in setting for this ? May or may not be contracts. So things like messages and texts or emails. Keep a record of it and have multiple copies of it for the lawyer. \n\n\nAlso go and find a legitimate freelancing agency. They might take a cut of your work as commission but it\u2019s much better than going through him. Other than that, do your own work with getting clients.

You can even do it to homes too. You just need to print them off your printer and walk and post it. You might need a bag for it. Google even has a free course on advertising.
