We were friends years ago but i haven\u2019t seen her since she had her kids. We aren\u2019t super close anymore, but I think she has just become so entitled since having kids and she has a full time nanny.", "I don\u2019t even know what child proofing means haha.

Also anything really heavy that could be easily pulled down and onto the child should be secured.  And yeah, anything important and fragile should be moved out of the reach of the children.  \n\nBut, asking someone to change your children's diapers is way out of line.  I can't remember ever hearing anyone do that.  Same thing with changing the wedding to match her kid's nap times.

Stand strong on your boundaries and never get left alone with the kids! She might sneak out of the door!", "Wow asking to change wedding plans for nap time!? Plus all the other stuff, I'd pull that invite back asap", "NTA.  You need to tell her this in a polite way.  You're here visiting, but I'm not a babysitter & I have work that I absolutely cannot take time off of to watch your kids.   Asking you to take time off & expecting you to be a babysitter is entitled behavior.  And asking to change some times for the wdding festivities is def entitled.", "NTA but she asked to stay thinking she'd get the weekend free and dump them on you.", "NTA - She is staying at your house because your house is free and it comes with you, a person she thinks she can pressure into nannying. She knows a hotel wouldn't have that option and it would cost a lot of money. It was already gracious of you to open your own to young children, stand your ground on the PTO and diaper front.", "NTA she definitely planned on you being a sitter while she enjoys the wedding weekend. Make sure she has a sitter lined up for the actual wedding. If she's not there yet, tell her she needs to find other accommodations you are no longer able to have her stay", "NTA, but beware, if you have anything break that you value, move it out of sight where the kids can\u2019t get to it.  Toddlers are into everything and constantly going.  You need to use plain language and state that you will not be babysitting, so if she needs a babysitter, she needs to hire one.  Also tell her that while you may have time to watch the kids while she showers, that will be the extent of the child care you will be providing, no diaper changes, etc.", "NTA. Rescind the invite ASAP so she can book other accommodations. This will result in nothing but bad feelings and your husband shouldn\u2019t be subjected to her nonsense at all.", "NTA, the world does not revolve around this person.", "NTA.

So idk", "I told her I could ask around for a baby sitter and she said she likes to keep the kids with her since the baby is still nursing.. so whatev! I tried.", "Yea it\u2019s a long story. I didn\u2019t realize she was bringing her kids when I told her she could stay. Over the past couple weeks she keeps making more and more demands that wasn\u2019t originally mentioned. 4 years ago, she offered her house to me and my husband while we were in her neck of the woods so I thought I would be polite and repay the favor. Didn\u2019t realize it would turn into what it is. I also haven\u2019t seen her since she had both her kids so idk she didn\u2019t use to be like this.", "I agree. This already sounds like a disaster. Your house will probably be damaged because it\u2019s not child proof and she clearly can\u2019t look after two kids on her own if she\u2019s expecting you to take time of work (WTF?!) to help her with them. Her requests to change wedding activities around her kids nap time is just outrageous, will she be embarrassingly demanding at the wedding? \n\nWhy is she travelling alone with two kids if she can\u2019t handle them?

So why suffer all that discomfort, just put the kibosh now. Friendship ends up in same place but you don't have to be uncomfortable in your own home.", "Well...Don't know about \"beautiful\" but......Above average? 8)", "Given your other comments, why are you so hell bent on accommodating her in your house? What is at stake here? \nIf you are uncomfortable, state it out loud to her. Draw the boundaries, tell her it's your house and you make the rules. The kids can literally wreck havoc if they are of havoc wrecking nature. And since the friend seems fo entitled to care about your boundaries, I don't think losing her is an actual loss. Neither to her, nor to you.", "Is she flying in to spend time with you?  Was this talked about between the two of you\n\nIs the husband staying for extra time she is spending or does this friend think of this as a girls get together?", "Yea she needs to find somewhere else to stay", "\"Hi friend, it seems like we have a fundamental difference in expectations about your trip here. I was happy to offer you a free place to stay but beyond that you'd really be on your own. While we are happy to spend some time together and share a meal or two, my husband and I aren't able to make changes to our schedule or cover childcare in any way.

She sounds like just the type of person to do that.", "Nannies are not required to go on trips with their work families. We have lives of our own.
