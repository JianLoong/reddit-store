She's asking for far too much at this point. Honestly, and this is just me, I'd revoke the offer to stay at your house if she insists on having you take time from work to be a nanny in your own home.", "NTA. She\u2019s acting like an entitled asshole who was never taught manners.", "Why can't people understand that just because \\*they\\* choose to have kids, we don't have to give a shit about them? Take care of your own damn kids!

But to be clear about other things you mentioned, just so there is no misunderstanding..... I am not a nanny and I'm not doing diapers. If that's gonna be a problem for you, well, now you know and you can seek other arrangements. My schedule in regards to the events and my own personal life outside the events are not subject to negotiation. You may ask something that we haven't already covered, but the pre-condition before you ask me a favor is understanding that \"No\" is one of the possible answers and it may not come with an explanation. If that isn't going to work for you, then don't be asking me for shit.", "NTA.\n\nif anything, your friend sounds like she thinks the world revolves around her. having the wedding festivities moved to suit HER own needs is very entitled. no offense to her. \n\nand just flat out expecting you to take care of her kids? you never agreed to that, nor do you have to.", "NTA. No, No and No. practice this.", "NTA, how entitled can one person be asking the wedding couple to change wedding plans. Just say NO!", "NTA. \nIt sounds like she needs clear boundaries set if she is going to stay with you. I have kids, and would never go to someone\u2019s house as a guest and ask them to change diapers/ask them to be the nanny. She is way over-stepping and if she can\u2019t take a NO she needs to find other accommodations.", "NTA like you said you are not a free babysitter!", "Nta. This is why I\u2019m always \u201cbusy\u201d if my friends or family with kids want to come over. I\u2019m not a free babysitter and my husband and I chose to not have kids for a reason so stop pushing them onto us.", "NTA - You're friend is way too entitled. I would be honest with her and if she doesn't want to stay because of that then that's on her. Like hey you're welcome to stay but I won't be around much and even when I am, I'm not a baby person which is you know why I don't have any of my own, so I won't be helping do anything for them.", "Nta  just set the expectations ahead of time\n\n\nYour more then welcome to stay here but I have a busy life so don't expect help cleaning up after them rct", "uhh, wow. no. NTA. and if i were you, i'd be sure to be gone any time she plans to be gone, so she can't try to rope you into watching her kids, *especially* during the wedding itself. \n\nyou're doing her a huge favor by letting her bring her kids to stay at your place for free, i cannot believe she has the audacity to ask for anything else.", "NTA\n\nWhy is this even on AITA? All of us, including you, know that you are very clearly not the AH.\n\nTell this person that you only offered a place for them to stay. Not to be a personal nanny. If they don't like it, they can find somewhere else to stay.", "NTA\n\n>She also asked the bride and groom to change some of their wedding festivity times to accommodate her kid\u2019s nap times\n\nIf you want to call her out for her entitlement, everyone will have your back", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To ask to change some things at the wedding is  crazy, she needs a babysitter or dont go.", "Does your friend have a partner?\n\nIf yes, why aren't they coming to the wedding?\n\nIf your friend is a single mom, she is looking for a bit of a break from two small children.  Yes, she expects you to help.  Is it fair?  No.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nObviously she chose to stay with you expecting you to babysit her kids for free.\n\nMaybe you should tell her what you charge for providing childcare services. It should be substantial.", "NTA. This is another mother that thinks she is more important than others because she is a mother, and she is obviously not.", "NTA, don't let her stay with you at all.  She's likely to just take off and ditch them with you.  Revoke the invitation.", "NTA. Don't change any diapers.", "NTA, if they aren't your children and therefore aren't your problem. Your friend may very well want a holiday from their children and get more help but that's something that if you offered would be fine to demand it is entitlement.", "NTA.\n\nI ld be setting very clear boundaries like 2 feet from your garden fence and have her stay elsewhere. \nOtherwise your defiantly finding broken items thanks to. Toddler,  broken sleep thanks to baby. And her saying I'm just gonna go grab x item and suddenly your babysitting two. Kids and can't get hold of her.\n\nYour under no obligation to change anyones kid, help anyone with those kids or buy toys to entertain them either.\n\nAnd while we're at it who the actual fuck asks a couple to work round a random persons kids...

My husband wants to do this. Her demands keep getting worse.", "I know it's your house, but I would be \"out\" as much as possible.", "I\u2019m honestly just shocked. She also asked me what kids toys I had at my house when she knows I don\u2019t even have kids.", "Yea\u2026 she was like \u201cit\u2019s so hard to entertain a toddler\u201d lol\u2026 like that isn\u2019t my problem! My parents just put me in front of the TV. I turned out fine ! Haha", "Yea true. I need to set expectations early on.", "Your under no obligation to change anyones kid, help anyone with those kids or buy toys to entertain them either.", "I know kids are tough, and I\u2019m not trying to be a complete jerk by not helping at all.. but she is coming to stay with me to attend a wedding. It\u2019s not like she is coming to visit me. If I invited her and her kids her to come visit, I can see where there may be more of an expectation for me to Interact with the kids but that\u2019s not the case here.", "Make sure she doesn't skip out to the evening wedding festivities and leave her kids with you.", "Her husband is flying in the morning of the wedding. She is coming in a day earlier", "I didn\u2019t invite them. She texted me asking if she could stay at my house while traveling to my city for a wedding. I said she can use my upstairs.", "Sounds like you have enough to go back to her and tell her she has expectations that can\u2019t be met/misunderstanding of the invitation to stay with you, so because you can\u2019t do what she needs, she can\u2019t stay with you .  You will probably lose this friend, but sounds like good riddance.", "She asked what kind of toys you have? \\*snicker\\*", "That\u2019s just ridiculous. This person doesn\u2019t sound like a very good friend. I would never act this way towards anyone, much less someone I cared about.", "LoL! Entertain? They used to stick me in a crib, with a piece of plywood on top and a cinder block on top of that! I would get out and wreak havoc! Till I discovered dinosaurs....then it was all books!", "Agreed. \nShe is already staying with you, I don\u2019t see why she thinks it\u2019s okay for her to keep asking/expecting of you. \nSometimes it\u2019s okay to be a jerk, you need to be comfortable in your own home!", "I would make sure she doesn\u2019t  think you will be watching the kids so she can have fun for the ceremony", "So she invited herself and you acquiesced.  You're hosting a family with young children, it's your responsibility to child proof the place.", "Yes! I told her I have tons of dog toys !!!", "Yea. We were friends years ago but i haven\u2019t seen her since she had her kids. We aren\u2019t super close anymore, but I think she has just become so entitled since having kids and she has a full time nanny.", "I don\u2019t even know what child proofing means haha. Like no breakable stuff? I don\u2019t have any breakable things within a kids reach", "Good response but I was thinking more of \"adult\" toys. Because I am bad.", "This is such a cute, innocent and wholesome reply. You're adorable op!", "my mom pulls out the plastic food storage containers when great grandkids come over.", "Well her full time nanny is NOT  you, so might want to yank that invite.", "If she had a full time nanny, why isn't the nanny watching the kids?", "Oh, it's mostly just covering all the unused electrical outlets with plugs.  Also anything really heavy that could be easily pulled down and onto the child should be secured.  And yeah, anything important and fragile should be moved out of the reach of the children.  \n\nBut, asking someone to change your children's diapers is way out of line.  I can't remember ever hearing anyone do that.  Same thing with changing the wedding to match her kid's nap times.  I bet the bride and groom is going to wish they had a child free wedding.\n\nupdate:  in case you want to see what the full blown childproof experience involves:  https://www.pampers.com/en-us/baby/parenting-life/article/baby-proofing-your-home", "I remember my 5yr soon coming home and all excited to tell us his friend's mum had a big plastic willy under her bed!\n\nSo we did our best to change the subject to something more fun so it didn't become a thing and was forgotten by him soon after.\n\nWe never mentioned it again, though I do wonder if I should have let her know her hiding place wasn't good enough...", "She is bringing her kids for whatever reason and the nanny isn\u2019t coming", "That seems to defeat the purpose of having a nanny!  Stand strong on your boundaries and never get left alone with the kids! She might sneak out of the door!"]}
