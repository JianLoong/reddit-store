I didn\u2019t realize she was bringing her kids when I told her she could stay.

Buying electric outlet covers, baby gates etc does.", "I've never had a nanny and I don't really know how that works, it just seems like if there was ever a time to stretch the budget and ask if the nanny could come along, this would be it. Or perhaps the dad could keep them at home and have the nanny work her regular schedule to tend to the kids until mom gets home.", "NTA, You need to have a very honest talk with her.  There is no doubt that she is planning on leaving the kids with you during the wedding. Let her know that your plans have changed, and you can no longer host her.  You said your house is not toddler proof.  This is a danger to this child and she can turn around and sue you.  Find a cheap Airbnb where she can go stay, send her the link. With her attitude there is no real  friendship to ruin.", "NTA...Just so NTA.   \n\n\nYou and husband come up with a \"family issue\" quickly and be unavailable that weekend!!!", "If you don\u2019t rescind the offer, send her the name of some babysitters and give her the numbers. There are always random kids willing to babysit in the neighborhood. Post on nextdoor or fb and someone will give you some info.", "NTA, you even said your house isn\u2019t child safe, but she\u2019s rather a free place to crash than have her kids be safe? Wild.", "NTA!!! Friend needs to make other arrangements. Being a mom entitles you to basically having to be the parent and take care of your own kids, you might miss out on somethings, you don't get a free babysitter just because you think it should happen that way", "NTA As a childless uncle, and great-uncle, I have never changed a diaper, nor have I ever been asked to. Even my FAMILY never asked this of me. To do it for someone not even related to you? I don't think so.", "NTA. We don\u2019t have kids because we don\u2019t want to deal with the realities of having kids. We\u2019ve had friends with kids try and overstep these boundaries like this before and learned a long time ago you just have to be firm about this. She will not \u201cget better\u201d, only worse. \n\nIts not your problem. Time to revoke the invitation.", "NTA- People need to bear in mind that they had kids to glorify their own egos or desires, and they have done no one else any favours in doing so. Assuming you did not father these kids you have no obligation here.", "NTA.  Someone should have uninvited her to the wedding when she started demanding they change event times to accommodate her kid's naptime!  If it isn't too late, rescind your invitation.", "NTA there is a bunch of red flags. You never agreed to help with kids you agreed to give her your extra room for a couple of days. I know kids are hard to deal with but honestly if she had to ask someone else to take off work to help with the kids then maybe she shouldn\u2019t go to the wedding. ALSO not sure what she is to the bride and groom but she 100% should not be asking them to move wedding activities around for kids naps. The kids either don\u2019t need to come or she needs to just not come because she\u2019s expecting all of y\u2019all to accommodate her and her kids and that\u2019s just not respectful.", "NTA. Rescind on the grounds that when you consented to have her stay with you, you were under the impression she would be coming alone and did not expect free childcare from you.", "As the dad of two little girls, no, you aren't required to change a diaper or do ANYTHING you don't want to do with your 'friends' babies.  I never asked anyone to change a diaper unless they were babysitting of course.  NTAH here...", "NTA and if I was you I\u2019d rescind my offer to stay. You can already tell the weekend is gonna be a problem.", "NTA", "Nta.  Are your sure she is going to leave. She sounds like she is hunkering down.", "Rude rude rude! NTA! \n\nSorry this is irrelevant but I am so curious on how she brought it up that she wanted you to take care of her kids.. with what words??", "Listen to your husband. If the situation was reversed, you would livid with him. \nESH", "You need to value your husband over your friend here.", "Why is your husband so insistent on this person staying there especially after they're causing nothing but problems before they even arrive? Are they family? Does your husband not understand that he's letting someone mistreat you with their expectations and is doing nothing about it to help you? Tell hubby that he can take time off and he can change diapers", "Stolen comment from u/PensionLegitimate706  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1524kqp/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_friend_with_their/jsbyh4q?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2). Bad bot.", "Rescind the offer. Oops, sorry! Something came up. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Next level entitlement indeed. However it was quickly surpassed by the friend asking the bride and groom to accommodate her kids\u2019 nap schedules. Friend is the mayor of Entitlement Island. \n\n\nOP please tell us how that went over?", "Bride and groom aren\u2019t changing anything. I told my friend that I would happily ask around my work for baby sitters so that she could go enjoy the wedding without her kids and she said she wants to take the kids with her lol.. so whatev. She said it\u2019s good for children to go to adult events so they learn..and so people can spend time with her kids. Why does everyone with kids think everyone else wants to constantly be around them? I have many friends with kids and I like being around their kids in moderation (example: going to their kids bday party or going trick or treating with them) but as much as I love some of my friends kids, I don\u2019t want to be around them all the time !", "Take my poor person upvote \u2b50\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f", "News flash to these types of parents\u2026.the kids don\u2019t want to be their (especially at those ages)! Perhaps she will ask the bride and groom what toys they will have there. \n\n\nI\u2019m lucky to be in a friend group that understands it\u2019s only fun for the kids (and ourselves) to take the kids to kid friendly stuff. Snow tubing - kids. Birthday party at a restaurant - no kids. \n\n\nTaking your kids to an event and expecting other people to WANT to watch/care for them  - delusional! \n\n\nYour friend seriously needs to think about her toddler. Who thinks a 2 year old wants to sit through a wedding, formal dinner, then a party with loud music. I can\u2019t imagine a whole venue being childproof. \n\n\nYour friend will be telling them to turn down the music. Push the glasses and knives towards the center of the tables. Oh and cut the cake early. Junior wants a piece now."]}
