Being supportive is making sure he has no impediment from you to carrying out his hobbies, not being part of them. \n\nAlso, hyper focus like you describe is something I am acutely aware of and can suggest neurodivergence. In may case adult diagnosis of autism /adhd. It may not be - but worth thinking about - for me it helped me understand my hyper focus and also start to see my \u2018current focus\u2019 from the perspective of others.", ">We looked up a cool clown school and found one that gives classes for adults but for me that was as far as I could go.\n\nGirl, that is about 200% more effort than I would have been able to muster.

Maybe an aesthetic. He\u2019s a clown in two ways if he\u2019s upset you\u2019re not into every hobby of his. It\u2019s probably a good thing for both of you to have things you do with/for just yourself as individuals.", "Is your partner neurodivergent? NTA, this is weird, giving you the benefit of the doubt that this is real.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner sounds so much like I was in my late 20s to early 30s. I would catch an interest in something like decorating cakes. I couldn't just buy a beginners set of decorating tips and one or two pans, I had to by a complete set of professional decorating tips and dozens of pans. After 6 months, I lost interest. Then, I got interested in cross stitching and had to have every color made, even if I had no plans of using it, again, I got tired of it in months. Same with photography and jewelry making, among others.\n\nAs it turns out, I am bipolar, and this is how it manifested itself in me. I can't say your partner is bipolar, but it might be helpful to have him evaluated by someone. After I got set on therapy and medication, I was able to control these urges to go all out on things like this. Instead, when I get the urge to splurge on a new hobby, I make a spreadsheet on what I would spend if I went all out, I spend hours researching it, and that satisfy the urge.", "How often does he develop these interests? How long do they last until he drops them?", "NAH just some excessive expectations on his part that are making him lose his perspective. You can express verbal support without participating in the class or listening to details the whole morning. Your husband's expectations are a bit much. When you did your master's degree, he didn't come to the classes with you, did he? Probably not.", "NTA. You did as much as anyone could reasonably expect. I agree with the other person who said this kind of hyper focus on special interests and lack of understanding why someone else isn\u2019t also interested might indicate neurodivergence. He may benefit from clear explanation of what can normally be expected from someone, but he may not accept that if he doesn\u2019t accept that his intensity is unusual.", "NAH\n\nYou don't always have to be involved in your partners interest's. Its one thing if you're never involved but needing a break from something you dont find interesting is normal. Him being upset by it is understandable if hes used to you being supportive, but he shouldn't be using the \"i did this for you, now you do this for me\". Its not a healthy thing to do and say in a relationship. Out of my expertise.", "NTA- \n\nAt all. Your partner is wonderfully passionate about things they enjoy. Good for them. \n\nBut you DO NOT need to engage in everything they enjoy to care about them. You helped them out. They get to do their thing and NO you don't have to literally watch clown school videos for hours. NO a hobby, while important, is not a long term necessary career step. If you attended grad school for kicks that would be one thing, but I'm guessing it was necessary for your career. \n\nYour partner can cool off and accept that your support and love doesn't mean doing everything they want with them. They want clown school. By all means. Don't mean you're enrolling.", "NTA but I am biased and straight terrified of clowns. You didn't poop on his obsession, it's just not yours. I gotta do this with my kids sometimes. \"I love you, I don't get it, but I'm glad you enjoy it. You're welcome to tell me all about it, but it probably won't stick since it's not my thing. You get to have a thing that's just for you.\"", "Good lord. I'm going to start answering \"why are you single?\" with \"so that I never get shit on for not pretending clown class is the equivalent of a masters degree.\" \n\nThis is ludicrous. It's nice that he has a hobby, but hobbies are typically things that adults do to occupy themselves. Expecting you to stop living your life to follow the potential adventures of an amateur clown as he googles clown school would be too much if he were 12. Surely, there is a Reddit thread or online support group for aspiring clowns who feel unsupported by society. Find it and send him there, secure in the knowledge that you are NTA. \n\nAlso, watch \"Baskets\" and start calling him a \"clune\"", "NTA", "You literally are supporting him, you just don\u2019t want to participate you are NOT REQUIRED to participate in his interests in order to support him. Y\u2019all need to have a conversation or show him this post because he is being ridiculous. NTA", "I fully expect to be downvoted, but YTA. One of the best things about my relationship is how much husband supports my crazy dreams. I just got an aerial silks rig and he watched a couple of videos with me and it felt nice. Maybe you could have just said \u201cI\u2019ll watch 2 but then I\u2019m going to watch something else.\u201d No one likes their interests being laughed at, it feels awful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
