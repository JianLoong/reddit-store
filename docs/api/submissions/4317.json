If they want you to keep doing it, then you need to set some boundaries.  A reference, and payment on the same day every week, or month, and an allowance for fuel if your doing there school runs.

Unless they are reciprocating in some way, the \"family\" line is nothing but an excuse to take advantage of you.\n\nAnd what Cleo did to you was despicable. Not content with just declining your request for a reference, she lied to you that she'd give you one, just so she could deliberately sabotage your application when the prospective employer called her.\n\nAnd there's something very wrong with your sister if she takes Cleo's side after that. No matter whether a person is \"family\", if they refuse to stop treating you like dirt, sometimes the best thing to do for your own wellbeing is cut them out of your life.", "NTA - the nerve of them both! They're using you to their own advantage whilst failing to pay you on time if that.", "NTA\n\nIf they ask, say you obviously can\u2019t be trusted to look after their children because Cleo wouldn\u2019t even give you a good reference!!!", "NTA. They're screwing you over to purely benefit themselves. Don't babysit ever again.", "NTA you good enough to look after her child, but she can\u2019t say anything good about you. Sounds like she want free labor", "NTA.\n\nLet\u2019s go Reddit. Can someone give OP a reference?", "NTA. Oh its obvious what type of **game** Cleo is playing. She is trying to sabotage you so you cannot get a job because then she will lose her underpaid baby sitter. She isn't your friend OP, don't baby sit for her ever again. This includes your sister since she obviously is in on the plan also.", "NTA\n\nThere's something else going on here. It sounds like Cleo didn't want to lose her child care, so she purposely sabotaged your attempt to seek employment. I for sure wouldn't babysit any longer for Cleo, and if your sisters kids are a package deal, it's a no-go at this point. \n\nIt's not really about Cleo owing you a good reference. It's about her agreeing to give you one then not doing so.", "NTA\n\nCleo just tried to Sabotage your chance to find a job soo that you'll alwayssss be free to babysit for her", "NTA. How selfish of her! Have someone else as your reference. Maybe someone who witnessed you with the kids or could speak to how organized or responsible you are.", "NTA\nShe absolutely did this so you could still watch her kids. She absolutely did this on purpose. \nI wouldn\u2019t be watching those kids anymore either. She said she would be your reference and then put your interview at serious risk.", "Nope, NTA. My guess Cleo and your sister have a plan to keep you as a cheap babysitter, and therefore sabotage your employment. Don't cave in.", "NTA, but I'm a little confused as to what's going on between your sister and you.\n\nAs far as Cleo goes, she lied to you and intentionally sabotaged your potential job. You owe her nothing (no notice, no polite words, nothing). She is 100% the AH here.\n\nIs you sister refusing to have you watch her children because you won't also watch Cleo's? If so, I guess she has that option, but she's the one causing the problem here.", "Another good point", "While a nice thought, no one actually knows OP and if harm came to a child due to a fake reference... Just no, bad idea.", "Yeah, Cleo is a terrible friend, and OP should never watch her kids again, not even for a second.", "I\u2019m refusing to babysit her children because she took Cleo\u2019s side, she won\u2019t let me see the children at all because I won\u2019t babysit", "NTA clearly.  \n\nLet's put it this way if I received a random call asking for a reference for a stranger I would still give it.\n\nTo not do it... and furthermore sabotage someone you're close to.  Is absolutely horrible.  If I were you, I'd remember this and anyone supporting it.  They ain't your people sadly.", "NTA. You don't have a contract with Cleo that stipulates you have to give her two weeks notice, do you? If you do, it should outline your compensation amounts and time frame, and she's responsible to pay you within it. But I doubt there is a contract. You have probably been working under the table, and being paid well less than what a professional service would charge. It sounds like Cleo is trying to tank your chances of getting employed elsewhere so you'll need to keep babysitting/be available when she needs you.
