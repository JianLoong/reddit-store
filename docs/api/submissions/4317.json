There\u2019s deli work, restaurants, bakeries, donut shops, etc. when you go to interview, dress nicely. Not Raggy jeans and tank tops. Look up \u201c applying for a job\u201d. You\u2019ll find some helpful suggestions. Any particular hobbies? Love make up? Sephora is the place.  I certainly wouldn\u2019t get on your case to keep babysitting. It might pay a few bills, but it\u2019s not a career, or a real job. An plus on your side is that you aren\u2019t a teenager. If you\u2019ve been handling kids for five years, think what a nice change it will be to work with adults. Start making lists of the type of places you might like to work at. Read up on how to approach a job interview. We aren\u2019t talking corporate offices at this stage, but something in general about doing a job interview. Keep in mind, you might get a job you end up hating. That happens. Sometimes it\u2019s the job, sometimes it\u2019s the people. Find another job. Good luck to you. You were conscientious about child care. One of the toughest jobs around. Don\u2019t give up. I have faith in you. Please give us an update when you land that job.", "Oh that is delicious.\n\nOP please do this.\n\nNTA", "And that said 21 year old has a year old baby she *needs* money for, and that that is non-negotiable.", "This right here, this is not a person who respects you at all. Cleo is an asshole", "Don\u2019t cave OP! It will only get worse if you do. Those kids will be fine without you and there will be opportunities to reconcile in the future.", "You should tell you sister to kiss your ass. She is a terrible sister and should be in support of your bettering your life for you and your child. \n\nI can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t yell at Cleo or halt the friendship for making you look bad at a potential employer. What a shady bitch, both of them. \n\nStand your ground. If you can\u2019t see your nieces  or nephew, don\u2019t show her that it bothers you. Be strong and tell her to go fuck herself and if she wants a sister, she has Cleo and go no contact on her. \n\nThey underpaid you for five years too long. They want to continue to take advantage of u bc it makes their lives easier. \n\nAnd tell your mom to go fuck herself too.", "Exactly, tell them the price is double and that they need to press all of the cash into your palm before their kids are even through the threshold", "NTA, she sabotaged you", "NTA. Wow. She sabotaged you getting a job so she could continue to use you and your sister backs her. And your sister is punishing her children to punish you. Everything about them is horrible.", "You are NTA. You have every right to stop your services when you choose. You have to look out for your own family. Especially since they sometimes didn't pay you or pay you on time. What are they expecting? Some people are so entitled.", "You are NTA. Your sister and Cleo are. Do not babysit for these people again. They took advantage of you. Neither woman treated you professionally, you do not need to consider they employed you. You were under no obligation to give notice to a \"job\" that was as unprofessional as they were. Cleo should not be used as a reference. In the nanny/childminding business, references work both ways. Word gets out, and if they treat others like they treated you they will have a hard time finding a replacement. No one good that will put up with their shenanigans anyway.\n\nYou didn't ask about this, but if you are still looking for employment, research on how to polish up a resume for someone who has not \"worked\" before. Community organizations, schools, heck, libraries have resources with solid advice. Find other more reliable people in your life who can act as a reference, religious leaders, teacher, etc. Its not impossible to get a good job without previous experience. If you are wanting to stick with the nanny/childminding business take some courses at a local school, get a certificate on first aid/CPR (Red Cross, YMCA etc.). This looks good on a resume and shows your professionalism.\n\nGood luck sweetie.", "I'm so sorry that your family sucks so much.  You are NTA.", "NTA I would never watch those children again.", "NTA. She\u2019s selfish and greedy.", "Nta.. if u need a reference let me know lol", "NTA Tell your sister and Cleo that they have no more free/low cost babysitting and get an actual friend to be a reference for you next time", "YTA, so without any notice you quit the \"job\" and you still expect glowing references? That's not how this works in the working world. If you're counting on a good reference you give sufficient notice to allow your employer to at least attempt to find your replacement before you bail.", "NTA she should have been paying you on time and properly. She didn't. She also paid you what sounds like well below industry standards then had a shocked pickachu face when you needed a different job that actually paid.", "NTA. They're trying to trap you for their own babysitting. They're not good people so don't even consider them to be reliable for any future needs.", "This is what happens when you allow people to take advantage of you.. so Cleo gave you a bad reference because you wanted to get a real job that pays decent money and stop babysitting for her what she was half a@# paying you or not paying you at all..\n\nAnd your trifling sister agreed with her. After what my sister pulled, and back Cleo..  I wouldn't give a dang about seeing her kids because that's messed up..", "NTA why on earth did she refuse to give a reference though", "Better to get screwed by people who have no relationship to you than friends and family", "Her mum has an obvious favorite daughter because this is outrageous. NTA for OP and I would consider charging them $40/hr for babysitting while I find another job\u2026upfront charges", "NTA. If someone treated my sister this way, I would make sure they never lived another happy day in their life.", "NTA- i thought cleo is legally required to provide the dates you worked for her? And i was also told my previous employer would only provide dates and answer the question \"would you hire this employee again?\" because any negative review could result in a lawsuit.", "So you're supposed to be their babysitter for the rest of your life? Sounds selfish and entitled and the only ones benefiting from this arrangement are them, not you. NTA", "NTA\n\nThey won\u2019t give you a reference or will only give a bad one bc they don\u2019t want to lose their free/ cheap babysitter . \n\nHint- no one investigates references. Ask a close friend of yours. I\u2019ve been placed down as references for friends when we were younger for housing/ jobs etc.", "NTA\n\nCleo didn\u2019t want to lose her babysitter so she tanked your reference and your sister supported and justified what Cleo did?  \nI\u2019d say they both lost a babysitter (backfired a bit on Cleo, didn\u2019t it?) and I wish you the best of luck finding a new job.  It didn\u2019t have to be that way but what Cleo did was really sleazy and self serving.  Seriously, best of luck to you!   You\u2019re right to look for something with better pay, benefits, etc\u2026.", "Omg NTA \nI must say though how dare you look for guaranteed paid employment without considering what they will do without their  \"oh its okay, she's my sister/friend - she won't mind not being paid this month (at all/on time) mate rates discount\" and no notice either how selfish !! when i bet they gave you at least two months' notice of none or late payment !!. /s \nLook after yourself OP they are not entitled to your time or care.", "NTA, Wow your sister is beyond ungrateful & disgusting, so is Cleo but she isn\u2019t your sister.\nThey don\u2019t deserve any kind of notice. And yes, your sister did do something wrong, she took Cleo\u2019s side when she should have reamed her a new one on your behalf.\nDefinitely look how another job and forget those 2.\nSince your mom is so concerned for them, then she can babysit.", "NTA! It sounds like Cleo is trying to sabotage your job search so you can keep minding her children part-time. That's messed up. You have yourself and your child to look after. She should sympathize. Their actions have consequences. Unfortunately, you setting up a boundary ended up having a negative consequence as well. All you can say is: \n\n*Taking care of your children is the \"only\" work experience I have on my resume at the moment. Therefore, rescinding the reference the moment someone called is the same as sabotaging the livelihood of me and my child.* \n\n*I am in dire need of stability and work since becoming a single mom. The flexible situation in which I took care of the kids is no longer an option, and the hours are not enough for me to look after a single-income household for 2.* \n\n*Therefore, keeping that in mind, it's no longer viable for me to continue to work in such unstable circumstances. I will uphold my boundary and hope that, if one day, you can understand my point of view, that I am not in the vulnerable place I am at this moment and maybe we can work towards reconciliation.* \n\nGood luck with your job search. Do not discount your work as someone who labored at home. You are great multi-tasker, planner, manager, mediator... the list goes on. There are places that value those qualities. From retail to maybe day-care, just apply and see what happens. If they ask for non-family references you can be honest and say: once I didn't have flexibility of not being a stay-at-home parent (emphasis on payment schedule and only being able to take on part time work - and by that I mean not being able to take any more work outside family and friend because it would interfere with their flexible schedule) no longer worked for them, they resented that fact. Or leave it out all together. Try ask without asking if your work is willing to be a reference (for reference companies like TJX state they won't be references). Also, you are young, so there will be some companies that just by looking at your age won't expect a full resume. Maybe see if a one page cover letter expanding on your experience is helpful for some jobs. If there is a hiring sign in the window, go in an inquire about it. They may refer you to a website (bigger chains will handle things electronically only, but with some smaller companies or franchises you may start building a relationship then and you may reference the fact that you've had informal work). \n\nGood luck, and hope you can have a conversation with your mom in which she can see your side of your situation.", "Yikes. \n\nNTA. They\u2019re trying to abuse you into staying into this situation.", "NTA. \nShe didn't just not give a reference, she agreed to give you one then declined when someone ask for one. \nWhich, as you said, is the same as a bad reference. \nThis is not something acceptable from a friend or a family member. \nI wouldn't help them, even payd. \nGood luck on your job hunt.", "I agree. NTA.", "I would also recommend OP raise her rates and require payment upfront (at the very least make it clear when payment is due and that all services will be stopped and civil charges filed if payment is not paid at the agreed upon time) if she plans to babysit for them again.", "OP stated in the post that she has never had a *serious* job outside of childminding, so it\u2019s safe to assume she has worked other jobs before, such as part-time retail/food service.\n\nCleo would know that because, as OP said, Cleo and sister have been friends since childhood and OP has known Cleo for her entire life.\n\nbut the biggest problem is that **Cleo told OP that she would be a reference, then refused to be a reference when she was called.**\n\nthat piece of information on its own is e go ugh to judge this post as NTA. regardless of the reason Cleo had for refusing to be a reference, she shouldn\u2019t have said yes and then refused; she\u2019s a grown woman who decided to screw OP instead of being honest and telling OP no.\n\nagain, that\u2019s enough information to judge this post as NTA. the actual, obvious reason Cleo had for saying yes and then refusing just makes her a bigger AH (along with sister and OP\u2019s mom).", "Oh good point.... OP does your mom always favor your sister?", "NTA\n\nThey tried to exploit you.", "Technically NTA but you should have given them two weeks or more to find alternate baby sitting. Sisters friend was not cool to not give a reference for you, I\u2019m sure it cost you the job.", "NTA, won\u2019t give you a reference but still wants you to help with her kids.\n\nYou can do a lot better than that bullshit. And your sister can eat shit, who does that.", "NTA. They are sabotaging you for your childcare services. I imagine they will not be able to find childcare that they only pay when they feel like paying and it\u2019s usually late if at all the way they have done with you. \n\nIf you have friends just put down a friend\u2019s number and have them pretend to be someone you work for or nanny for. I\u2019ve lost count how many times I\u2019ve lied and said I used to manage or work with my friends (side note- don\u2019t do this if you\u2019re applying for a federal govt job. Any other job is fair game though).", "NTA cut them (sis and cleo) off and if you can afford it (meaning your mom is not part of your support system) go no contact with your mom too, at least temporarily until you sort yourself out. Otherwise she'll undermine your efforts, mine your confidence and make you feel guilty. You need to be away from that influence to move forward successfully. As for your sis and co, of course NTA, they are trying to keep you from finding a job to suit their needs, that is exploitation and you can bet your ass that once they no longer need you they'll drop you quicker than a hot potato. Proof of that is that they are late to pay you, they clearly put their needs before yours and don't even care you have a child to take care of as well. Selfish people, just do what is best for you and try your best to not look back.", "Your sister did do something wrong - she agreed with Cleo's actions.  That's enough.", "NTA. I mean, if they aren\u2019t paying you then you don\u2019t need to give notice. Your sister is on the side of someone who is using you, so yes she absolutely did something wrong.", "NTA by a long shot. Cleo deliberately sabotaged your job opportunity so that you would have to keep watching her and your sister\u2019s kids for free/cheap. Your sister supported this so you know she was involved with what went down. Go get a different job without their help and never watch their kids again. Your mom can watch their kids.", "The fact that her sister supports Cleo and would also be losing her babysitter tells me that she was 100% involved in what Cleo did. They probably decided what to do together.", "I'll have to re-read the post. I think I missed the part that said she was food-insecure.", "She said she recently became a single parent to a baby, and was looking for a job that wasn't babysitting for people who choose not to pay her.", "First off, you're free to not babysit for any reason you want, so I'm not sure there's really a judgement to be made there.  That said, I'm curious about the whole reference situation, because it does seem really weird for someone to offer it, then back out.  Just curious, but did you put Cleo down as a reference for a position in which she is unable to legitimately provide a relevant recommendation?  You mention having only worked in childcare, so I'm curious if it's possible Cleo got a call from a prospective employer who asked her to vouch for your aptitude at an unrelated skill, and she truthfully admitted she couldn't?  As a random example, if someone called her up and said, \"Hi, OP put you as a reference for my carpentry business, would you recommend her as a good framer?  How's her hand at crafting custom cabinets?\". If Cleo has never even heard you mention carpentry, much less seen you do that sort of work, that makes things much less cut and dried.\n\nThat's really the only situation where I might have some understanding with regards to pulling the reference, because a situation like that would be asking someone to, essentially, lie for you (which can have implications for their own career if they're providing said reference to someone in their field).", "NTA. Cleo and your sister are sabotaging your job for their own purpose... and they think that is okay.\n\nyou need to limit any interaction with them ASAP as they know your situation and still want to destroy any future (job) you will have.\n \np.s you mum is wrong... get her to babysit their kids for free if she still supports them.", "NTA", "If you reside in the US, and live in either WA, OR, CO, or AZ, I can get in touch with some folks and maybe help you out. \n\nFeel free to DM me.", "NTA. Go to an employment agency if possible where you live. Explain the situation. They should be able to help you. In my country you have to get a license to work with children. If you\u2019re able to obtain that somehow perhaps this could be your line of work. It helps immensely if childcare is what you want to do. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re in a country where it works the same but please, get yourself out of that situation. You can\u2019t be relying on someone who betrayed you like this for your living wages.", "Please show this to sister.", "So, they don't pay you, they sabotage you getting a job, and your MOTHER is on their side? \nHoly cow, this is painful. \nNTA. At all. \nDo what you can to become independent from them and never do anything for them without being paid up front (if you want to do anything for them at all anymore, that is).", "You are NTA, your sister and Cleo certainly are. I think Cleo is hoping that you will go back to child minding for them since you haven\u2019t got a job.", "NTA", "NTA. Seems like Cleo sabotaged. If she didn't want to be a referee then she shouldn't have agreed. It seems like she's trying to keep you as a babysitter.", "NTA\n\nShe sabotaged you as a reference because she didn\u2019t want to lose out on her cheap babysitter.", "NTA. Bribery much?"]}
