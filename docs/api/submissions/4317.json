They're not \"family\" to OP if they're gonna treat her like this.", "Not only to keep OP as their babysitter, but how much do you want to bet that Chloe will expect to not have to pay more (or just not pay sometimes... because they're such good friends!)", "You\u2019re so awesome for that! I hope OP sees it", "Agreed don't even look at them!", "Like triple and to be paid up front,  with scaling punitive rates for being late, etc. In a contract that they sign so when they try to stiff her (they will), op can sue them/take them to collections.", "She's terrified if OP finds a job, SHE will be designated as unpaid babysitter. She's as selfish as OP's sister and Cleo.", "That sucks, but is just further proof that your sister is as bad as Cleo.", "Nta don\u2019t babysit n go LC on people like her. Obv NC with Cleo bc she is evil", "NTA. Cleo refused to give you a reference because she likes you as a free babysitter, please stop helping her unless she is paying you accurately for your service.", "Once again: **It was Cleo's plan with the sister to sabotage OP getting a job.**\n\nAnd I'll be honest: If I don't have kids? You better recognize that you need to manage yours because its not a shared problem. I have been the on demand and uncompensated nanny. No one should be stifled in life because other people need freaking child care. You knew before you had danged kids that somebody would have to take care of them, didn't you?", "I used to work in workforce development and abhor the practice of reference checks. It\u2019s basically only to prove you didn\u2019t lie on your resume or whatever, but it\u2019s such a loaded practice. Let\u2019s say a reference says something that turns into a hiring violation (e.g. accidentally reveals a health issue that had been shared with them) \u2014 in some cases, the employer needs to restart the entire hiring process. With the situation I shared above, my reference called me in a panic because he felt he had screwed over my shot. When I spoke to the board member, she copped to the fact that it was illegal and immoral as FUCK, but I had to understand that my reference responded to her \u201cunprofessionally\u201d. (He told her it was none of her business and that it was an inappropriate question and hung up on her.) I pointed out that what she did was a hiring process violation and legally, she needed to restart the process and I would not be applying that time. 6 months later, the person who they went with reached out because she \u201cfound my resume from her hiring pool\u201d and asked if I wanted her job. \n\nThe worst part was that when I told her what happened, she told me \u201cthat\u2019s such a shame and I\u2019m sorry that happened to you, but my interactions with [the board member] have always been great, you should give her another shot!\u201d Then she asked me to take a 60% pay cut and accept the job, because that would show I \u201chave no hard feelings.\u201d Unfortunately for her and them, I still have many hard feelings. But it\u2019s all working out, because I\u2019m now watching the org pick a fight with the wrong community organization and\u2026 oof, it\u2019s getting fun. Advice to small 501c(3)s \u2014 don\u2019t try to ban a group that helped you, especially not from the trails they built *for* you. \n\nBut yeah, that offer stands, not just for OP. Fuck reference checks. DM me, boos", "It's even worse, op does have kids. A kid anyway and she needs a better paying jobs so that she can provide for that child"]}
