I also have a son, Jack (15M) from my previous relationship.\n\nFor the first 18 months that I knew Lucy, she was in love with junk food. She would use the money she would get from babysitting the neighbors kids to buy cookies, chips, ice cream all the time. It was very unhealthy how much of that crap she was eating. I tried to politely encourage her to switch to something healthier that still tasted good like yogurt that she would always respond with \"you're not my mom\" and \"stop controlling my body\". Because of this she's put on a lot of weight.\n\nAnyway about 6 months ago, she got into an argument with a boy in school. They called each other names and he ended up calling her a hippo. That made her really self-conscious and she's been trying to improve her health since then. She threw out all the junk food we had at home and tries to exercise 3-4 times a week. She's been making steady progress and I'm happy that she's been taking care of herself.\n\nMy son however has recently taken a liking to Doritos chips. He doesn't eat a lot of it. Maybe a packet every other week. He mostly eats it in his room so Lucy hasn't seen him eating them. But a couple of days ago he was watching a tv show downstairs and he decided to eat his chips. I was cooking in the kitchen but then I heard an argument so I ran out to figure out what was going wrong. Lucy was mad at Jack for eating chips and told him to throw it out because she's trying to lose weight. My son said he can eat whatever he wants. I tried to calmly tell Lucy that  Jack is allowed to eat in a common space and if what he's eating is tempting her, she can nicely ask him to put it away or she can go to another room until he finishes if he declines her request. That just made her angrier and she accused me of \"playing favorites\" and \"sabotaging\" her progress. This pissed me off because I've done nothing but support her these past few months. I firmly told her she's almost 18 and she needs to grow up and accept that not everyone will follow her diet especially in their own homes. \n\nShe cried to her mom who's now blowing up my phone calling me a bitch for not supporting her daughter. My husband, her dad, is on my side but after sleeping on it, I think I could have used a gentler tone. So AITA?", "created_utc": 1697230186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1778cxj/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_she_needs_to/", "score": 2546, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her being on a diet doesn't mean other people diet as well.\n\nIf she can't eat chips, that's fine. It doesn't sound like other people are trying to force her to eat them. But if her argument is \"I'm on a diet so chips can't be in the house\", that only flies if it's her house. If she wants to control what food is her residence, then she would need to be the sole person paying for the residence.", "Look, in terms of the general topic of the conflict you're NTA, but it sounds like your concern is that you might have used some hurtful phrasing or tone, and simply could have handled it better, even if you're in the right on the general topic, and that's something I don't think this sub is in a position to judge. It's too context specific, and tone doesn't come across in text.", "NTA, but she should be talking to both her physician and a therapist as well as a dietician if she wants to actually do this in a healthy and sustainable manner.     If she actually has some kind of ED then it might be very helpful in the short term to minimize her exposure to trigger foods, but that doesn't mean everyone has to follow her diet or completely remove those trigger foods from the house.", "Wait people can eat Doritos in moderation? I thought you just eat the entire bag and hate yourself\u2026", "NTA. She's learning to manage her health and that's great but she doesn't get to dictate to other people because she's following a specific diet. \n\nHolding the entire house hostage because she's tempted isn't in any way appropriate.", "NTA - I would urge you to look up orthorexia. It's disordered eating where one becomes obsessed with healthy eating. I've struggled with it in the past, and it can be very difficult to identify that moment when you've gone past health consciousness into an unhealthy obsession. It sounds like you might not be able to broach the subject with your stepdaughter, but maybe her dad could have a heart-to-heart with her if you think it fits her behavior.", "NTA\nBut it is a red flag you were pleased that she was so traumatised by classmate insulting her appearance that she completely changed her diet to the point where food is a trigger.\nYou should be more concerned that your stepdaughter could be developing an eating disorder.", "Wondering how one-sided this story is.", "I'm going to get down voted for this but ESH. \n\nLucy goes from eating junk food constantly and gaining a lot of weight quickly after you moved in to somebody making fun of her and now she's suddenly dieting extremely to the point where even seeing other people eating that food is triggering to her and NOBODY thought that maybe she had an eating disorder? Nobody parsed out that maybe she was eating more because she just had a large shift in family dynamics not too long ago and could be stressed/upset? You say that when you tried to talk to her about it the first time she was immediately defensive and now she's set off by somebody even eating junk food while she's trying to get healthy. These are concerning behaviors around food and somehow nobody has thought to sit her down and maybe ask why food is a touchy topic for her? Sounds like everybody in this story aside from brother has some growing up to do.", "NTA\n\nBut I\u2019m concerned your step-daughter is working herself into an eating disorder.\n\nYou started with a gentle intervention and escalated to being more firm after Lucy accused you of favoritism and sabotage.\n\nSupporting someone should never mean you are expected to change your own habits; at the core of that expectation is an attempt to externalize motivation. That kind of approach is typically very short lived.\n\nIt also means that Lucy isn\u2019t really dealing with the core issue, but instead is trying to treat some foods like alcohol. And some of this may also be that Lucy\u2019s mother is planting the idea that support is everyone joining.\n\nHer trying to be healthier doesn\u2019t mean she gets to bully and insult other people for not following the same food restrictions.\n\nI think there is often space to be gentler, but we\u2019re human and that doesn\u2019t always mean someone is being an asshole.", "Monitor your stepdaughter, she probably has, or is on the cusp of developing an eating disorder.\n\nPeople should by-and-large try to be healthy, but it shouldn't stem from a place of shame. If that's where the motivation comes from, then it's a very slippery slope. Obsessing over eating and exercising is generally framed in a positive light these days but it is not good mental behaviour and can, especially in girls of her age, go to the extreme.\n\nThe way she reacted to simply seeing her step brother eating chips demonstrates an unhealthy perception of eating and food. Obviously she may recognise that she has a problem with junk food and removing it from the vicinity to remove the temptation to snack is one thing, but getting so worked up over someone else eating it (when he obviously stores the food out of sight) is problematic.", "NTA\n\nWhat you said was appropriate (if said the way you describe it). Her mom should be talking to her dad if she's angry -- Tell her that, say good bye, and hang up. Tell your husband if she ever calls you names again, you will immediately hang up.", "NTA. She controls what she eats, not what others do. You even offered her the example of politely asking your son to please eat it away from her.", "I think her dad should be involved in communication between you and her over serious topics. Either he should be the one mentioning it at all or should help mediate between the two of you to help clear the air and make sure feelings aren\u2019t hurt.", "NTA in this interaction but you will be if you don\u2019t recognise that this behaviour could be the sign of an ED. She\u2019s gone to another unhealthy habit even if the food isn\u2019t.", "I mean, you obviously don\u2019t like her, maybe it\u2019s that that she minds?", "yta, you called her snacks crap but phrased your sons snacks and his consumption of them very differently. that\u2019s through your own text, i\u2019m sure your step daughter notices the differences in your affection to him. you can make her feel more supported.", "NTA. Self-improvement shouldn't impose on others' freedoms. Learning to resist temptation is part of the process. Keep supporting, but with boundaries.", "NTA\n\nYou were accurate in what you said, and I doubt her mother is getting a calm factual retelling of the story from stepdaughter.\n\nHer mother's behavior is also assholeish and I'd probably mute/block her, but that's just me. No sense in having your peace ruined because of idiots.", "NTA.\n\nboth the mother and daughter sound like AH though. she is free to choose whatever diet she wants but she has no right to be demanding others change their diet cos of that. and if your partner doesnt see the problem in that, then its a red flag on its own.", "NTA - stepdaughter lives in a world full of temptation. She's going to have to learn how to navigate that by controlling herself. No amount is managing her environment is going to help if she can't control her own urges. She'll just give into them the first chance she gets. \n\nIf she wants to make a change like this, it has to come from within her. Honestly, she might benefit from reading about intuitive eating. It creates a positive drive to eat better by listening to what your body needs. It made a tremendous impact on my health.", "NTA. Dieting is a journey, a hard one, but it\u2019s hers to take. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate what other people eat. That\u2019s like actually ridiculous. Sure, she can ask\u2026but it\u2019s totally inappropriate for her to start an argument over someone refusing her request.", "NTA but be aware this is how eating disorders are born. \n\nI realize this is normalized, but being fatshamed is not the best motivation for losing weight. Health is a good motivator, exercise is a good tactic and so is healthy eating, but honestly if she's trying to change the numbers on a scale, that's probably not going to happen. \n\nLosing anything more than a five per cent of your body weight in the long term is all but impossible. If she manages to in the short term, she can expect to gain it back and a lot more. Go ahead and look it up if you don't believe me, I encourage you do your own research. \n\nAnd bear in mind, the longer she stays on the diet, the fewer calories her body is going to consume so the less effective the diet will be. And while that happens, the hormones governing hunger will get stronger and stronger, so you can expect her to react like this more often as she feels more and more like she's starving.", "NTA, as for her claiming you are playing favorites remind her that she has declared that you are not her mom and there for her needs are not your issue but the needs of your child are.  She will be going to college shortly.  She needs to learn that others in the cafeteria will not adjust what is on their plate to please her.  Her roommate will not toss away their own food because she has no self-control.", "I think it could have been handled better.. her dieting does not come from a place of self love it comes from insecurities. It seems like it was a sudden switch, a very emotional expression of how she felt she was not good enough. Getting angry at her for thinking irrationally because of her intense emotions is not beneficial in anyway. I understand getting frustrated, but you made it about you, how you\u2019ve been supporting her so how dare she say those things, when she\u2019s clearly asking for help in managing these feelings. You can\u2019t fix an emotional issue with logic. Talk to her about how she\u2019s been feeling since the diet, is she feeling happier and healthier? Stronger and more confident? Does she feel more connected to her body? Just ask her how she feels.", "NTA, but there are a couple of things at play here:\n\n1) She has an unhealthy relationship with food. Much like an alcoholic could be tempted by being around people drinking, so she is with junk food.  I would be concerned that her diet is knocking on an eating disorder, given her reaction to chips in her presence.\n\n2) You are right about \u201calmost being an adult \u201c, but not in the way you are thinking. Many 17/18 year olds, go through a \u201cstretching their wings \u201c period where they are kind of jerks as they figure out how to adult. \n\n3) You are not her mother, and you came into her broken family at a developmental critical time (not your fault at all). Lecturing a 17 year old is dramatic at the best of times, but throwing in some likely unresolved family dynamics\u2026ugh.", "ESH.\n\nTeenager gains weight after a change in her home dynamic, her stepmother thinks it appropriate to comment on it, teenager has sudden drastic idea of dieting which seems to involve significant restriction.\n\nPut two and two together here.", "NTA.\n\nBut you owe her an apology if you are not proud of the way you spoke to her.\n\nKeep being supportive and she will understand that you are not playing favourites. You are the adult here. Teenagers live their emotions stronger.\n\nMaybe suggest some fun low carb recipies of tasty snacks you could make together? That might make her react less aggressively to others eating junk every now and then.\n\nDiets are hard.... of course you cant force others to follow them, but especially when you start out yourself, temptation is a bit*h... so try to make it easier for her :)", "NTA\n\n> told **him** to throw it out because **she's** trying to lose weight\n\nLol. No, that's **not how this works**.\n\n> if what he's eating is tempting her, she can nicely ask him to put it away\n\nUh, no. Fuck that noise. I'm even tempted to give you an ESH for suggesting that she has the right to even ask people to not eat what they want around her.\n\nLet her be tempted all day. Temptation doesn't make you fat.", "Commenting on food and weight is a straight away to an ED. You are NTA but please keep this mind when you navigate your relationship with her as this can be very traumatic.", "NTA. But careful, she's dangerously close to an ED if not already.", "NTA.  Addressing negative eating patterns and developing a healthy relationship with food is a much healthier route than food avoidance and policing what other people consume.", "NTA. you\u2019re right, she can have her diet but she doesn\u2019t get to control what others are eating especially since he has been good about keeping it out of sight for the most part. her controlling what others eat won\u2019t actually help her, it just means that she has issues with food that run deeper than just enjoying junk food occasionally and wanting to be healthier. if her mother has an issue, she can take it up with your husband.", "NTA, but I don't think it's normal for her to get this upset about someone eating junk food in front of her.\nI don't think it's just a self-centered thing - there may be a deeper reason behind it. I don't think you should write this off as her being unreasonable (her expectation IS unreasonable) because it sounds like she might need help. It may be desperate instead of intentionally demanding, if that makes sense.", "NTA.  I am no mental health professional either, however to me these issues Lucy has sound like red flags for a potential eating disorder and her father may want to consider having her see a health provider for an evaluation.", "Using the phrase \u201cgrow up\u2026\u201d is a condescending term. That  alone make you an AH. You could have said all of that in a way that showed a mature level of emotional intelligence.", "I'm gonna go against the grain here and say YTA. Losing weight is friggin hard for a teen. It is even harder when you have people eating junk food around you and that's the stuff you used to crave. Maybe I'm a bid jaded as I've recently worked with teens who are well on their way to diabetes, bariatric surgery and weight loss drugs and see how hard they struggle. One of the things that helps the best is a house free of junk food/snack food/sugary beverages. Conversely the teens in households where other members of the family continue to eat junk food/snack food/whatever really struggle. And tbch it is very unusual where there is only one overweight person in the house, usually the entire family can benefit from a bit of clean eating. \n\nIts almost like having an early stage recovering alcoholic live with you and you wave their favorite drink in front of them.", "YTA - think of quitting eating food like that like an addiction. \n\nYour son doesn\u2019t need to hide in his room, and she shouldn\u2019t be yelling at him. BUT ALSO your response was not helpful.\n\nShe does need support right now", "YTA and you've been so right along. First you picked on her for eating poorly, and when she decided to change her diet, you're still finding fault with her. Poor kid can't do anything right in your eyes. She probably has an eating disorder now, at least in part thanks to you. No wonder Doritos freak her out. Congratulations, you helped that happen.\n\n>I think I could have used a gentler tone.\n\nYes. Yes you could have. But that's not all. \n\nYou MIGHT be able to make this right if you start with a sincere apology, an acknowledgement that you'll do better in the future, and an offer to sit down with her *and her father, her actual parent* where you work out how everyone's going to get to eat what they need/want, possibly with some boundaries on your son's behavior as well, at least for awhile. Lucy might need eating disorder treatment. \n\nIt's the least you can do after such a long history of policing her food and eating.", "NTA- Lucy doesn't get to dictate what, when, or where anyone else eats. Imagine her outrage if anyone tried to do that to her. Oh, wait, you don't have to imagine it- you've experienced it. That's what I'd tell her. And that any outrage or poor behavior she continues to carry on in that vein will simply be construed as poor behavior and acting out and will be addressed as such. \n\nWe love you, We support you, and we encourage you to make healthy choices- but none of this is a license to be a bully.", "This is a good way to give her an eating disorder.  YTA", "NTA\n\nYes, it's kind not to have a load of junk food lying around when someone's trying to stick to a diet. For exactly the same reason that you shouldn't do your grocery shopping when you're hungry - it's easy to be tempted if you're hungry, and there's a tasty no-good snack right there.\n\nBut you're not leaving junk food lying around the house. Jack is eating a single bag of chips. If you're kind, then the chips aren't in a common pantry, but Jack has them stashed away in his room or something, and gets a packet when he wants one.\n\nDoes Lucy also demand that all the kids at school throw away their unhealthy snacks? Does she refuse to enter the school canteen and see the pizza for sale? There's a happy medium between ensuring that the only food that ever appears in front of Lucy's eyes is a salad, and leaving bowls of open candy lying around your house. It sounds like you're on the \"be kind to Lucy's diet\" end of that happy medium. You are being as supportive of her diet as is reasonable.", "NTA. How the hell does she think it's reasonable to demand someone else to throw away their food because she can't resist the temptation?", "NTA, you were completely reasonable", "NTA", "YTA. She's a teenager getting used to a new family dynamic and realizing she hasn't been taking care of herself. She's also doing what you originally wanted her to do.  You need to support the sh\\*t out of this and get Jack onboard too. You only have so much time until this young lady is out of your house. Be someone she can depend on. As a step parent myself, your attitude is really disappointing.", "NTA but try to be supportive you know how teenagers are.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he wasn't even offering her any, as it seems everyone is aware of her diet.\n\nIt's great that she's decided to take control of her diet. Please continue to support her in that while not letting her try to control other people's diets.", ">*I tried to calmly tell Lucy that Jack is allowed to eat in a common space and if what he's eating is tempting her, she can nicely ask him to put it away or she can go to another room until he finishes if he declines her request.*\n\nNTA\n\nI can relate from a time when my dad's girlfriend wanted to lose weight and our dinner options turned into whatever WeightWatcher packets were in the freezer.", "NTA\n\nJust because she is on a diet doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is", "NTA, if she had a legit addiction to a specific food type she could ask for accommodation but \u2018I will throw out all the family\u2019s junk food and demand you all abide by my diet\u2019 is not fair.

But I would apologize for your tone and how you said things especially because even you know you could have used different ways to express yourself. I also would softly suggest healthier ways to lose weight because it is very easy (especially for young girls with access to the internet) to fall into diet and ED culture. Too many of my friends did exactly that because they were insecure about their weight. And that path leads to nothing but sorrow and hospital rooms.", "NTA but maybe bring her to a therapist. This outburst might suggest she's overly fixated on food (or the food she cannot eat).", "You are NTA, but you are certainly the adult and you should act like it.

The reason:\nI grew up in an unhealthy household. After that, I lost some weight but gained it back (due to being in a healthy relationship). I also don't like seeing chips or chocolate in our household because I don't want to feel tempted to take something. BUT I'm 24, and I know that it is a problem resolving around me and not my boyfriend. She is 18, still in puberty, low self esteem ect. (I don't want to guess here), so she still doesn't know how to resent those temptations. \nThe best would be to just talk to her in private because I think she might be going through some stuff.

These are real world conditions. A gentler tone probably would have worked better. \n\nThough it's worth noting that pressuring her to change what was she was eating in a passive (aggressive) way like you've mentioned here could be contributing to the rigidity of how she's trying to adhere to her changes now. \n\nWhen you're getting bombarded with messages that how you eat is wrong and you finally change and try to do it perfectly  - it feels fundamentally unfair when you then don't hold the same with even minor \"infractions\" with other people in the house. \n\nWhich is to say you're not wrong for telling her other people can eat what they like in the common areas, but I don't think it was okay to 1 - have such a wildly critical view of how she was eating before and 2 - make sure she knew you had this view. You've been hear thinking you modeled \"healthy eating\" but she's showing you what you actually modeled - intense criticism of how other people eat.", "Consider finding her a therapist\u2026I fear an eating disorder or poor self esteem, either already present or coming soon", "First off, your son shouldn\u2019t have to throw out the Doritos. \n\nSecondly, she probably should talk to a professional about her goals.

Where on earth do you live where this isn\u2019t the standard advice and norm?\n\nETA: putting this here so people see it immediately: this isn\u2019t about permission. Overweight and obese people often have significant other health issues to address, including nutrient deficiencies, before even considering weight loss. You should absolutely be getting your bloods done before and regularly throughout your weight loss journey because any number of things can go wrong due to a combination of the actual physiology of weight loss and the stress it puts on the body + the poor education provided to adults, let alone children, about nutrition. Regular checkups throughout your weight loss can even dictate **how** you lose weight.\nFor example, imagine if Lucy had developed PCOS without knowing. Not at all uncommon for overweight girls. Being overweight in itself can mimic PCOS and so Lucy may just dismiss any signs as normal; however, PCOS comes with high risk of insulin resistance. Imagine Lucy cuts out junk but instead replaces it with a carb-rich diet. Yes, they may be complex carbs and she may assume it\u2019s perfectly fine because the calories may be lower, but in reality she may still be eating a high carb diet. It\u2019s unfair to expect a child to understand these things when there are adults out there who don\u2019t - even doctors who don\u2019t have much nutritional education as the emphasis on evidence-based training in it is only a recent phenomenon in med schools! Therefore, Lucy may be at risk of diabetes without a single clue if she doesn\u2019t consult a doctor beforehand and get relevant tests done before and throughout her weight loss. It\u2019s about **safety**. Another example is how common iron deficiency anaemia is amongst people who put themselves on an assumedly healthy diet by cutting out certain things, but unfortunately lack the understanding of what to replace them with and on top of their existing poor baseline, now further restrict their bodies. It\u2019s so common that \u2018young dieting female\u2019 is one of the buzzphrases in med school exams where I live.", "If she\u2019s reacting this way to being exposed to it, there\u2019s something up.
