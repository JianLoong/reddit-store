She was born with cancer and died when she was only 5 weeks old. I was born 2 years later and her memory was very strong throughout my life. My parents weren't great parents to me because they were still in very heavy grief and it made our relationship complicated. I remember they cried on her birthday every year and they also cried on most of mine and she was mentioned at every celebration. I remember for a while really wanting to hear more about her but at some point all the mentions of her were too much, it felt suffocating and I felt less important. When they'd meet new people Summer was the child they mentioned first, and the one they talked most about. Someone would ask what grade I was in or how old I was and they'd say Summer would be in fourth grade or Summer would have been 13 today. When I graduated high school I asked that my parents not to mention Summer during the celebration after (we had a dinner with family and a couple of my friends but not a full blown party) and they were so angry at me for wanting Summer forgotten. I took some time from them in college but was wracked with guilt and we ended up back in touch.\n\nI got married to my husband Cael last year and now we're expecting a girl. My parents brought up how amazing it would be for us to name our daughter Summer and my husband was 100% on board. He was pretty much agreeing before I had a chance to react. When I did talk to him he was shocked I had any doubts and was ready to go full steam ahead. I told him I wanted our daughter to have her own name and I didn't want her to carry the weight of the Summer who never got the chance to grow up, and so was all her grandparents really wanted to talk about. He said he understood but to think of how loved our daughter would feel. And he knows I think Summer is a beautiful name, because I do. But the history.\n\nI told my parents I wanted my daughter to have her own name and they cried. They didn't really comment. They then asked was I going to change my mind (this was a few days after) and I said no. But then my parents and husband were talking and wanted to try and change my mind. They brought a list of pros to me on why our daughter should be Summer and I told them I disagreed with the list, they argued back and told me Summer deserves to be honored. I said my daughter deserves to live life as herself. Cael said she would still be able to and the name isn't that uncommon that my sister would be the only person to think of. My parents told me to think of what my sister would want and how I love my sister and miss her every day. For some reason that broke me. I started to cry out of nowhere and told the three of them I did not want to name my daughter after a sister I never knew. I'm not totally sure what happened directly after I was so upset. But Cael and my parents think I was cruel to say it like that.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682176665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v913g/aita_for_telling_my_parents_and_my_husband_that_i/", "score": 5244, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not so sure why he\u2019s so bullish on the name since he doesn\u2019t have the same emotional investment, but he really shit the bed backing your parents here. Essentially he\u2019s saying he\u2019s okay with your feelings being diminished every day of your life and seeing you continue to play second fiddle, and passing that on to your child. I\u2019d ask him the following:\n\n- why is he so on board with this?\n- why is he okay with furthering your suffering?\n- why won\u2019t he support you?\n- why is he more concerned with the feelings of others than the feelings of his wife?\n\nThis is a big red flag. If he can be so easily swayed, I sincerely doubt he\u2019d be able to stand up for you in more dire circumstances. Your emotional health is important and he\u2019s okay with leaving you in your parents wake. \n\nYour parents are gonna be more straightforward. You can\u2019t trust your husband to back you here, so you\u2019ll need to find some gumption. Your husband be damned, tell them you\u2019ve chosen a name, that\u2019s the name, and it WILL NOT change. Any attempt to nickname or call your daughter any reference to your late sister and there will be hell to pay. Tell your parents your truth, your honesty, that they were shit to you and are STILL being shit to you. I empathize with their loss but the fact that they made their loss their entire personalities and never processed their grief should not impact a new generation. You suffered enough, and you\u2019re a good momma with good instincts for not allowing your daughter to suffer the same. Give them the choice: you and your daughter, or the memories of the one they lost and nothing else. No delivery room. No visits. They also need therapy to show that they\u2019re willing to work on themselves. This isn\u2019t about just a name, they haven\u2019t moved on. Everyone will continue to live with this stress if they don\u2019t work on this. \n\n\nCongrats on your little! You\u2019re gonna be a great mom cause you already are!!!!", "NTA- your daughter is NOT a replacement for the child they lost. Your parents need therapy, and should have gotten it long ago. I would be preparing for them to be consumed in your daughters life in a very unhealthy way, and to use GUILT to force their will on you. Start setting boundaries now, protect your daughter from living a life in the shadow of a corpse. \n\nAs for your husband he is being a AH, naming a child is a situation where both parents have to say yes( and ONLY the parents.) If one says no the answer is NO. Him pushing you is unacceptable, him doing it in front of your parents is disrespectful and cruel. I would be very cautious, and not allow him to fill out the birth certificate, because he has proven he will bully you to get his way.", "NTA but your husband is for disregarding your feelings on this. You need couples counseling if he pushes this. You lived your life in the shadow of your parents grief & your husband siding with them is 100% wrong. Your parents need grief counseling because they are going to continue to live in the past instead of celebrating a new generation and thinking of the future. I would sit down with them & tell them you will absolutely NOT be naming her after your sister and the minute they bring her up or compare your child to her you will be limiting contact with them.", "NTA. \n\nGiven your parents' obsession with their late daughter your child would not have her own identity. She'd constantly be compared to her even though your sister died at 5 weeks so they'd not really have anything to compare to. \n\nOr, if your daughter resembled Summer they'd basically try to live as though your daughter was theirs come back to life. If your daughter did not resemble Summer at all they'd be disappointed.\n\nPrince William said the reason they named their daughter Charlotte and not Diana as a first name was they wanted her to have her own identity, and not be constantly compared to an iconic grandmother she never knew.\n\nIt's too heavy  a burden for a child to carry all her life.", "NTA. I really don't understand why your husband is on board with this. Is he aware of how you have felt about having  Summer always casting a shadow over your life? If not, share this post with him.", "INFO: How long we\u2019re you with your  husband before you got married?\n\nI find it hard to believe he would side with your parents if he has seen this behavior come up again and again for years where they unsurreptitiously inserted Summer\u2019s existence into events not meant for her.\n\nAlso, IDK how someone can expect someone else to \u201cmiss\u201d someone they literally never knew\u2026who died two years before they were even born\u2026.that\u2019s all sorts of crazy.\n\nAdditionally, I just had to say this, based on the following statement:\n\n>When they'd meet new people Summer was the child they mentioned first, and the one they talked most about. Someone would ask what grade I was in or how old I was and they'd say Summer would be in fourth grade or Summer would have been 13 today. \n\nPeople were probably so confused. And many probably called OP, \"Summer\", because of this. I bet they got the shock of their life when they found out she wasn't Summer.", "NTA; also your husband needs to get on board and support you on this. If not, he is an asshole along with your parents", "NTA. It is extremely selfish for your parents to be so pushy on this.", "You are NTA, but you will be if you name this child after your dead sister - no nickname, no middle name, none of that BS. Your daughter will never measure up to the dead baby that never got to be a real person, and giving her the name in any form would be cruel to the living child you bring into the world. It will come with a heavy mantel of expectations. This is a hill to die on.", "NTA, good heavens. Your husband, though...  I think you should show him this post and the responses.\n\nIt's possible, even likely, that he means well. At any rate, it's clear he hasn't understood the impact that this has had on your life. But your post makes it very clear, so reading it might help him be more compassionate towards you, going forward.\n\nAs for your parents, I'm so sorry they've treated you like this. Their grief is more than natural; the way they've chosen to live with their grief less so.", "Nta\n\nWhat is wrong with your husband? You said no, it's a no. Naming children is 2 yes or it's a no.\n\n\nI don't understand how your husband could think it's a good idea. Did you ever discuss the heartache of feeling like the invisible child growing up with him?\n\nBecause if you have and he still jumped at the chance to agree with them, he is even a bigger jerk than I originally thought.", "NTA \nThe parents are being selfish but how could understand the husband not be on your side!?!?!?\nI agree that giving her that name would result in her not being able to live her life especially if she does things in the future that OP's parents are not okay with, they would care a lot more and such if name was summer as they would not expect their daughter to do this, so why can their granddaughter\nOP u are in the right\nMake this ur hill to die down", "NTA\n\n\nTell your parents flat out. You never knew or loved sUmmer and she was forced down your throat. You want your daughter to NOT suffer as they made you suffer in the shadow of the child they hsd thet never got to grow up. You do not want to enflict that trama on your child. This is a hill to die on and tell your husband If he cannot accept your trama and feeling he can kick rocks too. Your Daughter Is NOT a replacement for your lost sister. Show this to Husband", "NTA.  I completely agree with you, naming her Summer won't let her have a life of her own in the eyes of your parents.  To them, I would say, it's never too late for therapy because it seems like they still have a boatload of unresolved grief.\n\nIf I were you, I'd find out why your husband is so eager to ignore you and side with your parents.", "Absolutely NTA. Your parents should have got therapy early on. Your husband needs a reality check - Summer has dominated every aspect of your life. It isn't fair to pass that on to a new baby.", "NTA. I\u2019d be really concerned with your husband so readily disregarding the level of trauma that dealing with that as a kid created for you. People that doesn\u2019t experience can\u2019t fathom it. That name is connected to those bad memories and experiences. You will always be reminded of those bad memories when you hear that name. It could lead to resentment. I\u2019d expect your parents to try and be too heavily involved cause they\u2019d get a second chance with Summer.  It would happen all over again. Your parents are doing it by trying to get you to use the name. They don\u2019t care what you want or how it affected you. \n\nYou really need to make sure your husband understands how that affected you and the level of trauma that you still carry from it. I mean hell you broke from your parents and guilt too you back.

These people have clearly never loved you or even taken the time to get to know you. Yes, it was their grief that was interfering, but that doesn't excuse them from the terrible emotional neglect and abuse you have suffered because of it and are still suffering. \n\nGive your husband this post, and hopefully he will completely understand and will help you stand up to your parents.\n\nDo NOT use the name Summer in any way, shape, or form. No \"S\" names, etc. What your parents did to you your whole life is just awful and I hope you can get some therapy to help you come to terms with it and to help you go LC or NC with your parents.", "Hard NTA.  Kids are not living memorials to dead people.  Your parents clearly haven't processed their grief in a healthy way.  Your husband should be backing you up and it is concerning that he's not.", "Nta\nYou have the right to want your daughter to be her own person, and not live in the shadow of a person she\u2019ll never know.", "You\u2019re NTA. Even if you did know her, you might not want that for her name. I\u2019ve never understood burdening a child like that, either. Particularly when it\u2019s a life cut short. \n\nYour parents have beyond dropped the ball. In mourning their deceased daughter, they\u2019ve neglected the live one. But at least I understand their motivations. What the hell is your husband\u2019s? \n\nFind out why he\u2019s doing this. Then ask him why the hell, especially at this moment, you are not his very first priority.", ">My parents told me to think of what my sister would want\n\nYour sister would want??? She lived for five weeks two years before you were born. Her wanting anything in this context is impossible. Your parents have created a fictional perfect Summer from hope and dreams and grief that no real person would ever have been. Saddling your daughter with living up to that is a bad idea.\n\nBeyond counselling, maybe some kind of project that commemorates Summer's existence would help them channel their obsession in a better direction and distract them from trying to make your life about this sad event before you were even born. Raising funds for research into neonatal cancers perhaps or funds or facilities for other families going through this.\n\nNTA and congratulations on your daughter.", ">My parents told me to think of what my sister would want\n\nWith all due respect, your parents don't even know what she would have wanted. \nOnly what kind of personality they imagined for her as they never got to know her.

She was born with cancer and died when she was only 5 weeks old. I was born 2 years later and her memory was very strong throughout my life. My parents weren't great parents to me because they were still in very heavy grief and it made our relationship complicated. I remember they cried on her birthday every year and they also cried on most of mine and she was mentioned at every celebration. I remember for a while really wanting to hear more about her but at some point all the mentions of her were too much, it felt suffocating and I felt less important. When they'd meet new people Summer was the child they mentioned first, and the one they talked most about. Someone would ask what grade I was in or how old I was and they'd say Summer would be in fourth grade or Summer would have been 13 today. When I graduated high school I asked that my parents not to mention Summer during the celebration after (we had a dinner with family and a couple of my friends but not a full blown party) and they were so angry at me for wanting Summer forgotten. I took some time from them in college but was wracked with guilt and we ended up back in touch.\n\nI got married to my husband Cael last year and now we're expecting a girl. My parents brought up how amazing it would be for us to name our daughter Summer and my husband was 100% on board. He was pretty much agreeing before I had a chance to react. When I did talk to him he was shocked I had any doubts and was ready to go full steam ahead. I told him I wanted our daughter to have her own name and I didn't want her to carry the weight of the Summer who never got the chance to grow up, and so was all her grandparents really wanted to talk about. He said he understood but to think of how loved our daughter would feel. And he knows I think Summer is a beautiful name, because I do. But the history.\n\nI told my parents I wanted my daughter to have her own name and they cried. They didn't really comment. They then asked was I going to change my mind (this was a few days after) and I said no. But then my parents and husband were talking and wanted to try and change my mind. They brought a list of pros to me on why our daughter should be Summer and I told them I disagreed with the list, they argued back and told me Summer deserves to be honored. I said my daughter deserves to live life as herself. Cael said she would still be able to and the name isn't that uncommon that my sister would be the only person to think of. My parents told me to think of what my sister would want and how I love my sister and miss her every day. For some reason that broke me. I started to cry out of nowhere and told the three of them I did not want to name my daughter after a sister I never knew. I'm not totally sure what happened directly after I was so upset. But Cael and my parents think I was cruel to say it like that.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I get that people do this to honor others and that's fine.  But this is taking it to a weird extreme due to your parents being unable to let go for all these years.

That's a lot of weight, pressure, and responsibility she never asked for, and it would feel like a curse and punishment just for being born. Summer 2 still wouldn't be as important as Summer 1.

You need to be very clear with your husband and your parents.  They treated you horribly as a child.  They made your life all about their loss.

Set boundaries and hard limits that you both agree on, for before, during, and after you give birth. Counseling for the two of you on this might be helpful; have a neutral 3rd party to help mediate. Even if he doesn't want to go, you should if you are able.

Her youngest son died due to a  congenital issue, her pain has never really gone away. \n\nBut how your parents are dealing with it is not healthy.

I think this is why it is hurting so much - it has also perhaps made you (internally) realise that they will never change - they will never seen the actual you - and they will do the same to your daughter or she will supersede you and get acknowledged in a way you never were. I\u2019d go no contact with them and talk to your husband firmly about this and how much it has damaged your life and how you won\u2019t have it affect your daughter\u2019s life too or your future happiness as a family - separate from your parents - because there\u2019s also a weird control aspect here.

It\u2019s not about the name, it\u2019s the history with it like you said.

The most she says about her is on her birthday when she says \"she would've been _____\" and \"you were named after her and i named her that because of a song\" and never once did she let her grief make my sister feel like she was second best. She sometimes talks about finding her dead or how she reacted outside the hospital when they officially announced her as dead at the scene. But like, nothing about what could've been.

No calls. No visits. They will not get to meet your child. Nothing. If they EVER refer to your child as Summer - even once - they will lose their relationship with you and her.

Blow them up, blow your extended family up for not calling them out on their BS when you were a child. Go scorched earth. Its time. You have the opportunity now to get in front of all of this because it is going to be MUCH harder to deal with them once the baby is here. If they think they will lose access to your child they are much more likely to play ball.

Until they get the help they desperately need, process the grief they have over Summer and stop trying to make literally EVERY facet of my life about the death of a person I never met, they are cut off totally and completey.\"\n\nThis might actually force them to get help and it would put the entire extended family on notice that your parents are unhinged.\n\nSometimes, sadly, people need tough love and while I don't believe in dramas playing out on social media it could be that the pressure they receive will force them into grief therapy.", "Definitely. It's so sick and sad.", "Agreed. A doula and someone OP can trust implicitly as support people. NOT her husband.", "You know who\u2019s been enabling her parents?  OP.  Now you can\u2019t really fault her,  but she\u2019s been unwittingly a substitute Summer her whole life.  If it were me, I\u2019d change my name to something else.", "That is so creepy but I absolutely believe it could be true", "\"Well, you see, we have two children. Summer passed, but she would have been 13, OP is 11.\"  \"We were thinking about enrolling Summer in girl scouts.\" \"Summer would have looked so beautiful in a blue prom dress...\"", "You just took petty to the next level. I like you!", "Maybe a goldfish instead. Can\u2019t name a kid after a goldfish!!!", "Damn smart move!", "So, your source is you made it the fuck up.", "I feel like she could get her In Laws on board here. I mean, objectively, they'll likely see how sick this entire situation is and help her husband understand how damaging it would be to the baby and how hurtful he is being to OP", "Seriously. Summer was a baby. She wanted milk and sleep and fresh diapers, and I doubt she ever concerned herself with her possible niblings' names. It seems like a dick move to use her life as an excuse for trying to name someone else's child.", "Or My Sweet Audrina.", "A pet that dies quickly like a fish...", "I have cousins named Summer, Sunny, and Autumn.", "Summantha", "NTA OP.  Do NOT let them bully you into making your daughter their do-over attempt.  Honestly, if they're pushing so hard, I'm make sure you have a doula or somebody in the birthing room who will advocate for you.  IDK if where you are allows the husband to fill out the birth certificate or not, but if they do don't take the chance that he'll name your daughter Summer while you're sleeping or recovering and then it'll be a HUGE hassle to get it changed if you can without the other parent's consent.\n\nI'm sorry you've had to take a backseat to your parents grief your entire life.  I want to say I sympathize with them, but I worked very hard to make sure my kids never felt like that, so I actually do not.\n\nI had a very premature stillborn daughter... it'll be 18 years ago in June.  I got pregnant again very fast, and my daughter was then born in May of 2006.  There was no way in Hell I would have been OK with naming my daughter or with anybody in my family naming their daughters after my oldest.  The biggest fight to date with my MIL was because our 1st daughter has her mother's name.  When we found out our 2nd was also a girl, she was pissed off we wouldn't reuse the name and said, \"That one doesn't count!\" when we reminded her of WHY her mother's name wasn't being considered.\n\nMy kids knew there were days I was sad while they were growing up, but they never really knew why until they were older.  I believe my daughter was 12 and my son was 9 when they overheard my husband and I talking about our oldest on her birthday.  We never wanted them to live with that pain while they were so young.  Our daughter of knowing she wouldn't be here at all had her sister not died, and both of them of knowing they had a sibling they never got to meet.  When they heard us, we gave them a very basic, age-appropriate description of what happened, and decided we wouldn't bring our oldest daughter up to them again until they asked us about her.  It took until my daughter was 16 before she wanted to hear the full story.  My son still hasn't asked, he may never and that's honestly fine.\n\nI don't try to force my entire family to live in grief with me.  It is a pain that never goes away, but you have to learn to live around it... not wallow in it like your parents have.  Life doesn't stop moving for anything, and I don't want mine to be nothing but pain and pining for what I can never have back.  It sounds like your parents never got to that point.", "I'm stuck on the fact that OP's parents told her that she misses her sister every day.. I feel for the parent's grief but this is next level delusion", "Absolutely.\n\nI don't normally advocate for being cruel but its at the point where their cruelty towards OP needs to be met with some harsh truths.\n\nOP do you have aunts, uncles, grandparents... anyone else you can talk to about all of this who can have your back right now?", "Person: *I have a minor disagreement with my SO...*\n\nRedditors in their basement: **DIVORCE! DIVORCE! DIVORCE!**", "My brother in the whatever Heavenly power you believe in, OP's parents neglected/always compared them to a sister they never knew and now want to do that to OP's daughter. This is a toxic cycle of obsession. They won't love their granddaughter unless she acts as a replacement for their dead kid? Weird...", "Being traumatized is not an excused. They refuse to seek help and traumatized op in turn.", "No it shouldn\u2019t be a middle name. Op has nothing to apologize for. Stop continuing the cycles of victims apologizing for their bad parents have Ming their feelings hurt by a reasonable boundary", "Heck, have him read this whole string so he can see what a stark raging AH he is for pushing his wife on this.\n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me. If he can't support OP with this and have her back, he won't support her or have her back on anything. This is so simple. So straightforward. The fact that he is unwiling to see how damaging his behavior is concerns me.", ">No and it is not something I would ever bring up to them because I saw their reaction to someone else suggesting it. They want nothing to do with therapy.\n\nBut, they DO want a relationship with your child.\n\nI'd force it. They get no contact with you OR your child from here on out until they get into grief therapy. They don't have to like it but you refuse to have any contact with them in the future until they do so and you refuse to EVER allow your daughter around them until they do so. If they want a relationship with her then they have to get help.\n\nThey way they behave is sick. Truly unabashedly sick. \n\nIn fact, I think you should send this thread to them so they can see that they are sick.", "And if the name is used in any way, imagine how they'll play favorites if OP has more children later.", "Sis, it might not feel like it but you have ALL the power here. ALL of it. You hold all the cards.\n\nThey can want something until the cows come home but you make the decisions. You are baby girl's Mama and the only person who will stand up for her so YOU need to stop being the girl who was abused by her parents and be the WOMAN who is going to keep her children from being abused by their Grandparents.\n\nAnd that means setting the firm boundary with your husband now. Tell him the subject is not up for discussion and thats final. Other names are on the table but Summer and any names that sound similar or start with an S are off the table fully.\n\nGo for a full blow opposite name - a historic or \"old\" name like Matilda or Winnifred (Winnie) or Genevieve. Something long but can be shortened to something cute and spunky to ensure there is no way the name Summer can be put in there.\n\nI'd even go with a middle name from his family. Talk to his Mom and honor her Mom or his Dad's Mom with the middle name. Get them on board with the name. Announce the baby's name. Get onesies embroidered with her name on Etsy. Literally get her name front and center EVERYWHERE so that people start calling the baby by her name at least a month before. Get your husband connected to the baby's name - thinking of her as that name. Tag him on social media with maternity pictures of you and baby (name the baby) so that EVERYONE knows the name of your future child. Then, as soon as she's born get a cousin or BFF or SIL or someone to go on social media and immediately announce her birth, full name, weight, height, etc...", "> They gave me a similar enough name. \n\nSince you\u2019re using a throwaway account, what is it?  Who is more fixated on the constant memorializing of \u201cSummer\u201d, mom or dad?  What do your relatives say about this?", "> The only two opinions that matter are yours and his.\n\nPersonally I think that the only opinion that matters here is OP's.

They'll probably get ignored because they 'aren't Summer' and the cycle will repeat.\n\nMy mum favours my oldest (she has like 13 grandkids and he is the ONLY one named in the will).

Only he got special shopping trips. Only he got special birthday presents and extra Christmas presents. Only he got special trips. It was very obvious to the rest of us siblings that he got special treatment. You don't want that for your future other children. And it took a toll on my mom that she couldn't fight my dad and his parents on it. Took a toll on her relationship with my dad. And his parents.", "Yes I was thinking the grandparents somehow see this baby as being a reincarnation of their lost baby. I'm sure they are going to be overbearing and interfering , and if OP doesn't put her foot down they are going to simply expect they can make many more decisions , ignoring their daughter's opinions. \" Of course baby Summer will do ballet.

My brother has made his name his own.\n\nIn this case I feel the child will have expectations and pressure put on her, and that is an unfair burden. I think what you said about replacement is spot on. This kind of name should be given out of love, not because someone forced it.", "Oh yes, they want Christmas with summer, they never had that...sad faces... For a start.
