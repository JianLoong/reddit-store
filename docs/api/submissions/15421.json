She was born with cancer and died when she was only 5 weeks old. I was born 2 years later and her memory was very strong throughout my life. My parents weren't great parents to me because they were still in very heavy grief and it made our relationship complicated. I remember they cried on her birthday every year and they also cried on most of mine and she was mentioned at every celebration. I remember for a while really wanting to hear more about her but at some point all the mentions of her were too much, it felt suffocating and I felt less important. When they'd meet new people Summer was the child they mentioned first, and the one they talked most about. Someone would ask what grade I was in or how old I was and they'd say Summer would be in fourth grade or Summer would have been 13 today. When I graduated high school I asked that my parents not to mention Summer during the celebration after (we had a dinner with family and a couple of my friends but not a full blown party) and they were so angry at me for wanting Summer forgotten. I took some time from them in college but was wracked with guilt and we ended up back in touch.\n\nI got married to my husband Cael last year and now we're expecting a girl. My parents brought up how amazing it would be for us to name our daughter Summer and my husband was 100% on board. He was pretty much agreeing before I had a chance to react. When I did talk to him he was shocked I had any doubts and was ready to go full steam ahead. I told him I wanted our daughter to have her own name and I didn't want her to carry the weight of the Summer who never got the chance to grow up, and so was all her grandparents really wanted to talk about. He said he understood but to think of how loved our daughter would feel. And he knows I think Summer is a beautiful name, because I do. But the history.\n\nI told my parents I wanted my daughter to have her own name and they cried. They didn't really comment. They then asked was I going to change my mind (this was a few days after) and I said no. But then my parents and husband were talking and wanted to try and change my mind. They brought a list of pros to me on why our daughter should be Summer and I told them I disagreed with the list, they argued back and told me Summer deserves to be honored. I said my daughter deserves to live life as herself. Cael said she would still be able to and the name isn't that uncommon that my sister would be the only person to think of. My parents told me to think of what my sister would want and how I love my sister and miss her every day. For some reason that broke me. I started to cry out of nowhere and told the three of them I did not want to name my daughter after a sister I never knew. I'm not totally sure what happened directly after I was so upset. But Cael and my parents think I was cruel to say it like that.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682176665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v913g/aita_for_telling_my_parents_and_my_husband_that_i/", "score": 501, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not so sure why he\u2019s so bullish on the name since he doesn\u2019t have the same emotional investment, but he really shit the bed backing your parents here. Essentially he\u2019s saying he\u2019s okay with your feelings being diminished every day of your life and seeing you continue to play second fiddle, and passing that on to your child. I\u2019d ask him the following:\n\n- why is he so on board with this?\n- why is he okay with furthering your suffering?\n- why won\u2019t he support you?\n- why is he more concerned with the feelings of others than the feelings of his wife?\n\nThis is a big red flag. If he can be so easily swayed, I sincerely doubt he\u2019d be able to stand up for you in more dire circumstances. Your emotional health is important and he\u2019s okay with leaving you in your parents wake. \n\nYour parents are gonna be more straightforward. You can\u2019t trust your husband to back you here, so you\u2019ll need to find some gumption. Your husband be damned, tell them you\u2019ve chosen a name, that\u2019s the name, and it WILL NOT change. Any attempt to nickname or call your daughter any reference to your late sister and there will be hell to pay. Tell your parents your truth, your honesty, that they were shit to you and are STILL being shit to you. I empathize with their loss but the fact that they made their loss their entire personalities and never processed their grief should not impact a new generation. You suffered enough, and you\u2019re a good momma with good instincts for not allowing your daughter to suffer the same. Give them the choice: you and your daughter, or the memories of the one they lost and nothing else. No delivery room. No visits. They also need therapy to show that they\u2019re willing to work on themselves. This isn\u2019t about just a name, they haven\u2019t moved on. Everyone will continue to live with this stress if they don\u2019t work on this. \n\n\nCongrats on your little! You\u2019re gonna be a great mom cause you already are!!!!", "NTA- your daughter is NOT a replacement for the child they lost. Your parents need therapy, and should have gotten it long ago. I would be preparing for them to be consumed in your daughters life in a very unhealthy way, and to use GUILT to force their will on you. Start setting boundaries now, protect your daughter from living a life in the shadow of a corpse. \n\nAs for your husband he is being a AH, naming a child is a situation where both parents have to say yes( and ONLY the parents.) If one says no the answer is NO. Him pushing you is unacceptable, him doing it in front of your parents is disrespectful and cruel. I would be very cautious, and not allow him to fill out the birth certificate, because he has proven he will bully you to get his way.", "NTA but your husband is for disregarding your feelings on this. You need couples counseling if he pushes this. You lived your life in the shadow of your parents grief & your husband siding with them is 100% wrong. Your parents need grief counseling because they are going to continue to live in the past instead of celebrating a new generation and thinking of the future. I would sit down with them & tell them you will absolutely NOT be naming her after your sister and the minute they bring her up or compare your child to her you will be limiting contact with them.", "NTA. \n\nGiven your parents' obsession with their late daughter your child would not have her own identity. She'd constantly be compared to her even though your sister died at 5 weeks so they'd not really have anything to compare to. \n\nOr, if your daughter resembled Summer they'd basically try to live as though your daughter was theirs come back to life. If your daughter did not resemble Summer at all they'd be disappointed.\n\nPrince William said the reason they named their daughter Charlotte and not Diana as a first name was they wanted her to have her own identity, and not be constantly compared to an iconic grandmother she never knew.\n\nIt's too heavy of a burden for a child to carry all her life.", "NTA. I really don't understand why your husband is on board with this. Is he aware of how you have felt about having  Summer always casting a shadow over your life? If not, share this post with him.", "INFO: How long we\u2019re you with your  husband before you got married?\n\nI find it hard to believe he would side with your parents if he has seen this behavior come up again and again for years where they unsurreptitiously inserted Summer\u2019s existence into events not meant for her.\n\nAlso, IDK how someone can expect someone else to \u201cmiss\u201d someone they literally never knew\u2026who died two years before they were even born\u2026.that\u2019s all sorts of crazy.\n\nAdditionally, I just had to say this, based on the following statement:\n\n>When they'd meet new people Summer was the child they mentioned first, and the one they talked most about. Someone would ask what grade I was in or how old I was and they'd say Summer would be in fourth grade or Summer would have been 13 today. \n\nPeople were probably so confused. And many probably called OP, \"Summer\", because of this. I bet they got the shock of their life when they found out she wasn't Summer.", "NTA; also your husband needs to get on board and support you on this. If not, he is an asshole along with your parents", "NTA. It is extremely selfish for your parents to be so pushy on this.", "You are NTA, but you will be if you name this child after your dead sister - no nickname, no middle name, none of that BS. Your daughter will never measure up to the dead baby that never got to be a real person, and giving her the name in any form would be cruel to the living child you bring into the world. It will come with a heavy mantel of expectations. This is a hill to die on.", "NTA, good heavens. Your husband, though...  I think you should show him this post and the responses.\n\nIt's possible, even likely, that he means well. At any rate, it's clear he hasn't understood the impact that this has had on your life. But your post makes it very clear, so reading it might help him be more compassionate towards you, going forward.\n\nAs for your parents, I'm so sorry they've treated you like this. Their grief is more than natural; the way they've chosen to live with their grief less so.", "Nta\n\nWhat is wrong with your husband? You said no, it's a no. Naming children is 2 yes or it's a no.\n\n\nI don't understand how your husband could think it's a good idea. Did you ever discuss the heartache of feeling like the invisible child growing up with him?\n\nBecause if you have and he still jumped at the chance to agree with them, he is even a bigger jerk than I originally thought.", "NTA \nThe parents are being selfish but how could understand the husband not be on your side!?!?!?\nI agree that giving her that name would result in her not being able to live her life especially if she does things in the future that OP's parents are not okay with, they would care a lot more and such if name was summer as they would not expect their daughter to do this, so why can their granddaughter\nOP u are in the right\nMake this ur hill to die down", "NTA\n\n\nTell your parents flat out. You never knew or loved sUmmer and she was forced down your throat. You want your daughter to NOT suffer as they made you suffer in the shadow of the child they hsd thet never got to grow up. You do not want to enflict that trama on your child. This is a hill to die on and tell your husband If he cannot accept your trama and feeling he can kick rocks too. Your Daughter Is NOT a replacement for your lost sister. Show this to Husband", "NTA.  I completely agree with you, naming her Summer won't let her have a life of her own in the eyes of your parents.  To them, I would say, it's never too late for therapy because it seems like they still have a boatload of unresolved grief.\n\nIf I were you, I'd find out why your husband is so eager to ignore you and side with your parents.", "Absolutely NTA. Your parents should have got therapy early on. Your husband needs a reality check - Summer has dominated every aspect of your life. It isn't fair to pass that on to a new baby.", "NTA. I\u2019d be really concerned with your husband so readily disregarding the level of trauma that dealing with that as a kid created for you. People that doesn\u2019t experience can\u2019t fathom it. That name is connected to those bad memories and experiences. You will always be reminded of those bad memories when you hear that name. It could lead to resentment. I\u2019d expect your parents to try and be too heavily involved cause they\u2019d get a second chance with Summer.  It would happen all over again. Your parents are doing it by trying to get you to use the name. They don\u2019t care what you want or how it affected you. \n\nYou really need to make sure your husband understands how that affected you and the level of trauma that you still carry from it. I mean hell you broke from your parents and guilt too you back.

These people have clearly never loved you or even taken the time to get to know you. Yes, it was their grief that was interfering, but that doesn't excuse them from the terrible emotional neglect and abuse you have suffered because of it and are still suffering. \n\nGive your husband this post, and hopefully he will completely understand and will help you stand up to your parents.\n\nDo NOT use the name Summer in any way, shape, or form. No \"S\" names, etc. What your parents did to you your whole life is just awful and I hope you can get some therapy to help you come to terms with it and to help you go LC or NC with your parents.", "Hard NTA.  Kids are not living memorials to dead people.  Your parents clearly haven't processed their grief in a healthy way.  Your husband should be backing you up and it is concerning that he's not.", "Nta\nYou have the right to want your daughter to be her own person, and not live in the shadow of a person she\u2019ll never know.", "You\u2019re NTA. Even if you did know her, you might not want that for her name. I\u2019ve never understood burdening a child like that, either. Particularly when it\u2019s a life cut short. \n\nYour parents have beyond dropped the ball. In mourning their deceased daughter, they\u2019ve neglected the live one. But at least I understand their motivations. What the hell is your husband\u2019s? \n\nFind out why he\u2019s doing this. Then ask him why the hell, especially at this moment, you are not his very first priority.", ">My parents told me to think of what my sister would want\n\nYour sister would want??? She lived for five weeks two years before you were born. Her wanting anything in this context is impossible. Your parents have created a fictional perfect Summer from hope and dreams and grief that no real person would ever have been. Saddling your daughter with living up to that is a bad idea.\n\nBeyond counselling, maybe some kind of project that commemorates Summer's existence would help them channel their obsession in a better direction and distract them from trying to make your life about this sad event before you were even born. Raising funds for research into neonatal cancers perhaps or funds or facilities for other families going through this.\n\nNTA and congratulations on your daughter.", ">My parents told me to think of what my sister would want\n\nWith all due respect, your parents don't even know what she would have wanted. \nOnly what kind of personality they imagined for her as they never got to know her.

She was born with cancer and died when she was only 5 weeks old. I was born 2 years later and her memory was very strong throughout my life. My parents weren't great parents to me because they were still in very heavy grief and it made our relationship complicated. I remember they cried on her birthday every year and they also cried on most of mine and she was mentioned at every celebration. I remember for a while really wanting to hear more about her but at some point all the mentions of her were too much, it felt suffocating and I felt less important. When they'd meet new people Summer was the child they mentioned first, and the one they talked most about. Someone would ask what grade I was in or how old I was and they'd say Summer would be in fourth grade or Summer would have been 13 today. When I graduated high school I asked that my parents not to mention Summer during the celebration after (we had a dinner with family and a couple of my friends but not a full blown party) and they were so angry at me for wanting Summer forgotten. I took some time from them in college but was wracked with guilt and we ended up back in touch.\n\nI got married to my husband Cael last year and now we're expecting a girl. My parents brought up how amazing it would be for us to name our daughter Summer and my husband was 100% on board. He was pretty much agreeing before I had a chance to react. When I did talk to him he was shocked I had any doubts and was ready to go full steam ahead. I told him I wanted our daughter to have her own name and I didn't want her to carry the weight of the Summer who never got the chance to grow up, and so was all her grandparents really wanted to talk about. He said he understood but to think of how loved our daughter would feel. And he knows I think Summer is a beautiful name, because I do. But the history.\n\nI told my parents I wanted my daughter to have her own name and they cried. They didn't really comment. They then asked was I going to change my mind (this was a few days after) and I said no. But then my parents and husband were talking and wanted to try and change my mind. They brought a list of pros to me on why our daughter should be Summer and I told them I disagreed with the list, they argued back and told me Summer deserves to be honored. I said my daughter deserves to live life as herself. Cael said she would still be able to and the name isn't that uncommon that my sister would be the only person to think of. My parents told me to think of what my sister would want and how I love my sister and miss her every day. For some reason that broke me. I started to cry out of nowhere and told the three of them I did not want to name my daughter after a sister I never knew. I'm not totally sure what happened directly after I was so upset. But Cael and my parents think I was cruel to say it like that.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I get that people do this to honor others and that's fine.  But this is taking it to a weird extreme due to your parents being unable to let go for all these years.

That's a lot of weight, pressure, and responsibility she never asked for, and it would feel like a curse and punishment just for being born. Summer 2 still wouldn't be as important as Summer 1.

You need to be very clear with your husband and your parents.  They treated you horribly as a child.  They made your life all about their loss.

I know they do not want her to be forgotten, or pretend she never existed. But Lord God, they needed therapy. I\u2019d have a hard time being more than low contact with them after all the things you\u2019ve said. And I would have shut the name thing down. \n\n\u201cYou have one living daughter.

I couldn\u2019t imagine going through what your parents are going through but it\u2019s no excuse. As a parent I can\u2019t imagine ever losing my son but at the same time I couldn\u2019t imagine my son losing out on love because of one I lost. Also I think it\u2019s weird to name someone after someone who\u2019s passed.

Honestly I'd be seriously considering cutting them off again and also making clear to your husband that if he cannot support you in not naming your daughter Summer then maybe you shouldn't remain together.", "NTA. Thanks for standing up for your child because we can see her future as you were dealt with being the third wheel in their all consuming grief.

You know the life your daughter will live because you\u2019ve lived in your sisters shadow and all they are doing is casting it further onto her. Your parents are wrong regardless of their excuse of grief but your husband in all of this is the biggest issue for me. He has no grief and was your confidant and knows what you felt and experienced and is now choosing to dismiss and bully you along with you parents. Idk what his motives are but he is not acting in the best interest to of his wife and child in any capacity.", "NTA hold your ground but you can expect that your parents WILL nickname your daughter and call her \"summer\"", "Do not, do not give in on this. My parents named my sister after the daughter they lost, and it's damn near deztroyed her.", "NTA. At all. I think it would be good for your own sake to tell your parents why about don't want to name your daughter Summer.

He needs to understand that the baby won't be surrounded by love, they will carry the weight of living up to the fantasy that two out of control grieving parents have built for the last 20+ years of what their Summer would have been like. The baby will never be able to live up to their expectations of the perfect child who never cried and never failed. They will never be allowed to be their own person, they will always have to be Summer the dream.", "I would go so far as to say husband is disregarding her trauma on this. OP, Make sure hospital knows not to let him fill out any paperwork about your daughter", "And to those saying to \u201ccompromise\u201d and use Summer as a middle name, c\u2019mon.

They need to back off and OP\u2019s partner needs to support her. NTA.", "Completely agree, parents seem like habitual line steppers and would probably try to take over the role of parents so they could live out the dream of raising the \u201cSummer\u201d they never had.", "Agreed! IMO he is making a mistake here by  siding with your parents on this, but if he doesn\u2019t already know what Summer means to you (the clear favorite daughter whose memory was used at every turn to minimize your own life) vs your parents, or understand how naming your daughter this would likely put her in the exact same position, then I think it is probably worth telling him. It\u2019s possible that if he doesn\u2019t know, he might think that the name would simply be in honor & she\u2019d be allowed to live her own life, but knowing how her memory was held over your head your whole life, I think you\u2019re right that it\u2019s very likely they would do the same to her (and might still try to, regardless of name). I think most reasonable people would change their mind after hearing that. If he doubles down, then that\u2019s definitely an AH move imo. The only reasonable objection I can think rn of is \u201cThey might do that to her anyways, and naming her Summer could ease the brunt of that\u201d - which I could see, but I could also see it making it worse.\n\nLosing a child is supposed to be an enormous, horrendous grief, so I do feel for your parents. That said - our \u201cdemons\u201d may not be our fault, but we are responsible for how to handle them appropriately. Your parents *absolutely* did not do that, so I do think they\u2019re AHs here as well. You and your daughter are not an appropriate outlet for their pain, and I suspect they have inadvertently used Summer\u2019s memory to cause more pain than they eased.\n\nYou are NTA. I wish you & your daughter wonderful, long, happy & healthy lives. You\u2019ve got this - as someone else said, you are already being a great mom by protecting your child from this.", "I was with my husband for 3 years before and he was aware of everything.

So that has made all this far more complicated.", "And that OP never knew.", "Remove your parents from discussions about names. They don't get a vote.\n\nTell your husband privately that it's a boundary that he needs to help enforce. The only two opinions that matter are yours and his.\n\nIt's you and your husband, two yeses, one no. You've said no, he needs to respect that and move on. Continual revisiting of the issue is out of line.", "Even the parents barely knew Summer!

They want nothing to do with therapy.", "My thoughts exactly!", "They want nothing to do with therapy. That is something they are very clear about.", "He knows what my childhood was like. We have talked about it before as well as how it made me feel.", "They gave me a similar enough name. But I think at the time they probably worried what people would say/think. So they gave me a name that was close and maybe always planned for me to name a future child after my sister.", "Not for years but I did go to therapy in college. My name is actually very similar to Summer's already.", "I am sorry for y'alls loss. You and your wife are wise.", "Best answer here.\n\nBut i wouldn't go that easy on her parents. It isn't a recent loss where you really have to tiptoe around any longer.\nHer parents should be confronted by her of what they did to her. This was mental abuse, nothing less. They need to understand that they lost two daughters and the second loss is fully on them. They emotionally abandoned their second daughter.\n\nAs a father, even the thought of losing a child is beyond horrible. But they had a second daughter which needed love and attention and they refused to give the bare minimum of it.\n\nSo OP owes them absolutely nothing.", "No, there are absolutely assholes here, OP is the only one that's not. If she gives an inch by using it as a middle name, her parents will only call the child by the middle name. OP needs to shut this down, and if I were in her shoes, I'd go NC if they keep pushing it. They already made OP feel less than for most of her life, she should do everything she can to prevent the grandparents from doing it to her daughter too.", "Not the OP, but I feel as if that would still be pushing a boundary too far. It sucks when the Golden Child of the family is literally dead, and the living live in their shadow. That stuff brings real consequences like the resentment you mentioned. And it\u2019s not just resentment towards the sister, but to the parents, and to the sister\u2019s name due to them bringing it up. Why should OP have to resent her child\u2019s middle name for the rest of her life either?", "No, the parents are definitely assholes.  Their unwillingness to regulate their grief led to them emotionally neglected, and to some extent emotionally abusing, OP.  It is not abnormal to want things like birthdays and graduations to be about the person who\u2019s celebrating.  Attempting to manipulate OP into naming their child after a dead sibling is definitely an asshole move.", "This is a great idea, as Autumn occurs after Summer and is universally loved.", "This comment kicks ass.", "Ha, ha, that\u2019s funny!

Husband's reasoning is so weak that I'm sure the parents promised him inheritance and asked not to tell OP about the deal. It's the only possible reason why he can't give a straight answer why the name should be exactly what OP, the mother of his child, doesn't want. \n\nNTA.", "Yea, probably.", "That\u2019s better than my first guess which was that he regularly puts her feelings second and she didn\u2019t realize it til now because that\u2019s how she grew up.

I would wager OP was the intended replacement, but parents were still so deep in their grief they couldn\u2019t fully commit.

There was a post not long ago where the grandparents didn't like the name that was chosen, so they just decided to use the names they liked.", "Agreed.

I can't understand your husband's thought process unless there is money involved. \n\n\nIs that a possibility?", "That too!", "I\u2019m glad someone said it, as callous as it sounds it\u2019s true. Summer was grief incarnate and that trauma has been heavy looming over OP her entire life.", "This is not healthy, and I'm guessing regardless of whether or not you name her after your sister, your parents' behavior will only continue if not worsen. \n\nMy suggestions: \n\nFind out why your husband is siding with them. Set boundaries and hard limits that you both agree on, for before, during, and after you give birth. Counseling for the two of you on this might be helpful; have a neutral 3rd party to help mediate. Even if he doesn't want to go, you should if you are able. You are under enough stress on top of being pregnant, let them help you manage/navigate the mental mess of all this. \n\n\nAnd Definitely, consider going low contact or no contact with your parents. \n\nI cannot fault your parents for their grief; our child is named after my husband's late brother, and when I was pregnant there were a few concerns with my MIL. Her youngest son died due to a  congenital issue, her pain has never really gone away. \n\nBut how your parents are dealing with it is not healthy. For anyone involved. \nAre they possibly involved with a local church? Would reaching out to their pastor possibly help? If not, then this is definitely where LC/NC would definitely be needed for your peace of mind. \n\n\nWhen delivery time comes, please communicate with hospital staff about who is/is not allowed in the delivery room/visitors, etc. Grief makes people lose all rational thought, and there could be a risk of this sending them over the edge.", "I don't understand why you can not be stronger in this regard. Is there a monetary/inheritance issue? Is there a reason you can not distance yourself from this very unhealthy behavior on their part?", "So they are allowed to establish clear boundaries but you are not? What would you like to name your daughter?", "Then you realize that they never dealt with their grief. Instead they had a daughter, you to replace her with. They named you something similar and now expect you to play into their delusions. Your unwillingness to not speak to them about getting help means you have only one option. Cut them off.

They still could come around and have a good relationship moving forward if they can see the error of their ways and turn this around.", "The fact that the OP bothered to ask the question tells me that she does have concern for her parent's feelings.\n\nIt's possible to have hurt feelings AND to still deeply love somebody and care about what they feel.\n\nA compromise might be the healthiest thing for everyone in the long run.\n\nAfter all, feeling guilty for refusing might be something the OP might have to deal with later.", "*will never* have her own life, her own identity.
