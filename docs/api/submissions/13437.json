We had been friends for over 10 years and our relationship was good. They were the pretty blonde white girls who were so kind as to guide me through the school and defend me from bullies and racists.\n\nI have a very unusual ethnic mix and that made me an easy target (I'm Native Hawaiian and Arab). Naturally, I befriended the one other kid with an unusual ethnic mix, my best friend \"Andrew\" (M17), who is Azerbaijani and Chinese.\n\nWhen I hung out with Andrew after the pandemic ended, I noticed he'd leave my side once the twins came close to me. I found that very weird because those girls were known to be nothing but kind. When I asked why, he wouldn't talk to me about it.\n\nTheir father died in an accident earlier this year. This devastated the twins and I spent a lot of time helping them during the first week.\n\nOnce, Lisa was scrolling through her phone and had a sudden crying fit. Layla went to the bathroom with her to calm her down. I saw that Lisa had left her phone unlocked on the couch and I guess curiosity got the best of me.\n\nWell, I looked at her phone. She was on Instagram, as always, but as I scrolled down the chats I found a small group where I wasn't included. Curiosity got the best of me again. I checked it out, it was FULL of old messages about Andrew, how he \"brought covid to school\" and questions of \"has he ever eaten a dog?\". They even questioned how I managed to hang out with him.\n\nI was shocked and left the house immediately, not even bothering to close the chat as I left. I blocked them everywhere and when they came to my house I instructed my parents and siblings to not answer the door. I ignore them every time they see me in public and they have been crying on social media about how \"cruel\" I am being.\n\nI told Andrew everything and he said I was justified and thanked me for telling him. However, some of my other friends were calling me a bitch for looking through her phone and ignoring them like this while they was grieving. Idk if I'll ever talk to them anytime soon.\n\nAITA?\n\nINFO: I had asked them multiple times why Andrew was avoiding them. They'd giggle and not tell me anything and that caused some suspicion", "created_utc": 1680039081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12532ig/aita_for_ignoring_my_friends_during_their/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Snooping through someone's phone shouldn't happen though. I'm sure there were way more red flags about their behavior that would've told you they were racists without going through their phone though.", "Yes, going through someone's phone is really bad, but are they the worst!\n\nBesides racist, they are also so ignorant it hurts reading about it.\n\nYou are definitely NTA for cutting the contact with them even if they're grieving now, but you were a little the AH for snooping", "NTA - While you were definitely wrong for snooping through their phone, it seems clear they were hiding being racist from you. You were absolutely justified and your only fault is you invaded their privacy but then again, if you hadn\u2019t, you may have never found out who they really were.", "Ehh, NTA for how you reacted but you went snooping and getting hurt or offended when you've gone snooping through private messages that you KNEW you weren't a part of is a real AH move.", "NTA. They know exactly why you're ignoring them and they deserve it, grieving or not.", "Looking through their phone was bad but Atleast u know they\u2019re fake", "I feel like everyone sucks here. You shouldn\u2019t have gone through someone\u2019s phone since it\u2019s their privacy you are invading . No one enjoys having people going through their stuff. But I do understand after finding out that their comments about your friend is very cruel and discriminatory of them to do. They are assholes for that.", "ESH. Look, they're awful, but \"curiosity got the best of me\" is such a played out excuse for doing things you know you're not supposed to do", "NTA it sucks they\u2019re grieving but that being used against you for what you saw is just wrong. Yep seperate scenarios", "ESH.  Snooping through a phone makes you an AH.  Your reaction to the info you discovered does not.", "ESH - you\u2019re the asshole for going through their phone and they are the assholes for being racist idiots. You are not an asshole for not being friends with them anymore. It seems that\u2019s who they are. You also aren\u2019t the asshole for distancing yourself from RACISTS while they grieve. Their grief is their issue, not yours. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they start saying racist things about you now. Clearly Andrew has been at the bad end. It seems he enjoyed your friendship but never brought it up out of fear that you wouldn\u2019t believe him and stop being his friends or it would cause them to retaliate more. Respect people\u2019s privacy. There was nothing that justifies you going through their stuff", "ESH - You should not have looking to someone's phone without permission \nThe girls are racist \nYour friend should have tell about what happened sooner", "You should never snoop in someone else's phone, but you discovered racism against your friend...\n\n\nSligh ESH, like 80/20 ESH/NTA.\n\n\nSorry for their loss but racism is a strict no-no zone.", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH. \nYou, for going through someone\u2019s phone for apparently no reason other than \u2018curiosity\u2019.\nThem for participating in such disgusting behavior. \nI do wonder though, were both twins involved in the group chat? \nWhy are they so racist towards Andrew, but never to you? \n\nThat being said, you\u2019re well within your right to not be friends with people who hold such views, so don\u2019t let anyone try to guilt you about that. Being in the midst of grief or not, no one ever HAS to remain friends with someone. But I think instead of simply ignoring them, it may be worthwhile to tell them what you\u2019re feeling. That you were hurt they\u2019d participate in such discussions, or remain friends with people who would (if they were being \u2018background observers\u2019 to the chat). That it changed the way you see them and any semblance of care has been shattered. You are not their friend any longer and to leave you alone.\nBut you\u2019re all young, and sometimes kids cave to peer pressure. It of course doesn\u2019t forgive what they did, but it is possible their other friends were very outspoken about their racism and the twins were cowards who feared losing so many people, even if those people are terrible humans. \nI\u2019d be curious to see why Andrew avoided them so much, as perhaps they bully him when you aren\u2019t around and peer pressure wasn\u2019t involved at all. Maybe you can ask him to explain, now that you know how they are, and see if he can shed some light for you about things.", "YTA for going through the personal messages of someone who was at that moment, someone you considered a close friend. I can't necessarily blame you though for not wanting to talk to them past that. Before that though you were straight up snooping where you should not have been", "YTA. Just exactly how entitled are you to think you have a right to look through someone else's phone and read their private messages? Curiosity got the better of you? Give me a break, you're just someone who doesn't respect another's privacy and this was done with malicious intent. Cut out the holier than thou act, you're no better than anyone else.", "Absolutely YTA for looking in her phone. You invaded her privacy, and THAT IS NOT DONE.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
