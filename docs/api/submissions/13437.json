Being in the midst of grief or not, no one ever HAS to remain friends with someone. But I think instead of simply ignoring them, it may be worthwhile to tell them what you\u2019re feeling. That you were hurt they\u2019d participate in such discussions, or remain friends with people who would (if they were being \u2018background observers\u2019 to the chat).

It of course doesn\u2019t forgive what they did, but it is possible their other friends were very outspoken about their racism and the twins were cowards who feared losing so many people, even if those people are terrible humans. \nI\u2019d be curious to see why Andrew avoided them so much, as perhaps they bully him when you aren\u2019t around and peer pressure wasn\u2019t involved at all.

If you didn't want to answer a question for whatever reason does that give the person you're talking to the right to look through your phone for answers? No. If they had a gut feeling you were lying about something, is their subjective feeling enough reason to snoop? I didn't read anything there that pointed to wrongdoing before the snooping, but idk maybe there's something OP left out. Even if they were lying, and the giggling hinted at that, there wasn't an indication that it was something serious enough that required snooping. \n\nAlso you seem to focus on the fact that she was right. Whether she's right doesn't matter for this. You don't justify an action by its results. Justification for a decision has to come from something before the decision, not after. Her justification was a gut feeling. And I don't think that's enough."]}
