I don\u2019t want to do it anymore, though. \n\nWe both got hired on at a job at the same time, and we hit it off right away. She even said she expected us to become best friends quickly. And we did. When we talked more, I discovered she didn\u2019t have a car and would ask friends and family for rides or just pay for Lyfts to get to work. I knew it cost her a lot of money on top of the bills she already had, so I offered to drive her instead. She lives on the way to the job from my house, so it just made since for me to make a small detour and pick her up in the mornings. She agreed to give me $20 each week for gas or snacks, which was WAY less than she was paying for a single ride through Lyft. No biggie. That is until I quit. \n\nTo be fair, I told her I understood my quitting would put her in a really bad situation since she depended on me to get her to work. So, I agreed to keep taking her, which would allow us to still hangout, too. But here lately, I\u2019ve been getting really poor sleep and not waking up on time. It\u2019s caused me to be late a bunch this last week. I actually slept through an alarm yesterday for the first time in a while. \n\nWhen I woke up and realized the time, I called her in a panic and apologized profusely. I told her I didn\u2019t know what happened just that I somehow didn\u2019t wake up on time, and I could rush over and grab her if she didn\u2019t already have other means of getting to work. She became very short with me and said the phrase \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u201d quite a few times in our conversation before ending the call. \n\nI totally understand being upset in that moment. You expect your ride to be there, and it didn\u2019t show. I GET IT. But she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since Friday morning when it happened, and she\u2019s not responding to anything I\u2019ve sent her on TikTok like she usually does. Now I\u2019m wondering how she can be this mad at me when I have basically been doing her a favor.\n\nOh yeah. I forgot to mention. That $20 a week - it\u2019s only happened a handful of times, maybe, since July. It\u2019s now the first few days of November. At this point she should have given me about $300 for all of the weeks I have driven her. I actually just checked my transaction with her on Cash App, and found out she\u2019s only sent me $120. That leaves $180 that I\u2019m still owed, and she\u2019s probably going to tag another $20 on it this week.\n\nI also don\u2019t appreciate how a lot of the time she gets in the car and is constantly on her phone with someone. Sometimes, she doesn\u2019t even speak to me until we get to her job or back to her house, and it\u2019s usually only long enough to say goodbye. So not only am I giving you heavily discounted, if not free rides, I\u2019m also your impromptu chauffeur. Great. So much for hanging out.\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to take my friend to work anymore?", "created_utc": 1699166630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17o66xm/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_my_friend_to_work/", "score": 27, "replies": ["NTA. Between her not paying and you having trouble being on time, it's definitely time for the rides to end.\n\nIf you want to you could offer to start again once she's paid you the $180 she owes, in which case you should also work out what to do about any tardiness - do you text her when you wake up every morning so she can make alternative plans if she doesn't get the text? do you refund her x amount if you're late? (I'd let the phone use go, forcing her to hang out won't result in quality hang-outs.) But, this is only if you want to keep helping. You don't have to.", "NTA you don't even work there anymore and 20 dollars at the prices of gas these days no not worth it! Also she's not your friend you not really hanging out your giving her a ride which is what 20 mins? There's really not much you can hang out in that time she's had too long of a time to find a new ride. She needs to be an adult and figure it out", "Nta. You offered a favor out of convenience, and it's not anymore so you can stop. Also, she started taking advantage of the situation and owes you money.", "NTA. This should've stopped when you quit, at the latest. She is very much taking advantage of you.\n\nTell her the gravy train's over. She isn't your friend anyway, sorry.", "Nta. You've been doing her a favor for a long time and they can't even pay you a small amount of gas money. On top of that it's disrupting your own life", "NTA OP.  It\u2019s clear that you aren\u2019t a priority for her anymore, so why should you make time to take her to a job where you don\u2019t even work anymore?", "NTA. She's not your friend, you're her chauffeur.", "No wonder you feel resentful- she is absolutely using you for your car. Tell her that you can't take her to work anymore- see how quickly the calls/texts stop. Don't feel bad- it's too much for you, she can use the money she's saved to pay for her cabs; plus you are in no way responsible for how she gets to work. NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t work there anymore so it\u2019s not convenient for you to take her. End of story. She can figure it out herself.", "NTA. This \u201cfriend\u201d is merely using you. Since you no longer work for the same company, there really is no point for you to be doing this favor especially since she\u2019s also not updated on your agreed payment scheme.", "NTA End the free ride this minute. If she doesn't contact you for any non-ride reason, the friendship was never real. Sorry. She sounds awful. You seem very generous.", "you know someone called Pineapple?", "NTA.  She's been using you from the sound of things and knew you'd quit so an end to hit gravy train was only natural.  I'm shocked you let her treat you like a doormat for this long unless you were hoping the golden retriever vibe would lead to romance", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And it sounds like she just considers you useful not a friend.", "She owes you money and a big apology, NTA. If she doesn't apologize when you tell her you have to stop, I might just put her on the backburner.", "Nta but now you have a way out if she's being short with you. Slow fade her. It sounds like she's just using you anyways", "NTA. After reading the last bit about her being on her phone and not even really conversing with you, coupled with the fact that she hasn't paid you like she said she would really gives the impression of her taking advantage of you. I would just tell her you thought you could keep giving her rides but as it turns out, it's negatively affecting your new schedule and you just can't do it anymore. If she doesn't understand then she's not a real friend. You were doing her a pretty big favor. She should be grateful even if you were late once.", "NTA, she\u2019s taking advantage. Frankly, the rides should have stopped when the job did. A real friend wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable with that.", "NTA\n\nyou dont work there anymore. you are not her dad. find a new friend. she is obviously just using you", "NTA and you win Reddit today for best fake name \ud83d\ude05\n\nI would have been wary of her as soon as she told me she expects we'll be best friends. But I'm old and jaded. \n\nAnyways, she hasn't been paying you, now you don't even work there anymore and it's out of your way too pick her up, your exhausted, she's late for work. And she isn't even move to you when she rides with you, so there goes that motivation. This arrangement is no longer working out.", "NTA. You need to talk to her right away to tell her you aren't doing it any more.", "Dude stop taking her to work. Shes not respecting the deal you made so shes basically using you. If you somehow think this would help develop your relationship into something more intimate your fooling yourself. Have more respect for your time. She obviously doesnt. Move on bro.", "NTA take her not speaking as a sign to cut ties and run", "Unfortunately the arrangement no longer suits you, as you no longer work together. You need to politely inform her of that. Give her a week\u2019s notice if you want to, but let her know she will need to make other arrangements moving forward.\n\nNTA. And if she offers you back payment, take it and don\u2019t feel guilty. She owes you.", "NTA", "Haven't you realized that you stopped being friends once you quit the job, at least in her mind? Now you have to get it in your head to put yourself first and remove people who use you from your life. \n\nNTA. You don't work there, she doesn't talk with you, and she isn't paying you to be her chauffeur. How much more of a losing proposition will it take for you to wake up? Does she have to physically abuse you as well? Now you are online getting abused from strangers. I think you might need help with your self esteem.", "She's using you. Time to be assertive and end the free rides.", "OP do you have romantic feelings for this girl?", "YTA for continuing to drive her to work after you QUIT. I don't even understand it.", "\nPineapple Express has run its course.", "ESH, but mostly her.\n\nShe's not your friend. She's a user who has known what she was doing from the beginning. She's pretending to be your friend to get the friend discount. When you tell her you need the money she owes you, she will make excuses and tell you that you're supposed to be her friend.\n\nBut this relationship ran its course long ago and you didn't take the signs to heart. It's never cool to screw people over by not being where you said you would, and you didn't tell her that she needed to arrange a different ride. \"Obviously I am struggling in the morning, you should get a reliable ride,\" would have been enough.\n\nDo yourself a favor and stand up for yourself. Learn to say No and not give in. Learn how to tell a mooch from a friend.", "NTA for stopping the lifts, but you sure are the AH to yourself. You are allowing this person to treat you like a mug. Message her right now and say you will no longer be providing her any lifts to work or anywhere else, do not issue an apology or any explanation in the text, after that, do not respond to any messages. This isn\u2019t a friend", "Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t want to start taking her again even if I somehow got that money out of her. As far as the phone part goes, it\u2019s not really about forcing a hangout so much as it\u2019s kind of inconsiderate to not even say \u201cHi\u201d or \u201cGood Morning\u201d when you get in the car. Like I said, I feel like a chauffeur, the help, that sort of thing. It just sucks because that\u2019s pretty much all I ever see of her anymore.", "Fake name just in case she sees this and does the math lol Would\u2019t that be fun though?", "Yeah, if we look at this as an exchange of goods and services, she hasn't held up her end of the exchange, and if we look at this as you helping her save time and money as a favor, she sure hasn't been appreciative of it and considerate to you in return. She's 100% TA.", "Bro, you're allowed to just.. Stop. You're just a taxi to her at this point.", "ah! fair enough, yes it would! Though I think unless she's a complete moron she might figure it out anyway... You're not the asshole by the way. Tell her how it is, if she's a true friend she'll understand, if she doesn't then you've lost nothing.", "NTA.\n\n'Friends for a reason, friends for a season, friends for life' is something my mother said. You and Pineapple were 'for a reason'-you worked together, you hit it off and you did something nice for her. The reason is now gone and so is the temporary friendship. Tell her you can't help her out anymore.", "Not a taxi. You have to pay for a taxi. Pineapple is an entitled moocher. Tell her the free rides are over and block her.", "An underpaid taxi\u2026she should have been giving you at least $50 a week, when you were working there. Now that you\u2019re not working there, it should be at least $75/week. That\u2019s still a bargain compared to a Lyft or taxi."]}
