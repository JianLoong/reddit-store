Prior to making this decision, my father gave us money to go towards the wedding and deposit of the venue. However, now he wants the full amount back.\n\nMy father has never believed in spending lots of money on a wedding which I respect. I also understand that nobody is obligated or expected to give us money towards a wedding. So we were really grateful for my father\u2019s generosity and we were still planning on using that money to get married and throw a celebratory dinner with our closest family. \n\nA little bit of context on my dad: He has always been very stingy with his money. He would only send $200 to my mom a month for me and my sister after they got divorced (my mom never took him to court for child support). He\u2019s upper middle class with a big 5,000sq ft house. A house that has been paid off for years. All his kids, with the exception of one, have moved out of the house so realistically he only needs to provide for one child. Most of his kids have some sort of strained relationship with him. I\u2019m his first daughter and the only one who\u2019s been the most amicable with him throughout the years.\n\nHis reason for wanting the money back is that he has expenses and \u201cis dipping into his savings\u201d but when I asked him if he would\u2019ve asked for the money back if we were still having the big wedding, he said \u201cNo I wouldn\u2019t have asked for the money back. But if it was really my choice I wouldn\u2019t give a single penny for the wedding.\u201d Which is weird because I never forced him to give me anything to begin with.\n\nSo now if I invite him to our intimate ceremony (along with his wife and my younger half-sister), I can picture him wanting to walk me down the aisle, eating and laughing at the dinner he didn\u2019t help pay for, giving a toast to how much he loves his daughter and new son-in-law, acting like he didn\u2019t just completely screw us over. But if I don\u2019t invite him, I feel like things would be super awkward and weird with that side of the family.\n\nTLDR: my dad gave us money towards a big wedding. We decided we no longer want a big wedding and choose to do something more intimate with close family instead. Now he wants his money back. WIBTA for not inviting him to the wedding?\n\nEDIT: Damn a lot of people saying I\u2019m pocketing the money is crazy! But fair assumption since I didn\u2019t go into full details on how the money would be spent. The money that my father offered would ALL be used for the small wedding we\u2019re still planning to have which still costs money... (money that my finance and I are spending as well. No way I\u2019m expecting my father to pay for everything and that was never the case). He is fully aware of the costs of the new wedding plans. Yet he still wants all his money back. It\u2019s been really interesting to see everyone\u2019s perspective so thanks for all the responses! \n\nEdit 2: people are being hung up on the amount he offered vs the amount of both weddings. The original wedding with 180 guests would\u2019ve cost us close to 80k. What we\u2019re doing now is 20k. Dad offered $10k for the first wedding.
