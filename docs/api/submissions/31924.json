{"id": 31924, "submission_id": "18619y5", "title": "WIBTA for not inviting my father to my wedding after he requested his money back", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 (30m) and I (32f) were planning a big wedding next year but we decided recently that we no longer want to spend the crazy amount of money it would take, and instead choose to  have a very small ceremony with with our immediate family. Prior to making this decision, my father gave us money to go towards the wedding and deposit of the venue. However, now he wants the full amount back.\n\nMy father has never believed in spending lots of money on a wedding which I respect. I also understand that nobody is obligated or expected to give us money towards a wedding. So we were really grateful for my father\u2019s generosity and we were still planning on using that money to get married and throw a celebratory dinner with our closest family. \n\nA little bit of context on my dad: He has always been very stingy with his money. He would only send $200 to my mom a month for me and my sister after they got divorced (my mom never took him to court for child support). He\u2019s upper middle class with a big 5,000sq ft house. A house that has been paid off for years. All his kids, with the exception of one, have moved out of the house so realistically he only needs to provide for one child. Most of his kids have some sort of strained relationship with him. I\u2019m his first daughter and the only one who\u2019s been the most amicable with him throughout the years.\n\nHis reason for wanting the money back is that he has expenses and \u201cis dipping into his savings\u201d but when I asked him if he would\u2019ve asked for the money back if we were still having the big wedding, he said \u201cNo I wouldn\u2019t have asked for the money back. But if it was really my choice I wouldn\u2019t give a single penny for the wedding.\u201d Which is weird because I never forced him to give me anything to begin with.\n\nSo now if I invite him to our intimate ceremony (along with his wife and my younger half-sister), I can picture him wanting to walk me down the aisle, eating and laughing at the dinner he didn\u2019t help pay for, giving a toast to how much he loves his daughter and new son-in-law, acting like he didn\u2019t just completely screw us over. But if I don\u2019t invite him, I feel like things would be super awkward and weird with that side of the family.\n\nTLDR: my dad gave us money towards a big wedding. We decided we no longer want a big wedding and choose to do something more intimate with close family instead. Now he wants his money back.

Did you ask him why?\n\nDoes he have the perception that you didn\u2019t need his money since your plans changed? Does he understand how this will financially impact you?

I think YTA. He gave you wedding money specifically? Rather than \u2018my gift to you as you start married life\u2019 money I mean. There is a difference between the two.

So that was awesome. Then you decided that you didn't want to do the thing. So naturally he would want his money back. He didn't offer your money for anything. He offered you money for a *particular* thing that you decided not to do. **He did not screw you over.** \n\nAnd as a result of his awesome gesture, you now want to punish him? I mean, your wedding, so you have the right to do what you want, but this feels like an asshole move to me.", "YTA\n\nThis reads like your father gave you money to buy a Rolls Royce, but you decided to get a Toyota Corolla and just pocket the rest of the money. \n\nYou tremendously scaled back your original plan that your dad funded and now you\u2019re pissed he wants his money back? And - to make it 10x worse - you\u2019re disinviting him because YOU changed everything!\n\nAnd your reasoning for not inviting him are:\n\n1. He wants to walk you down the aisle. *JFC - he\u2019s your dad - that\u2019s a reasonable expectation.*\n\n2. He\u2019ll make a toast to how he loves his daughter and new son-in-law. *I would certainly hope so.*\n\n3.

Wtf does that have to do with anything beyond implying he has money, why can\u2019t he just give it to me? What an awful mindset.\n\nYou say you understand that nobody is obligated or expected to give you money towards a wedding, but you want to disinvite your own father precisely because he doesn\u2019t want to give you money. That sure sounds like you think he\u2019s obligated and expected to give you money.", "YTA. Why do you need his money if you're no longer having the wedding he was paying for?

Selfish and self-centered, but it is his money.\n\nIf you have a strained relationship with him, and you only want him at your wedding if he is giving you tens of thousands of dollars to do with as you wish, then you are just as selfish and self-centered as him, but worse because it's not your money.\n\nThe answer here is a do-over.  Give him the money back and forget it existed.  Now plan your wedding knowing you are paying for it yourselves, and decide whether you want your father walking you down the aisle.

So your decision was financial, yet you don't have any sympathy for him having financial issues of his own? \n\nClearly your overall relationship with him is far from ideal (**re-read that 2nd-to-last paragraph**), so it's asshole behaviour that you even took his money in the first place.

You could compromise and give him some of the money back and keep enough to pay for the small wedding, but I would still invite dad only because I believe there is a lack of communication here from the very beginning when you took the money.\nAlso, don\u2019t accept anymore money from your dad unless you have the terms in writing.", "Your dad is weird.\n\nIt isn\u2019t like you are having a cost free wedding, right?

He will spend time in the corner of the church/restaurant /wherever, bitching about how you keep coming after him for money for things (that\u2019s what my FIL did when my SIL got married. Quietly.  It was eye roll worthy). My spouse(boyfriend at the time) was so embarrassed.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, no one really buys into bitching.Either have him there or not.

Either way, you should give the money back and avoid that headache.\n\nAs far as not inviting him, that decision is up to you. You say your other siblings all have strained relationships with him, seems like some sort of pattern is going on with negative behavior. Regardless of what you choose, do what you feel is right for *you and your partner* to enjoy your day and look back with no regrets of how it went.

My home isn't as big as your dad's, but it's paid for and still I spend of $1000 a month to cover taxes and insurance (not to mention upkeep). You may not know your dad's true finances. But, regardless, it is his money to spend or not.  He clearly stepped out of his comfort zone to help with a big wedding that he didn't see as necessary, yet he did it.
