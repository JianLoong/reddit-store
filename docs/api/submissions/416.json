{"id": 416, "submission_id": "yhldmn", "title": "AITA - bfs mom holding hands with him throughout dinner under the table and I told him I thought it was strange", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend Steve for almost 1yr now. He came from a broken home as I, and many of us have.\n\nSteve\u2019s dad was apparently a dickhead to his mom and created all sorts of issues - I say \u201capparently\u201d because his dad has NEVER spoken on the issue so I give the whole \u201ctwo sides to every story\u201d a bit of respect here.\n\nWhat I have seen is his mom being a bit weird since we\u2019ve been together. I\u2019ve had my share of really bad (obnoxious bad) potential MILs in the past so I thanked all the gods that every religion has to offer when I got this meek, agreeable lovely seeming lady for my new potential MIL.\n\nSo we went to a nice dinner to \u201cmeet our families\u201d as we\u2019ve started to get serious & have moved in together. I had my mom and my grandmom there. Doris came obv but her partner of 20yr. Roy didn\u2019t come - no explanation was given.\n\nSteve\u2019s Family breakup backstory: Doris broke up with Frank (Steve\u2019s dad) when Steve was 12 and Doris decided to leave Frank to be with Roy. Roy then left his wife and kids to be with her. His kids went to the same school with Steve, one being in his class &this is in a VERY small town, so i can only imagine what the kids felt going to school with someone whose mum they perceived (and still do) as \u201cruining their family\u201d. Never the less I felt anger at Frank by hurting Doris and \u201cforcing her to leave\u201d. \n\nAnyway back to the dinner.. we all take our seats, start reading the menu. I look to see if Steve / Doris have made a decision and she\u2019s staring at him smiling and nodding? A min later I go to get my phone and I see she\u2019s holding his hand under the table???\n\nI haven\u2019t been in a relationship for a while but\u2026this isn\u2019t normal is it? I don\u2019t know what to think. Do I mention this to him?? I said it to my mom and she said not to get involved? It just doesn\u2019t sit right.\n\nFrom advice, I spoke to him, I said It made me uncomfortable as even when we sat there ordering she was just in a trance almost smiling at him and he ignored it was happening. I said I also didn\u2019t have that kind of closeness to my mum which may be why I find it so strange. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t even a second later that he got OUTRAGOUSLY MAD. He was calling me a c***, he said \u201chis mom is the nicest best person in the world\u201d he said his mom is a saint and has never done anything wrong. and he\u2019s gone to sleep in spare bed. I feel really bad now. \n\nI also didn\u2019t mention above a huge point which came to me when I was talking to him/trying to make him calm down.. his mom calls and texts him every day/night, sometimes crying because she\u2019s depressed and had a problem at work. I feel sad for her and he cares so much because on more than one occasion he\u2019s visibly upset because his moms sad. He grew up in a very small town and has since lived in the city (about an hour plane trip/14(?) hour drive. \n\nHe also has a younger sister (22F) but Doris chooses not to talk to her because apparently her daughter tells her bluntly how it is and Doris doesn\u2019t like it (she has said the sister is exactly like the dad and that\u2019s why her and my bf have a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d.\n\nSo AITA for bringing this up and telling him I thought it was strange? I\u2019m not generally a confrontational person and it was against all sorts to muster courage to bring this up to him\u2026 but now I feel awful.
