She didn't communicate. You would have cancelled the service had she texted you an accurate time. And yes, emergencies happen. But this one was *hers*. The screenshot was from *that* client's emergency. Does she not understand how emergencies work? The person who cancels/is late/skips/etc eats the price. Not sure why you're supposed to be on the hook when she was the one who was late and failed to provide adequate updates. I would probably look for a new service also because this is weird to me.\n\nIf you live somewhere where she wasn't going to eat if she didn't get paid, then the way to do it was probably to pay her now in return for a free cleaning another day. But paying her for a cleaning she didn't show up to do isn't a thing, imho.", "NTA \n\nShe could have taken the 2 minutes (or less) to text you with updates. That's on her.", "Yeah, NTA. She could have communicated that and she didn't. That is on her not you. Even when she did communicate it wasn't accurate. I'd also be firing her if she expected to be paid for doing nothing AND being late.", "NTA - the other fam offered her compensation because of their emergency, not because of the cleaner not showing up as agreed. Maybe be clear when you have a hard stop on your schedule. We let our cleaners know if there is a hard window and they work around or let us know if it doesn\u2019t work", "NTA-if you had to reschedule at the last minute, I could understand her asking for payment. But since she was the one who essentially canceled, she isn\u2019t entitled to compensation.", "\"I'm sorry, but my fee for a no-show within the specified time frame is $200, unless you called during that window to reschedule.\" \n\nMy time is valuable too.", "NTA \n\nYou offered to reschedule so you could pay her at that time \n\nApparently she\u2019s declining to reschedule?? \n\nThat\u2019s on her", "NTA\n\n> She responds back with \"I know I was late, but delays happen sometimes the houses are dirtier and I need more time. however my clients never cancel with me at the last minute because they have a schedule to follow and expenses to pay, I can't get another house in place at the last minute.\"\n\nNothing she said here makes any sense.\n\n1. If she was delayed because she had to spend extra time cleaning someone else's house, she should charge the previous client for the extra time, not you.\n2. You didn't cancel on her. She cancelled on you by not showing up during the agreed upon time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She also didn\u2019t arrive to your house during your agreed upon time. You didn\u2019t cancel last minute. You asked to reschedule 45 minutes (really 1hr 45m) after she was supposed to arrive. Delays happen, but she didn\u2019t communicate any of them. She only responded when you texted her. If never contacted her, who knows when she would have showed up, if ever? It\u2019s bad enough that she\u2019s angry at you for asking to reschedule, but to also demand you pay her is totally unreasonable.", "She was late to her own schedule, didn't tell you. You didn't cancel on her, she canceled on you. You just gave her a small window of leeway.", "NTA!! Sorry you're not Bill Gates-rich enough to pay people for services they don't provide but it's not your problem. The audacity of her to show you a client's cancellation and expect you to pay for her own cancellation. Personally I would leave reviews too. You had another engagement, she wasn't answering, couldn't even give you common courtesy to answer but instead of offering a rescheduling or discount she tried to guilt you into just giving her cash for free. Screw that.", "NTA \n\nYou are in the right.\n\nHow badly do you want to keep her?", "Info: why do you not have (or want?) a contract that stipulates what happens in cases like this?", "Why did you have to be there for the house cleaning? Do you not trust her in the house alone? We always leave so they can handle their business. You should have left for your engagement and come home to a clean house.

Meaning that if I don't pay a cleaner, they may not be able to get a dinner that day.\n\nIn such case, I'd offer a solution such as \"I pay you now, and you squeeze me in later free of charge\" (that's actually what my cleaner would have offered me) or just pay depending on the situation (eg I just paid my cleaner when she got stuck in a hospital with her sick husband). I'd also pay them if I absolutely can't have them at my place for any reason on my side \n\nI'd probably fire them if they keep doing this with no communication though, but till they are fired, I'd probably pay.", "That's true.

In fact I said to her we're going to have to reschedule when it was more than 40m late without any sign of her arrival,, and she responded back the way she did, defensively without any compromise. I would pay her if she does the work, she's not a salaried employee.", "Just weird to me. I've never been home and leave them to do their job without the anxiety of being watched while working.", "Until something is missing, as in possibly stolen. .....", "That\u2019s why I have a house cleaner who is bonded, licensed, and insured.
