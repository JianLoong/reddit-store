Try to be blunt about this if it ever comes up again. If asked about why you won't chip in, say you don't like the bride. If you're told you're a loser for not being invited, say you wouldn't go even if you were invited. Bullies count on you being polite while they aren't. So don't feel like you need to be polite to them.", "NTA. I hate this forced gifting thing. If I want to give someone a gift I will.

To legally qualify as a hostile work environment, any harassment has to be based on a protected class, and it has to be either pervasive (minor to moderate incidents, but happening often), egregious (one or two things that are really bad), or some combination of the two. It\u2019s based on what a hypothetical \u201creasonable person\u201d would find to be too much, not what the specific affected employee thinks.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that people should have to put up with jerk bosses or coworkers, just that you can\u2019t sue one for creating a hostile work environment unless, for example, they\u2019re consistently being a bigger jerk to members of a protected class (refusing to promote people of color, or hitting on their female employees, etc.).", "Nah, I would cut out a coupon for a random thing and give that as my gift.

There are no legal standards that govern workplace civility.\n\n>However, there are some exceptions. For example, what if someone\u2019s hostility is directed only toward women or people of a certain race? That sort of behavior may create a hostile work environment and in some cases, it may be unlawful.\n\nThere's also a hyperlink to another page that, again doesn't really agree with your analysis:\n\nhttps://www.schwartzandperry.com/employment-law/hostile-work-environment/", "We spoke to them and told them to stop\n\nCue more bullying", "Unfortunately hostile workplace has a definition, and this doesn't fit it.  I'm not sure what HR could really do without a long list of things to consider that risk the company by keeping that person employed.  Sadly, being bullied in this sort of way or made uncomfortable like this usually isn't something HR is going to consider acting on, that's what direct management is for.", "But cut in fourths.", "It was an example. What is or is not considered a hostile work environment depends on a few things. 1) How the person feels. 2) The local laws 3) Company policies.  \n\n\nIn the state of California, a hostile work environment is legally defined as inappropriate conduct in the place of work that is either severe or pervasive enough to create an abusive work environment for at least one (or more) employees. Allowing / not instantly putting an end to the occurrence of a hostile workplace is unlawful, as specified by the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), a California law passed in 1959 to combat sexual harassment and other types of unlawful discrimination in employment and housing.  \n\n\nIn Nevada however, it's only considered hostile if the harassment is against a protected class.  \n\n\nHowever, I know of no work environment where the comments the woman made would be acceptable. If OP reports her and they do not address the issue, they may have grounds for a legal suit, again, depending on local laws. She wasn't just rude and abrasive. She was insulting, condescending, and is considered harassment. I work for the largest software company in the world and behavior like that is NOT tolerated and would land them a suspension at my job, at any job I have ever held in my 25+ years of working.   \nA supervisor at an old job (FedEx) I had was fired over such behavior that he made me the target of all because I asked the hub manager if I was needed to stay past my 8's as my supervisor tended to be late.  \n\n\nAny employer that tolerates that kind of behavior is NOT someone to work for.", "I think you've misunderstood what constitutes a hostile work environment in California.
