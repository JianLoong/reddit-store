They are harassing you for money now. NTA. \n\nALSO if you aren\u2019t invited to the wedding you don\u2019t send a gift. Who tf expects that?!?", "NTA", "NTA - I would report this to HR for the comment she made and for the attempted shake down.", "NTA - go take a huge poo and with a big smile tell her you have a special present you made her and you want to show it to her privately in the bathroom. She will clutch her pearls and probably cuss at you. Quickly flush . Then it\u2019s her word against yours.", "NTA. They honestly all sound terrible, but in fact it's not expected that someone not invited to the wedding would get the couple a gift.", "NTA", "Why did you even bother going to the luncheon?", "NTA. You are not friends, you are obligated to give money. Gifts are just that, gifts given because the GIVER wants to give them.", "NTA.  And if I may offer a suggestion for malicious compliance, tape a coin of the smallest denomination possible (for example, in the US that would be a penny, or $0.01) inside an envelope, then give the envelope to the coworker as a \u201ccontribution\u201d to the wedding gift.\n\nPetty? Yes.  Does it send a clear message?  Also yes.  And your coworker won\u2019t be able to claim that you didn\u2019t contribute (lol).", "Wedding guests give wedding gifts. NTA sorry work sucks. I do not miss being at an office.", "NTA- Don't you dare chip in! She wants a gift from you but doesn't want to invite you? No, That's bullshit. The people that said you should have chipped in for something are people that just don't like rocking the boat and want to avoid drama BUT there is a very fine line between not wanting any drama and being a pushover. \n\nMy guess is that if a group of people in your office have a clique and are bullying you (or did) then they saw you as a pushover. People don't bully people that will stand up to them, they bully people that will cave or stay silent. Use this as your opportunity to stand your ground. Personally, I wouldn't even go to the luncheon, I would go and enjoy my own quiet lunch that I enjoyed without the benefit of their awful company but even if you still go, I wouldn't waste a dime on the C\\* word (I reserve that word for only those that truly deserve it). \n\nOr I suppose you could return the favor and go out and make sure to get her something really embarrassing. Like a gift card to an adult toy shop or something with bridezilla embroidered across it, maybe a blue handkerchief (for her something blue) with \"Remember, Don't be a bridezilla\" real big across it.", "Totally agree. It\u2019s the guilt tripping that gets me. I feel like the people OP debriefed with who said they should have just gone along with it are just those kinds of people who prefer maintaining the peace (i.e. the current pecking order) over actually considering whether it was fair or just for them to engage with you like this. Their suggestion is akin to just doing the bully\u2019s homework to prevent getting pantsed. Fuck that - we grown. You did the right thing OP, I hope these bootlickers get what\u2019s coming to them and people actually address this hostile work environment. NTA.", "HR was my first thought.", "Excellent comment! I agree with you 100%!!!", "WTF? Is this common in schools there? That's awful, aren't teachers supposed to teach students not to be bullies?", "And that section should be highlighted before the OP gives the book.", "They don't deserve neatly rolled coins at all.\n\nInstead, find a used plastic bag, dump some pennies into it, then pour in some honey and shake it around a bit. Right before handing it over, poke a small hole here and there just big enough to lose a few pennies whenever the bag is shifted. Bonus points if you added enough honey to leak out a little bit, too.", "NTA. Don't let them bully you. They sound awful.", "Lots of 'losers' here honey, and you're not one of them.", "NTA. What\u2019s hilarious is if these colleagues are trying to get away with going to the wedding but only chipping in for one \u2018work\u2019 gift?  Because why would they need a work gift if they are all buying their own?  Cheapskates I bet!!", "Absolute bloody cheek of your co-worker. Dont let them make you feel bad for it.", "We are not allowed to ask other employees for money for things like that. No collecting for gifts, no selling your kids fundraising stuff etc. Our workplace pays for special lunches for things like that but we are not allowed to organize for just these types of reasons. For fundraising stuff for kids my office has a petty cash fund and will purchase once per year from each person. Depending on what it is, usually cookie dough or something like that and we will just bake it up for the office to share.  And a big one, no purchasing gifts for managers and up. I don't understand this trend of employees who make crappy wages collecting and getting a gift for someone who makes 10 times what you do. Ridiculous and managers at my company are not allowed to accept gifts including group gifts from anyone below them. I have been working in office work for almost 40 years and not once have I every gotten a gift or contributed to a group gift for a manager in that time. This has always been seen as inappropriate business etiquette? Even for my yearly cookie extravaganza that I do for holidays, I am given a budget and funds to do so because my workplace thinks it's a lovely thing and enjoy it, but do not feel it's appropriate for me to pay for it.", "NTA: make a complaint to HR, nothing will probably happen, but at least it will be on file if they do this to someone else. It is also highly inappropriate to ask people to chip in for a gift. Everyone can buy their own gift.", "What kind of adult is so insensitive about you being excluding and uses the term \u201closer\u201d to describe a colleague? \n\nSo NTA", "INFO: Were you required to go to the luncheon?  Or could you have skipped it?\n\nThe fact that the luncheon was specifically for the bride to be, and you would be the only person not invited, I would think it would be awkward for you to go.", "Sounds like you work with a bunch of children. I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this. You should talk to your HR department about everything. We have one life to live and we spend most of our lives at work. It\u2019s unfair to be unhappy all of the time due to other peoples outrageous behaviors. \n\nNTA. I hope you find a solution.", "NTA and sorry you\u2019ve had to go through that. I wouldn\u2019t have even gone to the luncheon!", "NTA no invite to the wedding means you\u2019re not obligated to buy or chip in for a gift.", "And if that doesn\u2019t work, just say \u201cAll I\u2019ve got is two 5\u2019s\u201d and menacingly raise both of your clenched fists towards them", "Don\u2019t call HR. You\u2019re NTA but this is not an HR matter.", "Please keep us updated!", "NTA, but I would've given one penny and call th a t my contribution lol", "A quarter and tell her to take it downtown have a rat gnaw that thing off her face.", "Well, this explains why 2 of my most unpleasant, gossipy and alcoholic relatives happen to both be teachers who have problems with every one of their colleagues lol"]}
