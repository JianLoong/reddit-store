She passed away when I was younger and my great aunt, one of her sisters, recently gave it to me as a Christmas gift. Whenever I lose it I have a panic attack since it\u2019s one of the things i have of her and she passed before my memories started to really set in. So I couldn\u2019t imagine someone trading the ring in and telling me about it to my face.\n\nNTA. You already own the ring. She was going to steal it. Good on you for planning to move out.", "NTA. I feel for you. My mother took a platinum diamond ring that would be worth around 20k today the minute I turned 21 & had access to it. It's been a point of contention for over forty years. If you have any sort of family business, or anything whatsoever anyone has left you, or anything material that will be coming to you at any point in the future, you need to understand reality. The reality is your mother will take from you. She will do it free & easy, & you'll need to throw a fit & get people on your side to stop the thievery. In the future, keep in mind that very well may be in the form of attorneys. I can't begin to tell you what my mother took from my father's oil company that he left me. She succeeded because I was young, dumb, & trusted her & my brother, whom I later figured out was in cahoots for his own loot. I'm so sorry she is this outrageous. Last, do NOT be shocked when she leaves you exactly one penny in her Will. These types are like that. Good luck", "Holy smokes! It wasn't even a ring from her mom, but rather her MIL? That is bananas entitled. Her rationale that what is yours is hers because some day when she's dead it becomes yours again is WILD. \n\nYou could flip that rationale against her. What's her's is yours because it will be yours eventually, why not just take it now?", "Ooh, yes. I have a 23K gold-dipped orchid on a 23K chain my Nanna got for me in Singapore, and I hardly dare *breathe* on it.", "I mean, I don't personally care for rose gold or white gold, but 18k rose gold is no less gold than yellow gold, it just has different alloys.  White gold is typically also rhodium plated, so I'll admit that's a bit different, but if it's 18k, it's 18k.\n\nNothing under 10k can be legally called gold in the US.  And for what it's worth, I literally just ordered an 18k ring tonight.  I love 22k as well, but it's not suitable for what I was looking for.\n\nAnd that jeweler sounds like a snob and a dick.", "You can absolutely get 24k gold in the USA. It's not common because you can't wear it without damage because it's soft. \n\n10,14,18k are common because they are more wearable. The alloys make it stronger so a quick smack isn't going to crush it like 24k.", "No pressure but that sounds so pretty if you post an image anywhere \ud83d\udc95 \n\nmany years of good health to you to admire it", "Id say you have the right idea after reading. A gift bought/made/ whatever for you by your grandmother doesnt make said gift your parents firat THEN yours. Some people just suck. Im sorry for your situation and greedy family member.", "It's safe in its box in the safe at my mother's house, but [this](https://www.thebrightbeetle.com/shop/vtg-risis-brooch-pendant-22k-gold-plated-orchid-flower-has-makers-mark/) is very much the same thing.\n\nThank you. May you also have many years of health and joy.", "NTA what\u2019s she\u2019s attempting is theft. Tell her you\u2019ll put it in your will and if you die first, she can have it.", "Safe deposit box"]}
