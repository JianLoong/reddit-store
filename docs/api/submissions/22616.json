I get payed 15 dollars an hour to take care of a large family with 13 kids. It's difficult, but I try my best to give each kid the attention they need. The mom informed me that one of the kids has a gluten allergy, and one of the kids has a dairy allergy. I've tried to keep the allergy kids away from danger and I've usually been successful, until yesterday.\n\nYesterday, before the mom left, she told me that some of the kids have really been enjoying marshmallows as a snack and that they were in the kitchen cabinet. So after she left and snack time came up, I made sure to give all the kids (who ASKED) marshmallows. Everyone was happy, until I get a text saying \"Oh btw Kelly (Gluten Girl) can't have any marshmallows.\"\n\noh My GOD.\n\nKEEP IN MIND: She texted this to me 3 HOURS after she left. \n\nI immediately take Kelly aside and tell her she's been exposed to gluten and that she should go lay down and tell me if her stomach starts hurting. Kelly freaks out. I feel awful. I text the mom the whole situation and how sorry I was. The mom is FURIOUS with me. She starts spam texting me about how awful of a babysitter I was and how I will never look after her kids again. I get about 20 texts telling me how awful I was. I try to keep up a peppy attitude for the kids, but I start frantically looking up if marshmallows have gluten and, low and behold, they don't. I text the screenshot to the mother, and she immediately says \"Well, You wouldn't have to look that up if you just listened to me.\"\n\nAm I the Asshole for not double checking if the marshmallows had gluten in them?

Jesus fucking Christ.", "NTA- I have celiacs and gluten is hidden in so many things. You cannot be expected to know what all has gluten. The mother should have set aside specific snacks for the children with allergies. Also, she shouldn\u2019t have been raging, rather having you give the child lots of water to flush it out faster. The mother is ridiculous.", "Mom of 3 here. You are most definitely NTA. 13 kids?! First of all, you are being severely underpaid. I'd pay you more than that to watch my 3. Also, to ask a teenager to care for 13 kids at once & keep track of which ones have allergies to what & what foods contain the allergen(s) is way too much. This isn't a safe situation for you to be in. You can't possibly keep an eye on all of them at once. Things far worse than an accidental marshmallow are bound to go wrong. Honestly, if I were you, I'd stop babysitting for this family. There are much safer ways to earn 15/hour.", "NTA.  If we're going to judge people for not being psychic then we're in for a whole world of TA.", "NTA. Also, oh my goodness, I babysit a lot of kids too but 13 kids at the same time?!!

Because I cook for GF people and the ones I get (Kraft) don't.", "NTA. \n\nIt is the parents job to warn child caregivers of any allergy/allergen foods in the home. Mom doing it 3 hours AFTER she had informed you about giving kids marshmallows means she is the AH.\n\nAnd 13 kids at 15 an hour? By Yourself!? You should have at least 1 more person with you. Where I live, if any of those kids are under 5, there has to be 2 adults. You should not be doing it alone.", "NTA that woman is taking advantage of you. And she\u2019s an idiot. $15 an hour for 13 kids is ridiculously low. I have no idea what current babysitting rates are but you should be earning three times that for SO MANY KIDS!", "You are not as asshole.\n\nYou should not be babysitting 13 kids by yourself, EVER.  And not for $15/hr.\n\nLEAVE THIS JOB", "NTA-She should have told you specifically which child had which allergy. When there\u2019s more than one child with a food allergy the parent should tell you which child has which allergy not text you three hours later.", "You definitely should check any and all food you are giving a child with a known allergy. However the mums reaction was so contradictory and horrible to you, plus only paying you $15 an hour, why do you bother babysitting for these people?", "NTA if they are bringing gluten into a house with 13 kids I have no idea how Kelly isn't being exposed to gluten all the time.\n\nWhen you are responsible for watching so many kids, expecting you to read food labels carefully is a ridiculous expectation. Dayhomes can't have that many kids and they have systems in place to deal with things like allergies.", "NTA and you should not be stuck with that many kids by yourself, especially for that little money. You're being taken advantage of.", "NTA and you are being severely taken advantage of please quit. You can easily find another sitting gig for $15 for like 2 kids.", "While I don\u2019t think it means you are an asshole in general, in this instance you are most defintely in the wrong for not checking. I understand mistakes happen but that would be the first thing I would do for literally anything for dairy and gluten to check. But I don\u2019t really understand why she would say you wouldn\u2019t have to check if you listened to me if you think the marshmellows have no gluten even though she said it did so it\u2019s contradictory. Also, the moms reaction is too much imo.  Also how old is the oldest kid?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s insane! \n\nDid she pay you? She should have as 3hrs later is ridiculous\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you *really*, *REALLY* need to quit this job. Number one, a daycare with 13 children enrolled will absolutely have more than one person taking care of them. Probably at least 3 or 4. And NONE of them will be teenagers. Number 2, $15/hr is okay for 1 or 2 kids, which is about all a teenager should be handling. For that many kids? More like $150/hr. Please, just quit. She doesn't deserve any notice. And why the hell are your parents okay with this?", "NTA and you are being radically underpaid!", "YTA ESH.  Info: how old is teenager?", "NTA\nAnd if the mother comes crawling back to you because she can\u2018t find anybody else to babysit 13 children for 15 bucks, you tell her that you take 10 $ / hour / child.", "I hope the 15 dollar per hour is per kid, otherwise make yourself unavailable and look for another babysitter gig. NTA, she told you hours after telling you marshmallows are okay, that one of the brady bunch can't have it. Am I the only one who didn't know marshmallows had gluten in it?", "HUGE NTA!!!!  It's the mother's responsibility to ensure that the information is given to you before she leaves, not hours later!  God bless you for doing all that ridiculous hard work and getting paid nothing in return.  You should have been getting $45-50 an hour with that much responsibility.  That's just insanity!  They could have gluten depending on the machinery.  If the bag doesn't say \"gluten-free,\" there could be trace amounts higher than what would be considered safe for celiacs and could affect them.\nHer failing to give you proper instructions would be what would cause Kelly to get sick, not you.  You deserve way better than what you're doing for work, anyway.\n\nI'm so sorry you had to go through that \ud83e\udec2", "NTA No one would expect marshmallows to have gluten.

Find another job and leave her to it", "NTA, surely there are nicer parents out there that you can babysit for!! $15 for 13 kids is horrendous then throw in a parent that thinks rude nasty texts to a kid is ok.", "Absolutely NTA!  You\u2019re being extremely underpaid.  The mom sounds terrible and you shouldn\u2019t work for them anymore.  When she comes crawling back raise your prices to 15/hr per kid.", "How on earth does that mother expect one teen to watch that many kids\u2026regardless of the pay?  That\u2019s just negligence on the part of the mom.  And OP is NTA, but should definitely get a pay raise assuming she doesn\u2019t quit.", "I think it's fine.

This situation (which, in the end turned into a non-situation at least) is totally on the Mom because she needs to be very, very clear about allergies and intolerances.", "Seriously NTA, the mother is the a*hole. You are seriously underpaid, i would either fully focus on schoolwork or get another part time job.", "Unless it was multiple times of multiple births there\u2019s no way at least a few of the kids wouldn\u2019t be close to OPs age or older", "That and OPs profile is bit suspicious."]}
