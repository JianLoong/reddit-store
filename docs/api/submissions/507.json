And by often, I mean everyday type of often. Since Em\u2019s house is just a block down from their school, the two walk there and just hang out together. I get out of school about an hour after Tray does and it takes my mother about 20-30 minutes to pick me up, and then an extra 10 minutes to get to Em\u2019s house after school so they have a good near 2 hours together.\n\nLast Friday when we arrived home, Tray told me that Em\u2019s mother forbids her from sitting on their couch. Tray actually can\u2019t even touch their furniture or anything so she ends up spending the entire time she\u2019s over at their house cooped up in Em\u2019s room. And the reason Em\u2019s mother gave was that Tray is not proper and said numerous things that implied she, my sister, is dirty therefore she should not touch anything in their house or she would end up making whatever she touches dirty.\n\nI will admit that my sister is not exactly the cleanest person in the world, but in no way, shape, or form is she dirty. Tray showers very often, uses deodorant, sometimes perfume, and overall keeps herself very clean (yk the basic hygiene stuff). The only thing I disapprove of looks wise for her is her unkempt hair which is crazy asf. It\u2019s like a wildly wavy and somewhat thick so it looks messy, but nothing enough to give people an impression that she\u2019s dirty or improper. And before someone calls me bias or something because she\u2019s my sister, I\u2019m not. Even my aunt\u2019s ex boyfriend, someone we were and still is very close with family/friend wise, is a total clean freak and he has NEVER had a problem with Tray\u2019s cleanliness/hygiene. Like this dude was known for being on everyone\u2019s ass about keeping everything clean. He made us wipe our feet before entering the house even though we wear shoes, do not let us touch the walls even if we\u2019re walking upstairs, and other crazy stuff but he has never complained or said a single thing about my sister. So I wonder how such a clean freak was okay with Tray, but Em\u2019s mother forbids her from touching even the slightest bit of their house because she\u2019s \u201cimproper\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d. \n\nEven Em thinks that her mother\u2019s behavior toward Tray is odd, which implies that she doesn\u2019t do this to Em\u2019s other friends. I\u2019m assuming currently that it\u2019s racism as that neighborhood is white dominant and houses some pretty racist families (my sister and I are 100% Asian). Even if it\u2019s not racism and something else, I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry. I don\u2019t want Tray to ever feel bad about herself (as I once did because of that stupid neighborhood and school), especially about her own race, so am I the asshole for telling her to stop hanging out with Em **AFTER SCHOOL** like she usually does?\n\n**UPDATE:** I brought up the issue with Tray once again about half an hour ago. I wanted to get her opinion on the matter before I decide on what actions I would take regarding this and she told me that she would no longer be hanging out over at Em\u2019s house as her friend group collectively made plans to hang out together after school at one of the other girl\u2019s house. This means that Tray won\u2019t be seeing Em\u2019s mother again unless she goes over there to specifically hang out with just Em.", "created_utc": 1667194954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi225w/aita_for_telling_my_sister_to_stop_hanging_out/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Although she agrees with me, she doesn\u2019t not want to stop hanging out with her friend because of someone she doesn\u2019t exactly see too often since she spends time in her friend\u2019s room. She was pretty upset that I had suggest she stop seeing her friend since her friends are important to her, especially since she\u2019s at the age where peer interaction is very important so I was wondering if what I asked of her was an asshole move.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Using that terminology can get information from a person without that person seeing it as an attack. Attacks are usually met with anger and digging heels in, regardless of whether the attacked started it. Kinda like boxing vs. judo.). \n\nI heard once a lady was mad at me because she thought I was sleeping with her hubby. I absolutely was NOT, but we worked together. So I called her up and asked if she was mad at me. She had no idea she was supposed to be mad at me, I told her what I heard and she laughed. Came over for drinks.

Good time had by all. Except the drama llamas).", "NTA for wanting to protect your little sis. Is there an after school program she can attend instead?\n\nEven if Em's mother were a perfect angel, it's not ideal to rely on her to watch your sister for a couple of hours after school every day. What if Em got sick, moved away, or decided to spend all her time with other friends, etc.?  Is there any plan B in place, where your sister can go for two hours?\n\nIf there are any afterschool enrichment programs or sports, maybe she and Em could even join them together?\n\nIt sounds from what you said that Em's mother might be a problem.

Even if you're right that Em's mother is racist, you have zero reason to believe that Em herself is racist. Cutting your sister off from a close friend merely because you don't like her mother is a massive dick move, both to Em and more importantly to your sister. You claim you \"don't want Tray to ever feel bad about herself,\" but this act of yours is upsetting Tray far more than Em's mother ever did.", "I meant stop hanging out with Em after school over at her house, not all together. Maybe I forgot to clarify that in my post. \ud83d\ude05\nAnd no, not yet as our mother would definitely react the same way as me, if not worse, and would for sure forbid Tray from ever hanging out with Em.\n\nThank you for your opinion :)", "Will do after I ask for Tray\u2019s opinion later.
