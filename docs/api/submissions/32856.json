I was wearing a tank top but I still wanted a bit of privacy. He quickly closed the door and apologized. About fifteen minutes after I came out of the restroom, he randomly asked how I managed to remove the hair with only one strip. I thought it was a silly question but I told him that the wax I used was very powerful and I didn\u2019t have a lot of hair to remove. He then proceeded to say that women should always remove their body hair because he believes women having body hair (which naturally occurs, how shocking) is \u201cunhygienic\u201d and \u201cunnatural\u201d. That was the stupidest comment I ever heard. He made me feel so gross and ashamed for it at first, but body hair is natural and it\u2019s okay to have it. I replied saying that it\u2019s okay to have preferences, but it\u2019s rude to say body hair is unnatural and unhygienic when everyone has it. I also said that real men don\u2019t shame women for a little bit of body hair (or any amount for that matter). He took this personal and really thought I was saying he wasn\u2019t \u201ca real man\u201d and how I was shaming him for having a \u201cpreference\u201d. Preferences are fine. Calling people gross, unhygienic, and unnatural for having body hair is NOT okay. Now he\u2019s upset at me and said he couldn\u2019t believe I would question his masculinity (I did not). \n\nHow does he expect to say something so ridiculous and not get called out for it? I understand that what I said in response might have offended him, so I apologized for upsetting him. However I didn\u2019t apologize for what I said prior because I\u2019m tired of men (especially my own dad) telling women what they should or shouldn\u2019t do with their own body.
