{"id": 7014, "submission_id": "108ngjd", "title": "AITA for not wanting to turn off my bedside lamp at 2 am per my bf\u2019s request?", "selftext": "Final Edit/Update: This all happened about a week ago and last night I told my bf I would get a book lamp. I haven\u2019t been reading in bed for awhile now because he was now the sick one and I didn\u2019t want disrupt his sleeping anymore. And before everyone gets mad, we both found out we had Covid at the same time. As soon as my symptoms started, both of us took a test and were positive. His symptoms came a few days later. So please stop telling us we were being irresponsible. We followed all the quarantine guidelines and worked from home. My bf\u2019s response was that I didn\u2019t need to get a book light and that it didn\u2019t bother him. I said that it did that night and he said he thinks he was just getting sick too and that it\u2019s not a big deal. That night was the first time he complained about me reading with the light on and most nights it\u2019s off before midnight. So for clarification, I did not turn the light on at 2 am, it was on the entire time. My bf isn\u2019t the best at admitting when things bother him (until it\u2019s so built up he blows up) so I\u2019m taking this as it\u2019s always bothered him and he just hasn\u2019t said anything. So I will be getting a book lamp. I have realized posting here was a mistake. I knew that it was going to be controversial but I didn\u2019t anticipate the cruelty in some of the comments. Keep in mind that you don\u2019t know all the details of a situation or any past experiences of the OP. So saying things like OP is a cry baby or selfish and will never allow people to be happy is just uncalled for. You don\u2019t know someone based on a small post. I appreciate the people that left their suggestions and gave their opinions (YTA and NTA) without claiming things about my character. \n\nEdit: please read the full post before commenting. A lot of people have said I should have moved, I offered. I also offered to get a less intense light. If you have something to contribute other than suggesting things I tried, then please comment. I\u2019m willing to hear people\u2019s opinions. That\u2019s why I posted. But please don\u2019t just read part of the post and judge before you have the full picture. Thanks. Also adding that we did isolate. He worked from home.\n\nSo I recently had Covid and was super sick during the early days. One night, I had a lot of trouble falling asleep because of how uncomfortable my symptoms were making me (sore throat, stuffed nose, fatigue, etc.). So I was up late reading trying to distract myself enough to fall asleep. Around 2 am, my bf wakes up (after sleeping for 3 hr) and asks me to turn off the light. I told him I was having trouble sleeping and reading was to help distract myself from how sick I was feeling. I also mentioned that I took some melatonin five min earlier so I was hoping it would kick in soon so I could go to sleep. \n\nWell, he insisted that I turn the lights off because I was being inconsiderate of the fact that he had to work the next day. I mentioned that I normally don\u2019t have the light on this late and it was only because I was sick and that I would appreciate if he could let it slide this time. When he was still upset, I offered to sleep on the couch. He continued to tell me how inconsiderate I was being and then said HE was going to sleep on the couch and stormed off. \n\nHe came back a few min later and continued to hound me. So I finally turned off the light and went to the bathroom. I broke down crying then because I was already not feeling good and the stress of the fight made it so much worse. He eventually came in and apologized and said to come back to bed and finish reading. At that point though, I just kept the light off and took more melatonin. \n\nThe next day, I asked if he would try a sleep mask and I would try a headlamp (less bright) in the future as a compromise. He refused and told me that I just had to turn the lights off past midnight. I was frustrated because I provided a possible compromise and let him know that I understood his frustration so I wanted to find a way we could both get what we want, but he just kept doubling down saying I was inconsiderate.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1673390468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108ngjd/aita_for_not_wanting_to_turn_off_my_bedside_lamp/", "score": 1909, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't read to fall asleep outside of bed, and he doesn't get to dictate when you must be asleep by.

You should have just moved to the couch and read there. Not suggested moving AFTER he asked you multiple times to turn off the light. You've already disrupted his sleep at that point. If I can't sleep (whether because I'm sick or for any other reason), instead of disturbing my partner with my inability to sleep, I get up, get cozy on the couch and do whatever it is I need to do until I fall asleep on the couch or can sleep in bed without disturbing him.

And so, I voluntarily took my sick self to an old recliner we'd inherited from my parents.  The chair was in crappy shape, but the mechanism worked, and that's where I did my attempted sleeping.  (Pro tip:  the recliner, because it elevates the head above what is normal for a bed, helps with breathing.)\n\nI get expecting a spouse/partner to give you some extra care when they're sick, but unless you're so sick that you can't shift yourself elsewhere when they're trying to sleep, just go do it.  \n\nOTOH, when one of us was *that* sick, the well/less-sick person would use the recliner...which leads me to suggest that rather than the current relationship dynamic, both of you will be happier long-term by trying harder to support one another.

One of you should have been on the couch to begin with.\n\nYTA", "She is sick with covid! That bf is inconsiderate.", "Another redditor expecting perfection.", "This. Like, he should wear a mask because she wants lights on at 2am. That's so damn selfish. It's his bed, he is there to sleep. If she wants to stay up she can do it in another room.", "The person woken up by somebody's inconsiderate behavior is never the asshole.", "and you\u2019ll get weird dreams \ud83d\ude2d", "He should have given her the bedroom while she was sick to recover.", "Or, hear me out, he shouldn't be going to an office when his partner has covid", "Literally my first thought. This should never have been an issue to begin with", "It doesn\u2019t actually matter. If the house isn\u2019t big enough to fully quarantine yourselves off with separate air systems, you\u2019re going to catch Covid from whoever you live with. You may not become symptomatic, but you will be breathing in the same air as them, using the same bathroom and kitchen, and you\u2019ll both most likely still speak to each other. It\u2019s so guaranteed that through most of Covid my oval government and health care professionals literally even told everyone that if someone in your house has it you just have to assume you\u2019ll get it too.\n\nIt is one of the most contagious viral illnesses we\u2019ve ever had affect our species. Just simply sleeping in another room isn\u2019t going to stop it from transmitting between you two.", "I share an apartment with my brother. Obviously, we have separate bedrooms. I brought covid home from work (I'm a PCT) and even with self isolating he still caught it. Covid is incredibly contagious, and even sharing a house is enough for exposure.", "Depending where you live this could just be the norm now. I'm in the UK and not only would it be hugely unlikely for me to actually know if me or my wife had COVID 19 in particular but also it wouldn't really make a difference. Work would still expect me to come in if my wife had COVID. Even if I had tested positive but was asymptomatic I would be expected to be at work. Most of the UK is basically treating this as a cold/flu now, take your meds and get on with it. Probably because the high vaccination rate has protected the most venerable", "If I can't sleep, I generally stay laying down and spend time on my phone, or maybe even put in an earphone with music. But Im also super aware to not shift or fidget, and to keep ANY light pointing off my side of the bed instead of at my partner. I've also read books with small book lights. But the second I notice my partner stirring or changing breathing I'm out of the room. If I'm that awake where I'm disturbing him, then I'm just there agitating him for no reason. But this is also something I've discussed with my partner, he prefers I stay in bed to try to fall asleep- he sleeps better with me there, and if I get up I lose track of time and am usually surprised when he's waking up. On the flip side, if he can't fall asleep, we put on a show I easily fall asleep to and after five minutes he could have a heard of elephants storming through and I wouldn't wake up, so he can read, watch TV, play games, it doesn't matter. Both of us would be very willing to accommodate the other when sick, and both of us would prefer to be less comfy on the couch in order to let the other sleep.\n\nGood communication skills go far. Sleep is important. These two could easily come up with agreements. He can't unilaterally decree things like lights out. She cant deprive him of sleep before driving and working. He can say he needs to be able to get certain amounts of sleep, and nicely ask her to move, or be sympathetic that she's sick and this isn't a regular occurrence and go to the couch. She could also notice when she was disturbing him and leave before it got to an argument.\nIf there aren't underlying issues of not valuing your partner, maybe figure out a second bed so you can both rest.", "Hahahaha.. what the hell? Where is she supposed to sleep?", "Pretty much everyone I know has had COVID atleast once. No one acted so entitled to keep other people awake because they couldn't sleep.", "I would not be quite so definite on that point, myself.", "He may not stay that way if lack of sleep depresses his immune system.", "OP\u2019s story has evolved over time with other information than was in the original post. WFH is some of that new information. OP also later added that boyfriend had also tested positive at this point.", "Oh those melatonin nightmares are the worst!", "So your partner compromised... By doing things your way.\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of people, having a light on while someone else next to you is trying to sleep is the epitome of rude, and it's incredibly basic manners to not keep someone up. Making them have to make all of the adjustments sounds pretty self entitled.", "As both a crafter who uses those lights AND someone who can\u2019t sleep with lights on I\u2019m telling you that is not a good suggestion. Those lights are way too bright for use in a dark room when someone is sleeping. Further, they\u2019re almost always the brighter, cool light which is incredibly jarring on the eyes in a darkened space.", "Feel better soon and good luck to your partner! My husband has had Covid twice, and I once. We never got it from one another, because we have slept separately/isolated each time.", "I've slept on floors,  in bathtubs,  etc... I'm not mad,  though. Are you?", "My ex bf would be a cruel MONSTER for at least an hour after waking up, even if he just took a 20 min nap. No matter how \u2018nice\u2019 I was to him I still got berated over everything during those times. \n\nExample: He liked to have sound and light on at night, I did not. When he was fully awake we compromised with just the TV on at a low volume. Half the time he would wake up to our first alarm or just in the night and would immediately get pissed off and roughly wake me up to yell at me about it. \n\nNot saying AT ALL that this is the same situation, but it is not such a crazy idea to imagine someone, especially after waking up, to be maybe a little more irritable than you would think. \n\nOP, NTA. It sounds like you really tried to make compromises and he just shut you down.", "What utter rubbish. He had already been asleep for three hours.", "She said she offered to \u201csleep\u201d on the couch. Which if he wasn\u2019t fully awake yet probably made him refuse cause she\u2019s sick and should sleep on the bed so he decided to move to the couch instead. Might be reading too much into this but that\u2019s what my mind made of it. Anywho, at least according to her retelling of things/choice in words, she never offered to go read somewhere else and come back when she\u2019s ready to sleep. She just offered to sleep on the couch.", "Thanks! This is my second (Nov \u201821 and now), my partner has had it once (8mo ago). Never got it from each other or at the same time although both exposed in the same places.", "Sadly, employers aren't anymore so if he wasn't WFH they'd still expect him in.", "And he shouldn't have to be going out of his way like that to accommodate her wanting to be rude.", "That's why I use a Kindle instead of reading on my phone or tablet.", ">I am an absolute asshole if I get woken up in the middle of the night. To the point where I refuse to sleep in the same bed as anyone, because I know if they wake me up somehow, sleepy me will 100% say the worst shit to them. It\u2019s definitely not under my control, it\u2019s like only the stupid half of my brain wakes up lol.\n\nI tell people this all the time!  Sleepy me is unreasonable, cranky, and really bad at math.  Make sure you have woken me up all the way if you need to discuss something.  Otherwise I'm not really at my best.\n\nThis is the downside of being a morning person.  Middle of the night me is just a slug lord of grump.  Morning I'm bubbly and cheerful and ready to make you smile (even if that means me leaving your not-morning-person presence).", "That's what I was thinking!!  And he has obviously been exposed and just is going to work?  She should be quarantined.  Or both of them, now, in my experience.", "**AND** he was still going to work.\n\nMan here, when one person of the house got covid, everyone self isolates so it didn't spread.", "I mean, I share a small 1BR apt with my partner. We\u2019ve each had Covid at different times (multiple time) and still share a bed. \n\nWhat\u2019s the point of banishing someone to stay in the cramped bedroom when we both still need to eat, shower, use the bathroom, access clothes, etc. \n\nThere\u2019s no hiding from it so it\u2019s futile to be lonely and miserable too.", "Thank you that is the first thing I was thinking as well. In 2021 my fiance and I both got covid at the same time, we didn't separate because we were both sick to begin with so it didn't matter. But if I was sick and he wasn't, I absolutely would have slept somewhere else or isolated myself somewhere else in the house", "Like seriously, they obviously have a bedroom and a living room with a couch - why not quarantine OP in the bedroom as long as she is testing positive?", "And so what? Sleeping on the couch is not the end of the world...", "Some people have a hard time falling back asleep after waking up. And with 3 hours of sleep, some bodies initially think that\u2019s enough sleep. And like others have said, when abruptly woken up, the worst part of you wakes first.", "There are actual studies that have been done proving that any light coming in triggers the brain to stay active. If she couldn't sleep, she should have been considerate and left the room rather than expecting him to just deal with the light or accommodate her. And not everyone can deal with having something covering their eyes. I know I personally am bothered if I have anything touching my face when I sleep so it would be just as disturbing as having a light on. If she didn't have to work the next morning and he did, she is absolutely TA here.", "Maybe he works from home?", "My bf and I have had it a few times and he recently got it while I didn't. so I slept on an air mattress while he isolated. He wouldn't  even leave the bedroom cause he was scared of getting everyone else in the house sick. Dogs couldn't understand why they couldn't see him lol alot of puppy tantrums though lol", "My partner and I don't even have a guest room. While he was sick with covid (twice), he isolated into our bedroom both times and I took up to the couch. It wasn't fun, sure. But I never caught it from him", "This is me. I\u2019m also a really light sleeper so my husband doing literally anything will wake me up. He shifts slightly to get comfy? I\u2019m up. He gets up to pee or get a midnight snack? I\u2019m up. And every little movement or sound will make it harder for me to fall asleep. I don\u2019t necessarily get moody or cranky but it\u2019s really, really annoying.", "That's fair. I think you and I have a different opinion about what the bed is for. I personally love reading in bed and so does my husband. It helps both of us unwind after the day sometimes.", "Yep! A lot of people, myself included, have a hard time sleeping with things touching their face.", "Could be.  Fair enough.", "Yeah, my issue here is that there was any question that he should be the one to move elsewhere.  Sick person gets the comfort of their own bed. Healthy person keeps their distance as much as reasonable.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. We don\u2019t have room to quarantine so when one of us gets sick both of us do!! \nWe don\u2019t have the luxury of moving to a different room!", "Your house only has one room?", "Have a couch?", "My fiancee and I managed. I was cordoned off in the bedroom, and wasn't allowed out without a mask and lysol spray & wipes. She slept on the couch and would bring stuff to the door for me. She managed not to contract it from me, thankfully", "What? Lol every job requires critical attention\n\nIf the person is sick, they sleep on the couch so the non-sick person can accommodate them better and keep up their work routine. The sick person is already suffering regardless of where they sleep, and they can sleep in the main room during working hours", "I put an air mattress in the living room when my husband caught it so he could have the bed (our couch is NOT one you\u2019d sleep on). If we hadn\u2019t had the air mattress I would have slept on the lumpy couch. I wouldn\u2019t have slept in the same room as him and then got mad for him doing what he needed to do to make himself feel better when he was sick. Im a NAH vote because he could have given her the bed for a few days while she had COVID, that said I\u2019m a grump when I can\u2019t sleep when my husband is snoring away so I get him being irritable too. If you still have covid and he\u2019s insisting on sleeping in the bed that\u2019s a whole other thing. Not allowing you to do what you need to to be comfortable is an AH move.", "The only room with any space to possibly sleep is the living room and 2 of my kids slept out there for the duration when their little sister got sick.", "Not everybody has extra rooms? What if it's a single bedroom flat?\n\nTho, they COULD possibly consider getting two single beds and separate them. Sure, it'd get lonely, but it'd be way safer in the long run imo", "Your house has big enough rooms to sleep 4 people not in a bedroom?", "I live in a 2bd with my wife and 3 kids. Kitchen, dining, and living room are one room. That leaves our room, the kids room or the bathroom.", "Have more than 1 other person?", "So far we have been lucky.and there hasn't been anything to major go through the house mainly just colds. But I   hide in my room everyday anyway. I come out to clean the house or run errands on the weekend when my boyfriend is home. I basically live in my room.", "Must be nice to have a kitchen.", "Where are you getting 4 people from?", "She. Stays. In. The. Bedroom. Completely.\n\nHe. Does. Not. Go. In. The. Bedroom.\n\nIt's literally that simple.\n\nHe brings her food, she stays out of the living room. They may have to share a restroom, and in that case they should both be disinfecting it with every use. Yeah it's not 100 percent but it's going to lessen the risk of sharing a space", "You isolate as best you can. I went through exactly this, and it worked. When the sick person had to exit the bedroom to get something to eat or use the bathroom they wore a mask and we continuously wiped down surfaces.", "It's like people don't understand what one bedroom means. Like they imagine a full sized 4 bedroom house with empty spaces everywhere, that just don't contain beds. We had covid in a one bedroom where the couch was literally in the same room as they bedroom, where the bedside lamp lit up the entire apartment. That's a one bedroom. People just don't want to get it.", "From what you describe, it's because that's called a studio or bachelor's apartment in other places. Where I'm from, a 1 bedroom means you have a separate room for your bed.", "LOVE THIS!!! Also, if you are on your phone and have youtube you can find great audiobooks on there. I have it where I can turn my iphone off (the screen) while it plays - you have to go to safari and go to youtube (don't use the app), then you put it in desktop mode and it allows you to play the book while on the lock screen.", "This gets my up vote and YTA,  nothing less but an  AH", "Not all places require the partner of a person sick with COVID to stay home anymore, as long as they test negative they are still expected to come into work.", "Bc of the incubation period and the fact that I got it from someone we both know (his sister) my fiance and I stayed sleeping together while I had Covid\u2014 funnily enough, even if the circumstances were different we would\u2019ve kept on bc I came down with the fever the night we got engaged! \ud83d\ude02", "I'm sorry that sucks. One of my kids had their appendix out a week and a half b4 they got it. I'm just thankful it wasn't sooner and it was mild. When we first came home from the hospital, one sneeze brought them to tears. I can't imagine how all the coughing would have felt.", "But he had already been sleeping with the light on for 3 hours\u2026.?", "so many of AITA posts are like this where you get one side shown super favorably", "The couch?", "I\u2019m so sorry about your friend. One theory as to why she didn\u2019t isolate: Maybe they simply don\u2019t have the space. That was the case for me when my husband got Covid last year. We live in a fairly small apartment with one bathroom, so short of my leaving and getting a hotel room, I couldn\u2019t really isolate from him. And by the time he tested positive, I was definitely already exposed anyway, so we just quarantined together. We were lucky, though. His case wound up being fairly mild and I never got it for whatever reason.\n\nETA: I work remotely full time, but he obviously had to call out of work sick a couple days.", ">But does she not love her husband?\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When I had covid I was isolated in the bedroom away from my husband and kids because I didn't want to get them sick. Because I love them and didn't want them to get covid.\n\nOkay, so let's put our thinking caps on here for a sec. You state that you love your family and because of that you isolated yourself in your bedroom, yeah? This also means that for isolation to be effective you were the only one residing in said room, am I correct?\n\nSo, now. OP was in the bedroom, where one should be when one is sick and attempting to isolate from the rest of the communal spaces. He made the decision to sleep in the room with her. He should have been sleeping in another room, if I'm not mistaken. \n\nWould you appreciate it if someone questioned your love for your family because they CHOSE to share spaces with you when you were sick, or??", "What\u2019s the diff between that and people using the tv?  Sounds like you have no compromising in you.  Did you miss the part where she was sick, and not typical of her nightly routine?", "Yes, because of your comment. If one is sick and the other person dosnt want to get sick too, they should sleep on the couch/floor. The other one is already sick, one should be considerate and dont make it worse for them", "When did the edit go up? She says they both tested positive when she started showing symptoms. Here in Scotland we are being told to go to work and send the kids to school even if your positive (which is stupid in my opinion)", "Not if you work retail. I was told to do my best to stay away from my husband and still show up to work. I'm like uhm... we could sleep separately, but we still might cross paths easily. I'm not going to risk getting covid and taking it to work. Someone needed to take care of cooking and cleaning after sick guy.", "In a one bedroom you can't isolate\n\nSure you can..... or if you have multiple bedrooms..... they don't though.", "I\u2019m from the U.S, and I say sitting room or sitting area\u2026but I only call the extra area that\u2019s upstairs (I noticed it\u2019s called a loft area where I am) the sitting room. The living room is the main area downstairs.", "Read the entire post and edits. There is no doubt in my mind. YTA, I don\u2019t turn lights on in the middle of the night on my partner.", "I will never understand why people post here only to get upset with their judgement, and keep editing the OP like that's going to make any difference \n\nYTA", "I should get a sleeping mask...we still don't have a curtain in our new place and so our room is not dark at all. Maybe it will help me actually get some rested sleep.", "I had covid but couldn\u2019t sleep in a different room to my ex because I was heavily pregnant and was about to pop so he needed to be near me at all times\u2026. Not everyone\u2019s circumstances are the same tbh", "OP says he is WFH", "Yeah it's the same in Canada, at least the province in live in. As long as a person tests negative, they still are expected to go to work even if anyone in the family has COVID. It's not basically just like the flu and cold here except I guess we do have people stay home when they test positive, because people shouldn't go to work while sick.", "I agree. If I know that my sleeplessness could disturb my husband, I take it upon myself to remove myself from the bedroom. I\u2019m the problem, why should I stay? It makes more sense for OP to just go to the couch and do her reading. Don\u2019t ask or offer, just do it if you know it\u2019ll help.", "Sorry still big time disagree. Everyone has had the flu, too, many times over, but that doesn't mean I act horrible to my husband when he's sick with it. I'd much rather he be the comfortable one when he's sick (or as comfortable as he can possibly be) so he can get his rest & hopefully get over the illness quicker. I honestly hope next time he's ill, she doesn't empathize with him at all. Then maybe he'll understand.", "As much as I try my best to instill in people that they shouldn't be at work when ill, to the point where I refuse to work near them, some people still for some reason turn up when they look like death", "She's sick. There's no need to stay awake and keep her spouse awake till 2 am or 3 am or whatever clock she finally tires herself out from reading. \nThat's selfish. \nThere's such a thing as making someone comfortable and not giving in to a selfish person.", "Yup I was gonna say I'm a sound sleeper, but if I wake up after 2 or 3 hours of sleep it can take hours for me to get back to sleep if I ever do.", "Why couldn't you sleep in the kitchen/dining/living room?  You can use the couch, or a inflatable mattress.  Or even sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag is better than getting Covid.  I don't understand why the bathroom and bedrooms are the only options when you have another room.", "So someone sleeps in the living room on the couch or floor.  Unless you live in a studio,  you can isolate. You will have to get creative and people will have to sleep where they don't normally", "So\u2026wouldn\u2019t it be better for the person sick to stay in the bedroom rather than the main living area where 4 other people would need to be? I may have missed a comment but I don\u2019t see how it makes sense to let the sick person be in the common area everyone else would need to be using", "Yeah turns out i wasn't translating right, I confused what you mean with one bedroom with what you call a studio."]}
