Also adding that we did isolate. He worked from home.\n\nSo I recently had Covid and was super sick during the early days. One night, I had a lot of trouble falling asleep because of how uncomfortable my symptoms were making me (sore throat, stuffed nose, fatigue, etc.). So I was up late reading trying to distract myself enough to fall asleep. Around 2 am, my bf wakes up (after sleeping for 3 hr) and asks me to turn off the light. I told him I was having trouble sleeping and reading was to help distract myself from how sick I was feeling. I also mentioned that I took some melatonin five min earlier so I was hoping it would kick in soon so I could go to sleep. \n\nWell, he insisted that I turn the lights off because I was being inconsiderate of the fact that he had to work the next day. I mentioned that I normally don\u2019t have the light on this late and it was only because I was sick and that I would appreciate if he could let it slide this time. When he was still upset, I offered to sleep on the couch. He continued to tell me how inconsiderate I was being and then said HE was going to sleep on the couch and stormed off. \n\nHe came back a few min later and continued to hound me. So I finally turned off the light and went to the bathroom. I broke down crying then because I was already not feeling good and the stress of the fight made it so much worse. He eventually came in and apologized and said to come back to bed and finish reading. At that point though, I just kept the light off and took more melatonin. \n\nThe next day, I asked if he would try a sleep mask and I would try a headlamp (less bright) in the future as a compromise. He refused and told me that I just had to turn the lights off past midnight. I was frustrated because I provided a possible compromise and let him know that I understood his frustration so I wanted to find a way we could both get what we want, but he just kept doubling down saying I was inconsiderate.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1673390468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108ngjd/aita_for_not_wanting_to_turn_off_my_bedside_lamp/", "score": 853, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its not as easy as just using it for a night or two and everything is fine.  \n\n\nSo if you wish to read at night, get a device that you can set the blue light to off and can use without a lamp.

It helps regulates sleep cycles.  Taking extra doses doesn't necessarily help you to get to sleep.

You woke him up.    But more importantly, you made him miss the window for a swift return to snoozeville.  Yeah you\u2019re sick, but you have to be sick, he didn\u2019t have to wake up at 2 am.
