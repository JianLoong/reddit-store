{"id": 1611, "submission_id": "ynqc30", "title": "AITA for telling my friend that his religious convictions and my personal choices are to be equally respected?", "selftext": "This post is about alcohol. So for some context, my (20F) friend (45M) and I have been going out for meals occasionally. Anyway he's religious (Christian) and I'm a staunch atheist, I respect his beliefs and generally think that people can believe whatever they want if it doesn't impede on others.\n\nEvery time we go out for lunch or dinner, the conversation of alcohol comes up. He usually pays (I did not insist on this, it's just how it is. I have no problem paying for myself) but has told me he won't pay for alcohol. I never drink in front of him and I respect his choice not to drink either.  He tells me quite frequently that he finds it frustrating when women drink because he has less in common with them and he wants to meet women and so on and so forth (possibly a separate post for r/nothowgirlswork lol). I've tried fighting him on this but he won't budge and has quite regressive views on women drinking generally.\n\nHe's also told me that his boss, associates and colleagues will make fun of him a bit when they're out for work dinners and that it really bothers him and that's why he has no good work friends.\n\nAnyway, I've noticed that he keeps texting me in the mornings asking if I'm in bed hungover. And it could probably be funny once but it's literally every single time he texts me he accuses me of being hungover or of drinking at like 9am.\n\nNow I am Russian, and he makes a great deal of jokes about vodka and about Russian accents. I don't believe he is racist, and I think he's just trying to be funny, but you never know. For further context, I don't actually drink very much. Maybe once a week, a couple drinks. The most I've had in a night was 7 or 8 and I've never been drunk enough to be hungover in my life.\n\nSo I brought it up with him telling him that I respect his religious beliefs and so on but he doesn't seem to respect my personal choice to drink and that the two have to be mutual. I've started poking fun at his sobriety and the fact that he's single occasionally to demonstrate my point but he has yet to stop. I told him outright again today and he has taken serious offence that I'm equating my 'sinful behaviour' to his abstinence from drinking, even though he still claims that he respects my decisions. He is also not appreciative of the comments about him being single and not being able to find a partner etc.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit for some context: most of my friends are much older than I am because of various circumstances (also most of them are quite normal and good people). I have friends older than him that I'm closer with and it's never been weird. He and I have been friends for about two years now, maybe a year and a half and we only talk about once a month when we get food and talk about whatever has happened over the last month.\n\nFurther: I don't believe he is grooming me (it was my original thought and that's why I hesitated to speak with him in the begining). I'm not his type fortunately, he's more into feminine traditional women and im nothing like that, I'm basically a guy with tits (short hair included).\n\nTldr; religious friend pokes at me for drinking, I poke at him for his religion, he doesn't take it well.", "created_utc": 1667742408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynqc30/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_his_religious/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is possible to find good friends of different ages, genders, and belief systems, as you don't have to have everything in common to be friends with someone.

A casual mention once is one thing but frequently mentioning it is concerning.\n\nHe might be seeing you as a young person who needs fatherly advice. I would consider the other possibility that he sees you as a potential life partner and is trying to \"fix\" you. He might see these dinners as dates.\n\nWhy not vary things up a bit by bringing along a friend who might enjoy a friendly meal.

Yes, alcohol can destroy lives and it\u2019s possible he\u2019s witnessed that first hand. He also gives off the impression that all Christians (assuming that\u2019s his belief) look down on people. Not all drinkers are toxic alcoholics and not all Christians ride around on their high horse.", "NTA. And I think you\u2019re wrong about his racism.

So it is assumed under 21 not drinking.\n\nAlso, he is an old man taking a young lady out.
