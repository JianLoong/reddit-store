I buy groceries&treat her to dinner&we\u2019ve been the best temp roommates till now. This was for the summer.\n\nFFW, we go on a 1M trip, and I plan to move home after. While away, my tenant asks to stay 3 wks longer&F assures me it\u2019s totally fine to stay w/ her. Post-trip, I go to my parents + F\u2019s sis comes to town. Convoluted story\u2013F doesn\u2019t tell me her sis is coming (I hear from mutual friend). NBD I\u2019m not there anyway. F\u2019s sis extends her trip through the week and F doesn\u2019t tell me until I ask if I can come back, then F doesn\u2019t tell me her sis plans to stay another week, until again I ask. The msgs are PA & F laughs it off saying \u201chope that doesn\u2019t throw a wrench in your plans lol but couldn\u2019t pass the opportunity to have my sis here\u201d. I feel hurt& like I\u2019ve overstayed my welcome&F doesn\u2019t want to tell me.  I say I\u2019d never ask her to do that, but I\u2019m frustrated she didn\u2019t tell me until I asked. She sends a long msg saying I need to be flexible w/her family. I say of course, but I can\u2019t be flexible if I don\u2019t have the info. I chalk it up to misunderstanding & say it\u2019s NBD. She says it is a big deal now. I say let\u2019s talk about it; she doesn\u2019t reply so eventually I call. She says I was out of line; she didn\u2019t owe me anything; I should suck it up & give her grace. I think it WAS her info to share. It\u2019s her house, she invited me to stay, if that changes just tell me. She says she never fights with her friends;this can\u2019t happen again;I\u2019m overly communicative& is mad that she wasted energy on this. I explain that I felt crappy before msging her & was trying to nip it bc we were both being PA. I say I see her side\u2013not owing me anything bc she didn\u2019t know my plan\u2013while I don\u2019t agree, can we just agree to disagree? We agree its so stupid.\n\nI am over it, but F is hot and cold on text. FFW a few wks, I have to go move my stuff\u2013so I msg. She is normal & tells me to stay the weekend & we\u2019ll hang out. I get there & its ICY. She says she\u2019s frustrated; says I\u2019m wrong, overly communicative&sensitive. I\u2019m confused bc I thought we agreed to disagree. She seems mad that I\u2019m not mad? Basically, I\u2019m like who cares. I thought you should\u2019ve told me; you don\u2019t-theres no right or wrong, just different views. She says she needs time. I leave. She msgs sorry the convo went that way & to stay as long as I need & goes out. I say I\u2019m sorry too & am moving my stuff but wasn\u2019t sure if she still wants to hang out. No reply, so I leave & msg \u201cI don\u2019t know how this got so out of hand, but our friendship is more important than this fight. Love you\u201d. She says she agrees this is dumb & that she loves me too. I reply w/ an inside joke, she \u201clikes\u201d it & now we haven\u2019t spoken in 2+ weeks. AITA and not seeing it?\n\nEDIT: friend did okay me staying with her for the extra few weeks after our trip. I actually suggested that maybe it was a bad idea after travelling for a month together, but she assured me I was being crazy and it was totally fine.", "created_utc": 1667569488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylzgqw/aita_living_w_friends/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Basically, it's like you said, a misunderstanding. She doesn't feel the need to tell you when she is having family in HER home, you feel like since you are a temp roommate and stay there with her sometimes, a heads up would've been nice. Just a simple, hey just fyi, my sister will be here a week longer so you'd know where you'd be staying. You're both not wrong. I think she is being pretty dramatic over nothing.", "INFO: does her sister staying there mean you can\u2019t stay there? It seems like that, but I might be missing something.", "INFO :  your post is confusing,  the only question I have is did she give you the ok to stay during the time frame her sister stayed over.  Essentially it boils down to who should have said something.  As the guest imo you should clear dates with your friend ahead of time.  If that was done then it's on her to inform you of any changes in the plan.", "NTA. It does seem that she built up some resentment, even though she always said you could stay at hers, there was something she wasn't saying (in addition to giving you the information about when she was rescinding that invitation because her sister was visiting). You're very right that F sound passive-aggressive, petty, and resentful. Perhaps it's about money, or she feels you take her for granted, but if she won't SAY IT, then you can't fix it.\n\nShe called you \"overly communicative\"? LOL\n\nGet your stuff out of her place, and be available for her to share her actual feelings, but go ahead and move on with your life. Life's too short for petty drama.", "Thanks really appreciate your reply. Exactly this - a heads up would\u2019ve been great. But even if you don\u2019t agree a heads up was deserved\u2026 did it need to turn into all of this.", "Yes! She only has one spare bedroom. Sorry for the confusing post", "So sorry for the confusing post, I reposted a much more simplified version. Yes, she did okay it! During our trip when my tenant asked to extend his stay, I actually told my friend maybe it\u2019s a bad idea after spending a whole month together. She assured me I was being crazy and that I could stay no problem.", "Really appreciate this. I definitely think there\u2019s something bigger going on that she\u2019s just not saying because I just can\u2019t wrap my head around this reaction.", "NTA. A lot of this, especially the bit about her saying you\u2019re too communicative, sounds like she decided you were staying too often or she was otherwise stressed, and just expected you to read her mind"]}
