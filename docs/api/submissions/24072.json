Don't feel pressured to do anything for family, only do it if you're 100% comfortable. I let my brother live with me for almost a year because he didn't have a place to stay, and he ended up almost getting me evicted because he spent money off my card that was for rent more than once while I was asleep. He was also babysitting my daughter while I worked, but I found out later that he was asleep or on his phone all day barely paying attention to her, only to complain to others that I was forcing him to watch my daughter and he was miserable here. (I paid for 100% of the bills, food, and alcohol/weed for him when I could afford it. Literally the only thing I asked was to help me out with my daughter)", "NTA. Your mother doesn't have any sense of boundaries and you need to make those boundaries VERY clear. Also regardless of what she tries to pull later, don't invite her to your wedding.", "Your mom is being petty, manipulative, and controlling. I'd honestly say, \"Ok. So i won't go to yoir dinner party.\" Then ignore her calls andctexts for a while", "NTA so shes blackmailing you? Wow greatest mom ever. No but seriously if your families like that I would take the opportunity to not hang out with em, depending on how stubborn ur mom is she might cave anyways, but either way yeah no.", "Only person who sucks here is the mom. You are NTA.", "NTA. I assume your sister is still living with your mom. How old is your sister? If this is the case, it's a real jerk move to just pawn of her own daughter to another family member, not just to you but to your sister especially. Can't your relatives stay at a hotel? It's not like it's an emergency.", "Manipulation 101! Moms not so mommy.", "Why doesn't she let them stay with her?", "NTA, my (16M) mum did this to me 2 days ago. I was helping my grandad when she texted me saying my uncle was gonna have my room and I have to sleep on her bedroom floor for 2 days. I fucking love my uncle, if she\u2019d have asked I\u2019d have said yes but she literally gave me no choice. There\u2019s literally a spare room (as my brother\u2019s at his girlfriend\u2019s and he was fine with my uncle using it) but nope he had to have mine and I had to sleep on her floor lol. Worth it though because this morning my uncle left me a note and some money saying thank you for the bed. Love him.\n\nMy brother also text me saying I can sleep in his room but my dogs were already asleep in my mum\u2019s room at that point so I just slept on the floor lol.", "Why is she kicking your sister out? Can\u2019t the stepsisters share a room??", "White NTA, shouldn\u2019t you have check with your fianc\u00e9 before saying NO. Also, while you don\u2019t have to help anyone on this planet (family or otherwise), but then you can\u2019t expect to have any family member help you out either. We all do things for family and friends even if it\u2019s slightly uncomfortable. You will realise that when you get old and if you don\u2019t you will have pretty poor relationships with your family.", "Well I would say to your mum, well you are not coming to any future births and you are not coming or invited to our wedding.\n\nI'm a grown ass man you do not get to dictate what and what I do in my own home.", "Whatever happened to \"MY house, MY rules\"??? I thought mothers loved that. So it's your house, your rule. NTA. And I applaud you for letting your sister stay with you for the sake of your sister and not your mom. You're a good brother.", "The bigger issue here is: why is your sister removed from her room in order to give it to someone else for a full month??", "INFO: why does your sister have to leave whilst your stepsisters are visiting?\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if they just don\u2019t get along, but it\u2019s another if your stepsisters bully your sister and pose a threat to her.\n\nIf it\u2019s the former, N T A. If it\u2019s the latter, Y T A.\n\nETA: I just read your edit. NTA, but your mother is. The stepsisters don\u2019t each need their own bedroom. \n\nWhy should your sister be made to sleep on the couch and give up her room? Why can\u2019t the stepsisters share a room?", "NTA but be careful. I wouldn't be surprised in Mom wants your sister to be a permanent house guest. Maybe she wants to have an empty nest?", "Your mother is a piece of work and you are NTA.", "NTA. But...if you're in the US, you might also want to clear it with your landlord as well. A lot of leases specify how long guests can stay, and it sounds like your sister may be there long term.", "INFO: Are you even allowed to have her stay for a month? Most rental agreements restrict how long houseguests can stay to 10 days or less.", "[removed]", "Or let the sister stay with you, but don't go to the family events. Letting her stay is you being kind to her, but it was made clear your presence at the events was not important or valued by them so no reason to attend.", "Well the fact I have a couch at my house is why she thinks my sister can just be sent away to my house.", "Really seems reasonable for someone quite literally living for free.", "Yeah I feel like all that is going to happen is drama.", "I\u2019ve already skipped out on so many family vacations this little dinner party really ain\u2019t sh*t", "She\u2019s 17. Because they \u201cdon\u2019t have the money\u201d to get a hotel room.", "I\u2019m confused on your question", "Very weird. Indeed idk parents be doing things like this to have some kind of power or something", "No they are too precious and privileged to share one room.", "Might be menopause, the lack of hormones can be nuts.  Up to you if you want to bring it up. NTA", "Have your sister stay, and skip the dinners anyway,  I imagine she needs a break from mom the most!", "It's her way of trying to stay in control and negate that you have your own home which does not include her. Kudos on keeping decisions between you and your SO, who is the only other person with the right to a say so.", "You said the stepsisters need their own rooms. Does that mean they were each given your sister's room and your old room?\n\nYour poor sister, being displaced for a month from her own space? Looks like she'll also be choosing to leave the \"nest\" soon as she's able.", "Oh, wow \u2026 I just read your update and imho you and your sister are being treated like second class citizens in your own family. A month is a long time for you to have an extra person at your place and for her to have to be on a couch.", "It sounds like mummy dearest won't be seeing any of bio kids when your sis is 18.\n\nPersonally once your sis is old enough I'd grey rock the shit out your mum.\n\nI'd also go VLC with her.\n\nYou know since she likes her stepkids more than her actual kids.\n\nI'm sorry to say this but your mum sounds really horrendous.", "It was quite literally the reason I let him move in, because I didn't want to go through government funded childcare with underpaid overworked workers who would likely neglect/abuse my little girl. I've since forgiven him, as he did pay me back after he realized just how much he'd spent of my money. He didn't understand how much he was nickel and diming me. (yes my petty ass absolutely printed out my bank account's transactions and highlighted what he spent, and sent it to him \ud83e\udd23)", "How old are the stepsiblings?", "Obviously they haven\u2019t cos u wouldn\u2019t be getting told to take ur sister in. It makes me laugh when it comes to parents and their step kids. The bio kids get told to get over it and stop being selfish while the step kids get whatever they want. Then they wonder why step and bio kids don\u2019t get on. I wish u all the best with ur fianc\u00e9 also I hope ur sister will be ok, as for ur mum I\u2019m just gonna keep my mouth shut as I wouldn\u2019t want to be disrespectful to u", "Why doesn't your mom want them to stay with them?  Or is she living in a different state? If so the threat of not going to family events isn't that much of a deterrent.", "NTA. You mom is. The step sisters can share a room. Putting your own daughter in the couch sends a clear message she favors the step sisters.", "I was going to say if it\u2019s recent it\u2019s probably menopause. Man I wish I didn\u2019t have that in my future.", "Yes my room and her room were taken over.", "Yeah for my mom it\u2019s anything for the golden step kids eff my biological ones", "I mean she disrespected me and my sister with all the bending over backwards to make my step sisters feel welcomed.", "My mom doesn\u2019t want my sister staying there because then there would be too many people at her house. I love about 10 minutes away from my moms.", "Yup, not looking forward to it. Here's to access to HRT and other medical care", "WHAT. \n\nAnd now they are being given your sister's room? And your mom is trying to remove your sister from the house altogether while they stay there.\n\nYour mom is a major, major asshole.", "Just \u2026 wow. I have no words", "Yeah I totally agree but the disrespect part of my message was from me to u as it\u2019s ur mum so I wouldn\u2019t want to say anything about her because that would be me disrespecting you. I hope that makes sense", "Stand firm. You are independent, you are not obliged to do anything she tells you to. It's toxic the way she is treating you, sounds like you're better doing your own thing anyway", "Exactly seems pretty unfair if you ask anybody really. But unfortunately this is how my mom is. No logical thinking on her behalf", "Yeah having the freedom to do as I please is way better then having to ask to go to the gas station or fast food joint", "This 100%. When I turned 18, my mom got stricter with me too, trying to hold onto her authority over me. I had to move out and go no contact for almost 6 months for her to understand that I would not tolerate that behavior. Fortunately she wisened up and realized that she needed to change or else she would push me further away. Didn't stop her from attempting to gaslight me when I started talking to her again by saying I had turned my back on the family. I shut that down real quick though. She never mentioned it again.", "Hell yeah good for you for standing up and not taking shit from her.", "NTA. I had this exact situation land on my lap a year ago. My husband and I just bought our very first home after being stuck renting for 11 years, which has a spare room. We had plans for this room, not to mention it was full of unboxed moving boxes. My mom calls me and tells me \"your brothers house is gonna be selling soon so your sister needs to come live with you for a few months. We'll bring her bed so she has one\". I'm immediately put in a real shitty situation bc for one, this is not just my home. It's mine and my husbands that we share with our 2 kids. It's a decision that isn't just mine. And, this was supposed to be a joyous time for us; to celebrate what we've worked so hard for. Plus, me and my 2 sisters despise our brother for very valid reasons and we're heavily against our parents kicking out their 18 or 19yo daughter for their 29yo son and his family to move there while they settle on the new home. This decision of theirs also grinded my gears bc my husband and I landed in a really scary situation where our landlord wanted to sell his home amid the pandemic and we had no where to go. My parents rejected us but were so willing to take in their son and his larger family. And as much as I love and protect my baby sister, she has very bad mental issues and does not respect people or their property and was just not a very trusted person. Our new home had upgrades done to it such as expensive mouldings, brand new luxury vinyl flooring, etc. Things that we didn't want ruined by her lack of respect and care. She was also sneakishly smoking weed in her bedroom and was something we absolutely did not want around our children or done in our home. My parents didn't have to kick her out just to accommodate their shitty son but they did and a huge fight happened over it. She ended up staying with her bf which was all fine and for the best.", "The dinner is a good time to have a \u201cteachable moment\u201d with your family.  Explain to everyone what your boundaries are and how your mom CANNOT commit things for you.  That your sister is staying with you because she asked, not because you got pushed into it.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is abusing your sister. Legally all children require their own room. I'd call CPS in the middle of their visit.", "NTA step sisters come into town so the actual child is repressed and made to sleep in inferior quarters? where have i heard this before? jeez does your mom know any huntsmen she'd like your sister to go into the woods with? I mean seriously glass slipper city does your mom not care that she/'s destroying her relationship with her kids?", "I'm a better cook than my mom, I'd be fine not getting invited to her house for dinner.  I don't go there anyway, but you're NTAH.", "NTA, And good for you for talking with your fianc\u00e9 she sees no issue. That\u2019s what it takes in a relationship communication nowadays that\u2019s far in between, but kudos to you.", "NTA but let me get this straight, your step-sisters are coming to visit, and to accomodate them, your mom is kicking your sister out of her room / house FOR A MONTH? Way to make your sister feel less than in her own house.  \n\nGood for you and your fianc\u00e9 giving her a soft place to land.", "NTA.\nYour mom has No say in who should stay in your apartment that you share with your partner. She should be taught that. And giving threats when she doesn't get her way is the big AH move.

You are an adult speak to your mother that way in no uncertain terms. Tell her to quit with the childish blackmail or she won't see you at all, you don't need this.

Holy crap, OP, NTA. \n\nIf I were you, I'd either show up to the events anyway, or stay away and let everyone else know exactly what your mom said.
