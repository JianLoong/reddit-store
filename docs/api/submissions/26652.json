I'm not sure if I'm the asshole in this situation.\n\nIt all started when Lisa noticed that I often brought delicious homemade lunches to the office. She began making comments about how she'd love to try my cooking and suggested that I bring extra portions to share with everyone. While I don't mind sharing occasionally, I didn't feel obligated to do so every day.\n\nOne day, Lisa saw me heating up my lunch, which was a special dish I had prepared for my anniversary with my husband. She asked if I could share some with her and a few other co-workers. I politely declined, explaining that it was a special meal for my anniversary, and I had made just enough for the two of us.\n\nLisa seemed offended and said I was being selfish. She continued making comments about how I should be more giving and share my food with my co-workers to foster a better office environment. I tried to explain that it wasn't my responsibility to provide food for everyone, but she didn't seem to understand.\n\nA few days later, Lisa confronted me again, asking if she could at least have a taste of whatever I brought that day. I was getting frustrated with her constant requests and told her no, which led to a heated argument in the office kitchen. Other colleagues got involved, and it turned into an uncomfortable situation.\n\nNow, I'm wondering if I overreacted by not sharing my lunch with Lisa and whether I should have been more accommodating.

I'm not sure if I'm the asshole in this situation.\n\nIt all started when Lisa noticed that I often brought delicious homemade lunches to the office. She began making comments about how she'd love to try my cooking and suggested that I bring extra portions to share with everyone. While I don't mind sharing occasionally, I didn't feel obligated to do so every day.\n\nOne day, Lisa saw me heating up my lunch, which was a special dish I had prepared for my anniversary with my husband. She asked if I could share some with her and a few other co-workers. I politely declined, explaining that it was a special meal for my anniversary, and I had made just enough for the two of us.\n\nLisa seemed offended and said I was being selfish. She continued making comments about how I should be more giving and share my food with my co-workers to foster a better office environment. I tried to explain that it wasn't my responsibility to provide food for everyone, but she didn't seem to understand.\n\nA few days later, Lisa confronted me again, asking if she could at least have a taste of whatever I brought that day. I was getting frustrated with her constant requests and told her no, which led to a heated argument in the office kitchen. Other colleagues got involved, and it turned into an uncomfortable situation.\n\nNow, I'm wondering if I overreacted by not sharing my lunch with Lisa and whether I should have been more accommodating.

Wasn't even paid for by bosses but companies we worked with, or our corporate franchise people. She didn't want to take it home. She just felt other people shouldn't take that much. Nobody was left without food. Ever. She just wanted to police it.\n\nShe told me a coat she owned was a family heirloom and told me a whole story about her grandma and her coat. Ithought it looked really modern. Didn't make sense. She threw it over a chair later that same day, and it had the big, bold label visible. H&M. Which, a quick search says was only sold in Scandinavia from the 60's and only available elsewhere in Europe after the 70s, and then opened its first US store in 2000. Yeah. Fucking family treasure.\n\nIt was all sorts of weird stuff with her. Neverending narcissism, lying and needing to be right and possibly, animal hording.\n\nGunther is better for not being part of that chaos.", "> taking a bite out of it and putting it back\n\nWhy is this an actual thing that happens so often? My sister caught one of the cleaning ladies taking a few bites from her lunch at work and putting it back. Like.....that's about the fastest way to catch some hands", "I worked in a psych hospital, only the unit I was working on and the unit across the hall were open at the point this story happened. We had a birthday potluck for a coworker and myself since our birthdays were a week apart and before anyone from our unit could even get a plate, the staff from the other unit had picked through it. Someone had brought in homemade carne asada and there were maybe two pieces of it left. People are entitled.", "I've worked in many offices and this has never happened to me.", "When I lived in the UK, I was always trying to source chocolate chips in bags more than 100g. People made all sorts of comments about how this must be why Americans are so fat if they are used to buying chocolate chips in bulk. I said that I just wanted to make cookies to share and not have to go through so much small packaging. I was told that British people have their own food thank you and they do not need me to give them cookies or share with them in any way.\n\nThat said, if I turned up with chocolate chip cookies, they were all eaten down to the crumbs.", "This was the #2 reason I wanted to work from home when the opportunity arose. #1 is people are basically walking cesspools.  Can be bothered to cover their mouths to cough. Gross.", "It's a completely unnecessary and superfluous qualifier to the entire situation meant to sway opinions emotionally instead of objectively, garnering votes for the absolutely batshit side that thinks anyone is entitled to someone else's food at work. \n\nWhat exactly does that information change about the situation? Unless it's \"my hubs runs a catering business so I brought a 4lb 18x24 pan of baked manicotti, are 3 bites and threw the rest away right in my coworkers face\" then WTF is this OP talking about lol", "I had one lady hulk smash through a glass-walled office's door and bend the pins so it fully was knocked completely out of the frame.\n\nShe had a whole litany of crazy, though. That was just her pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. The rotten cherry on her mountain of bullshit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, she was fired.", "I wonder why nail clipping is so common? I've had a couple former coworkers through the years that would clip nails. Never looked if they were finger or toe though because I was too grossed out by the sound. Also, had a coworker that had just shy of 20 cats and came in smelling like cat pee everyday. I had to talk to her multiple times about it and ask her to not bring her briefcase that the cats liked to pee in, also multiple times. A coworker gave her a bag full of clean clothes, those also eventually smelled like cat pee. They finally surrendered all but two or three cats and it got better. But never completely gone. She eventually passed away from liver failure from being an alcoholic and her husband asked me out a week later. There were issues in that house. At least she didn't try to take food from people, but other coworkers felt entitled to the filipino group's food, but they were amazing cooks and liked to share their stuff. \n\nI believe this story. Crazy shit happens in offices.", "We had a guy like that with candy in a bowl. Most people took a couple of pieces but he\u2019d bring a god damned solo cup and scoop out 4-6 oz of candy and take it to his desk. Nice enough guy in every other regard. One day, I finally looked at him and said, \u201cDude\u2014you know that me and those two buy this, right?\u201d He felt like a dick. He thought it was company community candy. To his credit, the next day he brought in about 60 pounds of candy from Costco to make up for a year of abuse.", "A few departments at my work would have put up a sign that says \"Snacks, $2 each\" or whatever, and if anyone took them without paying, turn you in to HR for stealing.", "Had a situation like that, our director bought breakfast snacks (pastries, crackers, fruit) for our team, the days my train got me in late (annoyingly regularly for a few months when they were messing around with the timetable and drivers strikes) most of it had been snaffled by colleagues from other departments wandering up to 'say hello' - I made sure whenever I brought something in (for my birthday or Christmas) to keep it on my desk with a clear \"for (team) folks only\" sign!", "Crazy Patty the secret meth head would freak out if you made popcorn and burned any. Just because she was busy eating candy by the handful complaining her teeth were bad from eating lemons. She screamed at a lot of people for a lot of things. Oddly enough she was either fired or never came back from an fmla time off. Very entitled person and I don\u2019t think this is fake. I think this is crazy patty. Nta", "I am so fucking sorry - I know your time with that shit is over, but damn, it still triggers the anger at the entitlement. How very fucking dare they?", "Postal workers, I presume?", "The worst thing that ever happened in one office (UK) I worked out is that one colleague would check the fridge before lunch and after, and anything uneaten that had been there before lunch she would throw away. So if you had bought a pack of sausage rolls or whatever to last the week she would just get rid of them.", "Generally, it\u2019s not expected for coworkers to share food, but if you do bring something in to share it won\u2019t go to waste. \n\nIt\u2019s more like we\u2019re all Joey. We don\u2019t share food, and if we expect someone to share with us then it would be expected for us to share too. If it\u2019s offered as a \u2018hey, I baked for everyone help yourselves\u2019 that return obligation is negated so we can share in the goodies without guilt. (This is a broad generalisation based on my experiences and obviously not speaking for the entire UK population)", "They sound churlish, and not worthy of your cookie baking efforts. It was noble of you to bring some anyway. I would have left them to their miserable Rich Tea biscuits while scarfing my own home-made delights.", "Our admin used to buy regular size chocolate bars and people could buy one for 50 cents when most bars were more than a dollar.  The sign on the jar said that the money goes towards buying more bars.  After the jar was empty they had about $2 in change.  They stopped buying candy and when people asked she said people were basically stealing them and she couldn't afford to subsidize cheap people. People were mad at her and their co-workers who stole and ruined it.", "What a flipping sauce. Whatever her reasons that wasn't reasonable. I would have asked her to replace/pay for anything of mine she chucked away. It makes sense to have a regular clear out of the fridge so nothing is left to spread smells and mould, but a daily chuck out after lunch is a bridge too far.", "I could have done without the chip-shaming. \n\nI used to be a baker, and still enjoyed baking from time to time, but not eating at all. I don't think I ever created any impression that I expected it to be reciprocated in any way. Now I don't bake at all.", "We used to have a Filipino admin assistant whose husband always made the best spring rolls for pot lucks.   I miss that.   I don\u2019t miss the IT nerds who wouldn\u2019t bring anything to the pot luck but show up with containers to take stuff home.", "So either only 4 people out of the office paid for the chocolate or someone was stealing the cash people left behind?"]}
