She always tried to make me feel like her own. My mom married \"Owen\" a few years later and he really didn't give a shit about me. That being said Owen clearly loves my mom, lavishes her in attention, so she had emotional, financial support. Also if he needed to do something for me, like say she was sick and I needed a ride, he would. He just never really engaged with me.\n\nAs a result I preferred my dad's house. My mom didn't really put up a fuss when I began spending all of my time there. She would take me on some weekends to do fun stuff but she wasn't that into the day to day stuff.

We want our parents to match our aesthetic. Kate asked my mom to wear yellow and my mom didn't seem to have a problem at first, but did make a snide comment about how it isn't fair that the bride's mom gets to chose first. Kate let it slip that her mom and Emma had already chosen and my mom lost it.\n\nShe called Kate disrespectful, said she couldn't wear yellow because she was blonde (what???) At this point Owen started laughing at our wedding colors so I got annoyed. My mom tried to guilt me by saying it wasn't fair and Emma and my dad could give me more attention and fun but my mom was a single mom.\n\nI laughed and said she was not a single mom. She was married.

For several years, she *was* a single mother, so I'm not sure why you felt like you needed to challenge her on that. She probably struggled after her marriage ended far more than you realize. Your dad had another family waiting for him after their divorce, your mother did not.\n\nAt any rate, her lashing out at your fiancee and calling her names was totally unnecessary.

I think she doesn't want to go, because people will see how much closer you and Kate are to your family with your dad (wich is no wonder), and she doesn't want to be seen as who she is. She made the decision to play a more remote role in your upbringing, like lots of divorced fathers do. That was OK for you, you had a loving and caring family.

She sounds very selfish and self-absorbed. Idk maybe it would help to point out the reasons why you are closer to your father and stepmother and how it has nothing to do whether he cheated or not at some point. I know with my own father (who also cheated on my mom) I had to kind of seperate his roles as husband and father in my head because I was upset at how he hurt my mom.

Your mom should not have called your wife a bitch.

You wanted to be with your dad and Emma because you felt more comfortable with them, but you seem to look down on your mom for letting you be where you wanted to be.", "Hahaha.... sorry but I just read this & burst out laughing ... not funny but that\u2019s funny. Good Luck with that... take all my wedding planning advice throw it out the window!", "C\u2019mon ... aren\u2019t you kinda just arguing to argue at this point. Who cares if she thinks she was a single parent??? How is this relevant to dress color??? Your Mom heard Emma was involved with picking dress color & got pissed off. Not entirely unreasonable .... not okay but it\u2019s a wedding so people are friggin insane. Shouldn\u2019t the real issue be the way she treated Kate? And Mom a goddamn wedding planner.... Ugh!!! You think your Mom \u201cmight be irritated\u201d because she\u2019s a wedding planner & not involved. Let me erase any doubt... she\u2019s pissed off. I own my own wedding/event planning business, employ 12 people, doesn\u2019t have to be me, but I would absolutely lose my shit if my kids didn\u2019t allow my company to help plan their wedding.... \n\neta", "Did it ever occur to you that the adults in your life were acting in your best interest when you were growing up? Maybe they *all* agreed that your dad and Emma were able to offer you more stability while you were in school, so your mom didn't fight them about the arrangement they had with you? Maybe they *all* agreed that it was better for you to be able to come *home* after school, rather than for you to go to some daycare while you waited for your mom to get off of work? \n\nYour attitude towards your mom is so cold, and that's pretty unfair. Would you have preferred her to take your dad and Emma to court and drag you through a custody battle? Would you have preferred to be driven to school by random housekeepers and then shuttled off to a center every afternoon? I mean, maybe give your mom the benefit of the doubt. Sounds like she wanted what was best for you as much as Emma and your father did.", "Oof in that case NTA", "Yeah but either way being a single mother when you\u2019re employed or unemployed still is incredibly hard.", "It does IF she was the sole parent in HER own household while the guy had an AP with her. The playing field isn\u2019t equal for get", ">No I resent her for what she chose to do with her days off and her evenings \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu4qkm/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_was_not_a_single/iw7xw2w/", "Not everyone can handle the mental load of being a stay at home parent.  Sounds like you resent her for her choice to work.", "Well see there\u2019s the rub .... Mom was being crazy about dress colors (yes as the Mother of the groom she is entitled to have an opinion & even get to choose her own color) & crazy about her son\u2019s wedding planning (pretty standard in this industry) BUT somehow we all got to whether or not she sees herself as a single Mom. Well that just does not make a lot of sense now does it? Certainly doesn\u2019t solve the problem of dress color..... So let\u2019s stick to the point.... what is she wearing to the damn wedding.", "There are plenty of women I\u2019ve met that can\u2019t trust their husbands to supervise their children and split rent like they would a roommate. Especially when the woman makes more money. The contributions of the husband to daycare is the same amount as child support. Basically living with a roommate as a single mother except you don\u2019t get a room to yourself.", "I agree.\nThe parents evenings, doctor appointments, shitty school days, sick days. The weekdays where you have to juggle life and kids. Those are the hardest days of being a parent. \nAs a kid those weekends with dad are amazing, but the vast majority of the parenting trials happens on the weekdays.\nI got friends who had weekend dads and friends whose kids have weekend dads, nothing wrong with that, but as the mums do like 70% of the actual work, I still call them single parents. \nAlso that is not a lot of money to raise kids.", "I\u2019ve always (and I am old) heard the phrase \u201csingle parent\u201d refer to the parent who has primary custody and also does not have a live-in partner. It sounds like the other usage you mention is less a practical descriptor and more a tongue-in-cheek dig at the spiritually absent (but still live-in) parent. Which is a new usage for me.", "He went with dad and Emma **because** mom was spending time with Owen instead of OP.", "NO She still has Ops dad that helps and takes care of him! \nSingle parent means PARENTING COMPLETLY ALONE", "Haha my ex husband said the same thing. Even admitted the baby and toddler years were \u201cboring.\u201d He only wanted to be the \u201csport dad\u201d where he could be there for those events. \n\nIn OPs situation, with his comments it sounds like mom had to work on her career after the divorce and dad got married to AP who became a SAHM to him. Yet OP doesn\u2019t see the difference or even sympathizes about what happened to his mother.", "That's fair, OP doesn't give us a clear time line for the remarriages. They state a few years, so that could be interpreted that OP was of an age where their opinion could start to be considered in custody decisions.\n\nThis is a lot of assumption however. We don't know much other than what OP has presented us. They state that their mother didn't really love their father and the divorce was more a blow to her pride. At the same time she was a parent largely not involved in the day to day stuff. I do not condone cheating, however we need to understand why people are motivated to make certain decisions.\n\nI'd also like to point out that just because one parent may have majority custody it doesn't make them the better parent.", "Alright so for a few years in between OP\u2019s father and Owen she had split custody of one kid. So she was kind of a single mother for a few years and otherwise was just kind of a not so great parent the other 20", "No I resent her for what she chose to do with her days off and her evenings", ">yes as the Mother of the groom she is entitled to have an opinion\n\nEveryone is entitled to an opinion. That's what free speech covers. That does mean you can make snide comments and make your child's wedding about you just because you're mad his stepmom chose a colour. She didn't even have a problem with the actual colour until it came out who was behind it.\n\n>pretty standard in this industry\n\nIdk why but you keep using this as some justification or reason to let it go because it's 'standard'. Controlling bridezillas are also standard and not uncommon but guess what? They're still wrong and need to be checked.\n\n>somehow we all got to whether or not she sees herself as a single Mom\n\nBecause that's what she labeled herself to garner sympathy. You act like he just said she wasn't a single mother out of the blue. That's what he wants judgement on so obviously that's a point of focus. \n\nThis isn't an advice sub so what she'll end up wearing to the wedding is neither here nor there.", "No that\u2019s not a single mom. That is a woman who may have a sorry husband/wife but they do have that help. They are not alone even if they feel alone so it\u2019s not good but not a single mom.", "I\u2019m talking about HER being ALONE in HER HOUSEHOLD.", "Projecting?", "How??? Where are you even getting that from? Just because a kid chooses to stay with one parent in no way makes that person the \"better\" parent lol. Usually just means they're the parent who doesn't try to parent.", "The resentment for your mother is dripping off of you.  Bet you blame her for your dads infidelity too.", "You\u2019re replying to my response .... where I say I\u2019m a wedding planner & offer OP my advice ... Have done this this for a very long time it. Now I pay 12 other people to do it for my business. Throw your worst crazy family drama into a wedding. I unravel it, resolve it & get everyone to the chapel. You will still have family drama but your wedding will be successful. I am giving OP my wedding planning advice not life advice, he can do whatever he wants. You can certainly have your opinion & plan a wedding however you choose. I can\u2019t force anyone to take my advice or do what they don\u2019t want to do. I am not getting paid so I have no horse in this race, I\u2019ll just keep running my business the way I run it.\n\nETA \u2014 just read that OP\u2019s Mom is a wedding planner lol.... soooo there\u2019s no reason for me to be here. This will be an interesting wedding", "It\u2019s a saying about women who have 100% of the parenting responsibilities despite being married", "lmao that doesnt really count since 7 year old can be taught to tend themselves and it also seems ops mom didnt do alot as a mom", "Some bias, yes. Ive also worked in family law for many years and it is a common theme.", "Thats true. I\u2019m also speculating since it\u2019s obv not the full story. But 7 is still young so you can\u2019t fully tend to yourself like that.", "Sad that you experienced that, I had the exact opposite experience growing up so did just about every single dad I know so it\u2019s probably not accurate to project that on to every situation. At least w/o more info from OP."]}
