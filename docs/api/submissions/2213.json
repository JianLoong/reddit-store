At this point Owen started laughing at our wedding colors so I got annoyed. My mom tried to guilt me by saying it wasn't fair and Emma and my dad could give me more attention and fun but my mom was a single mom.\n\nI laughed and said she was not a single mom. She was married.

In both cases the mothers should work with the bride as to what they wear. This does not mean the bride gets to dictate to the mother of the groom. Your fiance should have shown some respect for your mom and talked with her about colors.

Never mind that sometimes you don't notice how dead inside you are until you run into someone who makes you see that an alternative life is actually possible.
