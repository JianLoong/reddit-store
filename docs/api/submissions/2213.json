She always tried to make me feel like her own. My mom married \"Owen\" a few years later and he really didn't give a shit about me. That being said Owen clearly loves my mom, lavishes her in attention, so she had emotional, financial support. Also if he needed to do something for me, like say she was sick and I needed a ride, he would. He just never really engaged with me.\n\nAs a result I preferred my dad's house. My mom didn't really put up a fuss when I began spending all of my time there. She would take me on some weekends to do fun stuff but she wasn't that into the day to day stuff. I don't hate her or anything and we have an ok relationship, but I do prefer my dad and Emma.\n\nI am currently getting married. We'll call her \"Kate\" Kate has a civil but shallow relationship with my mom and a great relationship with Emma.

We want our parents to match our aesthetic. Kate asked my mom to wear yellow and my mom didn't seem to have a problem at first, but did make a snide comment about how it isn't fair that the bride's mom gets to chose first. Kate let it slip that her mom and Emma had already chosen and my mom lost it.\n\nShe called Kate disrespectful, said she couldn't wear yellow because she was blonde (what???) At this point Owen started laughing at our wedding colors so I got annoyed. My mom tried to guilt me by saying it wasn't fair and Emma and my dad could give me more attention and fun but my mom was a single mom.\n\nI laughed and said she was not a single mom. She was married. He helped out if he had to, was a great financial provider, and clearly makes her happy so I don't want to hear her whining.\n\nMy mom snapped at me that she was a single mom and I'm devaluing that and choosing my cheating dad over her again.

Sounds like she still harbors some resentment about that and wasn't nearly as cool with it as you insist she was. And I'm guessing that her getting you on the weekends when you were a kid was because she was working during the week? Sounds like she still feels sad and guilty about that, too. For several years, she *was* a single mother, so I'm not sure why you felt like you needed to challenge her on that. She probably struggled after her marriage ended far more than you realize. Your dad had another family waiting for him after their divorce, your mother did not.\n\nAt any rate, her lashing out at your fiancee and calling her names was totally unnecessary.

I would ask an apology for this\n\n>She called Kate a bitch\n\nAnd if she doesn't, she is not needed at your wedding. I think she doesn't want to go, because people will see how much closer you and Kate are to your family with your dad (wich is no wonder), and she doesn't want to be seen as who she is. She made the decision to play a more remote role in your upbringing, like lots of divorced fathers do. That was OK for you, you had a loving and caring family.

She sounds very selfish and self-absorbed. Idk maybe it would help to point out the reasons why you are closer to your father and stepmother and how it has nothing to do whether he cheated or not at some point. I know with my own father (who also cheated on my mom) I had to kind of seperate his roles as husband and father in my head because I was upset at how he hurt my mom. But I also have a great relationship with my dad and I'm very glad I do because he's great and he's a wonderful grandfather to my children.
