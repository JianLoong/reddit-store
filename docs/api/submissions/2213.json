She always tried to make me feel like her own. My mom married \"Owen\" a few years later and he really didn't give a shit about me. That being said Owen clearly loves my mom, lavishes her in attention, so she had emotional, financial support. Also if he needed to do something for me, like say she was sick and I needed a ride, he would. He just never really engaged with me.\n\nAs a result I preferred my dad's house. My mom didn't really put up a fuss when I began spending all of my time there. She would take me on some weekends to do fun stuff but she wasn't that into the day to day stuff. I don't hate her or anything and we have an ok relationship, but I do prefer my dad and Emma.\n\nI am currently getting married.

We want our parents to match our aesthetic. Kate asked my mom to wear yellow and my mom didn't seem to have a problem at first, but did make a snide comment about how it isn't fair that the bride's mom gets to chose first. Kate let it slip that her mom and Emma had already chosen and my mom lost it.\n\nShe called Kate disrespectful, said she couldn't wear yellow because she was blonde (what???) At this point Owen started laughing at our wedding colors so I got annoyed. My mom tried to guilt me by saying it wasn't fair and Emma and my dad could give me more attention and fun but my mom was a single mom.\n\nI laughed and said she was not a single mom. She was married. He helped out if he had to, was a great financial provider, and clearly makes her happy so I don't want to hear her whining.\n\nMy mom snapped at me that she was a single mom and I'm devaluing that and choosing my cheating dad over her again.

For several years, she *was* a single mother, so I'm not sure why you felt like you needed to challenge her on that. She probably struggled after her marriage ended far more than you realize. Your dad had another family waiting for him after their divorce, your mother did not.\n\nAt any rate, her lashing out at your fiancee and calling her names was totally unnecessary.

I think she doesn't want to go, because people will see how much closer you and Kate are to your family with your dad (wich is no wonder), and she doesn't want to be seen as who she is. She made the decision to play a more remote role in your upbringing, like lots of divorced fathers do. That was OK for you, you had a loving and caring family.

She sounds very selfish and self-absorbed. Idk maybe it would help to point out the reasons why you are closer to your father and stepmother and how it has nothing to do whether he cheated or not at some point. I know with my own father (who also cheated on my mom) I had to kind of seperate his roles as husband and father in my head because I was upset at how he hurt my mom.

Even though his dad did take care of him later OP shouldn\u2019t discredit his mom when she was a single mom. Also his mom works while the affair partner didn\u2019t so of course she would have time to get to know OP", "Nothing in this post says Mom deserves to be disrespected. Her husband cheated on her, got remarried, Mom raised her kid, then got remarried... OP liked Emma more than Owen so Dad got the kid. What am I missing? OP prefers Dad & Emma so he got what he wanted.", "Mom doesn\u2019t need her position recognized. She is in fact his mother. There\u2019s no argument. OP is complaining about having a lot of people who obviously love & care for him in his life. There\u2019s literally no point for this drama. This is arguing for the sake of arguing. Mom is acting like a crazy wedding Mom. Not surprising in anyway. The only person here owed an apology is Kate.", "Exactly. When did single mom = not married?! Not only was the father in the picture but OP even states they spent more time with their dad than with their mom. NTA OP", "Nope, it\u2019s rude. Sorry. You don\u2019t get to dictate what your guests wear other than \u201ccasual\u201d or \u201cbeach wedding\u201d or something like that. \n\nNow, ok, I\u2019m 60 so out of touch with some changes. Younger people like to criticize us boomers and in some things they\u2019re right. We can be pretty oblivious in how costs of getting started in adult life have changed so much and so horribly from our time to now.\n\nIf younger people don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude to be told what colour to wear, fair enough. I guess that\u2019s a change in society. *But* a wedding normally has guests of all ages and I promise you, the older ones - the ones old enough to be parents of the couple - are old enough to feel this is rude.", "I mean it would be upsetting that the woman her husband cheated with got to choose first over her at her own child\u2019s wedding.", "Ok, in my circle it would totally be considered very odd and overbearing to do this! I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re American as most are on Reddit - maybe this is a national or regional difference ( I\u2019m Canadian.) I live and learn!\n\nI\u2019m sorry, then, for what I said if that\u2019s the standard where you are! I hope this all gets solved. Weddings do tend to bring out strong emotions. \n\nBest wishes for a long and happy life together.", "> *\"My mom married \"Owen\" a few years later\"*\n\nWait, I'm confused. Was it a few years, or 9 months?", "Maybe OP was acting in a hostile way to his mom and that Owen felt.", "Oh my bad, the way the comment was made I thought this was something that happened when he was growing up\u2026", "It\u2019s because with age kids become easier to raise. A great deal of divorces happen during 1-7 years old. But dads only seem to \u201cstep up\u201d and ask for more custody later because the kid is self sufficient. But they had no part in actual raising from the tender years.", "It's in the first line of the post, OP was 7 when his parents divorced.\n\nAlso, you're making some assumptions in your comment. We have no idea what kind of parent either of them were like to OP prior to the divorce.", "A single mother also referred to as a \u201csingle mom\u201d is an unmarried female aka single parent who has little to no support from the child/children's father. \n\nPer Wikipedia, and she did have support from the father so no, she isn't a single mom. She also had a husband for most of it so the single mom doesn\u2019t fit.", "Yes! And OP says they started preferring Dad's place AFTER Mom remarried and had a spouse who didn't seem to want a stepchild around.", "I\u2019m replying to you specifically", "Wasn\u2019t standard when we got married.  We let them wear whatever they wanted too.  Maybe I\u2019m too lowbrow for matching weddings lol.", "That is when they got married. they were in a relationship and living together before then", "OP didn\u2019t say or describe that he was. I went with what was written.", "Exactly. I literally had my ex husband once tell me, in response to me saying he should try to bond more with our baby, \"I'll bond with him when he's old enough to catch a ball.\" Actually, that's part of the reason he's now the ex lol", "I also meant how old when OP started spending more time at dad's. And, unless they had a 50/50 parenting plan (doesn't sound like it), then one parent was definitely objectively \"better\" by virtue of actually being there. I just can't understand leaving your kid in one home so you can move into another with the person you cheated on their parent with. How is that not deliberately putting someone over your kid? And how can you be a good parent in that situation?", "\"A single parent is a person who has a child or children but does not have a spouse or live-in partner to assist in the upbringing or support of the child. \"\n\nThat's from Wikipedia. Soooo????", "I understand. But I wasn\u2019t making a general statement regarding Moms, I was speaking about OP\u2019s Mom. Sure they can be shitty people, doesn\u2019t sound like the case here. And I disagree everyone deserves respect. It should be yours to lose not earn.", "That\u2019s like saying old people deserve respect just for being old. And it sounds like the mom is definitely being shitty, she can\u2019t wear yellow cuz she\u2019s blonde? Can\u2019t even be honest about why she\u2019s upset until it\u2019s a fight. That\u2019s not respectable behavior", "Not really it\u2019s like saying everyone deserves respect because they are people. People can absolutely create situations where you lose respect for them regardless of who they are in your life. I guess I would also be a shitty person because there are colors I won\u2019t wear. Natural red head, won\u2019t wear pink, orange, yellow. Weddings make people crazy! They say crazy stupid stuff. Mom is the ah for speaking to Kate the way she did but she\u2019s the Mom in this wedding equation so she chances are good ... she\u2019s going to try to make her son\u2019s wedding day about her. She is the MOM! Happens everyday. Don\u2019t have to like it but it is a fact.", "Yeah but she agreed until she got an answer she didn\u2019t like, and that makes her shitty in this situation.", "She definitely going to be a handful to manage. I could tell you hundreds of stories of crazy wedding Moms!!!"]}
