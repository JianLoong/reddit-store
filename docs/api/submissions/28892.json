Please note that this friend has been an alcoholic for 30 years now.\n\nThe night started off fine, doing some silly quizzes, would-you-rather questions, and chatting about anything that came to mind. By the time things started to go downhill, I was on my 3rd mixed drink (about 2oz of alcohol per glass) and my friend was on her 12th beer (We're in Canada so beer = strong). Around 10pm, my friend had to go to the bathroom. Barely a minute after she left, I heard a blood-curdling scream. Me and my kid rushed to see what happened and we found my friend lying on the ground with her ankle swelling up - clearly twisted.\n\nWe spent the next 20 minutes trying to help her but she refused to listen to both of us. Keep in mind, my friend is a 270lbs woman with very bad knees, she couldn't do much herself. We offered to pull her up to have her sit on the edge of the tub or on the toilet but she just kept pushing us away. I just gave up at one point.\n\nI sent my kid to their room at some point and spoke to my friend one-on-one. She wanted nothing of it, and kept saying \"get the fuck out of my face,\" and, \"don't touch me,\". I just stopped offering help at this point. That didn't stop her from constantly abusing me over the course of the rest of her stay.\n\nMy friend called her boyfriend to come pick her up but I assume he didn't want to since she had to call for an ambulance. She kept playing the victim, putting on fake tears every time her phone rang, and saying, \"I'm all alone, no one is here to help me,\".\n\nMy friend constantly begged for her beer and a cigarette. My kid gave her the beer before cussing her out but I refused to give her any cigarettes. I live in an old house that was split into three apartments. My landlord lives right above me, so we share a vent system. If my friend smoked inside, me and my kid would be kicked out onto the streets. She kept whining about wanting her cigarette but \"wouldn't smoke it\". I refused to risk homelessness for a stupid cigarette.\n\nIt took two hours of me pacing back and forth in my house for someone to show up but paramedics finally did at 12:20am. I let the paramedics know that my friend was drunk and stepped back to take a break from the entire situation. By 12:40am, my friend was out and into the ambulance. A paramedic came to retrieve her stuff but also told me which hospital she was being taken to. I answered, \"She's been cussing me out for two hours, her boyfriend can go see her,\". With that, the paramedics left.\n\nI took a moment to relax and apologize to my kid and roommate for the night. But I've been thinking that I might be the crazy one here. So, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: for everyone who keep commenting about my kid, they are 19 and had these casual drinking nights with us.

Why would you invite an alcoholic over for a binge drinking session then be surprised when things turn bad?", "YTA. You were clearly aware that your friend had a substance abuse problem and decided to invite them over to partake in said substance with your child and a ceiling away from your landlord who would apparently evict you over smoking inside. Just wildly irresponsible and questionable decisions and I can't speak for how intoxicated you were but when the situation became too much for you, you should have just called your friends bf to pick her up or called the paramedics right away.

Buuuut YTA for inviting someone who you know has a substance abuse issue, into your home, with your child and you gave them the said substance.. the whole \u201cyour child got them a drink\u201d is just so unbelievably sad for your child. That\u2019s a core memory they will have of their mothers alcoholic friend being abusive whilst drunk in their bathroom.

You can't reason with most drunk people.  Good  call on the cigarettes.  \"I won't smoke it.\"  Pig's arse.", "NTA she got herself into the mess all by herself and then got nasty when you tried to help. It wasn\u2019t a life threatening injury and she needed an attitude adjustment. \n\nA long time ago I remember an ER doctor telling us about her mom breaking her ankle and not wanting to go to the hospital. We figured she would have made an issue out of it and insisted. Nope, she said the injury was stable and she just let her mom decide when she was ready to be sensible and go to the hospital rather than arguing about it.", "NTA. You did fine. She was resistant to being helped.", "NTA. Sounds like your friend is pretty determined to self isolate.", "NTA\n\nQuestion though, if you know this friend is an alcoholic why would you invite her over to drink?

As for your 19 year old, it won't harm them to see for themselves the bad side of alcohol.  Hopefully this experience will help them make better decisions than your friend.", "NTA", "NTA but your friend is abusive. I wouldn't host another drinking binge either.

I consider myself an alcoholic, I usually have 4 or 5 drinks after work every night and have been to some serious ragers.\n\nI'm friends with plenty of people who are not alcoholics who I drink with occasionally and do game nights and stuff.

I was never far from the bathroom door too to make sure she was somewhat okay.", "My kid is 19. I understand what you saying but it won't really be as 'important' to them when thinking back to tonight.

Wasn't able to know the night would go this way", "It's the kind of foresight I'd expect from a 3 year old, not 44 year old. Alcoholics can't moderate their drinking behaviour...you know, because it's a disease.

She has a disease.", "By your own statement you had 12 oz of hard liquor yourself", "Alcoholism kills people and ruins relationships. Don't try to downplay the seriousness of the disease just because you're currently functional.", "Mhm.

Do you think alcoholism should be embraced and celebrated? \n\nYour other comments state that you consider yourself an alcoholic, and you seem to believe that\u2019s ok, because you\u2019ve never hurt anyone, or damaged property. Maybe you\u2019ve never physically hurt anyone, but I can almost guarantee others have been hurt or upset by your disease. If it hasn\u2019t happened yet, it will. \n\nThe nature of addiction is to kill the addict. Sometimes it\u2019s very quick, and sometimes it\u2019s very drawn out, but unless you get sober, the ending won\u2019t be happy.

So perhaps \"never\" in my initial comment was a strong word. But either way, yeah, certainly doesn't seem relevant to this particular situation.\n\nI would probably consider it the same as going to a sweets shop with someone who is diabetic but whose diabetes is well-managed and they know exactly how much sugar they can have and how to manage their body's response to it. But I wouldn't go to that same sweets shop with a diabetic friend whose diabetes is NOT well-managed and who is at risk of harm from excessive sugar intake."]}
