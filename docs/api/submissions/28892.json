Please note that this friend has been an alcoholic for 30 years now.\n\nThe night started off fine, doing some silly quizzes, would-you-rather questions, and chatting about anything that came to mind. By the time things started to go downhill, I was on my 3rd mixed drink (about 2oz of alcohol per glass) and my friend was on her 12th beer (We're in Canada so beer = strong). Around 10pm, my friend had to go to the bathroom. Barely a minute after she left, I heard a blood-curdling scream. Me and my kid rushed to see what happened and we found my friend lying on the ground with her ankle swelling up - clearly twisted.\n\nWe spent the next 20 minutes trying to help her but she refused to listen to both of us. Keep in mind, my friend is a 270lbs woman with very bad knees, she couldn't do much herself. We offered to pull her up to have her sit on the edge of the tub or on the toilet but she just kept pushing us away. I just gave up at one point.\n\nI sent my kid to their room at some point and spoke to my friend one-on-one. She wanted nothing of it, and kept saying \"get the fuck out of my face,\" and, \"don't touch me,\". I just stopped offering help at this point. That didn't stop her from constantly abusing me over the course of the rest of her stay.\n\nMy friend called her boyfriend to come pick her up but I assume he didn't want to since she had to call for an ambulance. She kept playing the victim, putting on fake tears every time her phone rang, and saying, \"I'm all alone, no one is here to help me,\".\n\nMy friend constantly begged for her beer and a cigarette. My kid gave her the beer before cussing her out but I refused to give her any cigarettes. I live in an old house that was split into three apartments. My landlord lives right above me, so we share a vent system. If my friend smoked inside, me and my kid would be kicked out onto the streets. She kept whining about wanting her cigarette but \"wouldn't smoke it\". I refused to risk homelessness for a stupid cigarette.\n\nIt took two hours of me pacing back and forth in my house for someone to show up but paramedics finally did at 12:20am. I let the paramedics know that my friend was drunk and stepped back to take a break from the entire situation. By 12:40am, my friend was out and into the ambulance. A paramedic came to retrieve her stuff but also told me which hospital she was being taken to. I answered, \"She's been cussing me out for two hours, her boyfriend can go see her,\". With that, the paramedics left.\n\nI took a moment to relax and apologize to my kid and roommate for the night. But I've been thinking that I might be the crazy one here. So, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: for everyone who keep commenting about my kid, they are 19 and had these casual drinking nights with us.\n\nEdit two: This account belongs to the kid in the story.

I think that's pretty par for the course for my social circle. \n\nIt's definitely not like whatever is going on in this post.", "I\u2019m Canadian and I didn\u2019t drink with my parents. I knew a few who did, but most didn\u2019t. And there were very few parents who would invite an alcoholic friend of theirs to drink with their kid. It\u2019s a horrible idea, and op saying \u201cwe\u2019ve done it before but it didn\u2019t go to this extent\u201d doesn\u2019t make it better.", "Yeah, I\u2019m also Canadian and after I turned 19 it wasn\u2019t uncommon to casually drink while socializing with my parents too. Board game nights, just chilling etc. it was like a handful of times a year but I would also go to the pub with them for lunches where we\u2019d also have drinks with lunch. When my sister turned 19 she joined us.", "So?", "I would if I could afford it, trust me.", "I am so sorry you have to deal with a parent like that. I hope you haven\u2019t had to be the adult in the relationship like it sounds, but if your mother is an alcoholic I really encourage you to find a good therapist.", "This also makes me suspect they may not be legal drinking age, depending on province.", "That\u2019s what it is- the mom is trying to minimize how egregious her behaviour was", "Yeah, I've drank with my parents and their friends, but some have definitely had drinking problems. Having to parent a bunch of people twice your age is not okay.", "You\u2019re in Canada, there is therapy that is covered and free!! It is a longer wait, but so worth it\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc90 so so worth it!!", "Potentially also why they\u2019ve said they didn\u2019t drink at all, just mom and mom\u2019s friend did.", "Exactly. Which like, we\u2019re not narcs lol not going to blame the kid for the shitty parent. That\u2019s so"]}
