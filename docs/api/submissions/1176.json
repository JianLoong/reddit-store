They were going to go by car, late this evening.\nI said, alright! The he starts saying that it's so sudden and he doesn't want to go so far. As they'll be coming back by tomorrow. So I advised him if he's not comfortable going away then he should politely refuse his friend. As one should always learn to say know of something makes them uncomfortable.\nHe says that he said no a number of times. But his friend is still insisting him to go with him.\nThis is not the first time though, my bf hardly says no to anyone unless it's me. lol, Infuriates me.\nHe has cancelled plans with me a number of times when some friend or colleague of his had asked him to go with them for some work. I've gotten mad at this. Told him that he can't do this every time. Sometimes it's understandable but not everytime. but well it still happens even after him promising me.\n\nAnyway I very well knew that even though he's saying that he doesn't want to go, he'd still go. Which isn't a problem anyway.\nI kept telling him that if you feel like travelling then go with him but if you don't feel comfortable then simply don't go.\nAnd we hung up the call as his friend came to his home. \n\n3 hours later, I kept waiting for an update. And still nothing. \nthen I called him, asking that if they're going as it was night and I was a bit worried because Indian roads are not best to drive on at night.\nAnd he says yeah we're on our way. I know it doesn't sound much but it suddenly infuriated me that he didn't even drop a single text that they're leaving or anything.\nHe wasn't even driving.\nHe kept saying he doesn't want to go. He's uncomfortable going so far by car. \nAnd when he actually goes after all those awful excuses which I don't even why he was making, he doesn't even do a courtesy to simply drop a single text saying that they're leaving.\n\nSuch little things have happened earlier in really awful situations. Maybe that might be the reason of me being infuriated.\nI'm really mad at him but I feel like I shouldn't be.

He said he's busy. I got mad at him for this. And told him that why would he make up stories if he was actually going to go. It's always better to say things that you want to do.\nIt bugs me when people can't talk in straight forward manner. And it made me feel like that he thinks I will control him if simply wants to go.\nI'm not that person. It's his life and decisions. I just don't like to be deemed as an idiot.\nI did tell him all of this and I'm still infuriated and thinking of taking a bigger step. All of this sounds so childish and minor so I feel like maybe I'm acting like an asshole or idiot. I don't know. but the reason for such  anger because I have been through these things a lot with him.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
