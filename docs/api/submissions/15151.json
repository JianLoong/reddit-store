It was just a simple argument. We're sisters, we're bound to argue. Anne, being pregnant and extremely hormonal overreacted about the whole thing and even went so far as to transfer me to another store. If we werent as low staffed, i wouldnt be surprised if she had fired me.\n\nAnyway, Betty saw that we were arguing and stopped talking to me and had nothing to do with me. Because of this, I changed my Crunchyroll password, so her daughter couldn't use it.

NTA either way.", "NTA. You should be changing every password you have on a regular basis anyway.", "NTA.\n\nAlso good on you for finding another job and quitting.\n\nHopefully you will also be able to find some new friends that actually have your back and support you\u2026 just sayin.", "NTA. Dont even need to read the whole thing. It is you account so you decide who gets to stay.  Thats it. That is all that should be said.", "She's acting like it because i accidentally slipped up about her being pregnant to someone (which is what caused the argument). I told them to keep quiet about it and I let her know and apologised and that's how she dealt with it.", "Preedit comment: It's telling that it isn't included.\n\nEdit: at the time this was written there were no additional details on what the sister and her fought about. Typically, when these threads leave out critical information, it's usually something that radically changes the narrative.\n\nIn this case, it doesn't. The blowup from sister is actually disproportionate while the OP was pretty stand-up and honest about it.\n\nUpdating vote to NTA. Thanks to folks who commented allowing me to circle back.", "Why should she give them a heads up?  It's her login to an anime site, which anyone can pay $14.99 to sign up for. It's not like she's dropping them from her phone plan or something.", "Mom vibes on this one", "No, it isn't. She replied above.", "Could have. Not should have.", "Because she shared her passcode for the child\u2019s sake.  The child did nothing wrong.  A heads up would be the right thing to do.", "Not really? You're allowed to have or not have a relationship with anyone you want, but why expect free help from someone you've iced out of your life.\n\nEven if it was the most deserved ghosting in the world, losing access to Crunchyroll is just the cost of cutting ties here.", "Keeping your own accounts private?\n\nNTA\n\nDon't share passwords in the future.", "NTA, you\u2019re paying.", "Thank you and I think I need to find friends my own age, aha. I appreciate your comment", "I only share passwords because I want my subscriptions to be used when I'm not using them, as I go through phases with what service I watch", "I think the judgement should be based on who the \"someone\" is. If they are an abusive relative or a boss who might fire them. I can see her going off.", "I still suggest that you keep your passwords to yourself, so situations like these don't arise.", "The \"someone\" is another employee that they both saw as a son. He was also my best friend at the time.", "You're right, thanks for letting me know! I'll update my post.", "Ah, thanks for the reply on that. Still doesn't change the verdict! I've done the ol' password change on people before.", "So you disclosed her pregnancy to someone at work after being told no to, and you're surprised that you got punished at work for breaking the rules at work?", "OP didn't \"break the rules at work\". Keeping her pregnancy a secret has nothing to do with their workplace. It was a personal issue and while OP is wrong for telling the friend, OP's sister abused her power at work to punish her for it.", "That's 100% a work issue. An employee nonconsensually disclosed the pregnancy of one employee to another employee at work. \n\nPregnancy is a protected class under employment laws. If someone reveals their pregnancy to a coworker and asks them not to tell, and the coworkers tells anyways, that is workplace harassment.", "I say this as a lawyer who from time to time handles employment discrimination claims: At least under US law, this not rise to the level of \"workplace harassment.\"", "Can tell her to use a free website that also has dubbed anime. i use it all the time.\n\n[9anime](http://9animetv.to)\n\nEdit: i changed the website to put the correct one.", "NTA. That was a gross overreaction on your sisters part.\n\nOn another subject, I recently just finished Attack on Titans on Crunchyroll, and OMG so good. Can you recommend some others that you enjoyed watching?", "It does if she continues or it becomes part of a pattern. \n\nBut it's also not workplace harassment to transfer OP for breaking the rules at work. \n\n\nI'm just trying to explain to this idiot that any actions tou perform  AT WORK are obviously a workplace issue.", "The response which I responded didn't have all those qualifiers.  You claimed one instance of one employee sharing personal info that the manager asked not be shared was workplace harassment.  My response was focused on that claim.  It is not.\n\nI however agree with you that it is a \"workplace issue.\" If you had said that the first time, rather than misstating standards for pregnancy discrimination law, I wouldn't have responded at all.\n\nEdited to correct misstatement that was kindly and patiently pointed out to me -- I wrote this to refer to an \"original response\" that was not, in fact, the \"original response.\"", "NTA", "ESH, you were kind of petty about it imo. \n\nIf the kid's usage didn't affect you in any way, you just removed her access as a petty way to get back at Betty. Kinda childish and unnecessary if you ask me. \n\nLike yeah, ultimately the account is yours and you can do what you want with it, but definitely ask yourself \"why\" you did this. I don't think it's because you had a problem with Betty's daughter, you just did this to exert what little control you had in order to impact their household in a minute but still negative way.", "ESH. You all sound insufferable.", "NTA. Personally I would have just left it because it\u2019s not like the kid did anything to you. You\u2019re \u201cpunishing\u201d a teenager over the actions of her parent. But it\u2019s your account, and you\u2019re not an ass for not wanting someone else to use it.", "I really enjoyed Hunter x Hunter!", "I agree with this tbh. I almost went with ESH because of how easily OP is willing to punish a child over what their parents do. It doesn\u2019t take away anything from the actual person that they fought with. It\u2019s just denying access to someone who didn\u2019t do anything wrong, it\u2019s meant to make OP feel good, even if it\u2019s nonsensical. \n\nBut hey, it\u2019s their account so..", "I agree with you rabbit. Be kind, share accounts save money. I use my parents Netflix and they use my Disney+", "Your argument sounds like charity is bad because some people try to abuse it.", "OP didn\u2019t break any rules and you obviously didn\u2019t read their comment saying they ACCIDENTALLY told someone about it. It wasn\u2019t on purpose it was an accident and OP apologized for doing that but OP\u2019s sister has no right to go off and cause an argument like that over a small mistake that anyone can make. It\u2019s the sister\u2019s fault not OP.\n\nAnd NTA OP, it\u2019s your account that your paying for and you owe Betty\u2019s daughter nothing. Don\u2019t feel bad about this or that your the AH, you have every right to do that. I\u2019ve done it before when I let someone I\u2019m not friends with anymore use my account and they got upset but then ended up having their parents help pay for it. If Betty\u2019s daughter is that upset she can pay for it herself instead of getting mad at you like that.", "What is this reply? Doing something on a personal level should not warrant work related retaliation. This is actually a labor law issue since the \u201cmanagers\u201d are mistreating their direct reports due to a PERSONAL issue. Not work related- definitely shouldn\u2019t be treating someone you manage like this AT ALL. If this is in the US, that is. Working with family is garbage. My husband works for his family and the amount of unprofessional behavior is mind-boggling. The lines are very blurred. \n\nOP, NTA. However- your managers who happen to also be related to you or friends with you- are incredibly unprofessional, immature, and major assholes. Stinky ones.", "That's just like, your opinion man", "Doing it at work/with a coworker is what warrants it", "NTA. Betty thought she could act in solidarity with your sister and forgot that her child was benefitting from your generosity and kindness. Cursing you out, and attacking you further, instead of asking whether you would restore access for her child shows how little Betty thought of you and how little she appreciated your generosity. Betty is not a nice person, and let's hope your sister finds that out sooner rather than later.", "NTA. Problem solved, right?  You are now working somewhere else and will no longer entwined with these relationships.  If course you have rights over your account.", "NTA", "NTA. Isn't crunchy roll basically free?", "NTA - but y\u2019all need to grow up", "NTA. I would have changed my password too.", "What genres do you like?", "It's not much of a punishment when her Assistant Manager mom (Betty) could easily pay for an account since she holds OP in such low regard. For that matter, Anne could get her friend's daughter an account since they've decided to stop speaking to OP and block her. This isn't vindictive. This is common sense. If you don't want anything to do with someone, why should you expect to benefit from their resources?", "Do you think this manager would transfer her employee out and then let her assistant manager harass her about a crunchy roll account if it wasn\u2019t personal? \n\nThere is your blurred line. This is retaliation for a personal issue."]}
