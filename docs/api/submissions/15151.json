Anne and Betty have been working together for about 14 years and they're inseparable.\n\nBetty told me about her daughter liking anime and having to go on websites to watch animes that weren't on Netflix, so I offered to let her use my Crunchyroll account, because I have premium. \n\nA few months later, Anne and I were arguing. It was just a simple argument. We're sisters, we're bound to argue. Anne, being pregnant and extremely hormonal overreacted about the whole thing and even went so far as to transfer me to another store. If we werent as low staffed, i wouldnt be surprised if she had fired me.\n\nAnyway, Betty saw that we were arguing and stopped talking to me and had nothing to do with me. Because of this, I changed my Crunchyroll password, so her daughter couldn't use it.

You should be changing every password you have on a regular basis anyway.", "NTA.\n\nAlso good on you for finding another job and quitting.\n\nHopefully you will also be able to find some new friends that actually have your back and support you\u2026 just sayin.", "NTA. Dont even need to read the whole thing. It is you account so you decide who gets to stay.  Thats it. That is all that should be said.", "She's acting like it because i accidentally slipped up about her being pregnant to someone (which is what caused the argument). I told them to keep quiet about it and I let her know and apologised and that's how she dealt with it.", "Preedit comment: It's telling that it isn't included.\n\nEdit: at the time this was written there were no additional details on what the sister and her fought about. Typically, when these threads leave out critical information, it's usually something that radically changes the narrative.\n\nIn this case, it doesn't. The blowup from sister is actually disproportionate while the OP was pretty stand-up and honest about it.\n\nUpdating vote to NTA. Thanks to folks who commented allowing me to circle back.", "Why should she give them a heads up?  It's her login to an anime site, which anyone can pay $14.99 to sign up for.
