You're presumably an adult; you don't have to do HVAC because your dad says so. You just have to do *something*. So do something else. I legitimately understand the not wanting to get up early thing. I function better on night shifts myself. Go get CNA certified and work overnights at an assisted living or nursing home. Find a nighttime warehouse job. Be a server. Work at a Walmart or a 7-eleven or something. There are tons of night jobs and realistically, a lot of them are being worked by people without a college degree, so what's stopping you? I mean, HVAC might *pay* better than most of those jobs. It seems like it would. If you need to make more money, then you might have to suck up the morning shifts for now. If that doesn't matter, though, then really - just go work somewhere that's actually hiring for night shifts. \n\nIt's not that you can never ever suggest doing jobs a new way or on a new schedule, but listen, you're not at that stage in your working life. You're also not exactly being an innovator here, you're just trying to make working more convenient for you. You might be a better worker on a night shift, fair enough, but jobs don't work that way. Especially entry-level, no experience jobs that your dad gets you. You either need to adjust to the job as it is or go find one that works better for you. Go do something for awhile where you can show up on time and do a good job, then maybe if you have a real innovative idea, someone will actually take you seriously. )Maybe. And maybe not - it just kind of sucks out here sometimes. But that's life. But your chances are better if you show you can perform the job as it is first.) \n\nYour problem isn't that your boss is stuck kn the 19th century, your problem is that you need to either take some initiative to at least get yourself into a job that offers shifts you can deal with, or, if you'd rather just do the job your dad got you instead of trying to find your own path, you need to accept the realities of the current job. Your problem is you. You are YTA in this situation, but you're not even a major AH here or anything, you just need to look around and figure out how the world works before you start thinking you:?'re this great change agent with cool innovative ideas.

Work places aren\u2019t a democracy and when you are starting at the bottom you don\u2019t have the say or experience to affect change in the way you may think. HVAC or other trades just might not be a great fit for you. If you are having an issue with your schedule look for a different field for right now. You are not going to be in a position to cause change when you\u2019re not in some kind of authority position which you\u2019re not going to get to right away. It doesn\u2019t always fee fair but there is a lot more that you wouldn\u2019t see when it comes to the considerations of your schedule and others that you wouldn\u2019t fully understand without experience. Part of surviving in a job is finding one that you can cope with and succeed at while also building knowledge and experience that will hopefully extend to more opportunities. Also I urge you to get a job where your boss isn\u2019t a phone call away from your parents, it would be beneficial for you to truly experience work and other adult decisions on your own as much as you can.

And it\u2019s bloody annoying and shouldn\u2019t be said once.", "WHAT?!", "He\u2019s a new employee. It\u2019s usually an insurance liability, not to mention just generally not a great idea, to let a new employee work on their own without supervision.", "Everyone says whatnot, but no one asks *how*not", "What I love about it is that it's not even like youthful slang; I don't know if I'd call it dated, but I don't think I hear it very often. I mean, I use it occasionally, but then I also use terms like *lest.*", "No we all have to bee off the site at 1:30 for like electricians to come wire but I could do my stuff even with them around", "Yes I turned in my work everyday but they would never let us redo assignments when all the other schools allowed it so it was it was only our school that got screwed.

I truly refuse to believe anyone could possibly be that dense", "His dad was likely okay with him not going to college because his dummy lazy butt would not have gotten accepted or made it through.

You're lazy. And entitled enough to think you should get paid for hours you didn't even work too.", "Your boss has been at this a long time.  There are other things you're not thinking about.  For example, if everyone has to be offsite because of the electricians and you're proposing doing your work somewhere else, there are serious insurance and liability issues at play.  You have to prove yourself trustworthy and work your way up, understand why things are the way they are before you think you're smarter than everyone and can make changes to the whole system.  I know Covid was hard  - it was hard on everyone.  But crises happen.  Everyone's world gets turned upside down at some point.  You have resources now.  You have housing and a dad to help you.  That won't always be there in a crisis.  Please try and take advantage of it.\n\nETA that Covid was no doubt hard on your boss too.  I imagine he's still trying to recover financially from it. He's out there working to get back on track. It was also hard on the teachers you are dunking on. Probably harder than you'll ever know. You gotta respect other people and not think everyone is either out to get you or being stupid. You've had a chance to recover a bit and now you're being given another chance. Again - show up and take advantage of it.", "But why let you do that when they can just hire someone who will do the job the way they want and whatnot", "Nope.  Those electricians don\u2019t want you in the way, especially if your boss has to babysit your ass.", "But finishing at 1.30 means like you get the rest of the day and whatnot to sleep or whatnot? I'd rather that then get up later and miss out on the rest of the day or whatnot.\n\nHave you considered getting a job working exclusively nightshifts, or shift patterns? Something like a factory role would be right up your lazy assed alley!", "It\u2019s telling you\u2019re only responding to the bits about school. At some point it\u2019s your fault. You are not the wronged party in every interaction.", "You do realize life doesn\u2019t let you redo?

No!", "NAT WHOT", "I can only respond to questions or it\u2019s considered arguing with judgment", "These are both legitimately really good suggestions.", "My ideal sleep schedule is 2 AM to 10 AM.\n\nAnd yet here I am, forcing myself into a bed 3-4 hours earlier than I\u2019d like and using a sunrise alarm clock to try and make this just a little easier, all because my employer says I should be in the office by 8:30 at the latest for a job that is notorious for requiring more than 40 hours a week.\n\nI\u2019m not lazy.
