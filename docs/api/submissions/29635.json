Might sound a bit radical, but this sounds to me to be near prostitution.", "At those prices you can probably afford several nicer girlfriends. NTA.", "NTA \n\n\"She claimed she has been struggling financially because she still has tuition debt.\" \n\nFunny that someone who is struggling financially has need for 7000 jewellery!? \n\n Maybe you should try date girl who reciprocate with grand gesture (doesn't always be money) .

She owes you for that vacation and I\u2019m assuming much much more. $7000 is a huge amount of money and if she\u2019s struggling financially then she needs to be saving up and not buying things she does not need.", "Absolutely NTA. Nobody needs $7,000 jewelry.

Refuse this time and see what she does. If she accepts it then you know she's in the relationship for you. If she gets upset, throws a tantrum, leaves/ignores you or tries to bribe you with sx then she's likely just in it for the money and you should really decide if that's the kind of relationship you want.", "christ and here I felt like an asshole for linking my girlfriend to a $50 necklace that I want for christmas\n\nNTA. please break up with her", "No.  You are being taken advantage of financially.

But he did, and often they were just as wonderful gifts because he made the effort (chocolates, flowers, a birthday necklace that cost likely 1% of that price). We were also a couple years older than you at this time.\n\nDon\u2019t throw your hard earned money away on people that don\u2019t appreciate you and only see you as a means to get stuff they want.

She is treating you like a wallet. Why are you still dating her? \n\nStop spending any money on her and see how she reacts- my guess is that she at the very least insult or argue with you, at the most she will start looking for the next man who I be her wallet, and she will break up with you when she finds him.

That $10k is your emergency fund, not for frivolous things like a bit of metal and a rock or two.\n\nThere is no way I would loan 70% of my net worth to \\*anyone\\* unless I had ... actually, no, scratch that, it's never gonna happen in any circumstance.\n\nUnless you get on the same page on finance and spending, this relationship will end up on the rocks at some point. Serious conversations need to be had if this is to continue.\n\nETA after reading your other responses, this sounds like borderline abuse - denial of intimacy, not keeping commitments to repay money lent, your poor mental health, and this latest request. I don't think this is healthy at all and you need some time apart to evaluate whether this relationship is good for you and worth keeping.", "Cut her off.

By having you pay for everything she is able to use her money as she sees fit.  Ultimately, when you finally stop the bleeding and end the relationship she will have acquired personal property, experiences, and reduced her debt.  \n\nKnowing this you have to decide if the money you are spending is worth the time you get to be with her.", "Stand up for yourself. This is shit testing to see how much you will bend. This will get worse dude.", "NTA. You are an atm to her, not a boyfriend. Any money you give her is fine, you\u2019ll never get it back.

You deserve a more considerate partner.", "If you \"lend\" her that money and expect it back, you're an idiot.", "NTA. 70% of your savings?

Is just having limits.", "NTA!\n\nIt would be a lot of cash even if you had it to spare, let alone when it's 70% of your savings and goind for something as superfluous as jewelry. It is even worse when you consider she thinks it is a good idea to buy a luxury item while in debt. This is a nightmare waiting to happen. She is willing to go deeper into dept for something like that? Makes me question her intentions here...", "7000$ for jewelry. Wooow.\nYou need to step back for a bit and think things through in your relationship. Do you love her or you love the idea that you have someone (the companionship)? \n probably have a breather from your relationship to reassess things about yourself, the relationship and how you want a relationship to be. \nIf she does love you, she would understand why you can't give her the money.\nShe also might need to start earning for herself too.\n\nSo, NTA.", "I see why you would say that, but I am afraid it is even worse: We have not even been intimate in months...

I do think, however, that this relationship and how your gf acts entitled to your money is one of the potential reasons for your confidence being so low.\n\nYou're more than a wallet and relationships are more than a one sided financial burden.

Also, is she the one making your confidence low? \n\nSomething I\u2019ve learned in my 40 years, never tell people how much money you have saved.
