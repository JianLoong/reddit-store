This happen today and still has me feeling upset as well as that I was being an a\\*\\*h\\*\\*\\*. Posting here for the first time so sorry about grammar and spelling.\n\nSo today started out bad. I woke up to fine that I had not been paid this week.  I work for a staffing agency that pays weekly. So I texted Lolo (not real name) who was suppose to be in charge of all of the team members in the city. He told me to talk a boss, James (not real name),  that was back. I was told James was no longer with the company some time back . Text messages went as follows:\n\nme- \"(Lolo) I didn't get my pay stub or paycheck this week for the work I did last week. Can you look into this for me as to why?\" (me)\n\n\" I am (me). I am working at the (work site)\"\n\nLolo- \"I am not in (city). Please call (James) \"\n\n\"He is back\"\n\nme- \"Okay just know how piss off I am at the massive lack of communication on things that are important.\"\n\nLolo- \"What are you talking about\"\n\n\"Who's lack of communication\"\n\nme-  \"Your lack and (James)'s. When it comes to who to text/call if something comes up. I need to know which of you will be available before hand. Not find out the day something happens. Is a group text or email really that hard to send out?\"\n\nLolo- \"Frist of all you text today at 5:33am. It is 7am and I responded. If you expect for us to be waiting for your text I'm sorry but this is not going to happen. Also I will ensure you have website and login so you can get you own pay stop bus. The emails you receive weekly come from corporate not us locally.\n\nLast if you have a problem please talk to or myself. Sending a text you are PISSED OFF is extremely unprofessional and hope you are not speaking that way to my team.\"\n\nI didn't  say in any text for them to get back to me asap.  It is common for any reply to come later on in the day. I was pissed off because I was not told about the change in contact until today. Who to contact, including numbers and email, is very important and should be kept up to date so issues are handled by the right person(s). Given what was going on I stated things within the mean of acceptable. Lolo's last text upset me that by the time I arrived to work I was crying. I found out that Lolo and James hadn't told the work site HR or Manger about the change in contact information either.\n\nI know I did the right thing by letting the work site HR, Manger, and supervisor know what was going on. It gave them a heads up on what might happen with other team members who are also apart of the same company as me. Even so I still feel like an a\\*\\*h\\*\\*\\*. I  know I shouldn't let it get to me so much and I hate myself for letting it get to me in the first place. I am posting this because I feel like I need to get it off my chest but AITA here like I feel I am?\n\nNote: All texts are as quoted. I do feel bad about being unable to face the work day.

Sure, sounds like they may have mishandled things as well. But you overreacted about the name/responsibility changes, maybe due to your frustration with the paystub problems.", "I will also say sorry here because there is a whole lot more to this story that due to the 3000 c count I could not fit in. Feel free to ask if you feel like there is something that isn't fully clear about my posting.", "YTA", "Believe it or not I wasn't frustrated about the paystub thing at all. And this company works mostly thou text from boss to team members. Because of this the other boss was fine with team member texting him at any time of day or night when there was a issue of any kind. They don't reply any sooner or later if I were to text at 10am or noon then texting at 2 am in the morning."]}
