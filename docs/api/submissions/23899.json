May God bless you.", "NTA", "NTA that's abuse (neglect is abuse). Protect those kids. \n\n Children are not toys or objects that belong to their parents to do with whatever they want, they are small humans with decades less life experience and decades less coping skills and knowledge who need love and guidance and being neglected while your parents get wasted isn't being loved or cared for or guided to do anything\n\n they are through neglect teaching those kids that their needs and joy don't matter which will take them a lifetime to recover from.\n\nIt sucks that the father is encouraging this and making her worse but she also has responsibility to those children and she's not putting them first so I'd consider trying to get guardianship or see if another family member can because this neglect will traumatise those kids if it hasn't already\n\nEdit I reread and you do have custody, good on you for stepping up like that", "Absolutely NTA.

They're just going for the easy scapegoat instead of the AH parents who neglected their kid and they all sat idly by and let it happen. Your niece is safe now, that should have been their priority.

Better to have some family be angry at you rather than them have to attend a small child\u2019s funeral.

Are you willing to continue to do this for her future siblings?", " Anyone in the family who thinks you were wrong needs a few facts thrown down in front of them.", "Yeah, if it was true that would be an idiotic question. Unless she'd write this only to brag what a good person she is to save a child.", "Yep exactly. Sneaky OP. It\u2019s fine to roleplay and make up stories in your head, but don\u2019t lie about serious situations. If either of these are actually real, then lying about the other is really, really bad considering the type of situations it is.", "Yeah OP made it sound as if she was smoking weed, spice or crack or something. Not just \u2018smoking\u2019. It\u2019s as if OP has no idea about the different kinds of drugs there are that you can smoke and think only nicotine is for smoking. I think OP might be an attention seeking teen."]}
