Which means of the bio parents would put in the work, instead of bitching about you, they get their daughter back.\n\nSo tell the family that think it\u2019s wrong that they me ok with child abuse and neglect but your not.

Thank goodness someone cares about this child!!!!!!! Keep up the good work taking care of her!!!!", "NTA. You were/are proactive, you see what is going to happen with this child and you prevented it. \n\nYou saved her from a living hell. You are an AMAZING person! May God bless you.", "NTA", "NTA that's abuse (neglect is abuse). Protect those kids. \n\n Children are not toys or objects that belong to their parents to do with whatever they want, they are small humans with decades less life experience and decades less coping skills and knowledge who need love and guidance and being neglected while your parents get wasted isn't being loved or cared for or guided to do anything\n\n they are through neglect teaching those kids that their needs and joy don't matter which will take them a lifetime to recover from.\n\nIt sucks that the father is encouraging this and making her worse but she also has responsibility to those children and she's not putting them first so I'd consider trying to get guardianship or see if another family member can because this neglect will traumatise those kids if it hasn't already\n\nEdit I reread and you do have custody, good on you for stepping up like that", "Absolutely NTA. Both parents abandoned the kid for 1 week. Evidently, they are not fit.", "You\u2019re saving the baby from having traumas. Good job but it\u2019s a double edged sword since they could get the child back at some point and cut you off.", "Courts don't go around ripping children from loving homes, and certainly not loving homes with *both* parents. How shit did her niece's homelife have to be for this to have happened?", "She was a chain smoker  it was really bad.", "Either they are leaving lots of things out, have some sort of temporary custody or it is pure BS.", "Yeah there\u2019s something a bit wrong about this post, getting custody of a kid isn\u2019t as easy as just going to court and leaving with the kid", "It\u2019s is off\u2026 it\u2019s a made up story.", "Well saying as OP just deleted another post they made about uninviting husband\u2019s family from their wedding and saying she\u2019s a 25F, I *think* you sniffed out the BS correctly.", "It\u2019s pure BS\u2026. It\u2019s exactly as you say, it isn\u2019t exactly as easy getting custody of a child that isn\u2019t even yours.\n\nOP writes fake posts, she had another one with issues at her wedding with her MIL where she was stopped from having her wedding at the church in front of the cemetery where her dad is, that was she was was 26.

You saved the kid.", "NTA. If they were fit parents, you wouldn't have gotten custody. Their feelings don't matter. Only Jaya matters.", "NTA, You saved that child.\nThe parents CAN change, but they weren't. They kept up bad habits and only enhanced them with their daughter around, it was child neglect. They did not love their child, you saved her.", "NTA.\n\nYou did what is best for the kid, which is what should always be done. Those are your sister's mistakes. You'll give the kid a better chance at life than she would have, and it's a great thing that you did.", "nta, better to have half your family upset at you then leave a child in a harmful living situation. Court wouldn't give you custody unless they thought it was an issue.", "NTA", "Something is definitely off. When a concerned Redditor asked what the sister was smoking, OP just replied that she was a chain smoker, and that it was \"really bad.\"\n\nCigarette smoking... isn't...yeah. Dude. The post implied drugs when there were none \n\nAnd if she were heavily drinking throughout the entire pregnancy, there would likely be mentions of FAS or a NICU stay for NAS.\n\nEverything is purposely vague, but the cigarette thing struck me.", "Even from somewhat unfit parents. Courts will try to avoid retiring custody from parents at all costs. The situation was clearly awful and unsustainable.", "100% believe it's BS\n\nI just don't understand *why* people write up BS stuff. \n\nI delete half of my comments because I can't be bothered to type out the whole thing."]}
