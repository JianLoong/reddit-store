So when I came over, my friend greeted me, after some time of hanging out, we were going to put out pj\u2018s on cause we had to sleep soon, so I asked my friend if she could give me one just like she told me. \n\nShe said yes, so she gave me one. It looked weird. But I thought nothing of it. So I went to the bathroom to put it on and I was terrified when I realized how it looks like. You need to know, I\u2019m Jewish. I am a Jew and I\u2019m very proud of my heritage and religion, and the pajama she gave me looked like the Jews wore in THAT camp back then. When I came back into her room wearing it, she started to laugh at me and even begun to throw money at me. If you didn\u2019t know, a common stereotype against Jews is that we\u2018re money hungry and often steal money or jewelry. I felt violated, so I begun to tear up. \nShe than had the audacity to say it was just a joke and that I should get over it. When we had to go to sleep, I didn\u2019t sleep. I waited for her to fall asleep, and luckily she\u2018s a heavy sleeper. I took off the pajama and put my normal clothes on, I than packed my things and left. I didn\u2018t tell her or her mom cause I just wanted to get out of there. I ran home, crying and feeling dirty for wearing that awful clothing cause my friend refused to give me anything else. When I came home, I banged at the door of the apartment where I lived cause I didn\u2019t have my key with me, I woke up my whole family and when they saw me with red puffy eyes and with all my stuff they were worried. When I told them what happened they were furious, they told me to cut contact with her. Not to mention, her mom, didn\u2019t care either. So the next day, my parents and I went to my friends house and my parents wanted an explanation of how someone could let something hurtful like this slide and not teach their kid it\u2019s wrong. Her mum just said it was a joke which just made my parents more mad, saying it\u2019s not a joke and that it\u2019s bullying and anti semitism. We than left after the argument, my friend texted me saying I\u2019m a baby for leaving and that getting my parents involved for a joke was stupid. I just blocked her everywhere and cut contact with her after that whole incident. \n\n I didn\u2019t want to stay friends with a girl who has violated me and thought it was funny. Being anti semitic isn\u2019t funny. And making me wear that being fully aware what it will remind me off and knowing I\u2019m Jewish is disgusting. That wasn\u2019t the only anti semitic thing she did to me, and even if it was, it would still be horrible and fucked up. I never spoke about her other horrible anti semitic things cause I was scared, I was scared of her. During our friendship she\u2019d also tell me things like \u201eoh yeah h..ler was a genius\u201c or brag about how her old grandfather was a n.zi. I\u2019m just glad to be out of this friendship.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693466534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16643qv/aita_for_just_leaving_a_sleepover_without_saying/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
