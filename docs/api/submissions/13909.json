However, it's possible that in your efforts to smooth things over with the future in-laws, you may have overstepped a bit. Calling someone to tell them to \"calm the f**k down\" is never a great idea, even if they're being unreasonable. It's understandable that the groom would be upset about that, and he probably felt like you were taking sides against his family.\n\nThat being said, it's also clear that the future in-laws were causing a lot of drama, and you were just trying to keep everything running smoothly. It's unfortunate that the groom took his frustration out on you, and his family's behavior towards you was completely uncalled for. In the end, it's up to the bride and groom to decide how to handle their respective families, and it's not fair for anyone to blame you for their issues. So no, you're NTA, but it might be worth reflecting on how you can handle similar situations in the future without escalating things.", "NTA", "ESH, you don't seem to deny telling MOG to call the fuck down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I traveled to come to the wedding. The bride wanted me to come a few days early to help with things. I stayed at their house and then we traveled together to the wedding site.  I was supposed to stay the wedding night with the bride. The groom made me leave because he wanted sex and I had to find another place to stay. \n\nFrom the groom's point of view: I arrived Wednesday, I rode in the car with them for 4 hours to get to the wedding, I took up her time doing the hair and makeup trial on Thursday, I took her away on Friday for the bachelorette and was in her room the wedding night. I was then with her the entire morning of the wedding. He didn't have an opportunity to be alone with her for a few days before the wedding and likely wanted to have some time to reflect with her.

Do you all vacate the dance floor if the bride and groom step on it? Do you studiously avoid looking at them or dancing near them all night?
