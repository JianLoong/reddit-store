She had saved the top of the cast and like a decade later brought it to me at my apartment in a different state. I threw it in the dumpster and she must have dumpster dived for it because it was in her house in yet another state. At one point my brother was helping me clean things and he brought down a small white jewelry box and said: Three guesses for what\u2019s in here. I immediately said \u201cteeth\u201d and he asked me how I knew. I found his old broken retainer, gallstones in a jar, and my favorite - her toenail clippings in a baggie with a note about it being her DNA. Like WTAF? Cleaning that house out was a year in bizarro land. \n\nAnd ironically, this was the same woman who had to clean out her own parent\u2019s house and went on about the shit she found there (bags of dog hair from whenever she brushed the dogs, and a massive collection of disintegrating flip flops and kewpie dolls). \n\nWhen she was alive she saw nothing wrong with how she lived and accused me of trying to steal all her memories \u2026 both incredibly sad and frustrating at the same time.", "Exactly, if you know there's a quarter in the family you have to get a hold of the valuables otherwise they will be lost in the horde"]}
