After a while of this I just handled my own mess. Second I was done with a dish I used I cleaned mine and let his pile up in the sink.

If it were a one-time situation where she just was done for the day and needed to get out and blow off some steam, fine, but this has been ongoing and it is a change in behavior from previous months when she would do the task. I know some people feel that your response was paternal, but one aspect of a partnership is mutual respect and communication which she has clearly discarded. \n\nIt seems like she realizes that if she doesn't do it, you will eventually, and she's taking advantage of that. It's childish, but it is a behavior likely attached to a feeling that needs to be examined. If it's as simple as she hates doing dishes, offer a chore trade.
