I know some people feel that your response was paternal, but one aspect of a partnership is mutual respect and communication which she has clearly discarded. \n\nIt seems like she realizes that if she doesn't do it, you will eventually, and she's taking advantage of that. It's childish, but it is a behavior likely attached to a feeling that needs to be examined. If it's as simple as she hates doing dishes, offer a chore trade.

Living together means splitting chores.", "Technically not the asshole because you don't have to facilitate your car but the fact that you're even thinking of the verb \"to allow\" changes that to YTA. You don't get to allow or forbid your girlfriend anything. And if she doesn't want to do the dishes before going out, you can't make her either. You can: a) do them, b) leave them until she gets back and does them, c) get a dishwasher, d) get a cleaning lady, e) break up with her and move out.", "Yes, you are", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Took my ex boyfriend 10 months to show me who he really was.", "EXACTLY!!! My frame of mind is to get up and get after it. I love seeing my home clean and knocking things off my checklist. The responsibilities are there regardless. There is no sense in waiting around for your partner to do something when you could have accomplished the task in the time it took you to brood and nag over them, not getting to it first. It feels so rewarding to accomplish tasks. It makes me feel good helping my partner. It makes me feel loved when my partner helps me. We definitely have different skill sets and enjoy some chores more than others. We are aware of each others standards for a task being completed well. We account for that and make it work. If my partner wasn't around, the chores would still be there. We have certain standards for ourselves and our home. I'm glad we simply step up when we see something needs to be done. Standards for maintaining a home gotta match!", "Well this is depressing."]}
