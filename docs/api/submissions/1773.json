Of course, he has his whole setup (massage table, sheets, lotions, etc.) \n\nI told her that he was watching the game in our bedroom and that the game isn\u2019t over until 8:30ish, but that she should ask him so that he can set up his table and equipment during a commercial break. She told me that she didn\u2019t want a full massage and that she just wanted him to rub her shoulders. I was uncomfortable with that, so I suggested she get a full body massage on the table because it\u2019s more of a professional setting. She got upset and said she did not feel like getting a full massage because she is too sore and that her body wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. She kept pushing it, so I told her that I\u2019m not comfortable with my husband rubbing her shoulders, like how he would rub mine. I told her that it\u2019s inappropriate and that instead of getting defensive, she should respect me and not push it. She asked me what the difference was between a regular shoulder rub and a massage on the table, and again I explained how it\u2019s more of a professional setting. I told her I wasn\u2019t trying to make her feel uncomfortable or awkward, but that she clearly didn\u2019t care if I felt uncomfortable, as she wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer. We began to bicker, and I told her to get a boyfriend or a husband of her own who she can just have randomly rub her shoulders and that if she wants a massage from my husband that he\u2019d have to do it professionally, as he would with any other client.

You offered an explanation and an alternative. That should've been the end of it.", "Did she pay for those massages in the past?", "NTA. I'm assuming he gives her free services? Either way, you aren't wrong for setting boundaries about your husband. She doesn't really get to choose what a man's wife is and isn't comfortable with, especially when that thing involves something that couples commonly do for each other as a form of intimacy. \n\nIf she just wants a shoulder rub she can probably see one of those places in the mall. I'm pretty sure they offer partial massages and she can pay for what she wants. It's entitled to ask that of someone for free and even more so to have a problem when she doesn't get her way.", "NTA. Her asking wasn\u2019t a big deal, but she shouldn\u2019t keep pushing after you said it made you uncomfortable.", "NTA-your husband is a massage therapist yes but that doesn't mean that people can just ask him for a quick massage whenever they want. You set a boundary and she needs to learn to respect it and others you might have in place and just leave it be but no, she kept pushing, she escalated something that could've been left alone.", "Info: did she visit with her sore shoulders specifically to get a free massage?", "NTA.\n\nI'm a female massage therapist and I hate when family and friends pull this shit. It sounds to me like she was just hoping for some free services and I'm put off by how persistent she was. I have both family and friends that think that knowing me means their entitled to free or heavily discounted services and at the drop of a hat. I had a neighbor who knew I only see people by appointment. She calls me up as I'm getting ready to leave in the early evening for a class and demanded that I come over and massage her friend who has just made an 8 hr drive to visit her. \n\nMaybe I just have assholes for friends and family but I've found that in this type of situation you give an inch and they take a mile.", "NTA. Red flag red flag. A best friend would respect your wishes, and she is pushing boundaries in your relationship with your husband", "NTA but it's kind of strange that she was so insistent.\n\nI think you handled it properly, hell even offering (if I'm reading it correctly) a free full body massage. Though you might want to check with your husband next time before offering out his services like that.", "NTA. Setting boundaries is never an AH move as long as you do it respectfully and within reason.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s super weird of your friend to ask your husband to rub her shoulders, regardless if he is a massage therapist. She\u2019s too sore for a full massage? She\u2019s not being reasonable at all.", "NTA \n\nBut I\u2019m confused. I would think her undressing and getting a full massage would be way more intimate than a shoulder rub. I sometimes rub peoples shoulders when they don\u2019t even ask. I rubbed my mom\u2019s shoulders today to comfort her in the nursing home and she\u2019s in a wheelchair because she broke her leg. If I was in this situation, you\u2019re obviously not comfortable with the shoulders so I would not be comfortable with removing my clothes so I would just decline doing either. She should not have kept asking. Maybe she asked once more because of what I said and then again because her shoulders really hurt. I have no idea. But either way you\u2019re lucky you\u2019re married to a man who can do that for you. My ex husband wasn\u2019t terrible at it but he sometimes complained because his hands hurt because he worked with his hands. I had a car accident when I was pregnant so he did try. His grandmother had done that and he had her book from the 1800\u2019s.", "NTA- your friend is being a creep or trying to be cheap. \n\nIt\u2019s a shoulder massage. You could do it too. It\u2019s weird she was being so insistent.", "Nta. I\u2019ve never had a massage so I\u2019m not sure how that goes, but if he massaged her shoulders or whatever it is that she wanted where his setup is would that have worked? Since he would be in his professional setting and all? Or is it specifically her shoulders that you have a problem with?", "NTA\n\nYou told her it was making you uncomfortable. She should have stopped at that point. Next time please ask her to go home if she continues pestering about it and tell her you'd rather her find a different massage therapist going forward.", "NTA \nFirst of all, being on the table wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean a full massage. She could just lay down, clothed if more comfortable, and he could just focus on her shoulders. I\u2019m guessing from the wording in your post that she wouldn\u2019t be paying for this? She needs to respect your boundaries, especially when she\u2019s asking to interrupt his downtime and get a free massage.  \n\nSecond, there is plenty she could do for her sore shoulders. She isn\u2019t entitled to get one from your husband just because he\u2019s given her one before. And definitely not only on her terms. \n\nOut of interest, how does he feel about this kind of thing? Is he generally happy to for friends/family outside of work? What are his boundaries for time and payment, etc?", "Tell her to moderate her workout routine instead of asking for a massage from your husband.\n\nI'm a total asshole.", "ESH. Should he not have been your husband decision since it is his business? It may not have mind not having going out of his way to set up the table for just a small massage... Should she has insisted when you told her he was watching game and relaxing? No.", "YTA. Even in a professional setting, if I asked for a therapist to only work on my shoulders and they kept insisting a full body, I'd be weirded out.\nShe's your best friend and in pain and she PAYS for his services and you just gave her a bunch of shit because apparently a massage table is all that is needed to prevent them from burning with desire and hooking up behind your back? You have issues.", "ESH. I think this is so weird. It's very difficult to judge. Like for most people, a quick shoulder rub targeting a specific knot is way less intimate than laying down on a table. Like you were insisting on escalating the situation but you're pretending that you're deescalating it. You could have just said no. But saying no unless she's willing to lie down on the table and get a full massage is very weird to me. I can see why she was extremely confused. \n\nI think that you are an asshole for pushing the massage that she didn't want, especially while your husband wasn't in the room. You were negotiating an exchange between two people, and one of them wasn't there. It doesn't make sense that you're more comfortable with him giving her a massage than a quick shoulder rub in front of you. It might make sense to you, but I can definitely see why it didn't make sense to her. I do think it's weird that she kept pushing the shoulder rub, but I think that you communicated about it really weirdly.  So I can't even tell if she pushed it because she thought you were okay with it and you weren't explaining yourself well, or what. The part about getting her own boyfriend is also a very weird thing to say when you made it very clear that it was about a professional exchange. Like that was pretty rude. \n\nWould have made a lot more sense for you to just tell her to ask him, and suggest that she offer to pay for it if she wants one. She probably would have shut up, but it wouldn't have been your problem. It's weird that you put yourself in the middle of this. Your husband is who gets to decide what setting is professional, and if you can't trust him to do that, then I imagine his entire career would be a challenge for you.\n\nI'm sure that she walked out of that situation like \"What the fuck just happened?!?\" Like I don't get why you get to negotiate the terms of his professional agreement. You told her to ask him, at that point. It should have been totally up to him. It's weird that you got involved.", "Soft YTA for me. I understand feeling uncomfortable because not everyone feels the same about things but to me a shoulder rub doesn't have to be intimate, especially if you're all friends and trust each other. What pushed you to be an AH for me though was the unnecessary quip about her needing her own boyfriend or husband. Uncalled for and rude.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They're really no reason I can think of for you to say that in any universe.\n\nLike you blatantly say that the problem was that he would be rubbing her shoulders like he rubs your shoulders. Like a husband. But if he's a professional, it would never be like that. And if she's specifically telling you that her body is too sore for a full massage, I think pushing that is weird. Like she's literally telling you that it's going to hurt. It just seems like you said everything but what you really wanted to say, so I could see why she was pushing for clarity, although she should have sensed your discomfort and let it go.", "She knew she\u2019d have to pay for it. She always does and gets a discount. What I\u2019m thinking is that she probably wanted a casual massage to get out of paying. Idk.", "Great. That's actually good to know. But OP specifically talks about insisting on a full back massage. Then the woman says no, that would hurt, I'm too sore for anything but shoulders.\n\nSo a professional masseuse, were they to ask that question and get that answer, would say okay we will just stick to shoulders. A professional masseuse would never insist on doing the rest of the back if it's in pain. But OP did. Then she admits in comments to me that she thought her friend was trying to get away with getting a free massage. But at no point does she ask the friend if she intends on paying, mention that she's discomfort with the blurry boundary around money, or allow her husband to negotiate any of this. She makes a comment about getting her own boyfriend, when there are other people besides boyfriends who give shoulder rubs. You can ask a trusted friend for a shoulder rub, you can ask anyone. But OP acted like only a boyfriend or a husband could give a shoulder rub, and she basically said \"get your own man,\" which is not a thing I would ever say to a friend. That's obviously going to be hurtful. If I was worried about boundaries, we would be having a conversation about boundaries. But this conversation was about a table instead.", "Just because he\u2019s a massage therapist doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s just going to casually massage people. If they want a massage, they can pay for it and get on his table. I told her to get a bf or husband because she kept pestering and because massage therapists don\u2019t just casually rub people at random \u2014 husbands and bf\u2019s do. Massage therapists book appointments.", "Okay, then you're the asshole for assuming that instead of asking. She's been willing to pay before, you have no reason to distrust her that you've discussed here. So what you did was you assumed the worst about her, and then you acted on it without clearly explaining what you were assuming. So that's why you're the asshole. She's an asshole for being pushy, but you're an asshole for doing that. You could have just asked her, but instead you assumed that she was trying to basically scam you. That's not what friends do in the face of ambiguity.", "Friend should never have asked OP if husband would be okay with rubbing her shoulders then. If it really was a professional ask, she would have gone straight to the husband to request. Friend brought OP into the mix herself so cannot turn around and complain that OP has opinions about it. Friend blurred the boundaries here. OP is NTA. This is why friendship and business should rarely mix. Feelings get hurt.", "You could have said \"get an amateur to do it\" or \"get a friend\" or \"get someone else.\" It's not only boyfriends and husbands who give massages. I've had a roommate give me shoulder rubs, I give shoulder rubs to my friends sometimes. Sure, I wouldn't want to have those unclear boundaries if I was a professional. But, there are other people that she could have asked to get a massage from. You chose to make it about a boyfriend or husband. Because he's your husband. And I really think that you were subtly trying to say  \"get your own man, stay away from mine.\" And that was taking things to a pretty unnecessary place.", "Yeah, that\u2019s true. I was like, \u201cGo get a bf or husband of your own.\u201d I didn\u2019t mean to get catty or snappy, but I did\u2026 I feel like shit, man.", "Hey, it's okay. People make mistakes. They apologize, they learn from it, they grow. \n\nI think that you can apologize and explain and work through this one. It's okay to admit that you got a little bit insecure for a minute and felt the need to stake out your territory. It's also important to tell this to your husband, because this could actually impact his business with a client. And he needs to know that he might need to do some damage control if she doesn't accept your apology. My advice is that when you fess up to this, you do it by asking him for advice. Let him know what happened and tell him that in the future you want to do whatever he wants you to do. Tell him you realize that you fumbled the ball a little bit, but you just need his guidance and you're happy to follow it. Then I bet he will tell you you're being too hard on yourself, and thank you for trying to protect his boundaries, give you a tip for how to handle it if it happens again, and give you a hug. At least I hope that's what happens.\n\nIf I was in a situation and realized that I had threatened one of my female friends in regards to her husband, I would not go back to him as my masseuse. I would do that in order to save the friendship at the expense of the professional relationship. So if she does decide to do that, it's not the end of the world. Just own up, and tell her that you understand. \n\nYou may have been an asshole, but she was also being pushy. And everyone is an asshole sometimes. Literally everybody. You were an asshole in this one situation, but that doesn't make you an asshole everywhere. And being able to admit that you were wrong makes you way less of an asshole than half the people who come here. I really hope that your friendship can get through this little hiccup, and that your husband has a fruitful business that brings him joy.", "NTA.\n\nOk I read a lot of comments. And here is my 2 cents.\n\nIt feels very different when you are lying on the massage table and getting a massage, vs a friend or bf rubbing your back.\n\nIt always feels very intimate when a guy is rubbing my back casually, and always feels clinical whenever I\u2019m at a formal massage setting.\n\nIt is not wrong to get a friend to rub your back, but it is totally weird to insist that a friend\u2019s husband rub their back for them in a non-professional setting (unless he is volunteering- then he sounds like a creep, oh hey it never sounds right)\n\nAnyway, lying on the massage bed doesn\u2019t equate to a full body massage. \n\nYou might be a bit mean to ask her to find her own bf, but I sort of agree to the sentiment. (And coming from a permanently unwanted female, it is something)\n\nAsking once is ok, asking more than once and getting pissy about it just places her as really strange, and I really question her motives. If she is a paying customer with a huge discount anyway, she isn\u2019t much of a customer and he can get other normal customers.", "NTA a massage is an intimate service even in a professional setting, so I think it\u2019s important to make clear boundaries. The kind of massage she wants puts your bodies in closer contact than a table massage, so even if she has no secret motive, she should respect the fact that she doesn\u2019t get to have the same wife-massage-privileges you get. She\u2019s being entitled and cheap", "ESH - You\u2019re N T A for stating your boundaries and refusing to back down with your friend. But unless you think that she\u2019s trying to seduce your husband (which it doesn\u2019t sound like you do), telling her to get her own boyfriend or husband was below the belt and judgmental\u2026which makes Y T A. Your friend should have accepted your boundaries as soon as you stated them which makes her the AH.", "[removed]", "NTA. Not only could your friend go to someone else, she could use a heat pack or rub her own shoulders if that\u2019s all she wants anyway. I know it\u2019s not the same, but being so insistent is very strange and off-putting. I would personally be downright creeped out by it.", "My best friend studied to be a massage therapist for a year before moving on to other interests, and that\u2019s something he never tells anyone about, and has forbidden me to tell anyone he knows irl, because once people find out, he has to spend every party/social gathering refusing to give his female friends/GFs of his friends shoulder rubs.", "I agree. Personally, I would never have another man rub my shoulders unless it\u2019s by a professional in a professional setting. I don\u2019t care if the man is a massage therapist. If the setting is not professional, it would feel wrong and inappropriate. I\u2019m definitely an asshole for telling her to go get her own man so that he can massage her like that. I was trying to keep my cool and be as respectful as possible, but she was persistent. If she didn\u2019t see where I was coming from, that\u2019s irrelevant. She didn\u2019t have to see where I was coming from. All she had to do is respect it, and I feel like she wasn\u2019t due to her insisting and continuing to question me why I found it inappropriate. If someone tells me something makes them feel uncomfortable, I don\u2019t push the issue. I say okay and move on. She wouldn\u2019t stop, so I lost my cool. I\u2019m ashamed for that. It was wrong of me to tell her that, as it was wrong of her to keep insisting. It didn\u2019t have to get to that level. It wouldn\u2019t have if she would\u2019ve just respected my boundary when I tried setting it.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

There is a difference between getting on a massage table and getting a massage (full or just shoulder) compared to  sitting in front of the TV and your husband standing behind her massaging her shoulders especially if they are not close friends or related.", "I do understand her perspective to a certain extent. Maybe she feels that she\u2019s already interrupting his downtime, and she\u2019d be inconveniencing him even more by having to set up everything? The time is strange though, it\u2019s a bit rude to ask at that time of night when he\u2019s obviously unwinding and enjoying time off at home.", "Or she could take the damn table if it hurts that much. Like everybody here seems to think that taking the table means full body when it could be the shoulders only. And I agree with OP, making the setting more professional is more appropriate as that's his job. It sounds to me that friend was trying to get a freebie by making it look more casual. \nThe fact that friend didn't ask the husband herself but was asking OP to ask her husband...makes it even clearer for me. If she is a customer of his regularly why not go to the guy himself and say \"hey, would you please help me with this?\" and husband would then decide. The way this was written makes me think that the friend maybe expected that by asking OP to ask her husband it would be more like a favour, done casually, and not having to pay because it's probably just a quick rub.", "This made me snort.\n\nImagine dating a gyne and having a gf pop by, saying I have this weird lump at my vagina, can you have a look at it, then her stripping the bottom half, lying on your table/sofa/somewhere and him poking at it there and then.", "As great as a shoulder rub feels, it also feels more intimate than a full massage. Unless it\u2019s a brief, rub-your-shoulders like you\u2019re about to step into a boxing ring as a joke kind of thing! Definitely something I associate with my partner though. NTA - she didn\u2019t respect your boundaries", "It sounds like she does want to seduce your husband. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to her to mention it. If she was trying to get a freebie, it\u2019s likely that she would say something along those lines instead."]}
