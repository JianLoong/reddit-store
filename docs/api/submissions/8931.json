It\u2019s also incomplete but enough people asked me for an update that I felt I owed it to you guys. \n\nEmma has disappeared. I have not heard from her since the phone call and she stopped showing up to hospital around the first week of January. \n\nGrace has been released from the hospital into the care of Emma\u2019s parents. She is still very weak and lethargic but she\u2019s recovering as well as she can. I bring Caleb to his grandparents to see her several times a week and it\u2019s just so wonderful to see how happy they are to see each other. I can barely hold in the tears, this has been so difficult for both of them and I love that they have each other. \n\nThere\u2019s been a never ending series of meetings, visits and phone calls with CPS, boards and family lawyers these past 2 weeks which has been\u2026 a lot. There are complications to Caleb being placed with me that I had not considered before and almost resulted in him being placed with his paternal grandparents but ultimately it was decided it was best for Caleb to stay where he was - in his same school and near his sister. \n\nBarring any major complications, I will officially be granted temporary custody early next week and very likely - guardianship this summer. Grace will remain with her grandparents for at least the time being but me taking her once she\u2019s stronger has been suggested. It\u2019s uncertain if or when this could happen but it\u2019s a possibility. It would be best for them to be together.\n\nEmma\u2019s social media is still active, we can see her opening our messages but we do not know where she is or who she is with. I just hope she stays alive. I don\u2019t think I can ever forgive her for this but her children still need her to be okay. \n\nCaleb will turn 8 at the end of this month. He wants to go ice skating! I\u2019ve never gone myself but I\u2019m so excited to make a fool of myself with him. I just want to give him the best birthday I can; he deserves so much. If anyone has any cool ideas, I\u2019d love to hear them.\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending, it\u2019s not an ending at all but I don\u2019t see myself returning here so it\u2019s the best ending I have for you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for how disjointed my thoughts are, there\u2019s just so much in my head these days", "created_utc": 1675339508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ro9mu/update_aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and/", "score": 456, "replies": ["[We're all original here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvmfdw/aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and_turning/)", "WOW! OP I wish all the best for you.  You are an absolute hero.  Caleb is very lucky to have you in his life, and he and Grace will surely be well taken care of and loved with you. Continue making these memories with them, they'll remember them for the rest of their lives.\n\nIce skating is fun! I went for the first time in my 40s and surely made a fool of myself too!!  As far as ideas, just keep listening and hearing Caleb, as you have been.  It sounds like you have been doing everything right, so I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nIf you have the energy to post an update some time later, please do so.  I wish you, Caleb and Grace all the best!!", "Wow. I'm so glad these kids have you and their grandparents in their corner!\n\nFor the birthday, why not a \"cold day\"? So ice skating, ice cream, maybe a trip to a gallery with a silly \"prize\" for spotting the most winter-themed paintings, or some silly ice-themed crafting? You could also try and have Grace there for the ice cream bit, that's unlikely to stress her recovery.", "You are such an amazing person. Nice to see people looking out for others.", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that things have wound up this way. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m so glad that Caleb and Grace have you in their lives. \n\nI really hope Emma is okay, and that she can heal, and can be a part of Caleb and Grace\u2019s world again, in whatever form is best for them.", "Wow, what a wild situation. I\u2019m in tears because I\u2019m so happy Caleb has you. Emma is despicable but you are extraordinary and truly changing a little life that was otherwise left behind. Give that little man a big birthday hug from all of us", "You are such a wonderful person. As he gets older, in a life with such uncertainty, you will be such a bright spot in Caleb\u2019s life.", "It sounds like Emma completely broke down. I\u2019m so glad that Caleb has you. I hope his sister recovers well soon, and that you continue to have the support you need in raising them.", "It IS a happy ending imo. The children are with the people who care about them.", "The world could use more people like you.", "I love the cold day idea! We were going to bake a cake and bring it to have with Grace but ice cream cake can\u2019t be that hard to make\u2026", "The beauty of ice cream cake is if it collapses into a mess of cake and ice cream... Oh well \ud83e\udd37\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude06", "You can also put fairy cakes into ice-cream cones instead of wrappers. Might be easier to transport!", "Wow this took a drastic turn.\n\nFor her to just completely disappear ... WTF.\n\nI understand she is going through tough feelings with a sick kid and another that she can't be around to watch (and it sounds like the kids dad is not around either) but there's no excuse for just disappearing and abandoning your kids.\n\nI'm glad the kids are OK and little Grace is doing well.\n\nMaybe look into hiring a private investigator (expensive but worth it in this case) to track down Emma. For two reasons:\n\n* To make sure she's safe\n* She owes you guys child support", "The original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvmfdw/aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and_turning/", "OP, thank you for this.\n\nI was in tears reading your first post, and I'm in tears now. You are a wonderful human being and I'm so happy these kids are lucky enough to have you in their lives.\n\nThey're going through, and will continue to go through some really tough emotions, but my gosh you are a rock star with a really amazing mindset. I'm so glad you're sharing yourself and your life with these kids. The opportunity you've given them is worth so much.\n\nI don't even know you, but I'm so proud of you and crying the happiest tears for you.", "I feel like we missed a HUGE chunk here. When did she go missing Jesus. This is a wild story and it seems you\u2019re much more maternal than you thought. I applaud you helping this child so much and making sure he has a good home and great role models. He will thank you later in life.", "You are an amazing woman for sure!! You are able to provide a stable loving home for Caleb while he\u2019s deal with all the issues in his family and that\u2019s truly great! As corny and cliche as it sounds, I think your were meant to be these kids\u2019 \u201cguardian angel\u201d!!  I hope Grace is recovering better each day and I hope she\u2019s able to join you with her brother later this year. It sounds like it\u2019s what\u2019s best for both of these young children. I hope Emma is ok out there somewhere too! Sounds to me like she got overwhelmed, feeling guilty for not being able to be there for her son while her daughter was sick, and just had a mental breakdown. You\u2019re doing the right thing for these kids and you have a heart of gold. I wish all of you the best. I hope you\u2019ll update later down the road. Good luck!", "Regarding the ice skating- since you are an adult you're more likely to get seriously hurt in a fall. I recommend using appropriate protective gear like helmets, pads, and wrist guards.\n\nYour doing the best you can.", "I wish the best for you, Caleb and Grace! You\u2019re an amazing person! If you get to raise these two children, I feel like it would be the absolute best thing for all three of you. I hope you all get to live the happiest, healthiest life together!", "Oh\u2026god.\n\nHow deeply sad for all involved. I\u2019m so sorry, for you and especially for Emma\u2019s family. They\u2019re very lucky to have your friendship and support, though I wish they didn\u2019t need it so desperately. \n\nI hope Emma eventually gets the help she needs. For her sake and her children\u2019s. In the meantime, all the best to you and her family, and I hope Caleb\u2019s birthday gives you all some wonderful memories.", "I just have a fun museum game suggestion I used to play with my Grandfather (and still do...)\nWe used to go around museums or art galleries and choose the pieces we'd \"want\" for our \"summer home\". \nAuch, now I type it it sounds silly, but maybe it'll live on haha. You're doing a wonderful job.", "Holy shit, OP. You are AMAZING! Thank you for stepping up and taking a chance with Caleb.", "OP you are an absolute angel.", "I\u2019m so sorry for how the situation turned out but you are a gem of a person and those kiddos are so lucky to have you.", "It sounds like you\u2019re doing an amazing job for both of these children and they\u2019re very lucky you\u2019re in their life.", "I was super confused but then read the original. You\u2019re an absolute badass for this. You took a kid and exposed him to SO MUCH!\n\nI mean he asked to go to museums and make kimchi that he otherwise wouldn\u2019t have even tried until much later in life! As someone who makes kimchi semi regularly I think that\u2019s so so so cool.\n\nYou sound like an amazing human being and I wish you nothing but the best!", "I'm glad the kids are OK and little Grace is doing well.", "OP says this isn't a happy ending, but it is in my mind. It seems like things are looking up for Caleb and Grace, and OP seems like the perfect guardian for them. I wish them all the best.", "Yeah I suspect Emma may never have had the most stable mental health. Having a chronically and severely ill child may have destroyed it completely. Some people just cannot handle a challenge like that, and they don\u2019t *know* that they can\u2019t handle it until they\u2019re already in it. \n\nJust\u2026really sad all around.", "She\u2019s disappeared once before, when Caleb was a toddler. She left him with her parents for about 6 months. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about going out to look for her myself to make sure she\u2019s okay. Trying to track her down for money is a waste of time, to be realistic. I do want to find her though.", "Thank you!", "A parent abandoning their children is never a \u201chappy ending.\u201d OP is just doing their best with a hard, shitty situation. But those kids are going to carry this with them for the rest of their lives, whether or not their mother ever returns.", "Bonus points for hilarity, Caleb is going to *shriek* at the sight of OP all padded up while slowly pulling themselves around on the railing.", "This is absolutely adorable", "Because of Caleb and your interest in pour painting, I think you\u2019d both really enjoy trying some [ice tie-dye](https://sarahmaker.com/how-to-ice-dye/). Make shirts the day/week before to wear on the day or to share with his sister, grandparents, and friends.\n\nOP, you are amazing!", "They're not hard at all! The hardest part is getting the ice cream to a spreadable consistency. Make sure you buy a high quality ice cream to prevent the ice cream from forming ice crystals as it refreezes - the more fat, the better!\n\nEasiest ice cream cake to make would be in a spring form pan, with a layer of crushed Oreos or graham crackers and butter as your base (on top of a round of parchment paper). You can layer in fruit and freeze before adding more ice cream/another layer.\n\nIf you want actual cake, slice your cake round in half and pop it in the freezer. Use a scoop to add ice cream to your cake base, add the top, and freeze again while you let the outer layer of ice cream soften in a bowl. You'll want a stiff paddle/spatula to stir the ice cream as it softens. You don't want it completely melted -- should still stick to your bowl. When you're ready to spread, it's just like frosting -- only you have to work fast! Pop it back in the freezer and get a pitcher of warm water for your offset spatula. It'll be much easier to clean up the edges of the cake with a warm blade.\n\nSource: managed a homemade ice cream shop for 6 years", "Ice cream sandwich cake is super easy!", "You're amazing. The fact that you immediately leaped to making the ice cream is so cool. Pun intended lol It sounds like Caleb is very lucky to have you and the magical childhood you're giving him.", "It isn't supposed to be that hard to make your own no churn ice cream. It just takes waiting time in the freezer.", "My kids love ice cream sandwiches too! We bake the cookies and then dip the whole sandwich in chocolate, Mini chocolate chips, sprinkles, etc it\u2019s a giant mess and so fun", "Frozen hot chocolate! It's just cocoa mix, ice and chocolate milk, blended until smooth. Throw some mini marshmallows and crushed up candy canes or peppermint candies on top, and you've got a fun and easy treat.", "I am not a lawyer or legal expert, but it wouldn't be unheard of for the courts to try and locate her and file for child support on your behalf. I have heard of it happening when a parent needs to take advantage of government assistance. On that note, please look into government assistance for yourself if you end up with the children permanently. \n\nYou are a rockstar for everything you have done for their family! Hugs to you all.", "Let\u2019s go with \u201cone of the less unhappy endings this could have had\u201d.", "It's better than the mom withholding the kids from the adults who actually care for them.", "Ya'll laugh until you're skating your first time and some 5 year old falls down right in front of you and you have to choose whether to run them over or fall down yourself. So, you choose to fall down and catch yourself with your arm and break your scaphoid. I know someone that did that the first time they went skating.\n\nIf you didn't learn how to do activities that fall down a lot as a kid then falls as an adult can be catastrophic.", "omg thank you! This is so perfect! \n\nI\u2019m going to show him when he gets home from school, I can\u2019t wait", "I feel like it would be the absolute best thing for all three of you.", "I mean, they would, or she would... but you can't bleed a rock. Emma doesn't seem to be in a situation to pay child support.", "We did roller skating and my son kept doing that to me.  The third time I went down on my tail bone was bad.  He\u2019d be fine and then to \u201cprove\u201d how terrible he was he\u2019d throw himself down.   And that\u2019s without giant blades on your feet."]}
