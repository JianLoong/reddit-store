It\u2019s also incomplete but enough people asked me for an update that I felt I owed it to you guys. \n\nEmma has disappeared. I have not heard from her since the phone call and she stopped showing up to hospital around the first week of January. \n\nGrace has been released from the hospital into the care of Emma\u2019s parents. She is still very weak and lethargic but she\u2019s recovering as well as she can. I bring Caleb to his grandparents to see her several times a week and it\u2019s just so wonderful to see how happy they are to see each other. I can barely hold in the tears, this has been so difficult for both of them and I love that they have each other. \n\nThere\u2019s been a never ending series of meetings, visits and phone calls with CPS, boards and family lawyers these past 2 weeks which has been\u2026 a lot. There are complications to Caleb being placed with me that I had not considered before and almost resulted in him being placed with his paternal grandparents but ultimately it was decided it was best for Caleb to stay where he was - in his same school and near his sister. \n\nBarring any major complications, I will officially be granted temporary custody early next week and very likely - guardianship this summer. Grace will remain with her grandparents for at least the time being but me taking her once she\u2019s stronger has been suggested. It\u2019s uncertain if or when this could happen but it\u2019s a possibility. It would be best for them to be together.\n\nEmma\u2019s social media is still active, we can see her opening our messages but we do not know where she is or who she is with. I just hope she stays alive. I don\u2019t think I can ever forgive her for this but her children still need her to be okay. \n\nCaleb will turn 8 at the end of this month. He wants to go ice skating! I\u2019ve never gone myself but I\u2019m so excited to make a fool of myself with him. I just want to give him the best birthday I can; he deserves so much. If anyone has any cool ideas, I\u2019d love to hear them.\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending, it\u2019s not an ending at all but I don\u2019t see myself returning here so it\u2019s the best ending I have for you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for how disjointed my thoughts are, there\u2019s just so much in my head these days", "created_utc": 1675339508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ro9mu/update_aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and/", "score": 5256, "replies": ["[We're all original here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvmfdw/aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and_turning/)", "WOW!

The hardest part is getting the ice cream to a spreadable consistency. Make sure you buy a high quality ice cream to prevent the ice cream from forming ice crystals as it refreezes - the more fat, the better!\n\nEasiest ice cream cake to make would be in a spring form pan, with a layer of crushed Oreos or graham crackers and butter as your base (on top of a round of parchment paper). You can layer in fruit and freeze before adding more ice cream/another layer.\n\nIf you want actual cake, slice your cake round in half and pop it in the freezer. Use a scoop to add ice cream to your cake base, add the top, and freeze again while you let the outer layer of ice cream soften in a bowl. You'll want a stiff paddle/spatula to stir the ice cream as it softens. You don't want it completely melted -- should still stick to your bowl. When you're ready to spread, it's just like frosting -- only you have to work fast! Pop it back in the freezer and get a pitcher of warm water for your offset spatula. It'll be much easier to clean up the edges of the cake with a warm blade.\n\nSource: managed a homemade ice cream shop for 6 years", "Ice cream sandwich cake is super easy!", "You're amazing.

Avail yourself of all the resources offered by social services as you navigate guardianship and act as their voice and advocate. They will need all the medical, mental health, and educational support they can get, and don't be afraid to ask for help for yourself or them. Grace may need educational/occupational therapies to catch up to milestones for her age group after being hospitalized for so long. \n\nDepending on where you live, you likely have additional non-profit agencies in your area (outside the scope of governmental services) that can assist you with physical resources like school supplies and clothing and support like group play therapies, etc. (Source: I'm an educational writer/researcher, and my sister is an LCSW/child therapist at a non-profit that provides no-cost services for children with exceptional trauma. We both work closely with organizations in our area to help families find and get resources.) \n\nDon't forget to take care of yourself, too! You've taken on a lot in a short time frame. Take the time to process your emotions, including your anger at Emma, and take advantage of therapy or other mental health services if you are able. Even superheroes need someone to talk to. \n\nHere's to your new beginning. May you, Caleb, and Grace find much healing and happiness ahead.", "This is a happy ending.

You really made sure he wouldn't feel he lost his family.\n\nSounds like his mom felt less-than and threw a fit. But abandoning her kids because of it? That's too much. She will likely be back sooner or later though, and be even more angry against you. And meanwhile you are getting attached to the kids...\n\nMake sure you build a good relationship with the grandparents, so you will have their support.

I don't really have anything else to add.", "I\u2019m speechless. You do such a great job and the kids are so lucky to have you. I don\u2019t think I could ever forgive her too, but maybe think about sending her pictures every once in a while, without saying something. I guess it\u2019s just too much and she broke down. That\u2019s not an excuse for her behavior, but maybe it helps her to see her kids are ok. I wish you all the best for the future and I guess your \u201cno kids plan\u201d didn\u2019t work out, but it sounds like you love those kids dearly and I think you\u2019d miss them badly. Sometimes life just happens to cross your plans. But you sound like a great, loving and caring guardian and there couldn\u2019t be a better place for them. Send you all the love in the world and hope you\u2019ll change your mind and come back to update us \ud83e\udd0d", "I don't know if you'll see this, but I wanted to thank you for taking amazing care of these kids... Caleb will never forget what you're doing for him, and you are saving his life <3 \n\nI didn't get to read the OG post when it came out, and despite what has been going on with the mum, I'm very relieved that they have you. \n\nThank you for being you", "How do you abandon you're sweet little child that relies on you? My youngest was in NICU for a while. Because we have an older school age child, I wasn't able to spend the night. Fianc\u00e9 worked and i had to get older one off to school. When he was at school i spent as much time at the hospital as i could. However, we had a very trusted nurse that I had worked with before. She would call and text with every update and I was able to call her any time during the night. I felt terrible not being there over night but, I knew he was safe.", "Take gloves the ice is cold especially when you fall", "It\u2019s really sad. The kids may not fully understand things right now, but I\u2019m sure when they\u2019re older (if mom never returns) they will wonder what happened to her.", "This ending reminds me of Matilda tbh. Caleb has a guardian who actually cares and is interested in him.", "Yeah, there\u2019s going to be trauma for the kids no matter what.", "Respectfully, as someone who works with children who get dumped by their parents on the regular and have had this happen throughout their childhood, those kids will NOT be better with her as their guardian IF mom continues acting this way. If she can be a consistent presence in their lives forever? Yes! But if she keeps randomly disappearing across the years those kids are looking at an adulthood rife with mental health difficulties, attachment issues, and emotional difficulty in relationships. Children don\u2019t need their biological moms. They need consistency, stability, and a safe harbor. When the parent cannot be that person they create so much emotional turmoil, fear, and anxiety. No child benefits when they begin to believe (understandably) that they must be as good as possible because any moment mom will dump me with someone and barely check in or just disappear for months and make me think I have a new family now. And the moment I start to let loose and get comfortable she shows up and I have to go back and pretend like I\u2019m cool with her so that she won\u2019t ABANDON ME AGAIN. Like please. I\u2019m begging you. I have seen this play out so many times. It is so horrible for the children. Just because you are mom does not mean you are the best fit to care for your kids. It doesn\u2019t mean mom cannot be that person but until she can actually demonstrate she can it is so damaging and absolutely NOT better to defer to her as the guardian.", "She probably felt like a failure of a mother and has given up.", "Yeah\u2026 the mom clearly doesn\u2019t have the means. She seems to already have reached a breaking point. But hey let\u2019s slap child support on there and see how much more it takes until she quits life.", "While I cannot understand how or why something like this happens (I do not have children) I have had moments where I was so overwhelmed and so caught up in the chaos it was difficult to see past it. And that includes being able to do *anything* at all. \n\nMy own mother had a mental breakdown where she disappeared for about that length of time. She had a stillborn, add a sprinkle of postpartum, a side of civil war, a dash of feeling like a failure and having her body continue to function for the child that didn't make it broke her. \n\nDad found her and was able to remind her that she still had children who needed her to get her home. This was back in the day before mental health was talked about -- and something she still has not processed to this day and all her children have suffered because of. \n\nBut my mother had my father and my grandmother for support. They were present to help her heal the best she could so she could be as present for the older kids (I came after). She was able to surpass the breakdown....Emma does not seem to have any of that. \n\nYeah, it's not an excuse but when there is no support system, shit like this happens. I hope Emma is just hiding and didn't perish.", "Kinship caregiver here. One of my kids was abandoned by his mom (no judgement, she did it because she knew she couldn't meet his needs) and the other CPS took away. Once custody is granted, Mom basically loses all legal rights (except the right to keep her name on the birth certificate, you can't adopt without at least trying to get her signature). Generally custody can be granted once she's abandoned a child for 45 days, and it doesn't require mom's rights to be terminated. If she tries to regain custody before then, of course she could get them back. Once custody is granted, she could petition a judge for visitation, but only if she starts paying child support. She cannot initiate regaining custody unless the guardian agrees or has a major change in status that would make her unable to care for the kids. Basically, she'd have to be severely disabled, imprisoned, or suffer a long term hospitalization. Custody is specifically designed to ensure stability for kids.", "I can't speak for all areas but that's not how it works in my state. Once a child is abandoned and DCFS gets involved a case worker will be assigned. Children also receive their own legal representation (a lawyer) as will the mother should she not have her own lawyer. Mom will also have child abandonment charges filed against her which she will have to answer for and possibly serve time for. Stipulations will be set for mom which typically include tox screens, psych evals, parenting classes, etc. She will also need to provide proof of employment and housing (her OWN housing, not crashing at her parent's). They will also take into account that this is not the first time that mom has abandoned her kids, and whether or not the children are better off where they are (with OP) or with mom.\n\nI would be very surprised if mom got anything more than supervised visits, let alone full custody of her children.", "this.  i think people forget what life is like without a good support system.  being a true single mother is tough-tough.  as much as i admire the OP for what she is doing, she is doing a lot of judging of the children\u2019s mother.  it\u2019s easy to do fun novel things with kids and have that frequent upbeat high artsy creative energy\u2026especially when she hasn\u2019t had the daily grind of raising young kids for years alone. on top of pediatric illnesses, failed relationships, & breadwinner job insecurity.  judging & outrage is easy, nuanced empathy is much much harder.", "At least in Ohio, with kinship placements, the parents' rights aren't officially terminated, but once another person is granted custody, it's next to impossible for the parents to get them back unless the guardian agrees. Best they can get is visitation if they pay child support.", "It is absolutely a criminal act.", "It's wonderful they have you.\n\n\nA little advice. The MOMENT you have legal guardianship get Caleb in therapy. Not because he needs it now necessarily. But so that in 3, 6, 10 years when/if he does start to struggle with the trauma of his sister's hospitalization and his mom's abandonment he will not have to also struggle with the idea of therapy. \n\n\nIt's no where near a similar situation, but I genuinely believe that the reason my preteen is so comfortable in therapy is because I took him in young at the first sign of complex trouble. He went at age 5 when he trusted my opinion completely, he was able to go in confident that we all just wanted to be a part of his team, cause he was little, it was fun for him... He wasn't there for long. But then as a hormonal, grunting preteen we ran into issues that required professional help in a bigger way... And therapy was already established deep in his brain as a safe, comfortable place for him, instead of something big and scary trying to invade his privacy.", "Thank you so much for being a wonderful human, OP. The world needs more of you. \ud83d\udc97", "Holy f dude I just wanna give you a big hug. What you\u2019re doing for those kids is remarkable and selfless. I hope things work out for everyone. Thanks for stepping up and being an actual role model that\u2019s is so clearly needed at this time. All the best to you.", "You are amazing. I wish the best for you.", "Ya know I was the mom with an immunocompromised daughter who was constantly in the hospital (I did the math out of her 11.5yrs of life she spent about 6.5 in the hospital). I chose not to have another kid because I didn't want them to feel that I didn't love them as much. I also had my days where I had to avoid social media because it was so hard to not feel jealous and like I was a bad mom because other people's kids were flourishing and living life. I can completely understand where the mom could mentally break, but I could never fathom just ditching my kids. My mom used to do it when she got mad at my dad and when she did leave him she left us kids so that probably plays a part. I'm just glad that the kids are around someone who is giving them a safe, loving environment throughout all of this.", "it's not a happy ending!  it's a happy beginning!", "Probably too late to be read, but\u2026 it looks a lot like she had a massive mental breakdown, and not for the first time. She\u2019s probably mentally ill, and needs professional help. You\u2019re a huge person for acting as you did. Give those kids all the love they deserve", "If she came back, she would probably face charges for child abandonment and essentially neglect. I don't care what this woman is going through as there is no supported excuse for her actions. How dare she do this to not only her children but also her family?! I'm just so disgusted by the self pitying narcissism she is displaying.", "NTA\n\nIt's always interesting to me that the people who don't want kids are sometimes the best with them.", "From here it sounds like Emma is grappling with serious issues.\n\nThe children are better off with you.\n\nNTA", "Damn, you're a good person and I'm happy that you are there for those kids.  It sucks that their mother has a lot of issues and I hope she stays safe and comes to her senses but her kids are the main focus for you now and I wish you all the best.", "Although those kids will always have a missing part of themselves due to their mother\u2019s absence, this IS a happy ending for them. They are so, so lucky to have you. I had a mom like Emma who left me with her parents for two years when I was young and I often wish she would have just left me there and not taken me back. You\u2019re an amazing person. Truly. \n\nI do hope that someday Emma can get it together and reconcile with all of you and especially her kids. But she is missing so much. It\u2019s so sad that she is. Thank goodness those kids have you.", "I made ice cream cake a few times when I was a kid! super easy, we had a cake pan where the bottom comes off of the sides which made it a lot easier. it was fun because we were able to pick our two favorite flavors, instead of just chocolate and vanilla. iirc, it went \n\nfirst tub of ice cream spread in the pan > freeze > crushed up chocolate cookies mixed with fudge or chocolate syrup layer > freeze > second ice cream layer > freeze \n\nthen whipped topping to ice it. I'm sure you could find a super simple recipe online, or something more complicated if that's your thing :) \n\nhave fun, and I hope their mom is okay, even if she can't be in their lives right now", "It sounds like Emma really needs to work through some stuff in therapy and has maybe had really bad post partum depression :(", "Be sure to check out any government assistance! It depends on location, but your social worker will know. Caleb might qualify for medicare and WIC (kinda like food stamps, you get certain groceries for free). Don\u2019t be afraid to use these even if you\u2019re doing alright financially.", ">She\u2019s disappeared once before, when Caleb was a toddler. She left him with her parents for about 6 months.\n\nMake sure the judge in your custody case is aware of this, she needs to have her parental rights stripped away. Her kids are not safe in her care.", "This is not necessary a bad thing if this is something OP chose, and it definitely seems like it.", "OP did say that she stopped coming to the hospital so I feel like it's fairly safe to say she was there from October to January.", "From what I recall this was a thrilling parlour game in the late 1900s lol.", "You're clearly doing your best among several bad situations that you didn't cause or have an obligation  to fix. Emma knows someone is caring for her kids. Like you suspect, it seems like her parents would have told her you're caring for them.  \n\nDo you think both you and her would be agreeable to longer term care of Caleb? It's obviously beneficial for him IMO.", "I'm sorry, but by trying to make them rejoin together you are going to be throwing those kids into a very unfair cycle. Its going to mess them up and hinder their ability to be functional adults. They are far better off in a stable home where they are not abandoned. Being with their \"mom\" is not the best for them. My SIL would often just abandon her kids.. they both have severe issue now, from both the abandonment and whom she abandoned them with.", "OP while abandonment is never a good thing and not knowing how Emma is also not a good thing, you are. Those kids are SO lucky to have you, the love and care you have, and to not be put in the system but instead be with someone that they know who is providing and caring for them. Life is complicated, this is complicated, but you keep being you bc you are such a blessing in a situation that could be so much worse. If there any petting zoos or mini farms or any outdoor activities that could be a really special birthday. Also not sure what the weather is like but ice-skating and maybe a picnic with all the foods he\u2019s loved making with you? Or movies and a pillow fort for movies at night. I think as well, a gift that is very sentimental could be a great thing, as he seems like a gentle kid. When I was a child a relative I loved bought me Grimm\u2019s Fairytales - the real stories, probably a bit morbid for a child but I loved older narratives, and she wrote a message in the cover. I still have that book and it was one of my most prized possessions as kid, I loved that fabric bound book with its ribbon bookmark and gold painted edges. That was the last time I saw her, but I still held on to that book and all the love it represented.", "I just hope that you are making sure Caleb doesn't think he is the reason his mom went AWOL. Good for you!"]}
