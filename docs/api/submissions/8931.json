It\u2019s also incomplete but enough people asked me for an update that I felt I owed it to you guys. \n\nEmma has disappeared. I have not heard from her since the phone call and she stopped showing up to hospital around the first week of January. \n\nGrace has been released from the hospital into the care of Emma\u2019s parents. She is still very weak and lethargic but she\u2019s recovering as well as she can. I bring Caleb to his grandparents to see her several times a week and it\u2019s just so wonderful to see how happy they are to see each other. I can barely hold in the tears, this has been so difficult for both of them and I love that they have each other. \n\nThere\u2019s been a never ending series of meetings, visits and phone calls with CPS, boards and family lawyers these past 2 weeks which has been\u2026 a lot. There are complications to Caleb being placed with me that I had not considered before and almost resulted in him being placed with his paternal grandparents but ultimately it was decided it was best for Caleb to stay where he was - in his same school and near his sister. \n\nBarring any major complications, I will officially be granted temporary custody early next week and very likely - guardianship this summer. Grace will remain with her grandparents for at least the time being but me taking her once she\u2019s stronger has been suggested. It\u2019s uncertain if or when this could happen but it\u2019s a possibility. It would be best for them to be together.\n\nEmma\u2019s social media is still active, we can see her opening our messages but we do not know where she is or who she is with. I just hope she stays alive. I don\u2019t think I can ever forgive her for this but her children still need her to be okay. \n\nCaleb will turn 8 at the end of this month. He wants to go ice skating! I\u2019ve never gone myself but I\u2019m so excited to make a fool of myself with him. I just want to give him the best birthday I can; he deserves so much. If anyone has any cool ideas, I\u2019d love to hear them.\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending, it\u2019s not an ending at all but I don\u2019t see myself returning here so it\u2019s the best ending I have for you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for how disjointed my thoughts are, there\u2019s just so much in my head these days", "created_utc": 1675339508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ro9mu/update_aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and/", "score": 2243, "replies": ["[We're all original here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvmfdw/aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and_turning/)", "WOW!

The hardest part is getting the ice cream to a spreadable consistency. Make sure you buy a high quality ice cream to prevent the ice cream from forming ice crystals as it refreezes - the more fat, the better!\n\nEasiest ice cream cake to make would be in a spring form pan, with a layer of crushed Oreos or graham crackers and butter as your base (on top of a round of parchment paper). You can layer in fruit and freeze before adding more ice cream/another layer.\n\nIf you want actual cake, slice your cake round in half and pop it in the freezer. Use a scoop to add ice cream to your cake base, add the top, and freeze again while you let the outer layer of ice cream soften in a bowl. You'll want a stiff paddle/spatula to stir the ice cream as it softens. You don't want it completely melted -- should still stick to your bowl. When you're ready to spread, it's just like frosting -- only you have to work fast! Pop it back in the freezer and get a pitcher of warm water for your offset spatula. It'll be much easier to clean up the edges of the cake with a warm blade.\n\nSource: managed a homemade ice cream shop for 6 years", "Ice cream sandwich cake is super easy!", "You're amazing.

Avail yourself of all the resources offered by social services as you navigate guardianship and act as their voice and advocate. They will need all the medical, mental health, and educational support they can get, and don't be afraid to ask for help for yourself or them. Grace may need educational/occupational therapies to catch up to milestones for her age group after being hospitalized for so long. \n\nDepending on where you live, you likely have additional non-profit agencies in your area (outside the scope of governmental services) that can assist you with physical resources like school supplies and clothing and support like group play therapies, etc. (Source: I'm an educational writer/researcher, and my sister is an LCSW/child therapist at a non-profit that provides no-cost services for children with exceptional trauma. We both work closely with organizations in our area to help families find and get resources.) \n\nDon't forget to take care of yourself, too! You've taken on a lot in a short time frame. Take the time to process your emotions, including your anger at Emma, and take advantage of therapy or other mental health services if you are able. Even superheroes need someone to talk to. \n\nHere's to your new beginning. May you, Caleb, and Grace find much healing and happiness ahead.", "This is a happy ending.

You really made sure he wouldn't feel he lost his family.\n\nSounds like his mom felt less-than and threw a fit. But abandoning her kids because of it? That's too much. She will likely be back sooner or later though, and be even more angry against you. And meanwhile you are getting attached to the kids...\n\nMake sure you build a good relationship with the grandparents, so you will have their support.

Your friend is a major A to both her children, but you are not only NTA, you are a savior! Literally!
