It\u2019s also incomplete but enough people asked me for an update that I felt I owed it to you guys. \n\nEmma has disappeared. I have not heard from her since the phone call and she stopped showing up to hospital around the first week of January. \n\nGrace has been released from the hospital into the care of Emma\u2019s parents. She is still very weak and lethargic but she\u2019s recovering as well as she can. I bring Caleb to his grandparents to see her several times a week and it\u2019s just so wonderful to see how happy they are to see each other. I can barely hold in the tears, this has been so difficult for both of them and I love that they have each other. \n\nThere\u2019s been a never ending series of meetings, visits and phone calls with CPS, boards and family lawyers these past 2 weeks which has been\u2026 a lot. There are complications to Caleb being placed with me that I had not considered before and almost resulted in him being placed with his paternal grandparents but ultimately it was decided it was best for Caleb to stay where he was - in his same school and near his sister. \n\nBarring any major complications, I will officially be granted temporary custody early next week and very likely - guardianship this summer. Grace will remain with her grandparents for at least the time being but me taking her once she\u2019s stronger has been suggested. It\u2019s uncertain if or when this could happen but it\u2019s a possibility. It would be best for them to be together.\n\nEmma\u2019s social media is still active, we can see her opening our messages but we do not know where she is or who she is with. I just hope she stays alive. I don\u2019t think I can ever forgive her for this but her children still need her to be okay. \n\nCaleb will turn 8 at the end of this month. He wants to go ice skating! I\u2019ve never gone myself but I\u2019m so excited to make a fool of myself with him. I just want to give him the best birthday I can; he deserves so much. If anyone has any cool ideas, I\u2019d love to hear them.\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending, it\u2019s not an ending at all but I don\u2019t see myself returning here so it\u2019s the best ending I have for you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for how disjointed my thoughts are, there\u2019s just so much in my head these days", "created_utc": 1675339508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ro9mu/update_aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and/", "score": 42, "replies": ["[We're all original here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvmfdw/aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and_turning/)", "WOW! OP I wish all the best for you.  You are an absolute hero.  Caleb is very lucky to have you in his life, and he and Grace will surely be well taken care of and loved with you. Continue making these memories with them, they'll remember them for the rest of their lives.\n\nIce skating is fun! I went for the first time in my 40s and surely made a fool of myself too!!  As far as ideas, just keep listening and hearing Caleb, as you have been.  It sounds like you have been doing everything right, so I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nIf you have the energy to post an update some time later, please do so.  I wish you, Caleb and Grace all the best!!", "Wow. I'm so glad these kids have you and their grandparents in their corner!\n\nFor the birthday, why not a \"cold day\"? So ice skating, ice cream, maybe a trip to a gallery with a silly \"prize\" for spotting the most winter-themed paintings, or some silly ice-themed crafting? You could also try and have Grace there for the ice cream bit, that's unlikely to stress her recovery.", "You are such an amazing person. Nice to see people looking out for others.", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that things have wound up this way. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m so glad that Caleb and Grace have you in their lives. \n\nI really hope Emma is okay, and that she can heal, and can be a part of Caleb and Grace\u2019s world again, in whatever form is best for them.", "Wow, what a wild situation. I\u2019m in tears because I\u2019m so happy Caleb has you. Emma is despicable but you are extraordinary and truly changing a little life that was otherwise left behind. Give that little man a big birthday hug from all of us", "You are such a wonderful person. As he gets older, in a life with such uncertainty, you will be such a bright spot in Caleb\u2019s life.", "It sounds like Emma completely broke down. I\u2019m so glad that Caleb has you. I hope his sister recovers well soon, and that you continue to have the support you need in raising them.", "It IS a happy ending imo. The children are with the people who care about them.", "The world could use more people like you.", "I love the cold day idea! We were going to bake a cake and bring it to have with Grace but ice cream cake can\u2019t be that hard to make\u2026", "The beauty of ice cream cake is if it collapses into a mess of cake and ice cream... Oh well \ud83e\udd37\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude06", "You can also put fairy cakes into ice-cream cones instead of wrappers. Might be easier to transport!"]}
