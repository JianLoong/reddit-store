You don't owe that kid anything. If the kid needs something to do, future-sil can buy him a Switch or, being a kid and all, he can go play outside. \n\nWow, such entitlement.

It wouldn\u2019t even be a discussion.", "Agreed NTA\n\nThe groom's family are waving some major red flags.", "Honestly, you have the best response out of anyone. That is all.", "She just kind of dismissed it as that\u2019s how they are. I\u2019ve only met them both a few times each but Sandy insisted on helping me get ready and plays the victim over this.", "You obviously missed the part where OP states that she didn\u2019t know the password, told the entitled mfs as much and when she caught the sister in law trying to turn it on, she repeated herself to no avail. That\u2019s when she decided to unplug it and put it in her bedroom. \nTry reading the post again :)\n\nNTA OP. Talk to your sister and bil immediately", "PS1s didn't require an entire account to be made on the system so that a kid couldn't overwrite someone's game. There wasn't internal saves, period; if you wanted to protect your saved game, you just popped the memory card. PS5s are very different. \n\nAlso, you didn't read the post: OP repeatedly said she *didn't have the device password*.", "It's embarrassing really, like the kid was literally screaming over being told no, the mother should've corrected this instead of playing along with it. Now because of her own poor reaction, she's taught the kid that it's okay to get angry when other people don't want to share their things, and that he shouldn't take no for an answer.\n\nYou don't reward bad behaviour, that's just basic parenting, she needs to learn this asap before it gets even worse.", "I\u2019m being petty, but I\u2019d set up a separate room with a tv with a live feed to the ceremony and attach a ps5 to it. All those that don\u2019t want to come can go to this room with the kid and fight over the tv together. I\u2019d be even more petty by expecting them to answer questions about the event, such as what a particular guest was wearing before letting them join the reception. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to act like a child and throw your toys, you gonna get time out.", "And is she fine with the groom\u2018s side blackmailing you to stay home otherwise they won\u2018t come and upset her fianc\u00e9? \n\nMaybe she suspects that they\u2018re not serious with their threats but it\u2018s concerning.", "Are you still going to the wedding?", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I think the bride probably has other things on her mind. But I think you're right. I think they are empty threats.", "OP has no idea how to create a guest account on a PlayStation she *doesn't use*, so it's really weird for you to insist that she could just do that. Especially when she was setting up a party at the time!\n\nETA: For that matter, she may not have any idea how guest-appropriate the games on the system are.", "I don't know why everyone else is angry, but I admit my back is up a little at you saying she made too big a deal about this. I wouldn't want my spouse to let a 6yo touch my expensive electronics without my permission. OP did right by her spouse and kids.\n\nMoreover, small children are very \"out of sight, out of mind\" when it comes to stuff like this. It makes perfect sense to me to take the PS5 out of sight rather than let the 6yo feel taunted by it.", "you're being downvoted because you told OP she \"made too big a deal out of the PlayStation\" when OP was not the one who made it a big deal. \"No, sorry, i don't know how it works\" is not making a big deal. \"let my child play your expensive game without the security of an adult who understands it around or i won't come to your sister's wedding\" is making a big deal.", "I said it was fine that she didn't want them to use it. What did I say that offends you so? I wasn't insisting on anything. I was responding to your incorrect comment about saves.\n\nAlso, you're assuming OP is dumb which isn't right.", "[deleted]", "I'm not assuming she's dumb, I'm reading her clearly when she says she *doesn't use the PlayStation*. If you don't use a device, it's not easy or fast to set up a guest account while you're trying to set out appetizers. \n\nHeck, I use our Nintendo Switch regularly and still needed a good ten minutes to set up a guest account. Type in the name, pick a picture, etc. It's not the effortless task you're (repeatedly) making it out to be. \n\nWhy are *you* so pressed about this? I'm pressed because a PS5 costs $500 and you're scolding a woman for putting it safely in another room when a random 6yo she doesn't know (I.e., not your son who you let play PS4 because you knew him) was demanding to play with it.", "OR removing it from the room made it not get broken. How are you struggling so much to see that? \n\n>> Moms are busy people too. \n\nAnd yet you repeatedly forget that OP, who is a mom, *had a party she was busy with* because you want her to drop everything and set up a guest account on a device she doesn't use. Or summon pencil and paper from her arse. Or otherwise entertain someone else's child (somehow! some way!) while she's trying to get food laid out for guests. That's strange to me and feels oddly defensive on your part.\n\nETA: Friendo, leaving a comment demanding to know whether I have children, then deleting that comment, then leaving a flounce comment in my mentions, then blocking me doesn't make me rethink my \"oddly defensive\" diagnosis.  Good luck with things.", "Wow. I'll just leave now because I feel I'm being very reasonable but I feel no matter what I say since I didn't say exactly what you feel i must be wrong in some way. I guess none of us should care about how others feel."]}
