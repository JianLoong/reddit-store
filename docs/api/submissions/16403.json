I don\u2019t think there is really any good advice here, maybe the best I can offer is talk to your sister privately. Even tho it\u2019s not your fault and you did nothing wrong in any way I\u2019m sure she\u2019s on edge with her wedding coming up so I would just tell her your sorry for the situation and you want to do what she feels is best for her wedding.
