Hope you the best", "NTA lots of people use laughter and humor as a way to cope and deal. There is no one way to grieve, and people need to understand that!", "NTA.", "You just put a little \"fun\" in \"funeral!!\" Nta!!", "NTA\n\nSorry for your loss.\n\nMy mom passed from cancer when I was 16. The thing that helped me the most during her funeral was humor. \n\nMy uncle and I played what we called \"funeral bullshit\" where anytime someone offered the same empty sentiments 3 times we would find each other and whisper \"bullshit\".\n\nHumor was how I coped. If it works for you do it. Grieve how you grieve, no one should dictate how you live.  It will be 16 years since she's gone now and I still do it. Last year someone asked me if I had plans with Mom for mother's day that evening, I told them no because the cemetery closed at 6. I still laugh thinking about their shocked face and how my Mom would have knocked my block off.", "YTA just because you cope differently doesn\u2019t mean you disrespect it dead I always find it\u2019s funny how the \u201cI use humor to cope\u201d crowd would absolutely hate somebody ELSE to say that to them but it\u2019s fine when they do it", "NTA sometimes I also tell a funny joke or hilarious story from my childhood and everyone looks at me all concerned instead of laugh.

I am so sorry you lost your mom \u2764\ufe0f", "If it makes you feel better, I'm a funeral director and honestly 90% of families I serve make jokes like this. Humor is a way our society copes with grief. Of course, everyone grieves differently so I don't think your aunt is TA either for being upset with the joke, but don't feel like you did anything wrong or crossed any lines. I've heard every type of black humor joke out there when talking with families about their loved ones. If it helps you get through this time, that's what matters. NTA to NAH.\n\nSorry for your loss", "Gallows humor is a thing. Your joke made me smile but it obviously didn\u2019t land with your family. If your aunt is still bringing it up, apologize and tell her you\u2019d like to move past it.\n\nNAH, and my sympathies to you and your family.", "Find a new circle. Life will be a lot more enjoyable. At some point humor has always been a part of a healthy coping process", "Is your circle just spinning around in place?", "Where does the post say this an Irish, or a wake?", "Definitely have not been to one then lol not all living are scared to make light of heavy situations so don\u2019t act like the only way to show respect is to be somber and serious.", "NTA. I laughed when I was told by the Coroner\u2019s office  that my dad\u2019s death was being listed as \u201caccidental.\u201d My dad smoked and drank most of his life, he had cancer and COPD. He died when he fell down a set of stairs and broke his leg, and had a heart attack because of the trauma. I can\u2019t explain why I thought it was funny, but I did\u2026I can almost guarantee that my family would not have agreed.", "NTA\n\nI based this on the fact that I laughed. I may just be a terrible person and YTA after all, but I doubt it.", "You are not the asshole - however I am not the one to judge.

My uncle said, Damn Jimmy couldn\u2019t wait to get to hell!", "NTA Sometimes you just have to surface for a minute, or drown. Aunt really should have understood that. You were fine. Very sorry for your loss, you and all your family.", "NTA\n\nI have said absolutely bone headed things at funerals.\n\nPeople when at funerals feel all sorts of emotions. But funerals are tense and weird and unusual. It can cause people to say weird or embarrassing things under stress.", "NAH grief is weird and awful. When my grandma passed (we had known it would happen for a while) my mom and her sisters were cracking up during the funeral planning. Making jokes is a way to cope and it's perfectly fine. However, I can see how the joking may hurt other people who are also grieving. I still don't think you're in the wrong for it but I don't think that one landed well. If it makes you feel any better, I would have laughed with you \ud83d\ude05", "My mom died last week too. Cracking jokes is about the only thing holding me together.
