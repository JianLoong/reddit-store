Ann and her mother and father, who I will call Pothead and Sleazeball, or PH and SB.,  have a fractious relationship, with PH kicking Ann and Sam out when Sam was  5. They had no place to go, Ann was friends with Joe at the time so she called Joe. Joe asked me to help and I did. Paid for a place to stay, food, a car to drive etc. The reason they were kicked out was that Ann, refused to give PH her paycheck to buy weed. I couldnt take them in at the time as my other son had the only other room in my home.  Fast forward Feb '21 Joe and Ann fell in love and got married and they had a daughter Sara. Jump to Sept '23, the place Joe and Ann was renting had to replace the entire floor so they moved in with PH and SB. One frigid afternoon in Dec '23, I get a call from Ann who was in tears, PH had kicked them out, again. Ann had walked over a half mile, barefoot, in 32 degree weather, carying Sara, with Sam to a gas station to call Joe and I.\nThe reason this time, was Joe had moved some boxes. Empty boxes. To make a path to walk from the bed room to the bathroom. PH is a major hoarder, which I did not know. I helped get them, and I had room so they all live with me now. Ann and PH stopped contact until 2 days ago, PH had called Ann and said she was sorry, she really had changed, blah, blah....Ann allowed PH to come pick up Ann, Sara and Sam to go to McDs and visit. I couldnt control my anger, I went out to the car and in no uncertain terms told PH that if she ever made Ann cry like she did, or put my grandbabies in danger in any way, there would be hell to pay, and I would make sure she never saw any of them again. So now PH sent me this long diatribe text saying I had no businees saying what I did, and Ann was her daughter and she could see her whenever she wanted and mind my own business. My response was that like it or not, this was my business now. Yet, I am having second thoughts, should I have just let it go??", "created_utc": 1689460390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150p58c/aitah_for_telling_my_daughter_in_laws_mother_that/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good on you for giving them a place to stay to tide them over.", "NTA  Ann is part of your family now too and she came to you for help. PH put both Ann and the kids in physical danger. I can\u2019t imagine the kids were properly clothed for a walk in freezing temps if Ann couldn\u2019t even get shoes on. You made it clear to PH than her behavior is unacceptable, which Ann doesn\u2019t seem capable of doing on her own yet. Encourage her to get some counseling and to limit contact, preferably no contact. She may be used to this abuse but she has kids now that she has to protect. Being in PHs house is not safe.", "Nta. But perhaps recommending some counseling to Ann might be more productive so she can gain the emptional strength to stand up to PH and SB ...or cut them out of her life altogether for the sake of herself and those kids.

Her mother made Ann and her child homeless for not giving her drug money.  And yet, the second her mum says she has changed, Ann immediately exposes her children to her instead of cautiously rebuilding the relationship first to see if she has actually changed. I hope for Ann's sake she has changed but it is more likely she wants to leech off her again. You charging in there like that has just given her an opening to build a wedge between you and Ann. I understand your anger and impulse but I don't think what you did was the smartest way to handle this. You have zero leverage over this woman. Both she and you know it, and you just look foolish threatening her. It is also possible Ann resents your intererance rather than appreciate it. I would talk to Ann and apologise if you made her feel uncomfortable. Let her know you are in her corner, and she deserves love and happiness.", "NTA.  I'm guess that Ann hasn't had anyone stand up for her before.  It's wonderful that she and her kids have you in her corner.", "NTA, but apparently all this happened in the future?
