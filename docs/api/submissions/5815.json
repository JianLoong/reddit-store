She went into repair for about 10 months at this point. But over the remaining highschool and the first half of summer I was severely depressed. To the point I was barely human.  The second half I had friends to help me get out of this hole. \n\nAs I slowly became more mentally stable I realized my parents held a lot above my head in order for me to do things for them. Including this jeep. After more time working through things did I realize I had most of my mental decline on this jeep, I realized every time it was taken away, I would get hurt. And I had stopped loving it. After the last time my dad threaten to sell it I just said okay.\n\nHe kept the jeep because he needed to fix it. There were a few things wrong main death wobble and some seals. I had to help because idk. Well I just didn't. Now fast forward to December I have no clue on the status of how functional the jeep is but dad is driving it. I was told to clean it to pay back my college fees. Whatever. On my break my dad and mom said they had a late Christmas present. They were giving me my jeep back! They asked how it feels to have her back. I just said Nah. \n\nThey asked what I meant and I replied that I didn't want it. Now they are scrambling to come up with a deal with me because the other reason my dad didn't sell it was because he wanted it to pass down to me since it's a manual and I can drive manual. My sister can't drive manual. My parents said they'll give me till tomorrow to think about it to give themselves time to come up with something for me to take back the jeep. I'm still saying no, an I'm happy about it, I told my sister about it and how I'm laughing to myself at them scrambling. She said that I was an asshole for doing this to them. That they spent about 2,500 on repairs and I told them to just sell it.\n\nAfter that my mom came out to tell me to keep my head up and straight (which means to think things over and not to to feel bad) I nodded and went back to cleaning as she went to work.\n\nMaybe I am maybe I'm not, if I am I'll own it if not eh not a big deal.

Sure it sucked during winter time when I had a 30 minute walk & a few times someone tried to abduct me in broad daylight but other than that it was okay.  On the bright side I probably saved over $2 or 3 grand by not having one cause my school constantly raised parking fees and did shady stuff like abruptly changing lots & towing cars.", "NTA youre just tired.
