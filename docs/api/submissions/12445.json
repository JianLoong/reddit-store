I'm obviously not of your culture so idk if this would work for you but you could move away for a year(or more or less). Force her take back the parenting role for a while then move back. The moving out and moving back gives you the opportunity to change the boundaries of your familial relationships upon moving back in. Only move back in when you've laid clear boundaries on how things will work now. This current dynamic is not working for you and it's entirely valid for you to want it to change. \n\nJust try to give her a few months warning that you intend to move out. That'll give her time to get her shit together(new job, moving, etc). I'm sure she can find another job she's miserable at closer to her children. \n\nIf moving out is not an option at all, just tell her she needs to move back because you want to get a full time job and start your life in general(if she was a young parent, you can use that to your advantage: you started your family at X age, I'd like to start trying to find one too). Again, I'm sure she can find another job nearby that makes her just as miserable as the one she's at now.\n\nEdit: and that \"she helps financially\", she should be taking care of all the finances when it comes to the children(food, housing, babysitters, etc).", "Don\u2019t think about it as confronting her. She needs to support her children first and you need to be able to build your own financial security. You are providing so much by being their caretaker, she needs to provide the financial support at the very least. Write down what you want to tell her and practice it. Focus on your needs and how much you\u2019re already doing as the caretaker. She needs to step up with the financial support for her children before anyone else in her family. Good luck.", "Child protective services.", "May I ask what cps is?", "I\u2019ll definitely keep that in mind.

Please start looking for jobs closer to home because your kids need you here more than they need you sending money.

The main reason I can\u2019t easily leave is because I don\u2019t want them to suffer and have a hard time. I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s CPS in my country, but I\u2019ll never consider it. \n\nAnd sending my siblings to my mom would be difficult, as she is in another country (UAE).", "The way you just put my thoughts into words \ud83d\ude2d Thank you!", "It's five years of your life. It sucks that you have to be the mom. If there are any other good options like an aunt or cousin then try to arrange for them to be there instead of with you. \n\nBut what I suggest is you talk to your siblings and your mom. Tell your siblings you need more help. Have the 16 year old get a job. Have the 13 year old do more chores around the house so you have more free time. \n \nTell your mom her letters make your feel more pressured and you would just like her to stop telling you how responsible you are.\n\nPeople on here often don't understand that there are no good options.  It sucks you are in this situation but your siblings are innocent. You can't abandon them. If you do and sometime happens you'll feel terrible forever. \n\nEdited because my dog hit the post button.", "CPS and its equivalents around the world don\u2019t immediately remove minors from their homes unless their lives are in immediate danger. The process usually starts with a phone call and home visit where the agent interviews everyone involved, and oftentimes that\u2019s enough to jolt parents/caregivers into realizing they\u2019re screwing up.", "I\u2019ll definitely communicate my needs more. Guess I\u2019m not as bad and selfish as I painted myself out to be after reading all the comments. Thank you."]}
