I'm obviously not of your culture so idk if this would work for you but you could move away for a year(or more or less). Force her take back the parenting role for a while then move back.

Again, I'm sure she can find another job nearby that makes her just as miserable as the one she's at now.\n\nEdit: and that \"she helps financially\", she should be taking care of all the finances when it comes to the children(food, housing, babysitters, etc).", "Don\u2019t think about it as confronting her.

Those people basically lived off the OFWs income and never felt the urge to get their own job. \n\nHow about when she retires? Is she planning to make you and your siblings her retirement plan?
