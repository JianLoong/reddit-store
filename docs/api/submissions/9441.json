She said it\u2019s important for her that I\u2019m there for support and comfort and that she would feel vulnerable and abandoned and alone if I weren\u2019t. \n\nNow, I desperately want my wife to be as comfortable as she possibly could and I want to be there for her every step of the way but the truth is, I honestly don\u2019t know if I would be able to help her much. I fear I would collapse and the doctors would have to deal with me instead of her and that just isn\u2019t rational. I get very sick at the sight of blood, I know, it\u2019s probably stupid but I can\u2019t help it, I\u2019ve fainted a dozen times because of this and I just know I would be more of a hindrance to her than help. \n\nOne of our friends gave up a video recording of his wife giving birth and I couldn\u2019t watch it. I understand, childbirth is a very natural, amazing and wonderful event but what I saw, little as it was, on that video still haunts me.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m pretty ashamed of this because it makes me feel weak and I hate that I can\u2019t be there for my wife. I understand that she has to actually go through all of that not just see it, but my bottom line is that I\u2019m convinced I won\u2019t be able to stay and support her - I\u2019ll either have to leave the room or just pass out next to her. \n\nShe got very upset when I told her all that and we\u2019ve barely spoken since.

He never saw what was happening under the sheet.\n\nI was alone when I had our second child because we had no one to help with our oldest. It was the worst birthing experience of my life for numerous reasons, it still haunts me to this day.\n\nEdit : Yes, there was a sheet. Yes, im in the US. Not all hospitals are the same. My husband sat facing me. He saw no blood, no goo, nothing gory or gross, unless you count the sticky child I pushed out.", "Info: can you just stand by her head and not look? If you truly faint that would definitely cause a commotion but her doing alone is sad too. This is tough. Edit to add: you\u2019ll definitely endure a lot of bodily functions & injuries raising children so maybe you should seek help for this phobia?", "YTA but I want to give you words of encouragement here instead of shame. \n\nDon\u2019t feed into the toxic \u201cman up\u201d or \u201cdeal with it\u201d thoughts some of these comments are feeding you. Tough love works, but not here. Your phobia, reactions, and feelings are valid.\n\nThis is all about her, and to show that love for her, overcoming your fears will mean a lot to her. ~~She will be just as scared as you are in there.~~ Edit: another redditor mentioned a good point that she will be more scared than you will be. That is true, still doesn't undermine your feelings though <3\n\nDoctors probably go through families fainting all the time. They\u2019re not going to suddenly stop what they\u2019re doing and help you since, again, this is about her. If you do faint, they will have another nurse take care of you.", "You can stand by her head and hold her hand. You don't need to see much of anything if you don't want to. \n\n\n\nHonestly- yta for not telling her you would not be at her side before getting her pregnant. Compared to giving birth, being the support is the easy part.", "INFO...couldn't you just look at her face, comb her hair and concentrate on her? You need to think outside the box here a bit.", "You don\u2019t have to look down there. Stand next to her and hold her hand and be supportive. It took both of yous to get pregnant so to leave her alone when she is going through the hardest part and most painful is disgusting. And if you did pass out and you think they would look after you and leave her \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 they would leave you on the floor. Your not priority in the delivery room. Help your wife.", "Just so you know, they'll basically ignore you, because you're not really relevant to what's going on. Been happening for decades.\n\nand YTA you don't have to see it.

She will. \n\n> I honestly don\u2019t know if I would be able to help her much. I fear I would collapse and the doctors would have to deal with me instead of her\n\nThey are used to this, they will provide accordingly. They will still get their job done. It's fine, I promise. \n\n> I get very sick at the sight of blood\n\nStay near the top of the bed. You don't have to look. Many ways to be there to support her, you do NOT have to watch the baby come out, or any of the \"downstairs\" business. You just *being* there will be such a comfort. \n\nI have no judgment, but my suggestion is you be there for her. Hold her hand, give her ice chips, don't look down lol, and have a chair accessible if you feel faint. (When helping coach a birth I almost passed out. A nurse brought me a chair and kept one eye on me, every other doctor and nurse kept to the birth itself. They even assured me after it wasn't any kind of problem, they encounter this stuff a lot.)", "YTA. If my husband refused to be in there with me, he would quickly be my ex husband.", "The worst that could happen to you is you faint. \n\nThe worst that could happen to your wife is she dies. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. I have something similar. I have a massive needle phobia and I tend to pass out when I get my blood taken. Well guess what I've had 3 kids. One gave me gestational diabetes and then I found out I have a genetic disorder which required a shot every day because I couldn't take the pill form while pregnant. And let me tell you, my husband does not have the best bedside manner. \n\nBut I got through it. I learned coping mechanisms to get me through each interaction easier. So the next time I have to give blood, I still freak out and it takes time for me to calm myself down, but I am capable of holding my own in these situations. You're not just having a child, you're entering a new stage of growth for yourself. This might be one of those things for you which would help you later down the road. What happens if you're home alone with the child and they step on glass and need stitches? What if they cut themselves on something? Are you going to be effective in these moments or are you going to let your fear take over? \n\nIt's certainly not easy. And it takes, at least for me, a lot of brain power to talk myself through these things. But you will see the results. \n\nAs for being in the delivery room, you should be there. My first pregnancy, I was in labor for almost 48 hours. I couldn't sleep at all and the only comfort I got was when my husband put pressure on my back. I couldn't imagine him not being there for me in my time of need.", "You could close your eyes and hold her hand, or look at the ceiling perhaps?", "YTA.\n\nGiving birth is a totally natural thing, but your wife is going through it for the first time ever and is probably terrified. You have no idea how it's going to feel, no idea what the pain is going to feel like, and even if things go absolutely perfectly, it's still incredibly scary.\n\nSome women don't want their partners in the room with them, and if this was the case with your wife then I would change my answer. But she clearly does want you there and needs your support, and you're not willing to provide it because you're putting your own comfort and welfare first. She has carried this baby, dealt with all the horrific pregnancy symptoms, the changes it has caused to her body, the stress and the anxiety. The least you could do as the man who provided the two pumps and a squirt it takes to create the baby, is be there for her, to reassure her and hold her hand if she needs you.\n\nYou can be at a birth without seeing much at all, and if you let the doctors and midwives know that you're squeamish then they can prepare for that eventuality. If you did happen to hit the deck during the birth, they will always prioritise the welfare of your wife and child - they'll just check you're not injured and allow you to come round.\n\nIf you don't go, this is likely to stick with your wife for a long time. You risk potentially ruining what is meant to be a magical moment where you welcome your child into the world, and you won't get that back.\n\nYou could try watching birth videos or at least some of the process, and desensitising yourself to it. There are some good programs (One Born Every Minute, etc) that show what it is like to give birth without actually showing the more detailed parts (it is on television, so they can't show much at all).\n\nAs someone who has given birth, I get that it isn't exactly a pretty thing for the most part. But it is amazing, and it is important that you provide your wife with the support she needs. I guarantee you she's far more anxious than you are about giving birth.", "YTA. As scary as this is for you, it's scarier for your wife. You don't have to look at the blood. You still have a month - that's long enough for you to get a therapist and start some exposure therapy ASAP. I strongly recommend this. You may never like the sight of blood, but it is possible to reach the point where you no longer pass out.", "YTA. Your wife giving birth is not about what makes you comfortable. Do you think this is going to be a comfortable experience for her?", "YTA. Watching a homemade video of your friends wife\u2019s delivery is not the same (I really hope your friend had permission to share that video btw). You never should have brought this up to your wife. She expressed what she needs and you made it about you. The only correct response would have been along the lines of \u201cOf course! I\u2019ll do everything in my power to be as supportive as possible for you!\u201d \n>\nYou have no idea how nervous your wife is right now. She needs you to step up your game. You\u2019ve had 35 weeks to plan for this. The final stretch was the wrong time to bring this up.", "YTA for not willing to see any other solutions. Talk to the doctor now about how you wish not to see anything and they will respect that. Stand/sit by your wife\u2019s head and support her through delivering your child.", "I understand what you are saying, i do, i have a massive needle phobia and tend to pass out at the sight of them.  However, i also have 5 kids. Vaccinations, stitches, blood draws, broken arm, these are all things that have happened over the decades. Each time i absolutely had to find a way to suck it up to be there for them. I couldn't be scared of the needle when my 3 year old had to get blood drawn. When they thought my one kid had meningitis and she was in the hospital on an i.v. and such guess who could not be afraid of needles at that moment. You guessed it. Me. \n\nYou have to find a way to make this work. You don't have to be the one to catch the baby and deliver the afterbirth. There will be a doctor/midwife for that.  You can sit up by her head, face her if need be and be supportive.  Let the nurses handle the other stuff. And know what, if you faint, you faint, you won't be the first and the hospital is the best place to do it. No one is going to bat an eye and you at least tried. \n\nMaybe talk to your doctor about the anxiety you have over this and maybe they can prescribe you something to help keep your nerves settled during the delivery as well.  \n\nThere will be a lot going on during labor.  Your going to be more focused on your wife than you realize. \n\nRight now YTA because you won't at least try.  A human being is about to exit her body.  She's doing all the hard work. Make an attempt at the very least.", "Big fucking ooooof.\n\nAs someone who just had an emergency csection a week ago... It is VERY scary and all you want is some kind of stability aka your partner, as you dont know what's going on, \n\nBut i also think it's good you're aware that you could pass out, and don't want the docs worried about you. This is a tough one OP", "YTA. Not intentionally I don't think. But you don't have to see a thing if you don't want to. My husband would have seen all the nitty gritty if I had allowed him to, but I wanted him by my head so he could put a cool cloth on my head, with lots of pressure, the entire time as that's the only thing that felt okay in the moment. You can sit next to your wife and concentrate on her without seeing any of the gore. And, as I saw another user mention, the medical staff are totally prepared for woozy husbands lol! You wouldn't be the first or the last.  \n\n\nEdit: Forgot the word \"head\" lol", "YTA - your wife will be going through the scariest event she will ever go through and you are being mardy about the site of blood. Go in there and hold her stand and stay away from the business end, you will barely see anything. If you can\u2019t support her through this then what use are you really?", "You have had how many months to get a grip of your fear? Maybe go learn some coping strategies like an adult. Your wife can't refuse to give birth due to being scared of what her body is about to go through. \n\nHonestly, leaving your wife for your own comfort is a massive AH move and will damage your relationship moving forward. She will forever know that the moment she needed you most, you bailed. Your child will learn you bailed as their birth will be discussed many times in their life. \n\nYou also have a child that will likely have accidents that result in blood or even broken bones. What will you do then? Run away and leave a child on their own?", "Info: You said that if you fainted the doctor would have to pay attention to you instead of your wife. That's not true, as far as I know. The proper thing for them to do is to step over you and leave you lying there. At most they would drag you out of the way. Has any doctor told you that a perfectly healthy man who fainted for psychological reasons and didn't hit head would be a higher priority than a woman and children in the middle of birth?\n\nYour wife has no choice but to be in the room. There are many things that you can do to support her and be there without having to even look at this disgusting, horrible thing she is doing that you find so gross and unbearable. s/\n\nA friend of mine fainted at a scan, because he was so overwhelmed by the reality of his child and the responsibility. He still figured out how to be there with his partner for the birth. You can too, and if you don't, then yes YTA.\n\nCongrats to you both", "So... your wife has been going through nine months of nausea, physical discomfort and hormonal changes and on top of that has to push a baby out of her vagina, but you - who hasn't had to deal with any of that - can't muster up the courage to only be present for the birth of your child? Yes, YTA.\n\nBeing there for her, mentally supporting her, holding her hand, all of those things will be a huge help and comfort to your wife. Nobody says you have to look up close at her vagina or look at any of the fluids/blood. Just look at her face or even the damn wall and support her.", "YTA. Suck it up and support your wife. You don\u2019t actually have to see any blood or the baby coming out if you stand by her head and only look at her. You are basically there to tell her it\u2019s okay and she\u2019s doing great when in pain.", "Soft YTA, this is a major life event and not only will your wife not be happy (to say the least) if you're not there but you may regret it. You don't have to look at anywhere other than her face and hold her hand.\n\nWhen I was pregnant, I wouldn't watch any birth videos or pictures, they wouldn't have helped me as, however terrified/horrified I was by certain aspects, it's not like I had a choice - the baby has to come out somehow!!\n\nYou may have found that people will gleefully tell you their birth horror stories, why? Unfortunately, I haven't got any - 2 baby boys, straightforward delivery, no stitches so not much blood and gore - but I was so glad my husband was there.\n\nWhat's the worst that will happen? You pass out, as someone has already said, they'll have protocols in place for this but the risk of this should be outweighed by your wife's desire to have you there.", "YTA if you refuse but you can still explain your worries to her. \n\nAlso, doctors and nurses in delivery have seen it all. If you pass out, you won't be the first. \n\nBut ultimately, this is a scary, hard, and dangerous thing for your wife to go through and she needs your support. Step up and be there for her.", "Have you taken childbirth classes? You don\u2019t need to be down there looking at all the gory details\u2026stand by her head and hold her hand while encouraging her. Get her ice chips and rub her back. YTA.", "The fact that you\u2019re ashamed to feel this way because it *makes you look weak* and it\u2019s not because you\u2019re ashamed of abandoning your wife during one of the scariest and most traumatic time of a woman\u2019s life says everything. \n\nGet over yourself and support the woman who is birthing your child.", "NAH. You're not an AH for having a phobia and being anxious about this. But she's also not an AH for wanting support while she physically goes through this. Giving birth is scary and having someone to hold your hand and advocate for you is important.\n\nMy concern is how are you going to handle parenting? There's a lot of mess involved; blood, vomit, all sorts. And how will you care for her? It's going to take her a while to heal. Are you doing anything to manage this? Because you need to.", "YTA hold her hand or something if you stay beside her you won't really see what happens down there.", "YTA. You don't have to look at the lower half, and the nurses are used to baby daddies being fragile. You can't refuse to be there for one of the most meaningful and traumatic experiences she will ever endure because you might get queasy. If you know you have this problem  then ask your doctor to  provide you with antinausea medication. \nAsk for zofran, puke in a bucket if you gotta, make sure you're seated out of the way if the staff, and rally, my fren. \n\n**But you *need* to get her a childbirth advocate or a doula, you have the spine of a sponge. Consent violations are incredibly common in childbirth and she needs someone who will stick up for her and protect her,  and that is not you.**", "YTA - You can stand by your wife's head and feed her ice chips when asked. (The icky view is from the other end.) If things get too queasy, you can stumble out the door. (The medicals have seen that before and are ready for it.)

Look, my ex husband is the same, he sees a needle and he faints, he sees blood and he faints. He was there for every birth to hold my hand and just support me through it all. Did he faint? Yeah one time he did, he went to hold our daughter and I guess everything caught up with him. But the doctors and nurses are aware that stuff happens and they were able to catch him and give him some smelling salts and some water. He was just fine and you will be too.\n\nAt the end of the day your wife rather have you in the room, even passed out at her side than outside leaving her all alone. She has every right to be upset at you over this.", "The good news is that if you did pass out the doctors are not going to prioritize you at all.\n\nI was in the delivery room for a friend and they made us all sign waivers(like 18 years ago) saying that if we fainted that we wouldn't be the focus for the doctor or nurses. So they might just leave you there unless you are bleeding out or something. Or they'll drag you out so they can move you and deal with you elsewhere", "Sorry to say it, but yes, you aita. Your reasons are not enough to excuse you from supporting you wife while she's in pain and RISKING HER LIFE.\n\nYou can just sit in a chair (so if you faint you don't fall) facing her head, (so you don't see any blood), and tough it out.\n\nDo you think the doctor's going to stop what he's doing to take care of you if you faint? No. The nurses (there will be several) will do it, and you won't be the first.\n\nYou are going to be a father. That means putting a loved one's safety above your own comfort. ALWAYS.

I am not sad about not seeing him come into the world but every day I regret not being with my wife when she needed me most. She had a great midwife team but she was alone, in pain without me there fighting for her corner if she needed it.\n\nI might get some flack but dad's do get treated as an add on during birth and yes we are not the focus but we are part of it, even if it is just for our partners. The NHS was brilliant with me when our first was born but the older midwife was awful and the second, time treated me and my wife like we were idiots.

But BE THERE FOR HER.\n\nETA:  Maybe you can be there virtually, such as on speakerphone or with a point of view that you can't see the yucky stuff.  I just suggest any way you can support your wife at all that you *can* stomach.", "YTA\n\nAlso, you are wildly uninformed about what is required.   \n\n\nChildbirth is not like the movies. Most of it has no blood and no doctors and nothing but your wife in a room and the nurse checking in every half hour or so. It is often very long and draining. It can be hours to literal days, but 10 hours of  labour is not uncommon. \n\nStay with your wife. Bring her drinks and ice and hold her hand. Ask qustions and pass on messages to the nurses. Discuss her opinions on pain management and how she wants those decisions to be made.  Advocate for those decisions if needed.   \n\n\nThis is much more like supporting her during a marathon, than a medical surgery.   \n\n\nIf you are inclined to faint (not uncommon) let the nurses know beforehand, let them know you won't be cuting the cord and request a chair so you have a place to sit.", "Ok, so, 1) labour takes ages. For first time mothers it's usually 12 to 19 hours but can last DAYS. \n\n2) most of that time is fully clothed, nothing to see. You will be providing emotional support, fetching stuff like drinks, and supporting her to make important medical decisions. \n\n3) the pushing, messy part is a) beautiful, b) lasts maybe an hour, and c) you can stay away from the business end. Keep a chair so you can sit if you feel weird. \n\nSo, YTA. You need to read and learn about how birth actually works and step up for your wife and child. You're going to be a father soon - go get your big boy pants on. \n\nAlso, shit can go wrong and your wife needs you.

She said it\u2019s important for her that I\u2019m there for support and comfort and that she would feel vulnerable and abandoned and alone if I weren\u2019t. \n\nNow, I desperately want my wife to be as comfortable as she possibly could and I want to be there for her every step of the way but the truth is, I honestly don\u2019t know if I would be able to help her much. I fear I would collapse and the doctors would have to deal with me instead of her and that just isn\u2019t rational. I get very sick at the sight of blood, I know, it\u2019s probably stupid but I can\u2019t help it, I\u2019ve fainted a dozen times because of this and I just know I would be more of a hindrance to her than help. \n\nOne of our friends gave up a video recording of his wife giving birth and I couldn\u2019t watch it. I understand, childbirth is a very natural, amazing and wonderful event but what I saw, little as it was, on that video still haunts me.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m pretty ashamed of this because it makes me feel weak and I hate that I can\u2019t be there for my wife. I understand that she has to actually go through all of that not just see it, but my bottom line is that I\u2019m convinced I won\u2019t be able to stay and support her - I\u2019ll either have to leave the room or just pass out next to her. \n\nShe got very upset when I told her all that and we\u2019ve barely spoken since.

I will suggest go with her to her next appointment and let the doctor know you're worried about passing out and your aversion to the sight of blood and go from there.

Ask for a sheet to be hung so you can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening at the business end.  Ask if it\u2019s possible to have a small stool or chair in the delivery room where you can sit down.  Find out if there\u2019s an option for both of you to wear headphones and listen to the same music together so you can focus on being in the moment with your wife and hear less of the medical sounds (you\u2019ll both need to be able to hear instructions of course, so noise cancelling won\u2019t be an option but perhaps noise softening is).  They may have other creative suggestions too, you\u2019re not the first person to struggle with this.  \n\nNext, find a mental health professional with experience working with phobias and start working with them immediately.  You still have a number of weeks to get ready and while I\u2019m not claiming you\u2019ll be \u201ccured\u201d by then a professional can help reduce the fear a bit and also teach you techniques to stay grounded and not faint when you\u2019re in the delivery.  \n\nTalk to your doctor and see if there\u2019s an anti-anxiety med they can prescribe for you to take when you guys get to the hospital.  \n\nDo some googling and find information (from legitimate professionals) about how not to faint at the sight of blood.\n\nLook, you\u2019re about to be a parent and I hate to break it to you but kids bleed a lot.

But I guess your amazement about the tiny creature will help keep you strong, if not, just stay seated. They clean baby quite quickly.

Because for her it's the scariest and most painful moments in her life, and she will need you. Maybe get additionally a doula to be there if your knees are week, then you stay seated cheering your wife on but doula can assist more physically.

Choosing not to be there will cause resentment that will never go away.\n\nTake a birthing classes with her and get used to the idea of being in the room. Make a birthing plan with her.  Play calm music. Stand or sit near her head, hold her hand, stare into her eyes, stroke her head, encourage her and BE THERE. \n\nThe fear and uncomfortableness at the thought of birth is NORMAL. Being an adult, a spouse and a parent means doing what you must for the people around you, even if you are anxious or scared.  Don't worry about fainting. It happens to lots of people.

He even cut the cord (which in a million years I would never believe he would!)  For our firstborn, I ended up with him and both our moms in the room.  For the next 2 births, it was just us.\n\nHe still has an aversion to hospitals and dislikes doctors, but he managed to control it in his excitement to see his daughter being born.\n\nOP, you might surprise yourself.

This is mostly for not discussing how intense this phobia is with your wife prior to getting pregnant, and causing her stress at this point in her pregnancy. \n\nI'm not going to shame you. Phobias are valid. The feelings you will experience are undoubtedly visceral and unbidden, and hard to control. It's important to remember something, though: You love your wife. You love your baby. You're going to be a daddy. There is a place deep inside you that is capable of being incredibly strong for them. I think you need to focus on that, and become determined to be your wife's rock. This is going to be one of the most difficult, painful, vulnerable, and scary moments of her life. Hopefully the most magical of both of yours as well. You are going to welcome a miracle into the world - don't you want to be there? \n\nI suggest you talk to your wife again. Hold her hand and reassure her that you want to be there for her. Tell her you will try your best. Plan on staying up by her head, stay seated, rub her back and kiss her face and try to make it easier for her. Have a back up person if you need some fresh air. I have every belief that you can do this. \n\nIn the meantime, I believe you should look into some therapy to help you deal with your phobia. You should have some coping mechanisms to help you when you feel overwhelmed. (Perhaps even talk to your doctor about anxiety medication for the day of the birth) Your wife will need your help after she gives birth. She'll be bleeding and in pain for weeks afterwards, and may need assistance cleaning herself or the sheets. If she has a C-section, you might need to take on more baby duties. Occasionally baby girls can have a false menses, which is from their mother's hormones. There are many, many things in your future that will involve bodily fluids and blood...

So weigh that too.", "I'm going to say soft YTA but I'll explain why from the perspective of someone who's given birth. \n\nLabor is usually a long, painful and incredibly scary event. You're also extremely vulnerable and it's really hard to advocate for yourself if the doctor or nurse starts being pushy or doing something you don't want/need. \n\nTo do that alone would be way more traumatic than a usual birth. What if there are complications? She'd be alone and terrified while things escalated and she'd have no support or comfort. \n\nYou don't have to actually witness the baby crowning and coming out of your wife. My husband stayed right beside me cheering me on and holding my hand or wiping my forehead. He did the most important job to me which was letting me know he was there and had my back if I needed him. \n\nYou're making this about yourself and your fear of seeing something gross. What you're failing to realize is your wife has no choice but to go through this physically traumatic event. She's scared. I guarantee she's terrified of the pain and possibility of something bad happening to her or to the baby. And you just told her that you refuse to be there in her greatest time of need because you're afraid!?! Get some perspective. \n\nYou're her partner. You're the person she's supposed to trust the most and be able to depend on you in any situation. You're failing her in this. Being in the room is important because she needs your support and she needs you there to advocate for her with the medical staff when she's unable to. You need to educate yourself on what could happen and what your wife's wishes are so that you can help her.", "NAH, but my friend, this is the time to sort out the details of the thing so you can both just focus on your partner and your new tiny human. Broad blanket statements like \"I can't do this at all\" are not helpful or accurate.

Easy peasy and you're far from the first person to have a fear of blood.\n\n\nIf you're worried about getting faint and passing out, communicate that concern to the medical team *before* things start getting busy. They'll do what they can to minimize the risks: give you a chair, maybe antianxiety meds or a snack, and generally have a plan in place in case you pass out and someone needs to get you out of the way.\n\n\nAs long as you're putting clear effort into getting your needs accommodated, it's not as big a deal if you do pass out or need a break on the day of.

Stay up by her head, talk to her, hold her hand, and don't look.\n\nBut you need to be in the room if she wants you there, because the stress of you not being there can potentially be problematic to the point of dangerous to your wife and your child.\n\nYeah, you might faint. The doctors are going to prioritize your wife's care, they're not going to stop delivering the baby if you drop to the floor. If you're really concerned about it, ask one of the nurses to step to the side, explain your history, and ask if there's a procedure for people who might faint. She can maybe keep an eye out for you while attending to your wife, or have someone else come in when it's go time (an extra person) who can get you out of the way if necessary. Maybe you can sit in a chair or on a stool at your wife's head, so if you faint you won't hurt yourself hitting the floor.\n\nThere are lots of ways to participate and support your wife that don't involve being face to face with the goriest parts of childbirth.

You don't need to 'see' anything, you can just hold her hand and be the emotional support she needs. Also, there is a huge difference between watching the video of someone else's partner and you actually being there. You're turning the fear (which a lot of men have) of your wife in pain and potentially distressed, with blood and very medial language, into a huge monster. In reality, you're likely to be far too caught up in the emotion and exhilaration of your wife giving birth to your first baby. \n\nTalk to your wife, but importantly, also talk to the delivery team.

You don't have to see the blood. They can put a sheet up to block the view. I totally get where you are coming from. Birth is a wonderful thing, but its also messy, sweaty, bloody, and a lot of other gross things. But your wife needs you there for support. Giving birth, whether natural or c section, is really hard and grueling. All you have to do is hold her hand so she can break yours (lol) and focus on her face, talk to her, keep her hair out of her face, pat her with a cool wash cloth, tell her she's doing great and it's almost over and how much you love her. Oh another thing you can do is let the doc/nurses know that blood makes you faint and request an extra nurse specifically to monitor you. I had a friend who did this.

There is no controlling it, and you're naturally concerned that you'll take the staff's attention from your wife and child onto you should you not be able to make it. \n\nI get it; you're both overwhelmed by the reality of what this birth is going to entail and the demands the process will make of both of you.\n\nMy suggestion? Largely ignore Reddit and talk with your wife's doctor about the problem. I promise you that you're not the first couple who are dealing with this issue. You are not the first-- nor will you be the last-- father in the delivery room who can't stomach the sight of blood \\[or the other fluids that come with the process\\]. The doctor and nurses will no doubt have plenty of advice for you regarding what you can do before going in and what they will do to help you once you're there.

Would she consider having her mom or a hired doula as a support person, and you can be waiting right outside?   If you try to overcome your fear, but end up having to leave the room, will that be okay with her? How many people are allowed in the delivery room? If there can be two family member/support people, then you can try to be there, and if it's too much, you can step away but she would still have a support person.\n\nPersonally, I would rather have my husband happy and safe in the waiting room and ready to help care for the baby after the birth, than end up with a newborn and a husband who has a concussion because he fell out and smacked his head.\n\nBut there's also a very good chance that you would be fine.", "What has been mentioned.  You will do so much for your wife and you don't realize it.  Emotional support is a big one.

Get over yourself.", "I was just as freaked out and worried about my likely reaction as you are. The solution was to be candid with the birth team about it, and they set up the room so that I would see nothing but would be present for support. Ended up being a C-section and I still didn't flip out or faint. And it was awesome to be there for my son's first moments.  So, that's the answer. You are not the first guy in this position and won't be the last. Birth teams deal with people like us every week. But you gotta do it, with their help.\n\nAnd don't keep telling yourself that it will go badly.  It might not! Emphasize the good possibilities, to yourself.", "YTA. You don't have to look down. You should be able to sit there with your wife, hold her hand and watch her face. Are you scared her eyeballs are going to start bleeding?

Standing by the head rather than full view, doing childbirth preparation classes, etc.\n\nYour phobia is not uncommon and is totally valid, especially for what I deduce to be an already anxious first-time-parent.

I also think the longer you sit and think about it, the worse it is going to be in your head.  I would say try talking to others who have actually been in the room, ask questions, sometimes the more you know the less you fear.\n\nHowever, the wife also kinda sucks here.  This phobia/issue of yours did not pop up during all of this I am betting.  Likely for your entire relationship this has been known.

It's totally normal for her to be upset about this; she's scared and excited and wants to go through both things with you at her side! She probably feels abandoned.\n\nSo, I offer a compromise: you're present in the delivery room, but you stay up near her head, facing away from the delivering area.

If you don't look down there you won't see anything. Focus on her, use reading her face and comforting her as your task and focus point. She needs you to be her advocate, her voice when she can't think of anything but the pain and pushing the baby out, you need to be the one that makes sure nothing happens without consent, the one that makes sure her birth plan and wishes are seen to, you are going to be the voice she hears if something needs explaining urgently. You are her calm in her storm. That's manly as fuck! It takes strength to do that especially in a situation that is stressful and unknown to you too.\n You don't need to take your eyes off her and see anything else that is going on. Midwifes are generally pretty good at cleaning it up sharpish.\nOh and buzz for/ask a close relative/friend or midwife to be there for the first shower after.

For the refusal but also how you're talking about yourself!\n\nFirst off-- fainting at the sight of blood does not make you weak. This is normal for so many people!\n\nSecond-- you are unlikely to see blood during delivery, especially if you're focused on your wife and holding har hand/keeping her hair out of her face.\n\nSecond.1-- if you do see the blood and pass out, you will have gone into the room knowing full well that you'd be rolled out, but nothing would gonna stop you from trying to support your wife and greeting your child together.\n\nThird-- this is not just scary for you. Your wife is going to be delivering your baby. Modern medicine is good and all, but she's got a whole lot of stuff going through her mind about it! All of the potential \"what if\" scenarios are probably driving her mad.\n\nFourth-- unless a couple is adopting or using a surrogate, the mother has no option other than carrying and delivering the baby. You do not. Do not consider your presence optional-- your wife and baby NEED you.\n\nCongratulations on the soon-to-be baby, and please consider finding a good therapist so you can be there for your child as they grow.

It's not because I don't care, it's because I'm afraid the doctors will have to take care of me instead of you. I don't want that.\"\n\nFINAL BIG TAKEAWAY TIP: Hire a doula! Doulas don't just provide emotional and physical support to the birthing partner, but to the non-birthing partner, as well. And they're an expert. They'll tell you what you can do to support your wife, and respect your boundaries, at the same time. It will also help you feel less like you have to be \"on\" to have a professional there who is solely dedicated to the new parents' well-being and comfort.\n\nI wish you all the luck.

As a compromise, ask her if she will be ok having you there during the contractions (those take a while and usually the nurses and doctors won\u2019t be very involved during that time so she needs someone) and then maybe someone like her mother or a friend or a doula can sub in for you during the actual pushing (for emotional support as the nurses and doctors do their work).

You do not have to look/touch. Even if you're the person giving birth.

Given the option your wife probably doesn't want to be there either.  She is worried about being sick or fainting or pooping.  Blood is not her favorite thing. There are times in our lives when we have to do things that are uncomfortable or gross or terrifying.  This is one of those times.  But it has an amazing pay off at the end.   \n\nYour job is to shut and up do anything your wife needs you to do.  It may be holding her hand.  It may be talking to her to distract her.  It may be shutting the fuck up so she can concentrate.  It may be getting water or reminding her that she is beautiful and doing a great job.  \n\n By our second delivery my husband understood his only jobs were to keep his mouth closed,  hold the rolly table while I leaned on it and to get the nurse when I was ready for drugs.  \n\nBut most importantly your job is to be present.  Especially if it turns into a complicated delivery.\n\nAnd as frightening as this is you will be so glad that you sucked it up and did it.   BTW this is good practice for the rest of your life for when your child breaks their arm or your wife gets a post surgical infection and you have to give her IV antibiotics for 6 weeks or your dad needs you at his bedside in ICU.  This is life.  We don't get to skip the bad stuff.", "YTA.

Your instructor can help with this. \n\nAlso your friend is nuts for showing you a video of his wife in labour. Hope he had her permission. Either way cameras do not belong anywhere near a labouring woman. \n\nAs many have pointed out, you\u2019ll likely be up by her head so it should be fine. I\u2019d make it clear to the docs that you\u2019re not comfortable cutting the cord either if that\u2019s your decision. \n\nLabour is a remarkable process and I think you\u2019d regret not being there for your wife and newborn. \n\nCongratulations and good luck!", "Not in the US but my husband stayed at my head, held my hand and talked to me.

It will mean everything, and if you intend to be a true partner, this is part of it.\n\nI lost twins a few months ago, and had to be induced and give birth knowing they wouldn't survive. Having my husband there was the only thing that held me together. He says he was terrified that he'd lose me too, and I know he didn't WANT to see what he saw, but he was there. He didn't leave my side. Having him there helped me be able to focus in on what my body was telling me and do what I needed to do. He felt helpless because he thought he wasn't doing anything, but I wouldn't have been able to stay calm or cooperate with the medical team as well on my own. I had him there to advocate for me in case I wanted meds or was a bit doped up. It's an important safety measure as well as emotional support.\n\nGiving birth is also a long process - from the beginnings of labor until full delivery can take hours or even days. Even for me, with an induced labor and no concern for the babies' survival - only mine at that point - I was still in the hospital for two nights. But, yeah, the actual delivery is where she will be the most vulnerable and where she will need you the most.\n\nDon't abandon her to a long and scary process. Giving birth is sometimes dehumanizing - she will need you to advocate for her wishes and needs. My husband stayed with me because we are PARTNERS and because we, together, are parents. We are a team, and neither of us will abandon the other during times like this.", "This should become a first date question to weed out the weak ones, \"are you going to be present for the birth of your child?\"", "NTA and I apologize for the other women saying you are.

Nor is it something you can control. If it happens then it happens. Your wife will see that you tried your best. \n\nThis is unrelated but I\u2019ve heard from vet friends that when a pet is being put down and the owner is too upset to watch, some of the last and most anxious moments for the pet is looking around for their owner. Instead, wouldn\u2019t it be beautiful to compromise on our discomfort to give the pet moments of comfort? \n\nNo your wife isn\u2019t a pet. But trust me, if you\u2019re not in that room, she will always remember that you didn\u2019t even try to face your fears for her. Don\u2019t do that to yourselves. You\u2019ve got this!", "Yeah this is good advice. I passed out during my son's birth (apparently needles to the spine is a trigger for me) and everyone continues on doing what they're doing, it's not that disruptive. And you really don't have to see any of the \"gross\" stuff. Someone else mentioned getting a doula and I would second it as well. I kinda thought they were holistic bs beforehand but ours was super helpful and really alleviated a lot of stress before, during, and even after the birth. I guess my main point is passing out isn't a big deal, but being there for your wife during is a big deal.", "this is a good reply. overcoming fear to comfort someone is always heartwarming, and she\u2019ll be relieved to have someone in her corner no matter what.", "This, OP! Many people have these fears and it\u2019s okay! You don\u2019t need to look at anything down there. You do, however, need to push past this for your wife. If you start to feel dizzy or like you might pass out, sit down. The hospitals are used to husbands fainting. It\u2019s ok if you do! Try to sit down so you don\u2019t fall and hit your head. That\u2019s all. You\u2019re not weak for feeling this way. My best dude friend just went through this, and much to his and everyone\u2019s surprise, he didn\u2019t pass out! We all thought he would for sure bc the tiniest sight of blood makes him dizzy. But he got lucky! You might get lucky too and not even faint. Just be prepared knowing that you might and don\u2019t hit your head. Your wife will always think back on that day fondly knowing you overcame fears to be there for her. It\u2019s okay and good on you for having this inner dialogue to try to push past it. \nI\u2019m going with NAH bc your intentions are good and it\u2019s scary the first time. If you don\u2019t push past this, you\u2019ll become the AH tho, so just know her feelings are valid as well. I wouldn\u2019t want to give birth alone either. You are both scared and it\u2019s normal! You\u2019ll be better off doing this together!", "I wonder if some temporary anti-anxiety meds would help too.", "Yea, I don\u2019t get this. It\u2019s not like he needs to deliver the baby himself. Just stay near her head and he won\u2019t see much.\n\nYTA", "Agreed. Blood/needle phobias are extremely treatable with exposure therapy (as are all phobias), and can be treated relatively quickly. Granted, not everyone knows that, but I\u2019m shocked that he waited until a month before she\u2019s due to have this discussion or make a plan.", "I don't think OP would help the situation by passing out onto the delivery room floor.", "That's the  kind of answer this post needs", "If things go sideways and OP isn\u2019t there because \u201cew, blood,\u201d he\u2019s probably getting divorced.

I have relatives with medical phobias, and can accept that maybe there are some people who would be more hindrance than help in a birthing suite. But he should have told her before even trying for a baby, so that she could go in with her eyes open. Honestly, if I had a partner who wouldn't even try therapy or something to prepare, I might not choose to have a biological child with them. \n\nIf he'd talked about this months ago, he could have a working relationship with a therapist and have done exposure therapy, or gotten medication. Waiting until they are a month or so out, give or take, is absolutely horrible.", "I think that the biggest factor to me is that he only had this discussion with her now. He's known that she was pregnant for months now, and could have told her much sooner (and ideally before getting pregnant but I know some things aren't planned) that he wouldn't do this, so she could go in with her eyes open, and if she chose to, get used to the idea and have a support person in mind well in advance. Springing this on her last minute is horrible.", "If a patient has an epidural then any position that requires the legs bear weight is going to be a nono for hospitals. The fall risk is just too great. That still leaves side pushing though. If no epidural, then there are plenty of options. The beds have slots for a squat bar for a reason. It's just a matter of finding a doctor that is willing before it all goes down. \n\nIn my admittedly limited experience (haven't been a L&D nurse long) the obgyns that have a large number of immigrant patients are far more flexible. The younger docs are as well.", "It is also a liability for them, you could slip and fall in the fluids and injure yourself, or the baby could hit the floor and sustain a head injury when it comes out.  I know crouching can be easier and better for the mother but it isn't without risks.

His anxiety is fixated on the certainty that he will be seen and judged without any option to retreat. Every tickle in his throat tells him he's going to make a scene, coughing or throwing up, etc.\n\nI ended up having an emergency induction followed by an emergency csection and he was very uncomfortable that the hospital had the nurse stay in the room non-stop during labor. I didn't realize they'd be there 100% of the time either but he was very tense. I think he anticipated being focused on me and distracted by my needs but he felt like he was intruding and got into his own anxiety when he didn't have enough else to focus on. Then when it was clear my BP was dropping and the baby's heart rate was not stable, he was so unsure of being in the OR. The anesthesiologist drew a diagram of the room on the white board so he could understand where he would be and how to leave without disrupting the procedure.

Things went fine for a while, but the pain was getting tougher and tougher to bear. I was dilating, but the baby wasn't descending. I ended up getting the epi at 9cm dilated (yes, you CAN get one when you're that far along). \n\nDoc got it in quickly, pain relief was near instantaneous. Well, within minutes, I said to the midwife, I need to push. With the pain gone, I (and my muscles) were relaxed and that baby moved right down.

He\u2019s not an asshole because he\u2019s scared or squeamish. Those are valid. He\u2019s an asshole because he doesn\u2019t seem to have tried any alternative to abandoning his wife during labor. I\u2019m sure his wife is preparing for labor- reading books, consulting with her medical team, maybe physically preparing herself. He could do the same thing but he\u2019s too busy feeling sorry for himself.", "I've been a big believer of that too.

Solidarity!", "I pushed for 3 hours as well! And then he did a little cut and my son popped right out.", "Sure, but he should have told her this well in advance (ideally before they tried for a baby, but I know not everything is planned) so that she could go in with her eyes open and pick another support person/make sure they're okay with it/make sure they're able to get time off work or travel so they're available, etc.\n\nI can accept that some people shouldn't be in the L&D room. But he never should have waited until 35 weeks to tell her.", "Yeah, I could move after my epidurals. The only thing I was told not to do was to get up and try to walk as my legs would likely not support me. I was definitely able to move though.", "Same! My husband is also squeamish and didn\u2019t handle the operating room well but he huddled down by my head behind the sheet. Neither of us were interested in seeing anything.", "I think it was a few days later that they took him off life support, but still super tragic.", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you! This is exactly the kind of situation I\u2019m talking about; the anesthesiologist should\u2019ve provided patient education in this case about exactly what was going on and why, but instead didn\u2019t want to admit that the epidural got messed up. It happens, own up to it and fix it, or talk about options and whether or not you even wanted to continue to try and get the epidural to work once you have all the info! One of my biggest pet peeves is the lack of education for epidurals. Lots of them don\u2019t work, or only work on one half of the patients body, so patients aren\u2019t adequately educated/prepared for what to expect with one. That\u2019s a failing of the doctors and I\u2019m sorry they stunk so much. There\u2019s so much \u201chiding\u201d things from patients in healthcare and it\u2019s so annoying and does more harm than good; I\u2019ve experienced it firsthand when a doctor doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m also in healthcare, and their tune completely changes when I tell them.

Try to figure out ways to prevent and get in there. \n\nWhy are some men so incompetent, just figure out solutions.\n\nYTA", "YTA - I am very similar to you, although maybe not quite as squeamish. My wife gave birth a few months ago and it is really important to remember that it is not about you. That doesn't mean your feelings are invalid, just that you need to focus on her and her needs.\n\nAlso, you are just guessing as to your reaction. There is only one way to find out. You just might surprise yourself.\n\nOne thing that helped me was that I said I did not want to cut the cord. But, when the time came and they asked I accepted and did it.

People frequently pass out giving blood, but syncope is not a disqualifier for giving blood because the benefit to others outweighs the risk to you. If you feel faint or are prone to fainting, ameliorative measures are taken and business continues. The husband in your story appears to have taken no preventative measure at all and just dropped like a log. That wouldn't be the case here because OP is fully aware of his tendency to faint and they can plan for it in advance.", "I am not trying to be facetious or start some kind of flame war...just genuinely curious.  But why is convenience for the doctor...a bad thing?  Of course the Mother's comfort should come first but I would figure the person getting the baby out of you and there in case shit hits the fan should be able to have secondary convenience?  Again, genuinely curious on the reasoning....", "Watching the video was the worst idea ever I believe (who would even show that??).\n\nBut yeah, I guess the idea of the baby was abstract and the childbirth distant, and suddenly, poof! 9 months went by. I can understand: you push in the back of your head what scares you until it explodes.", "Not entirely true.  I have been specifically told not to give blood due to my syncope.  The number of flippant nurses who thought they could take my blood, insert an IV etc without my passing out is funny and insane, cause they freak out as it happens.   According to my wife paerly because I fight it so hard it looks like I'm seizing and then my BP drops so low it sets off the crash cart...", "The \"man up\" refers to being there despite having this tendency, and taking whatever measures necessary--sit in a chair, take a valium, whatever--to make it possible.

Please give me a blind fold instead. \n\nMy husband watched everything with both of my births. I had complications during both deliveries with my placenta so there was a lot of blood in both cases and a lot of people swarming around me. I don\u2019t think he could have avoided seeing blood and goo if he wanted to. \n\nMy second birth was last year, and I felt very faint after my delivery. My husband was the one who rushed out of the room to tell the doctors something was wrong. When the nurse came back in and pushed on my stomach, my husband said blood just splurted everywhere like something from a horror movie. I was hemorrhaging. I had to go to straight to the operating room for a D & C while people scrambled to get me set up for a blood transfusion. \n\nEveryone reacts differently to blood and goo. \n\nBut everyone deserves and needs support. \n\nI almost died during childbirth. I would have always remembered if my husband wasn\u2019t there for me.", "I did the same thing!  I watched the whole thing in the reflection of the lights overhead.  It was so weird.
