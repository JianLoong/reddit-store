But as she got older, my mother starting getting obsessed with the kid she abandoned. Paying different private investigators, talking about it non stop. We'll be walking down the street, she'd see an older woman that looks black/mixed and she'd go \"Maybe that could be my daughter\".\n\nIt makes me feel like me and my siblings aren't enough. She has 4 kids that love her and all she talks about is a person she knows nothing about, has never seen. I mean it's been more than 50 years!!!\n\nIf she ever find her daughter then we'll have a whole new person in the family, split inheritance etc... I am perfectly happy the way our family is.\n\nMy mother has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease this summer. She told us \" My last wish is to find my baby\". I am freaking offended , so we aren't good enough for her. She abandoned her baby herself, why do we have to pay the price of her poor decisions.

It worries me that someone of your age hasn\u2019t evolved to a decent human being that is capable to see things objectively instead of making it all about him. You sound like a teenager.\n\nAll I can say is that your mothers feelings about her first born say nothing about the love she has for you.

I am speaking from experience here too. I have an aunt who went missing. My Grandmother missing her, crying on her birthday or the day she vanished never once meant that her other five children were 'not enough', it meant that she simply *also* loved her other child who had been taken from her. I never knew my family with my aunt in it, but it made me no less offended when my Grandmother missed my Aunt, nor did it leave anyone else offended, and when we did finally find her it made me no less relieved for my Grandmother or my mother and my aunts and uncles, and my cousins who had not known where their mother was until then. \n\nYour mother did not abandon anyone. She clearly loved the child she gave up, and never stopped loving her, and had she had a real choice, likely never would have given her up in the first place.

This is not about you at all, and for the inheritance, it's her freaking money, not yours.", "Here me out, \nMaybe just MAYBE she can love more than one child at a time???? Maybe she has regrets, and she just wants to see how her child grew up without her and apologize for having to put her up for adoption? It sounds like it wasn't even her choice to give the baby up, but her parents MADE her. Yet you want to complain that she isn't giving you attention. \n\nWow, grow the f up dude. \n\nYTA. \nYou don't deserve whatever inheritance she had for you.", "YTA YTA! You even said your grandparents her parents MADE her give your SISTER, maybe a half but still, up for adoption at the beginning of your post then you say she \u201cabandoned \u201c the baby. #1\u2026. Adoption is not abandonment (I\u2019m adopted) #2\u2026.is an inheritance more important then your moms peace of mind as she getting closer to her time? #3\u2026.are you afraid that if she finds her daughter she\u2019s going to love you less? Or is it honestly just the inheritance you\u2019re wrote about? I think you are totally wrong in this situation. If you don\u2019t want to be helpful to your mom like your sister maybe just keep your negativity to yourself and let her do as she needs to feel whole again before she dies.", "YTA\n\nSo my mother had a child out of wedlock that she was forced to give up for adoption and I would have whole heartedly supported her if she had ever chosen to seek her out. As it was my sister was the one who made contact and its great. My mum was able to see that her child had thrived, was able to heal from the guilt and trauma of her \"choice\", my sister was able to learn about her family history and discover a whole family that made us all bigger and I gained a sister.\n\nYou want to deny that to your family? Your mum didn't abandon her baby, she had no real choice except to give up her baby in the hope of a better life for them and you want to reinforce that trauma by punishing her further?\n\nYTA - big time!", "YTA! Have you ever had to give a child up? If you haven't, then you have no right to act so selfish. You are definitely enough for your mother but if she wants to find the girl that she was FORCED to give up, you should support her in that.", "I bet you didn't expect this reaction lol, YTA you're worried about money, which BTW, who says the daughter would want anything from your family anyway. You're not being considerate towards your sick mother and you said she gave the baby up because her parents were racist which means she probably wanted her baby but they wouldn't allow it not because she didn't want her. Honestly, I couldn't believe you had the audacity to say that you would suffer because she gave up her baby.", "YTA. I\u2019m not sure how you could think otherwise.  Stop thinking about the money and think with empathy for a bit. You may not care about your half sibling but you didn\u2019t carry her for 9 months.", "HUGE YTA. Self absorbed, unsympathetic, greedy, obnoxious to the point that I can hardly believe it\u2019s real that somebody could type that out and not understand what a woeful excuse for a human they are.", "When people get older they look back on their life, often with regrets. Mothers always have love for their children (GOOD moms I\u2019ll say, some people HAVE to give up babies for GOOD reasons!) YTA. Your mom isn\u2019t your cash cow. You should be excited at the thought of a potentially new person to meet! Y T A through and through.", "YTA, your sister is right, don't you really realize at your age how important family is? that lost half-sister is your family.  If your mom was forced to leave her and it tormented her all her life., just how important it is to her  to find inner peace. \n\nCan you really only think about dividing the inheritance? Do you even love your mom or are you just waiting for an inheritance?\n\n\rHer desire to find her lost daughter has nothing to do with her love for the rest of you..does someone really have to draw that for you?", "YTA", "YTA. It is clear you care about whether you have to share the inheritance you so clearly desire. Your mother has a lifelong regret from a decision that was made _for_ her. It's not that you and your siblings \"aren't good enough,\" it's that she had a kid taken from her that she would have wanted to love as much as she did the rest of you. \n\nBut you don't care about that, even though helping your mother might be as simple as a genetic test. DNA testing is quite accessible; it is quite possible her child has already done something like '23 and Me' hoping to find your mother (and the rest of you). And it wouldn't be 'for the money,' as you so desperately fear; she doesn't know any of you, so she doesn't know you're relatively well-off. \n\nI hope whatever you inherit is worth such a cruel stance towards your mother and your half sister (because she is your sibling, like it or not).", "I don't think you're completely TA. I understand how you feel because I've felt the same but my case was a little different. Hearing your mom, or anyone really, repeatedly talk about the same thing can get annoying. \n\nI (38F) have a brother (35M) who moved out a few years ago, for financial reasons I'm still with my parents. Every weekend we'd sit down to dinner (or just randomly) mom would say something about making more food in case my brother showed up. He rarely would. Now he lives at home and she hopes he'll get life together and move out again.\n\nStop thinking about the money and try to get in your mom's shoes. Your mom lost a baby she loves just as much as she loves you and your siblings. She would like to know how that baby lived, that she's well, before it's too late. Hopefully it's not already.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s a mother who loves all 5 of her children. Her wanting to find her lost child does not take away love from you. She carried that child in her body and it\u2019s half her DNA.", "YTA and how fact u wven mentioned inheritance proves it, your mum has every right to find her child.\nEeesh", "Wow! Sounds like your mom really needs help! How awful to only have 3-hours with your daughter because your parents are racist & force you to adopt out your baby.\n\nI think it would be wonderful if Reddit community can help find your mom\u2019s first-born daughter. \nMaybe suggest to your mom & white-sister to make a post with detailed info and let Reddit do the work? You may not have a black-sister but your siblings definitely do. \n\nThere is so much traffic on this YTA post. We all would support your mom & your white-sister in their search. \n\nJust something to think about!", "Probably the only thing he really cares about.", "OP should have started off with that. They are upset at the thought of having to share and getting less.", "Tried to sneak that in, like an afterthought.  Probably the most pertinent part of his post; everything else is just filler.", "They claim it\u2019s not about money but bring up the inheritance almost every comment and how the lost daughter shouldn\u2019t get any. They were also arguing about how they would inherit one less property when mom passes.", "I get the rest of it but the fact that \"split insurance\" came up at all is so telling. \n\nOP, YTA. The things you bring up are understandable but it honestly feels like window dressing for your main concern which is your inheritance and maybe you're playing things up for sympathy if your siblings are helping here and think YTA.", "Mother why do I have to share this amazing fortune with another? Isn't is bad enough I only get a quarter? Now you want to reduce me to a fifth!? Unacceptable!\n\nBut seriously tho YTA", "I was about to say the same thing", "I'll never understand people who write posts like this.  He's in charge of his own narrative and basically came right out and said it's about the money!", "Doesn\u2019t realize the inheritance can already have been split 5 ways and held in trust should the sister be discovered OR else donated to charity after some time. All he\u2019s doing is denying his mothers dying wish.", "You forgot the etc. He did say \"split inheritance etc.\" \ud83e\udd23", "I was thinking the same thing.", "Couldn't agree more! \n\nPerhaps add a verdict? Seems you are the/a top post!", "Yours is the top comment. You should add a judgement.", "I read this post thinking I was listening to a jealous 15 year old. 46, holy shit, what an AH", "_\"If she ever find her daughter then we'll have a whole new person in the family, split inheritance etc.\"_\n\nReading this, I kept thinking 'I wonder if this is about an inheritance?' And, sure enough, it sure was! OP is so exceptionally selfish, greedy, and cold that I legit have no words. I'm glad that OP's sibling is actually acting like a kind, empathetic, human being, and if the mother gets wind of OP's true feelings, I would not blame her from removing any kind of financial incentive from OP.", "This, right here.

Just like a big ball of assholes.", "I had to re-read OPs post because I was sure I read it incorrectly.... The comments proved that I -unfortunately- had not.", "Also, getting 20% of an inheritance vs. 25% is not THAT significant... yes I know it's a lot of money potentially but is that all you care about?", "YTA Not to mention there\u2019s a whole other life on the other side of this that could be missing her last chance to answer some life long questions about her birth mother. \n\nOP is a selfish prick and I hope he gets written out of the will entirely. People truly show their true colours when there\u2019s money on the line.", "Agreed!!! Imagine having a child like this?!\n\nWhat OP wants us to believe- I love my mother\n\nWhat OP is actually saying with their statements - I hope my mother never finds peace and dies unhappy.", "Agreed! But just want to add even if her mom \u201cdecided\u201d to give the child away, OP would still be an YA.", "That\u2019s how I felt I had to just stop type and end my comment.  Just disgusting behavior from a person (male female or whatever you identify as doesn\u2019t matter for decent behavior) who claims to be an adult (age is just a number in this situation)", "She doesn't care about her mother, it's all about the money.\n\nThe other side of the coin is that there's a lady out there who probably wonders why she was \"given away.\"  She will also never get closure.", "Same. Don\u2019t give up :) I found my other (paternal) side during Covid\u2026I\u2019m 49 lol. I did DNA tests on every possible site I could. And I found them. :)", "Agreed. OP is extremely callous.", "I can only hope OP is this callous because he doesn\u2019t have a child. Or else he\u2019s the worst parent ever. And I don\u2019t believe him when he says he didn\u2019t ever feel like they were enough. Mom has trauma and regret and all he cares about is money. YTA op and I hope your mom finds her daughter.", "Especially because, even if the inheritance *does* get split, assuming she gets an equal share, it goes from 4 parts to 5 parts. Oh no, you go from 25% to 20% - a whole 5% loss of money you didn\u2019t earn!", "This right here. YTA OP. Big time. You aren't good enough. Because you fucking suck. And you're a terrible son.", "So much this. It was 1967!  She had no say or choice in the matter.", "Yeah thats the truth of the post. Nothing to do with OP not feeling good enough he just doesn't want to share his inheritance.", "I was about to be gentle with OP because the writing sounded like a 14 year old.  It was startling to be reminded he was in his 40s at the end", "Not to mention that this was (seemingly) a mixed race kid in the 1960s. Maybe the baby grew up in the system? Maybe her adoptive family was cruel to her? Or maybe she found loving parents and siblings who adored her like their own? OP's mom deserves to know!", "Thank you, we\u2019ll said.", "My 5 year old has more empathy than this person.", "Definitely agree with YTA, and I find it sadly amusing that if she was legally adopted, she wouldn't be entitled to inherit in many jurisdictions unless mom had a will or trust that named her. And given how much mom has searched for her, I'm hoping she'll surprise everyone by naming her missing child for a share of her estate.", "This- mom might just want to meet daughter for closure. It doesn't have to be more than that.", "Yeah that mention of inheritance was chilling.", "I read this comment and then looped back to reread the post. Where does it imply that the Mom and sister were victims of child trafficking?\n\nI'm confused.", "I'll also add, my BIL's immediate thought was why she gave him up. Was she raped? Does it explain things he never knew about her? He never once considered his money or his fear.

The idea that this one child matters more then the life they had with their mother and how they feel like an after thought compared to this idea of a person to their mom. Not someone being their best emoathic selves but understandable. And then they drop the real reason, it's money out of their share when Mom passes.

Opps all racism.\"", "I agree it\u2019s a leap. But it\u2019s kinda obvious he doesn\u2019t consider his mothers feelings and is concerned about his share of the inheritance shrinking.
