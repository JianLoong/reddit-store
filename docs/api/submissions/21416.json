Cats are an invasive species and shouldn't be left to wander around the neighborhood unchecked, however, threatening to give her cat to the pound is definitely too far. A lot of people don't even know about how bad cats are for the ecosystem when they're allowed to free-roam and kill anything they want, and you approached her in an unreasonably hostile way. However, if it is the law in your county to have cats on leashes then she should be following that. But the way you approached the situation was unnecessarily hostile and unkind. A lot of people aren't educated on why outdoor cats are bad for ecosystems and approaching her in an unkind manner certainly isn't going to want to make her consider the effects of letting her cat outdoors.", "ESH. I personally fully agree with you that it\u2019s irresponsible to have \u2018outdoor cats\u2019. It\u2019s bad for the environment, disrespectful to your neighbors and unsafe for the cat.\n\nThat said, in some areas, especially rural ones, outdoor cats are very much baked into the culture. It sounds as if you are new to this community and didn\u2019t really bother to get to know your neighbors or ask questions about local norms before you went in imposing your personal values on everyone else. And honestly, not every battle is worth fighting\u2014 if you live in an area where lots of people have outdoor cats, are you going to spend the rest of your life in a miserable feud, dropping cats off at the pound left and right? It might be better to have peace with your neighbors and the annoyances of outdoor cats.\n\nIt\u2019s also not cool to waste your local animal shelter\u2019s resources when you know full well where this cat belongs.", "ESH\n\n\nI get your logic for trapping it the first time, but you can\u2019t threaten to steal other people\u2019s pets.  \n\nYour neighbor is an AH for telling you to F off and apparently gossiping to other neighbors.", "NTA.

The humane trap seems reasonable since she won't cooperate. And the other neighbor is an AH. \n\nBut it's someone's beloved cat. Maybe don't use the word predator  -- you're not wrong technically, but it's not how you gain cooperation from others. Just say you want to protect the birds on your property.", "NTA. You did what you could; outdoor cats are inherently dangerous to both the cat and the surrounding wildlife. If they can't keep their cat inside (and safe), they really shouldn't have a cat at all.", "YTA if you just take the cat to the pound. You can be pissed but what you can't do is steal someone's pet because you don't like what they're doing.

Outside cats do suck. I don\u2019t hear whippoorwill\u2019s where I live anymore, because they are ground nesting, so adding cats to the mix of raccoons, foxes, coyotes and snakes is too much.

My pound won't even take cats anymore as they are overrun with cats.\n\nI would look into deterrence. they make ones for cats that I hear work.", "NTA. If this were a dog doing the same thing that a cat was doing, people would be saying it was neglected, find it a home etc. There is a double standard with dogs and cats, but they are both companion animals that are not meant to be outside unattended. It is not safe for the cat, nor is it good for the ecosystem as cats kill birds daily when outside which throws the ecosystem out of balance. If it that important that their cat be outside, they can build it a catio.", "Yta sadly this is an outdoor cat, and while i disagree with cats being outside, it is what it is. \n\nTaking the cat to the pound has a good chance of the cat ending up dead.

It's a toughy.\n\nUltimately though, YTA.\n\nShould cats be indoors and not outdoors due to the effect they have on local wildlife? For sure! Should you be essentially imprisoning their cat every time it comes on your property and into the trap? Absolutely not. Unless it's attacking your pets and/or yourselves, there's no reason to do this. \n\nAlso IANAL, but I'm pretty sure if that cat gets injured or sick in ANY WAY during this process, guess who's liable? You. You may be setting yourself up for legal troubles if something happens to that cat. Yes, it's on your property and it's \"trespassing\" but unless your have local laws that prohibit such things, you have no right to do this. The cat is not a wild animal. \n\nGet into a car accident while transporting the cat and it breaks a bone or dies? I hope you're willing to let your wallet die on this hill. I say this because it sounds like this is going to keep happening frequently and it's going to be a lot of trips to the pound until the owners take legal action or you get bored.", "YTA. Yeah, you are, it's not what you're saying, but how you're attacking and addressing her. I've never heard of leash laws for cats, but I have heard of cat curfews. I agree cats should be kept indoors, but I think you could have handled this a lot better.", "ESH - you for planning to leave out the trap and take the cat to a shelter (and using shelter resources when every one is over crowded).\n\nThem for allowing their cat to roam outside.\n\nDo some Google research on how to deter wildlife from your yard - motion air cans, motion sprinklers, etc.\n\nAlso, reconsider the feeder as there's a global bird flu pandemic that is devastating the bird population.", "YTA for how you handled the situation. You're new to the area, and instead of talking nicely with the neighbor, you were rude - I would have had the same reaction as the neighbor.  Now the neighborhood has labeled you as \"That\" neighbor.  So don't expect people to be welcoming, and they can make your life difficult. \n\nIf you live in a rural/suburban area, expect to see cats and wildlife roaming around, and yeah, they kill birds too.  \n\nSearch for sprays to keep cats off your property instead of antagonizing the neighbors.", "YTA - your cat needs to be retrained on how to exist and maintain domain over their own space regardless of what is going on outside.\n\nWatch any episode of \"My Cat From Hell\"", "Just a question.  And I don't mean to be judgemental, only to understand the thought process. \n\n\nYou buy a house in a wooded area.\nThat means wild  critters and animals will roam around.\n\nNow let's say there was no cat involved (your neighbour has no pet, or a dog, or whatever) but rather a local wild predator?\nWhat would you do? \nKill /trap it because it bothers you? \n\n\nWhat was the thought process ? Trap every weasel, fox, badger, snake  whatever the local predatory  fauna is  every time? Just so that you can do lazy bird watching? \n\nNot only that, but by putting a feeding station for birds in a more rural area  you basically told every bird predator around \" hey, lurking here will get you more prey\"\n\nSo why you get angry when an animal gets on your (only recently) property and do what animals do? especially since they were there before you were and probably stalked those grounds before your purchase?", "[deleted]", "Well, your dream home is now standing in hell. Was it worth it? I agree cats should be kept indoors (my 4 cats are indoor cats) but you just turned the whole neighbourhood against you with that attitude. You could've talked to them before taking their cat and you certainly don't go around threatening to steal more cats if you can. The way you handled this, you can be sure no one will listen to your well meant advice about leashes and indoor cats (also, that's not meeting anyone halfway, that's imposing your way).\n\nIf it is indeed illegal to have cats roam free where you live, you can notify the authorities, but be prepared to have a bad time living there.

Anyone who lets their pet cat roam the neighborhood where it can kill off native wildlife or get injured is definitely TA.", "Honestly I don\u2019t mind my cat howling, that\u2019s his prerogative. It\u2019s the bird killing getting to me.", "This! \u2b06\ufe0f  this is done in my area.  These cats make wonderful barn cats, keeping the rodent population down.", "How would the person know the cat is chipped?  They don\u2019t have a chip reader.", "> If you park your car where it doesnt belong it gets towed.\n\nBy the city, who has legal authority to tow your car. OP isn't the city, and if OP randomly towed someone's car because it was parked illegally, that would still be auto-theft.", "I don\u2019t hear him complaining about the birds roaming freely on his property so yes it does matter what kind of animal we\u2019re taking about.", "Oh yes, every lawmaker wastes time doing this /s", "Dogs can injure and even kill a man. They are not the same.", "Country and county and two different things. OP mentioned that her county had a \u201cleash law\u201dstating cats must be on a leash if outside. This is common in the US. I think you need to reread the post. I am very familiar with what a blue Jay is.", "I agree, she *shouldn't* have to. Sadly, this is reality and not 'perfect, ideal world land'.", "Well the type of bird speaks to where in the world OP is talking about.  However, OP has corrected, it is county not country.", "Animal Control is law enforcement. Law enforcement cannot come into your home without a warrant or your permission. If Animal Control is called on you and you\u2019re worried that they may take your pets \u2013 you have the right to not let them in. Anything they can see in \u201cplain sight\u201d can be probable cause for a warrant.", "i just think its funny you bought a house and are going to live there 30 years and the first thing you did was threaten a neighbor and make everyone hate you.   \n\n\nwhat an absolutely stupid move", "Just using OPs words \"in my country\"", "Well no. If you park on private property the owner of the property can have your car towed.", "Are these pet birds? \n\nIf someones parrot was flying into my hard and talking my ear off I\u2019d def have a few things to say about it.", "Actually yes. Every city has in their codes what animals are permissible within the city limits and how those animals may be kept. Source: am a city government employee.", "I was asking you, not a lawmaker. You said theyre different so you think cats are allowed on other people\u2019s property but dogs arent. Why the distinction and does it apply to all pets?", "Yup, and dogs are meant to be kept on ones own property. And cats are invasive and are killing other animals and should remain on your own property.", "I've never heard of a cat leash  law. Dogs, yes. \n  It differs by county and city as well.", "OP corrected this after I read the original post.", "So the commenter was confusing the two words. Okay.\n\nedited for word.", "Right? OP thinks this is about the cat and the cat owner neighbor. Word has already spread.....", "Sorry I thought I said county, not country. I will edit!", "Well your city does.", "Animals kill other animals. You can't change nature.", "Well, I stand corrected, thank you", "Domesticated pets beg to differ.\n\nWe literally turned a wolf into a pug.", "That's called selective breeding. Quite a difference. I don't see any snub nose cats walking around"]}
