{"id": 21416, "submission_id": "14rdlwh", "title": "AITA for threatening to take my neighbors cat to the pound?", "selftext": "Just over a week ago my husband & I purchased our dream home in a small, wooded neighborhood. The first night we woke up to our cat screaming at the window, tail fluffed up \u2014 there was another cat outside. A few days later, I noticed birds were no longer coming to the feeder I set up. On investigation, I found a gorgeous blue jay dead a few feet away, feathers strewn about. \n\nObviously thinking this was a stray cat situation, I set up a humane trap. It took less than a day to catch her and take her to the vet. Our vet said she was already spayed, and had a chip linking her to our next-door neighbors house. Perfect \u2014 I take the (presumably) lost cat to return her home to her relieved owners. \n\nThey were not relieved. Evidently Sadie is an indoor/outdoor cat. I explained that she had killed a bird in my backyard, and that our house already has bug issues, so decaying carcasses are going to make that worse, and requested that they please keep her on a leash while outside. (Which is the law in our county anyway, but I didn\u2019t want to be hostile so I didn\u2019t mention it). She said I couldn\u2019t prove it was her cat who killed the bird, and called me ridiculous for the leash idea (despite the fact that I explained my cat goes out on a leash just fine). \n\nI asked her to please keep her cat indoors if she is unable to keep her off our property. No dice. So I elaborated, saying that I will continue leaving out the humane trap on our porch, and she can pick up her cat at the pound when she wanders in again. \n\nShe told me to F off and shut the door in my face.\n\nThis was not called for as she was being super hostile the entire conversation and I was the only one trying to meet her halfway and come up with solutions (leash, keep her inside). \n\nMy husband & friends think she was totally out of line.  But, while we were on a walk this morning another neighbor approached asking if we were the a-holes who just moved in. We turned around and walked back home but I assume it was because word got around about the cat situation. \n\nSo\u2014 am I the asshole for wanting to keep a predator from killing wildlife on my property?\n\nEDIT it looks like a pretty even ESH/YTA/NTA split which of surprising. To address a common question, I live in a suburb about 15 miles out of the states capital. It has a 50/50 suburban/rural atmosphere (lots of trees & older ranch homes mixed with higher-end treeless HOA neighborhoods; I live in an older ranch). It\u2019s about half a mile away from my previous home so I\u2019m familiar with the area. \n\nEDIT 2 it appears there is a lot of confusion about the pound \u2014 my intention was never to have the kitty put down, only for her to have to pick her up and learn her lesson. I see now that it\u2019s an easy mistake to make, and of course if someone insinuated they were going to put down my cat of course I\u2019d be upset!! I\u2019m going to do what a commenter suggested \u2014 buy one of those rainbow collars that warn birds for her, bring her cookies & apologize for the miscommunication.", "created_utc": 1688570246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rdlwh/aita_for_threatening_to_take_my_neighbors_cat_to/", "score": 2013, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cats are an invasive species and shouldn't be left to wander around the neighborhood unchecked, however, threatening to give her cat to the pound is definitely too far. A lot of people don't even know about how bad cats are for the ecosystem when they're allowed to free-roam and kill anything they want, and you approached her in an unreasonably hostile way. However, if it is the law in your county to have cats on leashes then she should be following that. But the way you approached the situation was unnecessarily hostile and unkind. A lot of people aren't educated on why outdoor cats are bad for ecosystems and approaching her in an unkind manner certainly isn't going to want to make her consider the effects of letting her cat outdoors.", "ESH. I personally fully agree with you that it\u2019s irresponsible to have \u2018outdoor cats\u2019. It\u2019s bad for the environment, disrespectful to your neighbors and unsafe for the cat.\n\nThat said, in some areas, especially rural ones, outdoor cats are very much baked into the culture. It sounds as if you are new to this community and didn\u2019t really bother to get to know your neighbors or ask questions about local norms before you went in imposing your personal values on everyone else. And honestly, not every battle is worth fighting\u2014 if you live in an area where lots of people have outdoor cats, are you going to spend the rest of your life in a miserable feud, dropping cats off at the pound left and right? It might be better to have peace with your neighbors and the annoyances of outdoor cats.\n\nIt\u2019s also not cool to waste your local animal shelter\u2019s resources when you know full well where this cat belongs.", "ESH\n\n\nI get your logic for trapping it the first time, but you can\u2019t threaten to steal other people\u2019s pets.  \n\nYour neighbor is an AH for telling you to F off and apparently gossiping to other neighbors.", "NTA. Cats are inside animals and anything less is abuse. Doesn't matter the local culture, they can learn.", "NTA\n\nGo ahead and tell her it's illegal in your county. The humane trap seems reasonable since she won't cooperate. And the other neighbor is an AH. \n\nBut it's someone's beloved cat. Maybe don't use the word predator  -- you're not wrong technically, but it's not how you gain cooperation from others. Just say you want to protect the birds on your property.", "NTA. You did what you could; outdoor cats are inherently dangerous to both the cat and the surrounding wildlife. If they can't keep their cat inside (and safe), they really shouldn't have a cat at all.", "YTA if you just take the cat to the pound. You can be pissed but what you can't do is steal someone's pet because you don't like what they're doing. Having their pet stolen is not the prescribed punishment for violating pet-related laws/ordinances. Call the county if you have a pet problem.", "YTA, because you actually can't prove it was their cat killing the bird and because your bug problem is not your neighbours problem. \n\nThat said where I'm from cats can and do and are legally within their rights to roam freely and everyone would think keeping it on a lead is ridiculous (you ever tried walking a cat?)\n\nYou can get noise deterrents which the cats can hear but you can't to protect the birds btw", "Just a warning, do as you please, but this will be the thing the neighborhood knows you by if this is the first thing you do when you move to a new house. \n\nCats aren\u2019t supposed to be outside like that, but choose your battles", "NTA.  You were actually rather nice to let the owners know the cat was going places it shouldn't.

Outside cats do suck. I don\u2019t hear whippoorwill\u2019s where I live anymore, because they are ground nesting, so adding cats to the mix of raccoons, foxes, coyotes and snakes is too much.

Animals will animal, especially if you live in a \"wooded neighborhood\". Leashing a cat outdoors is a ridiculous idea IMHO.

You might also be an AH if you take the cat as you really dont get to pet-nap other people\u2019s pets.", "ESH\n\nOutdoor cats are a pain in the ass. \nBut you can't steal the cat whenever you get annoyed and drop it off at the pound. My pound won't even take cats anymore as they are overrun with cats.\n\nI would look into deterrence. they make ones for cats that I hear work.", "NTA. If this were a dog doing the same thing that a cat was doing, people would be saying it was neglected, find it a home etc. There is a double standard with dogs and cats, but they are both companion animals that are not meant to be outside unattended. It is not safe for the cat, nor is it good for the ecosystem as cats kill birds daily when outside which throws the ecosystem out of balance. If it that important that their cat be outside, they can build it a catio.", "Yta sadly this is an outdoor cat, and while i disagree with cats being outside, it is what it is. \n\nTaking the cat to the pound has a good chance of the cat ending up dead.  You'd be punishing the cat for being a cat.\n\nSet up anti cat things on your property. Motion senser sprinklers, cat proof fencing, motion sensor air blower, etc.\n\nHonestly, I'm kinda impressed kitty took out a jay. They are mean, nasty birds.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour neighbors need to learn how to look after a pet and take responsibility for it. If a pet continuously misbehaves, attacks things and kills them, then they need to be put down. It's sad because its not the pets fault, its the owners for being an A-hole and not teaching the pet right from wrong.", "YTA - You buy a home in a rural area and in two days are trying to tell the neighbors that their cat shouldn't be killing bluebirds. And threatening to steal the cat if they let their cat be a cat.\n\nAnd yes, YTA for trying to change the nature of a predator.", "I'm in the UK and here cats have a legal right to roam (and unfortunately kill). But if it's illegal in your country then definitely NTA.", "YTA, YOU CANNOT ASK FOR AN OWNER TO LOCK HIS CAT, just spray water or make loud noises to scare the cat and he won\u2019t be coming anymore, cats are scared easily", "I've been siting here for awhile trying to judge this one. It's a toughy.\n\nUltimately though, YTA.\n\nShould cats be indoors and not outdoors due to the effect they have on local wildlife? For sure! Should you be essentially imprisoning their cat every time it comes on your property and into the trap? Absolutely not. Unless it's attacking your pets and/or yourselves, there's no reason to do this. \n\nAlso IANAL, but I'm pretty sure if that cat gets injured or sick in ANY WAY during this process, guess who's liable? You. You may be setting yourself up for legal troubles if something happens to that cat. Yes, it's on your property and it's \"trespassing\" but unless your have local laws that prohibit such things, you have no right to do this. The cat is not a wild animal. \n\nGet into a car accident while transporting the cat and it breaks a bone or dies? I hope you're willing to let your wallet die on this hill. I say this because it sounds like this is going to keep happening frequently and it's going to be a lot of trips to the pound until the owners take legal action or you get bored.", "YTA. Yeah, you are, it's not what you're saying, but how you're attacking and addressing her. I've never heard of leash laws for cats, but I have heard of cat curfews. I agree cats should be kept indoors, but I think you could have handled this a lot better.", "ESH - you for planning to leave out the trap and take the cat to a shelter (and using shelter resources when every one is over crowded).\n\nThem for allowing their cat to roam outside.\n\nDo some Google research on how to deter wildlife from your yard - motion air cans, motion sprinklers, etc.\n\nAlso, reconsider the feeder as there's a global bird flu pandemic that is devastating the bird population.", "YTA for how you handled the situation. You're new to the area, and instead of talking nicely with the neighbor, you were rude - I would have had the same reaction as the neighbor.  Now the neighborhood has labeled you as \"That\" neighbor.  So don't expect people to be welcoming, and they can make your life difficult. \n\nIf you live in a rural/suburban area, expect to see cats and wildlife roaming around, and yeah, they kill birds too.  \n\nSearch for sprays to keep cats off your property instead of antagonizing the neighbors.", "YTA - your cat needs to be retrained on how to exist and maintain domain over their own space regardless of what is going on outside.\n\nWatch any episode of \"My Cat From Hell\"", "Just a question.  And I don't mean to be judgemental, only to understand the thought process. \n\n\nYou buy a house in a wooded area.\nThat means wild  critters and animals will roam around.\n\nNow let's say there was no cat involved (your neighbour has no pet, or a dog, or whatever) but rather a local wild predator?\nWhat would you do? \nKill /trap it because it bothers you? \n\n\nWhat was the thought process ? Trap every weasel, fox, badger, snake  whatever the local predatory  fauna is  every time? Just so that you can do lazy bird watching? \n\nNot only that, but by putting a feeding station for birds in a more rural area  you basically told every bird predator around \" hey, lurking here will get you more prey\"\n\nSo why you get angry when an animal gets on your (only recently) property and do what animals do? especially since they were there before you were and probably stalked those grounds before your purchase?", "[deleted]", "Well, your dream home is now standing in hell. Was it worth it? I agree cats should be kept indoors (my 4 cats are indoor cats) but you just turned the whole neighbourhood against you with that attitude. You could've talked to them before taking their cat and you certainly don't go around threatening to steal more cats if you can. The way you handled this, you can be sure no one will listen to your well meant advice about leashes and indoor cats (also, that's not meeting anyone halfway, that's imposing your way).\n\nIf it is indeed illegal to have cats roam free where you live, you can notify the authorities, but be prepared to have a bad time living there.

It can't be about dogs being able to kill a man, because even dogs like chihuahuas, yorkies, pugs, and other dogs even smaller than some cats couldn't do that, yet must also be on a leash.\n\n>Or by the fact that you capture non dangerous critters because you don't like them on your lawn ( I would understand the dangerous ones, especially if you have animals or children around but the rest? )\n\nFirstly, where did I specify 'non-dangerous' critters or that I was doing it because I didn't like them on my lawn? I specifically said shooting certain ones who were or could kill my chickens. For snakes I also said 'IF' that snake was a menace (non-venemous snakes can still eat chicks and eggs and cause problems with pets). \n\nAs for weasels, badgers, and possums they can also be dangerous. The possum is the least dangerous, but that doesn't mean its safe to just have wandering around your yard...for it or the pets/kids it might encounter. Hell, I've chased deer and rabbits off my property for eating my plants or getting into the vegetable patch. Not only because they're damaging my property, but because they are a danger to people and dogs (deer can be surprisingly aggressive esp during rut) and they are *in danger* themselves (lots of dogs, even really small ones, will go after wild animals that can and will tear them apart. My grandmother's Pomeranian literally got eviscerated by a raccoon...and the dog started the fight). It's not about not liking them touching 'my' grass or whatever.\n\n>It's not like the lady owns the wild birds.\n\nNo, she doesn't. But she *does* own the property. And she has the right to have and enjoy that property in any legal way she sees fit without having the neighbor's lawbreaking impacting that enjoyment. The neighbors can't blast their music at ungodly volumes night and day to impact her enjoyment of her property, they can't let their dogs or kids run loose on her property, they can't decide to set off fireworks illegally on her property, or encroach to cut down her trees, or build a swimming pool on her property, right? So why can they let their cat run loose on her property and SHE has to suck it up instead of them just, you know, being a good neighbor and being responsible for their animal?\n\nI mean, everyone is saying how she's a bad neighbor and shouldn't have moved there if she's not willing to have this other person's pet on her property (for ANY reason), but no one is pointing out that her neighbor is being a bad neighbor for letting his pet run roughshod over her property and investment because *they* can't be bothered being responsible. They'd be a bad neighbor if their kids were doing it. They'd be a bad neighbor if they were blasting music or cutting down their trees or if it was a dog they were letting do it. Why aren't they a bad neighbor just because its a cat? The law and their responsibility toward their pet and their neighbors doesn't change because 'it's a cat'. THEY are the ones not being courteous, responsible, good neighbors, not OP.\n\n>This is more akin to the neighbour dog shitting on your lawn.\n\nNo, it isn't. This is akin to the neighbor dog wandering into your lawn whenever it wants to, shitting there, digging holes, knocking down the bird feeder and going after the birds (dogs hunt and catch birds too), etc. and your neighbor saying 'too bad, I let him roam around wherever he wants. I don't care that there's a leash law or that he's damaging your property or your enjoyment of it'. \n\n>I would still not trap the dog, nor call the police.\n\nI absolutely would, and have, if someone was letting their dog wander around and do this on my property. Heck, legally, with my livestock, I can just outright *shoot the dog* for being on my property, even if it has a collar and tag on. I wouldn't unless the dog was actually proving itself to be a menace to my animals and even then I'd probably try everything else possible first because I love dogs and don't ever want to shoot one, but legally I could. And I would if it came down to it, because MY pets and animals are MY responsibility and that means keeping them safe from someone else's pet. Why is it suddenly absurd to do the same thing because someone is letting their cat wander around and do all the same things instead? Whose fault is it if that dog dies? Mine for saving the life of MY animal from that dog...or the owner of that dog who didn't want to bother being a responsible pet owner and thought everyone around them should just let their dog wander on their property and do whatever they want?\n\nIf I managed to catch the dog instead of shooting it and took it to the shelter, am I stealing it? Or am I taking it to the legally appropriate place where I can be sure its not only safe from being shot by the next landowner or hit by a car, but also so I can be sure MY pets/children are safe in their own yard and home?\n\nI guarantee if that cat is coming onto OPs property to catch birds, it's also digging holes, shitting and pissing everywhere. May even be spraying to mark its territory and cat spray not only stinks horribly it IS a hazard. \n\n>And I am pretty sure that capturing someone's pet ( irregardless of the reason) is theft\n\nIt's not. Taking a cat or a dog that is a stray (even if it has a home, if its wandering around off leash or unsupervised, it's by definition a stray) to a shelter is not theft. Hell, if one of my indoor only cats got out and my neighbor caught it and took it to a shelter, I'd be OVER THE MOON happy about it. Because now I can get my cat back and not have to worry about them being lost, hurt, suffering, or dead somewhere. I would be thanking that person, possibly even rewarding them...not accusing them of theft. \n\n>And the fact that the neighbour did the nono first doesn't allows you to do a nono yourself.\n\nTaking a stray to the shelter out of concern for its safety and/or the safety of your property/pets/children is not a nono. Its literally what you should do when you see a stray.

Yes.\nBut seriously all you americans thinking that a cat being outdoor is bad for itself? It's fucking deranged", "Soo many strays/ferals back home and they're mostly all really friendly. Most of our pets were strays that my mom took in. Didn't need to be socialized at all. Pretty much just opened the door and they walked right in.", "What i learned today. The US is absolutly ridiculous about there Properties....", "I swear to Allah on high this is the most ridiculous thing I've seen today.", "Still stress on the animal and taking resources away, also would they fine the owner? I feel like a fine would be for the woman using their services to retaliate against her neighbour.", "I feel like it all depends in the cat. One of our colony cats had to have her leg amputated and now she lives with us. She absolutely loves people. We have had people over for the first time and she just goes into love mode.

My parents had a cat that hated any humans, never came inside and they had to leave the food and walk away. It was not feral, just crazy", "I know SO many people who have indoor/outdoor cats and put them out purely because they don't want to deal with entertaining their cats. Throwing them outside is an easy, lazy solution if you don't want to actually... you know... provide all your cats needs. Especially nowadays when leashes, catios and those cat tents are getting cheaper and more accessible, there's a lot of alternatives to just letting a cat roam free.", "No, it doesn't. You towing the car yourself or catching the cat = stealing.\n\nYou calling the towing company or animal control = not stealing.", "Modern house cats actually originate from the Fertile Crescent area. They were introduced by the British during colonization to kill mice, and since then have killed billions of birds and caused over 33 animal extinctions.\nPlus there have been studies done using cat cams that show that cats kill more animals than the ones they bring to their humans, by a long shot.
