The first night we woke up to our cat screaming at the window, tail fluffed up \u2014 there was another cat outside. A few days later, I noticed birds were no longer coming to the feeder I set up. On investigation, I found a gorgeous blue jay dead a few feet away, feathers strewn about. \n\nObviously thinking this was a stray cat situation, I set up a humane trap. It took less than a day to catch her and take her to the vet. Our vet said she was already spayed, and had a chip linking her to our next-door neighbors house. Perfect \u2014 I take the (presumably) lost cat to return her home to her relieved owners. \n\nThey were not relieved. Evidently Sadie is an indoor/outdoor cat. I explained that she had killed a bird in my backyard, and that our house already has bug issues, so decaying carcasses are going to make that worse, and requested that they please keep her on a leash while outside. (Which is the law in our county anyway, but I didn\u2019t want to be hostile so I didn\u2019t mention it). She said I couldn\u2019t prove it was her cat who killed the bird, and called me ridiculous for the leash idea (despite the fact that I explained my cat goes out on a leash just fine). \n\nI asked her to please keep her cat indoors if she is unable to keep her off our property. No dice. So I elaborated, saying that I will continue leaving out the humane trap on our porch, and she can pick up her cat at the pound when she wanders in again. \n\nShe told me to F off and shut the door in my face.\n\nThis was not called for as she was being super hostile the entire conversation and I was the only one trying to meet her halfway and come up with solutions (leash, keep her inside). \n\nMy husband & friends think she was totally out of line.  But, while we were on a walk this morning another neighbor approached asking if we were the a-holes who just moved in. We turned around and walked back home but I assume it was because word got around about the cat situation. \n\nSo\u2014 am I the asshole for wanting to keep a predator from killing wildlife on my property?\n\nEDIT it looks like a pretty even ESH/YTA/NTA split which of surprising. To address a common question, I live in a suburb about 15 miles out of the states capital. It has a 50/50 suburban/rural atmosphere (lots of trees & older ranch homes mixed with higher-end treeless HOA neighborhoods; I live in an older ranch). It\u2019s about half a mile away from my previous home so I\u2019m familiar with the area.", "created_utc": 1688570246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rdlwh/aita_for_threatening_to_take_my_neighbors_cat_to/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cats are an invasive species and shouldn't be left to wander around the neighborhood unchecked, however, threatening to give her cat to the pound is definitely too far. A lot of people don't even know about how bad cats are for the ecosystem when they're allowed to free-roam and kill anything they want, and you approached her in an unreasonably hostile way. However, if it is the law in your county to have cats on leashes then she should be following that. But the way you approached the situation was unnecessarily hostile and unkind. A lot of people aren't educated on why outdoor cats are bad for ecosystems and approaching her in an unkind manner certainly isn't going to want to make her consider the effects of letting her cat outdoors.", "ESH. I personally fully agree with you that it\u2019s irresponsible to have \u2018outdoor cats\u2019. It\u2019s bad for the environment, disrespectful to your neighbors and unsafe for the cat.\n\nThat said, in some areas, especially rural ones, outdoor cats are very much baked into the culture. It sounds as if you are new to this community and didn\u2019t really bother to get to know your neighbors or ask questions about local norms before you went in imposing your personal values on everyone else. And honestly, not every battle is worth fighting\u2014 if you live in an area where lots of people have outdoor cats, are you going to spend the rest of your life in a miserable feud, dropping cats off at the pound left and right? It might be better to have peace with your neighbors and the annoyances of outdoor cats.\n\nIt\u2019s also not cool to waste your local animal shelter\u2019s resources when you know full well where this cat belongs.", "ESH\n\n\nI get your logic for trapping it the first time, but you can\u2019t threaten to steal other people\u2019s pets.  \n\nYour neighbor is an AH for telling you to F off and apparently gossiping to other neighbors.", "NTA.

The humane trap seems reasonable since she won't cooperate. And the other neighbor is an AH. \n\nBut it's someone's beloved cat. Maybe don't use the word predator  -- you're not wrong technically, but it's not how you gain cooperation from others. Just say you want to protect the birds on your property.", "NTA. You did what you could; outdoor cats are inherently dangerous to both the cat and the surrounding wildlife. If they can't keep their cat inside (and safe), they really shouldn't have a cat at all.", "YTA if you just take the cat to the pound. You can be pissed but what you can't do is steal someone's pet because you don't like what they're doing.

Outside cats do suck. I don\u2019t hear whippoorwill\u2019s where I live anymore, because they are ground nesting, so adding cats to the mix of raccoons, foxes, coyotes and snakes is too much.

You might also be an AH if you take the cat as you really dont get to pet-nap other people\u2019s pets.", "ESH\n\nOutdoor cats are a pain in the ass. \nBut you can't steal the cat whenever you get annoyed and drop it off at the pound. My pound won't even take cats anymore as they are overrun with cats.\n\nI would look into deterrence. they make ones for cats that I hear work.", "NTA. If this were a dog doing the same thing that a cat was doing, people would be saying it was neglected, find it a home etc. There is a double standard with dogs and cats, but they are both companion animals that are not meant to be outside unattended. It is not safe for the cat, nor is it good for the ecosystem as cats kill birds daily when outside which throws the ecosystem out of balance. If it that important that their cat be outside, they can build it a catio.", "Yta sadly this is an outdoor cat, and while i disagree with cats being outside, it is what it is. \n\nTaking the cat to the pound has a good chance of the cat ending up dead.

They are mean, nasty birds.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour neighbors need to learn how to look after a pet and take responsibility for it. If a pet continuously misbehaves, attacks things and kills them, then they need to be put down.

It's a toughy.\n\nUltimately though, YTA.\n\nShould cats be indoors and not outdoors due to the effect they have on local wildlife? For sure! Should you be essentially imprisoning their cat every time it comes on your property and into the trap? Absolutely not. Unless it's attacking your pets and/or yourselves, there's no reason to do this. \n\nAlso IANAL, but I'm pretty sure if that cat gets injured or sick in ANY WAY during this process, guess who's liable? You. You may be setting yourself up for legal troubles if something happens to that cat. Yes, it's on your property and it's \"trespassing\" but unless your have local laws that prohibit such things, you have no right to do this. The cat is not a wild animal. \n\nGet into a car accident while transporting the cat and it breaks a bone or dies? I hope you're willing to let your wallet die on this hill. I say this because it sounds like this is going to keep happening frequently and it's going to be a lot of trips to the pound until the owners take legal action or you get bored.", "YTA. Yeah, you are, it's not what you're saying, but how you're attacking and addressing her. I've never heard of leash laws for cats, but I have heard of cat curfews. I agree cats should be kept indoors, but I think you could have handled this a lot better.", "ESH - you for planning to leave out the trap and take the cat to a shelter (and using shelter resources when every one is over crowded).\n\nThem for allowing their cat to roam outside.\n\nDo some Google research on how to deter wildlife from your yard - motion air cans, motion sprinklers, etc.\n\nAlso, reconsider the feeder as there's a global bird flu pandemic that is devastating the bird population.", "YTA for how you handled the situation. You're new to the area, and instead of talking nicely with the neighbor, you were rude - I would have had the same reaction as the neighbor.  Now the neighborhood has labeled you as \"That\" neighbor.  So don't expect people to be welcoming, and they can make your life difficult. \n\nIf you live in a rural/suburban area, expect to see cats and wildlife roaming around, and yeah, they kill birds too.  \n\nSearch for sprays to keep cats off your property instead of antagonizing the neighbors.", "YTA - your cat needs to be retrained on how to exist and maintain domain over their own space regardless of what is going on outside.\n\nWatch any episode of \"My Cat From Hell\"", "Just a question.  And I don't mean to be judgemental, only to understand the thought process. \n\n\nYou buy a house in a wooded area.\nThat means wild  critters and animals will roam around.\n\nNow let's say there was no cat involved (your neighbour has no pet, or a dog, or whatever) but rather a local wild predator?\nWhat would you do? \nKill /trap it because it bothers you? \n\n\nWhat was the thought process ? Trap every weasel, fox, badger, snake  whatever the local predatory  fauna is  every time? Just so that you can do lazy bird watching? \n\nNot only that, but by putting a feeding station for birds in a more rural area  you basically told every bird predator around \" hey, lurking here will get you more prey\"\n\nSo why you get angry when an animal gets on your (only recently) property and do what animals do? especially since they were there before you were and probably stalked those grounds before your purchase?", "[deleted]", "Well, your dream home is now standing in hell. Was it worth it? I agree cats should be kept indoors (my 4 cats are indoor cats) but you just turned the whole neighbourhood against you with that attitude. You could've talked to them before taking their cat and you certainly don't go around threatening to steal more cats if you can. The way you handled this, you can be sure no one will listen to your well meant advice about leashes and indoor cats (also, that's not meeting anyone halfway, that's imposing your way).\n\nIf it is indeed illegal to have cats roam free where you live, you can notify the authorities, but be prepared to have a bad time living there.

They were destroyed by HUMANS because they were \u2018bad for crops\u2019.", "Dude it killing a single bird won\u2019t make your problems worse, small birds die all the time", "But why? If your concern is wildlife?", "This indoor cat thing is a new idea. You think when we domesticated them 9000 years ago, we kept them inside? No, they've mostly been wandering around as they please.", "I don't know what part of the US you're from, but here in the South, we have cats that ARE domesticated. So pawn that BS off somewhere else.", "Yes, cats, peacocks, and Guinea fowl.", "Nope. That's nature.", "No, OP even stated that in their country, outdoor cats must be on a leash.", "What do you mean, it\u2019s spelled right?", "The owner has legal authority to remove the cat from its property.

Peacocks and guinea fowl are actually not allowed to free roam on other people's property. When I first moved into this place, a flock of peafowl and guineas owned by a gentleman up the street were wandering free in our neighborhood, causing quite a lot of nuisance and damage. The owner got a hefty fine and even court time.\n\nNo one's pets or livestock are 'permissible' to free roam on other people's property without their permission.", "Ugh Guineas - my mom had a few of them years ago and would let them out during the day, and they actually stayed on our property, but they were so noisy (we live in the country so it didn't bother anyone ME lol) but they were good for bug/pest control.
