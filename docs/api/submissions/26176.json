SIL is my husband's sister. Fran and I are close. She and I have become like sisters in the years I have been married to my husband. When Fran was pregnant with her son, she and her husband disagreed on baby names. He wanted something cool and unusual and she wanted their son to have a normal name. When baby was born they agreed to the compromise of a normal name and an unusual middle name. Fran wasn't super fond of the middle name. But felt like she'd have to compromise since her husband didn't really love the first name. For the sake of the post we'll say his name is Thomas Wave.\n\nAfter the birth of their son, Fran ended up pregnant again and suffered a very traumatic miscarriage that put her life in danger and resulted in her being unable to conceive again. She was, understandably, devastated and left very fragile afterward. But she never sought therapy and there is a grief there that she has carried with her for many years. She grieves for the baby she lost and also for the end to her ability to have more children. She wanted three kids prior to this. She decided to enjoy having a child because she said she was lucky to have one and some can't have any.\n\nWhen my nephew started school he told friends his middle name and they started calling him that and slowly over the last decade he has been using Wave more as his name instead of Thomas. He told his parents he no longer wanted to be Thomas and was instead going to be Wave and that everyone outside of family uses it now, including teachers and friends. They were aware people called him Wave but Fran thought it was more like giving it to him as a nickname.\n\nShe was upset he decided to go by Wave over Thomas. My ILs found it ridiculous and said all she needed to do was refuse to call him Wave and tell him that he needs a real name and not something made up and as his mother she should have that right to call him by his legal name. Fran came to me to vent and talk about it where her son wouldn't hear and be upset. She said it broke her heart to have him reject the name she had chosen for him and to know she had never liked the name he has chosen to use in his everyday life. She felt like a bad mom and a failure and even though it was dumb she was heartbroken (her words). She told me she couldn't understand why she felt so bad. I gently suggested that it might not be so much about the name, but some unprocessed grief over her miscarriage and inability to have more children and the fact her only child didn't like the name she had chosen. I said even if it is the name therapy could be helpful. She agreed with me and said she owed it to her son at the very least.\n\nMy ILs are not happy I suggested her to attend therapy. They said this is over a dumb name their son in-law gave their grandson as a middle name and Fran needs to take her advice and things will be fine. They said I was blowing things way out of proportion and acting like she had no right to be upset.

It will just start fights with the son and the husband and ultimately won't change anything. The kid will still use the name he prefers, everyone will feel disrespected and your SIL will still feel rejected. Therapy will help her get closure and deal with reality the *way it is.*", ">For the sake of the post we'll say his name is Thomas Wave.\n\nI mean, I'm not exactly the biggest fan of \"unusual names\" when it comes to some I've seen, but it reaaaally depends. How a name sounds is subjective, so even an unusual name can be a badge of honor of sorts due to the kid playing it off completely cool and even embracing it, allowing them to skirt by the shittier of kids by having a group of people at their back who know them by it without issue.\n\n>My ILs found it ridiculous and said all she needed to do was refuse to call him Wave and tell him that he needs a real name and not something made up and as his mother she should have that right to call him by his legal name.\n\nYeah, good luck with that. This isn't the 1950s anymore, and the limits of a parents ability to command their rapidly maturing child is one constantly losing ground. She can say she won't, and it'll hurt her relationship with Wave, but she can't command he go by a different name when the he's going by is also his legitimately given name.\n\nThis also makes it look like she's letting her grief stop her from adapting to her sons growth and change as a person.\n\n>My ILs are not happy I suggested her to attend therapy.

I think in away she needs to tell her son away from the rest of the family what she said to you.  Her son doesn't really know what he means to your sister and he probably doesn't know about his mums situation and why this is upsetting to her.  It needs to be done maybe with a counsellor/mediator.  But a name is about identity and the son is at a time when he is finding his and maybe he just feels more himself using his middle name.  but perhaps he could continue to use his first name just with his mum when he understands how she feels. It could be something special between them.  I know three of my aunts had two names they all had names that was their birth name, which was used professionally and a different name used by family and friends.  Also the royal family (am british) have many names.  I unfortunately dont have any kids but I always thought it would be great to give them a few names and let them choose later which they preferred.  My ideal would have been to use one name say Luke and then use the letters to form the other names ie liam, uther, karl and elijah. ok those werent the actual names lol but just the concept.  The thing is ultimately what name the son uses is going to be up to him.  But I totally get why the mother is upset, she carried her son for 9 months and he is her only child, and she had to compromise on the name, fair enough sort of because both parents obviously didn't like the other name at all really.  the thing is the boy has to live with the names now.  But you are not the baddie here in anyway because you are doing what is right you are supporting and loving your friend, when she needs it.  and you are trying your best to help her.

I hope Fran goes to therapy.", "And how awesome is it that Fran was not only aware of how her feelings were probably not coming from the right place, but was also willing to go to therapy to help her find the root cause and address them so they wouldn't cause an issue with her son. Too many times ppl with her issue refuse to put in the work to adjust and just go the in-law route of forcing their way, so it's really great that this time we see a great mom.", "Also, he's 15! He can make his own decisions about what he wants to be called! Soon he'll be an adult and parents and ILs won't be able to do squat", "Why are the in-laws being haters against their grandson's personality? Is it that they hate the name by proxy of already resenting the son-in-law for whatever?", ">Trying to rationalize someone\u2019s grief from what they are saying they are upset about to a very traumatic time in their life isn\u2019t up to you. You can suggest therapy but let the professionals help them\u2026\n\n\nYou do not know the nature of the conversations and relationship they have had over the years for Op to rationalize like that. The fact that it resonated with Fran says Op said something she connected with. \nOp's message got her to seek therapy. Op cannot be an A H for that.", "She is a good mom. Yes she is upset about the name but she is willing to look for solutions that don\u2019t harm her son in the long run.", "That stood out to me too. The fact that Fran can recognize that something is off about the strength of her emotions is really impressive to me.\nShe knows something is off, just doesn't know where exactly the problem is but is willing to seek help to figure it out. \nA surprisingly rare quality in a person.", "JFC, if only everyone could be as rational and level headed as your SIL when receiving advice or being told they might be wrong! \n\nWe might actually have world peace\u2026.", "The people that bristle at therapy are the ones that need it the most!", ">It's also amazing how many people think they can ignore their kids (reasonable) wishes and stomp their feet saying \"I'm the parent so I can do what I like\" and it won't have any negative consequences down the line.\n\nI see you've met my mother.", "SIL even decided to go over to OP s house, so her son wouldn't hear. She clearly loves her son and is willing to do everything needed to be a good mom. Both OP and SIL are great people. Hope SIL finds the right therapist to help her. In-laws \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc", "And she had the foresight to have this conversation where there was no chance of her son overhearing it. Shes an incredible mum, and I hope she ignores her in-laws and gets the professional support she needs.", "and it's wild, to me at least, that the ILs are like \"no, have an iron fist with your son to ***make*** him use a name he doesn't like *as much*!\" like...therapy is 1000% the better option and I'm glad she took the therapy suggestion as well as she did.", "Exactly she understood that how she felt could hurt him.", "It's actually SIL's parents that are against the Therapie which makes it worse in my opinion. They disregard that SIL is doing her best to make her child happy as a good mum should.", "People like that, it's not really about the name. It's about control. If your child defies you by going against your wishes in some (harmless) way, the goal isn't to understand why and accept it, the goal is to force the child back into compliance."]}
