{"id": 26176, "submission_id": "169na9n", "title": "AITA for encouraging my SIL to speak to a professional about grief when she was upset about her son using a name she didn't like?", "selftext": "My SIL Fran, has a son who is 15. SIL is my husband's sister. Fran and I are close. She and I have become like sisters in the years I have been married to my husband. When Fran was pregnant with her son, she and her husband disagreed on baby names. He wanted something cool and unusual and she wanted their son to have a normal name. When baby was born they agreed to the compromise of a normal name and an unusual middle name. Fran wasn't super fond of the middle name. But felt like she'd have to compromise since her husband didn't really love the first name. For the sake of the post we'll say his name is Thomas Wave.\n\nAfter the birth of their son, Fran ended up pregnant again and suffered a very traumatic miscarriage that put her life in danger and resulted in her being unable to conceive again. She was, understandably, devastated and left very fragile afterward. But she never sought therapy and there is a grief there that she has carried with her for many years. She grieves for the baby she lost and also for the end to her ability to have more children. She wanted three kids prior to this. She decided to enjoy having a child because she said she was lucky to have one and some can't have any.\n\nWhen my nephew started school he told friends his middle name and they started calling him that and slowly over the last decade he has been using Wave more as his name instead of Thomas. He told his parents he no longer wanted to be Thomas and was instead going to be Wave and that everyone outside of family uses it now, including teachers and friends. They were aware people called him Wave but Fran thought it was more like giving it to him as a nickname.\n\nShe was upset he decided to go by Wave over Thomas. My ILs found it ridiculous and said all she needed to do was refuse to call him Wave and tell him that he needs a real name and not something made up and as his mother she should have that right to call him by his legal name. Fran came to me to vent and talk about it where her son wouldn't hear and be upset. She said it broke her heart to have him reject the name she had chosen for him and to know she had never liked the name he has chosen to use in his everyday life. She felt like a bad mom and a failure and even though it was dumb she was heartbroken (her words). She told me she couldn't understand why she felt so bad. I gently suggested that it might not be so much about the name, but some unprocessed grief over her miscarriage and inability to have more children and the fact her only child didn't like the name she had chosen. I said even if it is the name therapy could be helpful. She agreed with me and said she owed it to her son at the very least.\n\nMy ILs are not happy I suggested her to attend therapy. They said this is over a dumb name their son in-law gave their grandson as a middle name and Fran needs to take her advice and things will be fine. They said I was blowing things way out of proportion and acting like she had no right to be upset.

Encouraging therapy is a wise move. It's like realizing the tip of an emotional iceberg \u2013 the name issue might be just the surface of a more profound emotional struggle Fran has been going through.", "NTA and therapy is about providing your SIL with tools to understand her feelings and process them in a way that doesn't ruin her relationship with her son. Your ILs are out of line here and if Fran is happy with your advice, just ignore them. Their advice is \"Refuse to call your son the way he wants\" and her choice now is \"Refuse to listen to ILs to ignore her child wishes\".", "NTA. You have her great advice, you\u2019re probably right about it not being so much about the name but a combination of factors.  If your in laws aren\u2019t happy that\u2019s their problem. It\u2019s really unbelievable how many people still bristle at the thought of therapy.", "NTA You sound like a loving and supportive friend to a kind family member. 10+ years of unprocessed grief is a big burden. I think suggesting therapy is wholly appropriate", "NTA. Asking her to insist on a name her 15-year-old son does not want to use is terrible advice. There is nothing wrong with a 15-year-old making decisions about their own identity. Maybe he will someday change his mind. Maybe he will go with Wave till his old age. This is a decision he can safely make. Furthermore, in a few years he will be an adult, and he could legally change his name. Neither Fran nor your in-laws can win this fight, just damage their relationship with the boy. \n\nI think you have been a good friend in advising Fran to address why she is so bothered by this issue and suggest therapy.", "NTA, there is probably more to this than just the name, and it's good of you to notice. It may not even be related to not being able to have more children, could just be mental health issues. And I believe that speaking to a mental health professional is important no matter the reason, and sadly it's not always easily accessible.\n\nOn the side of the son, he's 15 there is no reason he cannot make his own decisions on what name people call him. I gave my kid one name, most family or friends of family call my child one nickname and they use a totally different name while at school, camp, sports. It's an important part of their self expression and growing up, they are their own person so why shouldn't parents treat them that way.", "NTA.  Therapy sounds like the absolute best answer for Fran.  That and staying away from her AH parents who say things like the their grandson has a \"dumb\" name and \"as his mother she should have that right to call him by his legal name.\"\n\nI bet more than a few issues about those loathsome charmers would come up in therapy as well.", "NTA. Therapy sounds like it would be very beneficial. Your in-laws sound awful though.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My ILs found it ridiculous and said all she needed to do was refuse to call him Wave and tell him that he needs a real name and not something made up and as his mother she should have that right to call him by his legal name. \" .. this is bullshit. Tell her not to do that, or she will soon lose her kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are right. She urgently needs therapy. The in-laws are AHs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
