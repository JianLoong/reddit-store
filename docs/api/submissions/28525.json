Go make her read terrible drunk driving accidents and tell her you wanted to avoid this. And that you offered to take her home safely. (But she had the right to say no to this if she felt unsafe)", "NTA. Extreme maybe, but drunk driving is very, VERY much a bad idea. You might have saved a life, protected property, and saved your friend from having a criminal record and a life of regret.", "Definitely NTA. From the information you provided she was clearly far too drunk to drive, and so you potentially saved not just her life, but the lives of whoever she would have crashed into on the way home. Whatever the opposite of Asshole is, you're it.   \nClearly her judgement isn't the best right now. But she'll think more about it over the next few days, and hopefully someone else will tell her how drunk she was and she'll realise you were only looking out for her.", "NTA.

Better angry than dead or a killer", "NTA - and she should be thanking you for keeping her from making what could have been the worst mistake of her life. Recently, 4 of my son's friends were drinking at a bar. One of them decided that it was okay to drive. Fast forward, and they were involved in a head on collision. Two occupants of the friend's car were killed on impact, 1 person in the other car was seriously injured, and the other 3 people suffered minor injuries. The 4 that were drinking/driving were 21-22.

Have you ever seen the people crying saying they should have stopped someone from driving drunk after they died? Have you pulled a body from wreckage?

If the friendship goes up in flames, it might even be worth enumerating what a terrible position this person put you in.\n\nI suspect this friend is lashing out because of embarrassment.

I think your friend needs help with their drinking if they think they can drive like that.", "NTA. You did the right thing.

If she genuinely stays mad about you prioritizing her safety when she was that far gone, then it's time to cut ties with her.", "NTA for taking the keys.\n\nHowever I don't blame her, drunk or sober, for not wanting a man to drive her anywhere while she was incapacitated. You seem to be dismissing her concerns because you know you were right about the keys.\n\nBut did it occur to you to ask her if there was anyone she WOULD feel safe driving her?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
