It\u2019s a very complex job that requires a lot of training. Though we are in the office, training happens in a virtual class. There\u2019s no direct supervision. We do some hands-on work, but for most of the day we\u2019re observing our trainer in the virtual classroom. \n\nSince day 1, one of my coworkers (20-something F) has been falling asleep during class. She was very obvious about it too, putting her head down on the desk. I heard her snoring on multiple occasions. A few days ago, I made a joke about it in our group chat and the trainer noticed it. I explained what was happening to the trainer in private chat. A few minutes later, one of the on-site supervisors walked in to catch her sleeping. She was called out of the room and talked to, then returned. She didn\u2019t put her head down again but began sleeping with her head in her hands. Yesterday, the on-site supervisor came in and caught her sleeping again. Once again she was called out of the room and returned minutes later.\n\nThis morning we found out that she will not be returning. Some of the people in training class are blaming me for telling on her. I\u2019m of the opinion that she got herself fired and I did nothing wrong. So what do you guys think, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675957885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xy2e3/aita_for_getting_my_coworker_fired/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm generally indecisive and tend to excuse others' behavior. That said, she was blatantly falling asleep during training/work hours so getting fired was bound to happen sooner or later. At the same time, what was her situation? Falling asleep one time is understandable I guess, but every single day? It's odd that a supervisor (or the prof) hadn't seen her before you said smth.. She was the instigator to her own downfall", "She absolutely got herself fired.  It would have happened eventually, either from being noticed sleeping in class or simply not knowing the required information.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She didn't get fired because you told on her, she got fired because she continued to sleep during training even after being spoken to and given a second chance.", "NTA\n\nAnd I honestly cant believe the ones who blame op, she obviously got a warning the first time, then she kept it up afterwards, she only get herself to blame.", "NTA, wtf. If she hadn\u2019t been sleeping in class then she wouldn\u2019t have been fired at the end of the day. Sure, you clued the trainer in to the situation and that\u2019s what started the supervisors coming and checking up on y\u2019all, but she literally didn\u2019t try to change even after being spoken to the first time. Get her out of here if she wanna mess up her opportunities like this \ud83d\ude29\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe", "NTA - and if the training team were on the ball, they would have caught her sooner themselves.   The fact that she did this multiple times means she did this to herself.  At most you alerted them to a problem; obviously they stayed on it after that, hence her firing.", "NTA she would've gotten fired eventually but learn to mind your own business unless you like being the office pariah", "NTA because she had multiple chances but in the future I would refrain from getting involved with anything that doesn't directly affect you.", "NTA\n\nTo be honest, it sounds like she would've been caught one way or the other considering how she wasn't even trying to hide it. Unless she's suffering from some kind of narcolepsy (which I'd assume would've been brought up in the talk with the supervisor if that was the case), it sounds like she was being very unprofessional.", "NTA\n\nIf there's any danger from not doing your job well it's for everyone's safety and you should be commended.\n\nIf there's no danger than it's easier to say YTA but while unfortunate she lost her job, they would have figured it out eventually and you just sped up the inevitable so at worst you're just a tattletale.", "NTA, she wasn\u2019t training, but sleeping. Most places you get paid to trained, so she was essentially getting paid to sleep.", "NTA she get herself fired also it's really bad for all customers who she would impact and probably coworkers if she would be slacking in their shifts.", "NTA- she was falling asleep during training. It sounds like she was given at least 1 chance to not screw it up and she almost immediately screwed up by not staying awake.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't be defensive about whether you weren't wrong or were right. It's just not going to land well. Dunno how I'd handle it.", "No, unless she had a sleeping problem or couldn't sleep at night due to forces out of her control, then she shouldn't have been sleeping.", "If she got fired right after your joke Yta but girl was caught three times lol NTA", "Not the asshole. She was the one who was sleeping through work. It was her responsibility to have a good night\u2019s sleep.", "NTA but man you should start a YouTube channel *how to make everyone hate you*", "\n\nYTA\n\nShe would have either been noticed without your \"help\" or it would quickly become obvious when she didn't have the knowledge needed to do the job. Maybe she's sick or has some messed up home life.\n\nJust...yeah. MYOB", "Don\u2019t be a narc and mind your own business.

It would\u2019ve been best to mind your own business since it wasn\u2019t your job to monitor her.  maybe she has a newborn? Maybe she has to work a late night shift at a second while she trains at this job and until she starts? Who knows? You could\u2019ve messaged her directly with a heads up and said hey a couple of people have noticed you\u2019ve fallin asleep in class. Unless this were a position that revolves around saving lives in which case she should be at 100 then I would\u2019ve minded my own. Also weird that you\u2019re hyper focused on her activities during class instead of on yourself and the complex materials. Now your other coworkers won\u2019t trust you for sure.", "If lives aren't in danger, side with labor. \n\nYTA for unnecessarily mocking someone, and for doing so in a venue where management would reasonably notice. If she's sleeping in class, she's probably going to get weeded out at some point. \n\nAll else equal, there's no reason to help that along. If the snoring was bothering you, you should have spoken with her about it. You do deserve to be able to train in a productive environment. If she continued to fall asleep and intrude, then you'd have some cause to speak with the trainer.\n\nBut, reductively, she got the boot for the sake of your earning a few chuckles.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to protect a co-worker from her own actions. She likely would have fallen asleep on the job, endangering you all or making you all have to cover her work.", "I hate hate hate hate people like this at work. I find it so fascinating how hard it is to A) Not care or B) just maybe put yourself in her shoes. Is her sleeping have anything to do with your paycheque? Nope. YTA idc \ud83e\udd28", "YTA.

You literally tattled.  What was in it for you?  \n\nThe kind thing to do would have been to nudge her and tell her she was snoring.

They are there to present their knowledge, not police grown ups.", "It's the responsibility of the instructor to confront the woman about it, not his.

The point is he should have minded his own business and so should you.", "Then an easy NTA.\n\nReally, if you start covering for a bad coworker before the work even starts, they'll expect you to cover for them later on.

If she had addressed this with her manager beforehand and got a medical accommodation nothing would have come from it.\n\nHe pointed out she was sleeping instead of training, that's a simple fact and not an opinion or judgement.

I don't know what he was thinking when he went to the instructor.  But I do know it wasn't \"that poor lady seems so tired, I wonder why.\"  Nope, he just blabbed.  And being an adult he knows what the consequences are and he didn't care or even thought she deserved them.\n\nAlso let's be real, she's young, he's not, if he thought anything he thought partying.", "Ok, well, that's a load of crap.  He knew nothing good was going to happen if he told on her.  If it's such a simple fact with no meaning or implications, why even mention it.  \n\nSomeday you'll find out that life happens, you can't prepare for everything and a stranger not being an AH will make all the difference.", "Well, that's where we disagree.  There was no problem at all until he made one for her.   He could have ignored it at no cost to himself.", ">why even mention it. \n\nBecause it is outside the norm and should under no circumstance be occurring.\n\n>not being an AH will make all the difference.\n\nI think you have missed the fact that sleeping on the job is an AH move. This person's ability to work directly affects all of the other staff. Even if OP had called the coworker out in front of everyone, which he didn't do if you actually read what he stated to the instructor, calling out someone else's AH behavior does not make you an AH.", "No, her sleeping when she should be working is a problem, whether higher ups know or not.\n\nIf she wasn't doing anything that would get her fired, OP going to the supervisor would do nothing.\n\nThe issue is her behavior, not his reporting of it.", "\"This person's ability to work directly affects all of the other staff.\"\n\nYou don't know that.\n\n\"Even if OP had called the coworker out in front of everyone, which he didn't do \"\n\nHe told them what he did, or someone did.  Because now some of them think he's an AH remember?\n\nWhatever, I'm done with you.  Keep licking those boots", "So, you're just going to report anybody you see doing anything wrong? If they call in sick and you find out they weren't really sick, are you going to report that too?\n\nHave fun I guess, I'd say anyone who behaves like that is an AH."]}
