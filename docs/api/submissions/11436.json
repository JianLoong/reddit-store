She's a kid let her be one. You should maybe reflect on your own parenting, because he seems like a wonderful father and frankly the fact you think a 10 y/o should have to fend for herself is actually kinda concerning.

It sounds like you raised a very sweet, loving man, which is why your judgment is so surprising to me.", "So, making a lunch for a child is now considered spoiling them? What the fuck? YTA.", "YtA. This has NOTHING to do with you.", "Ew. I hate this. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with spoiling your kid to a certain extent. Is she turning into a little monster? No? Then nothing wrong is happening, and your son is just showing his daughter how much he loves her by doing these little gestures. And FYI, showing love usually takes up some measure of time.\n\nAnd yeah, it is none of your business.", "If this is the only example of spoiling then YTA - unless he\u2019s also doing up her shoes, helping her dress, doing her homework for her (or allowing her to skip it), refusing to insist she learn and use manners when talking to others or giving her lavish gifts on a regular basis then this isn\u2019t a spoiled child, it\u2019s a single gesture of care from a loving parent.", "YTA.  He's right.", "YTA its none of your business.", "YTA\n\nNot only is it none of your business but you're talking about a packed lunch. It's not like he's buying her diamonds and bankrupting himself, he's making his 10 year old daughter lunch. Not exactly crazy is it?", "YTA - It IS none of your business. It's an act of love, not of spoiling. If you think that making a 10 year old lunch is \"spoiling\" then I can imagine what a loveless childhood your son must have felt he had.", "YTA not your child not for you to opine on", "YTA your son sounds like an amazing father. It's great how your son turn out so well despite his shitty parent.", "Survey says YTA . Your son is right it\u2019s none  of your business. Is there  a age when you bc stop making lunch?

I will pack my child's lunch with a loving note every day, because I want her to feel loved. He wants his baby to feel loved and cared for. Maybe he knows what it's like growing up without that feeling.", "It isn't your business whats wrong with doing a nice fun lunch for your child? Yes you are an AH", "YTA\n\nAnd I think you should reflect on your son's childhood and how you raised him. It seems he doesn't think your methods were exemplary. Are you sure he doesn't feel some resentment or disappointment when he remembers his own upbringing?", "YTA. I agree with your son completely.", "YTA. 10 years old is not too old to have her lunch packed for her, and it sounds like her father is doing it in a way that makes her feel special. That's good for their relationship.\n\nOnce she gets to middle school and high school (over age 12), she will likely pack her own lunch, and at that time it will be a good skill for her to learn. But at 10, she has a little more time to be Daddy's girl. Quit resenting her.", "Yta. Honestly your comments just make you sound jealous...are you just upset he spends time with his kid and not you?", "You know why he does that for her, right? It's because his mom made him pack his own lunches at 10. Yta", "YTA. as a rule, unless your son actively asks for parenting advice from you, his choices on how to parent his daughter are none of your business.", "YTA. I've never fucking known a 10yo that makes their own lunch. Hell, most kids I know didn't start making their own lunches till high school. Lemme guess? You also grounded your kids for no reason because it looked like they were having too much fun??? I'd say you are the one who needs to grow the fuck up, and recognize that kids are not just mini adults.", "YTA.\n\n10 year olds making their own lunch? It\u2019d be full of sweets and chocolate!! \n\nHe\u2019s doing something nice for his daughter - what\u2019s the harm in that?", "I can\u2019t believe I even have to write this\u2026  Just because your son decides to make a sandwich with a smiley face on it when he packs his daughter\u2019s lunch, doesn\u2019t mean your grandkid is going to turn into some kind of refusal resistant anti-christ.

Sometimes I will surprise them with little notes in their lunches or bags, normally asking a ridiculous rhetorical question which they then laugh about with me at dinner that night.  What's wrong with enjoying packing your child's lunch and making it interesting at the same time?\n\nI think you need to take a look at why it is such a big deal to you that your son is taking time and effort and, most importantly, love into making his daughter's lunch.  It's almost as though when at school he wants to still be able to bring joy to her.  Just because you didn't want to do it, doesn't mean he can't.  I applaud him for doing so, and for telling you to mind your own business.  It really has nothing to do with you.  You could have simply thought what a nice thing it is to do for your granddaughter, but no.  Apparently making her lunch interesting and fun is a problem for you.  Maybe take a long, hard look at why that might be the case.", "YTA!! Mind your business.. he sounds like an amazing father and also she still a kid.. this isn\u2019t the old ages.. parents are now making sure their kids feel safe.. I can\u2019t imagine what kid of sad and loveless childhood your son had with you.. you sound like an awful parent. I hope he makes sure YOU don\u2019t cause his daughter the trauma I\u2019m sure you cause him..", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo he is a loving parent, and you were not.

You sound exhausting. None of your business and do not insert your opinion on something you have nothing to do with.", "YTA. You don't describe a single negative behavior from her. You don't describe her behaving badly, acting rudely, acting as if she is entitled to things, or being demanding. \n\nDoing kind things for people isn't spoiling them. *You cannot do too many kind things.*\n\nSpoiling would be allowing her to behave rudely or act as if she should have anything she demands. \n\nBehaving in a loving way doesn't do that. Lack of correction over misbehavior does that.", "YTA. It is none of your business.  \n\nSo what if he makes her lunch and decorates her sandwiches.  If he doesn't mind and he enjoys it, leave him alone.", "YTA. IT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!!!", "YTA. I'm sorry he only implied it. This is none of your business. She's a kid. Let him pack her lunch.", "YTA. It's really thoughtful of your son to not just pack his daughter a lunch but also take the extra time to make it special. This is what exceptional dads do.\n\nMy dad packed my lunch till I was 17 and the only reason it stopped was because my parents got a divorce and my dad moved out. I will always remember and be grateful for those lunches.", "YTA. My dad made my school lunches for me up until I left home (18). It doesn't make you spoilt; it's literally lunch. Now if he'd bought me a couple of cars, a pony, the expensive make up, multiple handbags...maybe that would have made me bratty. But not lunch.", "Parents demonstrating love and support of their children through simple (less than 10 mins per day is simple) acts of kindness that make their children\u2019s day isn\u2019t spoiling children! It\u2019s ensuring a secure parent-child bond that enables attachment and emotional resilience for the child\u2019s development. \n\nHe could choose to show that love in a million and one ways, but seriously - making a 10 year old lunches isn\u2019t spoiling.", "Lol. My mum packed my lunch from kindergarten up to when I'm already working. The only reason she stopped is because I moved to a different country for my grad studies. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 She just wants to make sure that I eat healthy and steer away from fast food (since I'm a lazy cook). Am I spoiled? I don't think so since I'm the one paying the bills (I wire her the money) using the money I got from my part-time jobs. I also don't care if I have to do odd jobs to earn. I don't expect people to do things for me. I missed my mum's cooking from time to time, but I don't throw tantrums when I go to the nearest Maccas for a fix \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo, yeah. YTA. Don't know why your thought process led you to think that a parent doing something sweet for their child is somehow not a good thing.", "YTA. It's called love and caring, you might want to try it sometime.  /s", "YTA\nI get the feeling that after witnessing your son's adorable parenting habits you either feel a bit guilty for not doing stuff like that yourself, or you're jealous of the bond he has with his kid as a parent. Perhaps both.", "INFO: how is she spoiled?", "YTA. I was ready to hear a story about a girl throwing tantrums and a father giving into every whim and it\u2019s really about\u2026lunch?\n\nShe\u2019s 9, not 19. Maybe you made him pack his lunch at 9, and he wants better for his child. He sounds like a sweet, caring and loving man. You should be thrilled, and not critical.\n\nAll my friends and I were still packing our kids lunches at that age. They\u2019re all grown now and the one thing they\u2019re not is spoiled.", "It's none of your business.", "YTA.  Mind your own business.  Your son is an adult.  Follow your own advice and let him parent on his own.  You\u2019re a hypocrite.", "YTA he didn\u2019t ask for your opinion. He obviously enjoys doing this. His daughter probably loves it. Why are you trying to crap all over something nice?", "YTA I still do this for my teen. Can she do it herself? Absolutely and she has done mine as well if I'm under the weather. She has a shoebox filled with notes I've packed since kindergarten it's our thing. They'll come a time when they go off to their own lives. It's ok to cherish sweet moments with our children", "YTA cooking for someone is almost always an act of love", "YTA. I see this with people where they mistake love and consideration for \"spoiling\" and \"babying.\" I make my 14yo breakfast and pack her lunch. I do it because I love her. She's very independent and self-sufficient OVERALL -- she commutes an hour each way to school on public transportation, she does a lot of babysitting and earns and spends her own money. Making her a nice packed lunch is not \"spoiling\" her, it's a way of staying connected and showing her love and support.", "YTA - \n\nIt really is none of your business. Your comment about hugs made me so sad for you - giving or receiving affection is not a weakness, nor does either have an age limit.\n\nAlso, you might want to do some reflection: I am definitely getting some misogyny vibes here. I feel like a big part of your issue is that your male son is spoiling his female daughter. Somehow I bet you wouldn\u2019t be throwing a fit if his wife was packing lunches for your granddaughter or your son. His time is not inherently more valuable because he is a man, and she is not less worthy of his time because she is a girl.", "Yta. Apologize to your son and try to repair it.", "YTA\n\n Are you upset that he loves his daughter?? For real? What's wrong with spoiling your child with love?", "Sounds like your son did everything different from you and you are feeling inadequate. Tough shit. Gtfo with your comments. Yta.", "YTA.

He's putting effort into his daughter's lunch. That's hardly spoiling her.", "OP would think I was a spoiled monster... my dad usually packed my lunch for me throught high school!\n\nWe both knew I could pack a lunch for myself (and sometimes I did), but my dad would get up a little earlier for work and would make both his and my lunch. Not because I was demanding or because he wanted to spoil me, but because he loved me.\n\nI still think about it from time to time, and it fills me with joy. Kids remember those kinds of things, it's what reminds us to do those seemingly insignificant things acts of kindness for others.\n\nYta.", "YTA - So bizarre. This isn\u2019t an issue.

It insures she has a properly balanced and healthy lunch to get her through the day, and do better in school and classes, while also feeling loved by her parents.\n\nMost normal people pack their kids lunch untill they are teenagers. There's usually a point around middle school/high school where they just start to refuse a made lunch, and usually by that point they're able to make a healthy balanced lunch themself because they have learned by example. And this isn't just a western thing. I have a friend in Asia (Taiwan spesifically) who's mom still packs their lunch when they go to work, because his mom cares about him and loves him and he's not spoiled. Also perfectly capable of making his own lunch too!", "Yes, actually it is. Parenting advice has changed.  My 11 year old asked for a cuddle last night and I cherish those moments.  They are less frequent, but when he wants to feel loved and secure I want to do that for him.  He's also learning to do laundry, learning how to cook things, learning how to SEE mess/clutter.  These ideas aren't mutually exclusive.", "YTA. You gave unsolicited advice. You say your kids started packing their lunch at age 9 and that's why they're not spoiled. Maybe your son packing his daughters lunch is a reflection of how he was raised. You claim he is a sweet loving man and not spoiled because you made him pack his lunch at 9.
