What's wrong with enjoying packing your child's lunch and making it interesting at the same time?\n\nI think you need to take a look at why it is such a big deal to you that your son is taking time and effort and, most importantly, love into making his daughter's lunch.  It's almost as though when at school he wants to still be able to bring joy to her.  Just because you didn't want to do it, doesn't mean he can't.  I applaud him for doing so, and for telling you to mind your own business.  It really has nothing to do with you.  You could have simply thought what a nice thing it is to do for your granddaughter, but no.  Apparently making her lunch interesting and fun is a problem for you.

This is what exceptional dads do.\n\nMy dad packed my lunch till I was 17 and the only reason it stopped was because my parents got a divorce and my dad moved out. I will always remember and be grateful for those lunches.", "YTA. My dad made my school lunches for me up until I left home (18). It doesn't make you spoilt; it's literally lunch.

Your comment about hugs made me so sad for you - giving or receiving affection is not a weakness, nor does either have an age limit.\n\nAlso, you might want to do some reflection: I am definitely getting some misogyny vibes here. I feel like a big part of your issue is that your male son is spoiling his female daughter.

So your son wanting to 'spoil' his daughter says more about you than it does about him.\n\nAs I say to every family I look after - you cannot spoil a child with acts of love. \n\nDon't comment again unless you want to have no relationship with your granddaughter.\n\nEdit: your comments are even worse. She's 10. She definitely knows how to pack her own lunch but this is something her dad enjoys doing for her. Being part of her day. The same way a lot of wives pack their husbands lunch. When they go to eat their lunch, they will be reminded of their wonderful partner or in this case, her father! One day he'll be dead and all she'll have are memories of him. You come across so heartless to think you're the perfect mother and he's somehow failing his daughter for making her a cute lunch.", "YTA.

Turns out not only have you not mentioned any behavior that comes off a spoiled, but what your son does is incredibly sweet and personal. Who cares what age she is, if his daughter likes it and her dad is willing to do it, let it be. This will be a great memory of her childhood, why do you feel the need to ruin it? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asked to cut them out yourself. SMH\n\nAlso, I pack my wife\u2019s lunch. She works later than me and yes she can pack her as well.

It is that the daughter isn\u2019t doing enough work to be self sufficient. Especially in non western  countries children are expected to be doing a lot more work than countries like the USA. They don\u2019t want to raise a spoiled child who doesn\u2019t maintain the things that need to be done.  Cleaning your room, making breakfast, packing your school bag.

I can\u2019t help but think of all of those awesome Bento boxes I see people post on social media that all involve cute things like this! Or it could even be the case that OP\u2019s granddaughter is more likely to actually eat at lunch time if it\u2019s cut into little shapes and not come home a hangry monster. \n\nThe dad for sure is NOT wasting his time either by packing her lunch or doing such reasonable things to make them special.", "She\u2019s a mom to anyone who needs one tbh she\u2019s an amazing childcarer.

Tell him how much you loved the tradition and how much you miss the doodles you'd saved. If you can't, then I'm very sorry, whatever the circumstances <3", "Thankfully my dad is still alive and well :) You're right, I absolutely should tell him that!", "I'm betting OP is much more permissive and nurturing to men but believes girls mature faster and need to take on more responsibility earlier.\nThis is absolutely untrue of course. Kids should be allowed to be kids no matter what.", "this was my life as well. my boy is my child. no way would I ever treat him like they treated me. am NC to make sure my son never has to deal with when the worst of their mood strikes.\n\nhonestly that cruelty and manipultive is their true nature. the niceness is what's strange and such a challenge for them to us.", "Both my parents (Born in 1924 and 1925 respectively) had abusive AH for fathers.  My Dad got beaten with a belt.    \nThey swore \"not my kids\" and stuck to it.    \nKind of amazes me to this day.  You can choose not to be your parents.  Absolutely.", "Do it! Any decent definition of self-care totally includes fun shapes for lunch.", "I think people are only reading the part where you make your kids make their own lunches and skipped over the rest.", "Yep. I grew up dirt poor with nothing and I spoil the shit out of my kids whenever I can. I want them to have everything I never did and more. But they also appreciate it.\n\nI\u2019m never going to feel bad for spoiling my kids.", "In high school I usually bought lunch, and my entire sophomore year that lunch consisted of a giant chocolate chip cookie and a cup of kool-aid. Maybe I had a snack pack from home of smart food popcorn.", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one who thought that she wouldn\u2019t pack herself a good lunch", "My dad was drawing a heart around my name on my bagged lunch every day my senior year and it was the highlight of my year. This OP is the kind of person who will lose contact with her son and grandchild with their actions. Let the man be a father.", "I kinda want raw cookie dough now?", "I'm just picturing you whipping out the tube of cookie dough and gnawing on it. LMAO", "Yes! Exactly this! I have a 10 year old daughter also and I cannot even fathom how someone can consider the joyful parts of parenting to be spoiling your children. As you pointed out, part of that joy comes from doing things FOR your children. \n\nI\u2019m just even thinking about cooking in general. It\u2019s totally normal for one person in the household to cook family meals. No one considers that spoiling people. It\u2019s just how meals go. It\u2019s part of being a family.", "Those first three sentences made me tear up, sir. You have a lucky kid(s).\n\nOh and YTA OP", "One second they're screaming \"I hate you!\" because you won't let them stay out all night when they're 14, or wear a mini-skirt that started life as a toddler's tshirt, and  the next thing you know, they're young moms themselves and they're calling you all \"no, mom, really, I need your honest advice.\"  \n\n\nIt's a roller coaster, for sure. :)", "I love when my daughter 7 or step daughter me ask for help, if my oldest daughter 25 would ask me for help with something I would gladly jump up and help. The older they get the less help they need, honestly kind of breaks my heart as a dad when Im not needed as much.", "I think 10 is the age where if they pack their lunch it should be guided. Cause I know 10 year old me would've been a little biased with what I picked.", "I was thinking that if it were DIL that was making the packed lunches, OP likely wouldn\u2019t be so worried about Grandchild being spoiled by Son taking his time doing womanly duties. \n\nHis time. His effort. His child. Child\u2019s lunch. Why TF it has anything to do with OP anyway, is a mystery to me? \n\nYTA. Parker\u2019s are for winter. Not for noses. Back off.", "I think its because a lot of people have equated spoiling someone with spoiled behavior, when they arent indefinitely connected. Doing nice things for someone because you care about them doesnt automatically equal spoiling, and regardless, much like doing bad things from time to time is different from being a bad person, spoiling your loved ones occasionally isnt the same as making someone a spoiled person.", "...haha, I'm proud of myself if I have goldfish instead of forgetting to eat!", "I'm 44 and actively trying to convince myself right now to go make a real lunch instead of just eating cheese filled mini crackers", "I fucking love goldfish.  I buy the shit out of them.  Much healthier than doritos or whatever else I would eat.", "Omg hearing this made me cry \u2764\ufe0fmy son is only 3 but thats how I was with my parents and I pray everyday my son wants to spend time with me like that when he is older. It must be the most heart warming thing!"]}
