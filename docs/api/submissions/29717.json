My mom, dad and i (20F) have been taking care of the baby. I babysat from January to july for 70us a month (i was deprived from school to do this btw) i can do many aita stories with this family\n\n\nFast forward to now, my mom's doing renovations on the house and the baby started daycare in September. Last night she told me that she has a lot of stuff to buy the day after( paint, fans, wardrobe etc) and I knew she was hinting at me having to watch the baby ( my mom gets the baby ready for school on a morning and collects her after school).\nBut she never actually got to asking me but i figured it out. This morning she woke me up asking if im still going to watch the baby and I said yes. The baby doesn't like me anymore because she has gotten used to my mom and has serious attachment issues with my mom. So every time i come near the baby when my moms around she would scream and cry and throw a tantrum because she doesn't want me to take her away from my mom. So every single morning the baby follows my mom and cries occasionally so my mom can pick her up. I can usually hear them and the baby crying every day but i dont help because id literally make the situation worse. Now it's suddenl a problem this morning. My mom's taking the ba' school because im not \"helping her\" when I litera.., dont every morning and she said that im the worst out of my siblings and i am a selfish and bad person. I am extreme confused because I literally woke up at 6am and told her that i would watch the baby. And I do this every morning(not helping with the baby). AITA??\n\n\nEdit:\nI saw a bunch of comments suggesting that I move out. I genuinely wish I can but I am not from America and finding a job where I am is difficult. I also only just got a bank account last year and my mom chose to do house renovations and buy a vehicle instead of helping with my education like she promised( because our beliefs don\u2019t align anymore). I also watched the baby for 7 months for 10hrs a day. And i did agree to watch the baby. My mom got frustrated before i got the chance to.

She should be angry with your sister who has effectively abandoned her child with your parents. \n\nI\u2019m angry on your behalf this has impacted your life and your studies.

The fact that even the baby can't live without your mom just shows your sister was never there for her baby.", "NTA\n\nThis baby is not your responsibility, Your Sister is an AH for not looking after her own child, your Mum is an AH for enabling this.\n\nyou are an adult.

Get out as soon as you can.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom is the AH here. this is not YOUR kid, she should adress this to your sister, not to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMove out, and escape.", "YTA\n\nSounds like the way you feel about your sister has spilled over towards your feelings to this child. You sound like you avoid the child at all costs. You leave it all on your mother to do on her own, which is why the child is so attached to her. You live in her house, she asked you for your help, and because the baby MIGHT cry, you refuse.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with your mother\u2019s response however, but I can understand the frustration.", "YTA - The end of your post was confusing. Did you help her with the baby or not? It sounds like you didn\u2019t because the baby wound cry.\n\nUnfortunately your mother is trapped taking care of her granddaughter because your sister is trash, and even though you are an adult living in her house she can\u2019t count on you either. Of course she\u2019s super frustrated. I pity your mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She takes advantage of the fact that we all love the baby and uses it against us. I\u2019ve been through alot tbh. Too much to even explain here. My mom( she is in charge of finances and stuff because my dad is literally a baby too) chose to do renovations instead of helping me pay for school because my beliefs do not align with hers anymore( she is a Christian) and where i live it is extremely hard to find a job so I can\u2019t exactly move out like all the comments are suggesting.", "I say this everyday. She is so kind to my sister but hostile towards me. And she would still come to me and my other sister(23F) to complain about her. Yet she never does anything to change it", "I genuinely wish i could leave so bad. But I am not from the US and it is extra hard to get a job where im from so I dont have much money lol.

I\u2019ve watched her for 7 months for 10hrs a day. And no one appreciates that. I also specifically stated that I did agree to watch the baby so im not sure what you\u2019re talking about. She only got upset because I didn\u2019t help her with the baby whilst she got ready. And i only didn\u2019t because it literally happens every single morning and if i do actually help the baby would scream and cry.", "She was getting ready to leave and i was supposed to watch the baby from 6am-4:30pm. Whilst she was getting ready the baby likes to follow her everywhere. So i let her follow her and my mom got annoyed at me for allowing that. But if i intervene the baby will throw a tantrum( screaming and crying). I get that my mom is frustrated but my feelings also matter. No one ever considers my feelings. She got frustrated even before i could actually watch the baby whilst she went to work."]}
