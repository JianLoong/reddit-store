Our neighbour has a  little girl around Mora\u2019s age and they\u2019ve become friends quickly. I\u2019ve only met the mum a few times but she seemed lovely enough.\n\nAnyway, a few days ago, I was reading a book on my porch when I saw my neighbour, Leah, pulling into her driveway. When she saw me, she motioned at me to wait for her so I put on my flip flops and came over to help carry her groceries while she tells me whatever she wanted to tell me.\n\nShe started the conversation normally but then quickly turned into what she heard the girls talking about when they were playing yesterday at her house. And she was \u201cappalled\u201d (her words, not mine). Apparently, the girls were playing with barbies (yes, my 10 year old still plays with them occasionally). So, the appalling thing my daughter did was not call her family dolls grandmother, instead she called them abuela and babcia (hence the mention of Mora\u2019s background earlier) one being Spanish for grandmother, the other Polish, that\u2019s how she calls her grandmothers. And Mora\u2019s new friend asked why and Mora explained it. And as kids, they continued playing.\n\nLeah was distraught at the idea that my child doesn\u2019t call her grandmothers, grandmas or nans or whatever else you\u2019d called them in the US. I tried to politely explain to her our reasoning, but she went on a tangent how I am ruining my daughter\u2019s future with messing up with her head, threatening to call CPS on me (yeah, she really said that) and that I am trying to brainwash her daughter into changing how she calls her grandparents (wtf?).\n\nAnyway, I hate wasting my time on arguments and she clearly wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind. I put the groceries down, told her \u2018have a lovely day\u2019 and walked back to my house.\n\nI thought she might realise later what she\u2019s done was wrong but no, she started telling all my new neighbours about the situation and she tried confronting me again. I told her to drop it and mind her own business, but she wouldn\u2019t stop. I eventually called her a stupid twat and told her to never talk to me again. In a twist of event, it seems some of my neighbours think I am the asshole for calling her that. I am confused, I didn\u2019t think calling someone a twat would be much of an issue but here we are.

Shove it up your twat/snatch.", "Same, I hear twat I think idiot.", "One other you should know is a word starting with an f British ppl use for cigarettes. I'd say most Americans only know that as an anti gay slur, and some may be vaguely aware after pausing to think that it also means cigarette in Britain but still good idea to avoid using that word around Americans\n\nIt's funny how words have different meanings in such similar places. I was initially confused why you referred to someone you'd hardly met as \"lovely\" before realizing you meant what Americans might call \"nice enough\" - we usually reserve lovely for ppl or things we genuinely like a good deal, at least in my region", "Welcome to 'Murica!\n\nI was born and raised in the US. Still here. Some people take offense to certain words and other people to other words. In my experience, cunt is probably one of the most offensive names you can call someone (after racial slurs). I don't personally take offense to it and know that it's thrown around in some countries the way we call people 'dude'. Twat on the other hand isn't anything to worry about. Using voice to text in this comment didn't censor it the way it did with cunt. People choose what they want to be offended by. A former girlfriend got offended when I called her 'silly'. I didn't understand, but I respected her request not to use it again.\n\nYour neighbor, given her ignorance in people speaking other languages and using those terms of endearment sounds exactly like somebody who would be offended at being called a twat. These are the same people who call liberals snowflakes and don't recognize that they themselves are the actual snowflakes.\n\nI'm sorry your experience here in the US hasn't been 100% pleasant, I wish there was more acceptance of people coming from other countries and speaking other languages and having different cultures. Where I am in the greater Seattle area it's pretty good but you don't have to go far to find bigotry.", "Yeah, those two words generally don\u2019t go over very well here.

I\u2019m Syrian and American and I called my Syrian grandparents grandma and grandpa in Syrian. Sometimes it was annoying to have to explain it to friends but not a big deal at all. I love sharing the Syrian culture with others who honestly prob didn\u2019t even know it was a country. I love learning about other cultures too. Some Americans are unhinged as we can see by our current political landscape here. Sorry you had to deal with her but happy you\u2019re only there for a short time. I hope you have better experiences in America!", "NTA. I am British and my partner is from a Portuguese country, we live in the UK. Our son has Nanny (my mum) and Avoa (my partners mum) along with Aunt's, Uncle's, Tia's and Tio's etc and no one has any issues. I cannot fathom someone having an issue with him or any child calling their grandparent the name from their respective country. The fact she went as far as trying to start a hate campaign is baffling.", "Definitely NTA, she is absolutely in the wrong. The only worry is that your daughter might have lost a friend because of it, but honestly it sounds like her friends Mum might have nixed that anyway even if you'd been polite...", "In the USA, calling someone that is VERY offensive, just as offensive as using the n word!\n\nThe woman is a nut. just avoid her and don't fight with her.", "NTA this woman is projecting her ideals on you and being disrespectful to your daughters culture and heritage. Then would not drop it. You were badgered and had enough. No one tried to brain wash anyone. Her ways are not the way. And I bet she lied to the neighbors to get them on her side. She is not a true representation of neighbors in the US.\nEdit to add I'm also of polish decent and have lived in the US my whole life. I always called my grandmother on my dad's side babcia. This is not unusual. The US is a melting pot. Unfortunately people like your neighbor got in the pot as well.", "NTA\n\nThis is merely an indication that this neighborhood is full of pretentious white Americans who are pretty well as racist as politely possible.  Really frosty polite xenophobia.  The women are probably awful to each other and burn money in MLMs, their husbands likely watch too much porn and support Trump.  \n\nWho cares if they think you're an asshole, I personally, as a hopefully less pretentious white woman, actively enjoy being hated by these types of people.  I hope to live a happy, contented life they can't stand.  It's a point of personal pride for me.\n\nSo I'd say enjoy being hated by these types of people and get into a better neighborhood.", "NTA \n\n\nTwat and cunt  are both cause for significant pearl clutching and damnation here in the states.

NTA.", "NTA. I am not AT ALL excusing your neighbor\u2019s unhinged tirade, but in American English twat is slang for vagina. That could be why the other neighbors are upset. It\u2019s also unhinged to be more upset about that one word than about her behavior. All Americans are not xenophobic, in fact I doubt most are.

How is that appalling or trying to change the language the friend uses? \n\nAt her age I had neighbours from Bangladesh and while all the children grew up with multiple languages, and their father was fluent in English, mum was very much still learning, and I often asked how to say things like good morning, and thank you in their language to say to their mum (although she knew those words in English, I just thought it would be nice to include her a bit more, especially saying thank you if she\u2019d fed me or anything). My parents were happy I\u2019d shown interest in their language and culture. I\u2019d be happy if it was my child too.", "Had the neighbour literally never encountered people who call their grandparents something from the grandparents native language? In Australia it's super common even for mono-lingual people. Every second person has a nonna or yiayia or lola etc. Is it really that uncommon in the US?\n\nETA: In my family we even sometimes use different language names for each person in a single pair of grandparents.

My family\u2019s from Scotland and they use the C word like they\u2019re trying to salt the world\u2019s blandest food.

She's an idiot and very stupid. \n\nIt's very normal for children to call their parents and grandparents by their culture's/language's name. Even, maybe especially, in the USA. \n\nFor her to think, for a moment, that CPS would give a damn is mind blowing and shows the depth of her stupidity. \n\nSidenote: Twat is an \"vulgar\" term for vagina and is used an insult.
