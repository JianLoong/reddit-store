We\u2019re only going to be living here for the next few months so we enrolled our daughter into an international school so she doesn\u2019t have to change her curriculum.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that my husband is Chilean, I am Polish, our daughter is obviously both and she speaks both, Spanish and Polish, as well as English because we normally live in London.\n\nWith that out of the way, we moved into our new house a little while ago. Our neighbour has a  little girl around Mora\u2019s age and they\u2019ve become friends quickly. I\u2019ve only met the mum a few times but she seemed lovely enough.\n\nAnyway, a few days ago, I was reading a book on my porch when I saw my neighbour, Leah, pulling into her driveway. When she saw me, she motioned at me to wait for her so I put on my flip flops and came over to help carry her groceries while she tells me whatever she wanted to tell me.\n\nShe started the conversation normally but then quickly turned into what she heard the girls talking about when they were playing yesterday at her house. And she was \u201cappalled\u201d (her words, not mine). Apparently, the girls were playing with barbies (yes, my 10 year old still plays with them occasionally). So, the appalling thing my daughter did was not call her family dolls grandmother, instead she called them abuela and babcia (hence the mention of Mora\u2019s background earlier) one being Spanish for grandmother, the other Polish, that\u2019s how she calls her grandmothers. And Mora\u2019s new friend asked why and Mora explained it. And as kids, they continued playing.\n\nLeah was distraught at the idea that my child doesn\u2019t call her grandmothers, grandmas or nans or whatever else you\u2019d called them in the US. I tried to politely explain to her our reasoning, but she went on a tangent how I am ruining my daughter\u2019s future with messing up with her head, threatening to call CPS on me (yeah, she really said that) and that I am trying to brainwash her daughter into changing how she calls her grandparents (wtf?).\n\nAnyway, I hate wasting my time on arguments and she clearly wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind. I put the groceries down, told her \u2018have a lovely day\u2019 and walked back to my house.\n\nI thought she might realise later what she\u2019s done was wrong but no, she started telling all my new neighbours about the situation and she tried confronting me again. I told her to drop it and mind her own business, but she wouldn\u2019t stop. I eventually called her a stupid twat and told her to never talk to me again. In a twist of event, it seems some of my neighbours think I am the asshole for calling her that. I am confused, I didn\u2019t think calling someone a twat would be much of an issue but here we are.

It is very sad that this grown women simply can NOT understand that cultures have many different names to use to refer to grandparents.   And, really, what is the big deal??   The girls seemed to have no issues with it.    As for the other neighbors, if they approach again, ask if they know the WHOLE story??   Have them retell it, if you can.

CPS?  Whoa, that's going nuclear.  I'd like to hear that complaint.  And the response from your attorney!\n\nShe's weird, people in the USA use all sorts of names for grandparents.

Say you do regret that term you used but that she had threated to call CPS.\n\nThen its time you stopped your daughter hanging around with hers because it will be dangerous for you and your daughter.\n\nThen I'd confront her husband and see if he is reasonable or as racist and undedicated. Then if they are in the same class at school tell the teacher.", "NTA. You called it like you saw it. She has no right to tell you how to raise your daughter, or to object to her being multilingual in both sides of her heritage. Geez, at least your daughter's enlightening the neighbor's kid that there's more than one culture in the world. There's no problem not calling a grandmother grandma. Our children called one set Nana and Pops, and the other set Gamma and Bumpa, at least until the kids got older and felt silly using the childish nicknames.", "Your location must be really unique.
