All are competitive dancers.  For this season we are at a new studio this year.  On my twins team they are the youngest and most girls have been on the team 2-3 years already.\n\nI noticed one girl on my twins team was often the only one without a parent. We can call her S. During costume try-ons S was the only one without a mom/dad. I thought it was odd that no other mom was offering to help her so I took S under my wing. The same thing happened at a few other pre competition meetings.  I casually mentioned it one night with the other moms. I was told that S\u2019s dad owns a business and is always working or traveling for business. Her mom is obese and can only walk short distances which is why she doesn\u2019t come inside.  She waits in her car during practice.  They said nobody helps because her mom is incredibly rude/entitled. Her daughter never has the correct materials, such as dance bag with garment rack that were required to have, hair/makeup not done, costumes, a mess.  I decided I\u2019d help S, it\u2019s not her fault.\n\nThe third competition is where it all fell apart. It was a large all weekend competition with 2 performance/award rooms. All 3 of my kids would at one point be dancing almost back to back in separate rooms so I knew I\u2019d be running.  I texted S\u2019s mom before and let her know how busy it would be so I would need S to have her hair/makeup done and costumes steamed.\n\nS shows up with all costumes a mess and no hair/makeup done. First three dances were pure chaos. I get them all ready for their fourth dance and I am ready to run to watch my oldest dance.\n\nI quickly look at the schedule and see S is doing her solo shortly after the current dance.  I then realize S never gave me her solo costume, and find it rolled into a ball in her duffel bag. Complete wrinkled mess. Not one mom from our studio is around to help. I miss all 3 of my kids dances to steam S\u2019s costume. They come back and I get S ready.  Her costume was as good as I could get it in time but it\u2019s not perfect. She gets on stage and her mom looks at me and says, \u201clook how wrinkled she looks! She better not get points off! Her hair piece doesn\u2019t look secure either!\u201d \n\nA few days later at next practice I speak to the owner about possibly solutions and I\u2019m told she has had many conversations with her mom and unless there\u2019s a change she\u2019ll be off kick out after this year.  I go outside to talk to her mom by her car.  I let her know that I\u2019m sorry but I can no longer help.  It wasn\u2019t fair that I had to miss my kids dancing because I was caring for her child. I explain my frustrations. Then I suggest she hire someone to help S and say I know some teenagers who would do it and I could reach out for her if she\u2019d like. She lost it on me and told me she isn\u2019t hiring anyone, I should continue to help, and if her child is kicked off it\u2019s my fault. I know S isn\u2019t my child but I feel awful.\n\nAm I the asshole if I don\u2019t help S?", "created_utc": 1679626061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1206piz/aita_for_telling_a_disabled_mom_i_wont_help_her/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No? Than you aren't responsible for her, and have every right to call the mother out on her neglect. From the other parents response to your question, you aren't the first person to be treated this way, and it has discouraged anyone from helping her daughter.

She's just lazy and using a disability as an excuse.", "NTA. \n\nAnd honestly I would try using social media to contact the dad. Maybe he will hire someone.

It'll only be that woman's fault for not taking care of her daughter. \n\nDon't feel guilty about it and continue the good work with your kids. \n\nHelp the kid when you can but not to the extent where you would have to miss your children's dance. \n\nS isn't your priority, your children are.", "NTA. You were very kind to help S, but she's not your responsibility.

Its amazing that you've been helping S out, especially with twins!! 3 girls dancing at once? That's gotta be hard on you! I'm sorry you missed yours' dances. Hopefully someone recorded it, at least?", "NTA.  I would not talk with the mom.  I would help the child if you are able and if it doesn't interfere with your own kids.  If it does just tell her \"I'm sorry but I can't help you with this.\"  It is unfortunate her mother doesn't care.  I'm happy she brings her at least.", "You\u2019re NTA and none of this is your fault. Mom is not disabled. She can do her daughter\u2019s hair and makeup at home, steam her costumes, and buy her proper equipment. She also can get a walker or scooter to help her with mobility issues. I appreciate you want to help this girl, but you have three daughters to care for. You MISSED their dances!! Pretty soon your daughters are going to be upset that you are putting this girl\u2019s needs above them. The other moms learned their lesson early\u2026now it\u2019s your turn.", "NTA.

Maybe someone can talk to the dad and enlist his help.", "NTA, let them kick her child off the squad.  You take care of your children first.  The mother was angry at you because her lack of self esteem.  Which is the true root of her problem.\n\nI know this going cause people to go off the air.  Because, it is taboo and politically incorrect to talk about obese people in a negative light.  But, here it goes. \n\nI doubt the mother is obese from a disability other than food-in-mouth disorder.  Her husband is on business with his secretary. He doesn't want a messy divorce.  But, he doesn't want to sleep with his wife who has let herself go downhill and she doesn't want him to see her body.  She doesn't go into the dance studio because she is embarrassed of herself.  I have never seen this woman.  But, she can't be much worse than Honey Boo Boo's mom and relatives.\n\nThe real shame is the little girl is the one that deals with it at the studio and in school.  Children can be extremely mean, especially little girls.  Yet, she's there with no one.  The dance studio should provide a proxy Mom to children in this type of situation.  Even if it is an extra charge.", "[deleted]", "No.  You tried. NTA.", "NTA.  She'll continue using your generous help as long as possible of course. I feel bad for S too but she sadly probably knows what her mother is like. Kids know. I think the owner really needs to step in now. The whole situation is an unfair burden on you.", "NTA. My heart hurts for S but you can\u2019t be responsible for someone else\u2019s child to the extent you have been. Her mum sounds like she is truly the worst. I also kind of wish the other mums would all rally around S to help her so she isn\u2019t suffering the consequences of her mum\u2019s poor behaviour but I understand that\u2019s not a sustainable long term solution.", "NTA poor S is in for the long haul until she can do more for herself and get outta there. There's only so much you could do to help her in the first place, especially with mom determined to run everyone away.", "NTA: I have incomplete paralysis of the legs and am a 100% P&T service connect disabled veteran. If I cannot do something myself I am well aware that I need to find outside resources or hire someone to aid me. \nIf anyone was so extraordinary to assist me, I for one would never take it for granted, never assume it's guaranteed, and certainly still compensate the person adding me. \n\n\nYou are not the AH. It's not your fault the child will suffer due to the mother's lack of involvement and appreciation. \nAlso, dance is a hell of an investment and should not be taken lightly the latent likely knows this but again refuses solutions. You offered cheaper did and instead got backlash. \n\nAbsolutely gtfo from that. \n\n\nIt's easy to do something when someone genuinely appreciates it. It's a chore otherwise.", "NTA. You missed all three daughters performances for helping. You're their for your kids, not entitled mom's kids", "NTA You were very nice to help out, but her mom needs to take responsibility. She can put makeup on the kid, fix her hair, and iron her clothes while sitting down, so her inability to walk long distances is not an excuse.", "Can you somehow get ahold of her father through his business?\n\nNTA", "Nta. You missed out on watching your kids dance. How do you think that made them feel. Is that what you want to keep on doing.", "NTA for telling the mom you won't be helping out anymore.   \n\n\nBut Y T A to yourself for not heeding the warnings of the other moms.", "Me too!!", "Right? This woman sounds like the absolute worst combination of can't be arsed asshole and nightmare stage mom. I feel for S, but honestly I'd say it would almost be better for her at this point if her mom's behavior got them blackballed from the local dance scene.", "While I agree society has taken an odd turn at glorifying the health disaster obesity is. I think you are making a multitude of assumptions from a context outside this posting. My spouse has gained much weight and become morbidly obese after we got married. She is still the most beautiful person in the world to me and our marriage thrives. I just wish she prioritized her health more. Thankfully she is starting to accompany me to the gym a few times a week and it is making a great positive difference. Anyway, I think we can take the assumptions out about the obese mean mom and just list facts; she does not show up, does not allocate time, effort, or resources to her kids' extra circular event, and does not show gratitude for others aid. \n\n\nThe studio has no obligation to produce extra aid. op offered people to help for a small cost and was met with backlash. \n\nThe mom of the poor child is entitled and rude. It would be largely different if the mom was appreciative and was agreeable to using more time, and resources to support their child.", "Frankly, that is the dance studio\u2019s and instructor\u2019s job, not OP\u2019s. It sounds like the studio has tried and the other parents have tried, but they can\u2019t get mom to care about her own child. OP has gone above and beyond for this girl, including missing her own three daughters\u2019 performances.", "[deleted]", "Yes, it is. And I have been that person trying to help the kids falling through the cracks. OP has three children she needs to care for first. She tried several times to help this girl and talked to mom. OP is stressed, frazzled, feels bad, and now mom is blaming OP if daughter gets kicked out. Expecting OP to continue to shoulder this or find other people to do it is an unfair expectation."]}
