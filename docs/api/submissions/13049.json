All are competitive dancers.  For this season we are at a new studio this year.  On my twins team they are the youngest and most girls have been on the team 2-3 years already.\n\nI noticed one girl on my twins team was often the only one without a parent. We can call her S. During costume try-ons S was the only one without a mom/dad. I thought it was odd that no other mom was offering to help her so I took S under my wing. The same thing happened at a few other pre competition meetings.  I casually mentioned it one night with the other moms. I was told that S\u2019s dad owns a business and is always working or traveling for business. Her mom is obese and can only walk short distances which is why she doesn\u2019t come inside.  She waits in her car during practice.  They said nobody helps because her mom is incredibly rude/entitled. Her daughter never has the correct materials, such as dance bag with garment rack that were required to have, hair/makeup not done, costumes, a mess.  I decided I\u2019d help S, it\u2019s not her fault.\n\nThe third competition is where it all fell apart. It was a large all weekend competition with 2 performance/award rooms. All 3 of my kids would at one point be dancing almost back to back in separate rooms so I knew I\u2019d be running.  I texted S\u2019s mom before and let her know how busy it would be so I would need S to have her hair/makeup done and costumes steamed.\n\nS shows up with all costumes a mess and no hair/makeup done. First three dances were pure chaos. I get them all ready for their fourth dance and I am ready to run to watch my oldest dance.\n\nI quickly look at the schedule and see S is doing her solo shortly after the current dance.  I then realize S never gave me her solo costume, and find it rolled into a ball in her duffel bag. Complete wrinkled mess. Not one mom from our studio is around to help. I miss all 3 of my kids dances to steam S\u2019s costume. They come back and I get S ready.  Her costume was as good as I could get it in time but it\u2019s not perfect. She gets on stage and her mom looks at me and says, \u201clook how wrinkled she looks! She better not get points off! Her hair piece doesn\u2019t look secure either!\u201d \n\nA few days later at next practice I speak to the owner about possibly solutions and I\u2019m told she has had many conversations with her mom and unless there\u2019s a change she\u2019ll be off kick out after this year.  I go outside to talk to her mom by her car.  I let her know that I\u2019m sorry but I can no longer help.  It wasn\u2019t fair that I had to miss my kids dancing because I was caring for her child. I explain my frustrations. Then I suggest she hire someone to help S and say I know some teenagers who would do it and I could reach out for her if she\u2019d like. She lost it on me and told me she isn\u2019t hiring anyone, I should continue to help, and if her child is kicked off it\u2019s my fault. I know S isn\u2019t my child but I feel awful.\n\nAm I the asshole if I don\u2019t help S?\n\nEdit: the mom has a disabled placard on her car. I assume the disability is more than being obese.

Because, it is taboo and politically incorrect to talk about obese people in a negative light.

But, he doesn't want to sleep with his wife who has let herself go downhill and she doesn't want him to see her body.  She doesn't go into the dance studio because she is embarrassed of herself.

Thankfully she is starting to accompany me to the gym a few times a week and it is making a great positive difference.

She\u2019s gonna lose something she loves because her parents can\u2019t be bothered to do her hair and steam some costumes.", "NTA. You're a good one OP. This is \"it takes a village \". Honestly, you'll see this in a lot of group setting. Sadly, there's always that one kid. Sometimes other parents don't know what to do because their children aren't vocal about it, sometimes other parents aren't too confident  talking to other adults and being proactive of their kids needs and sometimes they're just lazy. You'll recognize it after awhile and provide help accordingly but don't do it where it'll compromise your own.  You can help as long as you're done with your kid first and not when you have to be there for your kid. That's healthy boundaries. Nothing wrong with that. You can also help by telling the child she needs to go to her mom to do this etc. You can suggest telling the owner/teacher to let the dad know so he's aware before kicking the kid out. I believe you've done what you can and this is something you can't do anything about except pray the child will be ok. Trust me that kid will remember the kindness that you've and anyone else has shown.", "I would have used violence but that\u2019s just me. NTA and amazing to you for being calm. You can only help where you can.", "NTA stop helping and stay out of it all.", "NTA\n\nIt was nice of you to take S under your wing.  It's sad that her parents can't be there for her.  You offered the mom a solution - hiring a teen to help.  Having a disability isn't an excuse to not take care of your child.", "File this under:  No Good Deed Goes Unpunished.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I can only imagine what goes on in this child's home.", "NTA - You went out of your way to help someone who wasn't getting what she needed from her parents, and when you explained that you no longer could, she had an entitled temper tantrum, blaming you for her own failures.\n\nIt's quite sad that the girl suffers the most as a result of this, but absolutely none of it is your fault.", "ESH (except the kids) for missing your kids dances. You were warned the other mom would not appreciate your help, being a martyr is not a positive thing when it's your kids who lose out from it. When you can help others, great, but don't throw your kids under the bus to do so.", "I cannot imagine causing an entire person to exist only to make strangers care for them while I sit in the car. NTA", "NTA. The mother is lazy and can't be bothered with her daughter. It's a shame, I'm sure S is talented but there's only so much you can do for someone else's child. You've done more than enough and, if she can't be a mother the one time it's important, it's not on you to pick up the slack. It's a sad situation but it's not your problem. You've done everything you can.", "YTA for missing your kids performances. NTA for telling the mom you can no longer help her child.", "NTA. Whatsoever.", "NTA. But if you ignore your kids to take care of others you will be. You tried but in the end you can't light yourself on fire to keep others warm, especially when they're choosing to sit out in the cold.", "YTA out of kindness but still YTA. You missed supporting your daughters - your smiling face in the audience - although I did see your comment that they did not know. \n\nBut that is also pleasing for you, to prep them and see the wonderful results. \n\nS is not starving or being abused. She\u2019s simply not being supported as the dance studio requires. The dance studio looks bad when she\u2019s wrinkled with no makeup and hairdo. THATS THE STUDIO\u2019S BUSINESS. They will enforce their standards. \n\nThat\u2019s why they told you to stay out of it. Stay out. Love on your little girls; you\u2019re busy enough.", "NTA. I totally understand how hard this situation must be, you are trying to help a child in need because no one else is helping her. I'm sure the other parents felt the same way and initially helped her as well but there is a reason why they stopped. The mom is using you and will keep using you until as long and as much as she can. This is a no win situation for you. You are spreading yourself thin and missing special moments with your children, which is not fair to you. The mother will just keep asking/ expecting you to do everything for her child and will continue to be rude and aggressive towards you. The mother knew the work involved when she signed her daughter up for dance and if she was unable to fulfill those duties, it was her responsibility to either choose another activity that would be easier for her to manage or make arrangements for someone else to help her. Trust me, when you are dealing with people like her the only option is to stop helping completely and cut off all communication with the mother.", "Former competition dancer here:  absolutely NTA.  This mother is the worst kind in this situation (and that's saying a lot.)  Ofc, it sucks for S, but you also have kids and need to be there for them in the absolute chaos that is these competitions.", "I have a 9 year old daughter and then a set of twins who are 6 years old.", "> she told me that wasn\u2019t the nanny\u2019s job so I didn\u2019t push it\n\nHow you refrained from saying \"it's not my job either\" is beyond me.", "I think so too. You\u2019ve already gone above and beyond and I\u2019m sure S appreciates it, even if her mom does not. You\u2019ve done all you can do. \n\nNTA.", "I was going to make the same suggestion. See if the studio can charge extra and have the money go to extra things that are needed for the daughter plus salary for a teenager or someone else there to help her when needed.", "Well, hell. Now I feel like I've just got to know.\n\nChances are 50/50 that he'll say \"thank for bringing this to my attention\" or \"why can't you just stop being a bitch and do what S needs?\" \n\nI hope OP updates us if she decides to take this route!", "I genuinely have no idea why you think an issue has to be the result of a birth defect or incident in order to qualify as a disability.

What a weird take.", "I have said it so many times, you just keep ignoring it: an issue made by your own actions is not a disease or a disability.\n\nPeople choose to eat more and not exercise --> sure, your health gets worse, but it's all because of your actions and it does not deserve the label disease or disability.\n\nAs the whole world, except the US, does.\n\nNo, I still dont care and have absolutely zero pity for these lazy fucks.", "A disability is not the same thing as a disease. A disability is a condition that impedes a person's ability to interact with the world.

The fact that no one wants to deal with this person says more than enough. I feel so bad for her daughter, you are a wonderful person for at least giving her that much for her to enjoy the dance program.", "Was her name Abby, and did she threw a chair at someone at some point by any chance?", "NTA. That mother is taking advantage of you for free labor. You are a saint to try and help this poor girl, but it is coming at the expense of your own kids. (as the child who saw their mother do all this effort for someone else and not be there for me, it hurts. A lot.)\n\nIt's not like you're denying the child food or shelter. Hobbies are non-essential.

(And let's face it, you know you're going to continue to help. Bottom line is that it's the studio owners job to deal with idiot parents not yours, you shouldn't have to. Thank you  for what you have done I'm pretty sure that you have probably shown that little girl a lot more kindness and support,  than she's used to.", "Nta. She is. She could have plopped her butt in a chair and steamed those outfits at home. So unfortunately her daughter will have to stop dancing.", "NTA  \n\n\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions.", "NTA.  I feel so sorry for this child, but it is not your responsibility to care for her child.   You told her that you would no longer help, and you don\u2019t owe her anything else.    \n\n\nThis almost seems like a situation for child protective services.  If this child is only 6 years old, should she be alone in this building without an adult?  What about the dance studio?  Have you mentioned to them that there is an unsupervised child?  It seems inappropriate.", ">  people were never grateful\n\n\nI do see your point, but were the kids not grateful even if the useless parents didn't appreciate it?", "That's fine, all she has to do is walk a short distance away from her.", "Who cares if she's mad.", "No, words mean things. It's literally not neglect even if it did upset you.", "You didn\u2019t answer the question"]}
