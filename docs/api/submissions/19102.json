Tell her she can wipe it or you can add a cleaning fee every time you need to clean her crusted on bodily fluids.\n\nMy dad always did this so I\u2019m very familiar with what old exploded zit on a mirror looks like, but I can imagine being extra horrified to newly find out that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been wiping up.
