The fact she is the one \"that has to look at\" it doesn't give her any right to decide what you do with it. Beyond that, tattoos are an important part of you are, if she can't accept it, then why is she in a relationship with you?", "NTA - A couple of things here. \n\nFirst, she should not have ambushed you with this conversation when she was getting ready to walk out the door for work. This is actually pretty serious and deserved a full and unhurried conversation. She is also being immature by ignoring your messages (assuming that is not work related). \n\nSecond, you and she need to revisit this conversation. Before you do that, you need to take some time to think through how this makes you feel about her and your future plans for body art. Is this a dealbreaker for you? How would you feel if this was a dealbreaker for her? If its not a dealbreaker for her, but she will be upset, what would you do? Would you feel like you couldn't get any more? Would you resent her for that? Would getting more knowing that it bothers her take some of the joy from it? \n\nBottom line - you deserve more of a conversation about this than she was willing/able to have with you this morning. I think you also have a right to feel upset that she didn't mention this earlier in the relationship. Don't rush any decisions. Think about what you want. Talk to her. Then both take some time and then talk again.", "NTA idk what she\u2019s expecting, a dude who has tattoos wants more tattoos \ud83d\ude31! If she hates them so much why would she date someone who has them", "NTA.  It's your body and no one has the right to police it.  It's unfortunate that your GF is only now mentioning that she hates tattoos.  I hope you haven't wasted too much time on the relationship.", "NTA- if she hates tattoos so much I can\u2019t imagine why she would date someone with tattoos, and not mention it for years. I am heavily tattooed and they are a huge part of my identity. I plan to tattoo myself until there\u2019s no room left, and I have a partner that loves it. No one else should dictate how you express yourself, especially not a partner who is supposed to love you for you. The tattoos aren\u2019t going anywhere, if she truly loves you and wants to be with you, she\u2019ll have to accept that this is how you choose to express yourself.", "YWNBTA. I can empathize (sort of) with your girlfriend, as I don\u2019t really like tattoos and my husband is considering getting his first one. I give him my honest opinion when he asks, but I won\u2019t tell him what he can or can\u2019t do. It\u2019s his body and his decision. And her response does puzzle me considering you had multiple tattoos from the beginning and always planned on more.", "NTA, why on earth is she telling you now that she hates tattoos.", "NTA. I don\u2019t like tattoos and probably wouldn\u2019t date someone with them, but it\u2019s your body and your gf knew what she was getting into. If she doesn\u2019t like them, it sounds like it\u2019s time for you to go your separate ways.", "NTA. You're going to have some tension if you do get it, but it's not her say in whether you can get them or not. Us women face this discrimination every day, told that it's on us for the clothes they wear that determines how men feel about us and treat us, which is all bullshit. If guys have problems with how women dress, that's a reflection of themselves that they have their own biases and issues to work through that are informing them they need to dictate how women dress.\n\nIt's a similar concept here; she doesn\u2019t have to like tattoos, but if the tattoo is not offensive or attacking a marginalized community and and in fact expressing something beautiful that is meaningful to you, then she really shouldn't be worried. I think that if you have established a solid foundation for love and trust, then that is a personal bias she has to work through. Even if she sees it every day, it doesn't determine who you are or your attractiveness; that is a very superficial ideal. Her feelings are valid, but it should be causing her to take a moment of introspection and ask why this matters so much to her, not to actively try and stop you from getting a tattoo. It's also on her for not expressing her feelings at all while you've had this scheduled for months, and you've also gotten previous tattoos.", "NTA just pick do you want the girl or the tattoos because you can't have both.", "NTA  \nIt's your body. You can consider her feelings in the matter, but your body, your rules. Just as she should not be required to cut, style, or color her hair to your tastes, neither should you be required to change how you want your skin to look.  \n\n\nShe's expressed a boundary. You can honor it if you like, but her boundary is out of bounds, strictly speaking. She's stepping out of her lane.", "No you would not bta. It's your body, not your girlfriends and she can choose to put a bag on her head if she doesn't want to look at you", "Oh no, YWNBTA. She is TA for not clearing things up years ago, and then saying that. \"I'm the one who has to look at you\" felt hurtful, and I'd be pretty upset learning my partner feels that way about my style or my body. I wouldn't be able to look past that regardless of what you choose. I hope you find a gal who's just as jazzed about your ink as you are!", "Nta get the tattoo and lose the girlfriend. \nI know it seems like something small to separate over but honestly I would just leave her now because you're going to want more tattoos and she's going to complain every time and what happens if y'all have a kid and one day they want a tattoo you're going to fight about that", "NTA.\n\nWhere the hell was this when you guys met? Why is she saying this now?", "NTA\n\nOne more isn\u2019t going to change you having all the rest,m.  \n\nIf you had one tiny one and were now planning on a full sleeve she still wouldn\u2019t get a controlling say.  As in, she could tell you she doesn\u2019t like them and may stop dating you, but would YOU want to keep dating then?", "NTA. BUT I wouldn\u2019t get it, it sounds like you need to have a serious conversation with your gf about the future of your relationship. She is the one who got into a relationship with a tattooed person and she has never voiced her problems with them for 5 years, why is that? Is it possible her parents or someone made a comment or try influencing her? Did she feel this way the whole time? You need to figure out what\u2019s going on and how to proceed.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she's trying to pick a fight to have a reason to break up. As someone who went through the same thing with my ex-husband.....believe me the tattoo is worth it.", "Nta keep doing what you doing", "If you've been together 5 years and the thought of you doing something as small as this makes you sick, then she probably isn't the person for you. \n\nPhysical attraction is important but there are people out there that are not as shallow as your gf\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you need to have a very serious conversation with your girlfriend as well as yourself.  \n\nA lot of people will say it\u2019s your body and you can do what you want.  That is true, but you are also in a relationship with someone else and this will affect that.  You both need to decide how important the tattoos are in this context.  \n\nIt needs to be an honest conversation.  Are the tattoos more important to you or her than maintaining this relationship?  Will either of you become resentful if you do or don\u2019t get them?\n\nFiguring out what compromises and tolerances you have are important in a relationship.  It\u2019s very rarely an all or nothing.", "NTA. That\u2019s really weird and controlling of her\u2026", "NTA\n\nYour body, your choice. PERIOD.", "NAH.\n\nOf course it is your body, your choice.\n\nHowever it would also be her choice not to want to continue dating a person that doesn't consider her feelings.  Do you consider her preferences in other ways?  Food? Music? Movies?\n\nIt is also OK for her not to like tattoos, and to feel more comfortable expressing that opinion at age 24 than at age 19.\n\nAgain, you're not AH for getting a tattoo.  The question is whether you want to risk the happiness of the last 5 years over it.", "My husband is like this. Seriously. It's my body and I refuse to be told what I can and cannot wear/tattoo etc. \n\nI got a face tattoo. \n\nI am also getting a chest tattoo eventhough he hates it. I like it and that's all that matters. \n\nTell her you don't want her doing something with her appearance and see where it lands you lol", "NTA\n\n\"But I'm the one that has to look at you.\"\n\nIf you don't get the tattoo, please throw this back at her face for the rest of her life. Every outfit, every thing she wears, every haircut, etc. should be vetted through you because you're the one that has to look at her.", "YWBTA. I've seen plenty of people post things like this, and everyone always says things like \"NTA. Your body, your choices. It doesn't affect her in any way. How can she make demands like this?\" And all that. Always the same thing. \n\nTruth is, a lot of them are also people who are in serious long term relationships who have done similar things. They've sometimes gotten rid of or stopped getting tattoos, lost weight, changed diet, dressed differently, and so on and so forth. Many of them probably did even more serious things despite the fact that there was no direct effect on their partner (ending friendships is a big one, often done without any concrete reason or cause for jealousy, but people get jealous anyway). All of those things they did for their partners, despite everything they might say on posts like this. They did that because what their partner thought or wanted mattered more than what they wanted. \n\nPeople object to this crap in principle, because we all hate demands like this being made of us (even if it isn't an outright \"demand\", which it often is). But it's only an objection in principle most of the time. Truth is, when we are in our particular circumstances and we care about our particular relationship with our particular SOs, we make our particular compromises. I wouldn't necessarily make the same compromise as another person, and vice versa. That's fine; we each have our own lives to live, and have to make our own decisions about what compromises we can/want to make. \n\nYou say your girlfriend is your life partner. If you mean that, you have to find a way to make your own particular sacrifices and compromises for her and for your relationship with her. Going out and getting the tattoo in spite of her will damage or destroy the relationship. You need to sit down and have an actual discussion, not an argument. And if it doesn't work out, then fine. But you've said she's your life partner, so you have to treat her as your life partner, take her objection seriously, and try to make a compromise.", "NTA. If she wanted to wear sexy clothes in public and you didn\u2019t like that it would be something you could tell her how you feel about but ultimately it would be her decision.

If she really hates your tattoos that much, why did she get into relationship with you? Don't let her encourage you and go get your newest tattoo with a smile on your face! \n\nMy fiance knows I want more tattoos (only 3 so far, one before we got together). I only get meaningful tattoos and even though he disliked one of my tattoos at first, he accepted it was my body and got used to it.

No, because it's her body and appearance. So no, NTA for exercising your right to body autonomy and style, but if this is a boundary or deal breaker for her, don't be surprised if you're a non asshole with fresh ink and no girlfriend. Which actually might be for the best, honestly. You're better off finding this incompatibly now, and if she's waited so long without communicating properly your relationship was probably doomed.", "Exactly. It's not any better than when randos comment on your appearance in public. They can have their opinions, but they don't get to tell you to cover up or not wear something. \n\nOP, you had these before the relationship and got more DURING the relationship. She has no leg to stand on here. She can express her opinion that she doesn't find them attractive (that's a separate issue) but it's your body and you can do whatever you want, assuming that you aren't getting any hateful or incredibly tacky tattoos. \n\nTo flip it, if you had said to her that you want her to be dressed up and wear makeup all the time because you \"have to look at\" her, would she be okay with that?

I'm not attracted to tattoos. My ex got a ton of them after we got married. I told him how I felt and left it at that. Other issues with the relationship ended things.

Good for you for understanding compromise!", "Sounds like a super healthy idea for a relationship!", "Honestly, i think i needed to hear that, Thankyou for taking the time to put it in words its just my body image is a lot to me, all my tattoos have meaning behind them and to hear that she doesnt like them hurt me a lil, i do believe a sit down discussion is in order, Thankyou!", "You are right. i meant and should have said future tattoos.", "I mean the plastic one will last a lifetime.", "Third.", "I laughed thanks bud", "Reddit has an image of the perfect relationship that matches so few real relationships. At the end of the day they're about compromise, and valuing the other person as much as yourself. There is no universal law of relationships, and everyone engages with them differently. The goal is to find somebody you match with MOST things on, and the rest isn't a big deal. \n\nIt's easy when it's things like \"oh she doesn't like Will Ferrell but I love his movies\", and it gets hard when it's stuff like \"doing this will change my 'how horny for you i am' score\", think things like men shaving their head/face or women going for a non-natural hair color like neon green or something. Tattoos are a harder one because they ARE permanent changes compared to my previous examples. But then compared to something like letting your health go to shit they really don't effect anything except aesthetics. \n\nSo make your case in a regular conversation, don't give an ultimatum, and consider the \"how horny I am for you\" score, do you value those points or the ink more?"]}
