My sister is in her 40s and with an \u201cman\u201d in his 40s. He is the baby dad of her oldest. They didn\u2019t work out due to him being an drug addict and an alcoholic. She moved on to marry her now ex husband and have an kid with him. After the split with her ex husband she went looking for the BD of her oldest. We\u2019ll call him Bob, she found him. He was homeless, still addicted to drugs, still addicted to alcohol, no job, and no car. She brought him into the house we both was contributing to. Everything was fine until he started eating everything, stuff came up missing (including medicine), and he started becoming aggressive to me and my daughter (I hadn\u2019t had my second one yet). I had got in contact with my dad to help me move to my friend\u2019s house who had offer me a place to stay until I found something. Instead he offered me to take over my grandpa\u2019s house (my grandpa had passed a few months prior and left the house to my uncle). I took the offer bc it\u2019s an nice 3 bed 2 bath with an huge yard and an country setting. My dad is currently staying with us for a few months so I can get an savings up and get an car (my BD is withholding the car I did have). I\u2019m currently using my dads car. My sister had called and I was talking about how we both had court on the same day. I guess I was on speaker bc Bob piped in from the background and said \u201cNo you are not giving her an ride and she needs to find one.\u201d Mind you I haven\u2019t asked her for an ride since we shared the house bc I\u2019ve been using my dads car. So she hurried up and hung up before I could confront them. I messaged her saying it\u2019s bull crap she lets him do that when I still continue to allow her to have the bills in my name. She has bills up in the thousands and couldn\u2019t get them on in her name. Her credit is shot as well. I went on to tell her she\u2019s dating an bum that\u2019s only with her bc he doesn\u2019t want to be homeless and starve to death. That he served no purpose bc he takes her money and pisses in jugs and let\u2019s them lay by the bed. I said I was embarrassed for her bc she goes around bragging about an engagement ring he brought with her money and then took the proposal back saying he was drunk. He pays for dates and etc. with her money. I asked her what does Bob really have and going for him besides addiction. I have people telling me I\u2019m an asshole for doing this to them and I need to apologize. I don\u2019t think I was being an asshole cause nobody will speak up and tell her that she needs to leave him. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Nothing I\u2019ve done has hurt her. She\u2019s ignored everything about Bob and she\u2019s been allowed to see the kids when Bob isn\u2019t around. She\u2019s perfectly fine.", "created_utc": 1675960541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xz5xo/aita_for_telling_my_sister_im_embarrassed_for_her/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m paying all the utilities on the house and it was my dads idea to stay for a few months to get an savings up. Taxpayer program? Honey I don\u2019t get any benefits from the state \ud83d\ude02 the only thing I get regarding my children is child support from their father which they should. So please try again sweetie. Once again you sound very idiotic and jealous bc you don\u2019t have parents that care about you or family that has property for you so you don\u2019t have to pay rent. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m better off then you. Get a better family? That would be my advice for you \ud83d\ude18"]}
