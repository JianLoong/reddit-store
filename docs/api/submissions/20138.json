They are the type that will pick apart anything someone says in any situation and police it from their own moral high ground.  How is it that you, as the subject of Derek's comment, took it for what it was meant, a well intended kudos for putting in work on yourself, and YOU are the awful person?  I literally hate being around people like that.", "NTA. Serena is right that weight can be a touchy subject. People gain and lose weight when they don't want to or for medical reasons. However it is your other friend who said something so her comment should have been directed at him.\n\nWhen you said that it was okay for him to comment Serena should have backed off.

I would guess more people find this type of comment encouraging than offensive..", "NTA.  While obviously it's generally rude to comment on people's weight, Derek gets a pass because 1) he's a close friend who knows you well and is obviously aware to some extent of your health struggles, and 2) the comment was made in a way that was clearly genuinely complimentary, not creepy/suggestive/harassment (based on the reaction of OP and the other people in the group who heard I. In context). It makes me very sad that we've reached a point in our society that a man can't appreciate and compliment a woman on her appearance without being bashed for it. \n\nWhile it wasn't necessary for Serena to comment, the refusing to let it go is where her behavior crosses the line.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While you were not bothered and your reaction was perfect, please don\u2019t verbally comment on anyone\u2019s weight journey until they bring it up themselves. Assume that the comment would not be well received. I\u2019m only adding this because you mentioned that you know not to bring it up with Serena, but in actuality, you should never bring it up until invited (or in a case where you are exceedingly close with someone).

Someone I\u2019m close to recently lost a bunch of weight and everyone keeps telling her well done and she looks great - she lost it because someone she loved died and the trauma threw her right back into an eating disorder. Many years ago I also had people telling me how great I looked because I lost weight. I had cancer.\n\nMy point is - she went about it in a slightly obnoxious way but she\u2019s also not wrong about the \u2018don\u2019t comment on people\u2019s weight\u2019 thing.", "NTA. \"Since it was said to me, I believe *I'm* the person who should judge whether it's okay or not.\"", "NTA.

Her jealousy seems to be manifesting as anger.", "NTA \n\nSerena sounds like she's bitter.", "almost nah if Serena and her friend let it go.

But because they keep harassing you, nta.", "NTA because I\u2019m assuming that because Derek is a friend he understands the context of your weight loss. His comment was less about your appearance and more about you looking and feeling healthier.\n\nThese sorts of comments without context are what can be problematic. A weight change in itself is neither good nor bad - the reasoning matters. \n\nSociety has an unhealthy habit of assuming all weight loss is good and all weight gain is bad. People also tend to ignore the reasoning behind weight change and focus on subjective opinions on appearance. \n\nI know people who hated when people complimented them on losing weight and told them how good they looked because the weight loss was due to cancer. I know others who were so proud of getting sober and being healthier than ever but all people would comment on is their weight gain.\n\nWanting people to reconfigure how they view weight changes isn\u2019t about insecurity. It\u2019s about trying to get people to view weight and appearance in a healthier, more holistic way.", "NTA, Derrick's comment was to you, not to the others.  My guess is there is some jealousy in regards to you being noticed.  The fact you are still experiencing the harassment tells me the ones continuing to comment on the appropriateness are the true assh\\*les.", "NTA. I made a lot of effort to get healthy and it felt great when people I cared about noticed. I also understand not everyone feels that way and make similar accommodations to folks who are triggered by those sort of comments about their weight.\n\nBut I think it is reasonable to not cater to your friend\u2019s insecurities to the point you have to deny yourself validation so they can feel good.", "Do I wish that people in general would just stop commenting on other people's bodies?

But when she texted you and insulted you, that moved this from a triggering type of situation to her just taking out her anger on you \n\nWhich is not cool", "Derek gave you a compliments.  You thanked him for it.\n\nYou were polite.  You responded in an appropriate manner.\n\nBe grateful Serena is not longer in your friend group.\n\nNTA", "The fact that Serena and her friend have been harassing OP since this interaction tells me this isn\u2019t about Derek\u2019s comment as much as looking for an excuse to rag on someone they don\u2019t like. Which is an AH thing to do, obviously.", " why do you think it was an inappropriate comment?", "So if someone was being bullied or insulted about thier weight it would be wrong for someone else to call out the bully because you can't police what someone says about anyone else's weight?\nSerena was clearly wrong I'm this case but I don't think your generalisation stands.", "It's also rude to point out weight LOSS as it can frequently be due to an illness.", "What?

But even if she was trying to educate this point and she HAD to scold someone she should scold Derek not the person who received a compliment.

I do just think it's worth taking into account that disordered eating can go in the complete opposite direction as well, probably far more frequently, and people struggling on that side of the fight deserves support and encouragement too. It can have a similar effect of 'no one is noticing so why bother'. It's a nuanced topic and  'never comment on someone else's body' doesn't do it justice. It's the equivalent of telling kids never to cross the road instead of teaching them how to observe and cross safely.

I hate it when people get outraged on others behalf, when the other is perfectly fine and isn't outraged.", "If you know someone is actively trying to lose weight, commenting on their effort and congratulating them is one thing, but if you just notice someone lost weight it can be rude to mention it. It\u2019s not always intentional when someone loses weight, it can be an underlying health problem and pointing out the change can be upsetting.

Serena needs to worry about herself. It's *hard* to lose weight so I'm of the opinion that when someone compliments weight loss, what they're really doing is acknowledging the work that goes into it.

I think it is very bad manners, in addition to being a very personal pain point for me. So I agree with Serena, but once OP said it was all good she should have dropped it.
