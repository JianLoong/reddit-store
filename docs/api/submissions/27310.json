Something happens to others\u2019 kids and you\u2019re not supervising, they may hand you the bill. Fence up, maybe lawyer up.", "They could sue you for the medical bills but also continue to sue you in the future for \u201cpsychological suffering\u201d. No no no. Make sure you save the texts. Put up a fence.", "LOL.  I love that image. My neighbour's kid has several battery operated vehicles. If a tank were available, his dad would get him one. And he would try to drive it through my hawthorne hedge.", "No trespassing signs would do nothing in the event the kids did trespass, has no legal value, if they get injured it's still the owners fault", "I like the idea of firing off a LOUD horn every time the kids show.", "Imagine blaming property owners because someone trespassed onto private property. This type of law HAD to be drafted by negligent parents that refuse to take responsibility for their children.", "Thank you for reminding me I need to go out and post my property line.", "There's some method to the madness, and it's a pretty well-established liability practice.\n\nThe basic logic is:\n\n* \"You knew you had something on your property that would attract minors.\n* Under the law that creates a duty to take reasonable care to prevent injury that might occur as a result of that attraction.\n* If you failed to secure the attraction against unauthorized/unsupervised access to a *reasonable* extent, you bear some responsibility for any resulting injuries.\"\n\nUsually something as simple as a fence around your yard, or around the swimming pool is sufficient. If the kids get in *in spite of* the measures you took to secure it, then it's not really on you anymore.\n\nI work for an insurance company, and in some states, our insurance guidelines won't allow us to write for a home with an unsecured nuisance (in some cases, they even specifically call out trampolines if the yard is unfenced and swimming pools that don't have their own fencing), *specifically* because homeowners insurance includes liability coverage that the company would have to pay the claim for if something went down (including costs to defend the suit in some cases).\n\nAlso, as a homeowner and a guy with an insurance license, I understand like never before why having an \"excess liability/Personal Umbrella Policy\" is important. If the cost of a claim exceeds the $100k or so on your HO policy, you're on the hook for the rest. If you don't have the cash, you can lose your other assets... like your house.", "They didn't hit the kid. They moved their car to their driveway and were working in their garage and the kid hit the car with their bike. What sort of person do you think I am that I'd be fine with a person hitting a kid with their car???", "I think posting no trespassing signs is questionable advice. I think that\u2019s acknowledging dangers, which is admission of fault in a lawsuit.", "We had to deal with this because the neighbors put up an \u201cattractive nuisance\u201d (two pieces of play equipment) for their kids on what turned out to be our yard. Though we won\u2019t ever use that part of our yard, lawyer said we had to ask them to take it down to avoid liability in case of injury. They were really mad about it but we didn\u2019t have a choice.", "It's such bullshit that this country protects idiots.", ">If your state has an attractive nuisance doctrine, then kids injured on your property are your liability.\n\nOnly if there is something that makes it an attractive nuisance.  Nothing about the comment you're replying to suggests they have an attractive nuisance.\n\nAs of a couple of years ago, about 15 states maintained some version of the doctrine.", "We had armed men walk out of the woods into our back yard when we were *little* kids on multiple occasions. Couldn\u2019t wear those white mittens Grandma made anywhere but church.", "Ugh, I feel this. We used to live on 60 acres in Central Minnesota and the amount of hunters who would try to tell my mom \"uh yeah the pheasant we shot flew from where we were hunting over onto your land and we were just scooching on in to grab it\" was insane. Sir, first, you shouldn't be hunting over in the other field either, and second, you are 200 yards deep into land explicitly set aside for native prairie and wildlife with *many* clearly posted no trespassing and no hunting signs. You made a very intentional decision to be here and kept making it.", "Yeah there's a guy in the area who had several cows shot \"mistaken for deer\"\n\nPeople suck.", "my sister, who gets poison ivy just from looking at it recommends washing the area with the hottest water you can stand and blue Dawn dishwashing liquid.  Avoid creams and ointments because you need to dry out the lesions and they keep them moist.  \n\nAlso, she recommends pouring straight rubbing alcohol on it and letting it air dry.", "I had a bad case of poison ivy that nothing seemed to work on.

I used it twice a day and found almost immediate relief.", "Shower or bathe at least twice a day! It will help keep the itching down and heal the blisters. Cool water (not hot) is best!", "That stuff spreads everywhere.", "Ok something might attract minors, but other than sometimes picking an errant pretty flower close to the sidewalk, my parents taught me better than to use other people's things... now I am 41 and things were a little different when I was little, but unless you are letting a 4 year old out unsupervised they should know better.", "Legally, the sign still protects you. Apparently, the law doesn't follow common sense.", "A \"No Trespassing\" sign does *not* acknowledge any danger and may even help in a lawsuit since the plaintiff knowingly went where they weren't allowed to.", "\"neighbor's play stuff\"", "Yeah, growing up we had 50 acres behind our house, forest and field. Hunters would ignore or tear down no trespassing signs (because if the signs were down the police wouldn\u2019t do a thing).

You just have to know which kind to plant. \n\nSpreading bamboo is the devil."]}
