Our family has always been close, and I've been financially successful. My brother and his fianc\u00e9e (27F) asked if I could help pay for their wedding, and I agreed because I love them both and want them to have a great day.\n\nMy wife (31F) and I have been married for 5 years now. We've been trying for a baby for 3 years, but we recently found out that my wife is infertile. It's been a very emotional and difficult time for us, but we're considering adoption or other options.\n\nHere's where the issue comes in: my brother's fianc\u00e9e is very family-oriented and has always dreamt of having a big family. When she found out about my wife's infertility, she was initially sympathetic. However, she later decided that my wife's infertility was \"bad luck\" and might \"rub off\" on her if my wife attended their wedding. As a result, she uninvited my wife from the wedding.\n\nWhen I found out, I was furious. I told my brother that if my wife isn't welcome, then I won't be attending either. Furthermore, I said I'd be withdrawing my financial support for their wedding. He called me an asshole, saying that I'm ruining his big day and being selfish. He also argued that it's just one day and my wife will get over it.\n\nI'm really torn up about this because I love my brother, but I feel like I need to stand up for my wife.

Our family has always been close, and I've been financially successful. My brother and his fianc\u00e9e (27F) asked if I could help pay for their wedding, and I agreed because I love them both and want them to have a great day.\n\nMy wife (31F) and I have been married for 5 years now. We've been trying for a baby for 3 years, but we recently found out that my wife is infertile. It's been a very emotional and difficult time for us, but we're considering adoption or other options.\n\nHere's where the issue comes in: my brother's fianc\u00e9e is very family-oriented and has always dreamt of having a big family. When she found out about my wife's infertility, she was initially sympathetic. However, she later decided that my wife's infertility was \"bad luck\" and might \"rub off\" on her if my wife attended their wedding. As a result, she uninvited my wife from the wedding.\n\nWhen I found out, I was furious. I told my brother that if my wife isn't welcome, then I won't be attending either. Furthermore, I said I'd be withdrawing my financial support for their wedding. He called me an asshole, saying that I'm ruining his big day and being selfish. He also argued that it's just one day and my wife will get over it.\n\nI'm really torn up about this because I love my brother, but I feel like I need to stand up for my wife. AITA for refusing to pay for my brother's wedding after he uninvited my wife because she's infertile?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. You would be the asshole to still pay for the wedding.

I can\u2019t imagine trying to forgive someone for kicking me when I\u2019m down like SIL is doing.", "Love it! OP, please do this. \n\nNTA for sure, but this is so clear-cut that I\u2019m worried about you being torn over it. I\u2019m going to chalk it up to the utter shock and devastation of just discovering that your brother and his fianc\u00e9e are stupid, cruel, and entitled people. \n\nTake the money you were going to use for this wedding and put it toward adoption costs/treatments/surrogate/therapy (actually, do the last one regardless. Infertility is incredibly painful for both of you). And first, maybe take some of that money and do something nice for yourselves on their wedding day.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this on top of the infertility news. Best wishes for you both!!", "Agree.", "fr, i couldnt get thru it without thinking \"this isnt real\"", "NTA save your money for adoption or a surrogate especially because being childless is such a problem for them. They should not want you to spend money that you could use getting a child on a party that only lasts one day.", "Right!? She may need to contact all her guests to verify their fertility before the big day. /s", "LOL - This is the best comment!", "Perfect!", "The same people who think sitting on a toilet seat will get you pregnant. OP is definitely NTA. Brother and FSIL are absolutely TA.", "I\u2019m wondering if she/they are from a culture where superstitions are very prevalent. That is certainly no excuse for such abhorrent behavior by the SIL to be, but I cannot possibly imagine why anyone would believe such a thing.\nNTA and I would say you are not enough of an a-hole in this scenario.", "Way too many AITA posts are about weddings. People lose their minds when it comes to weddings and pregnancies.", "His brother is absolutely an asshole. What kind of brother who's having his wedding paid for would allow their wife to be to make a demand like that. Total asshole and I'd really like to say worse about the brother", "But he probably won\u2019t get over how awful his brother and his wife are", "And stupid, to boot! What kind of moron believes infertility is contagious???", "Yes to everything here! \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "This was absolutely my reaction too: Holy cow and WTF! \n\nInfertility is \"bad luck\" and \"might rub off on her\"? You absolutely shouldn't finance the wedding, and if your brother can't understand how incredibly rude it is to uninvite your wife he needs some serious self reflection. \n\nNTA, 100%", "I agree and I can guarantee you that karma will hit the future SIL", "It\u2019s also not contagious. \n\nNTA.", "This entire post is simply not true.", "All of this.", "Agreed. \nI say NTA but if I were your wife, i\u2019d be extremely disappointed if I found out what you\u2019re asking here on Reddit. \nHope you never tell her and immediately take action on your brother and future SIL.", "How are you answering this is complete good fault as though it\u2019s a legitimate post? I\u2019m genuinely curious: did you believe the events in this post actually happened?", "Fantastic idea", "I agree with this, take your wife on an amazing trip. Call it a second honeymoon", "But who is waiting for the one person to tell op he is ta because he promised. And that his brother is family and family does for family and some other bull shit!", "OP should stay away just in case stupidity is contagious because it looks like his brother already caught it.", "There are so many stupid people out there. It's terrifying.", "Yes, since she's so superstitious, then she probably shouldn't want OP's cursed infertility money either.", "I had to read the whole thing because I thought the title must have been misleading or exaggerated. But no.", "100% was coming to mention the karmic justice that would be lol like damn, nta op but your brother and certainly the FSIL is \ud83d\ude24", "You beat me to it. NTA. What a bunch of selfish pricks.", "Doubtful", "He has spoken.", "This is the way", "Well said.", "If it was I\u2019d constantly cozy up to infertile people. ;)", "Take the money aside for adoption or other children related expenses you might need! I have 2 under 2 both are premature and require more than just \u201cI fed them and they see the doctor for shots that\u2019s it, ya know the regular \u201c you don\u2019t EXPECT AND PLAN for the shit that may happen you could adopt a newborn with no known issues and then suddenly they aren\u2019t eating aren\u2019t gaining weight and they are delayed for unknown reasons! Most people are going to struggle to afford several therapies to support a child that isn\u2019t perfectly healthy and fit at all points in early childhood\u2026. No illnesses I wish upon them but it\u2019s the reality of life sometimes and a good backup plan is a fantastic start in case, even healthy babies need soooo much stuff! They may not understand how you dump 1,000s in the first year yet! We sure weren\u2019t expecting alll they need and want, who thinks their 3-4mo is too big for the bucket seat, ain\u2019t it suppose to last a year?! Apparently it happens sometimes \ud83d\ude02", "They're kind of tedious... \"WIBTA if I [insert drama].\"", "Yep, the whole \"rubbing off\" thing doesn't make sense to me, I wonder where that logic comes from?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I've come back to this post and am realizing it sounds a little rude. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at conveying tone/emotion online.", "Of course there are stupid people out there but my god don\u2019t pick THIS as the story to defend. It\u2019s literally a trope is so ridiculous.", "Bet the bride doesn\u2019t want anyone focusing on anyone but her and she wants OP\u2019s wife out of the way. What she doesn\u2019t realize is it will cause more commotion if she isn\u2019t there and everyone is asking why."]}
