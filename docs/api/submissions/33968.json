To make things easier,  I cleared out the top shelf of the cupboard for them and bought several boxes with lids that click into place.  When they arrived,  I reminded them again.

I said the dog DID eat my boots (although mine weren't $650), and I changed my behaviour to avoid it from happening again.

That was a choice, because you gave him enough warning about your puppy. Some people can only be helped so many times and then they have to pull up their big adult pants and be responsible for their own choices.

You gave fair warning.\n\nI had a similar situation with a roommate years ago. Before she moved in, I explained to her that nothing can be left out around my one dog who gets into everything. I reminded her several times to pick up after herself. I moved her things out of shared spaces and up and away from my dog many times. She once left a pair of glasses on a side table and my dog chewed the ear piece . She was pissed and told me I needed to replace them. All I said was that I gave her enough warnings and she didn\u2019t take them seriously. \n\nThe problem in this situation is that your puppy could ingest something harmful that causes serious issues like an obstruction. They may be mad that you won\u2019t replace the boots. I\u2019d be mad they didn\u2019t listen and left them out for my dog to access.", "NTA.

This is the first post of this kind I can remember saying this - typically you\u2019re always responsible for whatever your child or dog ruins - regardless of the price.  But you not only warned them, but even provided them with alternative places to store their belongings.  They failed to do so.  Since you warned them of the danger, yet they still failed to protect their belongings, they & only they are responsible for the damage that you point blank told them would occur if they failed to do so.  NTA.", "NTA. Usually, I think people should be responsible for things that their child/pet/or they themselves destroy, but you gave them many warnings/reminders and provided safe places for their things. This was an avoidable situation that they chose to be lazy and ignore.", "100% NTA.  You warned them not to even stay with you and, when they insisted, you warned them in great detail about the puppy and yet your BIL still did something stupid. Stand your ground because you are absolutely in the right here.", "This the call for you to pay the puppy tax.", "NTA\nYou gave fair warning even provided them adequate storage to keep their things safe the moment you said it became their responsibility to take necessary measures to keep them safe from harm.\n\nThey are not children you are not their mommy they left stuff out it got chewed despite two warnings now they have to deal with it like adults instead of blaming someone else.", "NTA. You covered all your bases. And my first thought is that the BIL already damaged his boots, and used your puppy to damage them more in order to get someone else to buy a replacement pair", "NTA\n\nThey were warned, you made accommodations for them and they didn't listen or they forgot. It's odd how expensive boots weren't seen as something to guard from the puppy. \n\n\nI'd tell my husband that if he pulls money from the joint account to pay for the boots, I'd not be contributing to the joint account again.", "NTA\n\nThey are idiots. Its that simple really.\nA puppy is a puppy. You dont want them to chew on something you make damn sure you don't leave it where they'll pick it up, worse again when they are teething.\n\nThey raise it again for you to pay just laugh and tell them to GTFO of your home. Idiots.", "NTA\n\nYour puppy was being a puppy, and Kevin needs to learn to take care of his stuff and take warnings seriously.", "I was definitely going to vote the other way looking at the title but in these circumstances NTA\n\nThey basically insisted on staying even though you said no initially. You went to a lot of trouble clearing a shelf, getting boxer with lids & emphasising leave the door closed.\n\nKevin disregarded  your instructions especially NOT to leave stuff on the floor. \n\nReplacing the boots is on him.", "NTA \u2026 you were very clear. Who leaves an expensive pair of RMs around with a puppy (holy moly, I didn\u2019t know they had become that expensive these days!)?", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA. You very specifically warned them. You told them \"if you do X, Y will happen.\" They did X, Y happened.\n\nYou went completely out of your way to accommodate them. You were reluctant, you let them know why. And here's the most important part: *they took on the risk*. You told them staying with you meant that the dog may destroy their belongings. They decided to stay. That means that they accepted the risk. \n\nYou owe them nothing.", "The grown adult couldn't put his damn boots away and it's your fault? You provided multiple options so this wouldn't happen but he was too lazy to do any of that so it's your fault? Did I get all that correct? That's ridiculous he should have picked his crap above the damn floor or deal with the consequences. NTA.", "Normally, I'd say it's your dog and your responsibility, but in this situation NTA.  He practically forced his way in and then completely disregarded the instructions about leaving things out.  You even went out of your way to make it easier on him.  You gave warnings multiple times and rearranged it so he could properly store things so they don't get ruined.  The only thing you didn't do that I would have was say \"if he chews your stuff, it's on you, not me.\"\n\nHe's a grown ass man capable of remembering simple instructions.  Especially when he's pushing to stay with you to instead of a hotel.  Sorry, not sorry, but if something was important to him, he shouldn't be leaving it in the middle of the floor with a puppy known for chewing.  Especially not after the warnings, after pushing to stay there and all that.\n\nYour husband is also owner of the dog, so if he thinks it should be paid back, let him do it.", "Were the boots even his size? Did they find a pair of weird sized boots on clearance and leave them out to get munched up? The whole thing seems fishy to me. NTA.", "NTA for all the reasons everyone has said.\n\nShould have called the puppy \u201cCheddar\u201d for the purposes of the story though.\n\n(Although Cheddar would NEVER)", ">Your husband is also owner of the dog, so if he thinks it should be paid back, let him do it.\n\nThis only applies if they have separate finances or something, otherwise, he'd still be using up her money.", "NTA for the boots, but a crate and a house line on the dog resolves the issues. The dogs clearly bored and given too much freedom. If you aren\u2019t actively interacting with the puppy or keeping an eye on them they should be in a crate. They can\u2019t get into things they shouldn\u2019t, this prevents you from getting your dogs stomach pumped. Just fucking lazy", "She says it's coming from the joint account, implying that they have separate accounts."]}
