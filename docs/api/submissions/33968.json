{"id": 33968, "submission_id": "18tkqt0", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for the expensive boots my puppy ate?", "selftext": "We (M & F, 50's) have a nine month old puppy. I've struggled to train him,  and hired a professional trainer to help us out.  Even so, he does puppy things like chewing anything he can find that looks interesting. He has lots of specific dog toys, but they're clearly not as well designed at all the human-owned things that are so much more desirable to his puppy brain.\n\nOver Xmas, my brother \"Ray\" (37) and his husband \"Kevin\" (50) wanted to stay with us.  I refused at first,  but finally agreesmd because accommodation is insanely expensive in the summer holidays.   Before I agreed, I gave them the full run-down on the puppy's behaviour. I told them they can't leave anything on the floor,  and the door to their bedroom has to be shut whenever they're not there. To make things easier,  I cleared out the top shelf of the cupboard for them and bought several boxes with lids that click into place.  When they arrived,  I reminded them again.  My point was demonstrated when the puppy came trotting out to greet them with a pair of safety goggles in his mouth.  I didn't even know I owned safety goggles and have no idea where they could have come from.  Maybe he convinced a passing tradie to throw them over the fence to him?\n\nAnyway,  Kevin bought a new pair of RM Williams boots. He left the box on the floor of the living room,  and the puppy devoured them. He's demanding I pay to replace them, because it was my dog that destroyed them.  I'm refusing, because I gave him fair warning and provided a secure place to store anything he didn't want chewed up.  They also insisted on staying here, claiming they couldn't afford accommodation,  but I pointed out that if Kevin can afford $650 for boots, he can afford a couple of nights in a local hotel. I think in in the right,  but my husband thinks I should pay.  He said I'd be upset if the dog ate my boots. I said the dog DID eat my boots (although mine weren't $650), and I changed my behaviour to avoid it from happening again.  Husband says it's not fair to expect people to remember, but I think that's a silly argument and said if be really thinks we should pay,  the money will come out of our joint account.  Now he's sitting in the living room with Kevin and they're both sulking. AITA?\n\nEdit for further context: This blew up a bit over night so I thought I'd add a bit more information.\n\nThe puppy is crate trained and responds to his commands about 90% of the time.  The living room the boots were left in was upstairs. The puppy is not allowed up there,  and there is a gate at the bottom of the stairs that Kevin constantly left open, despite me reminding him to keep it closed AND putting a sign up that says 'SHUT THE GATE'.\n\nHowever. I do not like Kevin, and I put up with him for my brother's sake. When reflecting on everything,  I asked myself would I replace the boots if it was anyone else. And I might, BUT I don't know anyone else that would stay at my place that would be so....oblivious to the precautions needed to protect their belongings. My sister and her spouse and kids stayed earlier in the year,  and one of the kids left their skechers on the floor in the downstairs loungeroom. The dog ate them and I offered to replace those, but my sister refused because the kids (15, 17, 19) are old enough to take responsibility and had been warned not to leave things lying around.   And that was at the time before the trainer had been engaged and the puppy was just a ball of undirected destructive chaos energy.\n\nI also sent them a text before agreeing to allow them to stay that said 'Dudes, the risk is yours. If the dog eats your expwnsive toys, that's on you.  You have been warned.\"", "created_utc": 1703848090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tkqt0/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_the_expensive_boots/", "score": 2012, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I refused at first, but finally agreesmd because accommodation is insanely expensive in the summer holidays. Before I agreed, I gave them the full run-down on the puppy's behaviour. I told them they can't leave anything on the floor, and the door to their bedroom has to be shut whenever they're not there. To make things easier, I cleared out the top shelf of the cupboard for them and bought several boxes with lids that click into place. When they arrived, I reminded them again. \n\nNTA\n\nThey insisted on staying with you because they were too \"cheap\" to pay for accommodation,  but had $650 boots.

Your husband is \"sulking\" w Kevin?  WTF?\n\n\nJust need to say this.... \n\n\n>We (M & F, 50's) have a nine month old puppy. I've struggled to train him, and hired a professional trainer to help us out. Even so, he does puppy things like chewing anything he can find that looks interesting. He has lots of specific dog toys, but they're clearly not as well designed at all the human-owned things that are so much more desirable to his puppy brain.\n\n\nUm, he's a puppy/juvenile.  This is typical behavior. You didn't state the breed, but there are chewers & then heavy chewers.  \n\nA \"professional trainer\" won't stop his behavior, but a good one will teach YOU why he's appropriately behaving like this & help to minimize by redirection & LOTS of energy draining activities.  \n\nHe prefers people stuff because of the scents. Sit with those toys up against you.  (Might work too encased with a freshly worn shirt or blanket). They'll absorb scent which will provide a sense of comfort.  \n\n You can also \"hide\" chew toys  where he can make a discovery. Make a big deal of the *joy* when he shows you. \n\n\nIf pup discovers something unique (like the goggles), humans turn it into a \"game\"to get it away\n - bonus win for puppy becoming the center of attention.  \n\nI highly recommend teaching pup to *make trade* and you can use that exact phrase. \n\n\nHave some small treats at the ready in a pocket or in a small jar.  Lay some enticing non-acceptable, but safe items around the room.  When he picks one up, tell him *make trade* - show the treat & switch the item over with it.\n\n You can also use a special favored toy, especially after he learns the exchange. It's also a good \"safety lesson\" for the future. \n\n\n\nI've trained my dogs with this for years.  Lately, my senior 15 year old dachs has decided to revisit her youth to scour the house for mysterious stuff. I can  see her joy at being the center of attention for finding socks & paper & writing utensils.  She gets a single *make trade* per day & she is utterly thrilled.  If she keeps pulling out items from  nowhere, she gets her \"egg\".  It's one of those toy balls that rolls & dispenses tiny treats.  It keeps her busy for an hour. Then she's tired for a nap. \n\n\nGood luck with your pup. Enjoy the \"teenage\" stage that not too many talk about.  It's when all the wonderful obedient puppy education goes out the window & its that awkward mystifying \"what in the world\" emerges, just like in humans. \n\n\nWhen Your Dog Is a Teenager\n https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/17/opinion/dogs-puppies-adolescence.html?smid=nytcore-android-share", "NTA\n\nFk, I hate people.

My dogs live here. Visitors do not. \nI will not put my dog in any position that makes it uncomfortable, or otherwise limits its ability to interact within my house the way they normally do, for the sake of someone who wants a free place to crash. \n\nOf course, I teach them manners, and I they all know how to ask permission to interact with people in different ways, but that's a process and varies by age and by dog. \n\nEvery single person that enters my home, gets a speech about appropriate behavior around my dogs. What they may and may not do in relation to the dogs, how they are permitted to express their boundaries, and what to do with belongings etc. \n\nIf they don't want to have that discussion, they don't need to be in my home.

I'd go so far as to make it clear to your husband that not only are you not paying for them, he is not paying for it either. \n\nI'd also be advising your brother that he has put your dog at risk and is no longer welcome to stay in your home. You went out of your way to accommodate him, you even bought items to make that job easier. \n\nMake no mistake, he chose this. He may not have expected to have the boots destroyed, maybe thought the box would get chewed, but I don't doubt this was a case of \"I'm not modifying everything I do for a dog, if the dog destroys my stuff, she's gonna pay for it\".\n\nHe sounds like he's been nothing but a nuisance and hostile, you've tried to be nice and accommodating, time to put your foot down. \n\nAlso, I'm going to send you a PM with a little bit of info on the ingestion of leather and what to look out for.

It's Kevin's fault for not being responsible for his things. I not only work with dogs, but my puppy broke my glasses twice last year, so I know the pain of having a pooch destroy expensive things. Yes I was upset, very upset, but I was still able to acknowledge my part in the incidents (okay the first one was an accidental headbutt but the second one was my fault), I shouldn't have left my glasses where my puppy could reach them, knowing she liked to chew things and liked to grab things that smelled heavily of my or my mom's scent. Of course she would go for something that sat on my face everyday!\n\nIt's clear tho that full on refusing to pay could hinder your relationship with Kevin and your brother. You can absolutely stick to your guns and refuse but if you don't want to risk your relationship with them, it may be best to offer to cover half, or even a third of the cost.

I've raised two dogs and one of them was not destructive at all so she had free reign of the house from the time she was little. The other was not allowed to free  roam until she learned several commands like \"drop it\" and \"stop\" and soon she correlated and didn't chew things other than her own toys. If your dog is that destructive she should have a gated area to play in that is safe + you as the owner should be making sure that the area is free from damageable items consistently. Like say if that were my dog and the safe area was the living room - you'd bet your behind I'd be checking before letting her out to roam that the entire livingroom was gated + nothing I cared about could be destroyed in it. It's proper dog ownership.\n\nBut regardless, it was your animal so you're the one at fault.

Not to mention you warned them several times to keep their belongings in their designated room and preferably out of puppy's reach. \n\nAs someone who has had houseguests invite themselves to stay and then proceeded to leave their shit all over my house, I say tough luck to Kevin and his overpriced boots. It was rude of them to basically push their way into your home just to save a few bucks and then worse, leave their crap everywhere. \n\nPS.

But if you are sure it was Kevin who left the gate open, then you need to point that fact out.\n\nI don't get why your husband is sulking.  He disagrees with you, voiced his disagreement, and you accepted his opinion and offered to jointly share in the expense.  Both seem very childish.  Husband is pretty free with his opinion when its your money.\n\nNext time they ask to stay, say no.  When asked why, tell your brother that Kevin is not very respectful of you and your home.

He now understands FAFO", "Yeah it sounds to me a bit like the guy deliberately left the boots in reach of the puppy, maybe because he didn't like them anymore but couldn't get a refund and this puppy chewing everything seemed like just the right solution lol....", "The grown ass adult who was given a place to put his boots shouldn't have left him in the middle of the floor", "You looking for something to be triggered about?", "Unless you're expected to pay for stupidity.

Kevin should be embarrassed and never have asked for compensation in the first place.", "Neither would Cheddar.  She's not just some basic bitch.", "RM Williams boots are the quintessential 'man on the land' shoes.  Not that I know any actual farmwrs that own them. I mean, who spends that sort of money on boots that are going to be tracked through cow poo, mud, dead sheep, creeks etc? They are great boots - I've owned a couple of pairs in my lifetime and they were the most comfortable,  supportive boots ever,  but they were hand me downs.  I think Kevin thinks they make him seem more Australian, maybe? (he's originally from another country). I don't know what's going on in his head.  He's just a wanker. He also drives one of those RAM utes with all the accessories but lives in Newtown (Sydney).", "I feel like it\u2019s the same as if they\u2019d stayed in a hotel, and he\u2019d left the expensive boots in the lobby. \u201cWhere are my boots, I left them on the floor last night?\u201d  \u201cUm, sir, in your room?  Do you think a hotel employee took or moved them?\u201d \u201cNo, my expensive boots, I left them here in the lobby on the floor and now they\u2019re gone?\u201d  \u201cSir the lobby is a public space, we are not responsible for your boots.\u201d", "I was also ready to vote they pay, but they went out of their way to avoid this very situation and the 50 year old man couldn't be bothered to even put it up off the floor. That is on him. \n\nI do wonder the type of puppy. I have an Australian shepherd (Ausshole) and we gave him the job of recycling cardboard and helping us open packages and gifts (under supervirion of course) and have had only a few instances of him eating something he shouldn't. Certain breeds need more than just toys to occupy them. Puzzles and even some baby toys also help. Soft balls with tags and rattles inside are a favorite as are tissue boxes with fabric handkerchiefs. There is a soft box version that they couldnt get enough of as its destruction without destroying. He is also teaching our 9 month old Pomtese puppy what is ok and not to chew on with this method. We still puppy proof and understand if it's on the ground they may eat it and that is on us.", "I agree. The instructions were clear and simple.

He could have gotten seriously ill from eating those boots.", "I second this motion!", "Yup. From the title I was expecting that OP would obviously be TA, but she clearly isn\u2019t after reading the details. They were given fair warning of what would happen to their belongings if they were not properly secured. It wasn\u2019t a random unexpected accident.

Shameful.", "This is where I feel I'm leaning into arsehole territory. I DO NOT like Kevin. He's rude, arrogant and entitled. He's also independently wealthy, so they could have afforded a hotel but he was too tight to come up with the cash. If this had happened to my sister's husband,  I probably would have been more willing to pay for the boots, but it's a moot point. Sis and her hubs just wouldn't have behaved the same way,  and they certainly wouldn't have paid $650 for boots. If it was their stuff,  they would have laughed about it and blame themselves for their actions.", "I don't know how to put a picture on Reddit.

He responds to his commands about 90% of the time these days.  He know sit, drop, stay, to me, come by, walk and heel. He is normally confined to particular parts of the house,  but Kevin left the gate to the upstairs open EVEN THOUGH I'd reminded him several times to make sure it was shut. Apart from telling them not to come,  I'm not sure what else I could have done. Kevin is an adult,  with all the tools available to look after his own things, yet he chose not to. I'm not responsible for Kevin's foolish decisions, regardless if whether it's my dog and my house.  He has to take responsibility for ignoring every single precaution put in place.", "They left boots in a place they were told not to leave them, in a place they did not have permision to leave them in, and where they knew the dog would get into them. \n\nThis is like touching fire after being told- repeatedly- not to touch fire because fire is hot and will burn. You should already know better- fire burns, puppy chew- but even if you didn't you were warned.", "I'm so sorry! I hope your doggo recovered well. That sort of carelessness is inexcusable.", "Yes.

I'm hoping they'll leave today.", "It\u2019s the dogs house. It doesn\u2019t have to be supervised 24/7.

I have spent hours googling and you've summed everything up in a few paragraphs! I appreciate it! Our pup is an English Cocker Spaniel, so he's very motivated by scent. Each day,  I get some meat on a string and drag it around the yard and hide it for him. He'a still at that age where he frolics, so watching him prance around the yard, following the scent is really funny.  Plus he gets so excited when he finds his reward.", "\"Make trade\" is genius.", "Man, this was a FANTASTIC comment. \n\nOh, how I miss awards.

When I've got a spare minute, I'll google instructions and see what I can do.", "You're probably more than welcome to pay for these boots if you would like to.\n\nThe thing is; they were warned multiple times that this might happen, there was space cleared so that they could keep their stuff safe and there's a damn gate on the stairs to stop the dog from going upstairs but Kevin seems to be incapable of closing it despite the OP putting a sign up on it as a reminder to shut the gate.  \n\nThere is literally nothing more the OP could've done expect not have her brother and his husband there at all... yes even visiting because they'd probably visit and bring the boots they just bought and have the same outcome.\n\nThis really looks like a case of weaponised incompetence.  Kevin either has ADHD (probably not) or thinks that he can do whatever he likes with no consequence to him.", "I spend way too much time in Airds of Lochinvar (a speciality store ib the NSW Hunter Valley that sells all things \"country\"). The boots are as expensive as he says they are.", "Can you not read? They are training their dog. Dogs don\u2019t learn overnight. The guests were provided things to protect their property.

I know quite a few people who would use this opportunity if they could.", "Right. Why would the husband be siding with him, that part makes no sense.", "That's my thinking as well", "Nope, just wondering.

He wasn't even always attached to me but it was perfect for redirection when necessary.", "Husband was all for OP paying for the shoes themselves until they said it would be from the joint account if they did.\n\nSo they have separate accounts with presumably enough to cover an expense like that. \n\nHusband wanted her to pay for the shoes by herself, for something their shared puppy did, that she told the guests would be likely if they left something out.

He SHOULD be on your side on this given you aren't in the wrong at all.

Giving in just enables their incredibly entitled behavior.", "What in earth is up with your husband? Is he having an affair with Kevin or something? He seems mighty keen to be hosting this jerk AND handing out joint account money to him. \n\nDoesn't your husband like your dog? Does he hate the distructiveness? Does he not like YOU? Something is off balance here and it feels more important than the boots. \n\nNTA -- you gave fair warning, and they could have stayed at an hotel or simply been careful.", "Yes, this is absolutely true. You should expect an adult to be able to listen to directions and follow them. \n\nBut by law, the owner of the dog would be liable. \"Dogs destroying stuff\" has been a problem for a long time and there are laws on the book about it. If OP was taken to court and laid this out in front of a judge, most judges would decide against her.", "Yeah he's on the mend. It was very scary at the time.

She was... intense.  Kudos to you. \n\nOh, I knew several  different families who had English cockers about 20 years ago.  The stories they told were funny and made me realize it was a strong never for me, lol.  They're lovely dogs, but most seem to take a much larger breed's typical slow path to maturity. \n\n\nI had a very sweet natured, smart, & sensitive (American) Cocker /chihuahua crossbreed.  The chihuahua dna took out the spaniel broad features.  She looked like a small black sight hound, but smaller. 17lbs muscled.   Very lean, leggy with a deep chest. A fast runner.   But she'd point on pheasant when we were out walking in woods.  Excellent & soft retrieving skills. Easiest dog i ever had, to train & trust off leash.  \n\nFor a time, we lived in very open countryside & I'd send her to fetch our other dog, who was a darling numbskull.  (She'd follow her nose when we were on walks & lose track of us).\nThey'd be out in the distance 1/4-1/2 a mile away where voice & whistle were useless, so I used hand signals to direct her. Incredible pup.  That's something that might work with yours (hand signals)\n\n\nShe was never a chewer for some reason.  Her only toy she had interest in was a fleece ball she had from puppy to 13 years old. Her buddy would take it away. She'd look mournfully at me & her ball until I got it back to her.  I had it cremated with her so she can have it with her forever.", "I would love to observe that as a neighbor! Not being sarcastic in the slightest. It would be cute to watch the dog parent go to all that trouble, and then watch the pup enjoy the hunt.", "Lol this dog was a Bichon mix", "Unfortunately, I can read. At 9 months, a puppy shouldn't still be chewing everything in sight and obviously whatever training they are supposedly doing isn't working.", "OP was just posting the facts, I don't see what there is in the post that gives you vibes of \"veiled and mild disdain\"? OP just gave the facts about who the post was about with no judgment about their age or sexuality. Why are you seeing it here? Hmm. If it had been \"brother (31m) and his wife (30f) and the exact same story would that have read differently to you?

Don't pay attention, receive consequences.", "That's a great way to describe it! I've never heard that term before,  but it fits him to a tee.

He said he knew how to shear....it did not end well for him.", "This have blown up this morning.  I think they're leaving (fingers crossed). I am not paying for the boots.", "1. Nowhere in the post is anything like \"It's fine, he's a puppy\" mentioned. On the contrary, OP has taken more than the necessary steps to be responsible here.\n2. 9 months is **exactly** when the adolescent chewing phase kicks in for most breeds and is the first time many dogs even need to **start** training.\n3. Whether or not a puppy \"should\" be beyond something is like saying your five-year-old SHOULD be able to tie their shoes. Not everyone hits every milestone on time, and that's not necessarily anyone's fault.\n\nDon't leave things around that you've been warned about, especially in someone else's house.", ">He said he knew how to shear....it did not end well for him.\n\nOh, do please spill the tea!\n\n\n>I've never heard that term before,  but it fits him to a tee.\n\nIt's a saying we heard often in \"West Texas\".  \n(We lived nearly dead center in the state, but anything west of & including, Dallas is \"West Texas\", apparently.)\n\nI'm not Texan.
