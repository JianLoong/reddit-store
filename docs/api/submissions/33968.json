The part about the boots is important. Kevin decided your warnings about the puppy weren't important (fucked around), and the puppy backed up your warnings and claims 100% and ate the damn boots (found out). \n\nNAH, they obviously want help re-purchasing boots, and asking is fine. You did all the stuff you should do. Your husband appears to be trying to smooth the waters, which is also fine. A final \"Nope, I warned you, this is on you.\" is sufficient.

No. Keeping things away from a puppy is standard protocol and they should have known better.", "NTA.

I refused at first, but finally agreesmd because accommodation is insanely expensive in the summer holidays. Before I agreed, I gave them the full run-down on the puppy's behaviour. I told them they can't leave anything on the floor, and the door to their bedroom has to be shut whenever they're not there. To make things easier, I cleared out the top shelf of the cupboard for them and bought several boxes with lids that click into place. When they arrived, I reminded them again. \n\nNTA\n\nThey insisted on staying with you because they were too \"cheap\" to pay for accommodation,  but had $650 boots.

Your husband is \"sulking\" w Kevin?  WTF?\n\n\nJust need to say this.... \n\n\n>We (M & F, 50's) have a nine month old puppy. I've struggled to train him, and hired a professional trainer to help us out. Even so, he does puppy things like chewing anything he can find that looks interesting. He has lots of specific dog toys, but they're clearly not as well designed at all the human-owned things that are so much more desirable to his puppy brain.\n\n\nUm, he's a puppy/juvenile.  This is typical behavior. You didn't state the breed, but there are chewers & then heavy chewers.  \n\nA \"professional trainer\" won't stop his behavior, but a good one will teach YOU why he's appropriately behaving like this & help to minimize by redirection & LOTS of energy draining activities.  \n\nHe prefers people stuff because of the scents. Sit with those toys up against you.  (Might work too encased with a freshly worn shirt or blanket). They'll absorb scent which will provide a sense of comfort.  \n\n You can also \"hide\" chew toys  where he can make a discovery. Make a big deal of the *joy* when he shows you. \n\n\nIf pup discovers something unique (like the goggles), humans turn it into a \"game\"to get it away\n - bonus win for puppy becoming the center of attention.  \n\nI highly recommend teaching pup to *make trade* and you can use that exact phrase. \n\n\nHave some small treats at the ready in a pocket or in a small jar.  Lay some enticing non-acceptable, but safe items around the room.  When he picks one up, tell him *make trade* - show the treat & switch the item over with it.\n\n You can also use a special favored toy, especially after he learns the exchange. It's also a good \"safety lesson\" for the future. \n\n\n\nI've trained my dogs with this for years.  Lately, my senior 15 year old dachs has decided to revisit her youth to scour the house for mysterious stuff. I can  see her joy at being the center of attention for finding socks & paper & writing utensils.  She gets a single *make trade* per day & she is utterly thrilled.  If she keeps pulling out items from  nowhere, she gets her \"egg\".  It's one of those toy balls that rolls & dispenses tiny treats.  It keeps her busy for an hour. Then she's tired for a nap. \n\n\nGood luck with your pup. Enjoy the \"teenage\" stage that not too many talk about.  It's when all the wonderful obedient puppy education goes out the window & its that awkward mystifying \"what in the world\" emerges, just like in humans. \n\n\nWhen Your Dog Is a Teenager\n https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/17/opinion/dogs-puppies-adolescence.html?smid=nytcore-android-share", "NTA\n\nFk, I hate people.
