I'm 32f and my little sister 25f is getting married in April. I'm her maid of honor and am super excited\n\nThe wedding party is a total of 8 people with 4 on each side. Two of the three bridesmaids, I've known their whole life and watched them grow up with my little sister into incredible and independent women. The third bridesmaid is a whole other story. I've never met or interacted with her before only heard great things from my sister and her other two bridesmaids who've met her. \n\nWhen we met she made a comment about how \"genetically gifted\" our family is. I thought that was a weird way to compliment someone. Then she said I look younger than her despite being almost a decade older. I honestly told her that I've been getting expensive skin care and botox treatments done since I turned 28 and that's what she's looking at and I won't look this young without it. \n\nUsually when I say I got cosmetic procedures done people stop making weird age comments. To my face at least. She didn't and said no amount of botox or plastic surgery could fix her face and that I looked like I modeled and with how fat she was even if she lost weight she'd continue to be ugly.\n\nI said I find her to be beautiful and there's no such thing as a perfect body. This was just our first interaction. I went and told my sister that I think the girl is very pretty because I know my sister would pass this on and it would make her feel nice. \n\nBut every time we met since she made these comments. She once said she could strip naked and not one man would look her way. Her body image issues were...not my priority, honestly. It started getting on my nerves having to reassure her or repeatedly compliment her. The other bridesmaids just parroted my words. \n\nThe next time she said how she shouldn't be a bridesmaid because all of us were tall and skinny and pretty but she was short and fat and ugly and it will ruin the aesthetic. \n\nI snapped and said  \"we weren't picked for our beauty. It doesn't matter if you're ugly. Being ugly is not a bad thing. Just like being fat or short is not a bad thing. You're a good person and that's why my sister wants you here.\"\n\nShe looked at me and joked saying I caller her ugly indirectly but within seconds she left sobbing. I didn't know what to do but sent the other bridesmaids to damage control. \n\nNot even an hour later my sister texted me and said I was so needlessly cruel and I won't ever understand her perspective because I've always had \"pretty privilege\". I was shocked because I thought I worded myself very well and explained that not everyone wants skin deep beauty from a person but am I actually missing something because of pretty privilege? The girl has currently said she doesn't want to speak to me yet. \n\nWhile she never called me an asshole my sister did so AITA?", "created_utc": 1673946824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10e7t0u/aita_for_calling_a_girl_ugly/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You say you said IF you are ugly. That is not saying someone is ugly. That is saying regardless of their insecurities about themselves they are wanted here. \n\nAs a person with a... Less than appealing physique... It's clear the other person was making everything about her issues and her insecurities. It's a shame she feels that way, and being kind is really important. But the explicit meaning of what you said was not to call her ugly.", "NTA. Anyone would be annoyed and exhausted if that was happening to them.", "NTA. This person sounds like they want to be the center of attention for not being as attractive as others. She has self image issues. If I were in your situation, after she said something about her looks the second time, I would politely change the subject of discussion.", "NTA.. She's got self esteem issues and needs help.  It's not your job to constantly reassure her that she's pretty, it does get exhausting.  For her to say she's not ready to  talk to you...good,  I personally wouldn't want her talking to me if all she's focusing on is looks.  Hopefully you can get through the wedding with no other issues and tell your sister to handle her.", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nStuck between this and e s h but going with my gut\n\nPersonally  dont think it should have gotten this far. Someone should have pulled her to the side when it started, explained they understand it must be difficult not feeling confident but that shes the only one with this opinion of herself and its not fair to put that on your sister when shes supposed to be enjoying getting ready to get married, not constantly worrying about her friend.\n\nReassurance that shes wanted there and why but also firmly stating she needs to stop vocalising this at every chance", "Soft YTA by mentioning the ugly thing. If you had merely said \"Were not chosen for our looks, but the people that we are\" it would have landed a lot better", "NTA - Ngl with this title I was ready to call you T A, but no. You tried your best to accommodate her. Not every discussion needs to be about looks.", "NAH, you seem to have tried with the best of intentions, and she was absolutely fishing on a hair trigger primed for this.  This was going to happen whether through you or something somebody else mentioned in passing.  She was (subconsciously of course) energetically making this circumstance.  \n\nNow of course, that means it's awful to be her, and tricky to be you, bit for the same of the wedding and bridesmaid harmony, a 1:1 quiet outreach \"Hey girl, look I see you're hurting and I phrased what I said clumsily, but I'm also human.  And we're more alike than you think - why do you think I get treatments and makeup?  To affect my appearance to feel happier with it.  So let's just forget all this and carry on as a team - bride chose you especially as she feels a strong bond with you, and we're all just getting to know you and enjoy hanging out, let's go and give bride the day of her life as allies\" kind of thing.  Obviously adapt to your circumstance, but just as a template.  Reaching out, recognising the other person is in distress, showing vulnerability, building trust, and building a common mission to be \"on the same side\" and redraw \"battle lines\".  \n\nRight now she's anxious that it's her \"Vs\" old friends, whereas you can redraw the pitch as bridesmaids \"Vs\" the challenges of planning a wedding.", "NAH She's got a lot of self hate  and anxiety of looking terrible next to you guys, I don't really think what you said was bad but nothing you said would have helped her she's got to try and help herself.", "Sister, I know I don't need to tell you that you need to be so incredibly delicate when you're speaking to someone with as many self-esteem issues as this young woman clearly has. She's feeling insecure, and making these comments because she is looking for validation. It can be tiresome listening to it over and over again, but it appears you've unintentionally confirmed her biggest suspicion - that you all think she's short, fat, and ugly. \n\nThat's not to say that her issues need to be your issues. They don't, and it's annoying she's put them onto you. But I think your response could have been more diplomatically phrased. Perhaps leave her to work through her emotions, and when the time is right, mention to her (doesn't need to be in person) that she misunderstood what you were saying. That you do genuinely think she's beautiful, as you've told her many times. What you were saying was '*even if she wasn't*' yada yada yada.", "soft YTA. while you did not intend it to be such, it was kind of insulting and this might be a good but harsh lesson to be more careful with words in the future. You could have made a generalised statement about how looks don't matter, but to specify 'short' 'fat' and 'ugly' is rude.\n\nThis may also be ESH, coz as a bridesmaid she should try to deal with her insecurities in her own time.", "ESH but mostly her. She sounds exhausting. But you probably should've walked away, taken the high road, been the bigger person. All those things that are so very hard to do when someone is pushing your buttons. Send her some flowers and I bet it all blows right over.", "Soft YTA. I\u2019ve read your comment a dozen times and it still sounds like you called her ugly to me. I get that it wasn\u2019t the intention, and your point is reasonable, but your words aren\u2019t clear. \n\nI\u2019d apologize and just say you weren\u2019t calling her ugly and that you didn\u2019t communicate your point clear enough. However, I\u2019d stop engaging her in conversation on this topic. She obviously has body issues. Nothing you say is going to change that, nor is it your job to compliment her and try and make her feel better", "YTA\n\nIt can be difficult to deal with self-deprecating people, so I get that you were frustrated, but in the process of using the terminology of short, fat, and ugly all you did was confirm her fears. It's like a backhanded compliment.\n\nEven though your intention was to indicate that those don't matter as much as what's on the inside, the verbiage of \"even if you are\" is what got you in trouble here. There are many ways you could have said the same thing without \"confirming\" she was those things.\n\nThere have been comedy movies where people exaggerate this exact interaction to something along the lines of \"even if you are short and fat and ugly and disgusting and gross and no one could ever love you, you still have us\" or something similar. It seems a little more obvious when you take it to that extreme, but the sentiment is the same.\n\nYou were tired of being nice and placating her, so you lashed out. Your comment was intended to put a stop to her comments. Well, it worked...", "Edit my judgement on reflection: ESH, her more than you.\n\nThis girl is exhausting and centring herself during your sister\u2019s wedding prep. She obviously knows you have your own insecurities because you\u2019ve had cosmetic procedures, and she\u2019s continuing to pick at them. Even if she\u2019s using positive framing this is frequently a manipulation tactic; \u201cOP is so much prettier than me\u201d to make everyone go \u201cno she isn\u2019t!\u201d; effectively validating herself while putting you down. \n\nThat said, these are not the actions of a healthy well-adjusted person. While I appreciate that everyone has their limits, snapping at her in public was always going to end poorly, and could be even more detrimental to your sister\u2019s wedding. I would apologise and make it clear you weren\u2019t calling her ugly but relying on a hypothetical to show that beauty is only skin-deep.", "**YTA**  \n\n>I was shocked because I thought I worded myself very well\n\nI don't think you did that all.   It was clear from the beginning that the woman had a complex about \"beauty\" and your wording actually confirmed her insecurity.      It's one thing to say that  your sister's wedding is not a beauty contest, it's another to talk about ugly people being in the bridal party -- even in the abstract.   You and this other bridesmaid seem to be two sides of the same coin -- too much preoccupation with \"beauty\".", "I can totally empathize with both of you here. I get that you were trying to reassure her that outer beauty isn't what matters, but from someone who has low self-esteem and low self-confidence, that seems to have really hurt her. It's not always what you say, but how you say it. I have to give a you a soft YTA since this was unintentional.", "ESH, people hosting pity parties constantly are very tiresome and annoying and she needs to get help rather than force everyone to shower her in praise or tread on eggshells but you were clearly a bit mean in basically outright calling her ugly.", "NTA but leaning to esh. You shouldn't really snap at a person like that. She's clearly got a lot of issues going on and you went about it in a really bad way. She's not great for how she's acting around strangers and needs help, not your responsibility but neither is having a go at the poor girl.", "YTA. You have to put up with this girl for a short time and you can\u2019t handle simply not calling her ugly to her face? I\u2019m sorry she made you feel \u201cbad\u201d by saying that you\u2019re pretty and have great skin? You were being very sensitive about something she meant kindly\u2014and that you paid top dollar to achieve\u2014and then you effectively reaffirmed for her that she\u2019s ugly. Huge YTA.", "YTA but not in any kind of huge way, it really is more of the blindness. But yes, your phrasing was terrible and for someone with insecurities that serious it was inevitable that she would hear it as 'you're exactly as ugly as you think you are' and miss the rest of the message.\n\nPeople like that generally make those comments needing someone to contradict or reassure them. This, as you've noticed, is exhausting, but since you're in a wedding party together you sort of have to do it for the duration, it's not like you two are going to be lifelong friends. She needs to go to therapy or maybe her actual close friends need to stop blindly reassuring her and get her to change her attitude, but there's not much you can do about that.\n\nSo yes, I don't know if you want to call it 'pretty privilege' but you're definitely not seeing what someone in your phrasing would hear. If the sentence contains the words 'you're ugly' those were always the only words she was going to hear regardless of the actual content of the sentence. If you express a sentence like that you need to couch it in multiple reassurances that she *isn't* actually ugly but it wouldn't matter if she *were*.\n\nAnnoying and frustrating, I know, but it's a wedding party. You should apologise and then try to be reassuring again, though probably she'll never believe a positive thing you say about her again since she'll have heard this as an admission you thought she was ugly all along and were lying to her. Insecurities, man, they mess with people's heads...", "Go Jim, Jim solves everything.", " YTA with a little bit of ESH. She\u2019s clearly very insecure and fishing for compliments and that could be annoying eventually and darkens the atmosphere of every interaction. But honestly saying what you said to someone who is that insecure is honestly one of the worst thing you could say, it does sound like you called her ugly and that\u2019s exactly what she was afraid of, someone confirming her negative thoughts.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
