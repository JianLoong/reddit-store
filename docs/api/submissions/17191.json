That's some serious codependence/neediness/control issues.", "NTA, the reaction seems disproportionate unless you had already had a pattern of missing family gatherings before this. At the end of the day, Easter comes every year.", "NTA. you\u2019re grieving and no matter what people say, holidays *are* optional.", "NTA. I think your wife's real problem is a man having feelings.", "NTA - you\u2019re grieving, MIL should mind her business it\u2019s one missed event, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not family orientated. Your wife shouldn\u2019t be bringing it up on a regular basis, have that chat with her as to why you didn\u2019t go, it\u2019s in the past and move forward.", "I don't know. My cat who I had for 18 years also died the day before we celebrated Easter. We were hosting this year so I had no choice. Everyone came over whether I was ready or not. Having people around kind of helped me.\n\nDoes that make you an AH for staying home to grieve? I don't think so. Especially because it sounds like your wife only cares because she's getting flack about it. NTA", "Absolutely not the A. Bear was a much loved member of your family.  You were in shock and grieving. Of course it would not be possible to attend any large gatherings. You take all the time you need. With you in full support and spirit.", "Nta\n\nYou are family oriented as you mourned the loss of one of your family members. If anything Your family just doesn't understand how you felt and should probably apologise to you.", "NTA at all - whether it was for your dog or in general, a mental health break. If I were your MIL, I\u2019d send home a care food takeaway bag. Where the f is humanity nowadays? Why is there such a stressful level of expectations in a relationship?", "Without knowing how big of a deal Easter is in your family it's hard to say.  I mean, for my family missing Easter would not cause an eyelash to bat but I know some families for whom it is \"AN EVENT\" and it would be akin to missing your mother's funeral.  \n\nWithout knowing specifics as to the importance of this occasion to the family dynamic, I don't think anyone can rightly judge. \n\nI'd say NTA but then, I don't give two shits about Easter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is absolutely a big deal and embarassing tbh.", "Oh please. A meal with in laws is not a court order. OP doesn\u2019t have to attend.", "Not in the least.  I honestly don't see what the big deal is.  People have lives, etc.", "Again, I said extenuating circumstances aside, it's embarassing for a significant other to not attend if they have no reason.", "The significant other who decides not to attend if they have no reason isn\u2019t embarrassed. It is the insecure partner who can\u2019t attend their own family\u2019s meal by themselves, gossiping in laws and other busy bodies that are embarrassed.", "\"Not feeling it\" is enough of a reason.  No offense but the level of control and/or living in each other's pockets  that you're implying is stifling.  Seriously, if you miss a meal or whatever, what are they going to do, kick you out of the family?  Not bloody likely.", "Embarrassing? What's embarrassing is being such a weak AH that instead of defending your partner (\"mom, Partner needed time to grieve and I 100% support that. Please do not bring it up again\") you shame them.", "You do realize that other families exist on this planet and they have ways of doing things that differ from your idea of how things should be done, right?", "This is a cultural/familial subjective opinion. It's not based in any logical foundation.", "Exactly.  And if someone were crass enough to make comments about it, a veiled reference to their insecurities would be more than enough to shut it down fast.  I really don't get people like the ones attabe's talking about."]}
