They sent over a lookbook with suggestions along with their invitations - some of them included leather and lace, latex, anything with feathers, sequins, etc., but guests could go as wild or as toned down as they wanted. Some photos were shared and they were very beautiful. It certainly wasn't traditional, but I liked that. I've never been very fond of some of the rules that come along with weddings, and this felt like a wonderfully fun way to break them.\n\nWhen I brought this up to my fianc\u00e9e, I knew it was a long shot. I wasn't expecting her to actually incorporate it, but I thought it was worth a shot. Plus, it's just an interesting concept and an enjoyable video to watch no matter what. It was never my intention to offend her.\n\nAfter watching it, I could tell she was upset with me. I asked what was wrong and she said she couldn't believe I was genuinely suggesting a theme like that where guests were encouraged to upstage her, and that it was very disrespectful. I told her it was just an idea - one I never thought she would actually use - and that she was free to keep the planning process going as it had been.

Here's a theme we should use! It's called \"your dreams and your chance to feel special mean two things.

Most brides want to feel beautiful and special on their wedding day. They're not looking for people to upstage them. That's generally frowned upon. I get that you liked that people could be free to be dramatic, charismatic, and fabulous but those words were a disaster. Also, unless she's into that kind of dressing up, her wedding day is probably not the day to introduce it. You're not an asshole. You just had a fun idea.

You clearly meant it as a goof, and I don't appreciate all of the misandrist/misogynistic comments about how a gay wedding \"doesn't have a bride\" to upstage.

If she's a more traditional person, she's probably under a TON of stress with all the planning.

Every guest was dressed beautifully and put so much effort into looking their best. Surprisingly, nobody looked like a bride or wore white!! I thought the theme was fun and it would fit a bride that would be into it. However, I don\u2019t know your fianc\u00e9e.

I assume it was a joke to phrase it that way in the TikTok because there was no bride. I can see how she might feel it\u2019s disrespectful to her if it\u2019s phrased that way.

I can see how unique that idea is, but a bride wants to be the center of attention on her wedding day. But the point is you asked and when she said no, you didn\u2019t insist. That\u2019s part of the whole communication and partnership here.", "NTA. People put way too many emotions into their wedding day (not getting married, the literal wedding day/event) and start to get a bit of a complex about it. Your fiancee could have just told you \"no way are we doing that\" and then moved on. There is no reason to be truly upset with the suggestion... Seems pretty harmless", "NTA. I'm a woman and it sounded like a lot of fun to me but approach her with more sensitivity in the future. I never dreamed of a big frou frou wedding but it seems that she did.", "NAH I get you thought it was a cool theme, but generally speaking most brides don\u2019t wanna be outshone at their own wedding.

Like a flavor at an ice cream parlor. Except, this ice cream parlor is the most important ice cream parlor and the flavor is one in a lifetime.\n\nHer reaction was a bit over the top and I don't quite get why she's still mad at you as it was only a suggestion you didn't press, but... some people really don't want to share their ice cream.", "NTA. She misinterpreted your intentions. She might be a little stressed about the wedding, though.", "NTA. I would have loved that for my wedding \ud83d\ude04", "NTA. It's a nice thought, but perhaps more fitted for the afterparty? I would imagine that older members of your respective families might feel a tad out of place in such surroundings :)", "NTA. You were just suggesting an idea. Simple as that.", "NTA. There\u2019s two of you in the wedding and she was letting you run stuff by her. It looked interesting to you so you ran it by her. She didn\u2019t have to get her undies in a bunch, she could have just said she wants to be the star that day. Every bride is different and every wedding is different. I honestly don\u2019t know why brides put so much pressure on themselves and everyone else to make it a perfect day and all about them. It\u2019s a lot more fun and less stressful if you just look to make a *happy* wedding - whatever that means to you guys.", "I will be in the minority here but I say you're NTA.

All you wanted to do was suggest a theme. People are even saying it was foolish of you to ask when the video didn't include a bride. But I am sure there are plenty of brides to be out there that think this is a funny and unique Idea, or wouldn't get upset over you merely suggesting the idea. I think she took it too personally.", "NTA. But I think as the wedding gets nearer she might turn into a bridezilla even she can\u2019t even see the humor in that video.", "NTA for showing it to her. It's a different style for sure. If you forced it on her yeah an issue but just showing it to her? She's being a bit sensitive over that.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 need to unbunch her panties and/or remove the stick. Obviously don\u2019t tell her that.", "That sounds awesome! I really do not get this \u201cdon\u2019t upstage the bride\u201d crap that\u2019s become so common. Maybe it\u2019s just Reddit\u2026 I hope so.

He knew it was a longshot. He pitched the idea because he liked it. When she got upset, he asked what was wrong and she explained.

It's ridiculous... no one can 'upstage' a bride because it's not a contest.  It's all built on insecurities and image.", "Thank you!", "I just read the post again, and there was NO bride at the inspiration wedding, it was two GROOMS.

Most wedding guests dress up very nicely, make themselves up much nicer than they normally would, and look great, just make sure to stay a few notches below the bride. The general rule is just not to upstage the bride by wearing white (or whatever color in the couple's culture is reserved for the bride) or by wearing a super fancy ballgown, glitzed out/bejeweled dresses that cost thousands, etc. When the theme is literally upstage the bride, it seems to be encouraging some of those glitzy outfits that typically would be uncouth.\n\nThere is a huge difference between looking like shit compared to someone and staying a few notches below them on the spectrum, which is what most ppl do.", "[deleted]", "Correct. The problem wasn't the theme itself, the problem was the specific words \"upstage the bride\" being directed specifically at your bride. You can dismiss that as semantics if you want, but words do mean things.", "Eh...idk about that. As you said in your post and as you've described her, your fiancee is pretty traditional when it comes to the idea of this being \"her\"(/plural \"your\") day and you've been cool with that. I can see why she was blindsided when, after leaving her free to plan \"her\" special day, where all the eyes are on her and she (and you) are the center of attention, you then suggest the very opposite of that: eyes on everyone and in fact everyone should be doing their best to attract attention to themselves and not the bride!\n\nYou're right in your previous post: this works for the two grooms because, traditionally, grooms still aren't the center of attention. In a gay wedding, they are and the very fact that there are two of them makes it almost impossible for them not to be. The very fact that it is a gay wedding is a testimony to their love and how much they're willing to put up with to demonstrate it in that way, no matter how everyone else is dressed. That's a far more difficult sell in a standard hetero relationship.\n\nIt's still a great idea for a party, but in your case, it's probably more suited for, for example, a New Years party you and your wife are throwing than for your wedding. Actually, you might have even been able to sell it for a big engagement party, but, yeah, not the wedding.", "On top of the semantics though, you've said you've been very hands- off and she's been doing all the planning... How well would you respond if you'd been working on, say, building a dining table by yourself for weeks - deigned it yourself, bought the wood... then your partner comes in with a TikTok video of a completely different style of table that's way fancier than yours and says \"Hey we should do it this way\". Would you not feel a bit miffed?\n\nIt's never great to jump in the middle of someone's process with a different idea that disregards all the work done prior.", "I'm a woman and I agree it's ridiculous people are offended by the title when you were just showing her a very cool fun wedding video", "Don\u2019t invite possible drama on a wedding. Let it go", "Oh i didn't realize gathering a large group of all ones closest friends and family was to completely disregard them for the sake of two people. Silly me for thinking they were invited because they were important and not as background noise for the spectacle that is the bride and groom"]}
