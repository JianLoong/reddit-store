I usually don't go on Tuesdays but I'm trying to throw in some more work throughout the week. There wasn't really anybody I know for real when I was up there so when I needed a spot I just called out to no one in particular asking for a spot.\n\nThe first person to say something is this girl who I knew would be no help. Not a beat after she finishes saying that she can spot me I say \"I'm not tryna die today.\" She had this offended look on her face and I was like \"Can you deadlift 315?\" She ain't say nothing and I said \"That's what I thought.\" I get somebody else to spot me and go on and finish my workout.\n\nWhen I'm walking about trying to get to my car to go home; she comes up to me and starts jawing about how I was sexist and all that. That I was disrespectful just because she was a girl and I should apologize for being misogynistic. That's not true at all, I just knew she wouldn't be able to do anything if I were to fail the rep. When I'm doing a hard workout I do tend to be short with people so maybe I could've been a little more polite but I don't think I did anything wrong.

Regardless of if she was male or female, you spoke like an asshole to someone offering assistance.", "YTA, she doesn\u2019t need to lift the total weight, and no one here believes you were benching 300+, she just needs to be able to lift 20-40 which I\u2019m sure she\u2019s capable of. You just made yourself look like a fool.", "YTA.  Here's the thing about spotting- they don't need to lift all the weight. They have to help you lift it back on to the rack.  If they have to list all the weight, your doing too many reps or too much weight .  Double ah for being rude.\nEdit - typo", "From a female who CAN deadlift over 315#, YTA. \n\nAs others have mentioned deadlifting the weight being benched isn't a prerequisite for being an effective spotter. \n\nDo you ask everyone if they can deadlift #315 before you let them spot you? Or just women?", "YTA \n\nI don\u2019t get what deadlifting 315 has to do with spotting someone\u2019s bench. Were you benching 315? I doubt it. \n\nAnyway, a bench spotter is meant to assist you on the rebound if you fail your rep, not take the bar away from you entirely. I\u2019ve been spotted by people weaker than me, and vice versa, many times.", "YTA, I bench press significantly more than you and I've let girls spot me before. On a normal set if you know your limits the spotter should never have to apply more than 10-20lb of force to the bar. Even if you were going for a max attempt where you might experience total failure there are nicer ways to say it", "If you're benching, you don't need someone who can deadlift 315, you need someone who can upright row 315. Oh, no one can do that? Hmm I guess your logic fails then.", "YTA. \n\nYou do not need to dead lift 315 to spot someone. \n\nA simple \u201cno thank you\u201d would have sufficed but you had to be rude.

I spot my partner benching 200+ pounds and I definitely can\u2019t deadlift that much weight.

You could have rejected her nicely instead of insulting her. She was trying to help.\n\nAlso from one gym junkie to another, a spotter doesn\u2019t have to be NEARLY as strong as you. The spotters job isn\u2019t to completely lift the weight off of you, it is to relieve some weight for you so that you are able to rack it. As someone who can\u2019t lift much, I can still spot because I take off enough weight in order for the person to finish the rep and rack the weight. Do your research and stop being sexist.", "YTA. That was totally not needed at all. She was literally offering to help you out, and that\u2019s how you reply? Yikes, you need to work on you\u2019re manners. It would\u2019ve been far easier for the both of you had you just asked her whether or not she could deadlift 315 from the beginning. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re also trying to defend this behavior of yours is also not okay at all. You shouldn\u2019t been talking to someone in that manner, especially if that someone is OFFERING TO HELP YOU OUT.", "Starts jawing about how i was sexist and all that. Superb attitude right there (sarcasm)\n \nI spot my husband all the time. You dont need to be able to deadlift 315 to spot someone on bench. The whole point of spotting is being able to take some of the load to be able to rack safely. You could have easily said actually im lifting pretty heavy today and id prefer one of the guys to spot, thank you for your offer if you felt THAT strongly about having a guy spot you or you know just gone over to a guy and just asked instead of just asking in general. \n\nYou were rude and ignorant and came across as completetly sneery and sexist. \n\n\nYTA", "Good lord, if you need a spotter who can deadlift the whole weight, you're doing it wrong.\n\nBut the way you interacted with her was totally uncalled for, condescending and, yes, can easily be interpreted as having undertones of misogyny. \n\nYTA. Work on how to talk with people properly.", "YTA. For how you declined, not the fact of declining. \n\nYou might also be the asshole for assuming she couldn\u2019t spot you, depending on how heavy you were going and how big she was, but that\u2019s not necessarily asshole-ish.", "YTA - you were rude. Simple as that.\n\nYou called out to a room full of strangers to ask for help and when the first person who stepped up didn't meet your macho vision you acted like an ass. \n\n\"I'm planning to deadlift 315 here, do you feel comfortable spotting me for that\" would have been sufficient.", "YTA, your comment was just plain rude. Unless you were planning on asking every person, woman or man, if they could deadlift 315? \n\nAlso, do you have any idea how a bench spot works??? I used to spot people on bench who benched waayyy more than me. Unless you\u2019re completely ego lifting, the spotter really only needs to lift a little bit of the weight, with their assistance you should be able to get the rest of the weight up. \n\nEven if you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with her spotting you, there was a MUCH more respectful way to decline. Especially considering you just called out for a spot, and didn\u2019t ask anyone specifically.", "The only way she would need to deadlift that much is if you were pushing over 500-600 pounds into failure reps.\n\nYTA for being a sexist, a choosing beggar, and also feeling like you should brag about your mediocre max lifts.", "YTA.\n\n1) She doesn't need to be able to dead lift 315lbs, just enough to get it OFF of you.\n2) You asked if anyone could spot and she chimed in then you insulted her with a blatantly sexist comment.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve said \u201cno thank you\u201d but instead you chose to be a jerk for no reason.", "YTA but not for saying no to her offer, it\u2019s the fact that you were rude to her in your response. She was trying to help you and you were a dick.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou were rude and seem to misunderstand what someone is doing when they spot you... I'd recommend a Fitness 101 course so you can brush up on the basics.\n\nYou also sound like an entitled asshole for how you act.", "YTA.\n\nIs there some sort of bad blood between you and this girl? You seem incredibly rude and angry for this girl who was just trying to help you. What's your problem?", "You\u2019re don\u2019t understand how spotters work. If you need someone to deadlift 100% of the Weight off of you, you\u2019re lifting way the Fuck too heavy.

You asked for help, she volunteered, if you didn't think she could do it properly there are millions of ways to say that nicely.\n\nAlso if you need a spotter who can deadlift that much then just lift a lighter load, ffs YTA", "were you planning on going to failure? Spots normally don't have to take on the entire weight even when struggling.", "YTA.\n\nAlso you're a bad and inexperienced lifter if you think a spotter has to lift an entire bar off you in order to be a good spotter.  They're there to help you get out from under the bar, not to completely lift it off you.  To completely lift a bar off you, they'd have to be straddling your head/shoulders.\n\nPlease get a trainer and relearn your bad lifting habits, but as for the poor speech choices, I can't help you.", "YTA\n\nIf you didn't want this person to spot you for whatever reason all you had to say was no thank you.  But nope--you had to toss a big old heap of shit on top of it.\n\nAnd--you have no clue if she could have spotted you.  None. You know what you 'believe' that you know which is that she is girl so clearly couldn't spot the big burly dude like you.

I\u2019ve had numerous women spot me. If you need more than a gentle push, you should lower the weight.

Idk about lifting but you don\u2019t have to be rude in your response. You should apologize for that at least", "I mean. My guess is that you were being a misogynistic ass.

I'm glad that she said something to you too because how can you be so blind and ignorant. Not only that but you're so damn rude. Do you respond to everyone in that way when they politely offer their help?\n\nAlso in general don't assume someone can't spot, I'm weak asf but I'm sure that I can spot someone if I was asked. I'm spotting, not lifting the full weight. And if I didn't think I could, then I wouldn't offer my help. Simple. Also x2 you needa educate yourself on what sexism is cuz I bet your the type of person to be like \"but I didn't say woman can't spot\" or something but your actions and words will show it and you've showed it here. You are sexist. Period. YTA", "Gotta stop them roids and contain the rage\n\nYTA", "YTA because of how rude you were. she just wanted to help. you could\u2019ve explained nicely", "YTA. You insulted and were extremely rude a woman who simply offered you help. You could have politely declined and thanked her. If you wanted a little snark, you even could have made a joke that \u201cif you fail you don\u2019t want there to be 2 hospital trips!\u201d\n\nInstead you come up with the most socially inept way to resolve the situation. And then you come to the internet for validation???? 0 social skills. This is the shit that school shooters are made of.", "lol dude just from the tone of your post I can absolutely tell YTA", "YTA. In what world does a spotter need to lift the entire weight? \n\nShe was \"jawing\" at you?\n\nNo cap, bruh. You finna be lonely forever. Or whatever the hell kids say these days.", "YTA man. \n\nIt's ok to say you'd prefer someone stronger than her to help you. \n\nBut you didn't even try to be a normal person with a polite and simple, \"no thank you.\" You didn't even stop at  with just a flat, \"no.\"\n\nYou decided to dial your assholery up to 11 and be actively rude to someone just offering to help out to keep you safe.", "YTA\n\nFirst, your response was rude.\n\nSecond, if you can't do that last rep you don't need your spotter to lift the entire weight.  Just taking 20lbs of it is usually enough to allow you to push it the rest of the way up to the rack.\n\nUnless you are one of those guys that has no idea how much he can bench.", "Yeah yta she offered help , instead of declining politely you were rude", "I can\u2019t deadlift 315lbs/142.8 kg but I sure as shit can spot it. Also if your bench has safeties use them too. \nYTA", "YTA- 1. You were rude. 2. When was the last time your spotter had to lift the entire weight off of you. Are you benching 1000 pounds? Generally, if a spotter can lift 1/4-1/3 of the weight, you are good to go. Even a guy that could deadlift the whole 315 couldn\u2019t do it while he was bent over and the full weight was sitting on your chest. If you bench that much and need that much help, you are reckless.", "YTA. Could you be a tiny bit respectful and not a massive jerk? You can\u2019t? Thought so.", "YTA\n\n1. You talk like an AH\n2.  You aren't even correct. To spot someone bench pressing you don't need to be able to deadlift that weight because A. It's not the same workout or full motion B.  She wouldn't be doing it alone\n\nSo yea you're a double AH", "YTA and are you 15 or something because spotting is something a child can do\n\nor have you been making your poor spotters lift every ounce off your body this entire time?", "YTA. That\u2019s not how you talk to people who offer to help you. Obviously you could\u2019ve responded in a kind manner.", "YTA. only an idiot risks injury by pushing so far that 10 pounds of assist isn\u2019t enough of a spot.", "Anyone can do no thank you in a respectful way.

If you tried, I'd bet you could think of three or four ways to politely decline her generous offer of assistance.", "YTA. You asked for help then acted weird. She overreacted but you come across pretty bad here.\n\nThe other weird thing is she doesn\u2019t need to deadlift 315. Just the difference between what you can lift and 315. Unless you totally fail and tear something but no dude is going to help you either.", "YTA, how hard was it to say \u201chey thank you I appreciate it but, I would feel more comfortable with someone who can spot in the 300 pound range\u201d doing a hard workout is not an excuse to be rude to someone who offered to help you. Do better", "1) \n\nYou never explained why you knew she \"would be no help.\" If you knew for a fact that it was more weight than she could handle, you should have disclosed that. It sounds like you just dismissed her because she's a girl. YTA.\n\n2) \n\n>she comes up to me and starts jawing about how I was sexist and all that\n\nYTA.

Sexiest and entitled.", "This one is easy today, YTA like big time. There was a way more polite way to approach that situation. She went out of her way to volunteer to help and you were an AH. Also to clarify your language, you weren't short with her you were a total AH to her.", "You got like negative rizz lmao", "YTA why do you need to be so rude? what was wrong with saying no thanks?", "YTA.\n\nYour delivery was incredibly rude and entitled. Not to mention *very* sexist and misogynistic. Would you have rather gotten a dude who was weaker to spot you?\n\n*You don\u2019t need to lift the same in order to spot.* A spotter is there for support so you have less weight to lift when you\u2019re done with a set.", "YTA", "Absolutely YTA.

She was trying to help you, the least you could have done was be polite.", "Definitely YTA.\n\nThere was zero need to throw that in. YOU literally asked to the dead air for a spot and have the audacity to be ignorant to the first person who offers? You said it out loud because you didn\u2019t know anyone there. If you were going to be picky on who was going to spot you, you should\u2019ve scouted someone out. It\u2019s the stereotypes for me. It\u2019s the fact that you have to question if she can deadlift 315 or not for me. How do you know what she\u2019s capable of? Did you ask whoever helped you if they could deadlift 315 or did you just assume they could because it was most likely a man? I\u2019ve seen females put men to shame and you can\u2019t just look at someone and know if they can deadlift 315 or not.

YTA.", "YTA. it was not necessary at ALL to say that to her. if you were REALLY unsure about it, you should\u2019ve simply just asked if she would be able to lift the weight you were lifting. she probably didn\u2019t respond because she was in shock of how much of an AH you were being", "I\u2019ve never asked a spotter how much they can deadlift because it doesn\u2019t take much to help someone put that last rep back up on the hooks.

So a spotter doesn't need to be able to deadlift the bar, a spotter just needs to assist you in shifting the bar to drop the plates. So from my view, you were fundamentally wrong and a dick about it (The James Bond) ergo AH,", "YTA.

I usually don't go on Tuesdays but I'm trying to throw in some more work throughout the week. There wasn't really anybody I know for real when I was up there so when I needed a spot I just called out to no one in particular asking for a spot.\n\nThe first person to say something is this girl who I knew would be no help. Not a beat after she finishes saying that she can spot me I say \"I'm not tryna die today.\" She had this offended look on her face and I was like \"Can you deadlift 315?\" She ain't say nothing and I said \"That's what I thought.\" I get somebody else to spot me and go on and finish my workout.\n\nWhen I'm walking about trying to get to my car to go home; she comes up to me and starts jawing about how I was sexist and all that. That I was disrespectful just because she was a girl and I should apologize for being misogynistic. That's not true at all, I just knew she wouldn't be able to do anything if I were to fail the rep. When I'm doing a hard workout I do tend to be short with people so maybe I could've been a little more polite but I don't think I did anything wrong. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "So, I presume you were benching (because deadlifts and squats don't need spotters), which means you need someone who can get the plates off the bar, not someone who can lift a fully loaded bar off you.

Nothing about the situation called for you to be \"short with her\".", "YTA,\n\nRegular gym user here, anyone with gym knowledge know the spotter does not carry the whole weight during a press, merely assist when struggling unless an emergency where the lifter gives up. Baring in mind OP is training alone I'm assuming they're not attempting any new PB records sinply going through the motions of a workout and would like the reassurance of a spotter. \n\nThe post seems to be more a brag on what OP is lifting while giving a shitty ego driven attitude to a stranger offering help.

That's not spotting, that's someone else doing your rep and helping to inflate you ego by you thinking you did (X) reps you did with (X) plates.\n\nThat was misogynistic. If you didn't think she could properly\\* spot you, then say \"No thank you\" and ask someone else. Don't insult her.\n\n\\*Proper spotting to me means knowing when to help and by how much.
