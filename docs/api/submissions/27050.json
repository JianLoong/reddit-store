This is weird ok? YTA for going back on an arrangement you agreed to but she\u2019s TA for valuing points she essentially gets for free to actual cash value. Even if she is giving up something that has value, you\u2019re married and a family unit, and she is being petty.", "Seems simple based on this weird 50/50 plan y\u2019all have ... only use her points to book her flight. \n\nESH \u2014 both of you are petty.", "YTA. If you agree to split expenses for flights, it doesn't matter that she's paying hers in another currency (airline miles of credit card points). It's still an asset she's spending on you that she can no longer spend on herself. You owe her. Half the equivalent cash price, or maybe half the cash price of the flight you would have taken instead, seems fair. (Sometimes points are much cheaper than cash prices, so you take a more expensive flight, etc. You can figure out a formula.).  \nDick move of you to get cash back for yourself from your credit card but feel entitled to get her credit card earnings for free.", "ESH\nYou can still put a price (but maybe not the full amount of the plane ticket?) on the credit card points, since she only got them bc she was spending money before. And she could have used the points for something else. If you want to split everything 50:50, you\u2018d have to pay back the value of the points used. \nThis 50:50 business sounds petty to me in general, but to each their own. I\u2018d just start a savings account for vacations together as a family.", "ESH i think you guys are being too calculative, but every relationship is different \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f My family is free to use my points from my credit card anytime", "INFO: Is she the mother of your son?\n\nThis has more relevance than appears at first.", "YTA.

You had a deal to split the costs. If you want to buy her miles to reimburse her, that's doable, too. It's just usually a worse deal than paying her back for half the flight price. Either way, if you agreed to split costs, split costs regardless of what currency they're paid in.", "Then just pay her what your flight would have cost .", "Then I think ESH... just a little bit.\n\nYou shouldn't be keeping your cashback rewards all to yourself, but she shouldn't be expecting you to pay full retail price of the airline tickets, either.

The airline accepts them in lieu of cash; you can determine the value easily enough by looking at the price you would have paid normally.", "But that's the thing, what is the \"cost\" to split? I can't even wrap my head around it. Is it the ticket price? Is it the # of dollars spent to earn said points? Just seems very confusing to me. \n\nAnd then if it's \"got it for free but here, you owe me 500usd\" feels weird to me. :P\n\nMaybe I'm just TA here. Thx for the input though all so far!", " I guess it depends on whether you are a family unit or two individuals living as a family. As a family unit who share costs in my head that means cash outlay. So her points are a family bonus, there is no cash cost to her in using them, so the cash cost to be shared is the amount after the points discount. Saying that, if you guys meticulously split household expenses then her share of the trip can be paid how she likes including using points.", "What do you do with your cash back from your program?"]}
