Waking up on time because you know you'll miss the bus and be absent from school is accountability that a fifteen year old should be able to recognize imo.\n\nBut yeah, you definitely should have informed your Mom and brother so they wouldn't panic.", "NTA. My Bonus Son was the worst with this problem. I tried everything I could think to do but nothing worked. The situation miraculously resolved itself when his boss told him if he was late again, he was fired. He was so indignant telling the story-he even said \"Boss knows I have a truck payment \" lol. He then asked if partner and I 'had his back' ie would make his payments. We said, \"Absolutely not\"! That was 7 years ago and, to my knowledge,  he's never been late since. When actual consequences were on the line, he got himself moving without any help!", "NTA\n\nI've lived with several people who have never learned how to get up on their own because there is always someone who enables their poor behavior. \n\nI don't know if this stems from childhood or not. By the time I was 11 I had a paper route and I was getting up on my own for school and work. I am to the point my body often wakes up on it's own around the time I need with or without a clock.\n\nI entertained some of these people, but it gets old. It's frustrating and annoying having someone rely on you getting them up and then acting like assholes when you don't.\n\nYou get them an \"Atomic Alarm Clock\", they sell them on Amazon, they have a decibel level of 80+ and come with a mattress vibrator to shake the bed as well.", "NTA. She is 15. She needs to do it without the help of other people", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe a little harsh, she could have learned the lesson not on a school day when your mom is at work, but then again she could have learned when she is 25 and gets fired for being late at work.", "If you didn't warn her the night before that AJ would be gone, and you wouldn't wake her up, YTA. \n\nIt's fine you don't approve of the system her and AJ have, it's pretty devious to just leave her hanging like that.

Is she sleeping through the alarm or just being lazy?", "YTA - not because it wasn't a good lesson for your sister but because of the impacts on AJ and your Mum. AJ who you admit has a lot on his plate had one night off at a party and had a chance to be a teenager. But he still felt the responsibility so he asked you to do it. Ok it looks like you didn't agree totally and he should have assumed you were going to be a AH to him about it. Your mother got a call from the school that her daughter was lost and missing and it affected her so badly she was off trying to recover the rest of the day.\n\nWhat AJ has learned is that he can't ever expect you to step up to help him or your Mum out. And that you don't consider the full consequences of your actions. Don't be surprised or upset if he continues to treat you and your single sister the same because you both are children. And poor guy, he can't even have one night off without having the responsibility of looking after his siblings.", "Unpopular opinion, but NTA. Tell both AJ and Kaylie that if he wants to wake her up all her life, that is on him, but you will not do that.\n\nKaylie is 15 and of she has trouble getting up (I have too) she should start to think of solutions.\n\nI also do not think you are TA for not send a message to your mom.

You didn't tell everyone you were planning to make your sister learn the hard way. You showed your brother that you are unreliable (he expected you to help him with this wake up) and you can't be counted on, you let others down intentionally, unlike your sister.\n\nThey are right, it won't kill you to do it. It's quite strange that you are so eager to throw your sister under the bus just because she isn't like you. It sounds like you have much bigger problems than your sister.", "Nope NTA.

You absolutely suck for not telling everyone that you wouldn\u2019t do it. Your poor freaking mom. For scaring her like that, you should definitely be ashamed of yourself.

Everyones a little bit to blame, but the overall situation seems to be kinda mild so I don't wanna say ESH either.\n\nYou, your brother, and mom are so busy pointing the finger at one another that the actual person who is to blame is getting completely overlooked, your sister. Your mom and brother are at fault for enabling her and acting like she's an elementary schooler who needs to be managed, who can't control her own actions and choices and habits. Like she's innocent and isn't playing a role in this and therefore shame on you for not helping to shoulder the responsibility of managing her. No. She's 15. This is ridiculous, and it's time to learn, especially because it took her until past 10am and still didn't wake up herself? Come on.\n\nYou're partially at fault because you knew this would happen and didn't warn your mother prior--it costs nothing to be kind and anyone might guess this would happen and it'll scare a mother to get a call like that from the school. Your brother is just wanted to enjoy some time being young, and this got ruined for him too. Not your fault, but it costs nothing to be kind.\n\nI'm also not saying your sister is the asshole because clearly she's been enabled and while it's mostly her fault and she needs to learn, it doesn't sound like she took it badly. You didn't say she's mad, or blaming anyone, just that she's embarrassed. That's an acceptable response, sounds like she's taking responsibility for the issue herself even though she hasn't fixed it yet.\n\nOverall, your family needs to stop acting like she's a toddler who has to be taken care of. Stop enabling her. There's more ways than she has tried so far, to wake up. She hasn't tried every option. She needs to keep searching for solutions. It's ridiculous that the entire family has to cater to her bad habit to the extent where everyone's fighting because of her own mistake.\n\n\nedit: I'm sure what I said was probably clear already but just to clarify further: it sounds like the three of you are arguing about this situation while treating your sister like some uninvolved third party. As if she's a dog who wasn't let out and you guys are arguing about whose responsibility she is now that she's shit on the carpet.

I wanted so bad to be able to wake up like everyone else. And then when I finally got tested at 20 years old, it turns out it was a hormone issue all along. My parents felt so guilty when they found out it was a medical issue and not me being lazy - so many arguments were caused by me not being able to wake up and it all could have been avoided if only I had been diagnosed earlier.", "Nya", "I hated getting up and always left it to the last minute, but I still did it.

You purposely put your teenage sister in a position where you knew she would fail, be embarrassed, and possibly get in trouble for missing school. If you had told her you weren't going to do it, that might be different. She could have prepared in some way. She is used to having a backup, though, and you took that away without telling her. How is that teaching her anything other than that she can't trust you?\n\nAlso, even if your sister has been to the doctor, there are sleep disorders that primary care doctors don't know anything about. It's not focused on too much in med school and it's not their specialty. I'm not saying your sister definitely has one. Maybe she's just a deep sleeper. Even so, you describe someone who has acknowledged a problem and tried multiple solutions. Clearly this is hard for her, and she's trying.

You didn't even give your sister a chance to take responsibility, you just left her there without warning, whether she's 15 or not. You let AJ down, let your mom down and let your sister down.\n\nNext time if you wanna teach someone a lesson: tell them about the lesson and don't just dump it on them to make it someone else's problem (in this case: your mom's).

She's well beyond the age of needing to be woken up from school, especially when, according to OP, she wakes up and turns her alarms off just to go back to sleep. So why does AJ need to wake her up if she's doing that on her own? If they actually want to help Kylie, they'd be teaching her how to be independent and self-sufficient, not enabling her bad habits. Mom and AJ have set her up for this, so they're on the hook for it. \n\n>AJ \u201ctook it up\u201d because AJ isn\u2019t an AH.\n\nWhen Kylie was younger, that was the case, yeah. But  not at 15. There should be no reason for him to continue to treat her like a child-he's taking on a responsibility she no longer needs as a teenager. At this point, he's not helping her, he's hindering her. OP has a point: what is Kylie going to do when she no longer has her mom or brothers around to wake her up for school or a job?"]}
