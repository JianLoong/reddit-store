Waking up on time because you know you'll miss the bus and be absent from school is accountability that a fifteen year old should be able to recognize imo.\n\nBut yeah, you definitely should have informed your Mom and brother so they wouldn't panic.", "NTA. My Bonus Son was the worst with this problem. I tried everything I could think to do but nothing worked. The situation miraculously resolved itself when his boss told him if he was late again, he was fired. He was so indignant telling the story-he even said \"Boss knows I have a truck payment \" lol. He then asked if partner and I 'had his back' ie would make his payments. We said, \"Absolutely not\"! That was 7 years ago and, to my knowledge,  he's never been late since. When actual consequences were on the line, he got himself moving without any help!", "NTA\n\nI've lived with several people who have never learned how to get up on their own because there is always someone who enables their poor behavior. \n\nI don't know if this stems from childhood or not. By the time I was 11 I had a paper route and I was getting up on my own for school and work. I am to the point my body often wakes up on it's own around the time I need with or without a clock.\n\nI entertained some of these people, but it gets old. It's frustrating and annoying having someone rely on you getting them up and then acting like assholes when you don't.\n\nYou get them an \"Atomic Alarm Clock\", they sell them on Amazon, they have a decibel level of 80+ and come with a mattress vibrator to shake the bed as well.", "NTA.

I'm curious to see if things have changed since the sleep-in.", "INFO: Why don't the other apps work for her? Is she sleeping through the alarm or just being lazy?", "YTA - not because it wasn't a good lesson for your sister but because of the impacts on AJ and your Mum. AJ who you admit has a lot on his plate had one night off at a party and had a chance to be a teenager. But he still felt the responsibility so he asked you to do it. Ok it looks like you didn't agree totally and he should have assumed you were going to be a AH to him about it. Your mother got a call from the school that her daughter was lost and missing and it affected her so badly she was off trying to recover the rest of the day.\n\nWhat AJ has learned is that he can't ever expect you to step up to help him or your Mum out. And that you don't consider the full consequences of your actions. Don't be surprised or upset if he continues to treat you and your single sister the same because you both are children. And poor guy, he can't even have one night off without having the responsibility of looking after his siblings.", "Unpopular opinion, but NTA. Tell both AJ and Kaylie that if he wants to wake her up all her life, that is on him, but you will not do that.\n\nKaylie is 15 and of she has trouble getting up (I have too) she should start to think of solutions.\n\nI also do not think you are TA for not send a message to your mom.

You didn't tell everyone you were planning to make your sister learn the hard way. You showed your brother that you are unreliable (he expected you to help him with this wake up) and you can't be counted on, you let others down intentionally, unlike your sister.\n\nThey are right, it won't kill you to do it. It's quite strange that you are so eager to throw your sister under the bus just because she isn't like you. It sounds like you have much bigger problems than your sister.", "Nope NTA.

You absolutely suck for not telling everyone that you wouldn\u2019t do it. Your poor freaking mom. For scaring her like that, you should definitely be ashamed of yourself. Kaylie sucks for not taking responsibility for her own actions. At 15 she either has a medical condition that needs to be addressed or she needs to grow the heck up.

Your mom and brother are at fault for enabling her and acting like she's an elementary schooler who needs to be managed, who can't control her own actions and choices and habits. Like she's innocent and isn't playing a role in this and therefore shame on you for not helping to shoulder the responsibility of managing her. No. She's 15.

Come on.\n\nYou're partially at fault because you knew this would happen and didn't warn your mother prior--it costs nothing to be kind and anyone might guess this would happen and it'll scare a mother to get a call like that from the school. Your brother is just wanted to enjoy some time being young, and this got ruined for him too. Not your fault, but it costs nothing to be kind.\n\nI'm also not saying your sister is the asshole because clearly she's been enabled and while it's mostly her fault and she needs to learn, it doesn't sound like she took it badly.

That's an acceptable response, sounds like she's taking responsibility for the issue herself even though she hasn't fixed it yet.\n\nOverall, your family needs to stop acting like she's a toddler who has to be taken care of. Stop enabling her. There's more ways than she has tried so far, to wake up. She hasn't tried every option. She needs to keep searching for solutions.
