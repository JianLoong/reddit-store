We used to play together as kids and im talking like elementary school so it was nothing serious. I barely remember anything except thinking she was kinda weird and we stopped hanging out as we got older. No big deal. Except my mom is the definition of a hopeless romantic and was convinced that she had a starring role in one of those shitty romcoms shes obsessed with. Except it\u2019s not fiction it\u2019s my life she\u2019s interfering with. Idgaf how many times she drops hints about how compatible we are or some other bullshit, it wasn\u2019t happening. I told her to get a grip and leave me alone. That was during summer\n\nI came back early for winter break and guess who just happens to show up a day later? Her friend. She\u2019s the same as i remember. Loud, nosy and really fucking annoying. Idk if my mom told her their little project was over but clearly not considering some of the painfully obvious shit she was saying. I couldn\u2019t exactly walk away so she sat across from me and interrogated me for a while. After the second time she asked if I met someone in college I just gave up and lied. Then she kept pressing me about what exactly my type was. At this point my mom had left the room for a minute since our dog started whining to be let out so I just thought fuck it and said \u201cnot the size of a linebacker\u201d. Probably a good time to mention that her daughter always struggled with weight. Was it an AH move? I guess. But at least it shut her up\n\nShe left quickly after that and I thought it would finally be over except she called my mom later that night and I got my ass chewed out big time. Turns out the whole reason they did this was because the girl told her mom she had a crush on me ages ago and the women were immediately obsessed with the idea of childhood friends falling in love despite the fact we were never even friends to begin with. Hell she could\u2019ve just told me that shit herself instead of involving her mom\n\nSo yeah. Now my moms pissed and my older sisters have been calling me an sexist dickhead for the last few days but my dad agrees with me. Even if what I said was wrong I think it\u2019s fair to say middle aged women need a hobby that doesn\u2019t involve playing matchmaker with their kids like it\u2019s a fucking movie\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671141978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmxkzj/aita_for_telling_my_mom_and_her_friend_to_stop/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dude, literally all you had to do was say \u201cnot your daughter.\u201d  Or \u201care you hitting on me?  Cause this is getting kinda creepy.\u201d  Or \u201cnone of your business.\u201d  *Anything* but picking on someone who wasn\u2019t there to defend herself, and who might well be over the crush and equally sick of her mom\u2019s meddling at this point, too.", "ESH \n\nYour mom is being really obnoxious and shouldn't be meddling.  But your comment was completely out of line and unacceptable.", "ESH, I get it, they're hounding you and it's annoying. (As a mom myself, I don't understand pushing your kid to date someone) Your inference about her daughter being overweight was unnecessarily cruel, though.", "ESH. Your mom seems to have taken her social cues straight out of a sitcom, and based on your response, so have you. No one sounds like an adult in this story.", "NTA. Their behaviour is intrusive and quite creepy. You told your mother to stop doing this but she ignored you. She then enabled her friend to harass you. You were obviously very uncomfortable but they don't care because they live in a fantasy world where everything should happen to suit them. Don't listen to people who are annoyed at your comment but have nothing to say about the provocation that led up to it.\n\nEdit: the girl wasn't there so she wouldn't have known about the comment unless someone decided to tell her. The sisters only got involved because someone decided to create more drama instead of just shutting up.", "Im going to go with NTA.  It's definitely on the edge but you basically did everything you should have done already.  You told your mom to lay off.  You acted disinterested.  You made it extremely clear you weren't interested.  Making her think you're a bastard is really the last resort.", "Your mom and her friend's behavior was violating and creepy. They blatantly disrespected your boundaries by pushing her on you when you already clearly expressed your disinterest. Absolutely NTA.", "ESH\n\nI get you snapped and didn't want to be bothered anymore,  but calling out her weight like that isn't necessary and is kind of rude.  \n\nYou could have just been honest and said you didn't like her and you didn't want to be pressed further. \n\nYour mom should butt out of your romantic life,  especially since you don't want her playing matchmaker.", "ESH. Nothing to see here.", "ESH. Obviously your mom and her friend suck. But the friends daughter literally has done nothing wrong so why'd you have to insult her like that. You couldve said something like \"Not someone with a mother like you\" or literally anything not about the daughter.", "NTA - she didnt take the hint so you spelled it out. Anyone saying Y.T.A probably has some body issues of their own and taking the anger out on you.", "ESH. Mom should have left it alone, however, never comment on someone's weight. That's just fucking rude and uncalled for. There was plenty of other ways you could have handled it.", "nope, NTA here.  While you could have been softer in your response, they were hard pushing you and ya finally snapped.  No worries.", "NTA\n\nYou're entitled to have whatever preferences you what. If that's sexist then every person on the planet is a sexist. Anyone who tells you they don't have a preference is a liar.\n\nI think they pushed you and you gave them an answer.", "You could very easily have told the girl's mom in simple terms that you had no interest in dating her daughter, but instead you chose to insult her. You don't know exactly what story your mom spun - for all you know she had told her friend that you wanted to date her daughter, yet you're effectively blaming her and being unpleasant about it for good measure. So YTA, but your mom is the AH as well for ignoring what you said in the first place.", "ESH\n\nThe only reason you suck is because of your comment.\n\n>said \u201cnot the size of a linebacker\u201d.\n\nThat really wasn't called for.\n\nBoth women suck because they are trying to force you into a relationship you don't want or have interest in.", "YTA.  Did you really even need to ask?   I\u2019m sorry, but mothers will always try to play matchmakers.  It\u2019s just something that both men and women (yes, we hate it too) have learned to deal with.  Saying something so mean and cruel to the mother of that girl was awful of you.  You could have just described someone totally opposite of her daughter. Dark hair, brown eyes, who loves running with me.  Instead of light hair, blue eyes, someone not as active.  You were purposely cruel and you know it", "YTA! Your mom and her friend are annoying, but you did not have to insult the girl - who is innocent in all this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's obvious why your mom and her friend are so wrong, so I won't bother going into detail.\n\nYou, however... your response was both immature and cruel to someone who wasn't even there to defend herself. Also, just because she mentioned a childhood crush doesn't mean she wants her mother's meddling, so don't blame her for this. \n\nIt wasn't the most egregious thing in the world, but I hope you spend some time considering how you think and speak about others-- okay, so she was weird when you were kids, and now she's overweight. She made you uncomfortable once and now shes unattractive, I get it. But the disdain with which you speak of her is unbecoming. \n\nYou're getting to the age where it's time for you to start actively practicing empathy for others if you want to have a decent life with decent people around you-- consider how she feels. She probably knows she is/was weird, and she probably knows she's overweight and most people find that unattractive, and she probably knows that her meddling mother is an embarrassment. She is probably finding this quite a bit more painful than you are.", "ESH you said that specifically to be mean.

Unless they specifically said it's her daughter she was talking about.", "YTA. Nothing in your post shows that you needed to be nasty to stop this woman. Anyway, it all sounds blown way out of proportion. This woman wasn't \"interfering with your life;\" she was just being irritating and pushy. People deal with that kind of thing daily, using strategies like getting up and leaving. I'm having a hard time understanding why you found this all so horrible; people post actual terrible stuff on this site without resorting to the amount of cursing you seem to think it requires. Sounds like you're just a hothead.", "I agree with this ESH.", "Especially since it's entirely likely that the daughter is just as fed up with it as OP is!
