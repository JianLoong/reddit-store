Grow up. You can disagree and think whatever you want about Mel's passing, but why rub salt in the wounds of those who are already mourning?\n\n> My dad added fuel to my fire saying at least I won\u2019t ever have to look at my kid in a casket from dying from a meth overdose\n\nAt least we know where you got your shitty attitude from.", "YTA. Using meth laced with fentanyl and dying of a heart attack at 23 *is* a tragic accident and it's *extremely* fucked up that you felt the need to tear down your dead cousin in front of your grieving grandmother *at his own fucking funeral.*\n\nWhether what you said is true or not show some fucking tact. What was gained? What would you have lost had you kept your mouth shut? Seems like all you accomplished is needlessly upsetting your grandmother on the day she was burying her 23-year-old grandson. Like Christ dude, I get it, you want everyone to recognize you're the better grandkid; well congrats, he's dead, you're not, you win. Let it go.", "YTA\n\nA few things to consider OP:\n\nWhy is it important to you that others share your viewpoint on Mel? It sounds like it rubs you the wrong way that someone did not condemn him for his actions?\n\nIs unconditional love and forgiveness for mistakes and bad choices something you're missing in your life? If so, explore those feelings. Talk with your close ones.\n\nUnconditional love and drug addiction is a complex and sometimes nasty process. It's hard to say what is supporting and what is enabling. No matter what, there is an universal rule - you don't speak ill of the dead at their funeral. If you can't hold that, don't show up.", "YTA - why are speaking ill of the dead? To piss off people who loved him? Reeks of jealousy.", "YTA and obviously jealous of your grandmother\u2019s relationship with your cousin. And your father was completely out of line. You\u2019re lucky no one got physical with you or him.", "YTA\n\nIt's likely that everyone who cared knew that he died from an OD.\n\nWhy did you feel compelled to make a public announcement at his funeral of all places?", "YTA.  People misuse the idea that you shouldn't badmouth the dead.  You are allowed to acknowledge how people hurt you.\n\nBut... not this.  Your grandmother didn't lie.  He may well have been too smart for his own mind -  I have met people who got into drugs because of that.  He did have health problems - addiction is a health problem.  And he did die of a heart attack, brought on by meth and fentanyl.\n\nYou had no reason to add context at the funeral.", "YTA you don't do that at a funeral.", "ESH \n\nThere's no need for your grandma to be making up stories at the funeral, but you also don't need to be jumping in to correct her. It sucks she enabled him to death, but pointing it out at the funeral isn't going to bring him back. Your dad sucks too.", "YTA - It was a funeral. There was no reason to cause drama like that.", "YTA there was no reason to do that. none at all you just wanted people to think badly of your cousin.\n\nedit: at his own funeral no less that's such a terrible thing to do. its a terrible thing to do no matter what but really at the funeral there are so many things wrong with that.", "Yta - he is tragic. He died at 23 before he could ever get his life together and do something you (and your sanctomonious father) would be proud of. You should apologize and hope they forgive you. And that you never do have a kid who struggles with drug addiction.", "YTA. Your grandma knows the truth about Mel. Denial is common in these kinds of situations, I've seen it myself with a drug-addicted cousin and his mom. She's hurting right now because she lost someone she loved. There was no good reason for you to say what you said. A little empathy during a time of loss won't cost you much.", "ESH. Greif is hard. Emotions are high. everyone sucks here.\n\nThey are enablers and in denial, but time and place. The funeral is not the time or place.\n\nHow old are you?\n\n>she was telling a family member \n\nInfo needed here. It's not your place to air dirty laundry. If the family member is distant, its okay to lie and just say it was an accident. If it was a closer family member, they should probably know the truth. Either way - it probably wasnt for you to decide. you might be the AH for this.\n\n>and Mel is not some sort of a f ing tragic hero.\n\nTime and place. THIS was the kid's FUNERAL. Let them live the fantasy. Yes, years down the line, its okay to correct them. but not during the funeral.\n\n>My dad added fuel to my fire saying at least I won\u2019t ever have to look at my kid in a casket from dying from a meth overdose. \n\nYour dad is an icon. I love this for him lol.", "YTA You had no reason to say what you said, it wasn't helpful, or constructive and only served to make other people feel bad about themselves when they're already grieving. Regardless of your personal feelings, there was no reason you needed to do that at someone's funeral. You can believe whatever you want about your cousin but you should apologize to both your grandmother and the boy's mom, it was cold-hearted what you said during a time that's already difficult.", "Your grandmother was lying, you started an argument that was completely unnecessary, and your dad added gasoline to a raging inferno.\n\nESH", "Was what you said technically correct? Maybe, I don't know, I don't have the full story. Does badmouthing him *at his funeral* make you an asshole? Abso-fucking-lutely. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nObviously your grandma was aware. If he was that much of an addict maybe other people knew as well. You can definitely disagree, either in private or at a later time.\n\nBut at the funeral? Interrupting a loving speech from his grandmother to say he was \u2018dead before he even got to the hospital\u2019. Jeez\n\nGet a grip.", "Yta why does it make you feel better tearing down your dead cousin. You that jealous?", "ESH. Really not your place to say this here but at the same time lying about how the person died is kinda dumb. People say that you have nothing to gain by exposing the truth but all they gain by lying is just not having to explain the person was a drug addict and it killed them. Which if we are there to grieve the death of someone I think you should probably say how they died correctly.  If the death isn't the time for truth then when is?\n\nI am pretty biased as I dont have much sympathy for drug users.  Many in the family have stolen from others to get their fix.\n\nStill rude though OP. I would have taken the family harassment and just not went at all if you felt that way about this person.", "YTA - it\u2019s Mel\u2019s funeral. Mel doing drugs doesn\u2019t mean his life didn\u2019t matter. Your grandma\u2019s grief is real and valid. It\u2019s understandable that she didn\u2019t want to disclose his drug use because the stigma surrounding addicts could be used to try to invalidate her grief and diminish the worth of his life, which no one wants for someone they love. Mel is DEAD. Why do you care what the stories about him are after his death? If it\u2019s a competition, congratulations you won. But there\u2019s no need to deprive your family of their comfort in their grief. Also your dad is a major dick.", "You all need to learn how to behave in public. If your nuclear family holds so much ill will against your cousin, you should not have attended the funeral. Your cousin made some very serious mistakes in his life, but what do you gain by embarrassing your grandmother and belittling your cousin at their own funeral? Does it make you feel better of yourself or superior in some way?", "YTA Don\u2019t you have any empathy? That was totally unnecessary. Your father is just as big an asshole. What\u2019s wrong with you lot?", "Yta why bother? Dudes dead.  You did nothing to change grandma's opinion of him.", "YTA \n\nAT HIS FUCKING FUNERAL THO? Come on man, this is awful! Why did you even go? Here is the thing, you did that to tarnish his name and \u201cshow your grandma\u201d and your dad is an AH too! Y\u2019all are gross af for that. I can\u2019t even believe you wrote that shit out and still didn\u2019t realize \u2026\u2026. Wtf man!", "YTA. It\u2019s not uncommon for those grieving to lie when OD or suicide is involved, and calling your grandma out like that didn\u2019t benefit anyone. You and your dad both are the AH in this.", "YTA. Come on, man. Is a funeral the time and place to work out the family issues? Plus, was your grandmother really fooling anyone? Usually everyone knows why a person like that dies at the tender age of 23. I get why you were feeling like the funeral was a scene from Crazytown but it sounds like you took your anger out at the wrong time. Understandable but still an AH move. Sorry. And sorry for your loss.", "YTA- that was something that could've waited until after the funeral, at least. He was a troubled young man that could've had a better support system. Your dad was no better; what he said was entirely out of line at the time.", "ESH I don\u2019t think they should be lying and clearly ignoring the serious problems your cousin had. You clearly just shouldn\u2019t have gone", "YTA, it was totally unnecessary for you to do that.\n\nIt kind of sounds like you are jealous of your dead cousin to me.\n\nIt sucks he died, did you feel better by being selfish and speaking ill of someone that others genuinely loved? People aren't perfect, it's still a tragedy when someone loses their life to drug addiction.", "Look I'm in a pretty unique position where I can understand this. \n\nMy uncle accidentally overdosed and my grandfather committed suicide both before I was 13. They both had issues with addiction and I still struggle when family members talk about them like they were perfect. \n\nMy grandmother would tell people that they both had heart attacks. Now she did have dementia, but she started saying that long before. it was a way to make her grief hurt less. I was never gonna be the one to correct her. \n\nI get it. It's a special kind of pain when the living refuse to acknowledge the sins of the dead, but sometimes you just have to let it go. (Especially at the FUNERAL good lord.) You sound very young to me so take this as a learning experience, people grieve. It's not always the way we think they should, but sometimes the only thing we can do is let them. \n\nYTA. I hope you don't have to go through this again, but addiction is a disease and grief isn't always reasonable.", "YTA so what if his cause of death isn\u2019t explicitly stated? Unless it\u2019s for medical purposes then it shouldn\u2019t matter. And more so he probably was a troubled kid but you- and your dad just have terrible attitudes and clearly no empathy", "ESH\n\nSTFU, especially in that context. And your grandmother straight up fucking killed him with her enabling behaviour. She should have helped him get help, not helped him get high.\n\nYou're TA, but not nearly on her level. She is abhorrent.", "YTA. Your timing was wildly appropriate bordering on cruel. JFC.", "YTA. Look your grandma knows. It's his funeral. It isn't the most appropriate time to pull that.", "ESH. This story has a definite bias all the way through but from the info provided your grandmother should not be lashing out at you and bad mouthing you to your parents for relaying facts (the level of AH here is dependant on OPs age) \n\nHowever, being an addict does not make your cousin a bad person and it's highly unlikely you know true reasons behind that addiction. None of this is your business unless the person asked you directly about the death. You offering up these corrections unsolicited in a private convo between your grandmother and someone else is inappropriate at best. It's a funeral where people are mourning the loss of your cousin who died at 23 from an accidental overdose. What did this fight accomplish even if it was the truth? They loved him just as much as they always did and are actively grieving him. Reminding them about the tragic way he died is just rubbing salt in the wound (and it sounds like this is what you wanted). \n\n I don't know where this anger towards your cousin is coming from but let it go. He's dead. Live your life.", "YTA. Funerals are for the living and grieving family members. They aren\u2019t the place to air a families dirty laundry. You and your father behaved horribly. With zero empathy or compassion. Why even bother going to the funeral if you\u2019re just going to be an ass? And are you that jealous of your dead cousin that you literally needed to insert yourself into that conversation. I hope you family has more compassion for you when it comes time for you to need it in life than you showed your grandmother and aunt.", ">at least I won\u2019t ever have to look at my kid in a casket from dying from a meth overdose.\n\nHoly shit what is wrong with your family?!
