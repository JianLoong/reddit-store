If so, explore those feelings. Talk with your close ones.\n\nUnconditional love and drug addiction is a complex and sometimes nasty process. It's hard to say what is supporting and what is enabling. No matter what, there is an universal rule - you don't speak ill of the dead at their funeral. If you can't hold that, don't show up.", "YTA - why are speaking ill of the dead?

People misuse the idea that you shouldn't badmouth the dead.  You are allowed to acknowledge how people hurt you.\n\nBut... not this.  Your grandmother didn't lie.  He may well have been too smart for his own mind -  I have met people who got into drugs because of that.  He did have health problems - addiction is a health problem.

Denial is common in these kinds of situations, I've seen it myself with a drug-addicted cousin and his mom. She's hurting right now because she lost someone she loved.

Really not your place to say this here but at the same time lying about how the person died is kinda dumb. People say that you have nothing to gain by exposing the truth but all they gain by lying is just not having to explain the person was a drug addict and it killed them. Which if we are there to grieve the death of someone I think you should probably say how they died correctly.  If the death isn't the time for truth then when is?\n\nI am pretty biased as I dont have much sympathy for drug users.

Mel is DEAD. Why do you care what the stories about him are after his death? If it\u2019s a competition, congratulations you won.

It\u2019s not uncommon for those grieving to lie when OD or suicide is involved, and calling your grandma out like that didn\u2019t benefit anyone. You and your dad both are the AH in this.", "YTA. Come on, man. Is a funeral the time and place to work out the family issues? Plus, was your grandmother really fooling anyone? Usually everyone knows why a person like that dies at the tender age of 23. I get why you were feeling like the funeral was a scene from Crazytown but it sounds like you took your anger out at the wrong time. Understandable but still an AH move. Sorry. And sorry for your loss.", "YTA- that was something that could've waited until after the funeral, at least. He was a troubled young man that could've had a better support system. Your dad was no better; what he said was entirely out of line at the time.", "ESH I don\u2019t think they should be lying and clearly ignoring the serious problems your cousin had. You clearly just shouldn\u2019t have gone", "YTA, it was totally unnecessary for you to do that.\n\nIt kind of sounds like you are jealous of your dead cousin to me.\n\nIt sucks he died, did you feel better by being selfish and speaking ill of someone that others genuinely loved? People aren't perfect, it's still a tragedy when someone loses their life to drug addiction.", "Look I'm in a pretty unique position where I can understand this. \n\nMy uncle accidentally overdosed and my grandfather committed suicide both before I was 13. They both had issues with addiction and I still struggle when family members talk about them like they were perfect. \n\nMy grandmother would tell people that they both had heart attacks. Now she did have dementia, but she started saying that long before. it was a way to make her grief hurt less. I was never gonna be the one to correct her. \n\nI get it. It's a special kind of pain when the living refuse to acknowledge the sins of the dead, but sometimes you just have to let it go. (Especially at the FUNERAL good lord.) You sound very young to me so take this as a learning experience, people grieve. It's not always the way we think they should, but sometimes the only thing we can do is let them. \n\nYTA. I hope you don't have to go through this again, but addiction is a disease and grief isn't always reasonable.", "YTA so what if his cause of death isn\u2019t explicitly stated? Unless it\u2019s for medical purposes then it shouldn\u2019t matter. And more so he probably was a troubled kid but you- and your dad just have terrible attitudes and clearly no empathy", "ESH\n\nSTFU, especially in that context. And your grandmother straight up fucking killed him with her enabling behaviour. She should have helped him get help, not helped him get high.\n\nYou're TA, but not nearly on her level. She is abhorrent.", "YTA. Your timing was wildly inappropriate bordering on cruel. JFC.", "YTA. Look your grandma knows. It's his funeral. It isn't the most appropriate time to pull that.", "ESH. This story has a definite bias all the way through but from the info provided your grandmother should not be lashing out at you and bad mouthing you to your parents for relaying facts (the level of AH here is dependant on OPs age) \n\nHowever, being an addict does not make your cousin a bad person and it's highly unlikely you know true reasons behind that addiction. None of this is your business unless the person asked you directly about the death. You offering up these corrections unsolicited in a private convo between your grandmother and someone else is inappropriate at best. It's a funeral where people are mourning the loss of your cousin who died at 23 from an accidental overdose. What did this fight accomplish even if it was the truth? They loved him just as much as they always did and are actively grieving him. Reminding them about the tragic way he died is just rubbing salt in the wound (and it sounds like this is what you wanted). \n\n I don't know where this anger towards your cousin is coming from but let it go. He's dead. Live your life.", "YTA. Funerals are for the living and grieving family members. They aren\u2019t the place to air a families dirty laundry. You and your father behaved horribly.

And yes, she IS very mentally ill and that isn\u2019t her fault. But she\u2019s also had all the treatment money can buy and made zero effort to change. She hurts and abuses people, to the point where she\u2019s permanently damaged people I love. She manipulates and lies to get whatever she wants. But on her death she will be a martyr and even though I do genuinely love her and wish she could just get better and not do this shit anymore, it will honestly also sicken me to hear people talk about her like she was an innocent martyr.\n\nSo I get it.

Would I be frustrated and upset? Yes. But it\u2019s not the time or place.

You can be reasonably healthy after a heart attack, because your WHOLE heart doesn't die, but parts of it did, and that's not healing.  \n\n\nA heart attack can lead to a cardiac arrest - if the whole heart dies, game over - that's an arrest that ain't gonna un-arrest.
