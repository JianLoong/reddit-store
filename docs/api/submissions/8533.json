My parents told me they could not financially help me because they have another child now. I admit, I resented that. I had to work and go to college. For the first two years I couldn't get into university dorms so I had to rent, which was much more expensive. I can't count how many times I hadn't eaten for 2-3 days. It was horrible and I consider that the worst experience of my life. It got easier after I got into dorms, but I still couldn't afford anything extra, like, going to a party or such.\n\nIn all this years I slowly distanced myself from my parents and I don't see Chris as my brother. To this day we see each other max 2 times a year, even though we live 25mins away. They don't even know I married my partner.\n\nThis happened at Christmas dinner. In the middle of dinner my parents told me that Chris is going to university in the same city I live and if he could stay with me. They would pay for rent and expenses. Now, I live in the townhouse in the middle of all faculties. I'm in prime spot. I don't rent rooms, but if I would, rent would be highest in the city. I was triggered when my parents said they would pay for him, so I said that they can't afford to rent a room in my place and to look elsewhere. All family there were shocked by my response, and my parents were somewhat taken aback.\n\nSince then a couple of family members told me I'm an AH for not helping my family. My parents texted me to reconsider and help my brother and that he is very upset his big brother wont help him. I told them he is their son, but he is not my brother and I have no obligation towards him. Even Chris texted me and begged me to reconsider but I just ignore him.

You didn't specify but I am assuming that you are in the US and that their income made you ineligible for financial aid despite the fact that they declined to provide that \"anticipated family contribution\".\n\nThey should not expect you to have a sibling bond with Chris (who I do feel bad for-none of this is his fault and who knows what they've told him to explain your absence from his life without owning up to their own failings ) and it was an outrageously manipulative move to make their proposal about Chris living with you at a holiday meal, with an audience.  Putting you on the spot like that was vile, even without the slap in the face about their helping Chris with college in ways they would not help you. \n\nEven if you were crazy about Chris and had a good relationship with your folks,  you still wouldn't be obligated to take a teenager into your home. That's a lot to ask under the best of circumstances and under the circumstances you're describing,  it is unthinkable.\n\nYou may want to tell them the real reason and explain that you didn't want to air that laundry at the table.

Living with someone is a big deal, whether they are family or not. There are many, many ways for roommate situations to go horribly badly, even when all the people involved are basically good people. When one is a teenager just starting college, and the other is a married adult who has been forced to support himself for a decade, that is not likely to be a good roommate match.\n\nBut you don't consider him to be your brother, and that is largely due to the choices that your parents made. I know a couple who adopted four young children (long story--it started out as one, then a second 2 years later, then things happened and it became four overnight) while their biological daughter was in college. But the couple made sure that their older daughter knew that she was valued and loved. They continue to help support her while she was in college (despite the fact that they hadn't planned on having the expense of *four* more kids) and she still came home for holidays/lived at home for the first year post-college until she found a place of her own. And while she obviously doesn't have the same sibling bond with the young ones that they have with each other, she's almost like a beloved aunt to them. And that's because the couple never acted like her needs were any less important than the other children.\n\nNTA. Not because they *asked* about Chris living with you (that would have been N. A. H.) but because they are refusing to accept your \"no\" as an answer.\n\nAnyone who is still giving you a hard time should be told in no uncertain terms, \"My parents didn't care that I went hungry when I was Chris's age, and they didn't even know that I was married.

It\u2019s admirable that your parents adopted a seven year old, but they had a 17 year commitment to you and they neglected you.

I think your partner needs to understand how this situation would be pretty bad for your mental health and could feed the resentment even more.

The fact they see you 2x a year but don't know you're married also means they've never bothered asking and haven't made an effort to get to know your partner.  The thing with Chris - no he's not 'your brother' but he's just as innocent in this as you are ie he's a kid with parents who made plans that suited THEM just like they did with you - for You it was 'you're on your own we don't have money' for Chris it's 'We don't have much money live with your 'brother'  Also it's likely he doesn't know what happened with you and your parents.  He's only gotten their side of it and he may genuinely consider you his 'big brother', no that doesn't mean you have to reciprocate but it may just lend some empathy to him. \n\nYour feelings are valid but even if you don't want Chris living with you perhaps at some point you& spouse could be the adults he knows in the City ie somebody to have lunch with to tell him where to go/not go around town, and call incase of emergency.  He might be a decent young man that you & partner could have a relationship independently from your parents,  NOT as a 'brother' but as a young friend.", "NTA I've lived that college experience when you're justifying to the pence every single thing you buy and I understand where you're coming from. \n\nEither they saved for college for you and then reallocated that money to support their new son, or they didn't save and sprung that on you  at 17.

This is your family, so as much as they are entitled to an opinion, you should have final say. \nYour parents or Chris are more than capable of a plan b. \nAnd remember, all you had to say was, \u201cno. It\u2019s not possible to have him or anyone else live with us.\u201d Sadly I think offering up that \u201crent would be too expensive\u201d gave them hope or the glimmer of opportunity, that it\u2019s possible but with a price tag, unfortunately, which will lead to the barrage of calls and texts you don\u2019t want, thinking bulling you into it will be the ticket to getting what they want, your feeling be damned.", "Yes, you may need to let her in more so she can understand your perspective. I made this mistake with my husband always pushing back for a better relationship with his family but after 16 years together things have revealed themselves. I don't push back anymore. I should have listen from the start and simply taken his word about his family.", "You make a very important point that needs to be brought home to OP\u2019s partner: Chris\u2019 presence with *hurt* him. I think OP is wise to set this boundary.", "I think it's tough. I don't know how they could really have a relationship. How would op explain what their parents did, when it involve him so closely, without making him feel badly.\n\n\"Hey when my parents decided to adopt you and provide for you and love you (seemingly a good thing in the brothers life) they decided to abdicate any responsibility for me and essentially abandon me. And I spent years reguarly unable to afford food for days at a time. Because of the  descion they made at a critical point in my life\"\n\nIt's not the brothers fault. The parents made a decision that was self serving (they chose to adopted and take on the expenses of another child) and left op to suffer the consequences. Because of by the timing op had few options available to them. Financial aid etc is based of parents income (I'm not sure what year that would be assessed where pre or post adoption) but that assement assumes that parents will be providing financially to the student. And the timing left op little time to make other plans. And left them without their parents as a knowledge resources, because the felt the could no longer trust or rely on them.", "Chris is kind of an AH for asking a total stranger to help him out and calling OP his \u201cbig brother,\u201d when he\u2019s not.", "FYI your partner needs to understand that you have a very different relationship with your family then they do. Send them to Dr Ramani's Youtube videos about shitty parents until they understand and stfu.", "25mins by car and highway. He doesn't have a drivers license or a car for that matter. It's about hour and a half by train and 20min walking.", "They\u2019re both the parents\u2019 \u201cactual child\u201d", "How is not taking in someone he hardly knows being an asshole to him?", "Yeah, my dad (divorced from my mom) never helped me at all with school. I had to pay my own way and work hard to get scholarships so I could go to grad school. I was on my own from 18 onward. My sister, on the other hand, received a totally different treatment and had her university paid for, and rent plus groceries paid as well. She is 5 years younger than me. My mom was a crappy parent and I think it influenced us differently. I was parentified and became super responsible. My sister was parented by myself often. My dad was worried about my sister as she was more of a dreamer and was less interested in school and degrees. So he helped her. I admit that I noticed the difference in care but at 18, I recognized my ability to work and get what I wanted with effort. It was super hard. I got up at 4am every day through university to go to work before my classes started. I worked each summer to earn enough for tuition. I busted my butt. I ate only pirogies during grad school. My sister had it eeeeaaasy and still does. But I don\u2019t resent my sister. It was my parents choice to spoil her and not me. I\u2019m now a parent myself and will never favour a child. I have a 5 month old. Hoping for another but I\u2019m an old fart. I started my family late in life as I wanted to make sure I could provide for them well. I\u2019m 40. I have 5 embryos on ice. I\u2019ll always treat my kids equally.", "Op didn't need to have a relationship with Chris. It was parents decision.  Even if OP was blood related, adults get to choose who they want in their lives.", "Yes, everyone invited contributed.", "Some of the ones I went to had money at the door if the drink was supplied, or you brought your own booze.\n\nBoth cost money.", "Yeah? You go out and buy alcohol at clubs and it's expensive", "The parents\u2019 son having done nothing wrong doesn\u2019t entitle him to a room in OP\u2019s home.", "How is it of benefit to OP to have a daily reminder of the reason he was left to starve through college, and watch that reason not have to have the same experience?\n\nIf OP can afford not to rent out his room this is detrimental, if anything.", "Why is he his brother? OP is the one who decides that, not his parents or a random on the Internet. They are not even related, and they see each other 2 times a year. OP doesn't consider him his family, and it doesn't matter what the parents and their child want.", "We are strangers. We lived together for 6 months until I moved out. We didn't have any communication. I don't know this kid at all. Frankly, I'm not interested in having a relationship with him.", "He is not entitled to a relationship with someone who doesn't want one, and who sees 2 times a year.", "It doesn\u2019t matter that he wants a relationship with OP. OP isn\u2019t obligated to give him one.", "It's not entitlement. My parents income still affected my ability to get state stipend. College is free here, but its still expected that parents pitch in for accomodation. Only if parents income is low enough you get state stipend. I got nothing. Plus we have a quota of hours student can work in a month. Sometimes I reached that quota in the middle of the month and couldn't until the next month started. That means students are limited in earnings and is the reason I starved so many times. All this time my parents played family with their new son. Hard to not resent that. And my partner(he) totally understands that.", "I'd say he values his family as much as they value him, so it's mutual. The younger kid can get on a job and fend for himself just as OP had to, I'd say that seems pretty fair.", "The parents adopted him, not op. The seemed to make no effort to bond them as a family, they actually actively did the opposite, they made it clear they wouldn't help op *because* they adopted, which it doesn't take any effort to *know* that would only create resentment. \n\nThey can't create and foster that resentment, then expect op to see their child as his brother, much less make room for him in his home.", "Sure, like the parents\u2019 bad actions of letting OP go days without eating instead of helping him out a little has the consequences of him not taking in the son they are willing to pay for things for.", "I think Chris is probably just parroting what he's been told by his parents for a decade.", "I think the poster above is saying that Chris is caught in the middle. He likely has no idea what OP went through because of their parents who in my mind basically abandoned him when he started at uni.\n\nBut the parents bear the full responsibility for the estrangement from OP and OP\u2019s justified decision to say no. It\u2019s incredulous the the parents seem to have no idea what OP went through emotionally and physically because of the adoption. \n\nOP you\u2019ve done nothing wrong and NTA. But it\u2019s possible Chris has no idea what happened.", "IDK, man, we always just walked in, and were handed some cups.", "What do clubs have to do with college parties?", "Why is he his brother?\nCuz they share the same parents\nThey see each other 2 times a year?\nYeah sounds like the brother is an innocent victim of the feud between OP and his parents. OP even admits to feeling resent, even though the brother has done absolutely nothing worng. \n\nNo one is blameless here", "Man, you're not the asshole for not wanting to rent out a room but you sound Hella bitter. It isn't  a great look tbh.", "So he was 7 when you met and you conpeltley ignored him for 6 months? You think that paints you in a good light?", "People love the word \"entitled\" on this site. No one is entitled to anything, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be nice.", "Pretty similar here in the US with regards to students working on campus which is why man worked off campus. On campus jobs generally have a set limit of how many hours you can work.", "What makes you think they didn't value their son? By his own admission he was well taken care of and had everything he needed in life. they just couldn't at the time help with post secondary education which isn't anything new in this world. Didn't mean they didn't love him because they couldn't. Op just assumed they would pay for it. It didn't even mean they would or would not help with a bill or 2. Op just got pissed and basically cut ties over it. Why would the parents even have an inkling to want to help when their child has basically gone NC with them?\n\nAs I said op doesn't have to help but with that comes consequences for said actions when parents decide their eol wants, op won't be poa for anything and odds are everything will be left to the adopted brother and op will be sitting there pissed off a out it.", "What makes you think they knew? He was lc at that point", "Perhaps. At the same time, he has had almost no contact with the OP.", "Oh, you were that kind of student.\n\nYou go to a house party, you bring something. Yes, you may be handed something when you walk through the door but you should also contibute to the stash unless the person throwing tells you it's in hand.", "I worded that wrong. We didn't have any communication when I moved out. I was nice and cordial with him while we lived together. My parents encouraged brotherly bonding but I put a stop to it.", "Why would he be nice to them when he was starving for three days at the time, the parents didnt help and he was denied scholarships because of their parents earnings? Again, he was starving and they didn't help, he doesn't see their child as his brother, so no, if he doesn't want to be nice, he shouldn't. You reap what you sow.", "To me it doesn't read like the parents tired very hard to keep the relationship with their older son or care how he's doing.... Until they realized it could be useful now. To be honest, I think OP wouldn't be getting much inheritance anyway, since he's got a career and a house already, and he never needed anything from them so he must be doing well, but the poor younger son doesn't have anyone else to take care of him, so they have to make sure he will have everything he needs", "Doesn't mean he hasn't been pining and fantasizing that someday he could form a genuine connection with the older sibling figure.\n\nThe parents told him they would set this up and got Chris's hopes up, with him not knowing the history, and now he might be feeling like it's somehow his fault or that he's undesireable in some way to the older sibling figure.\n\nI think OP should explain to Chris why he's hurt by the parents request and reassure him it's not his fault. It would be chill if OP could extend an olive branch to spend some time with Chris on OPs terms, but OP may never be emotionally available that way. It's an unfortunate situation, but I think the adopted child deserves to be spoken to as a individual person in the situation.", "and who knows what the parents are saying 'your brother is so busy in the city' etc.  OP might be polite when he does see them 2x a year.  Who knows what sort of trauma this little boy came into the family with, and who knows what the parents have done to make sure he's dealt with it.", "We tended to rotate hosting, and you paid your dues that way.", "But it goes both ways. Relationships aren't one way streets in adulthood it's 2 way streets.", "None of which, has anything to do with the OP.", "And OP couldn't afford to host, so rather than be a parasite, he just didn't go to parties.  Pretty honorable.", "So, you answered your own question.\n\nGoing to college parties costs money.", "Exactly, and here, parents aren't really trying to fix the relationship, just take advantage to benefit their younger son"]}
