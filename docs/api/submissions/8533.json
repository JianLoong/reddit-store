My parents told me they could not financially help me because they have another child now. I admit, I resented that. I had to work and go to college. For the first two years I couldn't get into university dorms so I had to rent, which was much more expensive. I can't count how many times I hadn't eaten for 2-3 days.

In the middle of dinner my parents told me that Chris is going to university in the same city I live and if he could stay with me. They would pay for rent and expenses.

All family there were shocked by my response, and my parents were somewhat taken aback.\n\nSince then a couple of family members told me I'm an AH for not helping my family. My parents texted me to reconsider and help my brother and that he is very upset his big brother wont help him. I told them he is their son, but he is not my brother and I have no obligation towards him. Even Chris texted me and begged me to reconsider but I just ignore him.

You were basically abandoned and you managed to get yourself through school.  You didn't specify but I am assuming that you are in the US and that their income made you ineligible for financial aid despite the fact that they declined to provide that \"anticipated family contribution\".\n\nThey should not expect you to have a sibling bond with Chris (who I do feel bad for-none of this is his fault and who knows what they've told him to explain your absence from his life without owning up to their own failings ) and it was an outrageously manipulative move to make their proposal about Chris living with you at a holiday meal, with an audience.  Putting you on the spot like that was vile, even without the slap in the face about their helping Chris with college in ways they would not help you. \n\nEven if you were crazy about Chris and had a good relationship with your folks,  you still wouldn't be obligated to take a teenager into your home. That's a lot to ask under the best of circumstances and under the circumstances you're describing,  it is unthinkable.\n\nYou may want to tell them the real reason and explain that you didn't want to air that laundry at the table.

Hold your ground", "In the first place, you would have no obligation to rent him a room even if you *did* consider him to be your brother. Living with someone is a big deal, whether they are family or not. There are many, many ways for roommate situations to go horribly badly, even when all the people involved are basically good people. When one is a teenager just starting college, and the other is a married adult who has been forced to support himself for a decade, that is not likely to be a good roommate match.\n\nBut you don't consider him to be your brother, and that is largely due to the choices that your parents made. I know a couple who adopted four young children (long story--it started out as one, then a second 2 years later, then things happened and it became four overnight) while their biological daughter was in college. But the couple made sure that their older daughter knew that she was valued and loved. They continue to help support her while she was in college (despite the fact that they hadn't planned on having the expense of *four* more kids) and she still came home for holidays/lived at home for the first year post-college until she found a place of her own. And while she obviously doesn't have the same sibling bond with the young ones that they have with each other, she's almost like a beloved aunt to them. And that's because the couple never acted like her needs were any less important than the other children.\n\nNTA. Not because they *asked* about Chris living with you (that would have been N. A. H.) but because they are refusing to accept your \"no\" as an answer.\n\nAnyone who is still giving you a hard time should be told in no uncertain terms, \"My parents didn't care that I went hungry when I was Chris's age, and they didn't even know that I was married.

Especially if your parents can\u2019t Even acknowledge the double standard and extreme hardship you had to go through that they could have helped alleviate. \n\nIt sounds like you barely have a relationship so you\u2019d be essentially housing a stranger (and an 18YO one at that who will likely want to go out, have friends over, and generally engage in college activities that you might not want in your home.", "NTA. It\u2019s admirable that your parents adopted a seven year old, but they had a 17 year commitment to you and they neglected you. Sure you were an adult, but if I thought my 18 year old was going hungry I\u2019d move heaven and earth to help them. You\u2019re right, you don\u2019t owe your parents or their child anything.

I think your partner needs to understand how this situation would be pretty bad for your mental health and could feed the resentment even more. Having a constant reminder of how your parents didn't support you but are paying rent for their other kid would suck really bad especially since they haven't really tried to mend the relationship with you in all those years.", "NTA. When family comes at you for not helping Chris ask them why they didn\u2019t help you when your parents wouldn\u2019t give you anything for your college expenses. Ask them why they didn\u2019t tell your parents to help you with college or offer help in their stead? Now while you\u2019re not the AH neither is Chris.

You\u2019re not obligated to help him but you shouldn\u2019t treat him as if he\u2019s at fault for your parents\u2019 misbehavior, but as another commenter pointed out, you could agree to serve as a local resource/emergency contact for him.", "NTA but either is Chris.\n\nYou are not obliged to take him in, if you did rent a room it should be at whatever is fair in the area. \n\nit's great when people decide to give a child in need a home, but that can't mean they ignore their other kids as a result.  \n\nYou don't owe your folks anything, you've made a life without them.  The fact they see you 2x a year but don't know you're married also means they've never bothered asking and haven't made an effort to get to know your partner.  The thing with Chris - no he's not 'your brother' but he's just as innocent in this as you are ie he's a kid with parents who made plans that suited THEM just like they did with you - for You it was 'you're on your own we don't have money' for Chris it's 'We don't have much money live with your 'brother'  Also it's likely he doesn't know what happened with you and your parents.  He's only gotten their side of it and he may genuinely consider you his 'big brother', no that doesn't mean you have to reciprocate but it may just lend some empathy to him. \n\nYour feelings are valid but even if you don't want Chris living with you perhaps at some point you& spouse could be the adults he knows in the City ie somebody to have lunch with to tell him where to go/not go around town, and call incase of emergency.  He might be a decent young man that you & partner could have a relationship independently from your parents,  NOT as a 'brother' but as a young friend.", "NTA I've lived that college experience when you're justifying to the pence every single thing you buy and I understand where you're coming from. \n\nEither they saved for college for you and then reallocated that money to support their new son, or they didn't save and sprung that on you  at 17. Either way isn't great.\n\nThat they're expecting you to help them give their son a better college experience is completely tone deaf on their part.

When I first moved out at 19 I got an apartment with my long time boyfriend, we both worked full time, both were pretty responsible and mature, and even though my parent knew we were well set up and likely to be just fine, they still checked in once a month or so just to be sure. This from a single mom who had my little sister and couldn\u2019t afford to help me with college and stuff either, she still made sure I knew I could go to her in emergencies.

Again, they have to have some basic knowledge that housing in a city is expensive.  Most parents are there when their kids go to college.

Oh, you are in an apartment?\"  So they HAVE to know that he is paying what is likely to be a very high rent.  Still, they ask no further questions about how he is affording this.\n\nIt just doesn't add up.  The parents had to be WILLFULLY blind to not realize the financial strain OP was under.  It's one thing if OP was posting \"I was robbed and never told my parents, so they did not realize I was broke.\"  But they live in a country that limits the hours a student can work, they know he has no financial aid, they know he is paying expensive rent in a city all on his own.  There is a part of them that KNOWS he must be hanging on by a thread.  Which is *why* they specifically told him - don't come to us, we have another child to support now.

I'm actually really proud of him that he has realised that we know he loves us all equally and it's ok not to be so strict, but I'm 40 and he's 67 and he's just now getting to a point where he can consider that maybe it's ok to spend a few dollars different and it doesn't mean you love one more or less.  My mother is certainly pleased, because when we were kids it was within 5c.  That is the biggest difference he would allow.  All christmas presents and birthday presents.   It was hell for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI won't tell you that you are wrong, because I have seen the impact that level of special of one child over another can have on someone and how it is life long. He still remembers and even though he loved his parents and he loves his siblings, it still has impact.  Our Christmas presents weren't within a $1 this year, but they decided to help my brothers buy houses.  I own a house.  They decided to help my brothers because they helped me with my deposit, and they always said they'd help them once they retire.  Which they're doing.  Property market has changed.  My house has doubled in 5 years.  So they have to give more to help my brothers.  As far as I'm concerned that is a need for them, it's not a want so different rules.  Dad still had to give me the same amount, no matter how many times I said that it isn't necessary.  He topped up what he gave me.  I tried to stop him, but he shut me down every time, to the point I realised I have to let him do this.    At 68, he still worries about his 40 year old daughter who knows he would die for her, will feel unloved if he didn't keep it equal.\n\nSo NTA.
