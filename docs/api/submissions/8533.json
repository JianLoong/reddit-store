My parents told me they could not financially help me because they have another child now. I admit, I resented that. I had to work and go to college. For the first two years I couldn't get into university dorms so I had to rent, which was much more expensive. I can't count how many times I hadn't eaten for 2-3 days.

In the middle of dinner my parents told me that Chris is going to university in the same city I live and if he could stay with me. They would pay for rent and expenses. Now, I live in the townhouse in the middle of all faculties. I'm in prime spot. I don't rent rooms, but if I would, rent would be highest in the city. I was triggered when my parents said they would pay for him, so I said that they can't afford to rent a room in my place and to look elsewhere. All family there were shocked by my response, and my parents were somewhat taken aback.\n\nSince then a couple of family members told me I'm an AH for not helping my family. My parents texted me to reconsider and help my brother and that he is very upset his big brother wont help him. I told them he is their son, but he is not my brother and I have no obligation towards him. Even Chris texted me and begged me to reconsider but I just ignore him.

You were basically abandoned and you managed to get yourself through school.  You didn't specify but I am assuming that you are in the US and that their income made you ineligible for financial aid despite the fact that they declined to provide that \"anticipated family contribution\".\n\nThey should not expect you to have a sibling bond with Chris (who I do feel bad for-none of this is his fault and who knows what they've told him to explain your absence from his life without owning up to their own failings ) and it was an outrageously manipulative move to make their proposal about Chris living with you at a holiday meal, with an audience.  Putting you on the spot like that was vile, even without the slap in the face about their helping Chris with college in ways they would not help you. \n\nEven if you were crazy about Chris and had a good relationship with your folks,  you still wouldn't be obligated to take a teenager into your home. That's a lot to ask under the best of circumstances and under the circumstances you're describing,  it is unthinkable.\n\nYou may want to tell them the real reason and explain that you didn't want to air that laundry at the table.

Hold your ground", "In the first place, you would have no obligation to rent him a room even if you *did* consider him to be your brother. Living with someone is a big deal, whether they are family or not. There are many, many ways for roommate situations to go horribly badly, even when all the people involved are basically good people. When one is a teenager just starting college, and the other is a married adult who has been forced to support himself for a decade, that is not likely to be a good roommate match.\n\nBut you don't consider him to be your brother, and that is largely due to the choices that your parents made. I know a couple who adopted four young children (long story--it started out as one, then a second 2 years later, then things happened and it became four overnight) while their biological daughter was in college. But the couple made sure that their older daughter knew that she was valued and loved. They continue to help support her while she was in college (despite the fact that they hadn't planned on having the expense of *four* more kids) and she still came home for holidays/lived at home for the first year post-college until she found a place of her own. And while she obviously doesn't have the same sibling bond with the young ones that they have with each other, she's almost like a beloved aunt to them. And that's because the couple never acted like her needs were any less important than the other children.\n\nNTA. Not because they *asked* about Chris living with you (that would have been N. A. H.) but because they are refusing to accept your \"no\" as an answer.\n\nAnyone who is still giving you a hard time should be told in no uncertain terms, \"My parents didn't care that I went hungry when I was Chris's age, and they didn't even know that I was married.

Especially if your parents can\u2019t Even acknowledge the double standard and extreme hardship you had to go through that they could have helped alleviate. \n\nIt sounds like you barely have a relationship so you\u2019d be essentially housing a stranger (and an 18YO one at that who will likely want to go out, have friends over, and generally engage in college activities that you might not want in your home.", "NTA. It\u2019s admirable that your parents adopted a seven year old, but they had a 17 year commitment to you and they neglected you. Sure you were an adult, but if I thought my 18 year old was going hungry I\u2019d move heaven and earth to help them. You\u2019re right, you don\u2019t owe your parents or their child anything.

I think your partner needs to understand how this situation would be pretty bad for your mental health and could feed the resentment even more. Having a constant reminder of how your parents didn't support you but are paying rent for their other kid would suck really bad especially since they haven't really tried to mend the relationship with you in all those years.", "NTA. When family comes at you for not helping Chris ask them why they didn\u2019t help you when your parents wouldn\u2019t give you anything for your college expenses. Ask them why they didn\u2019t tell your parents to help you with college or offer help in their stead? Now while you\u2019re not the AH neither is Chris.

You\u2019re not obligated to help him but you shouldn\u2019t treat him as if he\u2019s at fault for your parents\u2019 misbehavior, but as another commenter pointed out, you could agree to serve as a local resource/emergency contact for him.", "NTA but either is Chris.\n\nYou are not obliged to take him in, if you did rent a room it should be at whatever is fair in the area. \n\nit's great when people decide to give a child in need a home, but that can't mean they ignore their other kids as a result.  \n\nYou don't owe your folks anything, you've made a life without them.  The fact they see you 2x a year but don't know you're married also means they've never bothered asking and haven't made an effort to get to know your partner.  The thing with Chris - no he's not 'your brother' but he's just as innocent in this as you are ie he's a kid with parents who made plans that suited THEM just like they did with you - for You it was 'you're on your own we don't have money' for Chris it's 'We don't have much money live with your 'brother'  Also it's likely he doesn't know what happened with you and your parents.  He's only gotten their side of it and he may genuinely consider you his 'big brother', no that doesn't mean you have to reciprocate but it may just lend some empathy to him. \n\nYour feelings are valid but even if you don't want Chris living with you perhaps at some point you& spouse could be the adults he knows in the City ie somebody to have lunch with to tell him where to go/not go around town, and call incase of emergency.  He might be a decent young man that you & partner could have a relationship independently from your parents,  NOT as a 'brother' but as a young friend.", "NTA I've lived that college experience when you're justifying to the pence every single thing you buy and I understand where you're coming from. \n\nEither they saved for college for you and then reallocated that money to support their new son, or they didn't save and sprung that on you  at 17. Either way isn't great.\n\nThat they're expecting you to help them give their son a better college experience is completely tone deaf on their part.

This is a loaded situation sitting atop a brew of resentment and struggle, and it's definitely a bit MUCH for them to just announce that you should do this very big thing when they will foot the bill... after making you literally starve to work your way through college.  You have justification for not helping with this, and your feelings are valid.\n\nThis is a situation that is not going to improve if you don't sit down and have it out with your parents and tell them how you felt all this time.

Now all of a sudden you would like me to take in Chris after years of us barely having a relationship. You also say you will pay for it, which is hurtful to me as you did not help me at all. I have nothing against Chris as he is an innocent party in this situation, but him being negatively impacted is not because of my wrongdoings, but yours.

To that end you also do not need to take in their other son (though please recognize none of this is his fault, he didn\u2019t come in at 7 and demand they use their resources for him. your parents chose that) because your home is not their home.
