He is one creepy dude.", "OP: I see your edit.\n\n***HE CAN NOT DELETE THE PICTURES.***\n\nSure, he's removed them from his phone. *But he has already sent them to someone else.* That person could, in theory, delete them forever as well. Or they could send them to everyone in their contacts. Or put them online. Or email them to every teacher in your school.\n\nMy sister and I take unflattering photos of each other. We send them to each other like \"lol potato face\" or whatever. But we delete them and NEVER send them to anyone else.\n\nI hope this mutual friend of yours also deletes the photos. Have you taken care of that?\n\n**NTA for being upset. But I think you're a little naive.** Yes, it's just a buttcrack. It's not like it's porn or anything. But his behaviour is unacceptable and you should NOT send images like that to other people with consent.", "NTA. The fact that he didn't even respect the fact you were uncomfortable is kinda weird. \n\nLike sure, maybe he was just joking and didn't mean anything by it, but there's no way he dismissed you like that. Just because he would be fine with it doesn't mean you would be. \n\nYou getting upset was valid, but i'm glad he said he wasn't going to do it again, but if he actually does, I don't think you should stay friends with someone who makes you feel the way you did.", "NTA. His \"comedy\" simply not funny at all.", "NTA in the Uk this is illegal and he could be charged. Also, obvious but that ain\u2019t no friend. Kick him to the curb immediately", "Stop showing your butt crack to people, creepy weirdo.", "I think it's a Soft ESH.\n\nTaking a compromising picture and then sending it to a third party is not cool. You don't know how it can turn out in the long run since we live in crappy world.\n\nOP overreacted just a tiny bit since they themselves admit to being aware that it wasn't done for any malicious intent.

It\u2019s just a butcrack and in my family growing up if your crack was showing everyone would look and laugh and make plumber jokes so to me it\u2019s not a big deal but if it\u2019s a big deal to you, your feelings are valid to be upset however whoever said anything about pressing charges is ridiculous. Gonna ruin this guys entire life over a buttcrack\u2026. I dunno. Obviously do whatever YOU want to do, this is simply just my opinion.", "ESH. Cover your butt crack, and also don't take pictures of people's butt cracks. These two things can and should co-exist.", "NTA.\nStick up a rod inside his dumb ass for \"comedy\". This is absolutely disgusting and it's way past boundaries. We really do not care how he does this to other friends they're not you OP. I would feel unsafe around this type of person if I were you.", "NTA, but if it makes you feel any better, my brother and his friends genuinely do send unfunny pictures like that back and forth with each other (not of girl\u2019s cracks but yk). it\u2019s crass but yeah\u2026. they\u2019re stupid and find that stuff funny", "NTA. Your friend is terrible. He's sending pictures he took of you without your consent to other people? Does he not realize that these people could send those pictures to some serious creeps? This isn't funny. I don't care that this \"friend\" is only attracted to men and did it for \"comedy\" he's an asshole. He sent those pictures off and some jackass could've sold them on an explicit site by now.

It\u2019s good that he apologized and said that he would never do it again, but you of course did not overreact.\n\nHe brought up how he would feel if you did that, but he\u2019s the one showing a lack of empathy by not understanding how violating your trust would be an issue for someone. \n\nYou were in his room, your pants slipped a bit, and he took a picture of your exposed body for amusement. It\u2019s messed up.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make him some awful person or anything, but he should work to understand how this is a violation of trust and why using someone\u2019s vulnerability to gratify themselves and others is unacceptable.\n\nAgain, **NTA**.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nSending and taking embarrassing pictures of anyone is a dick move. Literally the only reason he sent it was to laugh at you with the mutual friend.\n\nI get that this is semi-common in male friend groups, theyll rag on the others for fun, but unless you have agreed to that dynamic its not okay.\n\nSexual orientation doesnt matter here as its clearly not done to be a perv, its an obvious joke. Still though that doesnt make it acceptable and its still very rude to laugh at you.", "NTA. It\u2019s creepy even if he\u2019s not into women- I\u2019m tired of \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d being a get out of jail free card for dudes to ignore basic consent.", "NTA.Thats weird and not even funny unless this guy is like 13 yrs old", "NTA He should have dropped a pencil into it like normal people do. Taking a picture is going too far.", "NTA. His sexual orientation is irrelevant. The violation of sexual boundaries isn\u2019t about sex, it\u2019s about power, control, and coercion. Otherwise, rapists would just visit hookers and voyeurs would just look at porn. It\u2019s the violation of personal boundaries that\u2019s the point. \n\nYour feelings are entirely valid. What makes this worse is that he sent the photo to someone else. That means the photo forever exists - who cares if he deleted it on his phone? Is it gone from his Google photos / iCloud account? What about his friend\u2019s phone/ cloud storage? How do you know his friend didn\u2019t circulate it in turn? \n\nDump this friend - him saying you \u201coverreacted\u201d is him failing to take responsibility and be appropriately contrite.", "NTA consent matters!

'Okay, I'm sorry, but I still think you're overreacting' isn't a good apology.", "NTA.   \nWhat is overreact? Literally I would be fuming if someone uses me as a joke to them and not only that sent the pic out for multiple others to see? His definition of joke is humiliating other people. And that is wrong.", "I think he has learnt a valuable lesson from this.", "NTA. How old is he? That's totally inappropriate at any age. Taking a picture of more intimate parts without consent. Sharing it with a friend.  Saying oh I do it all the time and it's a joke. All inappropriate.  He is clearly someone who neither understands or respects boundaries.  Or the law. He is a creep.", "NTA. In fact, I\u2019d look into pressing charging", "NTA.\n\nINFO: WHAT IS THE \u201cJOKE?\u201d Be specific. What is the \u201cjoke?\u201d  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s gay. That is fucking pervy and creepy and he completely dismissed and disrespected you and your bodily autonomy and privacy.  \n\nYou need to find a new friend. This person is NOT your friend.", "NTA\n \nIt\u2019s only a funny joke when everyone is laughing. Very distasteful. Don\u2019t feel bad about not waiting an embarrassing picture on the web or any devices other that yours. How can you even send someone such a photo of your friends? That\u2019s a tiny bit cruel. \n\nYou need to take a closer look at that friend and see if there are any other micro behaviors that communicate lack of respect. \n\nI had a friend like that who would take embarrassing pics of me and then whenever I\u2019d date someone she\u2019d ask the guys if they wanted to see the photos of me not looking the greatest. \nNeedless to say, I told that friend to fuck off very soon once I connected the dots.", "100% invasion of privacy, it\u2019s like people taking photos of plumbers showing crack, it\u2019s purely to mock you, which is pretty trash in itself.
