Will try to be as objective as possible about what just occurred: \n\nHusband and I got into the stupidest argument 5 mins ago about Halloween candy. I asked him to not open any new bags and first go through what is already opened, because every year our dentist\u2019s office does a Halloween candy drive to donate unopened bags of candy. As I finished speaking to him, he doesn\u2019t break eye contact with me and proceeds to open a brand new bag of candy. Perhaps it\u2019s my raging pregnancy hormones, but I literally just blurted out \u201cWhy the fuck would you do that when I literally just finished asking you to please not?!\u201d He immediately gets angry with me for cursing at him, to which I paused, admitted it was wrong, and apologized by saying that I should not have expressed my anger in that way and he didn\u2019t deserve to be spoken to like that, however feeling angry about what he did was a valid emotion and the anger and my reaction could be mutually exclusive. He did not accept my apology because he felt I was justifying my behavior. I told him I was not justifying cursing, I was explaining where the anger came from (he admits no fault).\n\nHe proceeds to give me an ultimatum saying I either apologize and drop the conversation entirely or the night will be ruined. When I say that I have already genuinely apologized and that the ultimatum is unfair, he tells me that that\u2019s the choice I\u2019m making and that I have effectively ruined the evening. He goes to take a shower and on the way into the bedroom starts barking orders to me: \u201cFeed the dog. Don\u2019t talk to me.\u201d I follow him into the bedroom to try to talk to him and he tells me that me not giving him space is what abusers do to their victims. All of this because of stupid Halloween candy (which I know, I guess I \u201cstarted\u201d the argument by freaking out in the first place). AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: Husband got out of shower and apologized for his behavior. He said he was self-admittedly on autopilot when I was speaking to him and absentmindedly opened the bag, then got flustered when I freaked at him and his gut instinct is to defend/ himself/look for ways he isn\u2019t in the wrong. It ended up being a quick and productive conversation. For everyone mentioning that my husband may be abusive, I appreciate your concern\u2026I don\u2019t think one AITA post explains the nuances of an entire relationship between 2 people. I think the fact that he cooled off and came to his senses shows that he is working on himself, too.

Only 2 are unopened. The others are either halfway or completely full. The bag he opened was Twix.

You go girl!", "These are all good points and of course questions I didn\u2019t immediately consider about what might be going through his head as he is staring at me opening the bag anyways.
