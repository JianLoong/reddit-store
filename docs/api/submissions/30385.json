{"id": 30385, "submission_id": "17omdfy", "title": "AITAH for refusing to go with husband when I wasn\u2019t invited?", "selftext": "I (29) got a text from sister-in-law asking if she and my husbands brother could steal my husband (34) for a day. I said it was fine but wondered what they were going to do. She responds saying that they\u2019re going to an amusement park and she\u2019s taking her sister and doesn\u2019t want her husband to feel left out so they want to take mine. I felt hurt they invited him but didn\u2019t even bother asking if I wanted to come along even if it did make it uneven again. I didn\u2019t respond with any of that but said that it was fine. Few days pass and my husband comes to me asking about if I knew about them wanting him to go with them and if I said I didn\u2019t want to go. I told him no that wasn\u2019t it, I wasn\u2019t invited. They only wanted you to go. I told him what was said in the text and I understand they wanted him to go to keep his brother company since her sister was going too. He said they had passes where you could bring a friend each. So if I did go we would have to pay for me, however they didn\u2019t invite me so I told him I wasn\u2019t going to go if I wasn\u2019t wanted. It\u2019s rude to invite one and not the other in my opinion when it involves married couples. My husband says they probably didn\u2019t mean it in that way and that I\u2019m being petty. That if I want to go then I should just come with them. I asked my best friend and another if they would have been upset and they both said they would be totally pissed but is my husband right? Am I being petty?

We don't know if they want to invite you or if there's an implied invite anywhere or not, because it wasn't communicated. Simple as that. There's no question of you being petty. If your husband wants a clarification, he's free to ask them for one.", "NTA. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t think SIL meant anything bad by it (\u201chey let\u2019s go to an amusement park with our siblings!\u201d), I think she\u2019s not thinking with her whole brain. By saying \u201ccan we steal your husband for a day\u201d, that is explicitly saying \u201ctake your husband away from you\u201d or \u201cyou are not invited\u201d. I doubt it\u2019s malicious, but it is absent minded, and that makes her a slight AH. \n\nThat being said, if my s/o was invited somewhere without me, but didn\u2019t want to go without me (like seems the case here), I\u2019d tell them \u201ctalk to them first and make sure they\u2019re okay with me coming.\u201d That might impact HIS willingness to go if they aren\u2019t cool with it. If they\u2019re neural about you coming, and he wants you there, you\u2019re not going anywhere you\u2019re not wanted, and at least one person really wants you there.", "NTA\n\nYou were not invited which was rude.  Your husband cannot put lipstick on this pig.", "Of course you shouldn\u2019t go. Your husband was invited to hang out with his brother. A bit weird that they have to be \u2018even\u2019 as grown adults, but I personally wouldn\u2019t be the person who had to tag along with my husband on everything he does.", "What is going on here? I don't see it as a big deal if woman wants to invite her brother to a day out. What I don't get is why go to the OP? What's that about.  You talk to the person you want to invite,  not thier wife.  Who operates this way? \n\nNow the polite thing to do would be to explain they only had 2 spare tickets so if OP wanted to come her ticket needs to be paid for. Then it's up to OP and husband if they want to do that.  \n\nI think OP has a right to be a bit annoyed but it's not that bad.", "NTA. \u201cCan we steal your husband for a day?\u201d implies steal him *from* you, not *along with* you.\n\nIf he wants to clarify with them, he should do so, not put it on you.", "NAH:  Don't go if you don't want.  But sounds like they both could bring one additional person for free.  Your sister in law chose her sister and your brother in law chose your husband.  You don't have to take it so personal as if they purposely excluding you. \n\nAlso that is nonsense to say that people can't invite one half of a couple out.  Are you saying every time you spend time with friends they invite you husband because I doubt that", "NTA Why would your sister in law text you instead of your husband with an invitation for your husband? Is she socially inept?", "Edit.\nIm going to clarify because apparently it\u2019s not clear in the original post I guess. My SIL is inviting her sister because she is coming to visit her and wanted my husband to come to keep his brother company so she could spend time with her sister and not have to worry about him feeling left out while she\u2019s spending time. Not a date or set up of any kind. I love my husband and he definitely loves me so there\u2019s no question about that. On the matter of thinking that if one is invited and not the other\u2026on big things like amusement parks or something I would want to make sure that the other is invited. If it\u2019s just to hang out with friends doing our own thing wouldn\u2019t bother me so much. I don\u2019t even mind that they want to have a siblings day However they should have just asked him, I love amusement parks and asking me felt like it was being rubbed in my face that I\u2019m not being invited. So I\u2019ll let them have they\u2019re sibling day and just find something to do. Thanks everyone for feedback", "NAH. You shouldn't go because you weren't invited, and it's nice that he can spend some time with his brother while she spends time with her sister. I don't see anything weird about it. I'm sure they invite you to other things. Let the siblings have their day.", "NAH you\u2019re not an AH for refusing to go because you\u2019re correct, you were not invited. But I also don\u2019t think your sister in law is in the wrong. \n\nLooking at this objectively, a couple got two free tickets to an amusement park and they both decided to invite their siblings. It\u2019s not like this is a friend excluding you out of spite or you\u2019re the only family member not invited, they only got one free ticket each and they chose their brother and sister (a very harmless choice). \n\nHonestly though I don\u2019t get why she texted you at all, her husband should have just messaged his brother directly but maybe she thought she was being polite.", "NTA and your husband is clueless. \n\nYou weren't invited. She asked for permission to take him. No mention of you going at all. They didn't want you there.", "NTA.  It was clear that the invite was only for your husband so that he could keep his brother company.", "At first I thought NTA, but then I realized it\u2019s two brothers and two sisters going. Meh. NAH", "NAH\n\nSister is having a day with her sister. Brothers are having a day with each other. I think your looking into it to much but also your not self inviting which is a plus.\n\nGo call a friend and do some times with them while your husband is out. Me I would go fishing if the partner was gone for the day.", "Wow I just have to add that there are an unusual number of people who think they are setting the brother up on a date.  Are you guys unhinged or do you just read too much Reddit.  I mean seriously do none of you hang out with your siblings.  Is she required to now bring her husband to every event she has with girlfriends?  Get a grip it was a sibling\u2019s get together.  They grew up together what is wrong with having time together occasionally as adults just a sibling group.  Sheesh.", "This going to look like two couples to people around them. They don't the actual relationships in the group. Are you all right with that? NTA. I find this strange.", "NTA but they did ask you for permission to have him for a day so that doesn't seem an unfriendly thing to do.  I can understand why you feel left out.  I hope you do something fun for yourself while he's away.  It's healthy to do things separately from time to time.", "Nta, however I don't think there's anything wrong with inviting one partner and not the other. People have different relationships with people.  Outside of work, people should spend time with people they like or choose too, not people they're forced to be with due  to some forced expectations.   I do not like all of my husband's family and friends, and vice versa. I would be peeved if it was required that we  had to participate in forced interactions  due to us being a package deal.  We're a couple with individual wants and needs.", "I guess I must be confused? They asked her if she would mind, explained the situation, and she said fine. Sisters and brothers out for a day?", "If people want you to be there, they invite you. How often does this happen?", "So why didn\u2019t sis in law just call her brother directly and ask him to go along? \nIf they had only 1 pass then that could have been communicated and the couple could have decided if they wanted to pay for one ticket.  Calling to ask to borrow the husband for a day before asking him if he even wanted to go is what makes it feel off.", "They specifically asked if you would be upset if they stole your husband for the day. How is your husband twisting this to make it so that *you* have somehow misunderstood the situation?", "NAH, closer to YTA because I feel like you're making this a way bigger deal than necessary.\n\nSil wants to hang out with her sister but doesn't want her husband to feel like a third wheel, so she figured why not make it a siblings thing and get his brother on board. Inviting you does kind of screw up that intent because your husband wouldn't want you to be the odd one out, so her husband would again be the third wheel.\n\nPlus, like you mentioned, asking you both to go means asking you to buy your own ticket. I'd personally feel weird being like \"oh yeah you can come too but you're the only one not paid for sorry\"\n\nShe asked *you* for permission to make sure that was fine. You said it was even though it clearly bothers you. \n\nIf you don't want to go because you weren't part of the initial plans, fine. But your husband wasn't either. Why not go and use your friend pass to bring one of the friends you asked? You could all eat and hang out together, but be paired off with someone so nobody is the odd one out. \n\nIf you're refusing to go because you weren't initially invited and you're offended, that is petty. You could have very well have asked if you could come. Like I said, bring a friend and have a good time. There's no reason to be quietly pissed at your SIL and sulk about the house instead of going out just because you wanted to be part of the first invitation.", "Going against the grain but soft YTA.  It\u2019s a good thing for siblings to spend time together.  One of my best memories was going to an amusement park with just me and my brother.  We just got to hang out and talk and eat things our parents wouldn\u2019t let us when we were kids.  And you don\u2019t need to do EVERYTHING with your husband.  Let him have some fun with family without you and stop taking it personally", "NTA. \u201cStealing\u201d your husband means (playfully) stealing him from you. If they don\u2019t know the term, that\u2019s on them. You weren\u2019t invited.", "I mean yeah they very specifically asked to steal your husband for a day which means you are not invited", "NTA show your husband this post, his sister knew what she was doing. What she did was incredibly rude.", "It\u2019s unhinged how many people assume this is a double date. Good lord, do none of you have siblings?", "Why didn't they text your husband directly? Sounds like he knew they were going to text you. Your not being petty. They are rude.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t have him go without me. Sounds like she\u2019s trying to set up a double date with her sister and your husband. Rude AF to not just invite a single man.", "I find it odd that SIL didn\u2019t want her husband to feel left out but didn\u2019t mind making you feel left out\u2026", "Is her husband 5? Can he not ride by himself? Can she not go to the park with just her sister?", "NTA if you have the money & it\u2019s got really fun rides, get a fast pass (if they aren\u2019t getting one), then go by yourself. Wave to them as they wait for hours in line while you breeze through fast pass as a single rider.", "NTA. Not only were you not invited but they either outright said or implied that you declined an invite. That's completely different than just not inviting you.", "ESH. It\u2019s definitely not rude to invite one married person to things. My wife and I mostly socialize separately. You can take a break every once in a while. \n\nAnd her asking you first was your chance to say no! You skipped it.\n\nBut also, your husband is super wrong to try to bring you anyway. No invite, not going.", "NTA. I\u2019m completely on the side of it\u2019s good for married couples to do things occasionally without their spouse. I think you\u2019re right for not going, you literally weren\u2019t invited. But I think it is extremely weird (and borderline rude) that your SIL reached out to you about inviting your husband, when you weren\u2019t invited. She should\u2019ve reached out to your husband and explained that they wanted to invite him because they had an extra pass and his brother wanted to invite him to make it even. It\u2019s your husband\u2019s responsibility to make sure there are no family plans that day and discuss it with you. I think this would\u2019ve avoided a lot of the feelings of being hurt and feeling left out.", "NTA\n\nThey asked to \u201csteal\u201d your husband. That\u2019s implicitly telling you they don\u2019t want you there. That they are ONLY inviting him. I don\u2019t go places I\u2019m not invited. Not being invited means you\u2019re not wanted. I don\u2019t see how that could have been communicated anymore clearly outside of just saying it directly.", "NTA, super weird to do that. And \u201cimplied invitations\u201d leave room for awkwardness if it turns out you weren\u2019t invited. AND, why the hell would they need to \u201ceven it out\u201d into pairs I just don\u2019t get that", "NTA - you are correct. Why are they asking you to borrow him anyways? It's like they excluded you on purpose. Why would they not ask him, and then he asks you? Because it was clear you weren't being invited.\n\nYour husband needs to realise you aren't the initiator here and you dgaf about the fair, what was being communicated to you is that they asked specifically for him.", "NTA they should have invited an unmarried friend of your BIL if it was to make the party an even number. Not the married brother. they could have invited you both on a different occasion. they were in the wrong for this awkward situation", "It seems all of it came from a lack of communication.  \nBasically your SIL could have been upfront about the freepass from the start and you could have asked directly if you could go to (*which would have reveal the freepass part*).\n\nStill i'll stick to NTA, but i believe it could have been avoided.", "Well they specifically said they were asking you if they could steal your husband for a day.  So they acknowledge they were not inviting you.  And were up front about it and honest with you.  If this is a habit of theirs, then they are AH and you have a right to be petty.  But if this sort of thing is a one-off or rare, then you would be in the wrong to get too upset.  Married couples are not joined at the hip and they can occasionally do things separate from one another.  Especially in this case as the goal appears to be to keep the numbers even.", "YTA\n\nJust because you are married doesn\u2019t mean you have to do everything together. Jeesh, you are not Siamees twins.\n\nSomebody said others would see two couples. Who gives a flying fuck what others think in an amusement park? \nAlso, as you stated, you being there would make it uneven. Being 2x2 means that there will be interaction between these two groups, having 3x2 most definitely will have a very different dynamic, the party of 3 will flock together with very limited interaction.\nJust don\u2019t be so butthurt, nobody excluded maliciously. \n\nTo be honest, your complaint sounds more like jealousy on your part to me. Let your husband enjoy this day, and make sure that you enjoy this day as well. Go to a Spa, go to the movies, do something you always wanted to do but had no time.", "YTA\n\nYour SiL had a open free pass and wanted to offer it to her husband's brother so they could hang out together.\n\nNow something that wasn't about you is all about you.", "Ok, SIL lied to OP\u2019s husband by saying OP has said she doesn\u2019t want to go. \n\nSIL LIED.  Obviously doesn\u2019t want OP to go.", "NTA for being upset about it but if you want to go and your husband clearly a) wants you to come and b) is happy to pay for your ticket then you're cutting off your nose to spite your face by not going and being an AH to yourself.", "YTA You\u2019re being way too sensitive.  They want to use the free pass for your husband but there is no reason to think they wouldn\u2019t be happy top have you join so long as they don\u2019t have to pay for you.  If you want to go, go, and pay your entry fee.", "NTA.  By SIL's text it is very clear they were not inviting you.  But, did SIL & BIL give your husband the impression that you said you didn't want to go?  If they did, that shows that they know it is rude to invite your husband and not you and they are trying to cover their butts. Does BIL not have any unattached friends they could invite?", "NTA.  You clearly were not invited.", "NTA. And for those folks saying \u2018it\u2019ll look like a date\u2019 I say \u2018it *is* a date, SIL is setting her sister up with your husband on a date.\u2019", "NAH", "I dont know this is just an awkard situation and i would be super uncomfortable/hurt about it. I cant imagine inviting my husbands brother with me, my husband and my \"single bestfriend\" anywhere. It would put them both in almost a blind date situation. It sounds catty to me... I cant imagine not thinking this through. She sounds like a jerk. As others have said I think the best thing to do if your husband does want to go and wants you to go, is to have him text his brother about it.", "ESH. This is the most childish dynamic ever. SIL should have explained about the passes in the first place. If OP wants to go to the amusement park with her husband, she should. You\u2019re an adult; life is too short to cling to petty resentments.", "nta", "NTA and your husband sounds clueless af. the way she worded it was clealrly meant that you're not invited but your husband is. tagging along would be rude.\n\nyou're not being petty. \n\nand honestly, the whole invitation thing sounded just weird. why is she contacting you about this? why didn't your husband's brother talk to your husband about it?", "NTA they explicitly stated they wanted him to be away from you and with them instead. You are explicitly not invited.\n\nI don't think there is anything wrong with him asking them if he can bring you, then making his decision based on their answer. I don't even think it is wrong if he decides to go with them without you when they tell him that they only want him. But, I do think something is wrong with your husband telling you that you are petty.", "NTA. The wording of the texts and texting you about it at all is really strange. Your husband should have been invited, and then he should have told you about it. The only way this comes off to me is your sister-in-law either being so thoughtless that she doesn't realize what she's implying, or she's rubbing it in your face that you're not invited.", "So let\u2019s get this straight sister in law is inviting husband only on an outing with her sister and husbands brother. Are we sure sister in law isn\u2019t trying to get them 2 together.. \n\nI would be going with my husband and not let sister near him.. you know he will end up having to ride all the rides etc with sister because sister-in-law will have to ride with her husband.. \n\nDon\u2019t let her getaway with it.. husband said come so stake your claim and go.. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n\nSIL explicitly asked to take husband from you for the day. That is stating directly \u201cwhatever we\u2019re doing, you\u2019re not invited\u201d.

I would never allow someone to treat my husband like that and I know my husband wouldn\u2019t let me get treated like that.   You got a SO Problem.

Sitting back and playing victim is childish and immature.", "NTA, but GO!!\n\nDon't let them set a precedent that your husband goes and some other woman is going with the sister in law...  It has the appearance of being a set-up,  like two couples and THAT'S NOT OKAY for you to not be invited when another woman is being invited.  Why are you being left out?  That's just not cool.

They intentionally didn't invite you, pass or no pass, and that's rude.", "No they deliberately excluded you, but it probably wasn't malicious. If you want to go to an amusement park, plan a day with your husband and go to an amusement park. They probably didn't even realize how big their error was. and no you're not being petty I would be upset too. Don't think they were trying to hurt you but it is incredibly rude to only ask one person from a married couple or any long-term committed couple for that matter. Completely bad form but some people just have no etiquette. NTA.", "She's invited her sister, he's invited his brother? Is that how it's supposed to balance? Whatever their logic it's not explained well and I would be a bit miffed too", "NTA - in this situation it is ok for your feelings to be hurt and it sounds like you tried to avoid causing drama. \n\nMy husband recently got invited to a brunch party with a former classmate, and I would say friend, and her husband who he\u2019s not super close to but they both like each other. I did not get invited. That\u2019s less \u201cextreme\u201d than this situation but my feelings were a little hurt. I told him he can go if he wants to - he keeps insisting they probably meant the invite for both of us but I\u2019m fairly sure they did not for some other reasons. \n\nIt is ok to feel bad about this; usually if it is relatives or people you know, you would assume in most cases that they would invite you too. I think you handled this maturely but it\u2019s also ok to be bummed out.", "I don't understand why so many people in the comments can't understand the intention of her sister in law.  \n\nThey have 3 people going, her sister in law is taking her sister and her sisters husband.  depending on how close they are, it's very common for someone to feel like a third wheel.  Since I don't know them, I'll trust the implication that her and her sister are so close that the husband might feel left out.  Especially since most rides have two people sitting together.  \n\nTaking one extra person is entirely normal in these situations.  Also inviting one person in a married couple is not rude at all in this scenario.  \n\nSince when is it implied that married couples don't have their own lives to do what they want.

Go do something with your own family or friends.", "Esh,  it\u2019s an amusement park,  he\u2019s invited to specifically keep her husband company,  kinda rude of her,  but I think you should not get so worked up if this isn\u2019t a pattern", "NAH - I feel like this is a situation that could be resolved with a simple conversation. If you want to go too, you could easily ask \"am I invited too?\" or \"is it okay if I come as well\". Then you'll have a clear answer and won't have to guess what they want.", "Seems very outdated to need to have a balance of genders in the group... why can't everyone just go and hang out together?

Also I don\u2019t think I would feel particularly comfortable with SIL basically setting him up on a date with her sister. Why else couldn\u2019t they find someone else?

She responds saying that they\u2019re going to an amusement park and she\u2019s taking her sister and doesn\u2019t want her husband to feel left out so they want to take mine. I felt hurt they invited him but didn\u2019t even bother asking if I wanted to come along even if it did make it uneven again. I didn\u2019t respond with any of that but said that it was fine. Few days pass and my husband comes to me asking about if I knew about them wanting him to go with them and if I said I didn\u2019t want to go. I told him no that wasn\u2019t it, I wasn\u2019t invited. They only wanted you to go. I told him what was said in the text and I understand they wanted him to go to keep his brother company since her sister was going too. He said they had passes where you could bring a friend each. So if I did go we would have to pay for me, however they didn\u2019t invite me so I told him I wasn\u2019t going to go if I wasn\u2019t wanted. It\u2019s rude to invite one and not the other in my opinion when it involves married couples. My husband says they probably didn\u2019t mean it in that way and that I\u2019m being petty. That if I want to go then I should just come with them. I asked my best friend and another if they would have been upset and they both said they would be totally pissed but is my husband right? Am I being petty? Am I the ahole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA, but it is strange that they didn't invite you, even if they did only have 4 tickets. You could have also dropped a casual, 'Can I come as well?' Even though you shouldn't really need to do that - but that likely would've clarified the matter.\n\nYou're definitely not petty - your husband should have put himself in your shoes and realised that it was a bit odd.", "NTA.  You are not petty and your husband is wrong.  The6 meant it exactly as there said.  They stole him for the day.", "NTA. Your husband had to decline the invitation.", "NTA\n\nThis was weird. Husband is also not in his right to invite you without checking with them, so you're right to decline \n\nHonestly, if your husband doesn't want to go without you, he needs to tell them that and leave you out of it. SIL made it pretty clear in the breakdown the plans didn't involve you\n\nI have to imagine they both know a non married person who could have come to I'd they wanted pairs, so this is absolutely weird. Even worse if they want to ride together as a couple that it puts your husband with a random woman. None of this was thought out well, unless tge point was to put your husband with a random woman\n\nAlso, why were you even the intermediate for your husband hare, that was super weird to begin with. Talk to the man directly and let him decide", "They don\u2019t have an unmarried friend they could invite? Weird but NTA", "NTA, but I also don\u2019t think your SIL is one either. I don\u2019t mind if I\u2019m not invited to things my husband is. I love my SIL but if I want to hang out with my brother I don\u2019t need to always be with her and it goes both ways. I like doing things solo.", "NTA - If you're not invited, don't go. \nThat's something I take a firm stance on personally.", "NTA The way it was phrased excluded you. Rides generally need even numbers of passengers. Bringing you will cause the brother to have to ride alone and they are back where they started. I feel it was very rude on their part to think asking a married person without the spouse would be ok unless they knew you personally hate rides. They should have asked a single friend if they wanted to round out the group.", "NTA - I would be pissed. But my husband wouldn\u2019t go without me if I wasn\u2019t invited so", "NTA. Your husband should decline the invitation out of respect for you.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't invited and to turn up anyway would just cause shit, the asshole here is the SIL for this stupid situation.", "NTA. It was rude to invite your husband but not you. Your husband should decline the invitation if they do not want you along. If they only had one extra guest pass, they should have explained the situation and said that the second person would have to pay.", "NTA. First action of his, esp. after seeing the exchange, should have been to clarify with  SIL why his wife didn\u2019t appear to be invited.", "[removed]", "NTA. I stand by this philosophy as well - if you want me to come you need to specifically ask me. I do not read minds and don't want to waste my time or energy wanting to make plans for something I wasn't invited to.", "I wonder why the husband had the impression that OP didn't want to go. What or who made him think that? NTA", "NTA -  my ex would also have picked up a fight for having discussed it with my friends \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA. They probably didn\u2019t think of it as, \u201cwe don\u2019t want her present, we\u2019re excluding her!\u201d But they definitely were thoughtless and not respectful of the fact you and your husband are a unit and it\u2019s not normal to invite one without the other. Im going with it as ignorant rudeness on their part. Not purposeful but still rude. Maybe some etiquette they need to learn.", "I don't understand why couples can't do things separately, especially when it's with family.   Dynamics are different when partners are present, so independent time with others is important.", "NTA they definitely did not invite you", "NTA.   They made it real clear that they were inviting only your husband.   I wonder what he heard from them?", "NTA\n\nOP please ask your husband if someone called him and asked if \u2018they could steal you for a day\u2019 would he automatically think he was also invited?   \n\nYou were purposely excluded as they want an even number of people as I suspect on a number of rides seat people in twos.  \n\nBottom line tell him, if he\u2019s so sure it was you misunderstanding that clear text, to chat with his brother\u2019s wife.", "It\u2019s too late to have a good time at the amusement park.\n\nNTA", "NAH.  I can't see a problem with inviting one half of a couple generally, and espeically in a case like this where it seems to be about even numbers and matching against passes.  OP feeling hurt by it is her choice as subsequent events show that no insult or slight was intended.", "Nta it\u2019s kinda rude for them to have asked you knowing they weren\u2019t inviting you. Why is your husband going? I kinda expect him to realize how rude it was and say no", "Yta", "Isn\u2019t it like a BOGO situation?  I don\u2019t see this as weird at all, but then I\u2019ve never believed husband and wife must be joined at the hip.  Seems like much ado about nothing.\n\nThat said, however, if hubby starts acting distant in the future it might be prudent to tail SIL\u2019s sister.", "Your husband, like most, just doesn\u2019t want to be bothered with dealing with it. He needs to ask, otherwise it will look bad on you that your there.  \u201cYou were jealous, blah blah. Couldn\u2019t let him go for a day.\u201dIf he refuses to ask, stand your ground. You weren\u2019t invited. SIL has a good idea, only it\u2019s being rude to you.  Your husband needs to let his sil know he isn\u2019t ok with her leaving you out for no good reason. Your adults. Why does the number have to be even? \ud83d\ude44\n\nIs her sister single? Is she trying to set your husband up,  only ask cuz I\u2019ve seen it before on here.", "NTA \n\nThey were assholes because they invited your husband to keep SILs sister company. You weren\u2019t invited bc then the SILs sister would be solo again. You\u2019re not reading into it - that\u2019s what happened and it\u2019s inappropriate and disrespectful to you.", "NTA\n\nBUT seriously OP   What is your SIL\u2019S problem??? She\u2019s CLEARLY gone out of her way to be SPITEFUL!!  There was no need to text you, she OBVIOUSLY has or can get your husband\u2019s number from his brother. \n\nSomeone needs to find out what she\u2019s playing at.", "She deliberately asked you for permission to invite your husband. That\u2019s like asking a twin if their other twin can come to your birthday party. Neither you nor twin A gets invited, and it\u2019s pretty damn obvious you never were going to be asked. NTA!", "She asked if she could steal husband for the day. That's pretty self explanatory. She's not invited.", "NTA - asking to \u201csteal your husband for the day\u201d isn\u2019t an invite to join.", "In this case YTA. She took her sister and he took his brother so it wasn\u2019t really a couples thing. \n\nYou were never going to be invited so it\u2019s shitty to make your husband feel bad. Of course your BIL\u2019s wife would rather take her sister than you. Grow up.", "I'm so confused by your actual question. You explicitly weren't invited. And that's okay....there is nothing wrong with them saying she's bringing her sister and he's bringing his brother. There are certain types of activities where spouses are expected to go together but that's not everything. Rides are often paired off, so the sisters will go together and the brothers will go together. \n\n\nYou would NTA for not going, in fact, you would be an AH for going when explicitly not invited. Your husband could choose whether or not he's interested in going with his brother. \n\n\nI'm wondering why his brother didn't just invite him, but I'm guessing he was just worried that your husband explicitly say no if he was the one who had to explain to you that he was invited and you weren't.", "In baseball, the saying is, \u201cYou\u2019re out!\u201d You received a very distinct unvitation to the amusement park when you were asked if they could borrow your husband, and only your husband, for the day. You are NTA. Enjoy having a day to yourself.", "I would have been upset too and I don't even like amusement parks.\n\nYou should take the day and spend it at a spa and have a wonderful relaxing time.", "NTA. Unnecessary drama they stupidly created for your husband. You know that if you want to go you can, but that\u2019s not the point. The whole pig/lipstick\u2026well now you know who she is and you are one up!!! \nI\u2019d take a day for myself and let everyone project what THEY THINK I feel, while I let it go and enjoy peace!!!", "You are NTA. It would be absolutely weird and bizarre for you to go now. It would be reminiscent of the times when you\u2019re a kid and you exclude somebody from your class from your birthday party because you just don\u2019t like them and then some adult makes you invite the kid? So the kid shows up and nobody really wants them there and the kid knows nobody wants them there and everybody feels weird. Your husband seems to be entirely missing the point that he was supposed to go so that there were two groups of two so that nobody was left being the odd man out on a ride. They weren\u2019t inviting him because they enjoy his company or have some special affection for either of you. They were inviting him to be his sister\u2018s husband\u2018s babysitter essentially.\n\nAnd it is considered the height of rudeness to invite one member of a couple and not the other to a social event. There are obvious exceptions for this, such as a gender exclusive event, or like a simple dinner out or something like that. But a social event? Yeah no \u2014 that\u2019s rude.", "Your HUSBAND should have asked if you could join them and offered to buy you a ticket. The fact that he didn't says a lot about him.", "NTA in the least. But I do have a question. Did your husband\u2019s sister/brother/family communicate to him that you didn\u2019t want to go or is he assuming you didn\u2019t want to go? Because if they told him that then you absolutely know they\u2019re lying to him and then a larger and more serious conversation needs to be had. Also, I\u2019m a firm believer that if I wasn\u2019t invite then I\u2019m not going no exceptions. It\u2019s rude and presumptions to assume you\u2019re invited somewhere, if they wanted you there then they should have asked you to attend. If your husband needs clarification on it, then he should ask as they are his family. It\u2019d be pretty shitty of your husband to go without you knowing other spouses were invited and that they\u2019re excluding you btw. Either way, I\u2019d plan on missing more of their events personally and I\u2019d do my own thing with my family or friends.", "Your SIL asked you first because she knew it was a weird request and they were excluding you. She was trying to minimize damage and sell it to your husband that you didn't want to go. Whole thing is shadey.Someone else made the response that amusement park rides can tend to be very date like. Something's off, otherwise she would have had her husband ask your husband.", "Uh, we don't have a \"You're the whiny petty one\" who is now unwilling to adjust your feelings in light of a reasonable explanation. That was too harsh, changing to NAH, but I think your husbands interpretation is correct and you are going overboard with insisting you are not wanted.\n\nLook, they invited him because they had a certain number of free invites. It was awkward to not invite you, too, hence the \"steal your husband\" phrasing, but you were certainly welcome to come along if willing to pay admission, they just didn't have a free pass for you.", "They invited him so her husband wouldn\u2019t feel like a third wheel.  If you come, her husband is 5th wheel.  She was red to bring a friend for her husband so she could spend the day with her sister. It\u2019s rude, but not intentionally.", "Ehh, NAH. I think they didn't specifically invite you because they only had one spare pass. However, I doubt they'd object to you coming, they just didn't want to pay for a spare ticket. I'd say it's leaning towards they were a bit thoughtless, but I don't think they were maliciously thoughtless.", "I wouldn't be surprised if your SIL was stirring the pot on purpose. I have a borderline sister and this is exactly what she would do, then have an uproar about how petty you are and how victimized she is. Over and over again.", "When they wanted to \u201csteal\u201d your husband for the day, they made it very obvious you weren\u2019t invited.", "I don\u2019t think the SIL meant anything bad or personal about it but you are taking it very personal. I\u2019m not really tryin to pick sides but it sounds like your taking it personally and kinda taking it out on your husband. Just be the bigger person and go with your husband he obviously wants you there and to enjoy the day with you and his brother.", "NTA except I don\u2019t think it\u2019s automatic to invite spouses maybe they just wanted the siblings which is totally fair. You\u2019re not entitled to be invited to all things when it\u2019s special non-holiday hangs. There\u2019s nothing stopping anyone from hanging with their siblings without their spouses.\n\n*However* it was utterly rude to invite him via OP or check with you if you weren\u2019t invited. They should\u2019ve gone straight to husband and explained they wanted siblings only trip and for him to check with you.", "I\u2019m confused about why it\u2019s wrong for the sisters to want to spend the day with their brother? It\u2019s not like their husbands were going..seems like it was just a sibling day. How is that rude? I ask my siblings to spend time with me and don\u2019t always invite their husbands..married couples have lives outside of marriage and need to maintain their individual relationships too. I\u2019d be quite frankly pissed if i invited, say, my friend to lunch and her husband got angry that I didn\u2019t invite him too.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in your shoes with my SIL on more than one occasion. I don\u2019t want to be anywhere I\u2019m not specifically invited to.", "NTA. And you got a hubs problem. He just taught his bro that he\u2019s allow to snub his wife.", "This is weird. Is your husband not capable of making his own decisions and speaking to his sister in law himself? Why would she even text you that?", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude that they didn\u2019t invite you. husbands and wives can have separate friend groups. but i also don\u2019t think it\u2019s petty that you accepted your non invite and acted appropriately. what would be rude is if either one of you insisted that you go even though it was made pretty clear that you weren\u2019t the person they were excited about seeing \n\ndo you two often have individual social lives, or is this a new situation?", "NTA\n\nI would still go maybe invite a friend too, or a relative of yours. \n\nTbh, it sounds dodgy that they would even ask this. It's not only rude but disrespectful and sounds like a double date to me. \n\nNTA go and invite a friend/ family member so it is still even numbers and they can't complain.", "Ah man you\u2019re NTA but I invite myself everywhere.", "Is this a communication error, or an inadvertent snub? Did your husband even ask if you were invited? You didn\u2019t go because you weren\u2019t specifically invited, but someone could have asked \u201cHey, mind if my wife attends with us?\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA and my husband would never go without me. If I wasn\u2019t invited he is not going.", "NTA, it's weird to me that they asked through you! But also the idea of married people doing everything together is new to me. It's freaking me out because I'm at an age where my friends are starting to get married and I'm confused if I should start inviting their partners to our hangouts even though all of my hangouts have been 1 on 1 or friend group without girlfriends/boyfriends there", "NTA.  Husband shouldn't want to go either since they didn't invite you and lied about it.", "I wonder if sister in law is trying to set her sister up with op\u2019s hubby", "NTA. Either they didn\u2019t want you there, or they just assumed you were an accessory that comes attached to him, not worth being individually addressed.", "NTA at all", "They only had the one Pass you would have to pay if you wanted to go. It wasn't mentioned to you. You definitely weren't invited. Tell hubby you already planned a Spa day and can't go. He can go have fun with the sister", "Your SIL and husband are the aholes, not you.", "NTA and your not being petty at all. You must feel so left out and that sucks. Your husband not being able to see that and show any sensitivity makes him a numpty.", "NTA - people mean what they say. For example recently my fianc\u00e9s cousin got married and the ENTIRE family was invited to the bridal shower except me. Even family not related to the bride/groom the only relation through my fiance people they don\u2019t even see on holidays but not me. \n\nI didn\u2019t give them a wedding gift and left as soon as my fiance let me. He was on board because he also didn\u2019t understand why I was targeted. \n\nIt is what it is", "I don't think YTA but it was passive agressive to say you didn't mind when they checked with you. Your feelings are valid and important. It's ok to say \"I'm hurt that you are excluding me\". Or to ask if there is a reason you are not invited, because it is hurtful. Sending hugs, that sort of thing doesn't feel good.", "They didn't say \"We want to borrow both of you\", their position was \"We want to borrow your husband\".\n\nThey also could have explained the situation that a ticket would need to be purchased, so the voucher issue isn't a genuine factor.\n\nIt's a rude snub on their part, and extra salt in the wound was involving you in the planning. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhy would they ask you if your husband could go anywhere? \n\nDo they think you give him permission for activities? \n\nThat's just weird.\n\nDo they not have his phone number?\n\nIs SIL a pot stirrer with a little drama sprinkled in?", "Couples are like salt and pepper and travel together.\n\nIt would have been different if your BIL reached out directly to your husband in a way. Texting you that you weren't invited as a way to extend an invite to your husband was the height of rudeness to my thinking.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s brother has zero other friends who could have joined? Rude and inappropriate.", "Ntah", "Yta - it's a \"sibling\" day out to equal 4. The only way it would make sense for you to come is if they had another person to make the rides even. The fact that they messaged you at all is weird to me. Your husband is a grown man who can schedule his own play dates - except apparently not, which is why they reached out to you first.", "NTA. They asked to borrow him for the day. If they wanted to invite you too they would have chosen different words.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with your husband going to something without u but it\u2019s weird they asked u not him. If you were hurt you had the chance to say something and that you\u2019d pay for yourself. But I\u2019ll say NAH as I don\u2019t think anything sounds deliberate.", "NTA. One time my husbands friends were all going to come over and play some game, like Katan or something but you could only have 6 players, so me and his friend's wife couldn't play. Fine, I thought, I'll just hang out with her. A few days before the game she was somehow allowed to play but I wasn't, so I made plans with my other friends and went out to dinner. Leaving them to play their game without a \"host\" - I would have bought refreshments and whatever. I was pissed. They shouldn't have held this thing at my house when I couldn't even play (they weren't even going to allow teams). Fuck that noise", "Nta and you aren't bring petty. Years ago my partner and I went on a camping trip with a bunch of so called friends to a dam. All up there was 6 jetskis in the group, 1 which was ours. One morning a couple of the other ladies in the group decided it would be a good idea to go on a girls trip on the skis but they were a ski short so they wanted to borrow our ski but I wasn't invited to go along with them. Partner when asked about borrowing the ski asked why they needed to borrow it and why one of the others couldn't just double up on the ski with me and that's when he was also told I wasn't invited on the trip. He not so politely told them to get fucked and we ended up packing up our gear and leaving. Turns out a couple of the people didn't even want us to go in the first place but because we had the ski they thought we would just let them take it whenever.", "Nta. This situation is full of backwards thinking. You're response/reaction is completely understandable if not watered down. I'd be insanely mad. Like making plans and not telling someone when you don't want them around is one thing. But to call and practically tell the person you don't want them there is a totally different sort of rude. AND THEN for her to lie about it to your husband, ridiculous. If that's petty then stay petty", "The SIL was dumb and wasn\u2019t thinking. The real problem is the husband not backing her up", "NTA your husband and SIL are. They deliberately excluded you. Your husband is making you be the bad guy when you aren\u2019t. Tell him no sex for a month until he gets his priorities straight. Sorry for you.", "Oh, they meant it that way. otherwise they would have said 'we have passes for 4, but we'll all pitch in so you can come too.' NTA. I wouldn't want to go either. That was rude.", "YTA. Your husband is her sister's date. SIL is being sneaky and rude. You should absolutely show up. And bring another friend.", "NTA - not inviting you was completely intentional on their part.\n\nWhy?  That\u2019s the interesting part", "NTA", "NTA. It's both rude and they probably didn't mean it. Faux pas on their part. You weren't being petty. Anyone would want to bow this one out", " NTA  but you should be thankful you not only don't have to go to the amusement park with your in-laws ...but you also get the whole day to yourself", "NAH Looks to me like they only needed 1 more person because yeah\u2026even numbers work out better at amusement parks. Especially NAH because SIL reached out to wife before husband. Seems like intentions were innocent and not personal.", "YTA. You are being petty. There's nothing rude about two sisters and two brothers wanting to spend some time together. Just because you're married doesn't mean you have to spend every waking hour with each other.", "Abit of an AH \n\nBecause your behaving in a way that THEY HAVW TO INVITE YOU  BECAUSE YOUR MARRIED and it's not true married people often get invited to diferente thing but not the spouse that's A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP \n\nIf you want to go and be invited everywhere he gets invited to its really tedious", "\"My husband says they probably didn't mean it in that way...\"\n\nOh, they meant it in EXACTLY that way.\n\nNTA.", "Did sil want OP's husband to keep his brother company, or to keep her girlfriend company?  I mean, which way do you think they're planning to pair up for rides?  I think OP's husband should be asking some questions.", "No you are not being petty, or an AH.  It is totally disrespectful, and ignorant.  That age group (27-35) is always selfish and never thinks of others.  If the shoe was on the other foot, how would they feel???  Just make plans to have a beautiful life without those family members, and don't par take in their petty sh\\*t.  Next time, let them know you and your husband have other plans, whether it is true or not.  Make a list of things you plan to do soon...and keep it by the phone.  I don't know where you live, but I am sure there are plenty of out door activities you both enjoy....golfing, mini golf, hiking, boating, camping, swimming, fishing, etc.  And make sure you don't invite them, let them get the hint that you don't need them either.", "Nta for feeling excluded. I think you should go with. \n\nI may be seeing this wrong,  but it looks to me like she has her sister in town and the three are going to an amusement park.  She wants to spend the day with her sister, but her husband may feel left out while they do talk girl talk, so she asked her brother to come too. \n\nIn this instance,  there is no reason to keep op from coming. They both can hang out with her hubby. \n\nBut,  most rides seat pairs, and this is probably the goal of the invite. I really don't think that is as big of an issue, tho one person can sit behind...", "I\u2019m on the fence about your SIL but you\u2019re NTA. I understand they wanted an even number of people and the day is for siblings and for no one to feel left out. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the day being without you but I don\u2019t understand why she asked you instead of talking to your husband. Also don\u2019t know why they lied to your husband. It\u2019s good for couples to do things without each other but you\u2019re not the ah for being upset because the way they went about it was weird.", "Sorry, but to my mind, your husband shouldn't go.  Not inviting you was rude.  Very rude.  Beyond rude, running into mean girl territory.\n\nThey could have explained the pass situation and you and your husband could have split the cost had you chosen to do so.\n\nThe days when a man requires another man or he'll feel sooooo left out his little masculine heart will break have long since passed.  I think that the last rule that required a man to have a male buddy if females are present died and was buried in 1954.\n\nYou are not being petty, but your husband is being an A.  His sister was rude to his wife, ergo he doesn't participate in the event that excludes his wife for no apparent reason beyond rudeness and (let's face it) meanness.  Only a grown-up mean girl would pull a stunt like this.  He shouldn't reward it.\n\nHe's calling you petty?  I'll give you petty.  Take a girlfriend and go to a local resort that weekend.  If you have kids, hire a sitter.  Let him find your petty ass is in Vegas, or Florida, or the mountains, or wherever when he gets home from dissing you at an amusement park that requires adult men to have a male buddy, even if this involves dissing their wives.  (Just a thought.)\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t have a problem generally with one person being invited out of a couple for social occasions.\n\nThe one and only time I ever made an issue out of it deserved it. My FIL\u2019s birthday was coming up. The adult children are gathered around for a family dinner. They decide they\u2019ll take him to a hockey game, siblings only. My BIL pointed to his wife and I and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not coming!\u201d Not polite or tactful, but sure. Do your thing.\n\n\nLater, my husband is on the phone about the number of tickets. They needed 5. They are looking for 7. Hold the phone, why? My siblings in law are bringing their bf and gf. WTF?!  Weren\u2019t we all at the same table when this plan was hatched? Why are they included? \u201cNo one wanted to tell them they weren\u2019t invited\u201d. Why did they even think they were invited? Never got a satisfying answer to my logical line of questioning.\n\nYou at least have an answer. The couple wants to take their own siblings for free. No one wants to pay for a ticket.

Not hearing her listed, he might be wondering why she wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nOp is NTA. It\u2019s rude to go to events you haven\u2019t been invited to. If a friend of hers invited her to lunch, it would be rude if her to bring her husband along. If a child gets invited to a birthday party, it\u2019s rude to send their uninvited sibling with them. The best thing would\u2019ve been for the invitees to suck it up and just take the SIL\u2019s sister and made sure to use the time for some bonding between those inlaws and not invited anyone that\u2019s in a couple that doesn\u2019t go to events by themselves. Although maybe this is I\u2019ll be their first time learning that this couple does not go to things individually.

The husband should be stepping up to say that isn\u2019t ok and taking a pass on the day to spend it with his wife.", "Anyone who had that first conversation with her would assume she didn't want to go, because she didn't ask if she could come. It's frankly bizarre that she's acting excluded and hurt when She could have gotten what she wanted, in almost certain likelihood, with just a few words. They invited her husband because he's the guy who's friends with the other guy. They probably just assumed that She wasn't interested when she didn't say anything.", "There's a number of possible reasons for that. It's shady they assumed/claimed that OP didn't *want* to go when she was never invited, but not necessarily that the SIL checked in first.\n\nFirst of all, there's the whole expectation that women manage the family thing, which could be fairly prevelant depending on where they live.\n\nBut more importantly, you generally make a call to the partner first because you're concerned that *they* might feel concerned/threatened/uncomfortable and want them to know what's going on. It's actually polite in certain instances, since if said partner says that they wouldn't be comfortable with that, it's not a good time, etc. then you never proffer the full invitation and it spares the couple possible strife.\n\nIn this case, it was most likely the SIL letting OP know that her sister would be there but this was meant to be more of a sibling hang out (her with her sister, BIL with OP's husband) so there shouldn't be any issues and check that she was cool with it. Which she claimed she was, despite having issues with it/being hurt by it. \n\nGiven that OP's response to her husband being invited to a sibling hang out, where the stated intent is for him to hang out with his brother, and her being there would make it far more a coupley thing, is to feel hurt and excluded and think it's \"weird\" that she wasn't invited to the *sibling day out*, it's pretty reasonable that SIL was concerned she might have an issue with it. So SIL called to check, was told that it was fine, is not a mind reader and thus assumed that meant OP was okay with it, and proceeded with that. If your friend/family member's partner has shown in the past that they are likely to have issues with certain types of things and you *aren't* looking to cause problems with the relationship, you talk to them about it first and don't extend the invite if it's going to be a whole thing(eg. if your sister's husband has expressed issues with her looking at other men partially nude, you check with him BEFORE inviting him to your party held at the local club full of male strippers). The issue here is that SIL said OP didn't want to come when that was never made clear, not that OP was called first (polite in many circles) or even really that she wasn't invited to begin with (understandable if they were going for a sibling vibe- especially since SIL and BIL are the ones paying/taking the siblings) although that can be kind of rude sometimes", "That's what I thought.  The implication of 'steal' is that OP won't have her husband that day, so she definitely wasn't invited.", "Good point!", "Maybe they don\u2019t want wife to come. It\u2019s ok for just husband to go.", "Exactly, why is the wife required to manage the husband  like he's some star athlete?", "You are ass backwards. You don\u2019t say \u201ccan I come\u201d when the invite is specifically extended to the husband ONLY. That is what \u201cstealing your husband for a day\u201d means. Are ppl really this ignorant. OP was out in a no win situation intentionally by the SIL.", "And who the fuck wants to go to an amusement park with Marjorie Taylor Green?", "Hahaha. Except the couple dong the inviting is a married couple and they are creating another couple to attend with them minus a spouse. If you think this isn\u2019t rude then you are or will be a shitty partner. Tell me what harm would there be in asking OP to come as well? They aren\u2019t riding in a 4 person sleigh. Jesus.", "It's crazy to me that people here seriously believe their partners aren't allowed to make plans or go places without them haha. Am I seriously not allowed to invited my brother out for the day without inviting his wife too? I'm pretty sure she's not a toddler and she has her own friends and things she likes to do. I guess my girlfriend must also be an AH because she's currently visiting her brother interstate. Jfc lol.", "This comment is so ridiculous. They aren\u2019t children. The whole idea of a \u201csiblings only\u201d trip to the amusement park as married adults is laughable. Pretending like one more woman (the wife) attending would have ruined the trip is even more ridiculous.

She loves his wife but they are constantly attached at the hip to the point that even when you do get him in the phone he\u2019s definitely on speaker. Maybe OP and her husband are kind of like that, he\u2019s difficult to nail down so they just call OP. It\u2019s annoying but should that mean OPs husband misses out on hanging out with his brother just because doing so necessitates going through OP. She\u2019s entitled to her hurt feelings but I agree it\u2019s entirely possible this was simply meant to be a sibling day.

I wouldn\u2019t find it nefarious.", "Not necessarily.\n\nWhile I do fully agree that OP is NTA for how she reacted/feels, and it's understandable she feels excluded (and the saying she didn't want to come is shady on the SIL's part), in a lot of cases a call like that is made to try and PREVENT someone feeling excluded/being worried. \n\nIn the same way a woman might ask her male best friend's GF if it's cool for him to come to something with her because she has two tickets and wants him there before putting the question to him directly- you're supposed to be checking with the partner to make sure that they're okay with their partner going without them/won't have an issue with him being around unattached people (the SIL's sister in this case). Granted, that can be kind of pushy/manipulative to do, it just depends on the situation and how it's handled.\n\nI will say to OP- it's not that weird to invite one partner of a married couple and not the other, especially if it's a \"hang out with the siblings\" event and not a \"family vacation\" or \"couples\" event, which is how it sounds here. Them lying about you saying you didn't want to go is rude, obviously, and it's a bit weird that it's your SIL making the invitation rather than the BIL to your husband, but it's quite possible that this came from a place of wanting the siblings to be able to hang out rather than a deliberate attempt to exclude you. Idk what the situation is like, but especially if the brothers don't spend a lot of time together it's understandable for your SIL to try and make time for them to do that- and in that case her calling you first was probably meant to be a way to make it clear that was what she was doing and give you a chance to speak up if you were uncomfortable, felt excluded, really wanted to go, etc.\n\nThat being said, at this point it's perfectly reasonable to go or not go, whichever would make you most comfortable :)", "That\u2019s fine and dandy and I also agree, but don\u2019t lie about not inviting OP and saying she said she didn\u2019t want to go.", "Because this is clearly a family outing.

Just an assumption on your part", "This is implied by readers it was not said by OP", "They're saying it was socially inept to invite someone through a person who is not invited, and that there was no reason the husband shouldn't have been able to decide if he was able to attend because he should be just as aware of family's plans as OP is.", "This is Reddit; MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX CANT BE NEAR EACH OTHER WITHOUT FUNKY BUSINESS GOING ON.", "Really? That seems super weird to me. I\u2019d trust the person to do whatever checking with a spouse was needed. I guess maybe if you didn\u2019t know the spouse as well, but then why invite them to a fun day out? The guy not wanting to be the third wheel could have asked the husband, which would have made all this less weird. It\u2019s very passive and indirect, and I think the OP is correct to feel deliberately excluded and unhappy about it. So NTA.", "That\u2019s really weird to do. My husband and I\u2019s friends and family ask us directly to go do something and we check with each other to see if there\u2019s already plans for that day/time.

Rather, they asked for the husband, because the husband is the person they have a connection to. Anything more than that is trying to read too much into things and describe too many sinister intentions to the husband's friends.\n\nIf she wants to go, she could simply, casually, ask if he can come. Instead of doing that though, she's decided to play the martyr and get twisted into a knot over having been \"excluded\" and resent everyone around her for nobody reason.\n\nIt's remarkably passive aggressive and socially over elaborate to try to have her husband Go and talk to someone she was already talking to to ask a question she already could have asked. It's abject silliness. And it creates drama where drama doesn't need to exist.", "Why worry with anything if momma's going to take care of everything?\n\nHey, I'm married now, why worry with anything if wife can take care of everything?\n\nIt's not about liking, it's convenient to have someone do all the worry and have someone tell you just have to do x, out go to y place by z hour\n\nMen are babies all their lives", "No wonder they desperately want women to be in the kitchen for them, they can't feed themselves otherwise!", "Just speaking anecdotally from my relationship and my buddies\u2019 relationships, we guys don\u2019t feel the need to really schedule all that much. Sure if we\u2019re going to shows and stuff that require planning we\u2019ll contribute to the coordination of that, but just hanging out with friends on a random Saturday night can be more of just a couple texts that day to figure out what\u2019s going on.

Women can harness the chaos of men.\n\nIf no one else is involved (no family responsibilities, no wife), men will generally do whatever they want, when they feel like it, and semi-impulsively. Lack of self-control, perhaps a really good heart, a thoughtful and caring disposition. \n\nYet, for the aforementioned reasons, single men have a high mortality rate and suffer from things like alcoholism, violence, crime, suicide, or just outright laziness or selfishness. \n\nWhen a man is left to himself, he can become a menace unto himself\u2026 enter women: when paired semi-right, the women forces the man to be confronted by his demons and shortcomings, aware of his strengths and responsibilities. \n\nThe women also threatens him with enough fear of loss that he\u2019s able to fight his natural self-destructive instincts: he will rise to the occasion! (Or so he hopes, because he wants to be a hero/ you\u2019ve given him purpose!) Yet, they are still men and menaces unto themselves.\n\nThis isn\u2019t always the case, but this is a general historic consensus that\u2019s so old that the stats and stereotypes are proven both traditionally and scientifically", "Also...why does it have to be divided along gender lines?

I assumed he was asking because he was trying to explain why she wasn\u2019t going, meaning his brother hadn\u2019t given any explanation at all.

With 3 people the husband is going to end up primarily riding with a stranger if they all ride, and with 5 it\u2019ll either be the husband or OP that ends up with a stranger.
