I M23 had issues with my dad after my mom died and my stepmom came along. I hated a lot of decisions that were made, but what has left a long lasting impact was taking my college fund to pay for my stepbrother's surgeries. Unfortunately, he's dead (died last year at the age of 16 from a chronic heart problem). I put my distance but still see my grandparents and uncles, aunts, cousins etc.\n\n\nWith the holiday season coming up, dad started talking to me through some relatives - close relatives. He went on about his overwhelming feelings of lonliness, his upcoming divorce and invited me to spend christmas with him because he's alone and heartbroken. As a response, I told him I'll GLADLY spend christmas with him if he gives back my college fund in a form of a christmas gift. He and the others didn't like my response. He thought this was harsh and my relatives said that I was a judgemental, petty, greedy asshole to say this to him after he's lost so much. They said he did all he could to save his stepson (my stepbrother) life which they described as \"noble\" and that he doesn't owe me a thing. I went home after a big argument with my uncle who came at me for what I said.\n\n\nNow I feel like shit. Maybe I should've just calmly, politely declined the invite and not said this to him and made him feel guilty for how he handled my stepbrother's situation.\n\n\nEDIT I just took a look and I see that I'm getting a shitload of comments here. To answer few questions:\n\n1_the fund was made by my dad, mom was a sahm and didn't work but they both agreed that this fund would go towards my edication. 2_I was able to get in college, I started working to pay my way and had some relatives help but my uncle did so much for me which is why I said felt like shit when he berated me. He holds a special place in my life and he's the last person I want to disppoint or let down.", "created_utc": 1668884232, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzj7p0/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_ill_gladly_spend/", "score": 2880, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was it ever a conversation between you and your dad - or was it you being told what would happen?\n\nAll of these factors come into play.  Even if there wasn't a \"fund\" which typically has more to do with tax implications, there is the sense that you were promised something and then it was taken away from you. Of course that feels unfair.  However, sometimes families need to re-prioritize based on need - and perhaps this is what happened, but it's not clear enough.

In our case, we will pay our children\u2019s undergraduate tuition and provide assistance with graduate school. We have been putting money in tax advantaged college funds since the kids were born in order to make sure we are able to give them the gift of a college education at the college of their choice - provided they get admitted.\n\nUnder the law those fund are ours and we can change the beneficiaries subject to certain restrictions.

Until he does so, rather than the \"I'm a victim how dare you hold me accountable dance\", he deserves the distance you have put between you.\n\nAnd while your comment was *slightly* harsh, I think every one of use would feel the want to say something similar if we were made to feel second in a situation that affected the rest of our lives.", "NTA\nHis upcoming divorce?\nSo step mom is divorcing your dad after her son died?", "NTA for feeling the way you feel about the college money.

What you said was a bit harsh, not gonna lie, but I doubt it came from a place where you were being greedy or petty. Money does not grow on trees. Also, this may sound rude but it is his stepson, he is not his child, did your stepbrother have his dad in the pictures? What was his mom doing? Why did your dad think the only possible solution is taking your college fund? Why would he try to take your education from you. If he wanted to help he could've got some loan from a bank even sold some gold if he had any or borrowed money from his relatives.

Dad made the unilateral decision to spend the fund I assume without consulting with op first then he has every right to be upset.\n\nSpending someone's else's college fund to save a life may sound all nobel n all in theory but reality is quite different. It also depends on how his relationship with his dad was prior to all this.\n\nIf OP was expecting money from his dad because his dad did promise him that. \n\nSaving a life is really important but if you do it at someone else's expense (in this case op future and his relationship with his dad) then there's really no meaning to it.\n\nFrom the post it also sounds like op dad didn't prioritize him and only now made an effort when he lost everything. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.

Reading behind the lines, this is probably one of many incidents of your father prioritizing his new family over you. For so many children, distribution of financial resources is seen as a proxy for love. That\u2019s also why disinherited children take it so personally. To be really clear, THIS ISN\u2019T JUST ABOUT MONEY. \n\nYou never owe anyone a trip for the holidays.

It doesn't always work out that way. And it is still the parents money. If they have a change in financial needs, they can legally use the money for other needs. \n\nThe money never belongs to the child. Even if it is used for college, the parent usually gives out portions as needed. In other words, it was never your money. \n\nI understand you feel this is your dad choosing your stepbrother over you. In reality, he was trying to help your stepbrother not die. \n\nImagine if you had your life threatened, and your dad used the money for a life-saving operation. And it worked. Would you still feel he owed you a college fund? Would you think he made the wrong choice in paying to try to save you?\n\nI don't think your issue is the money. In your brain, maybe it is. But I think in your heart, you feel your dad chose him over you. I don't think getting the money back is as important to you as your dad making a grand gesture to show his love and prove he is sorry. The money part is to hurt him like he hurt you.\n\nYou mom passing away is enough to give you abandonment issues. To have your dad remarry and spend the college fund on his stepson would make most kids feel slighted. That is normal. \n\nIf you want to get past the anger you have at the situation, consider talking to someone about it. It could be a professional,  your uncle, or even your dad. But you need to talk about more than just money. You need to talk deeper, and address how all this made you feel. \n\nOr you could stay angry and avoid your family.", "YTA. Remember, you\u2019re NOT entitled to the money to begin with. Many parents send their child into the world with not a cent in their college fund. I don\u2019t know about the States, but in Canada, anyone can attend college with no money by taking out government loans. In this case, taking the money away did not take away opportunities, just made life as hard as it was to begin with. \nOn the other hand of making your life easier, was the life of a loved one on the line.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like there was a lot of resentment in how OP was treated once stepmom came along even before the college fund situation.

So normal way to save for a college education (assuming you are in the US) is a 529 account. There are certain tax benefits to doing this. Since it's a custodial account the IRS considers it part of the beneficiary's assets - NOT The parents. If your dad had a 529 and took money from it he is liable for the taxes he didn't pay PLUS a 10% penalty.  I understand your dad's position trying to save a life - but that was YOUR money he used.

Every pay period a set amount leaves the account I share with my husband and is deposited in each child\u2019s savings account.  From then on, that money is theirs.  If I (the person who controls access to the bank accounts) want to touch any of those accounts for any reason, I bring the affected child(ren) to my desk and explain what I want to do and get their consent first before doing anything.\n\nThe father in question emptied out one child\u2019s savings to benefit the other child.  The why is irrelevant.  He did this without the child who was losing assets giving consent, and if it had been anyone but a parent doing this it would be considered theft.  Giving birth to a child, or fathering a child, does ot give you the right to claim their assets for yourself.  The father in this case needs to understand what he did wrong, realize why it was wrong, and make proper amends.", "So your stepmom got your dad to drain your college fund, then leaves his ass, and now that he\u2019s all alone he wants you to come back?

One could argue that since he could help, your Dad had an obligation to do so. But that doesn't impress me either, because the reality is that anyone with money could walk down to a nearby hospital right now and exhaust their life savings helping (Or trying to help) someone who can't afford lifesaving treatment.  Healthcare in the US leaves people to die all the time.  I don't like that, but it's a political problem, solving it is beyond the scope of this discussion.  We all have to chose under what circumstances we're going to spend our money to help people.  For ourselves, for our spouses, for our children, for a friend, for a friend's children... Everyone who isn't broke has to draw that line somewhere, and does so.  All we're debating here is WHERE should your Dad have drawn that line?  \n\n\nYour Dad made his choice.  I'm not saying it was the wrong choice, but it was a choice with serious, probably lifelong, consequences for you.

Would you be more likely to donate a kidney to your sibling or your mailman?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd give up my college fund for a sibling's surgery, but probably not for some kid I saw on TV.  That's just human nature.", "What? It is different because there was a dying child in his home. Because that was his stepchild. \n\nThere was someone in his family that needed lifesaving care, and that costs money - stepparent or not, that\u2019s not an easy situation for any family, and it\u2019s wildly different than simply donating to charity.", "\"for the benefit of his stepbrother\" aka to try to save his fucking life?  I'm convinced half of this sub are children that lack any sense of empathy.", "Unless the money was donated by someone other than dad to fund the account, then he had 100% the right to use it for something else that he could never have planned for ahead of time. \n\nThis reminds me of kids who say things like \"my parents are spending my inheritance\", or who start deciding what they will do with the money before their parents are dead.  It's their money until it's legally yours, and they have a right to spend the money they earned and saved however they want to.   Yes, it would be really disappointing to be told that the college funds you were counting on got used for a family medical emergency, but that's life, shit happens, and you go on.   I suspect this was more about resentment towards the step-family than it was about the college fund.", "He had every right.

Do you really think his wife would have been able to look at him again if he didn't do everything possible to try to save her baby's life?  If her son had died and she felt the funds available to save him had been within reach and he'd denied them to her, that would have been the end of his marriage.\n\nUnless, as mentioned in the first comment, these were funds laid aside by his late wife, of course he had to drain his nest egg too.  They're a team.  If this was his late wife's money, then she should have made a relative of her family of origin the trustee - exactly so that the money couldn't have been used for OP's Stepbrother to begin with.  Then there wouldn't even have been an issue.", "An enormous number of marriages end in divorce after the loss of a child - add in all of the blended family/conflict aspects of the and the marriage Sur ing the stepbrothers death would be the anomaly.", "What a false equivalence. You owe your kid more effort and money than complete strangers. \n\nI'm sure it was a shitty situation, but the choice here was between saving your stepkid's literal life or your other kid not taking loans just like millions of others. \n\nYou don't \"have to\" provide your kid with expensive tertiary education, but you do have to prevent them from *dying* for the love of God", "Nope, that someone out there is sick and don't isn't the same as a child you are related to, even if only by marriage, is sick and dying.  And parents can set up college funds in good faith that their circumstances will stay the same and they will be able to hand off tens of thousands of dollars to their kids for college, but sometimes things happen.

God luck getting financial aid now - we are off to travel the world in your college fund\", in which case they were likely bastards before you got to college age, but short of that, if they decide they need some or all of the money for something else, that's the way it goes. \n\nI don't understand anyone feeling entitled to money someone else worked to earn, no matter what hardships come up.", "acting like there wasn't a chance the stepson could have survived", "> But OP's dad didn't drain his own savings\n\nDude...

And that's the reason EVERYONE in OP's family who knows the whole situation is against OP.\n\nEven the uncle that paid for his college in the end.\n\nYou really think the uncle who paid for OP's college would side with the dad... if the dad was swimming in money and used OP's college fund just for fun.\n\nJesus christ... how old are you? 3?", "A whole lot of unwarranted speculation here.", "He said it was 100% funded by dad.", "I clearly didn\u2019t say \u201cbe homeless\u201d.

There is something so truly fucked up about that, especially since we\u2019re talking about a child here.", "So you\u2019re telling me that if you are a kid and your parents moved some kid you have no history with into your house and declared that your college fund would now be dedicated to paying for this other kid\u2019s medical bills, you\u2019d be fine with that?", "Agreed. I genuinely believe most of this sub is populated by Gen Z with very little life experience.", "I am with you on this one. Saving someones life > a college fund.

Im willing to bet most people here have student loans and they relate to that \"pain\" of having to pay for school on their own.

Like, did his mom show up months before the surgery had to be done? Or was the father in the SBs life from the start, and raised him for 16 years as the only father he ever had? Those are two very different scenarios.\n\nThe college funds could've been paid for by just the father, the father and OPs bio mom, or by both the father and the step mom.

I would hope my stepdad would do the same for me. It\u2019s a LIFE, not a college education. OP can go to community college or trade school, their life isn\u2019t ruined.\n\nAll that being said it\u2019s totally valid for OP to be upset and to disagree with he decision, and to be resentful. But it\u2019s downright cruel to say something like that to their dad, who\u2019s lost two important people in his life and just wants to spend the holidays with another person he loves. To make reciprocation of that love dependent on money that wasn\u2019t just thrown out, it was spent trying to save his stepson. Honestly very cruel and OP needs to apologize to his dad and have an honest conversation about the resentment. Also take a step back and reevaluate priorities\u2026 this is a sad story.", "New trolley problem variant: you are on the trolley on the way to college. If you pull the lever to change tracks, you get a free ride scholarship. But there is a sick child on the other tracks and you will kill them if you switch.

It'd be unfortunate but if my bf told me his son, who doesn't live with us, was dying I'd also help by selling my assets. It'd make my life harder for sure and I'd basically have to start over but a life is always more important than money. There will always be more money", "I absolutely would. Which is more important, me going to college, or possibly saving someone's life? Its mind boggling to me that people think college is more important. There are such things as student loans, grants, scholarships etc. People only get one life to live. \n\nBut then again, I also live in Canada where there would never need to be a decision made like this. It's super fucked up that someone's life depends on if you can pay a bunch of money. \n\nI also suspect that there's a bit more going on here. It sounds like there's a ton of resentment on OP's part about his step mom and brother. I can totally understand him being upset about not having his college fund, that's fair. But asking his dad to all of a sudden come up with money that I'm sure he doesn't have especially if he's going through a divorce, is kinda rude. If he doesn't want to see his dad, that's his choice, but trying to use money as the only reason he'll come visit is ridiculous.", "Why is OP entitled to any money at all?

In a heartbeat.  \n\nAny country that forces this choice should be nationally ashamed.  Both of these things should be easily accessible for everyone.", "Yeah this. Sorry but that college fund was money his DAD saved. It was his dad's money. Money he earned and gets to decide what to do with. It's his dad's prerogative to decide if something else came up that needed that money more desperately. And absolutely trying to save someone's life is more important than a college fund.", "I agree. There is not enough information and those issues would potentially change my opinion. What struck me was OP\u2019s clear rage. As I said above, I suspect that this was just the last straw for OP and there is a lot more to the story.", "I don\u2019t think they do. I certainly don\u2019t.

You\u2019re a better person than me - I would resent the hell out of my dad spending money that had been set aside for my future, regardless of what else he spent it on.
