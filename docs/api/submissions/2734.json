I M23 had issues with my dad after my mom died and my stepmom came along. I hated a lot of decisions that were made, but what has left a long lasting impact was taking my college fund to pay for my stepbrother's surgeries. Unfortunately, he's dead (died last year at the age of 16 from a chronic heart problem). I put my distance but still see my grandparents and uncles, aunts, cousins etc.\n\n\nWith the holiday season coming up, dad started talking to me through some relatives - close relatives. He went on about his overwhelming feelings of lonliness, his upcoming divorce and invited me to spend christmas with him because he's alone and heartbroken. As a response, I told him I'll GLADLY spend christmas with him if he gives back my college fund in a form of a christmas gift. He and the others didn't like my response. He thought this was harsh and my relatives said that I was a judgemental, petty, greedy asshole to say this to him after he's lost so much. They said he did all he could to save his stepson (my stepbrother) life which they described as \"noble\" and that he doesn't owe me a thing. I went home after a big argument with my uncle who came at me for what I said.\n\n\nNow I feel like shit. Maybe I should've just calmly, politely declined the invite and not said this to him and made him feel guilty for how he handled my stepbrother's situation.\n\n\nEDIT I just took a look and I see that I'm getting a shitload of comments here. To answer few questions:\n\n1_the fund was made by my dad, mom was a sahm and didn't work but they both agreed that this fund would go towards my educatiotion. 2_I was able to get in college, I started working to pay my way and had some relatives help but my uncle did so much for me which is why I said felt like shit when he berated me. He holds a special place in my life and he's the last person I want to disppoint or let down.\n\n\nEDIT2 Okay for those who are saying the fund wasn't mine. Whose fund was it then? LMFAO I really don't get this maybe you can expand on how exactly the fund wasn't mine and to whom it belonged? Also, for those that think that I'm being cruel to my dad after he lost so much. I try not to go out of my way to be mean or malicious. Matter of fact, I want little to nothing to do with him but all this time I been playing nice to please my uncle and relatives but that's it.", "created_utc": 1668884232, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzj7p0/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_ill_gladly_spend/", "score": 13504, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was it ever a conversation between you and your dad - or was it you being told what would happen?\n\nAll of these factors come into play.  Even if there wasn't a \"fund\" which typically has more to do with tax implications, there is the sense that you were promised something and then it was taken away from you.

Being a sahm saves the family money in most cases, and provides a service that has monetary value.

I imagine she'd have done something with life insurance too if she had known. I think using half would have been OK because one can argue that mom's contributions via being a sahm amount to half of the account.\n\nI also think that dad and step mom could have gotten loans in the amount of 50% of OPs college fund. People get loans for medical bills. Especially for cases where someone needs long term,  expensive medical care. If OP is in the US, I seriously doubt his college fund even made a DENT in the overall cost of medical care for his step brother, whereas OP likely has student loans that have set him back in life by years.

A father who'd seriously reflected on how his actions hurt his son and understood the damage he'd done might be willing to pay back the financial element of the damage he'd done. A father who didn't really have a deep understanding of the emotional issues, and who felt entitled to op satiating his loneliness, not so much.

Same with myself, and I have incurred a significant medical expense without insurance in the past and I knew my parents weren\u2019t going to put money towards it because they knew it would be handled(they both work in healthcare, knew I\u2019d have to go on disability for a while, and I was at a research not for profit hospital). I was ready to handle a BK if I really had to, but I would never drag others into my financial mess, even if it was to \u201csave my life.\u201d\n\nThe way I see it, this money should have been in a trust to begin with because it\u2019s not really the money that\u2019s the issue, it\u2019s the lack of protection for your existing children before entering a new contract that can negatively impact them. This also isn\u2019t a situation where one could potentially get \u201cconsent\u201d from OP because they are still young and easier to coerce. It\u2019s a terrible situation, but the fault for how it was all handled goes to the parents. OP does have the right to ask for the concession before seeing his dad, especially since dad only wants play happy families because of the divorce, and dad has the right to be hurt, but I don\u2019t think he has the right to now go around to other family members and gather flying monkeys over the situation that he allowed.", "Stay at home parents have a right to the family income. It's kind of the whole point. For them to stay home and save money for the family while one can work and dedicate themselves to their career.", "This right here.

OP was owed that money. The reason why it was spent is irrelevant.", "Yes yes yes. This is exactly the correct take.", "Bio mom is dead. Dad can\u2019t get her approval.", "100% agree. Also another commenter posed some good unanswered questions (I'm on mobile and don't remember your u/ so if you see this I'm sorry!) like did they just go straight for OP's college fund? Was the stepbrothers maternal/paternal family not able to put forth money or were they even asked to? Did dad and stepmom use any emergency/retirement money they had saved up first?", "But did dad put himself in debt at all? Or did he just say \"No I don't want I take out a $__k loan so fuck my bio kid\"? Honestly, 50% should have been left alone in any case (mom of OP contribution), and then OP could have offered to give them the rest if he so chose. \n\nMedical bills exist. Medical debt exists. Adults are better equipped to be in debt than an 18yo. Especially one that was expecting there to be college money, and likely didn't even get the chance to save any himself beforehand. I see no mention of Dad putting himself in crippling debt and step bro being in life or death straights if they didn't get OP's college fund specifically.\n\nIf it's emergent care, I've never heard someone just dying, because the hospital didn't want to bill them for it without cash in hand. (Correct me if I'm wrong here seriously). \n\nI think it's on the parents here (presumably stepmother and stepbrother's dad), and OPs dad, to come up with the money. I know the compassionate thing to do would be help with the money, but there was almost definitely other avenues here that didn't involve taking the college fund. Likely that it was just -easier-. \n\nI totally understand the need and priority for medical care, but the reality is that in the US (which I think this is), debt is easy to acquire, and I think if the choice is to put an established adult into debt, or a fresh out of high school teen, I think it's always a better choice to pick the adult.", "I totally agree.  Dad only contacted OP when he was alone and getting divorced otherwise ignored him and seemed fine with NC. \nOP felt like he didn't matter when his dad married this woman and then icing on the cake?

This was a step child and the biological mother of said step child had no qualms about divorcing the person who paid for her child's surgery.

I'd rather go bankrupt than take my kids college money away when that momey was promised. When a kid grows up poor and they know they have to work to pay for college, its very different because they grew up knowing that. When you tell your kid they have momey coming and thus they choose to focus on studies and not bust their ass, it's not their fault when you just say \"oops sorry you no longer have that momey\"  you bank on your parents because they already saved that money FOR you. I highly doubt someone put a gun to the kids head and said \"pay up mow\". I'm in 80k medical debt currently in collections for a similar situation and guess what, the cops aren't busting down my door because putside of government debt, there is no debtors prison in America.

It was my parents\u2019 money, yes, but they invested in a specific account specifically for my education.

Part of that was he worked a strenuous job and had not only hurt his back at work but got a hernia. One night he went to the hospital believing he had kidney stones again even though the pain was different. They diagnosed him with a bowel blockage. They treated it until he had a bowel movement, then sent him home.\n\nTwo or three weeks later he was back. Same problem. Same treatment, no further diagnostic tests were run. Had a bm, sent him home.\n\nLess than a week after that he called an ambulance because the pain was so bad. The first two times, he had driven himself further to the better hospital so they took him to the local one, basically a band aid station, but procedure. That hospital took the recent history and transferred him to a bigger hospital in a different direction. They did no further testing, treated him the same as the first hospital and because someone recorded a bm on his i/o chart that he didn't have, they sent him home.\n\nJust shy of three days later, he again calls an ambulance. This time, whoever took him shared the history with a supervisor and I guess it was a slow night because they got permission to take him to a hospital a good bit further away that does a lot of charity work. \n\nLet me just add that we were sent a picture of him then by a cousin that went to visit him since he was visiting the area for work. My brother has always been thin but wiry and strong. Family had not seen him for about a year before that I think. (We don't get along ) The picture showed that he was not just too skinny, he was freaking EMACIATED. If he'd been an animal I would not have tried to save him. I can only conclude that because he admitted to smoking weed they figured he used other stuff and treated him like a drug addict who was pill seeking.\n\nThe new hospital did further testing immediately and had him in emergency surgery before the sun came up. His colon was almost completely blocked by tumors. He was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. The hospital social worker got his information and did the work to get disability for him. He received chemo for about a year and they bought him a short remission. It is back again though.\n\nI will grant you that getting diagnosed a month or so earlier would have made no real difference to how much time he had left. But he suffered constantly during that time. And sure, we are talking about someone who didn't have insurance even when he was working so he wouldn't have gotten an earlier diagnosis. \n\nHim not having insurance and no job absolutely had everything to do with why two separate hospitals (3 if you count the one that transferred) failed to do anything but the bare minimum the law required for him.\n\nEdited to improve word choice", "This.

Heart defect) community, both over the internet and in real life, as my best friend since kindergarten was born with multiple life threatening CHDs and has had over 100 surgeries in her lifetime (we are both 33f). So many of those I've known, esp the ones communicated thru over the internet, have had issues with life saving surgeries and not having the money to pay up front. For example, there was a little boy named Richie, his mama fought so goddamn hard for that sweet boy, and watching their journey was both inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. At one point it got especially dire and he needed heart Cath surgery and some other things done. The surgery would cost like many thousands of dollars and a month before he was to have the surgery they dropped the bomb that his parents would need to pay a certain, albeit impossible amount of money before they can hold the surgery date on schedule. It was a devastating blow as this surgery was 100% life and death. They even told them to call around to other hospitals and see if they could afford it better thru those hospitals. They couldn't bc they couldn't afford care flight to these hospitals and the hospital they were going thru his whole short little life up till then was the best of the best for childhood CHDs. Eventually they somehow, by miracle, raised the funds and he got the surgery but the surgery took a turn and Richie was placed on ECMO and once ur placed on ECMO, just for info purposes, if u don't make a turn for the better within I believe 96 hours after first being put on the machine, ur chances for recovery are very dim. Needless to say, I believe u can see where I'm going here and the absolute most heart wrenching decision was made by his insanely strong mama and dad. It's a story I will never ever forget, especially with how awful they had it in the last few months of his little life and having to desperately raise money for these very life threatening surgeries. \n\nThe US healthcare system is the biggest joke imo. I can't even imagine ppl being more worried about where their money is gonna come from over their choice to just do it and save a child's life and worry about money later. It's sickening to think of how many ppl in this country have died bc of this same reason. But anywho, I just wanted to point out this out bc of ur comment about money and whatnot. This is such an insanely difficult post to judge from OP all the way to dad, stepmom and bro. I do 100% agree with everything u said tho.", "My father is a physician and I have been sick my whole life. I even had to have 3 life saving surgeries this year. If someone comes into the ER they don't refuse care but to schedule surgery, even life saving surgery you have to provide insurance before you even see a surgeon. My uncle died because he needed heart surgery and didn't have insurance. He couldn't afford it and didn't want to ask for help. People absolutely die because they don't get the medicine and surgery they need. If the father and stepmom had no other way of getting the money and this was their last option then I think OP is the AH. Especially, if it wasn't an account in his name with the parents being the custodians. They couldn't let the stepbrother die and unfortunately we live in a country with a corrupt, for profit and in many ways on level with a third world medical system.  \n\nThis is a really unfortunate but all too common story in the US. \n\nUltimately I feel like we need more INFO on what the parents did to find the funds but if they had to use that money then OP is being too hard on his dad and should think about what he would have wanted them to do if the roles were reversed and he needed the surgeries to survive.", "I agree with most of what you've said, and I do think we're missing a lot of information on what was done otherwise to help pay for the medical expenses. When I said life or death, I meant that in a literal \"right now\" sense. The father of OP had the ability to save a college fund, which suggests he had all his other finances squared away.
