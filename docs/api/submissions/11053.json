We went yesterday partly for 16's birthday but also partly because we had family in town. I want to state that this is NOT 16's birthday dinner and she knows that. We have reservations for her favorite restaurant the day after her birthday. This restaurant has a thing where if you go within a week of your birthday you can spin a wheel for a prize. 18 had just spun the wheel a few months ago and got a cup and 13 has been talking about wanting one since then. \n\nTowards the end of the dinner, 13 asked the server if she could spin the wheel and said it was her birthday. The server asked for some kind of ID and she said \"I'm 13, I don't have an ID\". They agreed to let her spin the wheel. \n\nAfter the server left, 16 blew up at 13, calling her a bitch and saying she was about to ask if she could spin the wheel but forgot her learners permit at home but now she can't ask because they're not going to believe that excuse twice from one table. I tried telling her to calm down but she said \"fine but if we go in September (13's birthday), I'm taking her spin\". I told her she's being immature and that it's just a stupid wheel but she tried to walk out of the restaurant. \n\n13 won a free dessert and since it was her \"birthday\" we all sang happy birthday to her, except 16 who started crying and left the restaurant while we were singing. When we left the restaurant and found 16 still crying outside, my nephew and his wife took 16 out for dessert and didn't include any of the other kids. \n\nEven though 16 got her dessert, she's still mad at her little sister and is insisting that she should be grounded. My nephew and especially his wife are on her side and want to take her out again today without her sister. \n\nAITA for not grounding her or making her give up her dessert?", "created_utc": 1677514583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dfov6/aita_for_not_grounding_my_daughter_or_making_her/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Teenagers still put emphasis on their actual birthdays, even if the celebration is later or earlier. That you let this happen on 16\u2019s real birthday is despicable. Do you even like your daughter? \n\nWhen I turned 16, my dad and I were on airplanes for the whole day. I obviously knew that the day itself would not be that special. But I still thought my dad would be nice to me and wish me a happy birthday. Maybe sing the song to me. Instead, he told me to wake him up at midnight so he could be the first to wish me a happy birthday, but when I did so he yelled at me for waking him up and called me selfish. That made me cry - in the first minute of my birthday. The rest of the day got worse. I still remember that day 12 years later because of how painful my father\u2019s disregard was. He and I are LC now, even were NC for a few years. That\u2019s what you have to look forward to, OP, if you don\u2019t make things right with 16.", "YTA so you just allow your 13 year old to lie for her own benefit and didn't see an issue with that let alone that your other child had a birthday just a few days away and unable to spin the wheel when she was the one who had the right to do so.

Do better. \n\nAlso while you\u2019re at it, have a heart-to-heart with your older kids ask them if there were other times they felt you favourited the youngest, then make amends. You can repair this relationship, but as it stands currently, YTA.", "YTA. First- you enabled the 13 yo to be an entitled little shit. Second- you completely dismissed and invalidated the 16yo VERY valid feelings.

You're doing wrong by both of them.\n\nOne of them you're grilling that your favorite the younger sibling to the extent of REWARDING lying and stealing. Enabling would be bad enough, but nope, you took it 5 steps further and actually rewarded the abhorrent behavior. \n\nThe other you are raising to be an absolute dumpster fire. Because the rest of the world isn't going to put up with that kind of behavior. Unless you want your 13 year old to be miserable and have zero friends, you better step it up and start doing your job as a parent. \n\nDo better.", "YTA. Honestly, you\u2019re much worse than your 13 yo since you allowed her to lie, cheat, and steal. Great role model\u2026and I\u2019m glad your daughter has your nephew to back her up. They at least celebrated her birth since you could be bothered.", "You sang happy birthday to 13, after she lied to the server on 16s birthday (or close to) while 16 didn\u2019t get either of those things because it was (inappropriately) taken by 13. Yea, that\u2019s pretty weird and shitty of all of you. \n\nI\u2019m really put off by you encouraging 13s entitled, selfish, and rude behavior.

Not just stealing from the restaurant, who have a nice little giveaway run on the honor system for kids, but stealing your 16 year old's b-day treat, too.", "NTA \nI honestly can not see how there are some many YTA's and almost all of then come off as immature. Its a dumb wheel, during a regular dinner. It wasn't the 16yo birthday dinner, period.

If I had gotten a free dessert, I'd have shared it with my sister without hesitation because I love her and I don't want to enjoy something alone.

Your 16yo shouldn\u2019t have called her sister a derogatory term, but the 13yo shouldn\u2019t be allowed to lie with no consequence. Of course your 16yo was upset that the entire family sang happy birthday to her younger sister on *her* birthday. Why did everyone go along with the lie?", "Omg YTA!! I feel so sad for your 16 year old daughter.. when she goes no contact with you please come back to this post so you can see how horrible of a mother you are.", "Oh my god people here are way too upset about this, 13 got what she wanted, she was clever enough to do so ,so why not?\n\nI understand 16's anger, but since she got to get her own desert alone with nephew and aunt and they plan on doing it again, I don't get how would that require a grounding or to give up her desert\n\nBig NTA", "YTA \n\nI\u2019ve never wanted to tell someone to fuck off as much I want to say it to you..  You really don\u2019t see how your 16 year old could be hurt because someone else took all of her birthday fun?!?  She got her free spin taken, her dessert, and her birthday song ripped out of her hands.  What would happen if your 2 older daughters did this to your 13 year old?  Would it be ok, or would you be pissed that they stole 13 year olds moment?  If you would be mad at the older girls then you are clearly favoring 13.  13 is more than old enough to know to wait their turn.  And not to be so greedy and jealous of others good fortune.  Instead you taught her it\u2019s ok to steal and lie.  \n\nI hope your nephew and his wife take 16 back to this restaurant on her birthday so she gets a chance to spin the prize wheel.  And they take her without your 13 year old.  She would probably just try to steal a free spin again.", "YTA. You just let 13 get away with it in the moment. Since seeing things happen in the moment is hard to catch and save sibling drama, it\u2019s not always possible to diffuse. Trying to fix it after the fact with dessert after calling 16 immature is where it makes YTA.", "YTA.\nYou allowed your 13 year old to lie, then went along with the whole life to the point of singing Happy Birthday when you KNEW it wasn't her birthday?!?!? And you did this in front of the child whose birthday it actually (pretty much) was?!?\n\nYTA for spoiling your younger daughter, raising an entitled brat, and encouraging her to lie. Why WOULDN'T you punish your child for lying for personal gain??", "YTA for allowing 13 to cheat, lie and essentially steal from the restaurant. What horrible behavior to \u201ccelebrate\u201d in your child. And during 16s birthday week too?!", "YTA.  You are so lucky that I wasn\u2019t sitting at that table. I would have blown the whistle on that bullshit ***hard.***   \nI would have embarrassed the fuck out of you in front of the entire restaurant. If you\u2019re even capable of being embarrassed.

I'm sad for your kids that you don't even know why.", "INFO: Why do you dislike your 16-year-old?\n\nEDIT: YTA and I\u2019m done arguing with you.", "YTA. I\u2019m guessing 16 years old daughter\u2019s happiest years were between 0 to 3.", "What a way to see February out and March in with AITA for being a crappy parent?\n\nTo answer your question, YTA. Just admit that you have favorites (the 13 yo) and move on. Your nephew and wife see through your BS. Your 16 year old sees through your BS. You're the only one who either doesn't see it, or doesn't want to admit that they are indeed, a crap parent. \n\nYou're creating a divide between you and your eldest and an entitled monster of a brat in your youngest. When the eldest turns 18, bounces and has nothing to do with you, you'll have no one to blame but yourself.", "YTA.  That action not only demonstrated to 13 that she can get what she wants by lying, but you also made 16 feel like she and her milestone birthday doesn't matter to her family.\n\nMy parents had three kids with birthdays in a single eight day stretch, each one four days apart.  Because my mother was notoriously cheap, she'd buy one sheet cake for all the birthdays, which were celebrated on the mid-point date... and half the time, the name of the child whose birthday was the unfortunate middle date, would be omitted or misspelled.\n\nYou need to apologize to 16, and reinforce for 13 that lying is not an acceptable means to get what you want.", "YTA. \n\n16 is right, the 13 yr old is a little entitled b-tch. And you\u2019re worse for enabling the little brat. When 16 is 18 andout of the house you really think she\u2019ll keep in touch? Nope. You just started the fire to burn down that bridge, and frankly idk if there\u2019s anything that could extinguish it. \n\nYou could\u2019ve used that situation as a teaching moment for the 13 to learn that she can\u2019t just do that. But no, you instead went along with the lie. Yes, it\u2019s just a free dessert but that\u2019s not what matters. What matters here is you showed the teen she can get her way and you showed 16 who the golden child is.", "YTA!!!!!! its not her birthday!!!!!1 for goodness sake are you stupid ?", "YTA, this makes it seem like you care more for the 13 year old than the 16 year old.  You should have spoken up when your 13 yo daughter asked and said something like your birthday is a big away yet, let\u2019s wait until it\u2019s closer to your birthday.   Why are you rewarding your daughter who told a lie?", "YTA. Why didn't a parent call the 13yo out for lying and tell the server the truth? Instead you acted like there was nothing to do but go along with it. Such weird behavior.", "YTA.  Let's do a simple role reversal here.  Same scenario but say the 16 year old did this to your 13 year old.\n\nWould you be fine with that, would you not punish the 16 year old for stealing the 13 year olds prize, and getting the happy birthday song and wishes.  \n\nI imagine you'd be furious to see that happen to the golden child.", "YTA\n\nWhy would you condone your child lying? \n\nThis is absolutely absurd. You condone flat out bold faced lies to business to get things AND manage to screw over the actual birthday child.", "YTA. So we know who the golden child is.", "YTA is this a fucking joke lady?", "YTA what you should have done was correct the 13yo & tell the server it\u2019s actually the 16yo with the birthday next week. You showed blatant favoritism.", "So now your 13 year old thinks it\u2019s okay to lie to get something. Cool. YTA", "So you let the 13 yo lie? Why? I\u2019d be pissed too. YTA", "YTA. \n\nI personally don\u2019t see grounding as a very helpful form of discipline in most cases, but however you choose to respond to this situation, I\u2019d encourage you to really think about the dynamic between your daughters.\n\nYour 16-year-old\u2019s emotional response to this situation implies that this goes a lot deeper than the \u201cstupid wheel\u201d and that this may be the latest in a series of instances where you have allowed your youngest daughter to get away with things (lying, thoughtlessness, self-centred behaviour) at the expense of your older daughter\u2019s feelings. Just food for thought.", "YTA\n\nYour favoritism is showing. It's 16's birthday. She should get a chance at the wheel without having to be a liar. It's something unique and a little special.

You said in the first full paragraph that this was partially for the 16yo's birthday. Not fully but partially. And this wheel thing obviously is fun and part of your family tradition.
