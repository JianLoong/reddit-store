You haven\u2019t worked in 8 years. It\u2019s going to be hard to find a job and get the kids in day care of find a sitter. Plus he doesn\u2019t want you to leave them with anyone else. This is going to be some major changes for your youngest that has special needs.\n\nSo before you start to walk away you need a game plan. I get your done but honestly simply walking away isn\u2019t logical right now. I am in the US so what I am about to tell you might not apply to your country. \n\nFirst thing you need to do is make a game plan and this escape plan isn\u2019t something that can happen over night.\n\n1- the first thing you need to do is document everything. Every time he is verbally abusive. Every time he refuses to help with the kids document it. Time date and what happen. Make sure this book is hidden. Every dr appointment, anything for school document it.\n\n2- start saving money. Have it hidden. Anything. If you find a 5 in the washer save it. When you go to the grocery store get cash back.  Not a lot. $10 here$20 there. Save it hide it.\n\n3-make copies of social security cards, driver\u2019s license, birth certificate (even his). Hide this also. Any checking or retirement accounts copy those also. After 10 years most states they have to split those 50/50. Any deeds to vehicles,property that was acquired during the marriage copy those\nalso. Copy your tax documents each year. This shows his proof of income. You don\u2019t need every page just the first page!\n\n4- if you can rent a storage unit. Do that. Go to the post office preferably in a need by town. Rent a post office box. Have things come to that address. If you don\u2019t have a credit card in just your name yet one. Use it pay it straight off. But not out of your checking account do money orders. Start slowly taking stuff from the house. A couple towels, anything you don\u2019t want damaged, anything valuable., pack bags for the kids incase you have to leave suddenly. Extra blankets. You get the idea. Slowly move stuff that he won\u2019t notice but you want to keep. Also want to add. When you go to the grocery store. By a couple cans extra of soup. Non perishable items your kids will. Eat when you get closer to leaving by snacks store in a tote. Not a lot. Don\u2019t drive your grocery budget up by more than$40. Store the snacks in a tote with lid.  \n\n5- go to a different bank then he uses. Preferably in a different town open a checking account in your name. Keep the money your saving there.\n\n6- start letting your kids stay with someone you trust occasionally. Get them use to this. Also start visiting daycares for your kids or looking for child care.\n\n7- now it\u2019s time to look for a job to support yourself. There are a lot of work from home companies. If you can find one that doesn\u2019t have a lot of demands that be awesome.  \n\n8- after you have established credit usually takes 6 months if you have none. And you have safed I would shoot for $3000 of you can start low key looking for an apartment. Find one rent it. \n\n9- after you have rented your apartment go to the courthouse file for custody of your kids then leave.\n\n\nAfter all these things are done then run. \n\nHowever if it gets abusive get out. But as long as you and the kids are not endanger then make a game plan. Does it suck to have to wait a few months yes but at least you have a way out with out having nothing and being homeless.\n\n\n\nEdit to add:\n\nI have been a stay at home for 30+years. I have not worked. I raised kids. Ran a house. I love and trust my husband 100 percent he has never given me a reason to not trust him.\n\nBut as the old saying goes momma didn\u2019t raise a fool. As wife\u2019s we give up our financial freedom to take care of our family. I have seen to many woman  be left with nothing and then having to fight for custody for the kids they took care of. So I always knew I would have a safty net.\n\nI always have money saved and hid. I have important documents saved and hid with that money. I have a credit card in just my name. I use it then pay it off. Hubby doesn\u2019t check accounts.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong we get in a tight spot then I won\u2019t let us struggle. I dip into my emergency fund. If hubby asks he knows I have money saved for vacations, and Christmas. He just never knows where it\u2019s stashed and how much is stashed. Always have a plan laddies. No matter how amazing your hubby is. Affairs happen. Not working for 20 years hurts us.", "NTA.  However, you do need to make a change here.  Get a job and put the children in daycare.  So what if it takes all of your take home pay.

He helped more but I got a part- job so he didn't have a choice.\n\nYes. I chose to work swing shift (3-4-5pm to 9-10-11pm), as a server, at a local restaurant. I scheduled all Dr. & dentist appointments after 3pm. He washed all laundry except mine. He was responsible for pick ups/drop offs on days I worked. He had to cook dinner. He learned how to grocery shop. \n\nSometimes when I was cut early I'd go shopping or hang out with friends. A LOT changed. It made him respectful of the time I spent doing for our family.\n\nMy only slight regret is that my kids ate take-out more often than I would've liked. I'm old now. One's graduated college and the other will soon enter. We're still together because he decided to change his ways and I shined up my spine and said to myself No Fucking More. If he didn't change his 1950s ways I'd be long gone by now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-", "NTA.

Because if we didn\u2019t do what we do our spouses would be paying half.\n\n\nBut the fact you think that stay at home moms don\u2019t do anything to help support our family\u2019s or we are lazy is really degrading. Especially to the ones that work out asses off for her spouses and kids.", "lol", "I suggest you read the us marriage laws. All 52 states divide marital property and income equally no matter who works. Unless there is a prenup.\n\nBecause no it\u2019s not his money. If I can\u2019t have a emergency stash because it\u2019s stealing then neither can he. BECAUSE ITS NOT JUST HIS MONEY!ITS HALF MINE. THE house is half mine. His retirement plan is half mine!  Because that how each state see marital assets. \n\n\nBut actually I have an amazing marriage. I have been married 25+ years. My husband doesn\u2019t care what money I have saved no more than I care what he has saved. And oh I am a stay at home mom that does not work.  But he still doesn\u2019t care what I money I have saved or what I spend. \n\nAnd here is the real kicker. When our kids where little even though he worked6 days a week 10-12 hours a day. He wanted to be with his kids. He wanted to help. Because that\u2019s how real men are!\n\nReal men don\u2019t use thier wives as bang, maid, cooks and nanny\u2019s.", "Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I think.  People always tell you who they are, but emotions often cause the other person to ignore the warning signs. \n\nEven in this instance; the guy never helped out and she kept having kids with him\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Ya it's not a real job. Ask a single moms who work what they think about stay at home moms who complain. OP can't even wake up in the morning twice a week without threatening divorce. Saving your own money is okay but secretly stashing away money that someone else worked for is shady. Either have communication or get a real part time job that pays you money but don't steal", "This is why guys should never marry bum females with no job. Turns them into entitled losers with no drive completely dependent on men.  You need to realize that your husband worked way harder than you and did far more for the family than you ever did and his sacrifice deserves far more appreciation than you deserve as a stay at home mom. Imo", "So what warning signs would she have seen?", "Let me say this a little louder because you don\u2019t seem to understand! \n\nShe works so! She takes care of thier kids! She is the one that cooks! She is the one that does all the cleaning! They are his kids too! He can help on his days off!\n\nIn most states it\u2019s called marital money for a reason. If she divorce him now guess what he have to share half. He would have to pay childsupport! Hell she could probably take the house! There is a reason these laws exists. But to get what she is entitled too it takes money to get a lawyer!\n\nAlso if you ask a single mom that just got out of an abusive situation or a single mom who\u2019s ex cheated on her she probably tell you she wished she done what i had sugested!\n\nAgain she can\u2019t steal money that is suppose to be half hers! When her husband wanted her to be a stay at home mom he agreed to support her. Meaning she gets so much money to run her household. Buy stuff for herself.", "Dude I have 3 college degrees. I choose not to work to take care of my husband parents.\nSo he doesn\u2019t have to worry about them.\n\nMy husband would tell you different. He would tell you he would have lost his ever loving mind to have to take our kids to school, practice, to games. He would tell you that there is no way he could be at his parents peck and call like I am.\n\nHe would tell you that he could not do his job and have the career he has if it wasn\u2019t for me sacrificing my career to stay at home. He would tell you I am the one that makes everything happen from dinner, to laying his clothes out at night, to getting up 30 minutes before he does every morning to make him his coffee and breakfast so he can sleep more.\n\nI am the first one up every morning to the last one going to bed! I am the one who makes his plate every evening. To laying out his medicine in the mornings. I am the one that does all of his running. \nJust so he can focus on what he needs to do at work to be where he is at now.", "She's a welfare bum complaining about the man who actually works. There is no abuse. She's just mad he asked her to wake up twice a week early. Unfortunately laws allow females to take half the money that's why 98 out of the 100 richest women got their money through divorce. The entitlement is insane and it's unfortunate people have to support these lazy people who would otherwise have nothing based on their effort", "I didn't ask for your life story and I don't see why you desperately want to make this about you and proving yourself to online strangers. Respectfully I don't care. If you wake up early to do things for him and get everything done and aren't on government assistance then that changes the situation from yours and OPs. Not all stay at home moms are the same and you're feeling personally attacked as if this is your situation and as if OP is an exact replica of yourself"]}
