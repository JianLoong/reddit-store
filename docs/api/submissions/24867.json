That's a lot of things. Sam is 27. If one of the reasons that he can't pay rent is that he isn't making smart financial choices than you kicking out a 20 yr old who you (1) agreed could live in the apartment and (2) is taking this year off school because of health reasons isn't reasonable. (May it take more than a year maybe. It sounds like you don't know a lot about what's going on with her health.)\n\nIt would be understandable to some degree if things happened and Sam found himself in this situation but if Sam and his partner haven't been living within their means- they're the thing that happened to them.  And you letting Sam and his partner move into to your place for discounted rent isn't going to help them.\n\nGiven that you don't seem to know what is going on with Anne medically, it's hard to say whether her desire to not have random roommates right now is reasonable. It may be really reasonable depending on her medical issues.\n\nI get it- Sam's your nephew and you want to help him but it isn't clear how (1) this would help him and (2) why Sam can't wait until at least Anne's agreed upon year is up.\n\nYTA", "So you want to kick out someone who is living for free to bring in someone else who is living for free?\n\nYTA.

She was taking one year off, she'd be able to live at your place, without rent, for that period of time.  \n\nPulling the rug out from under her, only partway during the year, is AH.  You can be clear that it is only a one-year promise, not an open ended one.  It also doesn't sound as if Sam and his partner would be able to pay rent either.  Which makes \"she doesn't pay rent\" not much of an argument for choosing Sam over her. \n\nBut Sam and his partner are significantly older than Anne.  They have more options for pulling things together. And as a couple, they have the resources of two people to support their household, rather than just one person. \n\nTalk to Anne about what her plans are for the rest of the year, and after this year, remind her that the option isn't open-ended, but if you promised her a year, it doesn't sound as if she's done anything to justify you breaking that promise.  It just sounds as if you like the idea of helping your nephew more than your niece.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to offer that Anne can stay rent-free but you and your wife own the apartment and have a right to make arrangements with the property you own. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA exactly, but it sounds like there\u2019s some additional dynamics in play and you\u2019d be better off to figure out all of them before making a big change. It sounds like Anne has been fine there\u2026 is this about the rent? Is it because she\u2019s not taking steps forward? You need to figure that out because something is informing your decision that hasn\u2019t been said (at least not here)", "YTA.

I still dont understand why they can't share if they are not paying rent. it sounds that Anne needs to find a new place? or a job and pay rent?", "YTA", "YTA. It becomes clear when reading your comments. \nAt face value, you word it to make it seem like nieve and nephew are in the same situation but they\u2019re not. Your niece is in this situation because she\u2019s sick. Your nephew doesn\u2019t know how to manage his money and was living out of his means. \n\nYour niece is sick and doesn\u2019t want to move back to her parents because she would have to find new doctors. Depending on the illness, the waitlist for a specialist can be six months to a year. You don\u2019t outright say it but it\u2019s implied that everything she is asking for is because she is sick. She had to leave school (you even state she\u2019s on leave - as in medical leave. She didn\u2019t fully drop out), can only work a limited amount of hours, and doesn\u2019t want to share because she needs sleep and a peaceful environment so she can recover (if this is even an illness she can recover from. She could need the year to find her new normal). \n\nYour nephew\u2019s situation isn\u2019t great either but it seems far more temporary. He\u2019s still earning money. Yes it\u2019s less than before but his fix is to adjust his budget and apply for jobs with a pay increase. You don\u2019t mention if his spouse is working but if not they can start working to increase the household funds. They could also move with your brother to save money. Basically, Sam has more options especially since it\u2019s both him and his spouse. \n\nYou promised your niece a year. You are assuming she won\u2019t go back to school but that might not be the case. It\u2019s only been a few months so it is difficult to see what kind of progress her health has made. When a student returns from medical leave, they typically need their doctors clearance. Many schools won\u2019t even accept this until a few months before registration for the semester she\u2019s returning for opens. Each school has their own requirements but since she picked doctors near her university, it\u2019s likely that she plans to return and it\u2019ll be difficult if she has to find new ones now because she will have to rejoin her current doctor\u2019s waitlists when she returns to school which will affect her care. The stress from you kicking her out is also probable affecting her ability to heal. \n\nNo one expects you to maintain this arrangement indefinitely. In a few months, if there\u2019s no improvement in her health, your niece will have to start looking to move home and she can join waitlists for doctors in her parents area so she\u2019ll be able to see them by the time the year is up. But for right now you made a commitment and by going back on it you\u2019re causing problems for your wife\u2019s family and probably a rift in your marriage.", "YTA.  You told your niece she could stay there without charging her rent.  You didn't place any conditions on her stay.  You didn't have her sign a lease.  Now you are arbitrary kicking her out for no reason except you want to let someone else stay there.", "NTA. She chose to drop out and doesn't sound like she's making any active plans for her future. You never promised to house her indefinitely.

Sam and his partner need the help, although this should also be temporary.", "NTA. Anne can either learn to share even if it's inconvenient for her, or find other accommodations.

What is she doing when she\u2019s on her leave? Is she unwell in any way?

It really is that simple. NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nIf she had agreed to share, then she could have stayed, possibly (and the issue she brings up that she would rather not share with 'people she doesnt know' doesnt hold water, as those 'people' are part of your family, just as she is)\n\nBut the fact that you allowed her to live there while in school was really generous (especially since you arent charging rent and apparently she also doesnt pay utilities that much) -- but since she now isnt in school, negates her need to live there. \n\nIt absolutely is fair -- she wants to have her cake and eat it too, and get a freebie on you, whereas your nephew is in dire straits.", "NTA \n\nBeggars can\u2019t be choosers.

A deadline?", "Nta it\u2019s sound like you have given her 6 months. You didn\u2019t promise for ever.

This really isn\u2019t on her she\u2019s not paying rent she\u2019s not going to school so if she doesn\u2019t want to share then get her own place pay her own bills", "Sounds like you're giving Anne plenty of time to find something else, so NTA. \n\nHaving a place to stay rent-free for as long as she has is an amazing generous gift. While I don't hold it against her for not wanting to give it up, she ought to be grateful for having it as long as she did. \n\nYour wife has a really skewed sense of fairness - *her* niece is entitled to free rent as long as she wants it, but *your* nephew can go kick rocks? Nope. Put a full stop to that.", "NTA. \n\nIs this a one or two bedroom apartment?  I would assume that you have it as an investment and that it's meant to generate money.

The moral of this story is Beggars Can't Be Choosers.  The problems that Anne and Sam are going through are not your problems.  They are theirs and theirs alone.

They are strangers.\n\nI think Anne is actually ill due to OP\u2019s comment that she needs her rest and needs to be near her doctor\u2019s and the hospital.\n\nSam actually works but can\u2019t afford his \u201cextravagant\u201d life style and rent.\n\nI\u2019m with OP\u2019s wife and Anne on this one.", "OP made it his responsibility, though.", "Except it is, for the duration of the year. He told her she could stay for the year.", "Depends on the conditions you set when she moved in, but I\u2019d want to know what her plans are. If she\u2019s using her savings for a gap year and is going to re enroll, that\u2019s her choice and she doesn\u2019t deserve to lose her place. \n\nIf she\u2019s showing signs of failure to launch, it\u2019s time to send her back to mom!\n\nI completely get your desire to help your nephew. He sounds like he needs it. But if the apartment was promised to niece for a year while she sorts her life out, then it\u2019s favouring one family member over another.", "Except it is his and his WIFE'S apartment (even if solely in his name, he is married). He made a unilateral decision contrary to what his wife said. S no, I don't think it's as cut and dry as you are making it.", "They are both OPs family. She made a sensible offer for both sides of family to share. One side rejected it.", "Unfortunately a family crisis trumps a year off school.", "Unfortunately though there is a family crisis.  It trumps a the previous request.", "I just read through OP\u2019s comments.  It sounds like (but I\u2019m not 100% sure)\n\nAnne has a medical issue and needs to be near her doctors.\n\nSam and his wife have led an extravagant life style that they can no longer afford.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that changes your views.  But it cements mine.  OP is the TA", "In my eyes it\u2019s equal for OP.  \n\nAnne - can afford some rent but not all\n\nSam - can afford some rent but not all\n\nDisplacing Sam because he\u2019s older and married does not trump displacing Anne because she\u2019s younger.", "Why? What's the crisis? OP said in the comment that his nephew is used to a more extravagant lifestyle and that's why he'd be more comfortable there. So it sounds like the crisis is the nephew spending money he doesn't have. That isn't a crisis.", "Anne refused to share the apartment as an option this is on her for being unwilling to share", "Anne can go home and have a place to love.\n\nSam cannot.", "I haven't read the comments yet."]}
