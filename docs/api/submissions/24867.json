That's a lot of things. Sam is 27. If one of the reasons that he can't pay rent is that he isn't making smart financial choices than you kicking out a 20 yr old who you (1) agreed could live in the apartment and (2) is taking this year off school because of health reasons isn't reasonable. (May it take more than a year maybe. It sounds like you don't know a lot about what's going on with her health.)\n\nIt would be understandable to some degree if things happened and Sam found himself in this situation but if Sam and his partner haven't been living within their means- they're the thing that happened to them.  And you letting Sam and his partner move into to your place for discounted rent isn't going to help them.\n\nGiven that you don't seem to know what is going on with Anne medically, it's hard to say whether her desire to not have random roommates right now is reasonable. It may be really reasonable depending on her medical issues.\n\nI get it- Sam's your nephew and you want to help him but it isn't clear how (1) this would help him and (2) why Sam can't wait until at least Anne's agreed upon year is up.\n\nYTA", "So you want to kick out someone who is living for free to bring in someone else who is living for free?\n\nYTA.

She was taking one year off, she'd be able to live at your place, without rent, for that period of time.  \n\nPulling the rug out from under her, only partway during the year, is AH.  You can be clear that it is only a one-year promise, not an open ended one.  It also doesn't sound as if Sam and his partner would be able to pay rent either.  Which makes \"she doesn't pay rent\" not much of an argument for choosing Sam over her. \n\nBut Sam and his partner are significantly older than Anne.  They have more options for pulling things together. And as a couple, they have the resources of two people to support their household, rather than just one person. \n\nTalk to Anne about what her plans are for the rest of the year, and after this year, remind her that the option isn't open-ended, but if you promised her a year, it doesn't sound as if she's done anything to justify you breaking that promise.  It just sounds as if you like the idea of helping your nephew more than your niece.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to offer that Anne can stay rent-free but you and your wife own the apartment and have a right to make arrangements with the property you own. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA exactly, but it sounds like there\u2019s some additional dynamics in play and you\u2019d be better off to figure out all of them before making a big change. It sounds like Anne has been fine there\u2026 is this about the rent? Is it because she\u2019s not taking steps forward? You need to figure that out because something is informing your decision that hasn\u2019t been said (at least not here)", "YTA. You and your wife discussed and then you did the exact opposite of what she wanted. Soon you will be looking for a place after the divorce.", "INFO: Since your niece isn't attending college currently, is there any reason she can't move back in with your SIL?

I still dont understand why they can't share if they are not paying rent. it sounds that Anne needs to find a new place? or a job and pay rent?\n\nEDIT yeah i think after all the comments, i have a clearer picture why she is in the  apartment. I take it back!!!", "YTA", "YTA. It becomes clear when reading your comments. \nAt face value, you word it to make it seem like nieve and nephew are in the same situation but they\u2019re not. Your niece is in this situation because she\u2019s sick. Your nephew doesn\u2019t know how to manage his money and was living out of his means. \n\nYour niece is sick and doesn\u2019t want to move back to her parents because she would have to find new doctors. Depending on the illness, the waitlist for a specialist can be six months to a year. You don\u2019t outright say it but it\u2019s implied that everything she is asking for is because she is sick. She had to leave school (you even state she\u2019s on leave - as in medical leave. She didn\u2019t fully drop out), can only work a limited amount of hours, and doesn\u2019t want to share because she needs sleep and a peaceful environment so she can recover (if this is even an illness she can recover from. She could need the year to find her new normal). \n\nYour nephew\u2019s situation isn\u2019t great either but it seems far more temporary. He\u2019s still earning money. Yes it\u2019s less than before but his fix is to adjust his budget and apply for jobs with a pay increase. You don\u2019t mention if his spouse is working but if not they can start working to increase the household funds. They could also move with your brother to save money. Basically, Sam has more options especially since it\u2019s both him and his spouse. \n\nYou promised your niece a year. You are assuming she won\u2019t go back to school but that might not be the case. It\u2019s only been a few months so it is difficult to see what kind of progress her health has made. When a student returns from medical leave, they typically need their doctors clearance. Many schools won\u2019t even accept this until a few months before registration for the semester she\u2019s returning for opens. Each school has their own requirements but since she picked doctors near her university, it\u2019s likely that she plans to return and it\u2019ll be difficult if she has to find new ones now because she will have to rejoin her current doctor\u2019s waitlists when she returns to school which will affect her care. The stress from you kicking her out is also probable affecting her ability to heal. \n\nNo one expects you to maintain this arrangement indefinitely. In a few months, if there\u2019s no improvement in her health, your niece will have to start looking to move home and she can join waitlists for doctors in her parents area so she\u2019ll be able to see them by the time the year is up. But for right now you made a commitment and by going back on it you\u2019re causing problems for your wife\u2019s family and probably a rift in your marriage.", "YTA.  You told your niece she could stay there without charging her rent.  You didn't place any conditions on her stay.  You didn't have her sign a lease.  Now you are arbitrary kicking her out for no reason except you want to let someone else stay there.", "NTA. She chose to drop out and doesn't sound like she's making any active plans for her future. You never promised to house her indefinitely.

Sam and his partner need the help, although this should also be temporary.", "NTA. Anne can either learn to share even if it's inconvenient for her, or find other accommodations.

It really is that simple. NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nIf she had agreed to share, then she could have stayed, possibly (and the issue she brings up that she would rather not share with 'people she doesnt know' doesnt hold water, as those 'people' are part of your family, just as she is)\n\nBut the fact that you allowed her to live there while in school was really generous (especially since you arent charging rent and apparently she also doesnt pay utilities that much) -- but since she now isnt in school, negates her need to live there. \n\nIt absolutely is fair -- she wants to have her cake and eat it too, and get a freebie on you, whereas your nephew is in dire straits.", "~~NTA~~ \n\nBeggars can\u2019t be choosers.

This really isn\u2019t on her she\u2019s not paying rent she\u2019s not going to school so if she doesn\u2019t want to share then get her own place pay her own bills", "Sounds like you're giving Anne plenty of time to find something else, so NTA. \n\nHaving a place to stay rent-free for as long as she has is an amazing generous gift. While I don't hold it against her for not wanting to give it up, she ought to be grateful for having it as long as she did. \n\nYour wife has a really skewed sense of fairness - *her* niece is entitled to free rent as long as she wants it, but *your* nephew can go kick rocks? Nope. Put a full stop to that.", "NTA. \n\nIs this a one or two bedroom apartment?  I would assume that you have it as an investment and that it's meant to generate money.

If it can accommodate both parties then I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.  If Anne isn't comfortable with living with other people while living RENT FREE, then she can kick rocks.  The moral of this story is Beggars Can't Be Choosers.  The problems that Anne and Sam are going through are not your problems.  They are theirs and theirs alone.
