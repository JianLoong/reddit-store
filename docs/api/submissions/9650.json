Not wearing weather appropriate covering (coats), observed outside for (X) continuous hours on these dates, not observed eating lunch or food or going into the house to eat, on neighbors' property scratching cars, playing with hoops, throwing rocks at cars, refusing to get out of the street which cars pass, cussing at people, ding-donging door bells.....etc. Best to you.

That's where they generally belong.  Stop trying to parent them -- they aren't your kids.  That said, if they are damaging your property or your neighbors property, trespassing, etc, you should call social services (or the police).

It seems like she just isn't willing to engage with her kids directly more than absolutely necessary, or deal with parenting them at all.\n\nAnd the thing is, while this could mean that she's just an AH, it also points to the possibility that she may be overwhelmed or depressed, and unable to cope with having the kids in the house and has just opted out of parenting completely, in which case calling CPS is actually doing a favour not only to the kids but to her - they can provide resources to help. \n\nPlease do call CPS. This mother may be desperately in need of help. You are definitely NTA.", "We had 3 boys in my neighborhood in Baltimore like this all the neighborhood moms were concerned. We helped them by, if they had no coats/hats/gloves on and it was cold one of us moms would find no longer used coats from our kids and make sure they were good. We would do lunch and breakfast and snacks for them like we did our own kids. We all did this because we tried to talk to the mother and she just punished the 8 year old (as he was responsible for his siblings) and gave the two smaller kids money to go get candy at the store. Calling CPS was not the best idea because a lot of children are better off with neglect than physical and sexual abuse which occurs often when CPS gets involved and rehomes/fosters kids in our area. Several of the moms in our group had been a child to get rehomed/fostered by CPS and it was way worse than what was happening in their homes.", "NTA.  Trust your gut.  Call CPS.  It's never wrong to try to protect little kids.  And you'll never forgive yourself if this turns into one of these \"well the neighbors knew, everyone knew, but nobody did anything to save the kids\" situations.  Pick up the phone.", "When we were kids we were kicked out of the house and told not to come in until the street lights come on.There are a lot of people that seem to have CPS (an alleged child trafficking organization) on speed dial and are itching to put other people's kids in the \"system\". That's scary. Kids are always gonna be little shits and unless mom is getting high, what can you do? Call CPS to check and see if mom is using, and if they're satisfied, she's not, YTA.", "Nta however this could be a very landline filled conversation with your neighbor. \n\nThat being said if you are genuinely concerned I\u2019d definitely say something.", "I don't think the acted on this issue yes....it is WIBTA\n\nWhoops - Just read OPs edit -- She will call today!", "They do go to school as far as I know; but once they\u2019re home, they\u2019re outside.", "Yes, she is hesitant to call CPS only because neither of us is sure that the kids are telling the truth about being kicked out and just happen to be troublemakers that like being outside. That is the only reason I haven\u2019t called yet.", " This isn't about them being outside, though. It's about them being outside while not dressed properly for the weather, possibly not even being allowed back in for mealtimes, and behaving like feral animals towards other people and their property. And the mother telling them she's doing it because she \"needs alone time\" - not what our mothers did, which was throw us out because the fresh air was good for us. This isn't about being nosy neighbours, OP has genuine concerns. Being concerned about kids who aren't being properly cared for isn't \"parenting them\".", "Would you mind pointing out where I parented them, I\u2019m just curious as to what you\u2019re referring to.", "Yeah as a nineties kid, mum would kick us all out in the morning and tell us to be back for dinner. We got up to all sorts of shit. Not that Im advocating being a lazy parent to feral kids, it was just fairly normal back then.\n\nDamaging property crosses a line though, and the mother is asking for a CPS visit slamming doors in people's faces like that.", "To be clear though OP doesn't know about what abuse may be happening outside of the obvious neglect.", "I see by your edit you've made a decision, but then I see this comment, so I feel like you might be unsure, still.\n\nHere's the thing. I've been on all sides of this issue. When I was a child, someone should have called, and no one ever did.\n\nI'm a former teacher who has had to make a few calls in the course of my job.\n\nAnd I've called twice outside of the school system, when something seemed just... really dangerous and wrong. Once it turned out to be a behavioral issue the parents weren't aware of, and nothing happened with those parents. Once it was... well, a damned good thing I called.\n\nI have a child of my own, and have had an overzealous neighbor call on me. (My child has autism, and as a toddler/preschooler screamed like all the hounds of hell were descending)\n\nIt was annoying. I didn't like having some stranger in my house questioning my parenting decisions, thinking I might be some monster hurting a 4 year old. But... because nothing was actually going on, nothing happened. And other than a very brief temporary annoyance, it wasn't a big deal.\n\nAnd afterward I was able to be grateful that someone cared enough to call. Because if you call and your wrong, the biggest issue is someone gets annoyed. And if you *don't* call and you're wrong, then... some child could be seriously hurt/traumatized/worse.\n\nThat doesn't mean you should call for every petty little thing. But you've seen that this parent is unconcerned with her children's whereabouts (else she wouldn't have slammed the door when someone let her know they weren't home). The children have said it's a problem. There are obvious behavior problems. You've described a 4 year old playing in the streets, with no concern for traffic, which is dangerous. The lack of winter-gear I wouldn't see as a big thing on its own, because kids run hotter than parents believe, usually, but... it's part of a pattern. \n\nAny one or two of these things *could be* okay and just a style of parenting you or I might not follow. But it's a pattern. And the outcomes for each decision are drastically different in terms of damage done.\n\nAlways err on the side of the child.", "You could always call the police to perform a welfare check and explain that they\u2019re out in the cold without appropriate clothing and the kids claim their mother kicks them out and won\u2019t let them inside. Chances are they will show up and speak to the mother. If they find anything alarming, they will escalate to CPS.", "A mandated reporter provides factual statements (think who, what, where, duration), observations and related supportive details. Mandated reporters are not trained to evaluate if behavior and circumstances are neglect.  You report, CPS decides if it a case and if so they will follow up. I don't want u/chaenorrhinum's statement about the teacher to impact your decision. \n\nWhen you call, state facts. If the kids stated something to you then convey what they said. You've observed them being outside in-climate weather daily since (date) without proper coats (?), they are outside continuously for 4 (?) hours and not observed going inside for lunch. This is an example of how to be concise. Adjust this and add to it. Ask CPS if this will be a case and can they give you the case number.  Technically, the more people who call and convey their experience, the better.", "Even if they aren't telling the truth, it doesn't seem like she's putting any effort to caring that they are outside and not appropriately dressed. CPS goal isn't  to separate the family, there aren't the resources to separate everyone...but they can help the mom find supports.", "Ultimately, CPS is there to determine if the kids are telling the truth. If you stick to what you have observed (the kids are outside for long stretches of time, not dressed for the weather) and what the kids report (they told me they get kicked out of the house for the day every morning) then worst case scenario is that CPS closes the investigation without interfering.\n\nDepending on how overworked the department is, they might also be able to connect the family to some early intervention services. It sounds like three boys without an adult male role model in their life, which is perfect for a referral to Big Brothers, or a Boys and Girls Club, or whatever is available in your area.", "You should be able to remain anonymous if you do call Social services. But child services workers would rather you call them,  than having the kids end up hurt & without supervision. I'd say call them.", "Don\u2019t worry the kids will be separated, plus the foster system is horrible so they have a high chance of being abused etc. so you won\u2019t be brightened by those troublemakers", "The FACT is that the kids said their mom does this.", "Thank you, helped.", "Yes, good clarification.", "I'm glad. This experience can feel unsettling. If you are up to it, update the post.", "NTA call social services now.", "You seem to be ignoring the shit the kids are doing that\u2019s unsafe or affects other people", "You're right, I'm wrong. She should lose her kids for all their trauma causing ding dong ditching."]}
