But it's your party and you get to invite and not invite who you want.\n\nI once made some similar choices to your SIL and when my shitty ex and I got back together, I didn't want the embarrassment of introducing him to my family again after they knew what happened. He and I broke up for the second time over exactly that issue. I don't even necessarily believe \"once a theif always a theif,\" but YOU don't have a relationship with this man that has shown you otherwise. Your SIL is an adult and she should have enough logic to see why other people would be uncomfortable with him. It's going to hurt your relationship with her, but she's making the choice to be with him and she is choosing to suffer those consequences.", "NTA.

If SIL cant respect your boundaries, thats her choice to not be invited with her thief boyfriend to peoples places.", "NTA.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable that you wouldn't want someone with sticky fingers in your home. SIL needs to get over herself and understand that this aspect of her man will make others VERY uncomfortable and not okay with trusting him in their home.\n\nShe doesn't have to like it.

My friend absolutely forbid the thief from entering her home for the holidays. She said it\u2019s her home and only wants people who she can trust in it. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly fine to forbid a thief from entering your home.
