Causing her to get a write up?", "selftext": "Most waitress jobs have an app so you can see your shifts and pick up extra ones. You can see who else is working what shifts and can also send messages on this app: this is important for later.\r\n\r\n So at my last job, I allowed others to text my number so they can ask me to pick up shifts. This became ANNOYING because I was the first person they ask and it was anyways \u201can emergency\u201d. They would start using my number for personal conversations and it sometimes got messy because someone would vent to me and then try to continue the conversation in the workplace, causing drama to follow.\r\nSo now at my new job, I\u2019ve decided to keep my work and personal life separate. And I would only communicate through the app. Now keep in mind I\u2019m still really new to the place (I\u2019ve barely been there a month) and I\u2019ve already had people texting my number (I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re getting it from the app or someone at the restaurant) asking me to pick up their shifts. Usually a quick \u201cI don\u2019t communicate work matters through my number, please send me a message through the app\u201d gets them to stop. Not this time. \r\nA coworker texted me at 5am on Friday, asking if I could take her shift for Saturday. I shoot her the line I send everyone. She\u2019s starts texting like \u201coh it\u2019ll only take a second, this way is just faster\u201d I reiterate I will not communicate through my number and to message me through the app. She continues with \u201cbut you\u2019re already here and I\u2019ve already asked so just take my shift\u201d now I was already working that Saturday night, so not only is she asking me to take her shift, she\u2019s asking me to work a double. I send her the line again. She says that it\u2019s an emergency and that she NEEDS me to cover her shift. I tell her I\u2019m not discussing it any further and that I\u2019m already working Saturday anyways. I then block her number.\r\nI go to work, and am approached by a manager. She asked me why I didn\u2019t show up that morning. I\u2019m confused so she tells me that the coworker said I had agreed to take the shift. I show her the messages. She says okay and goes to the back office.\r\n I get angrily approached by the coworker on Monday about how I said I\u2019d take the shift and now she has a write up because I didn\u2019t show. (She has a write up for \u201cno-call no-show\u201d). I told her I agreed to nothing and even told her I don\u2019t use my number to swap shifts. Conversation goes as so-\r\nCoworker- \u201cbut you said you\u2019d work Saturday!\u201d\r\nMe- \u201cno I said I already work on Saturday\u201d\r\nCoworker- \u201cthen why didn\u2019t you say anything when I thanked you for taking it?\u201d\r\nMe-\u201c cause I blocked you, I didn\u2019t even see that message\u201d\r\nShe starts going off about how I\u2019m so rude and inconsiderate and she just needed me to take one shift. I told her it\u2019s not my problem she didn\u2019t get her shift covered. So I know I\u2019m not TA for not taking her shift, but did I take it to far when I blocked her instead of just answering throughly text?", "created_utc": 1693601142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167ik8k/aita_for_blocking_my_coworkers_number_causing_her/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I work in tech and if I see people reaching out to me on my personal number or email or something I would report them to HR. Work is work in any field. If there is no app in the first place it is okay to reach out to you on your personal number I would assume. But she can\u2019t do that. And if she saw you blocked her, which actually becomes very evident after sending a after getting blocked, she should\u2019ve known. But I\u2019m kinda thinking that maybe giving her a proper response very strongly would\u2019ve been better. You did say you don\u2019t want to communicate outside the app, you did say you are anyway working on Saturday. But maybe saying that you will not be taking her shift just to be extra clear would\u2019ve been better. I don\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t there.

Apparently, based on your post, four times is not enough. You didn't do anything to this woman, she disregarded your requests and she made assumptions. She earned the write up.", "Completely NTA. She repeatedly ignored your request that work changes are only discussed on the app. That is 100% reasonable request. How fricking hard would it have been for her to just do that? She sounds completely annoying.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't get a single positive reply from you that you would work.  You repeatedly told her not to reach out on your personal phone and directed her to the app.  All she had to do was go through the app.  She wasted more time arguing than doing what was asked.  She chose to translate silence into agreement. The list goes on and on.\n\nAbsolutely none of this is on you.  You did everything right.  It was your write up if you went with it.  Your manager saw the texts and sided with you.  \n\nShe's an idiot for assuming any of that was you agreeing.  She was trying to manipulate you and it backfired on her big time.  Now she's trying to get you to think this is somehow your fault. \n\nStay away from this one, cause those are huge red flags.  Hopefully she'll get herself fired  if she's that inattentive to something that's important to her.  Let her hang herself on her own rope.  Manager is aware so she's probably lost trust there.  \n\nDon't ever let her make you think she's right.  She can blame you all she wants, but you have proof.  If she (or her friends on her behalf), start any drama show them the texts.", "NTA.  She refused to take \"no\" for an answer, then proceeded to fuck around, then proceeded to find out.  Your actions didn't cause her to get a write up, her own actions did that.", "NTA she was pushy and made assumptions. She didn\u2019t want to take no for an answer when that was the answer and she refused to be polite when you were very clear with your boundaries. Honestly only an idiot ignores someone\u2019s clear instructions when they want a favor from them.", "ESH.\n\nObviously you don't have to cover someone's shift.  But a simple \"NO, and don't text me again\" would have done a lot of good in this situation.", "From what you've shared, you hadnt given her your number, and you also asked multiple times that she message you via the app. I think just blocking her was a bit harsh though as you do have to work with her.\n\nI'm leaning toward NTA but you could have handled it better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
