Causing her to get a write up?", "selftext": "Most waitress jobs have an app so you can see your shifts and pick up extra ones. You can see who else is working what shifts and can also send messages on this app: this is important for later.\r\n\r\n So at my last job, I allowed others to text my number so they can ask me to pick up shifts. This became ANNOYING because I was the first person they ask and it was anyways \u201can emergency\u201d. They would start using my number for personal conversations and it sometimes got messy because someone would vent to me and then try to continue the conversation in the workplace, causing drama to follow.\r\nSo now at my new job, I\u2019ve decided to keep my work and personal life separate. And I would only communicate through the app. Now keep in mind I\u2019m still really new to the place (I\u2019ve barely been there a month) and I\u2019ve already had people texting my number (I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re getting it from the app or someone at the restaurant) asking me to pick up their shifts. Usually a quick \u201cI don\u2019t communicate work matters through my number, please send me a message through the app\u201d gets them to stop. Not this time. \r\nA coworker texted me at 5am on Friday, asking if I could take her shift for Saturday. I shoot her the line I send everyone. She\u2019s starts texting like \u201coh it\u2019ll only take a second, this way is just faster\u201d I reiterate I will not communicate through my number and to message me through the app. She continues with \u201cbut you\u2019re already here and I\u2019ve already asked so just take my shift\u201d now I was already working that Saturday night, so not only is she asking me to take her shift, she\u2019s asking me to work a double. I send her the line again. She says that it\u2019s an emergency and that she NEEDS me to cover her shift. I tell her I\u2019m not discussing it any further and that I\u2019m already working Saturday anyways. I then block her number.\r\nI go to work, and am approached by a manager. She asked me why I didn\u2019t show up that morning. I\u2019m confused so she tells me that the coworker said I had agreed to take the shift. I show her the messages. She says okay and goes to the back office.\r\n I get angrily approached by the coworker on Monday about how I said I\u2019d take the shift and now she has a write up because I didn\u2019t show. (She has a write up for \u201cno-call no-show\u201d). I told her I agreed to nothing and even told her I don\u2019t use my number to swap shifts. Conversation goes as so-\r\nCoworker- \u201cbut you said you\u2019d work Saturday!\u201d\r\nMe- \u201cno I said I already work on Saturday\u201d\r\nCoworker- \u201cthen why didn\u2019t you say anything when I thanked you for taking it?\u201d\r\nMe-\u201c cause I blocked you, I didn\u2019t even see that message\u201d\r\nShe starts going off about how I\u2019m so rude and inconsiderate and she just needed me to take one shift. I told her it\u2019s not my problem she didn\u2019t get her shift covered. So I know I\u2019m not TA for not taking her shift, but did I take it to far when I blocked her instead of just answering throughly text?", "created_utc": 1693601142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167ik8k/aita_for_blocking_my_coworkers_number_causing_her/", "score": 788, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
