Being called talented and a natural and a prodigy took its toll over time, and I felt that piano and music was my biggest gift to offer the world. Making money doing music is really hard, even harder now with no one buying music and musicians being replaced digitally. When I eventually had to start finding other interests and ways to make money, I had an extremely difficult time, not just because I always believed music would pan out for me,  but because I was always praised for my natural talent and rarely for my work ethic. It\u2019s taken me a long time to enjoy working hard at something to get good at it. I think I would have been far happier and well-adjusted if the adults in my life didn\u2019t call me a prodigy, and instead focused their praise on how hard I was working. The idea that I was far better and more talented at something naturally also made me feel entitled to success and that I was letting everyone, including myself, down when I got burned out and had to take a complete break from music when I was 25. Just my 2 cents. It\u2019s a lovely gift that I am grateful for, but if my own kid happens to have a natural talent as well, I am going to be extremely careful with the language I use with both him and others when I talk about him.", "Nta but be grateful your sister isn\u2019t talking to you she\u2019s annoying", "Did your family make your sister apologize to your nine-year-old?

Didn\u2019t make a real career out of it, but played with lots of symphonies & was basically the preferred substitute for a lot of professional orchestras. \n\nThen she got into a car accident that completely wrecked her hands. Fine motor control was shot. Any time she tried to play, it hurt & her hands would shake horribly. It was awful. It was like a part of her died. She gave me all of her instruments & then just never talked about music again.\n\nI'm absolutely convinced that it contributed to her early death. She just stopped caring about pretty much everything.\n\nSo. Idk. Maybe your daughter is the reincarnation of Marianne Mozart & if she is, that's awesome.
