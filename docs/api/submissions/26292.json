Being called talented and a natural and a prodigy took its toll over time, and I felt that piano and music was my biggest gift to offer the world. Making money doing music is really hard, even harder now with no one buying music and musicians being replaced digitally. When I eventually had to start finding other interests and ways to make money, I had an extremely difficult time, not just because I always believed music would pan out for me,  but because I was always praised for my natural talent and rarely for my work ethic. It\u2019s taken me a long time to enjoy working hard at something to get good at it. I think I would have been far happier and well-adjusted if the adults in my life didn\u2019t call me a prodigy, and instead focused their praise on how hard I was working. The idea that I was far better and more talented at something naturally also made me feel entitled to success and that I was letting everyone, including myself, down when I got burned out and had to take a complete break from music when I was 25. Just my 2 cents. It\u2019s a lovely gift that I am grateful for, but if my own kid happens to have a natural talent as well, I am going to be extremely careful with the language I use with both him and others when I talk about him.", "Nta but be grateful your sister isn\u2019t talking to you she\u2019s annoying", "Did your family make your sister apologize to your nine-year-old?

Didn\u2019t make a real career out of it, but played with lots of symphonies & was basically the preferred substitute for a lot of professional orchestras. \n\nThen she got into a car accident that completely wrecked her hands. Fine motor control was shot. Any time she tried to play, it hurt & her hands would shake horribly. It was awful. It was like a part of her died. She gave me all of her instruments & then just never talked about music again.\n\nI'm absolutely convinced that it contributed to her early death. She just stopped caring about pretty much everything.\n\nSo. Idk. Maybe your daughter is the reincarnation of Marianne Mozart & if she is, that's awesome. Just, definitely make sure she has plenty of other things to define herself with.\n\nJust in case. \ud83d\udc4d", "On the other hand, there are also bitter and cynical parents out there like mine who tell their kids over and over that they will never make it in the arts and that it's too competitive a career until they have no self esteem left whatsoever. \n\nOP and his daughter will know soon enough whether or not this is actually a viable career for her, and if it turns out it isn't, then at least she's had these wonderful experiences in childhood, and she's learned an amazing skill that she can enjoy the rest of her life as well as loads of valuable transferable skills that will help her in other roles too.", ">A lot of parents make their kids continue hobbies they hate just because of natural ability, which ends up killing it forever.\n\nSometimes, and I agree with most of what you are saying, but I also know more kids whose parents let them quit altogether and wish they hadn't.\n\nInstead of playing 6 nights a week how about we play 1-2 for a year, or no big concerts or no public events. \n\nIt is one of those very fine lines, between living for you kid and living through your kid.\n\nBut yes, she should absolutely be allowed to play soft ball even if there is a risk she will break a finger.", "And\u2026dumb. They\u2019re only impressed because she\u2019s a child and OP\u2019s sister could do it if she wanted to?\n\nThat\u2019s the stupidest fucking thing I\u2019ve ever read and I finished The DaVinci Code. \n\n*You\u2019re only impressed by that talking iguana because it\u2019s an iguana! I can talk too!!!!*\n\nI\u2019m so embarrassed on her behalf I am physically uncomfortable", "Exactly", "It sounds shity to say but get used to your sisters behavior.   It's gonna be more people than her the better she gets.   Then when competition from other children and nepotism from better connected kids comes in.   \n\nIt's probably best you got a taste of it now.   That poor girl.   Sometimes it's difficult being the best.", "Huh\u2026 nothing like people inviting themselves over to give unsolicited opinions. Your sister can either learn to be civil like an adult or be treated as a petulant child, and frankly your folks can use a few pointers about keeping your sister in line at this age so as not to bully a 9-year old.", "If this part of your family doesn\u2019t really have an impact in your lives then there\u2019s no point in them really being at the most important events. It\u2019s very sad that your sister needs to try to bring down a 9 year old to feel better about yourself and that your parents feel like your were in the wrong and they apologized to her.", ">I have been told by some of her tutors otherwise.\n\nIt's not just about skill, though. It's largely luck. I have a former child prodigy in my family who is immensely talented. Like your daughter, she was composing symphonies and operas at a young age, and everyone, including her very impressed music teachers, told her she had a bright future in music.\n\nShe did everything right, including going to a prestigious music conservatory for college, and then... It turns out there just aren't that many opportunities for musical geniuses out there. She still teaches music and appears in the productions of the opera house in our city, but it's not enough to pay the bills. Transitioning to entry-level office work was a huge adjustment in her early adulthood, because she always assumed without question music would be her life.\n\nI'm not saying to crush your kid's dreams, but maybe start to build realistic expectations and help her internalize the idea that, if she does something other than music long-term, she won't have failed at her dream.", "Really hits home the quote that a performers first death is when they lose the passion for what they love; the second is their true death.", "Thank you. A little positivity is good for the soul.", "Imagine doing this at kids events - like you\u2019re at a track event for kids \u201cbig deal I can run faster than that!\u201d Like\u2026 what\u2026", "In my high school there was an 7 or 8th grader in our BC calculus class along with a bunch of seniors.

That's definitely a phrase I'm keeping.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s impressive? I\u2019ve been a boy this whole time!\u201d - Big Jack Horner", "I have some family members who are convinced that I need to read The DaVinci code because it has so much \"important\" religious information in it. I simply haven't been willing to. I've been on the fence on and off about it, but John Oliver's episode on it pretty much killed off what little interest I had. I don't know if you've heard of him or his episode on the book, but I highly recommend it for a giggle as long as you don't love the book so much you can't stand it being a subject of laughter.", "That book was fun, be nice.", "\ud83c\udfc5", "Upvote for the reference to classical literature, mostly because I was thinking the exact same thing. :-)"]}
