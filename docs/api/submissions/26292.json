She\u2019s incredibly entitled and spoiled and was especially upset when our parents began caring more about my late wife\u2019s pregnancy with our daughter.\n\nYou may think she and I act the same - but my daughter\u2019s piano talent is not my or her only personality. It just takes up a large portion of our lives. And it\u2019s not all I talk about or the only thing my daughter has for herself.\n\nWe had family fly in from Germany for one of her big recitals for the first time in a few years.\n\nMy daughter did amazingly, but the whole time my sister was saying that they\u2019re only impressed because of how young she is and that she could do this and none of us would be amazed.\nShe proceeded to make the whole recital about herself and when we went out to dinner to celebrate after, and my sister was making snarky comments to my daughter that it wasn\u2019t that good. \n \nI asked her why she had such a fucking vendetta against a 9 year old and why she couldn\u2019t  just for once have the attention be on someone else for a damn night and that if she was going to complain she shouldn\u2019t have come at all.\n\nShe was very upset at this and  told me how I \u2018took away her childhood\u2019 by forcing her to pursue music (which she had come to ME and her late mother about) and it ensued a massive fight between us and she ended up leaving early and going back to her hotel room.\n\nMy parents say that I shouldn\u2019t have lashed out on her like that and they have since apologized for making her feel \u2018left out.\u2019\n\nThey leave for their flight tomorrow night and my sister won\u2019t talk to me.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1693968914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16b8nw8/aita_for_telling_my_sister_to_stop_trying_to/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is 9, that is impressive and your sister just can\u2019t seem to be happy for anyone. Tell your sister and parents if they can\u2019t come support your daughter without making it about themselves then they\u2019re uninvited.

Whether she's a prodigy or not, an adult shouldn't put down a child especially not after their recital. \n\nYour sister needs to apologize to you and your daughter. She also needs to get some therapy because a well rounded adult wouldn't feel threatened by a 9-year old child.", "NTA. She\u2019s pathetic", "NTA, and the only thing more pathetic than a grown woman competing with a 9 yr old for attention is her parents apologizing for not making the world revolve around her for a few hours. \n\nNext time, make sure only people that find your daughter amazing are invited. These losers don't deserve to see this kind of raw talent.", "NTA - When all she knows is being the center of attention, she is going to struggle to cope when she is not.

Your sister is jealous of a 9 year old which is a bit sad, so whilst you were rude, you weren't wrong.\n\nI will say though, musicians are rarely 'massively successful' LOL.  If she is that good, she will get a lot of attention whilst she is a child, but once she grows up, the novelty of being a 'child prodigy' will wear off, and if she isn't prepared for that, it's going to be hard going for her.  She might make a living out of music if she is lucky.  You aren't the one that decides if she is a 'prodigy' either btw - other professionals have to make that pronouncement - you are her father, you think everything she does is amazing so you may be blowing it out of proportion - I hope you aren't building her up for a huge fall - I'm always wary of parents who think their kids are 'geniuses' and 'prodigies'.........with no one outside of their family to back it up.....", "NTA.

The only thing you could be considered an a hole in this is that it disrupted your daughter\u2019s celebration. But if I were your daughter I would have cheered you on.

Your child is only 9, she has plenty of childhood left to experience. As long as your daughter is happy and you're supportive of her interests, pay no mind to your immature sister. \n\nShe's been showered with so much attention for so long by just existing, and now she's probably jealous that a 9yo is more accomplished than she is, despite being an adult.", "NTA.
