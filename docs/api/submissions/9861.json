That is long enough for him to understand that this day signifies something important to you, even though it might just be another day for him, and it is your anniversary, not just valentine's day. \n\nYou did very well the past two years on this day, and he couldn't be bothered with bringing a card? Yeah, don't waste your efforts OP.", "NTA but you are setting yourself up for disappointment when you say \"I want to see if he will do anything\"", "NTA, do you think he will be upset or something? It sounds like he doesn't care about the occasion. Have you discussed this with him? Does he want you to mark the occasion for you both? Holidays are important in my relationship, we discuss these things and what we want to do together.", "No, you will not be the a-hole, as long as you are not using this as a tactic to be \"passive-aggressive,\" \"start a fight,\" etc.  \n\nHe knows that he has upset you the last two years he failed to plan or acknowledge your anniversary, and yet he didn't change his behavior, so you have a predictive model for how this year will go.\n\nHe is a guy that is either not sentimental, doesn't plan, or doesn't really even care to pretend to care about stuff for your sake.  You have to decide if that's okay with you because he is unlikely to change, and if he does it will only be temporarily for your sake, and he will either be annoyed or resentful to do it.  \n\nIs this the only thing that is a problem?  Is he caring and thoughtful in all other ways, but just doesn't like to celebrate or plan things like anniversaries or birthdays?  Look at the whole picture of your relationship, and what, in the scheme of things, is important.  \n\nFor example, if he's loyal, easy to communicate with, a hard-worker, respectful of your opinions, etc., but lousy with planning things and bad with dates, then do all of the other qualities outweigh this shortcoming?\n\nOr, is this shortcoming just a symptom of larger character flaws, such as he doesn't respect your opinions . . . he makes fun of and belittles you for being sentimental . . . he breaks promises, he lies, etc.", "NTA, but you're also not going to fill an unmet need with silence. I would think two years is enough time, but you never really know how well a couple communicates. \n\nFeeling too tired to put in effort for something that matters to you can be the start of feeling too tired for many parts of the relationship, so, you know, proceed with caution and forethought.", "NTA- you are putting the same effort he is putting. And to be honest, doing all those things you did before is nice but may not mean a lot to him. So you are basically putting a lot of effort in something that he may not value the same way you do. Men think these things are nice but many don\u2019t see it as hugely important.", "NTA. But you need to communicate how you feel and come to a compromise with your partner because the current path will lead to resentment and fighting.", "NTA\n\nIf he's not putting the effort in, why should you?  When he asks  why, sit down and have a calm conversation about why you are upset.  Best of luck.", "NTA, but if it's an important day to you and he apparently doesn't feel the same it might be worth being blunt and planning something special together. \n\nI'm an old boring person, but I go with 'hey I want to celebrate xxxxxx day, can you make that dinner I like for it?\"", "NTA as long as you have been communicating with him about your feelings. I would think if this is something you\u2019re willing to deal with for the rest of your life though.", "NTA, but it sounds like you both need to talk it out. These things can fester", "NTA\n\nValentine's day is just another Hallmark holiday. \n\nYou both should be making an effort on your anniversary or at minimum discussing as a couple how you want to handle your day. Make plans together so it's not a me vs him situation. I'd ignore the Valentine part completely and have a talk whim about anniversary expectations. Making plans together is good for the relationship also.", "NTA - start matching his effort in every area while you decide if you want to stay with him.", "I would dump him. He doesn't want to do ANYTHING. It's only going to get worse. Kick the lazy boyfriend to the curb. You deserve better and there's guys out there who will treat you that way. For Valentine's day, since your anniversary is on the 14th why not end it on that day too? Talk about irony.", "If you\u2019re an ass hole then so am I.  (NTA!) He\u2019s said nothing about tomorrow and hasn\u2019t for years (we\u2019re married) so I\u2019m not even getting a card for him. I plan to come home with my own flowers tomorrow.", ">The past 2 years I have decorated the house, got him gifts, a card, made breakfast in bed, booked dinner reservations/or activity.\n\n>the next day February 15th gets me flowers because I\u2019m upset the day before\n\n>I want to act as if Valentine\u2019s Day is just like any other day, to see if he will do anything\n\nNTA. You just have communication issues. You can't shower someone with attention *just* in hopes they'll get the hint that's what you want in return. If you like doing things for Valentine's day, do them. If you just want your bf to do these things for you, that's something you need to actually tell him. He may not even like or appreciate the things you're doing. Not everyone is naturally romantic. You need to figure out why you behave this way, what exactly you want from him and be willing to also listen to what he wants", "NTA, but you may need to consider an exit plan.", "NTA. You two will never be compatible.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

My husband is the same way, and it does hurt. He'll tell me he's going to Walmart to grab me a gift, and then call me from there and ask for my pants size. Smh. I've come to the realization I am the sole planner and if I want to go out or do something specific I have to tell him and pay for it for him. Also, I've now been picking out my own gifts with a Wishlist. This is what works for us. Me paying with his money and him driving. Lol.", "NAH-  One,  definitely not cheesy to have your anniversary on that day.  That is the day my husband and I got together.  Two , coming from someone with a similar prospective,  its hard celebrating your anniversary on that day since everyone else is celebrating Valentines.  I would consider just sitting down and talking to him before you ruin things being passive aggressive (cause that is how you are sounding --- I'm passive aggressive, I know). \n\n I had to do the same with my husband after we got married about how we wanted to spend that day,  and he just wanted to keep it low key since we have our wedding anniversary now and everyone else celebrates Valentine's.   We still make a point to celebrate, but it maybe a day or two later depending on our schedules, but we talk about it far in advance (especially, my MIL bday is around it and she thinks we need to celebrate Valentine's with her cause of that).  Just TALK to him", "I did this once when he forgot my birthday one year. He thought it was the next day and I never said a word believing he would get it. It was the worst one of my life.", "I have brought it up both years. Last month I stated I wanted him to do something for our anniversary. But I don\u2019t think he will. He isn\u2019t the romantic type, nor goes above and beyond for any holiday\u2026 holiday and celebrations are and have always been important in my family\u2026 I still don\u2019t think he will do anything I guess I will see.", "I have been so tempted to that too. To make myself feel better and at least have flowers in the house. I\u2019m happy someone else has thought like me", "Please go read some of the subs where women are 10+ years into their marriages with men who never do a single nice thing for her. If you already feel this way now, imagine what 20 or 30 or 50 years of never having your partner do anything special for your anniversary, birthday, Christmas, or any other occasion would be like for you. Imagine opening no presents on Christmas after dressing up the tree and buying perfect gifts for him, the kids, and his family. Imagine the only flowers you get are apology bouquets. Imagine planning all of your dates, forever.\n\nIf that doesn't feel good to you you need to figure out how to leave or communicate your expectations.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go so far as to call you an asshole but I think you\u2019d be better off holding out for somebody else who also loves celebrating holidays like you do. It doesn\u2019t feel good to ask your partner to *want* to buy you flowers, and it\u2019s not sincere. Wait for a romantic type to come along, life\u2019s too short to be stuck with someone you\u2019re just not compatible with", "Have them delivered with a sweet note, and tell him you have no idea who sent them :D", "He will take that as a further excuse for him to do nothing, I\u2019d imagine."]}
