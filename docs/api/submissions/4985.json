In this kinds of situations it is 100% justified to overstep. These are rare situations and they are always borderline aholish, but extreme measures are for extreme times. E.g. it is hard to discover with strong evidence that your partner cheats without some parts of lying or stalking. How else would you call actions that uncover cheaters? But most people will not blame a person who was sensing an affair and followed their partner. \n\nThis is the same situation. You sensed that she is deliberately berating you and what you did is the only option to know by fact.

Your gf sucks.", "ESH\n\nIt could very well be that you have a lower threshold of what is really good food from a really good restaurant. My husband has much lower expectations from restaurants than I do. Places that he would great, I would say are just mediocre.

There's...really no walking back from this.", "Mmmm I'm gonna say NTA , however , you and your gf need to sit down and have a serious chat about this .

Like, everyone I know who works in a kitchen is always grateful when someone else cooks for them - when you do a thing all day, you generally don\u2019t want to come home and do it some more. \n\nBut she sounds, quite frankly, awful. Gagging and complaining? Info: is your gf actually a toddler???", "NTA But the important question is why does she do this? \n\nShe obviously feels the need to make you feel like you're a shit cook. Is she insecure and if you're not useless at cooking then she feels you're too good? \n\nNow you know why she never gave you useful feedback. Because she needs you to appear bad. Your cooking was probably fine.\n\nBasically she is being a total asshole to you. \n\nShe is mad because she was caught lying and running you down. Do you want to stay in this relationship?", "NTA. If she always complains about your cooking yet still expects you to cook for her, she should appreciate that you actually tried to give her an enjoyable meal and should realize that you lied about it because it fucking sucks to be criticized by someone repeatedly and you were trying to avoid that feeling.", "I was expecting you to be the asshole when I read the title, but after reading about how your girlfriend treats you, I have to go with NTA. \n\nThat said, now that you have executed your elaborate plan to prove that she is being unnecessarily critical and unkind to you, what\u2019s the move?

It's understandable that you were feeling frustrated by your partner's criticism of your cooking, but manipulating the situation and lying to your partner is not a healthy or respectful way to address the issue. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and to find ways to resolve conflicts and differences in a healthy and respectful manner. In this case, it would have been better to have a conversation with your partner about your feelings and to try to find a solution that works for both of you.", "It feels like she\u2019s trying to keep herself above you by doing that maybe she\u2019s a bit intimidated because you\u2019re a good cook.

I have NOT been to cooking school and my approach to cooking has always been \"well, it's edible.\" When I cook, she eats it. She'll provide pointers for the future if I ask. Because of this, my cooking skills have improved significantly. All this without a single dry heave, or any mean comments. What your gf is doing is not healthy or okay.", "Info: have you ever *talked* to her about how her criticisms of all your food make you feel?

Sometimes one wrong feels justified when it leads to the exposure of a larger wrong.", "NTA\n\nYour gf was using her credentials to say you\u2019re not good enough.

I once did something similar to my mom. I wanted to make fried chicken with flax instead of breading but she refused to try it. I ended up making both and then tricked her into trying a flax piece. She loved it of course. She laughed it off when I told her but I also knew she would laugh and that is part of why I did it. But I think maybe you know your gf would be upset and it is kind of a dick move to purposely make her upset. \n\nThat said, your gf is a snob and it\u2019s more important to her to criticize other peoples food than it is to have a nice time with her boyfriend. I think you two should break up simply for the fact that neither of you seem to be able to communicate on an adult level. \n\nDid you even talk to her about her behavior before this or did you just go all the way to this?", "Normal I'd say y t a for tricking her into eating anything she didn't want to.  But as long as it wasnt something she was allergic to/,sensitive to/breaks her dietary/religious eating restrictions, and you didnt do it with the intention to humilate her/break up with her after..\n \n\nBut I think you're right tbh.  I think this is personal.  I think she doesn't want to admit that you can cook, at least semi-competently, without a (I'm guessing) expensive culinary degree.  \n\nI think this test was more to prove that she was going to bash anything you served her, rather than to feed your ego.  And that, imo, is why this makes you NTA.  \n\nIt isn't fair for her to automatically make criticisms of anything she assumes you made, and then go ballistic when she finds out that you didn't make it.  That means, to me, that she just likes to critize you.  If she actually wanted you to learn how to cook, or thought you were doing something wrong, she would be offering to teach you instead of bashing your food and throwing a tantrum when you decided to find out if it's actually your food she has a problem with or just the idea that you can cook at all.", "Nta and the only reason she is giving you the silent treatment is because she is upset she got caught.", "Fuck your girlfriend, dude. I would.", "NTA Now you know that she is putting you down constantly for no good reason. Is there a reason that she feels she needs to make you feel inadequate? Does she have low self esteem and feel she has to damage yours to make you both have low self esteem?\n\nI don't blame you for trying this as an experiment. You found out what you needed to know. Does she lie about other things. I certainly wouldn't cook for her ever again. I don't know if I would want to be in a relationship with someone who would do this to me.", "NTA - I\u2019m married to a chef. That man has eaten my crunchy spaghetti and a hundred other sub par meals, and the most he will say is \u201cchicken is a little \u2026 pink \u2026 let\u2019s throw it back in the pan.

Extreme Asshole behavior right there.", "This sounds exactly like something my aunt would post on facebook.", "NTA, seems like you can\u2019t do anything to please her.", "Read the first paragraph, she's an AH\n\nJust because someone is a chef doesn't mean they need to act up and gag instead of constructive criticism", "I think she is always going to be critical of you - you may want to think whether you want to spend a life like that.", "NTA, but like both of you are being petty and it probably won\u2019t last.", "I don't think it's that much of an AH move, but she is a chef so you are kinda effing with her career.\n\nSo I guess YTA.  But she is a little AHish too pushing her cooking standards on you, an amateur.", "Principal Skinner?", "Eh, I'm gonna say NTA.  Yes, honesty is important, but there was clearly a point to be made here.  \n\nThe whole gagging thing is what puts her behavior over the top.  If you're a chef, you've eaten great food, terrible food, and mediocre food.  Yes, trained chefs can detect things that other can't.  But so long as you weren't serving her something you found in the gutter, the gagging thing seems like pure drama.  She's got some sort of need to put you down in the cooking department, which just reeks of insecurity.\n\nI wouldn't so much as make toast for someone like that. And if I were you I'd give the long term prospects of this relationship serious thought.", "That's more than a little hurtful imo.\n\nFor some reason she is heavily invested in telling you your cooking is sh\\*t no matter what and I'd be questioning why she is *so* keen to put you down.\n\nForget about the trick takeout, constantly criticising all of your cooking, dramatising with the gagging etc. that's just... insulting. Like really mean. Even if she thought your food wasn't seasoned or cooked perfectly, you're clearly not serving her inedible slop.\n\nIf she insists on giving feedback she could give it kindly. Not this big performance she seems to make every time of how terrible it is.\n\nBasically, why is she so keen to sh\\*t on her partner's efforts? That's just.....bad.\n\nNTA", "NTA and what is her deal, is she insecure about her own skills so she has to criticize others?", "NTA.

You aren\u2019t a professional chef, and it\u2019s unfair that she would be so critical and rude when you made food for her. Admittedly i don\u2019t know how good your food may taste, but as long as you put effort into it and it was edible (nothing raw, nothing spoiled, not so over seasoned that it can\u2019t be eaten) then there\u2019s no reason that she should be criticizing you like you\u2019re some contestant on a food contest for amateurs. If your food wasn\u2019t actually good, she could be kind enough to appreciate your efforts and provide constructive criticism.
