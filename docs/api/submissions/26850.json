My parents (M67 and F63) hated Mike from the start; they thought he was a user. I thought they were meddling too much in my business, so (with Mike\u2019s encouragement) I went completely NC with them. They tried repeatedly to get back in contact with me for the next 3 or so years, but I entirely shut them out and didn\u2019t communicate with them at all.\r\n\nAfter Mike dumped me, roughly 4 years after we eloped (almost 5 years ago from today), I was in a pretty rough place. It seemed like years where I was just wandering between pointless relationships and dead-end jobs.\r\n\nFast forward to this year, and I feel that I finally have some stability in my life. In late August, I decided to reach out to my parents again and reconnected with my mom online. She and my dad were both thrilled and invited me over for dinner. I accepted and planned on meeting with them this weekend.\r\n\nAs the date came closer, I started looking at my parents' social media accounts and kept seeing the same woman (and her family) in so many pictures with my parents. She was literally on vacation with my parents, and I even saw my parents with her at her wedding. Even worse, later pictures showed that she had 3 kids and was referring to my own parents as her kids' \u201cgrandma\u201d and \u201cgrandpa\u201d.\r\n\nYesterday, I called my mom and asked her about this lady, and she said that she was a family friend who they met about 5 years ago. She told me that she and my dad became really close with her (and her family) and considered them to be relatives. I was shocked by this and felt pretty emotional. So, I then told my mom that just because I was away, that didn\u2019t give her and my dad permission to essentially replace me.\r\n\nMy mom denied this and said that I couldn\u2019t be replaced. I told her that she was clearly lying based on what those kids were calling her and my dad. My mom started crying, saying that I was blowing things out of proportion, but I hung up. That evening, my dad called me and he sounded pretty angry. He said that I made an active decision to be an idiot and run off and because of that I didn\u2019t have a right to criticize him and my mom \u201cfor going on with their lives\u201d. He mentioned how they tried repeatedly to get into contact with me, but that I kept on keeping them at a distance.\r\n\nI tried to argue with him, saying that we\u2019d never be in this situation if they had been more supportive about me and Mike, but he said that was irrelevant now. I was so angry with him at this stage, so I told him that I would not be coming over. He said that was fine since I couldn\u2019t be trusted to act like an adult.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1694710631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16inmb3/aita_for_cancelling_dinner_with_my_parents_after/", "score": 605, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I cancelled dinner plans with my parents after I discovered how close they have become with some random women and her family (husband and 3 kids).\n2. My parents were really looking forward to seeing me, but since I cancelled they may be upset now. I also accused them of trying to replace me which made my mother cry.

Your parents attempted to contact you, in return you blocked them.  They went on with their lives, made good friends.  \n\nNow you decide you will grant them the presence of you in their lives again\u2026they are thrilled!  You stalk parent\u2019s social media, decide that you are unhappy they did not sit in a dark corner pining away because YOU cut them out.\n\nThen you call your parents, who welcomed you back with open arms to complain that they have friends that care about them.\n\nPlease contact a good therapist.  You need help.  YTA.", "YTA\n\n> I was shocked by this and felt pretty emotional.

My mom started crying, saying that I was blowing things out of proportion, but I hung up.\n\nwtf?!\n\nFirst off, your parents are people too, you know. They have every right to make new close friends.\n\nSecond, I can completely understand why they might be more prone to make new close friends after their daughter ghosted them. \n\nThird, making a new friend isn't *replacing you entirely*. If it's *filling a void you left* and they were thrilled to regain contact with you, they obviously didn't replace you. You can't demand they just live with the void you created.\n\nFourth, they repeatedly tried to maintain contact with you. You burned those bridges and you made sure they were burned.\n\nThey were thrilled to let you back in and the first thing you do is blow things up all over again.", "YTA. A very immature asshole. You broke your relationship with them and when you finally got your head out of your ass, they welcomed you back with open arms. But you just can't help yourself and decided to be jealous of a woman because they have a close friendship with her. Grow the f up.", "YTA. You go NC and then get mad at them for making friends and coping with the loss of their daughter? Very immature. They didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever hear from or see you again. It\u2019s unreasonable of you to be mad at them.", "YTA. You chose to cut off contact with your parents- you chose not to be a part of their lives. They can choose to be friends with whoever they want, and very well may have become friends with this woman and her family even if you had been around. People can love more than one person, and can have adopted family- I have an entire community of family that isn\u2019t my blood family but are closer to me than many of my actual relatives. No one is jealous about that- we build communities for ourselves and love people equally. \n\nOne of the amazing things about people is their capacity for love. Just because your parents didn\u2019t have contact with you doesn\u2019t mean they replaced you. They can love you and still expand their community. \n\nYou are the one who left them without a daughter figure- while they did not replace you, they didn\u2019t have anyone else to shower with attention, so when they found a close friend they had more time than they otherwise would have had. YOU chose this, and they made the most of their lives without you. I\u2019m guessing they would have absolutely no problem loving you both. You are the one with the problem. \n\nIt seems that you are learning that actions have consequences- you made a choice, and because of that you missed out on things and you don\u2019t know your parents as well as you used to. That\u2019s normal and natural after being NC for so long. I hope you decide to forgive yourself and get to know your family again, rather than assuming they just say around bitter and miserable because you left.", "YTA. I understand you were in a controlling relationship, but that doesn't give you any right to control who your parents bring into their lives. They needed a gap filled - it's not a replacement, it's a consolation prize.\n\nAnd then you are also TA for making it their fault by saying if they were more supportive of Mike, you wouldn't be in this situation but from the sounds of it, they had a point.", "She seems to be deleting all of her comments now. I guess she is going NC with all of us. :D  \n\n\nYTA still.", "YTA\n\nYour dad is right, you need to act like an adult. They didn't replace you they found someone who grew to be like family while you were away, that person could have been like family to you too but that wasn't an option with what they had at the time. You chose to go NC and you don't get to be upset because they lived their lives in a manner different than what you'd like especially not when for all they knew they wouldn't speak to you ever again. You can be hurt and have your feelings but you don't get to rag on your parents cuz you don't like the outcome of your decisions.", "YTA \n\nYou sound like a controlling partner. They're not allowed to have friends who are around your age? And those friends aren't allowed to use familial terms? I have so many aunts and uncles and cousins who aren't blood related to me, but I use those terms for them because I care about them and see them as family.\n\nYou're letting your own insecurities further separate you and your parents. I really and truly hope you can see this and reach out to your parents again, and I hope they're open minded about seeing you because you may have put the final nail in the coffin.", "YTA. You probably don\u2019t deserve a relationship with your parents. It sounds harsh but you area jealous and hateful woman. You disowned them and couldn\u2019t comprehend the idea that they have lives outside of you.", "YTA\n\nSo, your parents are not allowed to form bonds with others?\n\nJust because you feel guilty for your mistakes you are making a huge thing out of nothing!  People have the ability to love and bond with more than just one person/family.  \n\nThey have bonded with this woman and her family and you should be celebrating more people to possibly have in your life, yet you are acting like a spoiled teenager.\n\nYou try to blame your parents for your poor life choices when YOU went NC.  \n\nMaybe it is better if you stay out of your parents' lives.  They may be better off", "YTA.\nI understand what you\u2019re feeling, really. My mom used to use her students as replacement children all the time. \u00ab\u00a0this is like my other daughter but she\u2019s better bc ____ type of shit.\u00a0\u00bb\n But you are an adult, and as anyone with siblings can tell you, just because your parents care about someone else doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love you.  They showed concern for your well-being and tried to keep contact. It sounds like they just got close with another family. I find it incredibly hypocritical that you were so upset with them meddling in your relationship that you cut them out of your life but feel the need to dictate who they\u2019re friends with.\n\nSeriously I would get this reaction if you were 13, but 28? If you want a relationship with your parents, you need to treat them like they\u2019re  people, not accessories in your life.", "You could not be more of an AH, OP. You went no contact with your parents FOR YEARS. Do you have any sense how agonizing that would have been for them? They saw you making a big mistake in a toxic relationship and tried to help you. You not only refused but cut them off completely. What did you expect them to do? Sit at home crying and pining and missing you? They missed you every day, but they also had to build more \"family\" into their lives because you left them high and dry. And now that you've come back, they're welcoming you with open arms and you're still being selfish and immature to them. \n\nYTA. Please seek therapy. You really need it and you're going to continue to ruin relationships if you don't do the work.", "YTA\n\n*You* made the decision to cut them off.  *You* are the one who cut contact.\n\nThey tried to reach out to you - for **years**.  You don\u2019t get to be upset that things happened in their life that you don\u2019t know about, when *you* are the one who made the decision to cut all contact.", "YTA.  Your parents have lives outside of being your parents and life moves on either way. If you're upset that this woman and her kids may have taken your place (which they haven't) then you shouldn't have created that vacancy.", "YTA. You went no contact with your parents for years. It's natural that they moved on and formed a new family. It's not \"replacing you\" any more than their having a new biological child would have been replacing you. But you can't expect their lives not to change after all the years you've been gone.", "YTA. Your parents are better off without you. They clearly have a lot of love to give, and could have given it to you and this woman and her family, but you decided it must be all yours or you want none of it.\n\nSo you get none of it.", "Info: You cut your parents out of your life. Why are you upset that they continued on with theirs? You sound insanely immature.", "YTA. You decided to go NC, rejected their repeated attempts to stay in touch, and now you\u2019re angry because your parents formed a new friendship during the period when you were absent from their lives. We\u2019re they supposed to remain in stasis until you decided you wanted to see them again?", "YTA.\n\nI hate to be \"that person\" but you really need to pick better partners, and learn to take off the rose colored glasses every once in a while. If a partner tries to convince you to go NC with family/friends, it's because they're *trapping* you. He was turning you into his obedient little victim, and you fell for it, even after your parents tried, for *years* to help you. Most people don't have anyone who cares about them enough to try to help them for that long. You're just mad that you were an idiot, and are taking it out on everyone else because you can't stand to look yourself in the mirror, and realize that actions have consequences. The only thing a man is going to give a girl for free, is captivity, pretending you didn't know that is pointless, because every woman is fully aware.", "I'm going with YTA.\n\nYou have every right to feel every which way about 'replacement lady', but the way you communicated those feelings was less than ideal (honestly, garbage).\n\nI think you should talk to your parents, and prepare to hear some pretty bitter things. Maybe hearing each others perspectives would help in having empathy and salvaging your relationship.", "YTA. You were the one who broke contact with them. Did you expect them to just sit around for nine years waiting for you to come back? They made a new friend and they all became an integral part of each others lives.", "Yta you can't be for real", ">I (F28) made a pretty dumb decision roughly 9 years ago\n\nYou are still making dumb decisions. Apologize. YTA.", "Yta, you cut them out of your life. Glad you are trying to reconnect but this is the wrong approach.", "YTA. Your parents never had any obligation to be \"supportive\" of a relationship they didn't support. And no wonder they didn't support it; it sounds like Mike wasn't a very good person. In response, you went NC and expected...what exactly? That they sit around and twiddle their thumbs waiting for you to deign to get in contact again? That's not how it works. They have every right to move on with their lives, and that includes making friends. Adding someone to their lives doesn't even mean they've replaced you! They seemed very glad to have their daughter back. You're absolutely acting like a spoiled child thinking you're entitled to their undivided love, _especially_ after nearly a decade of no contact.", "YTA. Your family obviously loves you, go make amends with them", "YTA. You are the one who went NC with your parents. You are being irrationally jealous.", "YTA -  I don't know if you know this, but most people have multiple relatives. Like, I'm guessing you don't have any siblings. They aren't replacing you and you are overreacting. They were more than willing to let you back into their lives and ***you chose*** to throw that opportunity away over a nonsensical crime you made up in your head.", "YTA\n\nYou threw away your relationship with your parents. Now you're mad that in the decade you ignored them (after all you yourself said they tried to contact you and you ignored them) they made new friends.

I don't blame them at all for having an appreciate friend with little kids they can play grandparents for.", "DUDE YOU ARE A MAJOR AH.   Nooooooo please not the consequences of my actions coming back to slap me in the face. \n\nHow entitled are you to think that your parents aren't allowed to make close relationships with other people? \n\nDid you consider their feelings when you went no contact or are your feelings the only feelings that matter? \n\nYou are just pissed that someone else values and appreciates your parents for the kind people they are.

Building close friendships does not replace other relationships. \n\nYou mentioned they were thrilled to hear from you when you reached out; hopefully, you can offer a genuine apology and start working to rebuild a relationship with both your parents.

My parents (M67 and F63) hated Mike from the start; they thought he was a user. I thought they were meddling too much in my business, so (with Mike\u2019s encouragement) I went completely NC with them. They tried repeatedly to get back in contact with me for the next 3 or so years, but I entirely shut them out and didn\u2019t communicate with them at all.\r\n\nAfter Mike dumped me, roughly 4 years after we eloped (almost 5 years ago from today), I was in a pretty rough place. It seemed like years where I was just wandering between pointless relationships and dead-end jobs.\r\n\nFast forward to this year, and I feel that I finally have some stability in my life. In late August, I decided to reach out to my parents again and reconnected with my mom online. She and my dad were both thrilled and invited me over for dinner. I accepted and planned on meeting with them this weekend.\r\n\nAs the date came closer, I started looking at my parents' social media accounts and kept seeing the same woman (and her family) in so many pictures with my parents. She was literally on vacation with my parents, and I even saw my parents with her at her wedding. Even worse, later pictures showed that she had 3 kids and was referring to my own parents as her kids' \u201cgrandma\u201d and \u201cgrandpa\u201d.\r\n\nYesterday, I called my mom and asked her about this lady, and she said that she was a family friend who they met about 5 years ago. She told me that she and my dad became really close with her (and her family) and considered them to be relatives. I was shocked by this and felt pretty emotional. So, I then told my mom that just because I was away, that didn\u2019t give her and my dad permission to essentially replace me.\r\n\nMy mom denied this and said that I couldn\u2019t be replaced. I told her that she was clearly lying based on what those kids were calling her and my dad. My mom started crying, saying that I was blowing things out of proportion, but I hung up. That evening, my dad called me and he sounded pretty angry. He said that I made an active decision to be an idiot and run off and because of that I didn\u2019t have a right to criticize him and my mom \u201cfor going on with their lives\u201d. He mentioned how they tried repeatedly to get into contact with me, but that I kept on keeping them at a distance.\r\n\nI tried to argue with him, saying that we\u2019d never be in this situation if they had been more supportive about me and Mike, but he said that was irrelevant now. I was so angry with him at this stage, so I told him that I would not be coming over. He said that was fine since I couldn\u2019t be trusted to act like an adult.\r\n\nAITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nUnofficially adopted god-child here. I entered my current family at the age of 29. They already had 5 kids (2 from both of them, 2 from one of them, and one legally adopted.) I am about a year older than their oldest. I was raised by a single dad, and he told me for years if something happened to him, or he was ever unavailable, and I needed help, that I could lean on them. He basically chose them as my unofficial god parents after I became an adult. Well the worst happened and he died. 6 months later I found out I was pregnant. I wanted my kids to have good people in their lives, since they were missing a grandfather, so I asked them if they were interested in being official grandparents. They were thrilled and honored. A few months later my husband and I had a substantial unexpected financial setback, and we ended up moving in with them. Not only have their biological and legal children embraced us as family, but their oldest actively thanked me for joining the family, because now pressure was off on her to give them a grandkid. That sister and her husband are now my son's godparents.\n\nLike me, your parent's new friend probably had no intention of taking your place in the family.

Your parents have moved on and have a new family now. Your past mistakes will always be held against you. It's good that you have finally gotten to a place that you are comfortable with.

YOU chose not to reach out to them even after you and Mike broke up. They didn\u2019t cut off contact and stay away - YOU did.\n\nThen you have the audacity to feel like they should have just spent that whole time in sack cloth and ashes, waiting around for you to come back?\n\nI get feeling hurt because you weren\u2019t a part of their life that long, but it\u2019s your fault.

But YOU chose to go NC. Not them. And the fact they became close with someone else has nothing to do with you. It does not mean they were replacing you. The fact they tried so hard to get back in touch with you shows she was not a \u201creplacement\u201d. The fact they\u2019re so excited you\u2019re wanting to reconnect now shows she was never a replacement. People have the capacity to love more than one person. Maybe if you gave it a chance and met her and her kids, you\u2019d love her like a sister, and nieces and nephews. She could be a really meaningful and supportive person added to your life, and it sounds like you need that. But once again you\u2019re shoving away the people who love you. Why? Maybe some counseling would help you answer that. You\u2019re being jealous, petty, and childish.", "You are totally the asshole. You do not get to dictate your parents' relationships either.

You are clearly an only child lol", "YTA. Just came here to up the votes. Honestly, what you are writing in the comments is absolutely surreal. Your parents owed you to care for your needs until you became an adult. That's all. They do not owe you any explanations for their interactions nor do they need your approval for that. My God, I hope you have kids so they can control your interactions ('cause if that' s the rule for your parents then it should apply to you as well), you might just then have a chance at healthy interactions and maybe gain some self awareness. Your life, once you reach adulthood, is influenced by your choices. They are not the cause for your failed relationship. This is fixable though, if you are willing to work a little bit on yourself and apologize, you might be able to have a good relationship with your parents again.

Or are you a troll?", "It's crazy you took the time to write this, but failed to see clearly that YTA. \n\nHonestly, you sound like a little unstable and obviously not mature.

Its unhealthy to let it fester and grow. You become bitter. Those people found a way to cope with it. Different people deal with grief and sadness in different ways. They found a healthy outlet imo. Love is love, its not beholden to blood relatives only", "True that I just said they were correct because he encouraged her to go NC and was apparently a user.  Who knows tho. OP sounds like a lot to deal with who knows if he got blamed for something she did."]}
