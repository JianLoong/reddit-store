He's started chemo and he's progressively gotten sicker and has been spending more and more time in the hospital.\n\nI understand how sad this is it hurts my heart and I know how hard this is on Oscar. Oscar has been there for Andre, going to visit him all the time, sitting with him through chemo , trying to keep his spirits up etc. I love that about Oscar ,but I can tell it's starting to weight on him heavily and hrs spending so much time taking care of Andre that's he's not taking care of himself or enjoying much of anything. His grades have also slipped and he's been do exhausted and down. I feel like he might burn himself out. We still don't know wether or not Andre will beat this , but I don't want Oscar getting \"stuck\" and  to know that regardless of what happens he has to take care of himself too.  That he doesn't have to feel guilty  about living his life and  not just constantly taking care of Andre.\n\nMy husband protested ,but I had a talk with Andre's parents last week  about limiting Oscar's time with Andre at least for a while and they agreed with me. Yesterday I found Oscar crying in his room and I asked if something happened and he told me that Andre's parents had been limiting his visits and that he doesn't know what's going on or why. I told him the truth and he yelled at me about how could I do something like that. I tried to explain to him that it was for his own good and that he couldn't live only for Andre. He just yelled at me to leave him alone and hasn't talked to me since yesterday afternoon. His dad basically said i told you  so and my older kids think I overstepped.

All the time he doesnt get to spend with Andre will just be used on feeling guilty for not being able to be there for him. Youre handling this extremely poorly.", "YTA ah, parents who think that separating young love is the appropriate way to\"save\" their kids.", "YTA\n\nIt's true that you should teach your son to not let his own important things go by the wayside while also helping others, but you did it in a really shitty way.\n\nYou need to spend more time helping your son make plans for how to use his time. More plans for how to help your son take homework to the hospital. More time teaching your son how to self care and avoid burnout.\n\nJust limiting their time, and especially putting that burden onto a potentially dying kid's parents was a double asshole move. It was spineless, subversive, and manipulative. Be better.", "YTA\n\nIf you have concerns about your son's mental health, ability to engage in self care, or coping mechanisms you get him a therapist.

Your son is 15. Not 5. You could have handled this much better by just sitting him down and talking to him instead of deciding something like this over his head.

You and Andre's parents may have legal grounds to separate them, but where the hell do you get the right to force them apart?", "YTA for the way you handled it. I understand you're trying to do what's best for your kid but you should have talked to him about it. Learning how to balance wanting to take care of someone and taking care of yourself is crucial for anyone growing up.

I agree that he shouldn\u2019t burn himself out, but there were better ways like, you know, talking to your own kid. Getting him counseling to help him work through grief and guilt.

Would you be eating and focusing on your work if you were acutely aware someone you love could very likely die? If you truly believe you can answer that question with \"Yes\" then I hope you never have to find out. \n\nOscar is 15. He's not a child you can distract with a shiny toy, or lock in his room in the hopes he'll move on to another new fad. His boyfriend is going through cancer treatment, and what should be evident from his response to being gated out by Andre's parents is that he genuinely loves and wants to support this boy. \n\n*You* have interpreted this as Oscar devoting too much physical labour to Andre which has led to his own issues, and not also a case of emotional distress on his part. You can keep him away from Andre, but short of a lobotomy, you can't stop him worrying about him which is going to once again contribute to these falling grades and lack of self-care you worry so much about. Perhaps he's stressed out because his support network at home involves a mother who goes behind his back rather than communicating like an adult, and a family that 'protest' her decisions but don't actually do anything to correct them.\n\nLet him make his decisions, and get him to see a counselor/therapist if you're worried about his health through this. \n\nThe only coping mechanism your way will teach Oscar, is that should you or your husband ever get cancer or a similar condition, you can be shelved at a whim and will be given an allotted timeslot of care so long as it doesn't conflict with any other priorities. Because you've put him in this rigid box where compassion and self-care can't co-exist.", "NTA.

He really should not sacrifice so much for a relationship at this point in life.", "NAH; just a mom - You definitely overstepped. That is your baby, and you want to protect him, totally understandable, but you're going about it the wrong way. It's his life and he's going through a lot. There's a difference between taking him aside and talking to him about also taking care of himself and making time to do so; it's another to just start cutting out what you consider the problem to be.\n\nGet him in therapy (what he's going through is extremely hard and could very well get worse), help him set a better schedule and help him stick to it (include making sure you can be there and deliver food to him and his family while at the hospital if need be; I'm sure they would appreciate the extra help as well, maybe see about getting other parents involved too so it's not all on you), make sure the school knows what's going on and how is impacting your son, try to help give him the space he needs to be there for someone important to him. You said yourself, no one knows if this kid is even going to make it and your son could potentially be about to go through a terrible heartbreak. He needs you to step up for him, not against him and in his way and as much as you thought this was for him, it sounds like it's not what he wanted and that you didn't talk it out with him first like you should have. \n\nI hope you can work it out with him and help him through this hard time and wish you the best of luck doing so. I also hope things turn around for his bf and things can get back to normal for everyone soon.", "NAH. A 15 year old isn\u2019t equipped to deal with this situation unaided. He\u2019s too young to put all his eggs in this basket when he has his own health and future to deal with. Rather than just cutting his time with Andre down, give him more structured study time, rest time, eating time and Andre time. Make sure he knows you\u2019re not punishing him, and want to afford him as much time as is reasonable with Andre. He clearly can\u2019t make these judgements on his own, and the rest of the family should be supportive of a well-rounded approach.", "NTA - For all the reasons you stated. He\u2019s 15 and it\u2019s your job to protect and care for your child.", "I don\u2019t think you overstepped - Oscar is 15 and as his parents, it\u2019s your job to make sure he is taken care of and knows how to take care of himself.\n\nWhat an awful thing for his boyfriend to be going through, and what a beautiful thing your son is doing for him but 15 is too young to be relied upon for such intensive support, no wonder he\u2019s struggling under the weight of it!\n\nKeep talking about it to Oscar, it may be worth looking at getting him some counselling or another adult to talk to about what he\u2019s going through - and if you can support visits with Andre, that could help them both - keep them to a schedule and have a debrief after each visit, in a cafe somewhere quiet or wherever Oscar feels comfortable. Also stress the importance of his own routines being followed, maybe he needs some gentle encouragement to do the right thing for himself but that\u2019s okay - no one wants to be an expert at handling these scary, intense life moments and I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s experiencing them so early in life.\n\nMake sure he knows how important *he* is, even teaching him \u2018you cannot pour from an empty cup\u2019 might be a little useful.\n\nBest wishes to you all.

I don't think that was fair, appropriate, or considerate.", "But it's also really cruel and callous for op to put the burden and onus of their son's mental held th and overall well being on andre's parents. It's not fair to make the parent's already dealing with so much, further responsible for op's son's mental health and wellness. Especially asking them to do this when op's son is providing support that is likely helping their own kid going through something tragic. Like even though it's fully the right thing to do, you're asking the parents of a possibly dying child to be the ones that actively limit someone that helps their own son, who may not be around too much longer . That's beyond cruel to make them have to do. It's op's responsibility not theirs . Their responsibility right now is to care for their son not safeguard op's son's future", "Yes, there is a risk no matter which way you cut it. That's why I called it a \"tough decision.\" Yes, the mother risks the son hating her. However, she has to worry about his academics for the long run.

This is 'Am I The Devil' material for sure. \n\nYTA", "YTA. If I was your son I'd never speak to you again.

I get where you're coming from but jeez, poor, poor execution.", "YTA, you shouldn't have gone behind his back like that. I understand your concerns for Oscar's wellbeing, but you dealt with it in completely the wrong way, why is your son going to trust you in the future? Limiting visits like this is not going to ease the pain", "When you're worried about someone burning out, you offer them direct support. \"Hey, I see how tired you are and I'm concerned that you won't be able to hit some of your personal goals if you're worrying about your partner. What can I do for you so that you can keep yourself going while caring for your partner?\" Do you even know what your son's goals are, though? He's a young man now, not a kid. Separating people in love is just so cruel, and it never ever works. I just don't understand why people think it'll work out right when * they* do it. \n\nPlease apologize to your son and his partner's parents and tell everyone you acted that way out of distress. A mother can be forgiven! Talk directly to your son from now on, and be very careful about restricting access to his dying love. Get him connected with support groups and learn more about leukemia as a family. Maybe you could even get involved with doing \"race for the cure\" type events! Support your kid. This is a big deal.", "YTA\nYou should have talked to your kid! \nAlso extra doubly bad - you put the onus on the parents of a kid with cancer! Being the caregiver of a loved one with cancer is an enormously traumatic and stressful and difficult thing - and you chose to put this on them! Even if the kid will be ok  the treatment is horrible and the experience excruciating. You chose to ask them to deal with your own parenting responsibilities while they\u2019re going through this.\nNext time, pick up the phone and order to go grocery shopping, make a meal, run to the pharmacy, walk their stupid dog - ANYTHING but asking THEM to do YOU a favor of any kind.\nI\u2019m really horrified at just how callous people can be.", "I can see where you are coming from. I really can. we want to protect our children from everything in this world.\n\nbut. it's their lives. though your stuck comment rubs me the wrong way for some reason. could be because I take care of my husband due to his disabilites.\n\nYTA.", "AITA? You sure are!", "YTA for not discussing this with your own son and going around him to his boyfriend's parents.   No one likes being talked about and decisions made on their behalf with no input.  No wonder he is pissed at you.\n\nWhen he cools off you should try to have a conversation and make sure you apologize.", "You went on trying to help your son the completely wrong way.", "You had the Imother kids parents cut him off before you even TRIED to talk to your own kid? \n\nYTA what your kid needs right know is support. And you are doing exactly the opposite of that.\n\nYes, he needs to spend time away from the hospital and being a caretaker, but that should have been explained to him in a \"pouring from an empty cup way\" you should be helping prepare to cope with the worst, not pulling rugs out from under him. \n\nI really hope he has someone in his life with more empathy than you.", "YTA\n\nThis is an awful thing to do. You have to realize that this isn\u2019t about what you think, it\u2019s about your son. Your son has cancer, and isn\u2019t sure how much time he has left. Give him the right to decide what he wants to do with his time, and don\u2019t purposely do things you know will make him terribly upset.\n\nAs for Andre, that\u2019s also not your right to decide.

Just horrible... Oh, if I haven't made it clear, YTA..", "There's potential that his first love could die and you are limiting his time with his bf.  That's pretty heartless.\n\nWhat's worse is that you couldn't talk to your son about it.  You had to go to the bf's parents and let them be the bad guys.  They're going through a lot as is.  \n\nYTA,  you and the bf's parents.", "i think yta for how you handled it, not that you handled it. you probably needed to interfere but not like that. andres parents have to deal with their own problems with their own child. they dont need to deal with your child, that\u2019s your job. you should be limiting his time (if you think thats what he needs), that isnt on them its on you.", "YTA -- What you did is Manipulative & Controlling under the guise of \"concern\" for your son. Your actions are unforgivable. You make me sick!", "So besides going behind us back to limit his presumably already limited time with Andre, have you done anything to support your son or teach him how to cope with all the stress, have you prepared him for the worse?

YTA", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou went behind your 15 y.o.'s back to get the parents of his dying boyfriend to limit their time together.  Because that's what they needed to put their energy into right now.  Because this was good for your son???\n\nI'm really struggling with what should be first on the list here: lack of empathy?  lack of heart?  lack of sensitivity?  lack of insight?  lack of directness?  lack of compassion?\n\nApologize to your son.  Apologize to Andres parents.  Stop limiting your kid's time with his dying bf.  \n\nMaybe work with a child therapist for a bit in order to understand how better to support your child in this difficult time as I think your instincts were way off and it might be useful to get some outside help.", "You could have talked to your son and made a plan. Like homework must be completed before he goes to see Andre for chemo. Or Tuesdays are for family time or studying! Instead you went behind his back to take away somebody who might not even be here very much longer! Your son probably feels like every moment is precious and you just stole them all!\n\nThen you had the freaking audacity to go to a set of parents who are dealing with their son being gravely ill, who want nothing more than to make him happy and comfortable while going through this.... and you ask them to not let their ill son see your son who makes him happy and brings him comfort! \n\nI would say YTA, but honestly... You're a monster!", "Did talking to your son not occur to you?", "When you have to hope a post is fake.\nJust in case:  YTA.  Obv.", "YTA\n\nYou're not wrong to be worried, but you should have **talked** with your son about his grades etc, given emotional support, advised him about how to deal with tough times & grief etc. not gone behind his back like this & flat out banned them from spending time together.", "YTA\n\nYou are absolutely right, that Oscar\u2019s grief is affecting other aspects of his life. You spoke to Andre\u2019s parents, and I understood that too. You and the other parents have an understanding, which is great. Then it and off the rails.\n\nAt that point, both sets of parents and both boys needed to sit down and have a discussion about balancing needs and setting new expectations. The boys probably wouldn\u2019t have liked it, but they would have been given due respect to have a say in their own lives (especially important when their lives are so out of control due to the cancer). They would have understood why the changes were being made\n\nInstead, your concerns set Andre\u2019s parents to be the bad guys limiting Oscar\u2019s visits. Oscar thinks he did something wrong and unforgivable! He wracked his brain and couldn\u2019t think of what he could have done.  His grief and new guilt are overwhelming when you find him crying.\n\nYou tell him the backstory, thinking you are totally reasonable. What you don\u2019t understand is that you went behind his back and meddled in his life. He can\u2019t trust that you have his best interest at heart because he still feels punished and now knows you will pull strings to make things happen to him and not with him.

I do agree it probably could have been handled differently, but your instinct was correct and don't let reddit tell you otherwise.", "YTA. You have every right to be concerned about your son\u2019s well being and grades. However,  the way you went about it was trash. Why didn\u2019t you talk to your son first? You put the burden on Andre\u2019s parents of having them limit the time between both boys. They have their son\u2019s illness to deal and on top of that he may have a broken heart. It may not have been your intention to infringe on your son\u2019s relationship and hurt him but you did. Intent vs. impact!", "YTA\n\nI mean you went to the parents of a critically ill, possibly dying, child and asked them to address your concerns that your child might be negatively affected by their child dying. So, yeah, you\u2019re very definitely an AH.\n\nAs to keeping your son away, his first love is terribly sick, possibly dying, so he\u2019s going to experience trauma, depression and grief whether he\u2019s spending a lot of time at the hospital or not. He needs support - and yes he needs gentle pushing to put his own oxygen mask on - but you\u2019ve bungled this massively with how you\u2019ve handled it. There will be charities, support groups and online resources offering guidance about the right way to support your son through this - I\u2019d suggest you look to them. Although it might well be that it needs to be your husband who talks to him about this from now on, I doubt your son is going to want to hear it from you now.", "YTA\n\nYour son needs a grief therapist and a mother who supports him. If he is not bathing regularly, make him shower before going to the hospital. Make him a sandwich to take with him to the hospital if he isn\u2019t eating enough. Your son\u2019s grades are impacted because he is depressed because his first love is literally dying in front of him. Talk to the school and his teachers so they know what is going on. More than likely, they will make accommodations if you ask for them. \n\nWhere is your compassion and humanity? This will have a major impact on the rest of your son\u2019s life and how you chose to support him through this will change the course of your relationship. Someone he loves is dying and you are treating it like he should just shrug it off and move on with his life. Not only is that completely unrealistic, it is dismissive and cruel.", "SOFT YTAH- I understand your concerns and don\u2019t necessarily disagree with them- HOWEVER- you should have sat down with your husband and son and discussed this before going to Andre\u2019s parents. They have enough on their plates- \nYou could have asked your son how he is managing/coping- explain that trying to care for and be so involved in Andre\u2019s treatments is draining for both of them- and that perhaps allowing Andres family to take a more active role in supporting their son through this time might be beneficial to all of them.", "YTA. My mother at 17 lost her first love (m17) to leukemia back in the early 1950's. Her parents told her they didn't want her visiting him because it upset her so much. She stuffed her emotional response down so hard that it scarred her for life. It even impacted how she raised her three kids. It created generational trauma in our family. Please, let them spend time together. Give your son the emotional support he needs, whether from you, other family, or a therapist. Bless both those boys. I wish them the best", "Agree. Soft YTA. You want your son to take care of himself, but he\u2019s only 15, so it\u2019s your job to teach him how to do that. Cutting the time he spends with Andre and hoping he\u2019ll start filling it with the other things he\u2019s been neglecting is not the right solution.\n\nI think a therapist is in order because I\u2019m sure your son is overwhelmed.

Having a heart to heart with her kid and supporting him is the way to go", "She should talk to him honestly, but there's really nothing wrong with negotiating it all with the other parent. 15 is still a really, really young age, and it's still the age where parents have to put some soft boundaries."]}
