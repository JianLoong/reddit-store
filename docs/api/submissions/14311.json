He's started chemo and he's progressively gotten sicker and has been spending more and more time in the hospital.\n\nI understand how sad this is it hurts my heart and I know how hard this is on Oscar. Oscar has been there for Andre, going to visit him all the time, sitting with him through chemo , trying to keep his spirits up etc. I love that about Oscar ,but I can tell it's starting to weight on him heavily and hrs spending so much time taking care of Andre that's he's not taking care of himself or enjoying much of anything. His grades have also slipped and he's been do exhausted and down. I feel like he might burn himself out. We still don't know wether or not Andre will beat this , but I don't want Oscar getting \"stuck\" and  to know that regardless of what happens he has to take care of himself too.  That he doesn't have to feel guilty  about living his life and  not just constantly taking care of Andre.\n\nMy husband protested ,but I had a talk with Andre's parents last week  about limiting Oscar's time with Andre at least for a while and they agreed with me. Yesterday I found Oscar crying in his room and I asked if something happened and he told me that Andre's parents had been limiting his visits and that he doesn't know what's going on or why. I told him the truth and he yelled at me about how could I do something like that. I tried to explain to him that it was for his own good and that he couldn't live only for Andre. He just yelled at me to leave him alone and hasn't talked to me since yesterday afternoon. His dad basically said i told you  so and my older kids think I overstepped.

All the time he doesnt get to spend with Andre will just be used on feeling guilty for not being able to be there for him.

More plans for how to help your son take homework to the hospital. More time teaching your son how to self care and avoid burnout.\n\nJust limiting their time, and especially putting that burden onto a potentially dying kid's parents was a double asshole move. It was spineless, subversive, and manipulative. Be better.", "YTA\n\nIf you have concerns about your son's mental health, ability to engage in self care, or coping mechanisms you get him a therapist.

Your son is 15. Not 5. You could have handled this much better by just sitting him down and talking to him instead of deciding something like this over his head.

You and Andre's parents may have legal grounds to separate them, but where the hell do you get the right to force them apart?", "YTA for the way you handled it. I understand you're trying to do what's best for your kid but you should have talked to him about it. Learning how to balance wanting to take care of someone and taking care of yourself is crucial for anyone growing up.

I agree that he shouldn\u2019t burn himself out, but there were better ways like, you know, talking to your own kid. Getting him counseling to help him work through grief and guilt.

Would you be eating and focusing on your work if you were acutely aware someone you love could very likely die? If you truly believe you can answer that question with \"Yes\" then I hope you never have to find out. \n\nOscar is 15. He's not a child you can distract with a shiny toy, or lock in his room in the hopes he'll move on to another new fad. His boyfriend is going through cancer treatment, and what should be evident from his response to being gated out by Andre's parents is that he genuinely loves and wants to support this boy. \n\n*You* have interpreted this as Oscar devoting too much physical labour to Andre which has led to his own issues, and not also a case of emotional distress on his part. You can keep him away from Andre, but short of a lobotomy, you can't stop him worrying about him which is going to once again contribute to these falling grades and lack of self-care you worry so much about. Perhaps he's stressed out because his support network at home involves a mother who goes behind his back rather than communicating like an adult, and a family that 'protest' her decisions but don't actually do anything to correct them.\n\nLet him make his decisions, and get him to see a counselor/therapist if you're worried about his health through this. \n\nThe only coping mechanism your way will teach Oscar, is that should you or your husband ever get cancer or a similar condition, you can be shelved at a whim and will be given an allotted timeslot of care so long as it doesn't conflict with any other priorities. Because you've put him in this rigid box where compassion and self-care can't co-exist.", "NTA.

He really should not sacrifice so much for a relationship at this point in life.", "NAH; just a mom - You definitely overstepped. That is your baby, and you want to protect him, totally understandable, but you're going about it the wrong way. It's his life and he's going through a lot. There's a difference between taking him aside and talking to him about also taking care of himself and making time to do so; it's another to just start cutting out what you consider the problem to be.\n\nGet him in therapy (what he's going through is extremely hard and could very well get worse), help him set a better schedule and help him stick to it (include making sure you can be there and deliver food to him and his family while at the hospital if need be; I'm sure they would appreciate the extra help as well, maybe see about getting other parents involved too so it's not all on you), make sure the school knows what's going on and how is impacting your son, try to help give him the space he needs to be there for someone important to him. You said yourself, no one knows if this kid is even going to make it and your son could potentially be about to go through a terrible heartbreak. He needs you to step up for him, not against him and in his way and as much as you thought this was for him, it sounds like it's not what he wanted and that you didn't talk it out with him first like you should have. \n\nI hope you can work it out with him and help him through this hard time and wish you the best of luck doing so. I also hope things turn around for his bf and things can get back to normal for everyone soon.", "NAH. A 15 year old isn\u2019t equipped to deal with this situation unaided. He\u2019s too young to put all his eggs in this basket when he has his own health and future to deal with. Rather than just cutting his time with Andre down, give him more structured study time, rest time, eating time and Andre time. Make sure he knows you\u2019re not punishing him, and want to afford him as much time as is reasonable with Andre. He clearly can\u2019t make these judgements on his own, and the rest of the family should be supportive of a well-rounded approach.", "NTA - For all the reasons you stated. He\u2019s 15 and it\u2019s your job to protect and care for your child.", "I don\u2019t think you overstepped - Oscar is 15 and as his parents, it\u2019s your job to make sure he is taken care of and knows how to take care of himself.\n\nWhat an awful thing for his boyfriend to be going through, and what a beautiful thing your son is doing for him but 15 is too young to be relied upon for such intensive support, no wonder he\u2019s struggling under the weight of it!\n\nKeep talking about it to Oscar, it may be worth looking at getting him some counselling or another adult to talk to about what he\u2019s going through - and if you can support visits with Andre, that could help them both - keep them to a schedule and have a debrief after each visit, in a cafe somewhere quiet or wherever Oscar feels comfortable. Also stress the importance of his own routines being followed, maybe he needs some gentle encouragement to do the right thing for himself but that\u2019s okay - no one wants to be an expert at handling these scary, intense life moments and I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s experiencing them so early in life.\n\nMake sure he knows how important *he* is, even teaching him \u2018you cannot pour from an empty cup\u2019 might be a little useful.\n\nBest wishes to you all.

I don't think that was fair, appropriate, or considerate.", "But it's also really cruel and callous for op to put the burden and onus of their son's mental held th and overall well being on andre's parents. It's not fair to make the parent's already dealing with so much, further responsible for op's son's mental health and wellness. Especially asking them to do this when op's son is providing support that is likely helping their own kid going through something tragic. Like even though it's fully the right thing to do, you're asking the parents of a possibly dying child to be the ones that actively limit someone that helps their own son, who may not be around too much longer . That's beyond cruel to make them have to do. It's op's responsibility not theirs . Their responsibility right now is to care for their son not safeguard op's son's future", "Yes, there is a risk no matter which way you cut it. That's why I called it a \"tough decision.\" Yes, the mother risks the son hating her. However, she has to worry about his academics for the long run. Have you never read a story of \"I hated my parents for doing this when I was little, but now that I'm older, I finally understand\"?"]}
