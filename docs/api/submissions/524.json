TLDR at the bottom. \n\nSo to give context:  I (36M) have been dating my girlfriend, Lauren (31F) since May/June this year. She is a funny, athletic and fit, gorgeous woman and I do love her. Before Lauren, I was in a relationship with Kelsey (27F) for the duration of my 30s, so around 5 years. Due to circumstance I am currently living with Lauren. \n\nLauren came home from work yesterday and everything seemed perfectly normal. I had a day off so I\u2019d made dinner ready for her because she got off her shift late and I knew she wouldn\u2019t have the energy to cook. I sat with her and talked as she was eating and she began to get more cold and distant in her responses, but I accredited this to tiredness. When I went to get her a second drink her whole attitude changed. I asked her what was wrong. Nothing. I asked her again. Still nothing. I asked a third time. \u201cWhy was Kelsey texting you a few mornings ago?\u201d. There it is. \n\nIt was Kelsey\u2019s birthday this week, so I sent her a short and simple happy birthday text. Kelsey doesn\u2019t like to leave texts unresponded because she thinks it\u2019s ignorant, so she responded. It was cordial bordering on cold. I didn\u2019t text back. \n\nHere is where I may be TA: I told Lauren that Kel and I had been together for a long time, and that there was nothing wrong with me wishing her well on her birthday, which is something she struggles with. In my opinion, as there is nothing going on between Kelsey and myself, it isn\u2019t Lauren\u2019s business who I\u2019m talking to, and she should not have been looking through my messages.  \n\nLauren missed the roof and went skyrocketing towards the moon. She started yelling about how shitty it was that I was texting someone who resented her existence and would not acknowledge our relationship and then not telling her. I told her Kel did acknowledge our relationship but that seemed to anger her more. \n\nAs of the last 3 nights I\u2019ve been relegated to the couch. So, Reddit, AITA for sending a birthday message? do I need to buy flowers and apologise?  \n\nTLDR: I sent my friend / ex a birthday message. Current gf snooped through my messages and saw it.

Dating a cheater would also explain Laurens neurotic paranoia.", "While I don't  necessarily think you're an A.H for sending the text I think you are definitely a jerk.

In fact, if I was Kelsey I would be appreciative that you took the time to send a message. No matter who the person is, a birthday wish just shows that you are a caring person and willing to look past any difficulties you had.\n\nYour gf on the other hand... there is something wrong there (not in a bad way).

What was the point of texting her?  If you want to move forward in your new relationship stop texting the girl who disrespected your new GF.", "I left my relationship with Kelsey (rocky but trying) to be with Lauren. I do not remember how I told Kelsey about Lauren but I do know that she has refused to talk about it since and simply says that the way I did it was horrid and she doesn\u2019t know how to get over that. Kelsey doesn\u2019t resent Lauren as a person, she just sees her as the athletic dumb leggy brunette (compared to her plus size, alternative / gothic, intelligent, redhead) who walked in and fucked up her life.  The most I can ever think of her being resentful or disrespectful towards Lauren is a private phone call that Lauren doesn\u2019t know about, after which I went NC with Kel until I sent her that birthday text.", "That depends on who you ask. Kelsey and I were in a solid relationship for 3 years and then the final 18 months was on/off. I permanently ended things with her when my friends set me up with Lauren and we went on our first date. To the best of my knowledge, Kelsey doesn\u2019t consider me to have cheated on her (her group of closest female friends do, though, and they all made that clear) but she does feel \u201cbetrayed\u201d by me for \u201cwhat I did do her\u201d. My friends don\u2019t see anything wrong with what I did but all of our mutual friends also sided with her and called me a gross / shitty person.", "You can break up and remain friends, thats not that weird", "There was no sneaking off involved?", "Oh okay, i don\u2019t think YTA then, a harmless birthday text is nothing to make a big deal about. Lauren does sound a little insecure tho which is only human, she definitely should NOT have read your chats, that\u2019s your own business but maybe have a conversation and if Lauren really has a big issue with this ex, you could just go no contact again out of respect for the relationship? Nonetheless you\u2019re NTA.", "Assuming then, that you were in a definite \"off- we have permission to date others\" period, not just an \"off- I need space to think,\" then NTA.\n\nBut consider this a lesson. On/ off doesn't work. Ever. Someone always gets hurt, in this case, Kelsey. And yes she thinks you cheated. Her friends are an echo chamber of her thoughts. Let Kelsey move on without you in her life.", "It doesn't seem like there's any friendship remaining from your responses tbh. Why then?", "I was planning on it. If circumstances were different, Kelsey and I would\u2019ve been married by now. But they aren\u2019t so we are not and that\u2019s all there is to it.

We\u2019ve been  NC since that point because she refused to respect Lauren in the way I needed her to for us to remain friends.

She\u2019s the only ex I have that I\u2019ve wanted to stay friends with but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to work out that way.", "I don\u2019t think you are the asshole here. I am curious though, do you think you went with Lauren because of her physical aspects? Why do you feel you would have married Kelsey? I don\u2019t have a lot of information, but it just seems like Kelsey was kinder? You talk about her in a positive way when describing how she interacts with people and you.", "Apols Nitro", "I understand your girlfriend. You don't suddenly send an ex you're NC a birthday message with. Especially not if you're NC because she's not happy with your current girlfriend. YTA", "Kelsey was there for me through a lot of stuff and through me treating her like garbage whilst I was dealing  with my own issues, she definitely had her own issues and baggage and problems in relationships. Lauren\u2019s physical aspects do play a factor but only a small one, one of the biggest things for me was that Kel lives several hours away whilst Lauren is right here, right now.", "Wishing you the best to come your way!"]}
