I only noticed because I recognized the username when he liked a video I posted. I told my husband about this, and we decided to block the account. (It was\u00a0obviously him)\u00a0\n\nSo, we went out for dinner with my husband\u2019s family (including Eric, his wife, and his newborn son) for Mother\u2019s Day yesterday. It was a nice get-together initially, but then Eric kept asking me how work was going and kept asking for super specific details. He wouldn\u2019t leave me alone, to the point that my FIL noticed and cracked a joke about it.\n\nI still am not sure what the point of asking me about work was exactly, to make me lie, to embarrass me, to make me confess what I do, and shock everyone?

I said that he had been fixating on what I do for work all night and that it was starting to piss me off because I just had to block him and refund his money on the site he subscribed to.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, my husband and I left early.\u00a0My in-laws clearly don\u2019t approve of me now, and Eric and his wife were furious. Eric said that his family doesn\u2019t want to be around both my husband and myself until I apologize to him and his wife for wrongly accusing him of \u201cwatching that filth.\u201d\n\nThe thing is, I 100% believe that it was him and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that he tried to bully me over something that has nothing to do with him.

She said so in response to one of my comments on this post, and used that exact word, hence I brought it up", "Can\u2019t sit arguing about whether or not it\u2019s public or private. The answer to the ultimate question stays the same.", "maybe she likes doing porn. maybe you and Eric and everyone else should mind your own fucking business.", "Okie dokie", "NTA, and may I say, you are on FIRE. Excellent response, he was clearly trying to either blackmail you or otherwise put himself in a position of power over you because of your job. \n\nSucks to be him, he didn't succeed and instead just outed himself as a creep of the highest order - seriously, who TF subscribes to the adult channel of their SIL?", "NTA. Classic FAFO!", "NTA, but this is why you don't feed trolls.", "NTA.  There's nothing wrong with what you do.  He f*ed around and he found out.  Good for you for how you handled it.", "He was probably pissed she dared block him and wrongly assumed it was because she was ashamed. \n\nBIL was being a creepy perv and a bully. I wonder if OP can screenshot the blocked accounts and send that over to SIL", "I don\u2019t understand how OP not allowing herself to be bullied in front of a group of people makes her the AH. If the husband wasn\u2019t okay with OP stating what she did, she probably would\u2019ve mentioned it in the post.", "How is she policing his though? She\u2019s just making it known, the ones who will be going after it for him are the rest of his family to the point that he won\u2019t admit it.", "Wtf? Who pays to intentionally watch their sister in law? That\u2019s weird dude.\n\nPlus he got refunded\u2026 you\u2019re a weirdo.", "That\u2019s his own fault for not dropping the subject sweetie. \ud83d\ude0c\nLet him find out actions have consequences.", "Send it to his wife for sure. She should know", "NTA. Wish you could have confirmed for sure. Sounds like it was definitely him though. Your comeback was gold.", "What relationship? Are you actually considering apologizing to them, screw all that. Send the proof to his wife and wash your hands of them", "Because she did allow herself to be bullied. She gave the bully everything he wanted, by coming out in front of her in-laws with \"I make porn\", and outing her husband to his family.", "Hey Eric you're literally behaving like a sexual predator leave your SIL alone before she gets a restraining order and your disgusting hypocritical creepy behaviour is outed to more people.\n\n Her doing sex work doesn't mean she's less of a person or not allowed to have boundaries & if you think that you've got more in common with Ted Bundy than Jesus\n\nOP is NTA", "Lol definitely Eric\u2019s account.", "Being indignant about people acting creepy towards you seems pretty justified. I\u2019d put buying open of your family squarely in that category.", "I found Eric!", "Did you defend satan in court?", "Ya last week", "Lol the consequences I\u2019d your BIL coming out as a total hypocritical creep lmao. Hard one to predict.", "Lol problem solve critically, very hard to believe.", "NTA, BIL is a creep.", "NTA.\n\nYou are taking the high road by not sending proof of BIL's porn use to his wife. However, he says you are \"wrongly accusing him.\" I suggest you send proof to BIL (cc your husband so it's clear you are not attempting coercion.) BIL must learn to eschew lying as well as blackmail.", "NTA\n\nIf you were wrong to accuse him, how does he know the content you produce qualifies as \u201cfilth\u201d? Yes, you called it porn, but that word means different things to different people. \n\nHe absolutely was trying to let you know he knew and make you squirm, at the very least. He may have assumed your husband did not know and thought he could leverage his knowledge over you.", "I know it's always easier for a stranger to come up with a comeback after the fact, but for anyone else who finds themself in this situation, here's one I thought of: \"Work's been good. In fact, I saw \\*your\\* name signed up on my client list last week! How funny. Of course due to the conflict of interest, I wasn't able to accept you as a client. But what a small world!\" Coupled with the same meaningful look he's giving you.", "NTA, he was trying to emotionally blackmail u and it backfired. Good for u.", "I don't care what his reason was, whether he wanted to watch you or blackmail you or embarrass you. \n\nNTA. You owe no one an apology. (Incidentally, I'm a conservative Christian. I still think your BIL is a creep and a jerk.)", "NTA. A+ job just owning it. It was the best tactic. He was trying to humiliate you and instead you humiliated him. Guarantee his wife believes he was watching your porn account. That idiot just set himself up for a potential divorce because he just couldn't resist trying to publicly pretend he has some power over you. Good for you!", "INFO:  Are you sure he didn\u2019t subscribe to confirm it was you?  Is it possible he was send the information by someone else and he was confirming before telling his brother?  Did he need to subscribe to see it was you?\n\n(I doubt this is it but I am just trying to consider the options.)", "NTA", "Whether or not you AITA is moot\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems you stood nothing to gain from handling it like that, you could have had the desired outcome speaking privately with him?", "NTA. He fucked around and he is dangerously close to finding out.", "NTA. Slay queen. Don\u2019t apologize.", "NTA, and if he gets in trouble with his wife for doing something that the rules in their relationship prohibits, then well, at least now she knows. It's better that you let the cat out of the bag now then let him possibly blackmail you with it later. At least when you went down, you took him with you, I mean, what else could he expect?", "NTA. \n\nYou must feel relieved to have it out in the open.", "NTA. He was trying to do some weird power play and you one upped him. Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take what\u2019s coming back!", "Take screenshots of his subscription and send it to his wife. NTA", "NTA. He fucked around and found out...", "NTA - BIL is trying to bait you in looking bad in front of the in-laws. Whatever the reason, it is a clear sign that he either dislikes or is disapproving of you. I would stay away from him and block him on everywhere else. Also, you don't have to be with your in-laws if they disapprove of your lifestyle. They do not hold power over your marriage. You and your husband do, and it seems that you both are clearly happy and are capable of having a life together. So screw them.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nand I\u2019m glad your husband has your back on this, I would limit or no contact if and when that might be possible.", "The word is anyway no s on the end.", "NTA. You're being nice. Use the word: blackmail and I wouldn't even want to think what he wants to blackmail you into.  \nWhat you do in your own time is up to you.  \nKnowing religious types, I've had to deal with them all my life, some of them can be the biggest hypocrites on the planet.  \nFurther, it's 2023, watching porn is hohum, whatever. There is nothing wrong with what you do. It's consensual and legal and it's better then what the church has been up to for the past few hundred  decades. For your BIL to turn that into a negative, he's just being a prick.", "NTA. I feel like there are certain boundaries you just don't cross because they are perverse and creepy and your BIL subscribing to seeing your porn is one of them. He found the account and chose to subscribe, and then he tried to hurt, annoy, and antagonize you for some semblance of power over you with your husband's family.   \n\n\nYou snapped back and he didn't like that his BS and intentional antagonism was being called out. His family, being in denial wants to refute it, he being caught wants to refute it but it's a bit challenging when the username was eerily similar to others he uses. It wouldn't be hard to make the stretch. Don't let him or your in-laws' outlook on it bother you.   \n\n\nUltimately, you're okay with doing it, and your husband is okay with you doing it and it doesn't cause any rifts in your marriage - that's the important part. What his family thinks, is the absolute least important part here. They can grow up and stay in their lane and let you and your husband live your best lives. You don't owe anyone an apology at all. On the contrary, your BIL owes you an apology for being intentionally antagonistic - which he wouldn't have had cause to be if he didn't know it was something he could try to hold over your head.", "I wonder how many people have DMed you asking for the link to your OF?", "Seems like BIL's wife should check the credit card.  The only way he found OP's account is because he has been on the site. It is unlikely that OP's account is the first he subscribed to.", "The BIL\u2019s behavior is so weird. So I guess I hope you\u2019re right that seems the least worrisome of how he acted.", "He liked a video she posted though, so if that was the case he definitely got a little too involved with the private investigating lol", "Absolutely. And at very least, he's objectifying his brother's wife. Nothing good was going on in this situation. Idk why the husband isn't more upset with his brother. NTA OP, everyone has a breaking point and he was definitely antagonizing you", "The \"or worse\" is the part that concerns me about this.\n\nHe is behaving like someone who wants to - and believes he has the right to - control and dominate someone else. He's getting off on feeling like he has power over you. Please be careful, OP, and maybe don't be alone with him.", "Totally agree. I think this guy is a dangerous guy to have in OPs life. Good riddance to him. He wanted to perv over his SIL behind his wife's back, got pissed that he was blocked and then wanted to make it known that he has the \"power\" because he had this information about her job.\nNTA", "The relationship is already damaged and right now it's probable that your PIL are being fed lies by bil, your pil and sil will want to believe your bil manipulations not only because of their familial connection but because of their shared belief system along with the fact you are now persona non gratis due to your admission...they will view you as morally corrupt and therefore not trustworthy.\n\n I would go balls to the wall over the fact your bil has deliberately damaged your dh's relationship  with his parents and yours, he is hurting your family now and for what? Nah, don't take the high road and you have come this far, you laid your own tactic down so see it through. Lob that screenshot grenade now. NTA", "Oh babygirl. He is the only one damaging his relationship by trying to subscribe to his SIL porn account. Whatever consequences he faces is his problem. Send them.", "I think we all agree what he was doing with the videos. \n\nBut playing devil\u2019s advocate: Maybe he was trying to save it so he could show his brother and that is all he could figure out?  Highly unlikely but it is possible I think.", "She\u2019s legally allowed but still an AH", "Sister-in-law = not related by blood", "Exactly this and his attempts at trying to gain power over her shows what BS his denial of it all was. I really hope he and his wife went home and she demanded to see CC statements.", "exactly.  people dont know when to shut up and leave well enough alone smh \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I know it's easy for me to tell OP to go scorched earth when I don't have to live with the results, but GO SCORCHED EARTH lol", "WTF did the SIL do? She just learned that her husband is trying buy porn of her brother's wife and now we're just randomly insulting her?", "The fact that this is getting upvoted just shows you how garbage most of the people reading this subreddit are.  \n\nJust because she does porn and her husband is cool with it doesn't mean they are running around slapping each other on the butt and screaming \"get er done\", don't be creepy.\n\nSomeone tells me they do porn, I don't immediately think it's ok to just make sexual jokes with them.", "I\u2019d say OPs BIL subbing to her porn account while he has a WIFE AND NEWBORN says more but ya know. Whatever I guess \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02", "No, she didn\u2019t give him anything \ud83d\ude02\nShe called him out, in front of his WIFE and CONSERVATIVE FAMILY about subbing to the spicey site. OP needs to send the screenshots of his social usernames along with the SAME username, and legal first name BIL has, to the wife. That\u2019s gonna be one big o o f for the Wife of BIL. \ud83d\ude02", "Who pays for porn just to make sure it's one of their relatives. Gross. That doesn't make it any better.", "married Eric.\n\nif she didn't want to be insulted, she shouldn't have married Eric \ud83e\udd23", "Agreed.", "I'm gonna go ahead and assume that she's ok with her husband making sexual jokes. But I'm not sure where a joke was made and how that is relevant.", "r/UsernameChecksOut", "ESH is not YTA. The BIL is absolutely an asshole, but OP still outed her husband as married to a sex worker to his family and gave BiL what he wanted.", "She told her husband's family that he was married to a pornographer. That conservative family cares FAR more about the OP being a pornographer than BIL snooping on a porn site, especially since said BIL maintained plausible deniability.\n\nShe got herself and her husband alienated by their family, which is exactly what BIL wanted.", "If he thinks he is morally superior to everyone else, I could easily see him \u201cpaying to check it is her\u201d. Maybe he wanted proof of her \u201csins\u201d to bring to his brother to pressure him into leaving her?"]}
