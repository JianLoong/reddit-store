She deserves to know who she married.", "Man, BIL was so supportive, even paying for a subscription. He probably asked how it was going cus you blocked him.\n\nNot very nice of you", "NTA.\n\nWhy does he even have an account on there???", "ESH you\u2019re not the AH for getting furious at him when he kept going and annoying you. That was completely out of line and he deserves to be called out. \n\nHowever, acting like it\u2019s something you can keep a secret forever and blocking him makes you kinda ESH - I understand not wanting your BIL watching you do porn, but maybe you shouldn\u2019t do so publicly then? You do you, but people around you are gonna find out at some point and some, not all, are gonna want to see what\u2019s up - and, unfairly, some are also gonna judge you.", "YTA for openly declaring private information.  I don't know what country you're in, but you could actually get in legal trouble for publicly announcing your subscribers. The fact that he subscribed to your site was private information and not yours to disclose.\n\nYou can't call somebody \"creepy\" for buying what you're selling. If you're okay with making porn and selling it to the public, you have to be okay with somebody looking at it. Indeed, it's what you're literally asking for \u2014 customers.\n\nLife Pro Tip: don't do things that make you ashamed \u2014 especially publicly.  And don't go telling me you're not ashamed of it. If you weren't, you wouldn't be hiding it. You wouldn't be mad that people found out about it.", "I need popcorn bucket sounds link intresting drama", "NTA. You've truly proven that maxim that sometimes those most fascinated by porn and \"deviant\" sexuality are some of the largest and most repressed consumers of that same content. Their repressed sexuality needs an outlet and so their hypocrisy screams out quite loudly and knows no bounds. All in all quite a mess though as even giving BIL \"free\" access to your spicy content creates a situation of your husband's brother lusting after you. Not pretty.", "Where there's smoke there's fire.  Yours is probably not the only site he has wandered  into with his credit card..  \nMethinks there is some explaining to be done here by one BIL  \nNTA", "I\u2019m I\u2019m", "Since he wanteed to shame you, do the same with this subscription info.", "NTA\n\nBIL is a snake. Ego-tripping, probably coercive and 100% guilty. Screaming blue murder and throwing accusations to divert attention.\n\nIf you can, go NC", "NTA. I might have played up the insurance policy angle tho: \u201cYeah, so I saw you were wanting in on my business, but asking for a policy \u2018just in case your wife was murdered\u2019 seemed pretty conflict of interest for me, so I had to turn you down, obvs\u2026.\u201d\u2026.What\u2019s he gonna say to That?! \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. But publicly apologise in front of everyone for getting angry at a family function and give him a USB stick with the bits from your porn videos that he's subscribed to as compensation for blocking him. Tell him in front of everyone what it is, and that it's an apology gift for depriving him of the pleasure of watching you and that you know these are his favourite scenes", "NTA. He dug his own hole", "NTA he was obviously baiting you into having some sort of reaction and saying something to the family. \n\n\nI get being concerned about your husband being in the middle of this all. Have you talked to him about it and gotten his perspective? He knows what you do for work and knows how his family is so one would assume that he had considered how they might react when they found out.", "NTA.\n\nBut expect demands for money.  You now have a perfect 'out': that they wouldn't DARE to touch such 'filthy' money because you'd out THEM to their religious community.", "Nta. Good for you! You called him out. He had to have known. I think he was fishing w the questions, trying to find out if you guys knew it was him & as a threat that if you tell on him, he will tell your business.", "Dude, if you want to write stories about women doing porn and being exposed, there are erotic story subs to do it in. YTA.", "You were an absolute fool for not using this against him when he attacked you.  By leaving early you made yourself the bad one rather than him being the creep who wants to see his SIL naked.\n\nNTA", "confused here. you just said that BIL wanted everyone to know that you make porn. which is disgusting imo. however, thats besides the point because you never accused him of watching porn. \n\nNTA", "NTA . Your brother in law is gross. He wanted to watch your content, but then when he realised you knew it was him and blocked him, he decided to try and provoke and embarrass you. He's the only one who should be embarrassed. What a sad little man. \nKeep making that money !!!!!!", "He really did not expect what he got! NTA.", "Lol. \u201cOnly plants\u201d My boomer mom keeps calling it \u201cJust Fans\u201d \ud83e\udd23", "I would add, quite simply, if you make porn for a living, you can't get mad at people for looking at it. Why, exactly, did you block him?", "The handle suggests he was already signed up as well, I assume he'd use a different name otherwise. Unless he wanted her to know!", "You can't  cause more damage he did all the damage when he decided to pay to see your content . Are you and hubby OK with what you do ? I assume the answer is yes so don't stress about everyone else - the inlaws will get over the shock .", "Definitely send it to his wife. NTA.", "he's welcome to sit at the AH table in that case imo.\n\nHe wants his cake and to eat it. problem is that if he benefits from your content and supports you then that means supporting you,\n\nif he had to choose between his AH family and you then he does. But he doesn't get to be mad that he does just because he cant support you privately anymore.\n\nall this says to me is he is happy for his benefits out of it and supports your autonomy just not publicly.", "Somewhere on the site should be a description of what the charge will appear as, it may be in the FAQ area or the Help/Support area, but sites of this nature almost always have a blurb about how things will appear on the monthly statement.", "Yes she is. Any member of the public can make an account and subscribe to her channel (for a fee.) That's public.\n\nPrivate would be making a sex tape intended just for yourselves.", "There's a commandment involving this, if I recall correctly....NTA he was gonna blackmail OP or just wanted to punish OP for blocking him and it backfired on him. Cut these people out", "The relationships are damaged because the BIL is horrible, dumb person (plus a few other negative adjectives). NTA. No apology needed. If he thought this was a serious issue, then a serious, adult conversation is in order - not some lame mind game. You\u2019re better off without that shit in your life. If you and your husband are solid, then let the rest of them stew in their own sanctimonious definition of good, Christian love.", "I always find censoring words like that the dumbest crap ever it's like people who censor the word m/rder, or the word or k/ll on Reddit post I even seen someone censor D/rkweb there's literally no point.", "It\u2019s still gross \ud83e\udd22", "This. He doesn\u2019t strike me as the type of man who could even fathom a spouse being ok with it.", "Right? That's not at all how you tell a family member that you found their adult content if you're concerned. My girlfriend used to post her adult content to Tumblr before 2018, and when her cousin had her blog recommended to him as someone might know, he just sent her a text saying \"Hey, just a reminder that Tumblr can recommend blogs based on email addresses in your address book\", and then they never spoke of it again (she wasn't thinking when she used her primary email, which her family uses, for her adult blog)", "Looking at porn makes you a sexual predator of the person starring in the porn?", "Yeah cuz if you dont then most social media will flag you you doofus. That\u2019s why people YT instead of white when referring to white people. \n\nReddit is more lenient with that but if a post isn\u2019t marked as NSFW and you used said words you just get warnings / an eventual ban \n\nEasy to find things dumb when you don\u2019t understand how it works init", "lol that\u2019s subjective", "I see what you mean. I agree he sees himself as superior in some way as he totally discounts others\u2019 feelings and well-being.\n\nIf it was from a position of genuine concern about the future of her soul or whatever he could easily have spoken to her about it without subscribing to her content, privately as well. Obvs she\u2019d still have the right to go \u201chard pass on this\u201d and feel uncomfortable with being asked at all but how he went about it felt like he just wanted to punish/humiliate her, like it\u2019s on another level. I\u2019m sure you agree that it was nasty etc so not trying to insinuate you think it\u2019s OK (you know how it can be on Reddit sometimes haha).", "Both are public.
