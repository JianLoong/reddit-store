They just had a birthday. I am an artist so decided I wanted to do a painting of a mashup of two of their favorite things. Well I am a college student, one of the classes is one of the most difficult classes my college offers so it has been taking up a lot of my time and energy. I am also disabled, I am always tired and in a lot of pain as well as very forgetful. I am also the primary manager of the home. I threw them a birthday party for all their friends, it was a good time, but I spent the majority of it cooking and running around cleaning up after their friends. Needless to say I was beat, but the party was on Saturday and their birthday was on Monday so I figure I had enough time to finish it. Nope, come Monday I was too tired and too busy to do it. I did take a couple lazy days for myself cause I have been feeling more under the weather than normal, then I had some very busy days with school and housework.\n\nThe problem is that at some point a few weeks ago I let slip that I was making them a present. They asked for it early twice, both times I said it was not ready. They asked for it on the day of their party, I said I was too busy setting up the party to finish it. They asked for it on their birthday I said it was taking longer than I wanted, but I would get it to them when it was ready. Then they brought it up two more times after that and I again reminded them that I would give it to them when it was ready.\n\nToday they mentioned what they were planning to get me for my birthday, a membership to get me free milkshakes all year, which is a really cool good deal, but I am allergic to milk and I am struggling to loose weight. They thought that was a good opportunity to ask again about their gift. At which point I was annoyed so I just said \u201cOh look it is time for me to\u2026\u201d about a video game I was playing, and I just kind of brushed it off and they responded by giving me the silent treatment.\n\nHonestly I am kind of pissed. I do not think a gift should be given, or art made, because the giver is being guilted and harassed to do it. Gifts and art should come from the heart. I am kind of hurt that they think a years supply of milkshakes is appropriate for me. I understand they have different values, but after I put so much thought into my gift for them I am surprised at their choice for me, also telling me ahead just ruins the surprise, which is beside the point but kind of sucks.\n\nAnyway, AITA cause at this point I don\u2019t even want to make the painting. I just want to buy the a cheap novelty item of the thing and move on with my life. Feels kind of passive aggressive? Also I am the one who took too long, a week late, and when I am not crazy busy I am vegging out, decompressing.\n\nTLDR: Roommates of a few months pressuring me for a handmade gift that I volunteered to do.
