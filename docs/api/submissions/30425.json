He is aware of how much I earn and we both earn quite the same amount( comfortable tech jobs) but we grew up in complete different circumstances. \n\nI grew up quite comfortably and that increased from my teen years as my fathers business was growing. So he has paid for mine and my elder brother\u2019s education ( bachelors and masters) in very good universities. Gave my brother money for his business and left me a house in my hometown and some funds for future emergencies. Whereas my husband grew up in a completely different situation where he had to do everything himself and support his parents as well. Like buying them a house and paying for their every expense. I was always proud of him for this. He is very responsible, paid for his bachelors, masters and while doing his PhD he bought a house for his parents and had some decent savings. \n\nWe pay for everything 50:50 like rent, utilities and vacations. I always tell him what I earn is our money but everything I got from my father is for the future as we plan on having a family. I am quite vague about how much money and property my father has left me as honesty I don\u2019t think he has anything to do with that. He is always very curious about it and keeps on telling me he spends more money where is always equal. my family never ask me money as they are more well of than me. On the other hand he pays for everything his parents needs. I have never said anything about it but if I spend my money for a massage or hair color he gets extremely angry.\n\nYesterday he asked about how much I have in savings so I told him half of what I have in savings ( excluding inheritance) and he got extremely angry and upset. I explained how it is and where I have spend like swimming lessons and scuba driving lessons. He was furious and stated yelling that what a horrible wife I am and how I never support him. I was extremely confused, he didn\u2019t ask for help he just asked for my savings. He kept on telling e I need to realize how I never support him and my spendings are ruining this marriage. I save half of my income and we both earn more than average. I have never asked him not to spend a large sum on his family. I am very very confused at this reaction. \n\nNote: I am a complete introvert. I received monetary support from my family for education and future security never for parting or spending recklessly. I worked during my collage days for as much as possible. For vacations I went home rather than somewhere fancy. So from an early age I am well aware of savings and investments.\n\nEdit: Before marriage I told him about my inheritance. That\u2019s mostly properties and emergency fund in my home country. When he asked casually how much savings I have I said the Amount I save from 50% of my own income. I excluded the bonuses and some monetary gifts from family mainly my brother and sister in law for holidays.\n\nUpdate: Yesterday he stopped taking to me after hearing how much I have saved . He said \u201c I need to realize my mistake \u201c, how I am ruining his life, I need to spend less. I tried to talk to him to clear things as I was very very confused. Just to see his reaction, I said \u201cI think you have misunderstood the situation, I have some money invested in shares.. and as that\u2019s not in the account that we can use immediate needs, I didn\u2019t mention \u201c. I was extremely shocked to see that his behaviour completely changed . He started saying sorry for his behaviour and suddenly my swimming lessons or hair color expenses didn\u2019t matter!

So NTA", "Oh honey, I hope you have a prenup.", "Your husband is pouring a large portion of his earnings into supporting his parents.  Why?  \n\nSounds to me like you kept quiet about your assets because you weren't sure it wouldn't affect your husbands behaviour and that you have been protecting yourself  for the future in case things didn't work out.  Or perhaps you didn't want to see a large portion of your assets going to his parents?\n\nYou might want to think about getting some legal advise to see where you stand should your relationship break down.", "NTA\n\nWhat I see is he's going to spend your money on his parents and then probably divorce you.", "NTA. That's your money, it's a very good idea for spouses to have their own pot of funds they can use just in case things go wrong. And judging by his reaction, I think you've done exactly the right thing. He's not angry that you lied, because you didn\u2019t - you've not been making yourself out to be poor or asking him for money to buy yourself things. He's angry because he feels entitled to your money and wants you to spend it on him.", "NTA, whenever men act like this when finding out about money, there\u2019s a reason and usually it\u2019s because they lack the same amount of resources and want to bleed you dry. \n\nI have never not once met a man who begrudges a woman having savings especially if she is contributing to the household. Your instincts told you to keep quiet for a reason.

Protect your assets.", "NTA\n\nHe's angry because you have more money than him.  But the two of you agreed to have separate finances so there's no reason you should have expected to give him anything from your income or family money.\n\nIt sounds like your husband can't afford to continue funding all of his family's expectations.  You could offer to go over his budget with him, and if you feel all of his expenses are necessary, perhaps offer him some financial help.", "NTA. It sounds like you contribute equally and spend your leftovers on what you want: you, savings and scuba diving and he, supporting his family.

So what changed?\n\nIts funny how money is often an uncomfortable subject between romantic partners. Like everything was never fleshed out and in the open before you married and now all of a sudden - it needs to be? What changed, is what I wonder? *Transparency is important to lots of us. I just wonder why it wasn't an issue before now?*\n\n I wouldn't feel comfortable telling my husband he can't help his family. But, I don't think I would deprive myself of simple beauty treatments like getting my hair done while he uses household resources to support adults, who don't even live in our home. I will do anything for my surviving parent. I do not ask my husband for money to do things for her though.\n\nIn my house, we started out with combined finances and my husband managed the money. It was what he wanted and I only agreed to try it because I knew it was the only way he would see how short sighted the plan was. He'd had a relationship with someone who was bad with money and he feared having to deal with that again. It took a little time to demonstrate that his management style actually failed to promote us actually making all decisions together. We moved from that to me paying in monthly to our household bills and having my old control of my earnings. (I think we had an argument about me buying myself new underwear that he hadn't preapproved or thought I needed that was the tipping point for me to shut the BS down?)\n\nAt any rate, we've morphed into that being the basic premise and anytime he says he needs more, I look at what's available and we move some money around to make sure everything is covered. Nothing I have is off limits to him. Nothing he has is off limits to me. \n\nMy only point is  that it takes time to practice money management styles and figure out what works between you. And I really can understand his wanting to know what all is in the pot. That makes sense to me. But, that doesn't mean he gets to control the pot and you need to ask for permission to spend money to get your toenails painted or your hair done.

Yes, YTA.", "You weren\u2019t fully honest. You didn\u2019t tell him your savings. It\u2019s not your obligation to pay for his parents expenses, but you should be upfront about your finances, this sounds deceptive. He also should not have called you a bad wife and stuff but he\u2019s clearly struggling to pay for everything and you\u2019re out getting massages and hair treatments. It\u2019s a bit selfish, you\u2019re meant to be partners and his family is your family too. By all means save your inheritance for the future, that\u2019s yours. But you lied about how much you actually have in savings and watch him struggle while pampering yourself. He shouldn\u2019t have blown up like he did, but you shouldn\u2019t have lied and kept your finances a secret. ESH, but more you than him.", "YTA. He's your husband.

I know I should not judge anyone and I haven\u2019t been in their shoes. But I have seen my parents work extremely hard without any inheritance or formal education.

Although he has spoken to my family but meeting them was different. He first mentioned monetary help during the wedding as my family paid for my half . He asked me to help him pay his half. Which I didn\u2019t mind. Then his father kind of started asking if I have all the assets sorted( my inheritance) when my father passed away. I wasn\u2019t in that condition to discuss it all but he seemed really worried. Like he would ask property values and I can discuss that with him. At some point I was really uncomfortable so I told him thank you for the concern but I will let my brother manage it for now as I am not in that condition and he already knows our lawyers and all. \n\nTo mention my brother is extremely wealthy and he made sure my father gives me everything in his will as he wanted my mother to live with him.

Emotionally I once said infront of them to my brother that when my nephew will be old enough I would want him to have our family home as he is the only grandkid my father ever saw. I cherished the memories of them playing in the house. It made my in laws very sad. I avoided as I lived far away and my husband never asked anything like that.
