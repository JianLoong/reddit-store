The difference between your situation and this one, is that Bart, seeing his teacher develop real feelings, decides to stop and let her down gently.\n\nYou're \"friends\" fucking suck, drop em. You get a whole new chance at college and then continuous chances for the rest of your life. No need to stay with people like that.", "If anyone asks, tell them the truth. That they catfished, humiliated, and bullied you. Trust me, everyone else will look at them with disgust.", "Don't let others label your emotions to better suit their needs.   \nYou get older and you make better friends, my best friend- I didn't meet her till I was 23 and we talk daily still to this day and I am 39.", "You\u2019ll be moving on soon, to college or whatever else you have planned and you\u2019ll have the opportunity to make so many better friends than these. These people are awful. Don\u2019t stay friends with them.", "im also a grudge holder, its so hard to forgive, and i definitely dont forget. i will be very hesitant in the future because of this :(", "can confirm i did not laugh", "It's a prank only if everyone has fun past the initial embarrassment. \n\nThis is harassment, catfishing, and down right cruel af to do to anyone.", "OP NTA. Those people aren't your friends. You deserve better than to be turned into the butt of many jokes by people you thought had your best interest at heart.", "I know I'm not OP, but I really needed to hear this, so thank you.", "All I'm saying is that only the OP will be able to judge whether they should dump long term friendships over what sounds like a one off incident. All the 'dump all your friends' comments seem drastic to me without more info. Presumably this person has known these people for years and I think you have to take the pattern into account.", "OP you asked for advice and you've had lots of it from others. I, at the same time, dont think you overreacted and also personally think you shouldn't dump long term friendships over this unless it's a pattern of behaviour or has revealed a nasty undercurrent in certain of your friends. It was a group prank and the 'getting out of hand' sounds right to me, although of course I was not there and can't tell.\n\nI say just chill and see where it goes and you are definitely entitled to be angry and should expect profuse apologies.", "all of these friends ive become friends with last year and this year, so we are still somewhat new. but its been frequent that most of my friend group picks on me. this type of behaivor isnt new, but this situation was taken way too far.", "True friends don't pick on each other.   They lift each other up and help you be the best you can be.   These people are not your friends.", "i forgot to mention by last year and this year i meant school years. i met them in my junior year and senior year of highschool. i am still a senior", "OK. Flipping my response. If these people are not long term and usually pick on you, others are right: drop them as the toxic people they are.1"]}
