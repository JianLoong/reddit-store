Those people will continue to make you an \u201ceasy target\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s hard but you need to let go of this \u201cfriend\u201d group and make some new ones. People who enjoy you and enjoy being around you without having to pick on you. A couple of really good friends are worth much more than a bunch of A-hole \u201cfriends\u201d. \n\nI wish you all the best!\n\nNTA", ">some of them had said im overreacting, and some say im making it a bigger problem than it needs to be. my family says i should drop them, but idk what to do. some people say im right for being upset, and im not overreacting.\n\n\nDrop them, drop them OP\n\nWhat would happen if they took it to a stage of asking you on a date and then they \"prank\" you by bailing out leaving you hurt. This is so tacky and selfish, drop them like a hot potato and say goodbye because it is only a joke if everyone is laughing.", "Drop them totally, they aren't your friends anyway.\n\nThe best advice you'll get:  Delete their contact info, and block anything that comes in.  I literally wouldn't say a word to any of them again, forever.", "NTA \n\n\n\nDrop them all", "NTA. this is so valid", "Your family is right, drop them. This is not friendship, this is bullying. So block them on discord, block them on social media, block them on your phone, and tell them if they actually want to do one nice thing for you after what they did to you, they can leave you alone.\n\nIf you are still school age, get school staff involved and inform them that you need help keeping them away from you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you didn't overreact, what they did was bullying and meant to humiliate and hurt you. Listen to your family and the people validating your feelings on this.", "Definitely NTA OP. I agree with others. They are not your friend. I know it hurts but leave them to fw someone else.!!", "NTA. True friends know not to joke something like that. Drop them like a hot potato. Who knows what kind of a joke they'll do next?", "NTA your friends hurt your feelings and don't care. You're not obligated to keep them in your friend group. Find some friends who care about you.", "NTA. I\u2019m really sorry this happened to you. I went through a similar situation in my senior year of high school and it was humiliating. I felt very isolated and most of my friends stopped talking to me/started bullying me when I stood up for myself. I know it might feel like the world is falling down around you, but I want to let you know that it will pass. There are more people to meet and more friends to make after high school. These people might realize how wrong this was, or they might not. Either way, it\u2019s important that you recognize your own worth and treat yourself with respect. I hope things turn out well for you!", "NTA - You're not overreacting.  These are shite friends.  Drop them.", "Why are people like this wtf, that\u2019s so awful, I\u2019m sorry op", "NTA. Are your friends teenagers? This seems out of a movie like mean girls! Such a mean thing to do. I would cut them off my life if I were you", "This is take-my-breath-away cruel. Your friends are terrible people and not your friends.   \nNTA I hope you find nicer people in your life (it shouldn\u2019t be hard, 99% of people would be nicer than this lot)", "That's horrible, a horrible thing to do.\n\nNTA. You will undoubtedly find better friends than them, and besides, it's better to not have friends than to have these people as friends.", "Nta. You need better friends. Real friends dont try to hurt & embarrass you. If a joke (this isn't a joke at all imo) hurts you, they are devastated that they caused it. These guys went in knowing this would cut you. They did it anyway. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your right. Find a new friend group", "NTA. I don't know who they were but 100% sure they are not your friends.", "NTA - dear God life was simpler in the 80s", "NTA \n\nDump these aholes at once.  They are not your friends", "NTA, none of these people are your friends, drop them like a bad smell and move on to greener pastures", "NTA - You deserve better. It\u2019s going to be weird seeing them at school since you\u2019re not friends anymore, but you\u2019ll get through it. My \u201cfriends\u201d in high school said so many horrible things about me behind my back and I had no idea until nearly a year after it started. It took me a while to heal and let go of the pain they caused. It\u2019s okay to be upset about it for a while, it takes time to heal, and you\u2019re doing the right thing by dropping them and moving on. It hurts now, but the older you get, these people won\u2019t matter to you anymore. OP, you will get through this. Don\u2019t worry. I believe in you and I wish you all the happiness in the world. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. You're encountering something that damn near everyone does as they get older: friendships change, and it's okay to realize that you have outgrown them. There are few more awful feelings than when people you like and feel close to decide to gang up and turn you into the communal joke. Time to move on, there are nice people you'll befriend who would be horrified at this story. Let the jerks find someone else in their group to tear down, it doesn't have to be you.", "NTA, what they did is *super* shitty.

Cut them off, they're not good friends at all.", "First thing that popped in my head: \u201cew that\u2019s gross - friends??\u201d They are not friends.", "depends on the friend group dynamic, some friend groups is normal to do insane stuff to each other, but only if it's reciprocated, etc. If this is normal prank behaviour that they do to each other and she may have engaged in the past, then YTA. But if it's not, which seems to be the case, then she's being bullied by her 'friends' and that means she has to drop them, NTA.", "Yeah this isn\u2019t even close to being funny, this is cruel.", "This experience, as painful and humiliating as it was, showed you who your real friends are. Hang on to them tight, and drop the rest, because they are not worth your time. Friends do not go out of their way to hurt friends and then blame the butt of their \"joke\" for being upset. They just want to keep you around to bully you some more.", "So glad to hear you have friends who support you. High school can be a tough place if you feel alone. Hang on to the ones who are there for you. \n\nOh. And you are most definitely NTA", "Exactly. OP, you are not sensitive, you are human. Humans have emotions. Particularly when people who are supposed to be your friends purposely go out of their way to hurt you. Don't ever feel bad about or apologize for having emotions.", "Totally agree with this.\n\nOP, you are 100% right in your reaction. It is reasonable to feel betrayed after the way they treated you.  Don't compromise your healthy sense of self-worth.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA.", "Thank you, I really appreciate that.", "I can understand your justifiable desire to be hesitant going forward, but make sure you don\u2019t place mistrust on people too soon who might actually be worthy of your time. The world has some really great and trustworthy people out there who will be delighted to be your friend. My advice would be to not be guarding yourself so well you forget to let the good ones in!", "I get the appeal of the group.  Had a situation at one point where I was friends with people who were part of a larger group and I got to attach myself when I was in town.  I wasn't one of the \"regulars\" but always appreciated having that experience.  \n\nThat said, if they'd pulled the kind of crap this group pulled, I'd have dropped them without any hesitation.\n\nYou will find your people if you keep yourself open to it, but also respect yourself enough not to settle.  You deserve better than you were getting.", "So, you're graduating in a few months anyhow?  That's great.  Focus on your studies - push to excel during the remaining months - and then get a fresh start.", "For the people who were directly involved, you need to move beyond \"probably\".  You should not trust them again, because they are not trustworthy.\n\nUnfortunately, where this is an interconnected group, that likely means moving on from everyone in it.  There might be an exception, if there are people who were not involved and who have been carefully not part of those memes in the past, but I think they might be both hard to identify and hard to keep as friends without becoming reinvolved with the larger, abusive group.", "Similarly, if anyone ever tells you you\u2019re \u201ctoo much\u201d, it\u2019s because they\u2019re not enough. Being a sensitive person with a wide range of feelings is a beautiful thing. We\u2019re gifted with feelings and understanding for so many things others can\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s a superpower, not a weakness. \u2728", "Same here", "Thanks for this I needed to hear this I've always been told I'm too much, especially by my mother", "I understand, sometimes I need to hear it too.
