That's just cruel and mean-spirited.  Maybe the ribbing in the restaurant was over-the-top but still at least intended in the spirit of friends giving each other shit.  But the catfishing afterwards which was shared even beyond the original group that was at the restaurant? That's downright hurtful and malicious.\n\nYou deserve better friends.

What I will add is this: It's going to stick, dropping your closest friends. Don't push down the emotions you feel around it. Cry, scream, get hugs from people who love you. Mourn those relationships, even as you move on.\n\nWhat they did to you was cruel. It'll take you some time to process that as well.

Say this out loud, \u201cI love and respect myself and it\u2019s ok to have healthy boundaries.\u201d\nThe fact that all your friends thought this was a great idea and also catfished you.. kinda implies they\u2019re emotionally immature ass holes and don\u2019t have any respect for you.

Don't listen to the person you're responding to. There's no excuse for this behavior."]}
