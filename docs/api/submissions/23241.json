He did it to himself and good on you for telling someone", "NTA The fact that other girls also find his behavior towards them creepy means he has a real problem. I am so sorry you had to go the extent of getting a ring to fend off persistent unwanted advances. And him finding your social without asking you is beyond creepy.", "NTA. That was really creepy and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with it.", "NTA at all, you don\u2019t blame the victim of creepy behaviour. I suspect he was fired because there is truth to your complaints and you weren\u2019t the first victim", "NTA. Anyway, he would complain even if you had spoken to him about his behavior.

Besides, you are most likely not the first one to bring up this type of behavior", "NTA and the title is misleading, it\u2019s not about a high five it\u2019s about inappropriate touching, including holding your hand, hugs and massaging your shoulders!", "NTA. I\u2019m pretty sure if you confronted him, he would\u2019ve gaslit the hell out of you and doubled down on his creepy. He needs to social distance the hell out of himself.", "NTA. Dude got himself fired.", "First off, you didn\u2019t get him fired for a high five, you got him fired for being inappropriate and creepy. You did the right thing.  The guy needs to be confronted about this but I totally get why you didn\u2019t. Safety first at all times. He knows damn well his behaviour is intimidating but he doesn\u2019t care. His comment is typical of the bully who uses the \u201cwhere\u2019s your sense of humour \u201c gaslighting response when confronted about misogynistic, homophobic  or racist comments You are NTA but he is exhibiting predatory behaviour so is much worse than an AH", "NTA - didn\u2019t few of the other women also agreed that he was making them uncomfortable? So it\u2019s not just you.", "NTA as someone who has worked at a hostel like that. The reason he was asked not to come back was because this WAS NOT the first/only offense of unwanted behavior. And his reaction to being talked to was NOT in line with working there. He's playing defense because he wants to keep being creepy there and the other spots. Word is going to get around now and he'll magically be not working in any of the hostels in the area probably soon. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Hopefully this will make him introspect.", "NTA.

You did what you needed to do to insure your safety.", "If he was just a guest at the hostel, thats one thing, they ask him to leave, he's goes and finds another place to stay, whatever.\n\nBut he's an employee? And thats how he behaves around the guests? You're nta in either scenario, but he needs to learn how to behave in a professional setting, even a super relaxed one", "He knew someone complained about his behavior, but he couldn't pinpoint who. That tells me that he has assaulted so many women that it would be a complete guess as to who it was. That's terrifying. \n\n\"Yeah, one of these uppity bitches complained about me touching them inappropriately!

NTA", "No you are not the asshole. NTA. All you know about this guy is that he's creepy af. He was fired for being creepy af, NOT for high fiving you. You probably aren't the only person who's complained about it. And why SHOULD you be expected to confront him? He wouldn't have admitted he was wrong, apologized, or stopped. He would've told you a bunch of bullshit about how you were taking it the wrong way/ being too sensitive, like that type of man ALWAYS does. He might have escalated, and you could've gotten hurt. It is the establishment's responsibility to make sure their guests feel safe and comfortable, and you were one hundred percent right to tell them that you didn't. They were right to get rid of him. Don't waste your time feeling sorry for him.", "NTA - unsolicited physical contact is DEFINITELY creepy. Don\u2019t doubt yourself. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA, one less creeper lurking around", "NTA.  He should have already known that his behavior was grossly inappropriate for a workplace.  Talking to him would have been useless at best, and possibly dangerous to you depending on his reaction.", "NTA, he should\u2019ve kept his hands to himself .", "NTA, and your title doesn\u2019t do the situation justice.  If he can\u2019t figure out it was you, then he\u2019s doing this to a lot of people.", "NTA- when most people get fired they blame others. tends to be the type of person that gets fired. Victims that have issues they are oblivious too. Joe is creepy", "NTA", "NTA. You 100% did the right thing.

This dude should've been fired a long time ago.", "NTA. And on behalf of others who you have potentially saved, thank you.", "NTA; even if Joe's actions were completely platonic and he's just an overly physical person it's Joe's employers who decided to let him go, maybe because he's had a history of issues, maybe because they overreacted and wanted to avoid any sort of harassment issue, whatever the case what you did in bringing it up was reasonable and responsible.\n\nBut Joe did not just 'high-five' you, what a click-bait title.", "NTA I guarantee you weren't the only one who reported or commented on this behavior.", "NTA - he got himself fired by acting like a creep. Who knows how he would have reacted if you confronted him, so talking to an employee was the right choice, imo. People like that can become unhinged when confronted, and your personal safety is much more important than his job. You have a right to travel without being harrassed and he needs to learn that he shouldn't be touching people and acting like a creep.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't get him fired for high-fiving you. \n\nHe got himself fired for repeatedly and consistently making female guests feel uncomfortable and/or unsafe. \n\nIt's unlikely that he got fired on the back of your conversation alone, but rather that it was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. He has likely been talked to about this sort of behaviour before and it hasn't made a difference.", "What a super misleading title you used. Obviously you are not an AH for reporting someone for harassment.", "NTA, title was misleading, \u201cCreepy guy kept touching me, so I got him fired \u201c.

He could have killed you, you never know with people.", "NTA.\n\nAll of those tropes give predator energy, the eye contact alone would be enough for most to call him out/say something to a member of staff.", "NTA.", "NTA but goddamn you sold yourself short with that title", " NTA. He knew exactly what he was doing and would only have gaslit you if you called him out. You\u2019d have either been accused of lying, leading him on or told don\u2019t flatter yourself. The fact they shifted him so fast tells me it\u2019s probably not the first time he\u2019s done this.", "Wtf is this title?", "NTA. The hugs, hand holding and the massages got him fired, not high fives. You did the right thing. A guy that terrible with common sense boundaries probably isn't going to react rationally to being told to stop by the person he's harassing.", "NTA. There's no way that was the only complaint, you should not feel badly.", "NTA, but your title sucks.  You didn't fire him for high-fives.  If bro high fived you once and moved on I don't think you would have thought twice about it.  You got him fired for continuously inappropriately touching you and borderline sexual harassment... It wasn'tthe high fives lol.", "NTA it's about time someone spoke up, give that other guests have the same complaints about him", "Fa, fo.\nNta", "YOU didn't get him fired. HE got HIMSELF fired. For being a creep and making people uncomfortable. It's called being held accountable for your actions.\n\nYou are definitely NTA. Good job letting the staff know it was time to take out the trash.", "NTA, misleading title tho. You got him fired for harassment and refusal to stop touching people.", "Honestly, more people need to take swift and decisive action to shut shitty behaviour down. Good for you! NTA", "NTA. He did this to himself. Also, when I travel, I wear a wedding ring as well. It does help keep down the number of creeps.", "NTA, he is a creeper.

He has gotten away with it this far because no one else came forward or not enough people.", "Nta he got his own ass fired", "It is unfortunate that they are just moving this creep to another location. You sure it isn\u2019t a church? /s not /s", ">While I stand by that his behaviour was creepy, I didn't intend to get him fired. \n\nWoman, screw what his situation is. The fact is that it's the consequence of his creepiness and his sexual harassment that he has done not only to you but to other girls. I seriously don't know how you can't ascertain what's been happening to you as sexual harassment, but I'll let it pass this time, with the hope you have now understood the telltale signs from your experience. NTA x 1000, and while I would've hoped you'd confronted him or reported it directly, it nevertheless was fruitful.
