Put them in their place.   \n\n\nAs someone who works In Alzheimer\u2019s support and who has a father with Alzheimer\u2019s, I implore you to accept all the help you possibly can. Caregiving is grueling and burnout is high. There is a real risk of caregivers having severe health problems or dying before their person. Please reconsider bringing in professionals who understand the disease and who can provide respite. Your family does not have to do everything.   \n\n\nMy heart is with you.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your oldest son and family are doing a real service to you and your wife and your in turn are providing the necessary space for them to live with you. \n\nCan't believe the younger son is even having an issue with this. He can find somewhere else to stay when he visits if he doesn't like what you're offering.", "I think your son is out of order, so NTA.  \n\nBut unsolicited advice, get some help outside the family. I cared for my sick mother and I\u2019m still getting over it almost 10 years after her death. It was a labor of love, but my mental health has been damaged by the experience.", "NTA but you need to get over that \"no strangers in my house\" nonsense.  At some point, as the disease progresses, you won't be able to provide proper care for her. Plus, you're going to burn out. Your model isn't sustainable long term.", "NTA", "Eh, what? I grew up in a small house and my (tiny) room was converted into a bigger bedroom for my middle sister (previously I had to pass through hers, which was also tiny, to get to mine) as soon as I moved out. \n\nThen when middle sister moved out, my youngest sister, who was living in the downstairs winter garden as her \u201croom\u201d (she had a proper door though), got the upstairs bedrooms and the winter garden became a dining room again. \n\nWhen she moved out it all went to my parents, who up until then had the same two tiny rooms as my sisters and I to share between them. One used to be completely filled up with the double bed and wardrobe, the other a mini office with desk and bookshelf (mum was a teacher so had to do a lot of work at her desk at home). They kept one of the small rooms for guests, the office remained where it was and they now finally have a proper sized bedroom upstairs. \n\nAny of us will always be welcome to come and visit and crash wherever there is space - guest bedroom, living room sofa (in the open plan kitchen) or at my grandparents\u2019 flat next door (they\u2019ve loads of space tbh). \n\nBut neither of us would ever be so delusional to expect to have a room reserved for us when we come and visit. And that\u2019s without one of us having moved our family in to help care for our mum. What a selfish thing to expect when your older son is sacrificing is time to be an unpaid carer. \n\nNTA.", "Not what you asked, but your paranoia about \"having a stranger at my home\" is creating a huge disruption in the lives of both your sons. It's grossly unfair to put so much responsibility onto your children, simply because of an ungrounded fear on your part.

Consider getting yourself some therapy, so that you can accept the normal situation of having home nursing help, and release your younger son and his family from the obligation they have felt compelled to take on.", "NTA, and what a ridiculous request on his part", "NTA - All the rooms are taken by permanent residents, if they want to visit they have to take what's available or get a motel nearby. Now, if they were moving in permanently some rearranging could be done, but in this case they should be happy with what they're given. \n\nWhether or not they're helping with your Wife is not the most relevant thing to me though. While it's amazing that your oldest son has stepped up to the plate to help you I don't think it's something that could have been automatically expected, and your younger son being unable to help doesn't make him a bad person.", "NTA.

If you refuse to compromise, they will just stop showing up, all you are doing is pushing your younger son away.", "NTA. Your comment was spot on, and I'm sorry your youngest son is a jerk (although pleased that he does visit). The living room is cheaper than a motel, and that's always an option.", "NTA. There\u2019s really nothing more to add, other than stick to your guns.", "Your children are under no obligation to help you or their mother. That's not their job. If you've built good relationships with your kids they will want to help if they can. It's amazing that one son has not only the ability to help but also wants to, and his family is okay with it. You haven't explained why the other son didn't do the same. It's not unreasonable for the kids to share temporarily, or have the kids do a living room sleepover as others suggested, or for him to ask.  You're taking your one son for granted, acting like it's his duty and responsibility to help bc you \"don't want a stranger\" helping. You know how you make someone not be a stranger? Get to know them. And disregarding the other bc he can't or won't help, but it's clearly still coming to visit.

Elderly UTIs, as an example, have completely different symptoms compared to healthy younger adults and can fly under the radar if you don't want to know what to look for, especially if she can't tell you herself properly how she's feeling. The only symptoms my mom had was the fact that my grandma with dementia was suddenly more mean and confused than usual, and my mom dismissed it as just part of her disease progression.

I think that is very thoughtful of you to give your one adult son and his children their own space because they\u2019re there helping you and your wife.", "YTA\n\nYour wife needs an actual nurse. Crowding both of your sons' families into where they are sleeping in the living room is absurd", "YTA\n\nThis is a difficult situation but you're being unfair.\n\nYou criticize him for not helping - but you can afford outside help. You just don't want it. \n\nYou criticize him for not helping - but ensure his family is underfoot and uncomfortable when they come visit.\n\nImo it's very normal for kids to share a room when you have guests. So it's weird that you think this is some huge imposition.\n\n\"You are just a guest you should be grateful\" - like that's just rude and great way to ensure he doesn't visit. \n\nIt would be different if you couldn't afford help but it seems like you are punishing him for a choice you're making. I understand this must be difficult but it's an unfair burden to take on or put on your family entirely. \n\nI know my parents are going to great lengths to ensure they are never a burden to me even tho I would happily provide as much care as I can altho with lots of support. They've been explicit in their wills, they have discussed all kinds of plans, especially medical, bc they know it's hard and it's unfair to put the burden on your children entirely. My mom worked in geriatrics and pretty much ensured my grandmother was happy and healthy until nearly 101 - but she did not live with us or attempt to provide all care herself. \n\nAnyhow I think you need to consider your expectations and separate them from what's fair to impose and judge your sons on.", "For all of you wanting OP to play musical beds here, stop.

He said her routine was upset and it kicked off delusions, paranoia, and caused her a great deal of distress. \n\nIt was so bad that she would freak if her shirts were not hung up in the correct order in her closet.
