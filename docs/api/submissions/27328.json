Upon returning to our apartment, it became apparent that our friend had rushed through the task without checking whether the plants needed water. It seemed that each time our friend came over, they added more water, eventually leading to most of the plants being overwatered.   \n\n\nWhen we got back, we discovered that many of the plants were drowning in water (so bad that they had to be thrown away), and one placed on a wooden table had suffered so much that it even caused waterdamage to the table itself, leaving a significant dark mark. When we confronted our friend about this, their response was, \"I watered your plants according to your plan, and the plant was on the table. You told me to come every 4th day.\" However, we never specified a strict schedule; we asked them to come once or twice to check on the plants.  \n\n\nLater, we found out that our friend had been away for 7 days, which meant they also lied about following a 4-day schedule. While our friend seemed to feel a bit guilty about the situation, they never followed up to see what they could do about the damaged table. In our shoes, we would have promptly offered to replace or at least contribute towards a new table.  \n\n\nAfter attempting to find someone to repair the table and receiving responses indicating it wasn't possible, I reached out to our friend and explained that we had to buy a new table. Their response was, \"What do you want me to do about it?\". I replied that I couldn't dictate their actions, but we would have appreciated it if they had taken the initiative to contribute to replacing the table without us having to ask. Subsequently, they Venmoed the money but unfriended us on social media, and their girlfriend did the same. This is a friend from a long time, and this friend is also not very cautious about other peoples stuff. Eventhough they did us a favour, in our opinion, you need to be cautious about other peoples belongings.\n\nIn this situation, we're left wondering if we're in the wrong.

It may be moving the plants to somewhere where it doesn't matter if the overflow..  or look at longer term watering solutions.  You may find that you can group plants.  The ones that will be fine without water in one area that no one touches.  The ones that can be very wet in the bath or shower where it doesn't matter if the water overflows.  And for the other ones there can be drip irrigation systems that use a bottle and a delivery device.  Obvious best if there's only a few plants that require it.", "ESH.", "YTA.

Ppl help friends to move and smthg breaks - thats the reason why at least in my country private liability insurances have a clause that allows you to let them regulate a damage out of curtesy if from a legal pov they wouldn't have to pay.

I have one plant this isn't possible on, so I make sure I water it when I'll be here for a while and can check it after an hour or so to make sure I don't need to clean up any overfill.
