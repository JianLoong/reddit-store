Upon returning to our apartment, it became apparent that our friend had rushed through the task without checking whether the plants needed water. It seemed that each time our friend came over, they added more water, eventually leading to most of the plants being overwatered.   \n\n\nWhen we got back, we discovered that many of the plants were drowning in water (so bad that they had to be thrown away), and one placed on a wooden table had suffered so much that it even caused waterdamage to the table itself, leaving a significant dark mark. When we confronted our friend about this, their response was, \"I watered your plants according to your plan, and the plant was on the table. You told me to come every 4th day.\" However, we never specified a strict schedule; we asked them to come once or twice to check on the plants.  \n\n\nLater, we found out that our friend had been away for 7 days, which meant they also lied about following a 4-day schedule. While our friend seemed to feel a bit guilty about the situation, they never followed up to see what they could do about the damaged table. In our shoes, we would have promptly offered to replace or at least contribute towards a new table.  \n\n\nAfter attempting to find someone to repair the table and receiving responses indicating it wasn't possible, I reached out to our friend and explained that we had to buy a new table. Their response was, \"What do you want me to do about it?\". I replied that I couldn't dictate their actions, but we would have appreciated it if they had taken the initiative to contribute to replacing the table without us having to ask. Subsequently, they Venmoed the money but unfriended us on social media, and their girlfriend did the same. This is a friend from a long time, and this friend is also not very cautious about other peoples stuff. Eventhough they did us a favour, in our opinion, you need to be cautious about other peoples belongings.\n\nIn this situation, we're left wondering if we're in the wrong.

In one of your last sentences, you indicate you knew this friend was not careful about other people's stuff, yet you gave them free reign.They did the favor you asked. Yes, ideally, they would have suggested a contribution toward replacing the table, but clearly \"stuff\" isn't important to them. You prioritized your stuff over your friendship by making this a big deal. I have a feeling each time you look at your new table, you'll think about your lost friendship.", "YTA.   \nDid you tell them how much to water? When? A crash course in testing the moisture level of the pot plant? You don\u2019t say you did any of this\u2026   \nDid you pay them for their help? What were they getting out of this? \n\nYou knew he wasn\u2019t careful with people\u2018s stuff\u2026 but still you got him in for your plants\u2026?  \nIt sucks they screwed up, but if you hire an incompetent person, don\u2019t train them, and don\u2019t pay them\u2026 you can\u2019t really ask for them to pay for accidental damage they cause. I\u2019d pay you some money and unfriend you too. The money isn\u2019t for the table, it\u2019s to give you no further avenue for complaints/shut you up.", "YTA - your friend was doing you a favor, I think they dont have a green thumb and/or you weren\u2019t clear about what needed to be done. If there was a strict schedule, etc you should have been more clear about that. \n\nLetting them know they did a bad job was fine, but wanting them to contribute to replacing a table was unnecessary and may have seemed like you trying to grab a brand new table for free because of their mistake", "YTA\n\nNot everyone knows that water can ruin a wood table believe it or not. If you had a plant sitting on a wooden table without a leakproof drip tray underneath it that is the problem. Not your friend. Apologize and please don\u2019t expect him to contribute to you buying a new table. Not to mention you ruined a good friendship and still obviously feel like you were wronged here. Be adults, take him and his girlfriend out to drinks or dinner, apologize for being the AH\u2019s that you so obviously are and give him his Venmo money back. Good friends are hard to come by, fix this while you can.", "YTA.\n\nYour friend was doing you a favour. It's your job to clarify how the plants should watered. You cannot just assume they have this knowledge. Especially when you choose to place the plants on a wooden table.\n\nPlease do not ask anymore friends to do you favours in the future because you'll just end up without any friends left. You're definitely the asshole.", "YTA- an entitled one at that. Someone does you a favor but doesn\u2019t do it the way you wanted it, or expected it, or to your standards and now they owe you a table? \n\nFurthermore, if this friend is \u201cnot very cautious about other people\u2019s stuff\u201d why would you ask them for the favor in the first place? Also, why would you put the plants over a wood table that could be ruined knowing someone who isn\u2019t as careful as you would be taking over? Seems like you knew the risks and still asked and when it didn\u2019t work out, your first thought was \u201cbuy me a new table\u201d", "I don\u2019t think anyone is the asshole here. You left the plant on the table, and you know he\u2019s not a careful person, that was asking for trouble. \n\nRegarding him not sticking to your schedule, it sounds like you are saying he came both more frequently and less frequently so I\u2019m a tad unclear. But sadly, when you are asking someone to do a favour that is out of their way, and the timing is not super important (it\u2019s not as if they were coming to feed a pet), you have to expect they\u2019ll come when it suits them so long as it\u2019s close enough. \n\nAlso with watering plants it is really hard to know how much/little to water them. I have indoor and outdoor plants and I kill them all the time even though I\u2019m desperately trying to keep them alive. Some people don\u2019t have a green thumb. \n\nI think you were expecting too much from someone that you know caring about others\u2019 possessions is not his strong suit.", "YTA\n\nIf you want a professional service hire a professional with Insurance. \n\nWhen you ask for a favour from a friend don't expect them to pay for mistakes", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu can discuss compensation up to HALF of what you paid them to take care of your plants.", "They are not cautious about other people's stuff.\n\nThey were doing you a favour. \n\nThey did the job badly - as disappointing as their efforts were I would not have asked for the money.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

Unless it was a veneer, it probably could have been fixed.", "I understand why you're upset, but YTA:\n\n>this friend is also not very cautious about other peoples stuff\n\nWhy did you ask them then? Did you think they would suddenly become careful?\n\n>our friend had rushed through the task without checking whether the plants needed water\n\nPeople who don't have plants don't know anything about caring for them, I assume this was the case here.\n\n>we would have appreciated it if they had taken the initiative to contribute to replacing the table without us having to ask\n\nSorry but this just sounds very pompous. I hope you didn't actually say it like this.\n\n>they Venmoed the money but unfriended us on social media\n\nUnfortunately you didn't think through the consequences of a. Asking this person to water your plants b. Blaming them for the damage and C. Asking them to pay for your table. It's quite understandable that they are pissed about the whole situation.\n\nMy suggestion is that you apologise and return the money, and in future don't ask people for favours and expect a professional service.", "YTA. You say you knew your friend was not someone who is cautious of other people's stuff, yet you asked them for a favor in your home (which you seem particular about) while you were away, and expected them to be cautious of your stuff. I have dozens of plants all over my house and would never even ask my partner to water them because I know how easy it is to overflow the saucers. I also know that he is someone who doesn't pay very close attention to such details. If I asked him to do it and ended up with water everywhere, that would be on me.", "YTA\n\nYour friend did you a massive favour.  Most people don't know that plants can be overwatered or that water can damage what's underneath the plant.. whether that be your wooden table or if there is carpet where the water overflows onto that.\n\nYour friend is not that smart if the soil was still wet when they added more water but if they don't have houseplants of their own they wouldn't have had a clue.\n\nNext time find a different solution.  It may be moving the plants to somewhere where it doesn't matter if the overflow..  or look at longer term watering solutions.  You may find that you can group plants.  The ones that will be fine without water in one area that no one touches.  The ones that can be very wet in the bath or shower where it doesn't matter if the water overflows.  And for the other ones there can be drip irrigation systems that use a bottle and a delivery device.  Obvious best if there's only a few plants that require it.", "ESH.", "YTA. You ask your friend to water your plants and instead of a thank you, it\u2019s a fuck you, pay me.", "YTA. You know that your cactus needs 25 mL of water per week, but other people don't. So... you had the responsibility of creating a list of water needs with actual measurements to get someone else to do something properly.", "ESH\n\nThen for the alleged neglect, you for your attitude about it all. I\u2019m unsure how to describe it, but your writing style makes you come off unlikeable.", "NTA.  But why ask someone who isn\u2019t careful with other\u2019s possessions to come into your home at all?  You should\u2019ve bought those watering products for when you travel or asked a more responsible friend and paid them.  You took the tthe cheaper option and got burned.", "I don't understand all the Y T A votes here. It's pretty simple to know not to drown a plant, especially to the point it's overflowing onto a wooden table. And who doesn't know water + wooden furniture = bad?!\n\nThe friend displayed no care and lied to boot, they should have offered to chip in on the repair of the table once it was known it was damaged from their neglect. That's basic decency.\n\nThat said, the table can probably be sanded back and revarnished to fix the water mark, and OP shouldn't have asked someone known to not care about other people stuff to look after their stuff.\n\nNTA but bordering on E S H", "NAH you asked a friend to water & they did. Not everyone knows how to care for plants. You should have give. Them better directions.", "NTA - sounds like a super strict schedule for the plants and if they couldn\u2019t do it they should have just said no in the first place. You trusted them, they broke your trust and caused damage. They are in the wrong. Now they\u2019re too stubborn to even apologise and willing to throw the friendship away over it. You\u2019re better off without them.", "NTA. When you agree to house sit, babysit, pet sit....you take on the responsibility of whatever it is you're caring for. Doesn't matter if that thing is alive or not. Of you kill it, you're responsible. If you break it, you're responsible. \n\nI will say, in the future, be more selective over who you ask to care for your home/plants while away.", "Nta.
