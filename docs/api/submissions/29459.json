Since I'm the only one working right now, I have asked him to keep the house clean but, when I arrive home from work every night, most of the time he's done nothing all day. It's rare that he'll even lay out the meat for dinner when I ask him to. IF he gets up at a decent hour, he'll do the dishes. It's starting to feel like he's using me as an ATM and a nanny so that he doesn't have to do anything for his daughter. I love him and I love her and I'm afraid that if I leave him, he'll take her from me and that would crush us both. I have talked, nagged, ignored, yelled, and, cried to him about this situation and he has done nothing to significantly change. Frankly, it's starting to feel like he doesn't care about me at all.

I get a slight feeling in my stomach like there\u2019s something wrong with me because I left my ex 3 years ago and have only gone on a couple first dates and am not currently dating at all. It always starts out like \u201cmy new life is so much better and my new partner is amazing and we are so in love\u201d and I think \u201cGee, what\u2019s so bad about me that I don\u2019t have that?\u201d\n\nThen\u2026inevitably, I read the next sentence which is ALWAYS along the lines of \u201cbut he has no job, he\u2019s an asshole, he lives in my home rent-free, I do all the housework and errands, and he contributes absolutely nothing but his dirty ass crack. How can I change him?\u201d Oftentimes there\u2019s also abuse mixed in.\n\nAnd then I remember why I chose to stay single so I can focus on growth and healing and my child.\n\nListen - take some time to be single and reflect on why you keep choosing men that who have absolutely nothing to offer and who don\u2019t respect you, and why you don\u2019t immediately end it when they start showing you their true colors. This has nothing to do with this specific guy. This is something within *you* where you believe you\u2019re not worth being treated well and that it\u2019s normal for your partner to be a childish, selfish deadbeat, and where you talk yourself out of taking red flags seriously, perhaps because deep down you think this is all you can get, or perhaps you think a loser is better than being alone. Whatever your specific beliefs and their source, you have to figure it out and be conscious of it, then decide you want something different. When people say \u201cstay single for a while\u201d, they don\u2019t mean just stay single and stare at a wall. They mean do some work and self-reflection to understand your patterns and their causes, and then some more work to shift your mindset and attitude towards relationships. Otherwise you\u2019ll just blindly repeat this cycle to the end of time. \n\nAlso, just a tip - when you\u2019re like this with men and have trouble with boundaries (I was and I did), set very harsh ones for yourself. This way, when you inevitably bend them a little, it will still be within a reasonable range rather than allowing someone to take complete advantage of you. People who have better self-esteem and relationship patterns don\u2019t need rules like this, but they also have a sense of balance in a relationship rather than holding on for dear life and can end things when they\u2019re being mistreated. So, some examples of hard rules you could set for your protection are (and I\u2019ve set all of these): \n\n- Don\u2019t let a man move in with you unless you\u2019re married, the place is in both your names, and he\u2019s going to be paying the rent or mortgage. Don\u2019t marry him until he\u2019s proven he can support himself (and you if you want or need that) and can be depended on and trusted 100% of the time - this takes minimum one year and often longer. Two years to be safe (very few people can play a part for two years and show zero red flags). \n\n- Don\u2019t pay a dime for a man until you\u2019ve been with him a long time and he\u2019s paid for you (or at the very least fully supported himself and paid for himself when you guys spend time together every single time) up until then, and even then, never fully support him (barring illness or other extreme circumstances and that should only be if you\u2019re married). \n\n- Don\u2019t let a man with a kid treat you like the other parent unless you\u2019re married and he\u2019s already improved your life significantly (emotionally, physically, spiritually, financially, whatever). \n\n- Do NOT make excuses for him. If you see a red flag, do not sweep it under the rug or talk yourself into being ok with it. If you\u2019re unsure whether it\u2019s a red flag, ask the most practical, level-headed friend or family member you have.\n\n- Totally ignore any word that comes out of a man\u2019s mouth for the first year - ONLY look at his actions. If those actions don\u2019t make your life better and easier and happier, get rid of him - does not matter what excuses he makes (or you make for him). Assume whatever actions he\u2019s taking will not change, or that they will get worse. Bad character and bad behavior almost never improves, and you don\u2019t want to gamble on that. You don\u2019t need to.\n\n- Don\u2019t assume you know what a man is like until at least a year has gone by - some men are good at hiding their true nature for a while. You should not make any kind of serious commitment in less time than that. If he has children and is pushing them to see you as a parent sooner than that, think hard about whether he has good judgement.\n\n- Most important of all, remember that it\u2019s much, much better to be single forever than to be trapped with a loser, abuser, or deadbeat. There is no contest between the two, and no case where that\u2019s not true. This is key - when you stop feeling like you *have* to have someone (or have this specific person), and you realize that it\u2019s better to be alone until someone comes along that is actually an improvement to being alone, your life will change.\n\nIf you set hard rules like this, then you can bend them a little (a little!!) and it\u2019s not a big deal. But it\u2019s really important for women like us to have these rules because our sense of what\u2019s healthy is broken or was never developed in the first place. Also, do not date at all until you get to a place where you are comfortable with these kinds of rules and understand why you need them - you should not be grasping onto and rushing into things with anyone when you have this kind of track record.", "NTA what exactly is he bringing to your relationship besides more bills, more responsibilities, & more chores?

It's starting to feel like he's using me as an ATM and a nanny so that he doesn't have to do anything for his daughter. I love him and I love her and I'm afraid that if I leave him, he'll take her from me and that would crush us both. I have talked, nagged, ignored, yelled, and, cried to him about this situation and he has done nothing to significantly change. Frankly, it's starting to feel like he doesn't care about me at all. So, WIBTA if I kicked him out until he did some growing up?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You'd be justified to kick him out but it probably makes a little more sense to try and find out what is going on to cause the change from the start of your time together till now. Not that you have an obligation, but if he was acting in an acceptable way a few months ago and now he's different than it seems likely that something has caused a change in behavior.\n\nDoes he have a desire to have a career? Perhaps he's slipped into a bout of a depression over not having a job or something else. Not making excuses and again you'd be well within your rights to ditch him but at the same time if you love the person enough to marry them it's probably not the worst idea to explore what is going on before breaking it all off.", "his mask fell off. this is a huge blanket of marinara\u2026 not just a flag. \n\nactions speak louder than words.", "Ever heard the term hobosexual?", "INFO Did he propose with a ring?

Your journey of self-discovery wasn't complete and you need a more experienced guide.   You were happy because you were looking at things through rose-colored glasses.
