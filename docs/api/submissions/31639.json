I serve, I host, and I do typical restaurant things and make whatever hourly wage is attached to the position I\u2019m scheduled to work for.\n\nOne of my coworkers, Lucy, approached me the other day to ask if I\u2019d like to take part in a gift exchange she\u2019s organizing between the employees and managers of the restaurant.  I agreed without giving much thought into asking any questions.  I\u2019ve been a part of gift exchanges before and I assumed it wouldn\u2019t be much different than always.  I just expected the price would be like $20 minimum or something.\n\nYesterday, I noticed my coworkers were writing wish lists for things and some of the items they wanted were INSANE.  Like, someone requested a PS5, while others wanted expensive cologne or perfume.  I thought it was a joke and asked Lucy about it, which was how I learned the minimum price of the gift we\u2019re supposed to get is $50 or more.  I was shocked and asked if I heard her right as well if she was sure it wasn\u2019t $15 or $20, to which she looked at me with a look of confusion and annoyance while saying \u201cyou can\u2019t buy a good gift for that little money\u2026\u201d  I thought I was crazy.  I mean, I\u2019d love a PS5, but getting one for free?  Especially from someone who barely knows me or probably spent their entire paycheck on it?  No way.  Plus, the person I was assigned to buy a gift for is a new supervisor I haven\u2019t even met or spoken to yet.  All I know is that he likes whiskey.  Definitely not someone I\u2019d feel generous enough to spend $50 or more on.\n\nI\u2019ve told my family and they\u2019re insisting I drop out. My sister was shocked, saying that her company\u2019s gift exchange\u2019s minimum price is like $10 and her job makes $500 more a week than I do.  Many of my coworkers also suggested I drop out, informing me that Lucy is well-off and doesn\u2019t understand how much $50 is to many of us and that I\u2019m one of the only permanent employees who\u2019s signed up because they all can\u2019t afford $50.  I feel like a jerk for considering dropping out, but I can\u2019t afford to spend that much and I doubt whoever I\u2019m assigned to will be as generous.\n\nAm I in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1700838502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182u5hd/wibta_if_i_dropped_out_of_my_works_gift_exchange/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As long as you haven't drawn names yet it should be fine. \n\nI think stuff like this needs to be based on what the lowest paid staff members are comfortable with and yes, $15 or so is about right. It's not normally about getting good' gifts, it's a bit of fun.", "Definitely NTA!!  I work in a corporate environment and I'm probably one of the lower paid employees and still make a significant amount, yet our \"Secret Santa\" has a MAXIMUM upward limit of $50, not the MINIMUM!  It is ridiculous to put a minimum so high and have no cap!  What are they expecting?  What if someone does go and buy another employee a PS5 and then they get a $50 gift in return, don't you think they'll be upset??  Your company needs to put a max on gift amounts... and it certainly shouldn't start at $50!!!", "Christ on a cracker, that's insane. NTA if you decline.  The assholes is Lucy.", "Seriously, when we had a gift exchange at work (minimum wage job) it was a max of 15 euros. And I'd most of the time just gift them something silly like a santa's hat filled with scratchers. Or I'd find out what shops they like and give them a voucher for that. You know, something useful but not too personal given they're just coworkers you have shallow relationships with.", "NTA. Shouldn't there be a max cap as well? A PS5 for a work gift exchange seems excessive.", "NTA - it's not in the spirit of these gift exchanges that they be expensive. You can absolutely drop out with a clear conscience. \n\nMaybe your clueless colleague will learn something about how to organise an office gift exchange. (The clue is in the name: it's an exchange, not a grab.)", "NTA - I don\u2019t even spend \u00a350 minimum for friends/family or my kids as I simply can\u2019t afford it.. having that as a minimum for a random coworker is just insane.\n\nSecret Santa is usually \u00a35-10 maximum as it\u2019s supposed to be a bit of fun (usually end up with something edible or a cheap, tacky keepsake gift).. their actual friends/family, etc can get them gifts they actually want if they\u2019re going to request expensive stuff", "NTA, but be prepared for everyone else to have opinions about it, those who didn\u2019t drop out. $50 minimum is ridiculous. If anything, $50 should be the maximum, although that\u2019s still pretty high for a work exchange.", "NTA- I would decline participating. The person that picked your name, can have the name you picked.  I am glad I work for a company with specific gift giving policies. A gift exchange is not allowed, nor is a gift to a person at a higher position.", "NTA.  Unless your are friends on the outside, $50 (minimum!) is way too much for a company exchange.  I've had very successful ones at under $20.", "That's ridiculous, I don't spend that on some of my family!!!!", "NTA but I think you might have to suck it up as you were already assigned a person. If not then drop out.", "YTA - As with all cases, you should had asked the values of the mystery gift before signing in. You leaving now, will usually means one person will not get their gift, despite gifting one, which goes against the spirit of the mystery gifts.\n\nYes, 50$ is a lot, and if you want to quit, you have to be clear with the host, maybe there is another person who also wants to quit and then the host can \"reshuffle\" the draws that were meant for you.\n\nAgain to be clear, it's not the act of quitting that makes you the TA, it's accepting without knowing the rules and then complaining about the rules and quitting after the draw, making a whole load of trouble for the organizers.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lucy isn't reasonable.", "I\u2019ve never had a gift exchange that had a minimum price, they have all had maximum price and sometimes it\u2019s hard to get the gift under that amount. Usually it\u2019s 25-30 maximum.", "NTA.  Tell her SOON, that you simply don't have it.  You can't get blood out of a stone. \n\nSeriously.  $50??   I barely spend that on my family, and I LOVE them!", "That's appallingly ignorant to expect so much. YWNBTA.

A $50 minimum for a coworker gift exchange is IMO too much.  I make good money and I would never spend $50 on someone that I don\u2019t know or that I don\u2019t like.  $20-25 would be it for me. \n\nWho in their right mind would ask a coworker for a PS5? The same person who would give a gift that costs $49.99. \n\nAnd Lucy is wrong you can buy a \u201dgood\u201d gift for $15-20.  \n\nTell Lucy that you are not going not participate and to remove your name.", "ESH - I think you should have asked, not made assumptions. Yes maybe it's a reasonable assumption, but it's still an assumption. I take part in these at work and through Reddit and other places from time to time, and I never agree to joining in and getting matched until I know all the requirements and know the important details like minimum and maximum spend, mail-by dates, etc. \n\nYou're only mildly at fault, and only for making assumptions. And the real question is now is there someone to take your spot or is this new manager going to get unfairly passed over?\n\nYour coworker is a bigger AH for the entitlement and setting so high a minimum in the first place.  That was never in question.", "Wtf - I\u2019m running my department\u2019s and it\u2019s a $30 max in an office where we aren\u2019t making bank but not minimum wage either\n\nNTA", "The handful of gift exchanges I have done at work all\u00e1 has MAXIMUMS IN THW $35-45 range...

Most are 10 minimum, 20 max. \nI even did one once where it was tiered.  You could sign up for 10 and under,  10 to 20, 20 to 30. You could only draw from that tier so no one was mismatched.  It was very cool,  just more work for the ladies organizing it.", "She said she\u2019s already got her giftee name, which means names have been drawn - but if she acts fast, she can tell Lucy she\u2019s dropping out, find out who has her name, and give them the name she was assigned (fingers crossed it\u2019s not the same person who she has!)", "Before I even knew the minimum, the things I was considering putting on a wishlist wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near $50, even if you added them all together.\n\nLike a cute sketchbook (I draw and do a lot of art), pens and markers, or something\u2026you know\u2026INEXPENSIVE.  Now I feel like if I did participate, I\u2019d have to ask for something expensive too just to make the exchange worth it to myself and I just don\u2019t have that interest.  I\u2019m not crazy, I know expensive things are something you get from people you love, not a coworker.", "The exchange doesn\u2019t happen until December 17th so if I did drop out now, there\u2019ll probably be enough time for Lucy to figure something out.   I\u2019m sure the worst that\u2019ll happen is that Lucy will probably see me as cheap, but I\u2019m not the only employee who\u2019s dropped out because of the price minimum.", "My last job did something where you got small little stuff every day for the week as a surprise in your office. One day it might be candy, the next day it might be some pens (we wrote a lot), the 3rd day it might be a small gift card to Starbucks and then Friday you revealed who you had. You made a list ahead of time of all your favorite things. It was kind of fun having to sneak into someone\u2019s office when they weren\u2019t there.", "No one is saying you need to follow the wishlists. I'd try to find out what your supervisor likes (use the wishlist as a guideline) and give something from that within your budget.   \nAnd stick to the cheaper things on your wishlist. If supervisor whines, he will probably get you something from your wishlist so the budget between the two of you should be around equal level then. \n\nNext year you can clarify about the budget first before commiting yourself.", "Drop out, say sorry it\u2019s not in your budget, the person who was supposed to get you a gift can be assigned to your person.", "That should be a sign to management that they need to get this under control. A good gift exchange gives you a range (say $20-30) so that everyone gets something decent, but it doesn\u2019t break the bank.", "Just drop out and do it as soon as possible. You can\u2019t afford the gift, that\u2019s a valid reason. She should have told you the cost upfront."]}
