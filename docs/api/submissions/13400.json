I also work 100% from home so I'm just here all the time.", "I\u2019m the meth raccoon in my household. My husband sighs when I say no more can fit but he finds a way. I believe that it\u2019s because he played Tetris and I didn\u2019t .. lol. I now call him over and ask him to Tetris the dishwasher!", ">Strangely he also thinks the dishes should be rinsed.\n\nProbably because they *do* need to be rinsed when you load it like a meth raccoon \ud83d\ude02 When they all get in the way of each other, they don't come clean. \n\nsource: I'm a meth raccoon when it comes to dishwashers, and I basically pre-wash them entirely before I put them in there and just consider the dishwasher to be a \"sanitizer.\" (I also think there's something wrong with my dishwasher because even when I load it nicely, they still don't come clean, so I've given up).", "My housecleaner used to ask for my assistance, I could get more dishes in and have them come out clean than anybody.", "Right?!", "I've always found that claims of not needing to be rinsed, at all, are hit or miss, especially if you don't create enough dirty dishes to need to run the washer every day.\n\nBut, yeah, my younger brother was non-plussed when he declared the dishwasher \"full\" at a family gathering, and I was able to re-arrange all the dishes in that he couldn't fit in there. Some people need to know their limitations.", "Weirdly, I was super good at Tetris, but I have like zero spatial awareness and can't deal with 3d stuff; I'm the meth raccoon when it comes to the dishwasher.  I've always been amazed by the people who can look at a space and tell you how big it is, whether a particular piece of furniture would fit in it, etc. because my brain just doesn't work that way.", "This is what we do. I swear my husband could make a third of a load of dishes take up all the space available, leaving the sink still full of dirty stuff. So I load, he unloads.", "I'm the Scandinavian in our relationship, and at least for us, it has to do with spatial awareness. I'm the daughter of an engineer and I have an acute sense of how to maximize space. He just throws stuff in there and says, \"there isn't any more room\" and then is amazed as I magically find a way to put every dish in the dishwasher with space between. \n\nI think you can tell who does the dishes. \n\nAlso, we have to rinse, because our dishwasher is from God knows when.", "For us, it's that I can get all our dirty dishes in the dishwasher properly and they'll come clean. If my husband loads it, they'll come clean, but it might take three loads to wash everything because \"there's no room for it all.\" He'd have no problem actually *doing* the three loads of dishes that he thinks it is, so it isn't like he's pretending to be dumb so that I'll do it. But I find it wasteful so it's better if he doesn't.", "I'm the Scandinavian in the relationship (thanks to my dad giving me such a complex about it I stopped even trying as a kid because I was going to have a panic attack). I don't care how my husband loads it as long as stuff gets CLEAN. There are really only two big things that need to be done to ensure that (tahini won't come off silverware and you can't stack the bowls together unless you want them all filthy). Beyond that I won't say anything to the raccoon. He's pretty cute.", "Honestly hoping I cam implement that logic here. I think he does bite his tongue most of the time but this time he let it rip for some reason. Still, not an excuse to be taking a bad day out on me! He's on dinner duty for the next week for this one.", "He has pretty high standards for a grown man who has to be told to do household chores. \n\nDemanding perfection from someone is insane. He can do it himself or chill the fuck out. OR he can do it himself AND chill the fuck out.", "All is lizard", "Tell him you\u2019re willing to discuss how you load the dishwasher if you can choose how he mows the lawn. Currently his use of a mower is ridiculous as it always turns out better if you hand cut the grass with scissors.", "LOL", "I always hum the Tetris theme while loading it lol", "Oh, no, they shouldn\u2019t. They should be loaded business side up.", "Upside down is how you get bent tines on the forks. Handle side down is better.", "I got a new washer and the utensils are up in the top rack. It has built in groove and you lay them in sideways. I had to look it up because I couldn't figure out why I didn't have a utensil basket. I even called the store to tell them someone stole my utensil basket!", "Have you tried different brands of detergent? I used store brand and nothing was clean. I thought it was the dishwasher and was pissed. That soap ran out and cascade platinum pods were on sale. Suddenly my dishes were spotless \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\uddd0", "Yeah this is pretty much how I am.  A sink full of dishes will take me 2 loads, but all come out clean; my spouse can somehow fit it all in a single load, also all comes out clean.", "It also depends on when you run your dishwasher and the cycle you use. So I only run mine every two days.  If I leave egg on a plate it will harden up and not properly come off.", "That\u2019s my feeling. I let my methed up trash panda load the dishwasher however he wants, since he is the one that has to rewash them anyway.", "Exactly! I've cut my hand with a knife twice while trying to put it handle-down. After the second time, I went back to handle-up. Drives my family crazy", "My Bosch dishwasher has a cutlery tray on top. I never knew how much I could love an appliance.", "yes!\n\ni'm only a Scandinavian architect about the bottom shelf. the top is total meth raccoon.", "Lol I'm the architect.  Sometimes I've seen my husband put the sharp knives in facing points up.  Omg I can't even cut ham off a bone without cutting myself, almost(probably did but I refused to go to the ER at 2am) needing stitches and you think putting knives points up is going to work out well for me? Lol I think not!", "This is the way. I am a Scandinavian architect Tetris champion. Always rinse - otherwise teeny bits of ick will be stuck on things. Especially utensils \ud83e\udd22", "I love my Bosch dishwasher. I tell it so every day.", "Only if no one else is around to see you.", "You must take your dishwasher and go somewhere else first", "Unless you are dish leader."]}
