It may have been worded that way but he was really asking you to make his life easier by doing something you don't want. He was trying to saddle you with responsibility for the situation instead of telling his step daughter to grow up and that not everything is about her.\n\n- Your grandmother is right about all this drama, but is wrong if she thinks that you're the one causing it.\n\n- This is your wedding, do it the way you want. Others are free to not attend if they don't like it.\n\n- And, in case it wasn't obvious by now, your step cousin seems to be a self centered asshole.\n\nMy suggestion would be to set a new wedding tradition for your family: People who don't treat others with respect don't get to be in the wedding party.", "NTA don't budge, they need to learn their lesson", "NTA, and please don\u2019t back down. At this point I would completely uninvite her because a scene WILL be made.", "NTA. This is you wedding and you are now a grownup. Make a stand and let the chips fall.", "I'll be honest, I didn't read your whole post.... but NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding & you can have whomever you want as your bridesmaids! don't let anyone tell you otherwise!", "NTA tell Tara and Jess if they continue to make a big fuss they will be banned entirely and if they show up will be removed by security.", "NTA don\u2019t give in", "If you back down now, she's going to pay you back by finding a way to ruin your day. Don't give in, and don't worry about the relatives bullying you to change your mind. They're only doing it to make THEIR lives easier.\n\nThis woman is damn near 30 years old. Now is as good a time as any to find out you don't always get your way.\n\nBest wishes, OP, and of course, NTA.", "NTA. I would tell her that since she's making such a big deal over it, she is no longer welcome at the wedding. It's nuts that you're all adults now and still letting her and her mother bully and try to control you.\n\nIf you give in now, do you think she'll be so glad about being included that she'll be on her best behavior? No. She's going to be a passive-aggressive nightmare up to the ceremony, and I don't doubt she would cause issues at the wedding and reception.", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to be at, or be in, your wedding if you don\u2019t want them to be.\n\nPs> make sure you have a bouncer at your reception \ud83e\udd23", "I can just imagine the size of most weddings if all cousins had to be bridesmaids. Many weddings would have more than 50!", "NTA. Tradition is just peer pressure from dead people.", "Nta tell her bluntly that its not that you dont consider her family, you just consider her annoying lmao", "NTA your wedding, your day. your call.  never mind all the back story , which would be enough to say 'no' just point out how she's ruined two earlier weddings and you have no intention of it being #3.", "NTA - I wouldn't even allow her to attend the wedding. You know she's going to cause drama.", "NTA but you need to uninvite her and her mother if you aren't giving in; she will try to ruin your wedding otherwise if she's as bad as she sounds in this post.", "NTA honestly she just learned her actions have consequences. And every time it gets brought up you could point out that her behavior is so over the top now this is why you didn't pick her.", "NTA but you did make a mistake. You shouldn\u2019t invite her (and apparently her mom) at all", "It seems like everyone in the family is willing to go to bat for Jess regardless of her actions. Time to cut the toxicity out of your life and just move on.", "Uninvite both Tara and Jess . NTA op don't set yourself on fire to please anyone else. FFS. Tell your fiance your history with Jess so he understands why you don't want her as bridesmaid.", "She is probably help other relatives with breaking precedent of excluding her.", "They learn that if they complain enough they can get what they want."]}
