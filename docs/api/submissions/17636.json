Rob married Jess\u2019s mother Tara when Jess was 9, and Rob already had my cousin Nate who was 8. \n\nI have 7 cousins total, and Jess tried to bully all of us. She didn\u2019t really succeed with my two older cousins, who were pre-teens and totally unbothered, but the rest of us were forced to play with her and she the absolute worst. She was bossy, and a nightmare if no one did what she told them, she\u2019d take things, break things, and tattle to her mother constantly. As we got older, it just got worse. She stole my cousin Beth\u2019s car because she was jealous she got one for her birthday. She stole our social media content and posted it publicly. She had a party at my aunt\u2019s empty apartment. It was bad. Nowadays she mostly nurses her intense victim complex and does her level best to be a soul sucking presence at christmases and summer holidays. \n\nIn our family, when one of us has got married the cousins are bridesmaids/groomsmen. Jess has been included in this twice and both times she was such a drag at all the events we literally had do-overs, and she got sent out of the bridal suite. I decided for mine that I wouldn\u2019t make her a bridesmaid. I am having a wedding of 300 people that has effectively been planned like a military operation and frankly is causing me more anxiety than I\u2019d like, I don\u2019t need Jess ruining the run up to the day. I asked all my female cousins and my father\u2019s girlfriend. I sent Jess a long message explaining that I wanted her to hear it from me, and that since we are not close I presumed she wouldn\u2019t be too put out but I hoped that she wasn\u2019t offended, understood my decision, and that she would still attend the wedding. All hell broke lose. My grandfather and father have been getting bombarded by Tara saying that they have to put their foot down and make me have Jess as a bridesmaid as is family tradition. Jess even went so far as to contact my fianc\u00e9 about how \u201churt\u201d she is (her creepy obsession with him is a whole other thing). Rob has contacted me to (to be fair to him, very kindly) ask me to reconsider. Jess is bemoaning the fact that by excluding her I\u2019ve basically said that she isn\u2019t family because she\u2019s not related, and she hasn\u2019t been shy about sharing this publicly.\n\nMy grandmother has said that it\u2019s unseemly to have this much drama surrounding the wedding and that I could have Jess up there on the day and just not invite her to anything beforehand, so that it at least looks cohesive. My grandmother is right about one thing, Tara and Jess are not letting it go and it\u2019s becoming a huge thing. So I\u2019m wondering if I made a mistake by taking this stand.\n\nEDIT - I\u2019m seeing a lot of people saying it\u2019s unfair that my family are siding with Jess; they aren\u2019t. My grandfather and father have both told Tara where to go. My grandmother doesn\u2019t like Jess any more than I do but she is sometimes more concerned with what her society circle thinks than the real situation, she\u2019s just trying to avoid gossip (not her finest moment but she isn\u2019t suggesting I give in for Jess\u2019s sake).", "created_utc": 1684493254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lrxac/aita_for_breaking_tradition_by_not_making_my/", "score": 1822, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe ask her point blank why she relentlessly bullied the lot of you when she considers you family? Maybe go scorched earth and point out why would you have your childhood bully as a bridesmaid??? Maybe ask her why she wants to be your bridesmaid when she obviously has a crush on your man? \n\nPersonally I dont think you should give in, whoever tries to tell you to stop rocking the boat remind them who Jess is and what has led to this. Ask them if they would have someone like that at their wedding as a bridesmaid. Or better yet ask them why it was ok to them that she make your life hell for years but now all of a sudden its bad that you dont want her in your life???? Anyone with a braincell can make the link between \"bully\" and \"exclusion,\" my guess is they dont want to look too hard at their previous indifference. \n\nIf you give in now then it will be a lifetime of this stuff; kids pull this all the time.
