Rob married Jess\u2019s mother Tara when Jess was 9, and Rob already had my cousin Nate who was 8. \n\nI have 7 cousins total, and Jess tried to bully all of us. She didn\u2019t really succeed with my two older cousins, who were pre-teens and totally unbothered, but the rest of us were forced to play with her and she the absolute worst. She was bossy, and a nightmare if no one did what she told them, she\u2019d take things, break things, and tattle to her mother constantly. As we got older, it just got worse. She stole my cousin Beth\u2019s car because she was jealous she got one for her birthday. She stole our social media content and posted it publicly. She had a party at my aunt\u2019s empty apartment. It was bad. Nowadays she mostly nurses her intense victim complex and does her level best to be a soul sucking presence at christmases and summer holidays. \n\nIn our family, when one of us has got married the cousins are bridesmaids/groomsmen. Jess has been included in this twice and both times she was such a drag at all the events we literally had do-overs, and she got sent out of the bridal suite. I decided for mine that I wouldn\u2019t make her a bridesmaid. I am having a wedding of 300 people that has effectively been planned like a military operation and frankly is causing me more anxiety than I\u2019d like, I don\u2019t need Jess ruining the run up to the day. I asked all my female cousins and my father\u2019s girlfriend. I sent Jess a long message explaining that I wanted her to hear it from me, and that since we are not close I presumed she wouldn\u2019t be too put out but I hoped that she wasn\u2019t offended, understood my decision, and that she would still attend the wedding. All hell broke lose. My grandfather and father have been getting bombarded by Tara saying that they have to put their foot down and make me have Jess as a bridesmaid as is family tradition. Jess even went so far as to contact my fianc\u00e9 about how \u201churt\u201d she is (her creepy obsession with him is a whole other thing). Rob has contacted me to (to be fair to him, very kindly) ask me to reconsider.

My grandmother is right about one thing, Tara and Jess are not letting it go and it\u2019s becoming a huge thing.

I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this drama but IMO you should stand your ground and do what you want! If family can\u2019t respect your decision for YOUR wedding then they don\u2019t have your best interest in mind unfortunately, tradition or not. Do you want to look back on your wedding pictures with someone you don\u2019t want in them just to appease people who are being incredibly selfish?

Jess has been causing trouble to family all this time, she stole a car and posted your private content publicly. If someone else had done these, they'd face jail time.

Please just uninvite her and block her and her mother. To anyone who continues to complain, call them out on how their enabling of her terrible behaviour makes them complicit in it. You will NOT be bullied by anyone about YOUR wedding. They can attend happily or stay away, but there is nothing to discuss.\n\nAnd to be honest, you should just block this awful woman. You can choose to protect yourself rather than expose yourself to a monster.

Sacrificing your day to appease their misplaced sense of what is right in a wedding is only going to hurt you. \n\nIt sounds like your step-cousin always gets her way because of how she acts and the rest of your family enables the behaviour. You could always let her know that if she can't respect your wishes on your own wedding day then maybe she doesn't love and support you that way someone should on that day and she doesn't need to come at all. Any family who continue to harass you should maybe be told the same thing.
