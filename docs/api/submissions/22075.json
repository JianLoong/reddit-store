I'm horrified by her saying that you and your husband secretly want to be women and should have stuff on hand, though; that is insane and homophobic. It would make me reevaluate that whole friendship.", "Tell her that men don't have periods, they have more like exclamation points.", "NTA It's not even that you REFUSED to give her one. You just didn't have one! Because only men that don't have periods live in your house! I'm a woman and would never expect someone to stock tampons for me, male/female gay or straight. That's ridiculous", "INFO\n\nWhat exactly do you understand the word \"refuse\" to mean?\n\nYou did not *refuse* to give her anything.\n\n> gay men want to be women\n\nSo you've now completely cut this bigot out of your life, correct?", "This doesn\u2019t really add up. This is your friend? Someone you know, and know to not be completely unhinged? And she just, in a period emergency, stood around and yelled at you both instead of taking you up on your offer to go get her some? \n\nAlso, why would you be TAH? Periods aren\u2019t less painful when you have a tampon. Why would you possibly think, in your 30s, that you could be an asshole for not owning period products that you don\u2019t need?\n\nLastly, why did you word your title like that? You didn\u2019t refuse to give her a tampon, why make it sound like you did?", "NTA. Some men do keep a small package of tampons/pads in their guest bathroom if they have a lot of female friends that come over a lot, but I understand why men won\u2019t waste money on something they are never going to personally need. Your friend is very entitled and would say homophobic/transphobia for the whole \u201cgay men want to be women\u201d comment. \n\n(And before anyone says \u201cit\u2019s just her period hormones/pain\u201d, being on your period doesn\u2019t mean you get to treat people like sh*t just for the hell of it, signed a woman who has had a period for over ten years).", "WTF. Obviously NTA.\n\nSure, it would be great if you proactively thought to have tampons on hand in case some visitor ever needed one. But you absolutely aren't obligated to do so. Additionally, you were kind enough to offer to go to the store despite her ridiculous attitude. Lastly, insinuating that gay men want to be women is just weird af. This woman should be cut out of your lives.", "NTA \n\nI actually laughed out loud at her demand and indignation for tampons in an all male household. \n\nShe definitely suffers from main character syndrome", "NTA it doesn't sound like you refused? You said you didn't have any, then you even offered to go get some. Her reaction was unnecessary.", "NTA but I\u2019m also having a hard time believing that this actually happened.", "NTA.  I'm a woman, way past the need for such. I have no supplies and would never think of keeping them on hand. There is no way I would expect men to have any!", "NTA - this woman sounds a bit deranged honestly.  I would never expect an all-male household to stock feminine hygiene supplies.  I mean, should you stock up on pampers in case someone with a baby comes by?  No.  Because responsible parents take diaper bags with them and are prepared.  Honestly, in my opinion, women should be prepared for their periods and have supplies with them if needed.  I ALWAYS carry tampons in my purse, whether I'm on my period or not.\n\nOn a different note, Mabel's views on gay men are pretty alarming.  I'd maybe reconsider her friendship status.", "NTA. I\u2019m a woman who didn\u2019t get a period for years due to my birth control and I didn\u2019t keep even tampons stocked at my house for most of that time\u2026 Also your \u201cfriend\u201d is toxic AF for dictating how a gay man is supposed to behave, wtf.", ">none of our friends have ever came to our house while on/starting their period. \n\nThis is unlikely.

She sounds unhinged.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I am a perimenopausal woman, and I don't keep tampons or pads in my house.\n\nEdit 2: Periods being potentially painful has nothing to do with the issue, and tampons do not make the pain better.", "NTA - I don't even know what to say her. This is very strange and her attitudes about gay men are strange too. \n\nYou offered to get some for her which is, imo, above and beyond.", "You are NTA in any way. I'm a woman past menopause and I don't keep period products in my house either. The women I know carry them in their purse or pockets (like I used to) and can take care of themselves. If they are caught unawares they ask and are OK if the answer is\"no\". Most women know how to improvise. I can't imagine how any woman could blame two men for not being able to supply period products. It really borders on being completely loony tunes, and so was her comment that gay men want to be women. Say what? It maybe time to rethink this particular \"friendship\".", "NTA. Your friend sounds completely unhinged.\n\nThat said, it's actually a good idea to have a pack of tampons at home. You never know when someone might need it, be it a visiting friend, relative or neighbor.", "NTA- I\u2019m telling you this as an adult woman. Your period is something you are responsible for. If this was a sudden period and she didn\u2019t have anything, then asking isn\u2019t really an issue. Getting angry because two men do not keep tampons in their home is inappropriate behavior. Continuing to be angry when you offered to get her supplies is ridiculous behavior.", "NTA. Gay man here too and what the fuck? I've never even seen a tampon except on TV commercials, which is also how I know that women menstruate blue water.", "She's homophobic, and sexist as shit.\n\nWhy are you even questioning if you're an ah? She's a raging bigot. Ofc You're NTA. Why isn't that obvious?", "Yeesh. So much toxic behavior and bigotry to unpack from one post, and it's all from her. Who is she to dictate what a \"real\" gay man is?! Why is her idea of gayness that it must be catering to women/people with periods?! Sounds like she uses you two as a prop, strongly suggest distancing yourself. Also you didn't refuse! You graciously offered to get her some! Very much NTA.", "NTA. She sounds crazy and manipulative. Stay away.", "NTA \n\nYou said women don't come to your house when they are having their periods... I had to laugh because if you have women friends then of course at some point, likely on a semi regular basis, you have hosted someone on their cycle. \n\nYou were unaware because ITS PRIVATE AND THERE IS NO REASON FOR SOMEONE TO INVOLVE YOU! LOL \n\nClearly the fact that every other woman you know has never made this request tells you that it's not because they have never been on their period while visiting but rather because that ONE woman made an ass of herself and behaved in a way that all those other women would never dream of behaving like. \n\nAnd to say you want to b a woman is insulting. She needs a lesson on the difference on sexuality and gender identity.  After she fishishes kindergarten again because she needs to go back and brush up on that particular curriculum.", "NTA", "Wtf did I just read?? NTA. That person is 100% bananas! Do you have to keep them as a friend? Because this is just absolutely unhinged\u2026yikes!", "NTA but your \"friend\" is a huge one. I'd cut ties with her. She sounds like an absolute maniac. Sorry you had to go through that :(", "NTA. Is she usually this unhinged?", "NTA.  It should have gone like this.  Mabel:  I demand a tampon.  OP:  I demand you leave and seek psychiatric help.", "No tampons in the house?  What if someone gets a nose bleed, your not prepared.", "NTA - though a lot of people do have a small emergency kit for friends who have their period while over for a visit. I would be eternally thankful if my gay friends have this but I can\u2019t imagine gerring mad at them if they don\u2019t.

Ever noticed a woman taking her purse to the bathroom with her before? Or go rummage in her purse before using the bathroom? That's normally what women visiting other people's houses quietly do when on their period.", "NTA .\nShe sounds insufferable . \nHowever I do think your point of \u201cnone of our friends have ever came to our house while on their period\u201d is not really justifiable , as you wouldn\u2019t have any way to know if that is 100% true , and periods can be unexpected or worse than usual for someone who might not be as prepared .
