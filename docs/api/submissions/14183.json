About a year and a half ago, one of his older sisters passed away. It was very sudden and shocking and the family is still in mourning. \n\nRecently, my boyfriend and I have started discussing baby names (even though we are keeping the gender a surprise until the baby is born.) Agreeing on a boy name was easy enough, but he is dead-set on wanting the baby named after his late sister if it\u2019s a girl. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be insensitive so I told him that I would think about it, but I already knew what my answer was. No. \n\nHis sister and I never really got along. She acted cold and was distant towards me (the rest of his family and I get along fine so I\u2019m not sure why) from the beginning. Maybe if we had been closer I would be more open to the idea of naming the baby after her but I\u2019m not sure. Also, this is probably selfish but I just don\u2019t want the baby named after a family member that has recently died. I don\u2019t want them to grow up feeling like they\u2019re just a memory of their aunt. \n\nAfter a few days of thinking about it, I let my boyfriend know how I feel. He was shocked that I said no and became incredibly upset, calling me selfish and immature and other things like that. I offered to compromise and use his sister\u2019s name as the baby\u2019s middle name but he didn\u2019t like that idea. He said he wants the baby\u2019s first name to be used after her and he won\u2019t budge on that. He won\u2019t listen to any other names that I like for the baby, and now he\u2019s barely speaking to me at all. So, I don\u2019t know what to do. My family doesn\u2019t really care about the baby\u2019s name but his family is also really upset that I said no (especially his mother, which I understand but I think she\u2019s the one who is really pressuring my boyfriend to get me to agree to this.)\n\nanyway\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1680825009, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12e2i42/aita_for_not_wanting_to_name_my_baby_after_my/", "score": 267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His family are in mourning. I was going to suggest not stating exactly why, but maybe finding some info regarding kids named after other people and the impact it has on them, then gently raise it with your bf.

My little brother is named after my dad\u2019s uncle Johnny who died right before my brother was born. My parents wanted to name my brother after him but didn\u2019t want to name him John. So what they did instead was looked at the John equivalents in other countries and languages, like Juan, Hans, Johann, Gianni, and so on and so forth.

What happens if two parents won't agree on a baby's name? Do hospitals have some sort of procedure to follow in events like that? \n\nEither way, your husband is going to have to compromise. This baby only half belongs to him, so he only gets half a say. If he won't go for the middle name idea, maybe try and pitch names that are similar to his sisters name.

Beyond feeling like a replacement, they tended to be very afraid that they would die in the same way, or have the same issues, as their namesake. No kid should have to go through that. \n\nWhile I hope your bf turns it around, if he doesn't, it's important that you do what's best for the baby and not what he wants, because he isn't considering the baby's or your feelings right now.

So while hopefully he can change his stance and work this out to find a name they can agree on, if he won't, then she needs to choose the name. Otherwise the baby is going to be named after not only someone who died prematurely (which can be especially bad depending on the cause of death, such as if it was suicide, an overdose, cancer, etc. because the child can get hung up on the idea that they are doomed to die that way too, as I've seen with kids named that way in my extended family), which is a horrible thing to do to any kid, but also OP will have a child named after the sister of her ex-boyfriend who disliked her. The middle name of my first kid was chosen against my wishes, and it bothers me every time I have to write it down. I can only imagine how much worse it would be for the first name for OP. \n\nThe boyfriend's inflexible stance shows he's not really thinking about the baby as an individual yet, nor valuing their or their mother's feelings, he's still just processing his grief.
