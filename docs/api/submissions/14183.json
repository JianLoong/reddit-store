About a year and a half ago, one of his older sisters passed away. It was very sudden and shocking and the family is still in mourning. \n\nRecently, my boyfriend and I have started discussing baby names (even though we are keeping the gender a surprise until the baby is born.) Agreeing on a boy name was easy enough, but he is dead-set on wanting the baby named after his late sister if it\u2019s a girl. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be insensitive so I told him that I would think about it, but I already knew what my answer was. No. \n\nHis sister and I never really got along. She acted cold and was distant towards me (the rest of his family and I get along fine so I\u2019m not sure why) from the beginning. Maybe if we had been closer I would be more open to the idea of naming the baby after her but I\u2019m not sure. Also, this is probably selfish but I just don\u2019t want the baby named after a family member that has recently died. I don\u2019t want them to grow up feeling like they\u2019re just a memory of their aunt. \n\nAfter a few days of thinking about it, I let my boyfriend know how I feel. He was shocked that I said no and became incredibly upset, calling me selfish and immature and other things like that. I offered to compromise and use his sister\u2019s name as the baby\u2019s middle name but he didn\u2019t like that idea. He said he wants the baby\u2019s first name to be used after her and he won\u2019t budge on that. He won\u2019t listen to any other names that I like for the baby, and now he\u2019s barely speaking to me at all. So, I don\u2019t know what to do. My family doesn\u2019t really care about the baby\u2019s name but his family is also really upset that I said no (especially his mother, which I understand but I think she\u2019s the one who is really pressuring my boyfriend to get me to agree to this.)\n\nanyway\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1680825009, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12e2i42/aita_for_not_wanting_to_name_my_baby_after_my/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd think hard about that. he has no respect for your feelings and reasonings, which frankly are all valid. your not having this child as a tribute to his lost sister. women too often allow themselves to be treated in ways that aren't healthy to keep the peace. you say you don't know what to do.

He doesn't get to \"not budge;\" you're the one carrying the baby and you'll be the one giving birth to the baby, so you have the final say on the baby's name.

In a few years you may not even still be together (especially if that's how he acts), but your daughter would be stuck with that name. \n\nYou were willing to compromise and he just blew up on you and is giving you the cold shoulder.

They made the baby's middle name the deceased brother's name and that side of the family only called the baby by the middle name instead of the first name and it was super unhealthy.

I hope everything works out for you though, just make sure the father isn't in charge of filling out the birth certificate even if you decide on a different name, you never know what could happen.", "NTA. You need 2 enthusiastic yeses for a baby name. \n\nMaybe offer some other ways to honor his sister? Plant a tree on the property in her honor or commission a children\u2019s book about her for the kids to read. It sounds like your husband is worried about forgetting her which isn\u2019t an unreasonable fear, especially if you were on bad terms with her. Make an effort to show him that his sister will be remembered and that your kids will know who she was.", "NTA, I was named after an aunt that passed when she was a child.

I wanted my own identity.\n\nMy name was chosen by my father (it was his sister) and I hate it. I instead used my nickname as it felt better and family said I was \"erasing\" my aunts identity and should be more proud. I think suggesting the middle name was an incredibly fair option.", "NTA- sometimes it's nice to have a boyfriend instead of a husband. As you learn facts that make you go hmmmm", "NTA, Believe it or not, naming a child is a 50/50 decision.

Disagreeing solely because you didn\u2019t really get along and she was cold (you sure you weren\u2019t the cold one?) is an unfortunate reason to go against something that might mean everything to him. \n\nThe excuse \u201cI don\u2019t want a dead person\u2019s name/ my kid will feel less special (eh, no she won\u2019t) is just a dumb excuse you\u2019re making to try and validate yourself. \n\nIf you had a real reason (the name just isn\u2019t a good one, doesn\u2019t suit my taste) then yes, but \u201cI just didn\u2019t like the girl\u201d sucks to use as the sole reason to deprive him of this honor.

It would only reinforce a negative feeling if she has the same name as his sister who treated you the same way.", "NTA, you offered the middle name which was generous considering the circumstances. His family are in mourning. I was going to suggest not stating exactly why, but maybe finding some info regarding kids named after other people and the impact it has on them, then gently raise it with your bf. Coming from that angle might alleviate some of the resentment.

You were willing to compromise and use the middle name; he wasn't. I'm sure his grief is clouding his judgment. Perhaps therapy could help.", "NTA, of course. But if I can make a suggestion? My little brother is named after my dad\u2019s uncle Johnny who died right before my brother was born. My parents wanted to name my brother after him but didn\u2019t want to name him John. So what they did instead was looked at the John equivalents in other countries and languages, like Juan, Hans, Johann, Gianni, and so on and so forth.

If the homage to his sister is important to your bf but you would prefer a name that wasn\u2019t hers, you can always look for a different version of the sister\u2019s name or something in a different culture with the same meaning.", "NTA. A name shouldn\u2019t have negative feelings attached.", "NTA. Baby names need to be agreed upon by both parents. To initially get upset because you do not agree with the name he wants is understandable but to continue to hold onto that anger is not. Does your boyfriend understand that you were not close to his sister because of her demeanor or are you just supposed to forget that when naming your child? Or because she died, does he think that no longer matters? Not sure what the answer for this is, other than to hope you have a boy so the problem is bypassed for this baby.", "NTA\n\nIn this day and age it is a bit creepy to name a baby after someone who's recently deceased. I get that your partner is still full of grief but he doesn't get the final say here. Baby names are two yes's with full veto from either partner. \n\nYour compromise of using her name as the baby's middle name is a perfect way to respectfully honor his sister.", "NTA. He's setting up your daughter to be sister 2.0 and it's right not to give her that baggage.\n\nI hope you have a boy.", "NTA, but I'm curious as to how that works on paper. What happens if two parents won't agree on a baby's name? Do hospitals have some sort of procedure to follow in events like that? \n\nEither way, your husband is going to have to compromise. This baby only half belongs to him, so he only gets half a say. If he won't go for the middle name idea, maybe try and pitch names that are similar to his sisters name. For example if his sisters name was Lauren you could suggest naming the baby Laura.

That's not agreement, that's acquiescence.

Your boyfriend's lack of willingness to compromise or even discuss things rationally, doesn't bode well for how he will be able to work out future issues down the line. My brother died suddenly in his 20s (suicide) and the grief was intense and blindsiding, so I have empathy for your boyfriend, but when I named my own kids I chose not to use his name because I have seen how badly it impacted other kids who were named that way in my extended family. Beyond feeling like a replacement, they tended to be very afraid that they would die in the same way, or have the same issues, as their namesake. No kid should have to go through that. \n\nWhile I hope your bf turns it around, if he doesn't, it's important that you do what's best for the baby and not what he wants, because he isn't considering the baby's or your feelings right now.

So while hopefully he can change his stance and work this out to find a name they can agree on, if he won't, then she needs to choose the name. Otherwise the baby is going to be named after not only someone who died prematurely (which can be especially bad depending on the cause of death, such as if it was suicide, an overdose, cancer, etc. because the child can get hung up on the idea that they are doomed to die that way too, as I've seen with kids named that way in my extended family), which is a horrible thing to do to any kid, but also OP will have a child named after the sister of her ex-boyfriend who disliked her. The middle name of my first kid was chosen against my wishes, and it bothers me every time I have to write it down. I can only imagine how much worse it would be for the first name for OP. \n\nThe boyfriend's inflexible stance shows he's not really thinking about the baby as an individual yet, nor valuing their or their mother's feelings, he's still just processing his grief.
