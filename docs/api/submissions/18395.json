{"id": 18395, "submission_id": "13tzuox", "title": "AITA for arguing with a collegue about my outfit?", "selftext": "Alright so I(F21) am I first year teacher and have had a wonderful school year where I get along with most of my collegues just fine and have no issues with. Now with it being so close to the end of the year our admin has allowed teachers a more relaxed dress code for more days during the week than usual though it still has to be fairly professional and not being something outrageous. I didn't have a problem with this until Thursday.\n\nIt started off as normal and my classes went by without a hitch besides a few behavioral issues that I had to deal with from some students. It wasn't until around 11:00 during my planning period that a colleague(M30) of mine showed up and was asking for something. When he entered he initially gave a confused look but didn't mention anything so I didn't think much of it and just gave him what he had asked for and went on with the rest of my period and day not really paying much attention to the encounter. Now I do have to say this collegues of mine I didn't really know so I didn't have a positive or negative opinion on him at the time and he isn't my superior or anything, he's not even in the same department as me.\n\nFast forward to the end of the day I'm doing my bus duty when he approached me again and asked if I can chat with him. I agreed and finished when all the buses left and went to go talk with him. Wehn I asked what was up he told me that he was ashamed at me for going the entire day in unprofessional attire for teaching l. I was taken aback by it as I viewed my outfit as fairly professional for the setting. I asked him what was wrong with the outfit and he said that my blouse was sleeveless and that it was too form fitting along with my pants. This led to us getting into an argument with each other, although there was no yelling between us. I said that my outfit was just as form fitting as some of the male teachers and that it was always a double standard with women. He countered that it was an asshole move to bring feminism and double standards into it when my outfit was unprofessional. This argument went on for a little bit with neither of us relenting until he said that he would just report it to admin and let them deal with it. So I'm wondering am I the asshole for arguing about the dress code with my collegue?

Would not be out of place at my school or any other.\n\nOP, I would recommend going to HR and talking about this with them. He argued with you over a non-issue, in a very misogynistic and antagonistic way, and is threatening to go to admin himself; I think it\u2019d be wise to talk to them as soon as you can so you can set the record straight before he smears you. Do so wearing the outfit so they can see exactly what he\u2019s taking issue with. I can\u2019t imagine anyone who actually has a good grasp of the dress code would find anything wrong with your outfit.\n\nEDIT: Just did a double-take, kudos to you for being able to teach a whole day in those heels!

Your outfit is very professional and I see nothing wrong with it.

Lmao, it reminds me of the good ole dress code crap forced on girls but not boys. You didn\u2019t deserve that, hell with that guy.", "NTA.\n\nYou made him uncomfortably horny or something.

Michelle Obama used to wear a lot of sleeveless shirts. Is he attracted to you by any chance? This is weird.", "NTA. I would make a complaint about him harassing you. His behavior is highly inappropriate. He\u2019s sexist. You didn\u2019t bring in feminism, you made an argument. He made it about feminism. Also it\u2019s likely because you are quite young and he feels like he can boss you around. Make a complaint and demand him behaving professionally. \nAbout your outfit: it\u2019s absolutely appropriate. I teach too and that\u2019s similar to what I and my colleagues were everyday.

Your co-worker is harassing you and I would report it.\n\nEdit: If you\u2019re in the US, what state are you teaching in?\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m literally in shock. I have colleagues who wear corduroy jeans and crew neck sweatshirts with sneakers on a regular basis. You\u2019re following a professional dress code much better than those people and I doubt this man would ever say anything to them about it. Your co-worker is absolutely sexualizing you and I\u2019m disgusted. Especially if you\u2019re saying that others dress similarly.

Your coworker can go pound sand.", "NTA. It's the end of the school year and summer heat. What does he expect? A burka?", "NTA.  Your outfit looks nice.  I work in a field where professional means no sleeveless tops so I keep a lightweight cardigan to wear over such tops in the summer.", "NTA\nThere is nothing unprofessional about your outfit.", "NTA. That outfit would be considered perfectly appropriate at the schools in our area.

When he objected to your clothing you got defensive but he\u2019s the one out of line here. Report him to hr", "Nta.  He is.  What a controlling jerk. Typical of some men to feel they have a right to school women. What is wrong with a sleeveless shirt. OMG your arms are showing???

Someone had an issue with that outfit? You have got to be kidding me. Some people are just obnoxious assholes.", "You look amazing and totally appropriate and professional. I suspect he thought you looked good as well and had inappropriate thoughts and projected onto you. That is akin to sexual harassment and he has no right or authority to speak to you about what you wear. And to say that he is ashamed of you is just completely inappropriate. Who is he to be ashamed. He should be ashamed that it affected him so much. He is sexist and a creep and I suggest you file a complaint immediately and make this your hill to die in. Make them explain what is wrong with your outfit and how any sane rational human being would be affected and how their inappropriate thoughts are your responsibility and not theirs. Double down on male teacher wearing tight pants and explain that it could be inappropriate to bring attention to their physique and make them explain how your shoulder are less appropriate than that.\nYou don\u2019t deserve this but you cannot let yourself be bullied and objectified by that man and you need to make sure your bosses know what actually occurred.\nNta", "I think he has feelings he doesn't know what to do with and that's a him problem.
