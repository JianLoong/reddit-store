You knew what it was, 2. You knew you wanted, and 3. Was available for you to book, you instead booked something else? And now you want to know if that makes *someone else* an AH?\n\nIt\u2019s you. You\u2019re the problem.", "YTA. You sneakily tried to get a bridal trial for free and then expected her to be thrilled to do work for you? Nah.

You *did* waste her time.\n\nESH\u2014but mostly you.\n\nYou might not have known what \"Passio\" meant, but you knew your wanted a bridal trial and it was available on her booking tab; you should have chosen that. If you were curious about the free \"Passio\" booking, your option was to not book anything at all, and submit an inquiry.\n\nI agree that she was an asshole for not communicating better\u2014andshe really should have checked with the photographer as soon as you tried to book the appointment, not just the night before\u2014but the root cause of the cancellation was *you* trying to get something for nothing and booking the wrong appointment.", "YTA. why couldn\u2019t you just inquire about what \u201cpassio\u201d was WITHOUT booking it??", "YTA you didn't even know what you were booking", "YTA. If you\u2019re curious about what a service is, you call or email to inquire, you don\u2019t just randomly book it.

Passio could have been a service to shave your head or a chemical peel or costume makeup. It could have been completely unrelated to makeup! And then there would be no free feel for her work. She probably doesn't check the booking comments because Passio probably instructs his clients to book it, and she figures he's already fully informed his clients on procedures.  When she called Passio and he had no appointment she probably figured it was a mistake. If you had questions you should have DMed her. You just thought you'd try and get the free thing. And then when you told her that she should have better explained what Passio was, she took the advice and gave an informative video of why brides should book bridal trials. Not that it requires explanation.", "ESH- It sounds like she has a deal with that photographer where she gets paid a cut of the package with him at no extra charge to do makeup for the shoot. So when you didn't have an appointment with Passio she booked off 2 hours for nothing. You should have booked the bridal trial and asked then if you didn't know or sent a direct message/phone call asking before you booked. She should have communicated with you directly about the appointment being cancelled before you showed up.", "You should have booked the bridal trial (what you actually wanted), then asked about the other service.\n\nESH\n\nThe MUA should have read the comments and made a phone call since there was a question asked.", "YTA.

You dodged a bullet imo, you don\u2019t want your MUA for the big day to only have a handle on things the night before.", "NTA - What kind of business is this that doesn\u2019t even answer basic questions about bookings? Your just supposed to randomly know what passio means when going through booking? She should have something on her site or insta explaining what the service is. I will say you probably should have called for more information. However, she basically lost a potential client for not having something as simple as a description or requirements of the service on her site or confirmation email. At the very least she should have called you that morning to let you know the appointment was canceled and see if you want to rebook.", "NTA - Her errors led to blaming the customer by not answering the question you posted below.

One of the vendors I am currently looking for is a MUA. I found someone on Instagram and I really liked her work. I went to her booking tab to book a bridal trial, but then saw an option called \u2018passio\u2019 which is a 2hr session for free. I tried to Google what that was, but did not find anything. Well\u2026 I went ahead and booked it. In the comment section I wrote that I did not know what the service was and would like to inquire about it. I figured they would get back to me and give me more info. I did not- Just an email a few days later saying my appt was approved. I was surprised, but super excited.  I thought , maybe this is for the artist\u2019s portfolio, I assumed I would not get to ask for what I want, but that was fine. This would give me an insight into what it\u2019s like to work with them and if I like their style. \n\nAnyways\u2026 a few days before the appt I received a text to confirm - which I did. Then I received a text daily to remind me of the appt. I took time off work and showed up early. I waited and called her when our appt time rolled around- No answer, so I left a voicemail. She called back 10 mins later and told me she canceled the appt last night. \n\nApparently Passio is a photographer. And she called him last night to confirm they had an appt and he said no, so it was canceled. I told her, no one told me and I even got a reminder text an hour ago about our appt. I told her I was really just curious about what the service was. I was surprised that I got booked and thought it was a good opportunity to see her work, I did not feel entitled to a free service. What I did have a problem with was the lack of communication to me that our appt was canceled. She apologized but did reinforce her point that if I wanted a bridal trial, that\u2019s what I should have booked. She then asked me when my wedding was and if I still wanted to book a trial. I told her no, I wanted to work with someone a bit better with communication. I thought that was the end of it. I thought we had a very respectful, honest conversation. I was bummed my time was wasted, but again\u2014 I do not feel entitled to her time for free. \n\nWhen I got home, I went on Instagram to unfollow her, only to see she had written a post. It went something along the lines of \u2018if you are looking for a bridal trial, you should book that. Don\u2019t book something you don\u2019t know what it is. My booking service is very straight forward. I don\u2019t want to waste your time nor do I want my time wasted\u2019. She then had a second slide asking if her followers wanted a livestream to talk about what are expectations of the clients. \n\nI was shocked. Based on my interpretation of what happened, only my time was wasted. She was not even at her studio. I was not trying to waste her time, I was just curious and she could have not booked me. She did not do her due diligence and is now blaming me for wasting her time. I blocked her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
