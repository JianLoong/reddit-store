{"id": 16952, "submission_id": "13efdlk", "title": "AITA for telling him that he\u2019s not going to take up my entire birthday weekend?", "selftext": "So this is about my family, boyfriend, and my birthday that\u2019s coming up. \n\nMy birthday falls on a Saturday, and it also happens to be my 21st. My boyfriend calls me up on the phone today wanting me to take Friday off (the day before my birthday) because he\u2019s made plans with me. Then, he says that he has also made plans for Saturday, my actual birthday. I was hoping to be able to spend some time with my family on my birthday. Especially since it\u2019s my 21st. I don\u2019t usually care about celebrating on the day all the time, but when it comes to these sorts of birthdays, I like to do it on the day because it feels more exciting. \n\nI said that instead of Friday, why don\u2019t we do something on Sunday? So then he says \u201cWell why don\u2019t we do all 3? Friday, Saturday and then we can do something on Sunday, too?\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s also into motorcycles. So he asked me \u201cI was wondering, and I wanted to ask you first instead of surprising you with it so that you don\u2019t think I did it for me.\u201d And then he tells me about doing some sort of motorcycle club thing where you ride around and collect things. Now I don\u2019t really mind, but I can tell that it\u2019s obviously something he doesn\u2019t want to miss, but the event unfortunately falls on my birthday. So he wants me to do it with him & make it a \u201cbirthday activity\u201d for me. \n\nAnyways, I told him that I wanted to spend my birthday at my house so that my family could spend it with me, and I invited him to come along, too. He said that they can do something with me on Sunday instead. I was kind of offended when he said this.\n\nThe thing is, if I stole him for his entire birthday weekend, he would want to include his family somewhere in there. His parents would probably be upset with me for wanting him to myself the whole time. I wouldn\u2019t even think to take up his entire birthday weekend in the first place. For his birthday, I went out to eat with his whole family. As he wanted it. But for my birthday weekend, he wanted it all to himself, and was unenthused when I wanted to include my family. \n\nHe also wants me to drink/get wasted on my 21st. I know that it\u2019s a tradition, but he knows that I HATE the taste of alcohol. It also affects my kidneys. I had 4 shots once, and I couldn\u2019t sleep for 2 days because I had such bad pain radiating from my mid-back down the back of my legs. Even the taste of alcohol makes me want to throw up. He keeps convincing me that I\u2019ll like all these new types of alcohols, but I just know I won\u2019t. Although he\u2019s desperate that I find one that I like. He has this constant goal in his mind that he will find me alcohol that I\u2019ll like and enjoy. My Dad died of alcohol poisoning a couple years ago, so I\u2019ve never exactly been a fan. Regardless, he\u2019s big into it and wants me to find drinks that I like, too. I just don\u2019t really want to. I just want to dress up girly and go for a picnic on the beach and drink some sparkling juice and eat some cheesecake and watch the sunset. Not go to the bar and get wasted. \n\nAITA for bursting his bubble for wanting to include my family on my birthday instead of going along with everything that he planned/suggested?", "created_utc": 1683787698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13efdlk/aita_for_telling_him_that_hes_not_going_to_take/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They play on your insecurities and make you feel unlovable so you don't realize you deserve better and then try to change/work harder to please the AH (and thus putting your needs aside and making your self esteem and mental health even worse. then the jerk complains because your mental illness is flared up... because of them being shitty. It's a bad cycle. You often end up blaming yourself because their actions make no sense in the context of a decent, empathetic, and reasonable person... but they arent kind or logical. Their actions are entirety self serving).\n\nPlease discuss your relationship and self esteem in therapy if you aren't already. If a relationship is making your mental health worse, it's not the one for you. There will be challenges in any relationship, and having mental illness means you might hit barriers you need to overcome, but if you're overall getting worse or feel bad after hanging out with or speaking with the person your dating... it's not a good sign. \n\nYou might want to lose the man as a birthday gift to yourself and go have fun with your family and friends.

And don't mesure my value with my abilities to be drunk. \n\nSo do what make you happy for YOUR birthday and your bf can go drink itself in a coma stupor.", "NTA it is your birthday.", "Give yourself the birthday present of being single, this guy sounds selfish as hell. He wants to spend *your* birthday doing something *he* wants to do, and then wants to get you drunk, which will cause you **physical pain**.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nHe is selfish and entitled. \n\nThink long and hard about this relationship- that\u2019s what dating is for- figuring out who you want to date and how they will be as a partner. \n\nThis partner has shown how he will be on your special days \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNot to mention the alcohol thing is completely out of line. He doesn\u2019t share your concerns, and completely dismisses your health issues.", "\"dress up girly and go for a picnic on the beach and drink some sparkling juice and eat some cheesecake and watch the sunset.\"\n\nSounds like a perfect birthday. I don't actually mean to crticise your boyfriend here, but it does not sound like you are long term compatible.\n\nNTA", "NTA but if he's willing to be this inconsiderate around your birthday I don't even want to know how awful a boyfriend he normally is. Question: how often does he compromise things he wants for your interests and comfort?", "NTA. He wants you to accompany him to his hobbies. Nothing to do with you or your birthday. Also he keeps pushing your boundaries when it comes to alcohol so you should rethink the relationship.", "So he wants to give himself a birthday present for your birthday, pressures you to drink when you have medical issues and plain m dont want to \n\nYou know it is okay to be single.\n\nNTA, but remember he cares about himself, not you.  Recognize the sign", "NTA and I must say, your idea of how you want to spend your birthday sounds fantastic! Happy Birthday!", "OMG he is so selfish. your birthday but will go something that he loves to do... really?\n\nso he wanted you to skip family on your birthday and be with him doing something for him.... can you ear \"me, me, me, me\" when he talks?\n\nNTA he never considers what you want or like by the things you wrote", "have your all seen her previous posts?\n\nthis is not a relationship, it's a punishment!", "NTA. Why are you with someone who tries to force alcohol on you, and disregards your dislike for it, and who wants to prioritize himself and *literally* everyone else other than you for even one day when it's your birthday? \n\nIs any part of this relationship about you, because it doesn't sound like it.", "Ahh another, \"there were no signs\" poster", "She doesn't like drink.  Why are people pressuring her to?", "I think the bigger deal here is trying to force alcohol on her when she has kidney issues, that is terrible!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He's either incredibly cruel or so profoundly selfish it's embarrassing.   \nYou're 21. Maybe start the year off on fresh footing, single, and ready to find someone who respects you?", "have fun with your family and send him a breakup text", "I don't think he is a good boyfriend. I think you should reconsider this relationship. He does not care for you or for your wishes.", "after skimming OP's post history, add these to the list:\n\n8. refuses to do equal share of chores around the house without being nagged\n\n9. drags you to a situation (public/crowded) where he knows you'll be uncomfortable and then does not talk to you/include you the entire night\n\n10. refuses to communicate with you when you bring up your concerns in an attempt to find solutions\n\n11. gets upset when you bring up your relationship to your therapist\n\njust... woof, girl.", "That post history has me convinced this is now either somebody trying to get karma.
