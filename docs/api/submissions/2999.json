{"id": 2999, "submission_id": "z2650x", "title": "AITA for cancelling my (ex) boyfriend's plane ticket, leaving him homeless and unable to get to his family?", "selftext": "A brief history: I met my now-ex-boyfriend while doing volunteer work. Frankly... he's not been the nicest to me. He is just nice enough, just often enough to have had me convinced that he loved me. It's easier to see in retrospect.\n\nA few weeks before this incident, I booked both of us plane tickets to Germany. He needs to go there to stay with family as he doesn't have anywhere to live here now his current lease is up. The plan was for him to fly one-way and for me to go with him for a short stay, then return home by myself. We were supposed to leave today.\n\nNow onto what happened: in between his lease ending and flying abroad, ex has been staying at a friend's house in a more rural town - and I was invited to visit while his friend was away. We got to the house and my ex started to make dinner for us. We were joking back and forth, being affectionate... and then, in one moment, he FLIPPED. I had gone to hug him when he wanted to peel potatoes, and he just started yelling. I honestly cannot come up with a bigger reason for him losing his temper aside from that hug - it was so out of the blue. And I'll admit... in that moment I had a panic attack. My distress only served to escalate his anger. He told me to get out, that there was a bus stop down the street, that I'd better hope to get there in time. I gathered my things and left, and thankfully did manage to catch a bus.\n\nAfter that initial period of shock, I realised I could never go back to him. I definitely couldn't go to a foreign country with him. I went to the airline's website to cancel my flights... and there was his booking too. I cancelled it in an impulsive, numb moment. I didn't even get a refund because it's an economy airline.\n\nA few days ago, he texted me as though nothing had happened asking for his flight details. I replied that there was no flight - that of course I wasn't going to pay to go to Germany with him after what happened. He sent a long reply saying that I knew he had nowhere else to go, that I knew he was struggling with money, and that I had effectively made him homeless and he hopes I'm pleased with myself. I honestly didn't know what to say in return, but luckily I haven't heard from him since. I don't know if he's been able to get a flight himself and a tiny part of me does worry for him. AITA?\n\nP.S. I paid for both our tickets with my own money - we never discussed this explicitly but I just assumed he would pay me back at some point. Since that it has become quite clear that that was never going to happen.

There is no money back, right? If the sole outcome is harming someone else, how can this be okay?\n\nIf OP gets money back, sure, all good, but otherwise it is a petty move.", "NTA. Also, if he is German, as your post seems to imply, you did not leave him stranded. He can go to any german embassy, request a ticket home and get it. In germany there is social security and unemployment benefits, so he won't starve and will get an apartment. All he needs is a passport or federal id. Fuck him, bullet dodged, rest your guilty conscience.", "NTA Don\u2019t worry - he definitely convinced someone else to pay for the flight. He is in Germany right now.", "NTA\n\nA basic lesson in life is that you don't lash out at those who are giving you money in any shape or form, be it food, shelter or plane tickets. You're patient, you suck it up and let go of things. He hadn't learned the lesson. I hope he has now.\n\nAnd regarding you, you have learned not to be so generous with people who don't deserve it. Moreso when they make you literally fear for your safety. \n\nI wish you a healthy recovery from that \"relationship\". And please, install cameras in your place and change the locks. And always carry mace with you.", "NTA. \"I hope you're pleased with yourself\" \"Yea, i am\"", "Nta, but I personally would feel safer if he had left.", "Did he make sure you got home safely? No. He just pointed you  at the bus-stop and told you to hope. So why does he think it\u2019s *your*  responsibility to get *him* home safely? NTA.", "At least Eurowings has flights from Germany to the US and is a discount airline.", "Yeah! She should have said to him, \"Well, you better hope you catch that bus to Germany.\"", "Same. OP is not an asshole for what she did, she did not owe her abusive asshole ex anything, but if I were her I would have let the ex fly away to Germany.", "Agreed. Letting him keep the ticket would have been the smart thing to do but OP is not an asshole for what she did.", "Enter the surprised Pikachu face.... NTA", "my father used to do shit like this (and probably still does) and he's just a regular abusive prick. probably has a cluster B personality disorder, but no PTSD or schizophrenia. \n\nonce when I was about 13 he was in the kitchen and I needed a spoon so I tried to just quickly slip one out of the draw. BIIIG mistake. He started **screaming** at me for not saying \"excuse me\". My friend from school was over and father was screaming *so* much (followed me back into the bedroom) that my friend panicked and called her mum to pick her up.", "So you lost out on all that money for cancelling when what you should have done was gone on vacation yourself to de stress from dating that asshole.", "NTA his family can pay for a ticket to go home.\n\nBlock his number and if he comes near you file a restraining order.", "NTA. He can get his family to book him a ticket. Block his number.", "NTA.", "NTA but it might have been better not to have cancelled his ticket so that he'll be far away from you.", "His homelessness was not created by you. And now it's a \"him\" problem. You don't owe him anything and it sounds like he is not a stable character. NTA.", "Did he care,  when he threw you out into the night,  maybe after the last bus had left?", "NTA\n\nChalk up the loss on the plane tickets as an expensive learning experience, but you dodged a bullet. \n\nWhy can't his family send him money? Or do they do want him, either?", "NTA, your ex deserved it. time for him to grow up and figure shit out by himself without expecting anything from anyone.", "NTA and not your problem. \n\nHe sounds like a jerk and a user. You are not his care giver. And life lesson: you don\u2019t get favors from people being an AH to them. His life is his responsibility. \n\nAnd might I add kudos to you for standing up for yourself by cancelling the trip. I think you really stood up for yourself and realize you deserve respect. You did the right and awesome thing!", "NTA if it really happened the way it\u2019s being written. I think, though, something more went on. But, if he really kicked you out, you shouldn\u2019t pay for him to go home. He can figure it out.", "Please find a way to stay safe. I doubt this is over.", "NTA, but please don't try to hug people when they're making dinner. It's annoying.\n\nA few Christmases ago, I was trying to decorate my grandma's house (a tradition) and my mom decided that it was a really great time to practice being a conjoined twin. Every time I turned around I stepped on her foot because she was right there. After the third time, I snapped at her because she was literally breathing on my neck and I didn't know what the heck she wanted. Did she have something to say? No. Did she want to help? No. Apparently she just wanted to physically occupy the same space as me. She threw a temper tantrum and wanted to leave because I was being mean to her.\n\nLast night, my baby was grabbing my glasses while my husband was telling me about a house for sale in the neighborhood. I asked a question about which house before baby grabbed my glasses and suddenly she's screaming at me and my husband is **still talking** about which house is for sale. Because I was preoccupied with baby, he didn't hear me say that I'd understood which house and didn't require more information. I snapped at him because I expected him to quit talking when it was obvious that my attention was no longer on him. But, apparently the sole reason he kept talking was because my attention wasn't on him. Good lord.\n\nAnyway, my point is that normal people get upset at little things sometimes and if you can't understand why someone might get upset over a hug (definitely something that would annoy me if I'm peeling potatoes), you probably shouldn't be in a relationship. Having a panic attack over a snapped word isn't healthy. You both escalated a stupid fight.\n\nNo, you shouldn't feel obligated to pay for his ticket to Germany, but then you shouldn't have felt obligated to buy it before the fight.", "NTA. I would have lost the money too. He can borrow money from his family.", "NTA . You were nice to pay for his flights to begin with and I\u2019m glad you cancelled them as he is not entitled to your money and you may never have got it back", "NTA  \nBit unfortunate he might be homeless and on the streets, hopefully he can convince that friend to spot him so he can get back to his country. I dunno if this necessarily warrants him potentially being stuck in a foreign country homeless and without money himself.   \n\n\nBuuuut he also sounds VERY unstable (Did he have mental issues or something? Like being panicked from a hug from behind?) and he made you feel entirely unsafe. So it isn't really your concern at this point, it's unfortunate but he made his own bed with this. I wouldn't involve myself with him any further, and be careful because if things are desperate for him he may come after you.", "NTA- He made himself homeless, and you can tell him that.  Tell him that when his behavior causes everyone in his life to turn their backs on him, he should start looking to himself for answers.  Then block him and move on with your life.", "He flipped out, threw you out, and then didn\u2019t get back in touch with you for *days*? And then, when he finally did, it wasn\u2019t to lead with an apology, it was just \u201cI want your money\u201d (essentially). \n\nSounds like a classic fafo to me. NTA", "NTA. But I think if you\u2019d been able to think it through rationally, you would have kept his flight in place so that he would go back to Germany and stay there. Now you have an unstable and angry person stuck nearby and they know where you live\u2026", "Why can\u2019t his family help him with the ticket\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. You don\u2019t owe an abusive ex a damn thing", "Yep I think op needs to love themselves a tad more", "That was my thought. For no personal gain, she got rid of a guarantee of him going far far away, and probably never coming back.", "NTA. Sometimes parents send their kids to study abroad to get away from them and their troubles. This dude sounds troubled.", "NTA. He's abusive and you owe him nothing. He's trying to guilt-trip you. Don't let him.", "NTA. Tell him to just \u201ccatch the bus.\u201d ;)", "NTA. It's interesting that he was happy to boot you out the house with only a half chance you'd be able to get the bus home, but he doesn't like it when you do the same to him. \n\nCongratulations on taking back the power girl. Block the mofo and move on!", "NTA. He treated you terribly and expects all to just be forgiven. That isn\u2019t how the world works.", "NTA if he needed that ticket so badly he shouldn't have been an asshole to the person buying it", "NTA and block him", "NTA.\n\nCongrats on your escape from this relationship.", "Nta.acti9ns have consequences.  Time he leraned that.", "NTA he should have thought about that before he exploded on you and kicked you out of his friend\u2019s house. Don\u2019t treat people like garbage and expect them to still pay for your things.", "NTA \n\nClear any tjought of him from your mind. If he's a German citizen he can go to the German embassy and tell them he's homeless and stranded, or beg his parents for a flight.", "NTA. You paid for it; there is no reason for you to give it to him if he's acting this way, other than to put an ocean between you and him. He was willing to strand you with nowhere to go, so he should accept the same from you.", "NTA. I mean, there's a bus stop down the street. I hope he makes it in time. You owe nothing to him, OP.", "Definitely NTA and be glad this happened before you left for Germany. This dude just showed you who he truly was, thank goodness! He\u2019s pretty fricking ballsy and entitled to think that you\u2019d still pay for his flight home after he treated you so horribly! Karma\u2019s a bitch and he deserves everything he got from it!", "NTA\nSomeone else may have said this but my first thought was that you got away cheaply. What I mean is you found out who he really was before you flew to a foreign country where he would have a significant advantage. You were able to get to a much safer and (long term) better place, ultimately for the cost of two plane tickets.\n\nA short term expense, for an invaluable life lesson, and a priceless escape. Good luck for your future and finding your person because they are out there. \ud83d\udc95", "NTA. Besides the whole abusive interaction, it's very telling he did not bother one bit about YOU coming home safe from his town. \nYou did right. \n\n'but we need to eat, we drove ho", "NTA. Let him figure it out on his own. Dodged that bullet.", "NTA for having canceled his flight for his abusive behavior of course; BUT it might still have been smarter in terms of your own safety and well-being not to, because had you left his flight for him, you could have been fairly certain that he is gone out of the country and that this is likely the end of it.\n\nGiven how unhinged he acted, that might have been the smarter choice than having him stuck in your proximity and him doing who knows what (although it seems to have worked out so far, since you have not heard from him again).", "Honestly, it might have been worth the money for the flight to have him far away in Germany, but now that you have already cancelled it, no chance in hell should you buy him a ticket again", "YTA. Why in the hell would you hug someone peeling potatoes? My husband knows not to bother me when I'm in the kitchen let alone try to hug me when I'm handling a knife. \n\nHas he ever acted like this before because this sounds like an overreaction on your part. If you're so afraid of him now why did you cancel his ticket to keep him in tne area and country?", "Okay I'm going to go against the grain here and say ESH. It's a pretty AH move to cancel a ticket out of spite, knowing that you won't even get a refund or credit on a different flight. Honestly non-creditable flights should be illegal, airlines are the real A-holes here.\n\nIf I was in this situation I definitely would cancel my own ticket and not associate with such a person anymore  (assuming I didn't want to go on a totally separate vacation in that area). Also it sounds like the ex needs professional help, not punishment.", "'Hi so I'm trying to do something here, could you maybe not hug me for a few minutes - in a calm maybe irritated tone'\n\n**Reasonable and okay.**\n\n'Yelling and screaming then throwing your partner out on the street because of a hug.'\n\n**Not okay.**\n\nBy the way, having a panic attack over being shouted at is completely reasonable. I likely would too myself. Doesn't mean my partner and I can't have reasonable conversations about what's wrong in our situations. Adults calmly explain themselves, maybe sometimes in an irritated tone. They do not yell.\n\nStop projecting yourself onto this situation because you have a short temper, snap at people, and people get annoyed with you. It's just dickish behaviour, not something reasonable that adults do.", "And keep an eye out.  This has potential stalker written all over it.", "yeah she just wanted to hug him nothing much nothing big.", "Oh, it seems obvious the \u201cfriend\u201d was not just his \u201cfriend\u201d and he got caught out there.", "I agree with you. :-)", "My mom is like this. Once when I was 16, I was peeling carrots in the kitchen while she prepared the rest of the salad. I wasn't talking or moving, just peeling carrots. She started screaming at me absolutely horrible things. I kind of suspect she has a personality disorder based on her long history of raging (and a bunch of other things).", "NTA. Run away and never look back, go no contact. He was using and abusing you.", "NTA and you have boundaries like a badass, well done OP", "NTA, but I personally would not cancel it because once he is in Germany, you would not have to worry about him anymore, he would be gone for good.", "NTA. For as many people as there are who find themselves in a pickle through no fault of their own, there are people like your ex who truly earned their misfortune. He would not be homeless and stranded if he was a better person. (FWIW, my ex was the same type of AH.)", "NTA.\n\nHis family can figure out how to buy him a ticket if he needs to get home that badly. He is not your responsibility.", "NTA HE effectively made himself homeless by treating you that way", "NTA. Either he is a narcissist or has some other issue similar to it. Narcissistic rage exhibits itself like that, a burst from nowhere over nothing. End all contact", "NTA. He was using you for the ticket. The fact he saw nothing wrong with his behavior means you dodged a huge bullet.", "NTA\n\nHey on the positive note you're not stuck in germany with him where he *totally* wouldn't throw you out in a fit of rage and left you to fend off\n\nYup... Totally wouldn't...", "Don't worry. I'm sure immigration will arrange transportation when they deport his sorry ass. Not the asshole.", "NTA Good call. Lucky escape.", "Leave and never look back. The dude has issues and this is abuse. Do not feel bad and you need to do better for yourself", "NTA. This man has learned a long needed lesson. Don\u2019t shit where you eat. \n\nHe has family, he can borrow money from them for a flight home if he\u2019s desperate. He\u2019s not your problem anymore.", "NTA. He yelled at you while you were having a panic attack? I am so glad you left him. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be with you if he can\u2019t support you in your hardest moments. Don\u2019t contact him anymore, block him, and start living your best life. Go on a trip for yourself, if you can afford it. Do not feel bad for doing what was best for you. That was your money, it doesn\u2019t matter if it was already committed. He should\u2019ve been a better person and he\u2019d have his flight. Again, don\u2019t feel bad!!! I think you did amazing and that you sound strong and determined.", "NTA.  He wants to be an AH and he wants you to fly him back home.  He messed up and thought he could get both.  Good for you for not putting up with that crap.  Like the old saying goes, \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes\".  He now needs to either reach out to family or friends and hope someone wants to help him get back to Germany.  With his attitude, that might be a challenge.\n\nConsider yourself lucky and that you dodged a bullet with this guy.", "NTA - You dodged a bullet.  You're not responsible for him.  He's not a child and you're not his mother.  Just block him and appreciate that you didn't go with him.  It would have been a nightmare.\n\nI guarantee you he would have kicked you out at some point and would not have cared that you were in a different country with nowhere to go.  Trade in that guilt for relief.  It's more appropriate and feels better.", "NTA", "We as a society really need to get better at identifying cause and effect. She is not making him homeless. He did that to himself by verbally abusing the person who was financially assisting him and flying him to Germany.", "Are you victim blaming her?", "Nope. You don't support people who abuse you. End of discussion. \n\nNTA", "Oh no! She should care about person who abused her!/s\n\nNope, NTA. Good for her that she left him. She owes him nothing.", "Nope, she doesn't have to help someone who's showing signs of being an abuser. That's not on her to fix.", "Thats what abusers do. Glad OP is done with him. NTA", "That's why I said professional help. I agree it's not up to her to take any further action, but she should still reflect on the seemingly disproportionate nature of her response, especially if he does have mental health issues that might be responsible. He may actually love her and not intend to be hurting her, though it's still a toxic situation that she shouldn't be in.", "I don\u2019t get this line of speculation. The friend was away and there\u2019s no mention of anyone else being around."]}
