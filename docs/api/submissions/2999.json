{"id": 2999, "submission_id": "z2650x", "title": "AITA for cancelling my (ex) boyfriend's plane ticket, leaving him homeless and unable to get to his family?", "selftext": "A brief history: I met my now-ex-boyfriend while doing volunteer work. Frankly... he's not been the nicest to me. He is just nice enough, just often enough to have had me convinced that he loved me. It's easier to see in retrospect.\n\nA few weeks before this incident, I booked both of us plane tickets to Germany. He needs to go there to stay with family as he doesn't have anywhere to live here now his current lease is up. The plan was for him to fly one-way and for me to go with him for a short stay, then return home by myself. We were supposed to leave today.\n\nNow onto what happened: in between his lease ending and flying abroad, ex has been staying at a friend's house in a more rural town - and I was invited to visit while his friend was away. We got to the house and my ex started to make dinner for us. We were joking back and forth, being affectionate... and then, in one moment, he FLIPPED. I had gone to hug him when he wanted to peel potatoes, and he just started yelling. I honestly cannot come up with a bigger reason for him losing his temper aside from that hug - it was so out of the blue. And I'll admit... in that moment I had a panic attack. My distress only served to escalate his anger. He told me to get out, that there was a bus stop down the street, that I'd better hope to get there in time. I gathered my things and left, and thankfully did manage to catch a bus.\n\nAfter that initial period of shock, I realised I could never go back to him. I definitely couldn't go to a foreign country with him. I went to the airline's website to cancel my flights... and there was his booking too. I cancelled it in an impulsive, numb moment. I didn't even get a refund because it's an economy airline.\n\nA few days ago, he texted me as though nothing had happened asking for his flight details. I replied that there was no flight - that of course I wasn't going to pay to go to Germany with him after what happened. He sent a long reply saying that I knew he had nowhere else to go, that I knew he was struggling with money, and that I had effectively made him homeless and he hopes I'm pleased with myself. I honestly didn't know what to say in return, but luckily I haven't heard from him since. I don't know if he's been able to get a flight himself and a tiny part of me does worry for him. AITA?\n\nP.S. I paid for both our tickets with my own money - we never discussed this explicitly but I just assumed he would pay me back at some point. Since that it has become quite clear that that was never going to happen. This may or may not contribute to my AITA verdict - I'm not sure?", "created_utc": 1669153668, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2650x/aita_for_cancelling_my_ex_boyfriends_plane_ticket/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You demonstrated this is not how a loving relationship works. Glad you bounced. The lost money may be a sting but you are free with an informed mind. Best to you.", "NTA. From what you said, I am assuming he had been an AHole to you often, in between him being 'just nice enough '. Been there done that.

I imagine the chance was probably very slim.", "For certain. I didn't mean to imply OP had any control, I just think he probably does this more than OP knows and may be one of the reasons he's homeless and needed to go home. I'm just guessing that homeless guy is something of an a$$hole, and maybe a bit of a freeloader, and may were out his welcome pretty quickly.\n\nOP is certainly NTA nor are they responsible for this person in any way from the info in the post!"]}
