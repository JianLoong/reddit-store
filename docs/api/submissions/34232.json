Oddballs like Jordan Peterson use statements like that to segue into arguing for forced marriage etc. It's hard to snap someone out of a view point like that so if you're trying you have your work cut or for you. Some things you might want to point out to him:\n\n1) If women rejecting men based on physical features is going to doom humanity (presumably because he thinks straight monogamous coupling is the core of modern society - a common thought among Conservatives around the world) then surely men being fussy about women's weight will have the same affect? \n2) If women over a certain weight should be banned from dating.... banned by whom? Does he think the government should start regulating romantic relationships? Or should men just agree universally to boycott certain women? And if so, what's to stop someone from banning short men from dating on the same grounds? That wouldn't work out very well for a lot of men would it? \n3) Maybe he'd be better off if he focused on finding a nice girl who's compatible with him, and worrying less about other couples of different shapes and sizes who have already found their happiness. Insulting a bunch of random women because either he does not personally find them attractive, or because he is not their personal cup of tea, will neither make him happy nor get him laid. \n4) If he wants to insult women in general, perhaps he could be polite enough to do it away from you. \n\nFor yourself, however, I'd recommend maybe taking a step back from this friendship. You are not responsible for pulling this guy out of an Internet rabbit hole, and it seems likely that he'll continue to say things that will hurt you whenever you talk about this topic. Consider not putting yourself in that position. \n\nAlso, if you're tall, just be tall. Obviously, you don't have to go out with someone shorter than you if you don't want to, but your 'I'm tired of slouching' comment makes me think you're happy to date guys a little shorter than you but then feel obliged to pretend you're not taller. I'm exactly the same height as my husband which means that, depending on what shoes we're wearing at the time, sometimes I appear to be taller. He does not give a shit. My sister in law is several inches taller than her husband. They have a nice happy affectionate relationship. She doesn't slouch, she just... walks around being tall and nothing bad happens. \n\nBasically don't make yourself smaller for other people, and don't feel like you have to listen to or engage with misogynistic bullshit to win some kind of moral argument.

Men are also allowed to have preferences, such as a \u201chealthy BMI\u201d as long as they aren\u2019t also saying \u201cwomen over x-weight are trash and don\u2019t deserve dates\u201d", "She wasn\u2019t extrapolating by taking his words seriously. \n\nIn order for it to be a strawman she would have had to exaggerate his argument inaccurately. She didn\u2019t do that, she simply took his claim for what it was. He said that women over 130lb shouldn\u2019t exist. It would be extremely unhealthy and at the very least shorten her lifespan to be 130lb. That was his argument directly, not an exaggeration or separate scenario from what he was suggesting. You don\u2019t like how she put her argument, but that doesn\u2019t make her argument a strawman. \n\nAnd what root cause exactly are you addressing by nit-picking the argument of a Stranger on the Internet?", "Ok. So what does his opinion imply beyond the exact words? He wants large-scale discrimination against women if they don't starve themselves to death. Ok. So instead of actively wishing women dead, he just passively wishes them dead.", "I mean, she is being a lot more reasonable than he is. He literally said no woman over 130lb should be allowed to date. The conclusion of what he wants IS the death of her and a bunch of other women. I don't think her reaction to his insanity is even close to his blatant misogyny in how ridiculous it is.", "He said he doesn't want people dead, yet the standard he would like to enforce would kill many women. People dying to conform to his standards or never ever dating is the logical consequence of what he is saying. \n\nBut her standards aren't unrealistic and they don't even seem like a standard, more like a preference with a practical reason.", "She is being dramatic as fuck, and so is everybody agreeing that he wants her dead lol", "She jumped to conclusions for the sole purpose of being mad at him.\n\n>\u201cglad to know you want me and other women dead.\u201d\n\n>So he wants me to be anorexic and die basically\n\nAlso for continuing to be friends with him in the first place. If someone has views like that and constantly brings them up why would you entertain them.", "She's basically one of those \"short men aren't people\" women, which basically has become the female equivalent of men going \"fat women aren't people\"", "Oh yeah saying someone shouldn\u2019t exist is just sooo much better than saying they should die and is totally just a preference. He just saying that by preference a huge group of people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to exist in the world, that\u2019s such a normal thing! /sarcasm", "Ur wrong he said they should be dateless and she said so u want me to die which he did not say u reacted out of anger without properly listening to the points the commenter made which does make it a strawman", "He doesn't wish them dead, he wishes them dateless. That's not passively wishing them dead unless you buy into some of the warped incel-logic that depriving someone of dates is basically akin to killing them. Which you clearly do, but that's still very unhealthy and toxic rhetoric.\n\nAgain, he's already an ass for what he actually did say; we don't need to combine his dangerous rhetoric and your dangerous rhetoric into some sort of incelesque voltron to find fault with the guy.", "You're too kind to him. He meant 130 pounds, which is about 59kg. I don't think he realises just how little that is.", "He is being misogonistic. But how does not dating equal death?", "Women of 6ft and 130lbs are slightly underweight and far from a health risk. I'm not saying it should be the standard. I'm also calling him an AH, but saying women of 130lbs at 6ft are \"most likely anorexic\" is far from realistic and quite insulting. So OP is an AH too.", "OP didn\u2019t literally mean he wanted her and other women dead, she was making a sharp point against his shitty idea. It was a sharp rhetorical move, but given that his shitty idea is precisely and personally shitty for her because of her height I can\u2019t really blame her", "He said that no woman should be over 130lbs, and that those who are should not every get dates, I don't think it's a massive leap to say that if all women of all heights were under 130lbs a lot of them would die. Her word choice seems off I admit but that's what I inferred from what she said.", "What are you talking about? Her only reason for wanting to date a taller guy is because she is also tall. She never said anything anywhere near as extreme as \u201cshort men aren\u2019t people.\u201d", "Except she isn't, her reasons for wanting to date someone around her weight are very practical.", "That's a reach.", "I don't think she really said that though. Maybe she could be like that, but from what I can see from this post she only said that she wouldn't date a man under 6 feet because she herself is 6 feet, which is in my opinion is a preference. She really didn't say anything else about height. If her friend said that he didn't want to date women over 130lbs that would be fine in my opinion because it's just a preference, it's when he starts insulting them for no reason that I have a problem with.", "You are overdramatic\u2026\u2026 but its fine. I stand with ESH", "The goal of his statement isn't saying \"girls that weigh 130lb or more shouldn't be allowed to date\" it's saying all women should desire to weigh less than 130lb or they should be doomed to never have a romantic relationship.", "You're right, that's way less than I thought at first. Fuck that guy, her reaction was 100% appropriate.", "Also the kg in my thing was a typo on my end, I know he didn't say 130kg (that's actually heavier then I am)", "I\u2019m 6,4 and am 60kg and healthy, don\u2019t bullshit yourself \nEdit I am a dude so I don\u2019t know how different that makes it but I doubt all that much", "Sorry, it's either never dating again and being romantically unhappy for the rest of their life's, or death. 130lb is not a healthy weight for most women.", "That might be the case, but OP being his friend is inexcusable since she already knows he is >obsessed with fat women and how they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to date.\n\nWhy wouldn't she expect a bigot to be a bigot, then be surprised when it happens, and then post it on reddit?\n\nShe is probably only friends with him to get into arguments like this to prove she's morally superior.", "He obviously wasn't thinking about tall women when he said that, he didnt wish death on her. It's still a horrendous take and im not making excuses for him.\n\nOP however still decides to be his friend and is mad that he \"wished death on her\" rather than him being a blantant misogynist.", "He said no women over 130 LB should exist, you said that\u2019s just a preference. If it think that what you said was overdramatic when it\u2019s pointed out then maybe you shouldn\u2019t say it", "Yeah, \"or they should be doomed to never have a romantic relationship\" is not saying someone should be dead, it's saying they should be doomed to be dateless. The sort of people that conflate those two things disproportionately tend to end up having manifestos.\n\n(and, again, none of this doesn't make him not an asshole here, and I'd not be surprised if he's heading down your path in this regard, it's just that no, he didn't wish anyone dead as utterly stupid and offensive as what he said was)", "She said a similar thing but with being 6ft which is something guys legit can\u2019t change lmao", "According to BMI, you're well underweight, just saying. And yes, it does actually make a difference whether you're a man or a woman.", "So\u2026 he\u2019s such an asshole that she\u2019s insufferable for being friends with him? Eh I guess I could see that, but they\u2019re not even close to remotely the same level of shitty if that\u2019s the case", "He obviously wasn\u2019t thinking at all.\nHe doesn\u2019t have the intelligence or knowledge to even understand how bodies and weight work.", "But the goal of that would be trying to push women to starve themselves.", "She gave a practical reason why she would.like to date someone around her height.", "Yes clearly but OP being his friend is inexcusable since she already knows he is >obsessed with fat women and how they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to date.\n\nWhy wouldn't she expect a bigot to be a bigot, then be suprised when it happens, and then post it on reddit?", "And that makes it something guys can change?, what if he said he wanted a lighter woman due to differences in bed?", "That\u2019s why I asked OP in my first comment why she is friends with an incel anyway.", "No, that makes it a reasonable personal preference. Different from saying no woman should weigh more then 130lb"]}
