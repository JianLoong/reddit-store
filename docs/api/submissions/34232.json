Oddballs like Jordan Peterson use statements like that to segue into arguing for forced marriage etc. It's hard to snap someone out of a view point like that so if you're trying you have your work cut or for you. Some things you might want to point out to him:\n\n1) If women rejecting men based on physical features is going to doom humanity (presumably because he thinks straight monogamous coupling is the core of modern society - a common thought among Conservatives around the world) then surely men being fussy about women's weight will have the same affect? \n2) If women over a certain weight should be banned from dating.... banned by whom? Does he think the government should start regulating romantic relationships? Or should men just agree universally to boycott certain women? And if so, what's to stop someone from banning short men from dating on the same grounds? That wouldn't work out very well for a lot of men would it? \n3) Maybe he'd be better off if he focused on finding a nice girl who's compatible with him, and worrying less about other couples of different shapes and sizes who have already found their happiness. Insulting a bunch of random women because either he does not personally find them attractive, or because he is not their personal cup of tea, will neither make him happy nor get him laid. \n4) If he wants to insult women in general, perhaps he could be polite enough to do it away from you. \n\nFor yourself, however, I'd recommend maybe taking a step back from this friendship. You are not responsible for pulling this guy out of an Internet rabbit hole, and it seems likely that he'll continue to say things that will hurt you whenever you talk about this topic. Consider not putting yourself in that position. \n\nAlso, if you're tall, just be tall. Obviously, you don't have to go out with someone shorter than you if you don't want to, but your 'I'm tired of slouching' comment makes me think you're happy to date guys a little shorter than you but then feel obliged to pretend you're not taller. I'm exactly the same height as my husband which means that, depending on what shoes we're wearing at the time, sometimes I appear to be taller. He does not give a shit. My sister in law is several inches taller than her husband. They have a nice happy affectionate relationship. She doesn't slouch, she just... walks around being tall and nothing bad happens. \n\nBasically don't make yourself smaller for other people, and don't feel like you have to listen to or engage with misogynistic bullshit to win some kind of moral argument.

Some people just are legit just heavier or lighter.", "I know that, but 60kg with a height of 6 foot 4 is light, whichever way you look at it", "Oh yeah for sure, the guy needs to be worried about jumping too high so the wind doesn't pick him up like a kite.", "As a tall boi.\n\nWhen tall people hit their growth spurts and start to rocket up, bring on the 'on my, you're so tall!' comments from almost everybody. It's a bit embarrassing, especially for shy people who don't want to have the spotlight on them. Hence, a lot of tall young people end up slouching to 'fit in', plus you're going through puberty, you don't really want more attention on your changing body. \n\nI've noticed it's worse for young girls, the slouching thing, but that's just my observation.", "Sadly yes I also did this around that age! \ud83d\ude02", "> A lot of tall women run into guys that expect you to ditch your heels.\n\nWhat's really \"funny\" is that when sometimes women say they want a man \"taller than [me] in heels\" a common knee-jerk response is \"why, you're not going to be wearing the heels every single moment??\" and yet when they do wear their heels some select men will absolutely get pissy about it.", "Yeah, I may have a slight /preference/ for men taller than my 5'7 but it's not a hard line. The hard line is dudes who have ugly attitudes about being shorter/my height/barely taller. Literally some of the most attractive men I've known have been Not Tall, because they were confident, respectful, and treated me like a human being. 5'6 isn't the problem, whining about it or telling me I'd be cuter in flats IS.", "My bff is dating a guy shorter  than her by like 20 cm, but he's a short king and is thankfully not insecure, in fact he loves it when she wears heals. I honestly think that some guys really need a wake up call about the fact that in a relationship height is pretty much irrelevant (apart from some situations like OP's that \"require\" a certain height to be comfortable)", "u/CelticTigress You rock, for your self-confidence(and your awesome username)", "The bar is really, REALLY low. You cannot fathom how low the bar is.", "I am a woman and am 5 feet tall with shoes on. I HAVE dated men shorter than me, and it never worked out because of THEIR insecurities. My husband of almost 20 years is more than a foot taller than me. His height had nothing to do with why I fell in love.  \n\\*Adding info: my abusive, horrible, biological sperm donor suffered from short man syndrome. The shorter men I dated had those tendencies, and I couldn't get past that mindset.", "Oh so much this. I am TINY. 4'10 and about 102 lbs on average. Guys under 5'8 have been the absolute worst, some specifically targeting me because I made them feel bigger and of course that later translated into them trying to be bullies. \n\nGuy I'm with now is like 6'2, skinny lanky D and D nerd with a heart of gold. His last GF was over 6ft as well and he didn't care a bit", "I really relate to this like. I\u2019m so tall and I can\u2019t reach further than someone smaller\u2026", "I\u2019m almost exactly 6 ft. Like 6 ft plus a quarter inch and I get so many guys telling me they\u2019re 6\u20192 that are almost exactly my height or shorter. It\u2019s super weird.", "Admittedly I don\u2019t come across many men shorter than me just by sheer virtue of being rather short myself lol but yeah out of the few I\u2019ve met, most had such a complex about it. Like idk what to tell you man, I\u2019m short too. \n\nMy boyfriend now is 6\u20191 and he\u2019s the second person I\u2019ve dated who was tall, but his height had really nothing to do with me being into him. He knows I usually go for short dudes. Though it is nice having someone be able to reach things in high cabinets and see over crowds, I will say that much, until he places my things in higher cabinets without thinking and doesn\u2019t realize that \u2728I can\u2019t see them up there\u2728", "yea. my ex was tall, but he was 6'3. even said so on his id and shit. after we broke up he started telling people (girls) he was 6'5, saw him on a dating app... like why are u lying NOW 6'3 is tall enough \ud83d\ude2d", "I can completely empathize them putting items in places I can't even see!! :D And Happy Cake Day!", "Ive literally been that height and weight before and was not infact dead.", "That\u2019s such a wild situation! I\u2019m so glad you were on top of your health and caught that when you did and that you\u2019re doing okay now. I hope you continue healing \u2764\ufe0f"]}
