Honestly, your sister probably shouldn't come back with your nephew until he behaves better or she can actually watch him. He's 4, so weird stuff happens. He's also 4 and sticking ham into machinery and smashing electronics while Mom is refusing to take responsibility for stuff he's actively rampaged on. Just seems like the type of parent who goes \"oh well he broke x, but he's a kid and I won't pay\" if he visibly destroys something. \n\nI feel bad for your son, he just got an expensive gift and his cousin immediately started trying to wreck it. Even if it's not broken now, there's a chance the grease from the ham is eventually going to damage the internal mechanisms. Just like how your phone may work after dropping it in the pool, it's obviously not going to work as well as it could be and sometimes it takes a while for the internal stuff to corrode.\n\nETA: Just realized the controller is already visibly damaged and she's not offering to pay for that either. My point above stands.", "YTA how can you ask for a new one when this one is currently working! If it stops working, then you get a new one. \n\nAlso, if you want to get the ham out then just take it to a repair guy who can take it apart and remove the ham.\n\nThere are so many options before demanding a new one, which is why YTA big time", "ESH.\n\nShe sucks for failing to supervise and correct her kid before it got to that point.\n\nBut you overreacted. Unplug the PS, give the drive a good clean with a q-tip and isopropyl alcohol, let it dry and it\u2019ll be fine. If the controller only has a slight cosmetic defect, it\u2019ll also be fine.\n\nYou really think your 10 year old won\u2019t accidentally drop a controller?", "If there is nothing wrong with it then you can\u2019t expect them to buy you a new one. They should replace the controller though.", "NTA but also ESH\n\nA PS5 isn\u2019t cheap.\n\nFrankly, you shouldn\u2019t have had it anywhere where a small child could access it; that being said im a Father to a small child and I wouldn\u2019t let him anynear a PS5 on Christmas Day.\n\nThe small child shouldn\u2019t have been in a position to do any damage to the brand new PS5, and your sister should have enough wits about her to not let her child stuff ham into a $600 gaming console.", "Is the playstation still fully functional? Yes\n\nIs the controller damaged aesthetically or internally? \n\nIf the answer the the second question is aesthetically,\n\nY T A \n\nIf the controller is busted\n\nStill over excessive, just ask a new controller N T A", "You can get a specific solvent to clean the disc lens for a fiver. It hardly needs replacing. Calm down.", "ESH - you don't get to demand a whole new playstation when the one you have is working fine. Give it a good clean to get rid of the ham smell - good as new. Similar situation for the controller - if it still works fine, and the damage to the exterior isn't overly noticeable, no need for a new one. All that was warranted in this situation was you perhaps asking your sister to keep a closer eye on her child when in other people's homes and amongst other people's belongings. Going as far as BANISHING her and your nephew seems a feels a bit OTT.", "My young cousin once came around and crammed pokemon cards in my PS3's disc drive. I managed to get them out and it seemed to work fine for a couple of weeks then it stopped loading discs entirely. They found fragments of cardboard in the disc drive and wouldn't honor the warranty. NTA, and never let kids play with your consoles.", "ESH. Try supervising your children and not being the worst kind of wasteful consumer. \n\nAlso, if you just want a pretense for not having your sister over you could just try being an adult and telling her outright that you hate her and her child. \n\nAnd lastly, none of this would have happened if you were a vegan so maybe thing about the poor piggy who is actually the only real victim here.", "ESH \n\nAsking your sister to replace the playstation while it is fully fonctionnal is not necessary and will only increase tension\n\nOn the other hand, she needs to educate her son about other people's belongings", "Yta firstly you are partly responsible as you have let a child put ham into the PlayStation why wasn't someone watching him, secondly it still works so why would she have to buy a new one", "NTA\n\nImagine something goes wrong in the next year (for any reason), you RMA it, tech opens it up and finds a tiny piece of ham. \n\nReturn denied, even if the fault were to be unrelated to the ham incident.", "Well, if it\u2019s still okay, let it be. But if your sis can\u2019t watch her four year old,  best to wait until he\u2019s six before he comes around again \ud83e\udd37. ESH.", "NTA because something can easily go wrong later , she needs to control her son", "I would certainly not let her bring her kid over unless she supervises kid every frigging mintue", "YTA. It works fine. Making her buy a new one is excessive. Don\u2019t leave expensive toys out when you have any young kids over. Why wasn\u2019t someone supervising the 4 year old?", "ESH. I get your logic. You are concerned that while it does work fine now, there could be something the ham situation caused that causes issues down the line. Still, I think asking your sister to purchase a whole system is extreme. She should buy a new controller, sure. Maybe see if there is a repair shop that can give it a good inspection to make sure it\u2019s okay? Ask her to cover that cost? And she sucks for not keeping an eye on her kid. Some kids just can\u2019t be left unsupervised. (My kids are some kids\u2026)", "YTA, if everything is still working, you don't need a new one. Stop being greedy", "YTA\n\nBy all means give her the opportunity to get it cleaned and replace the controller. When there's a small child in the house it's everyone's responsibility to mind them. Don't tell me you'd just watch them being destructive?", "ESH\n\nIf the things works then your request is excessive; things break.\n\nAlso what was a 4-year-old doing unsupervised around an expensive new gift.  Sister sucks for not keeping a better eye on her spawn.", "If it still works and isn't broken, YTA. At most, ask her to pay for a replacement controller if that's the only real damage. But asking for a whole new PS is just BS.", "All these Y T A votes are killing me. \n\nNTA. Sony won't honor the warranty if something goes wrong in 2 weeks and they open it up and see ham juice leaked somewhere in there. Your sister should have been supervising her child. When my kid was that age, I watched him like a hawk, because 4 year olds do 4 year old things and I knew it was my responsibility to replace anything he damaged. \n\nAll of that being said, you shouldn't be telling your sister the nephew can't come back until the PS5 is replaced. You should be telling her the nephew can't come back until she will keep an eye on him enough to ensure he isn't damaging things in your home. The kid was unattended long enough to get some ham, take it to the console, get the console open, insert the ham, push some buttons, then wing a controller. That's not an accidental spill, that's your sister ignoring her kid that then voided the warranty on a $500 console.", "Is the 4-year-old a special needs kid? A child of that age should not supervision to avoid sticking food in a video game system.", "I mostly feel sorry for the 10 year old. Imagine opening up a playstation on christmas. The kid must have been extatic! Only to have his little nephew damage it right away. \n\nI dont know thw financial situation of your sister. She is TA in the story to me. As an adult and as an aunt she should apologise and try to fix the situation for your nephew. Cleaning the console and getting an extra controller for him if she can afford it. The damaged controller is still going to be used anyway. \n\nYou are NTA for standing up for your son. But you do seem to be focussing on the material side and not on how your son felt at that moment also making a slight YTA.\n\nSo ESH", "YTA. She should buy another controller, but there's no actual need to replace the console. Why are you forcing her to spend hundreds of dollars completely unnecessarily?", "ESH. Everything works fine, your request to have a new PS and controller bought is completely unreasonable. \n\nYour sister should have offered to have it professionally cleaned and should have watched her kid better. I know it is not possible to watch a kid 24/7 but a kid with food should be sitting at the table, eating and not running around with food", "What kind of ham?", "Buy a new one and put the old one in and forget about it after the return. Ugh.", "ESH. It could have got broken, so she sucks. But demanding a new one when her child didn't actually break it means you suck.", "Of all the things that didn\u2019t happen, this didn\u2019t happen the most.\n\nAnd on the off chance that it did happen, YTA for demanding a replacement of something that clearly works.", "ESH. By all means your sister should be paying for a new controller and even for a professional clean of the console, but expecting her to buy a new console when it still works fine is too far", "I agree.  The warranty is void.", "ESH seriously like your sister is obviously not attentive and responsible enough when she thinks that the fact that her four year old was able to get away for long enough to put food in electronic devices is no big deal. I definitely think that unless she changes her attitude it's not unreasonable to not have her over. It's not really about the PS, but the fact that she thinks the situation is fine - it's not. I would be worried what else will she find \"fine\" the next time.\n\nOn the other hand - since the PS isn't broken, I don't see why she should replace it. The controller maybe, but the PS works so unless it stops working soon after the incident I don't see why she should replace pretty expensive thing that her kid didn't break.", "YTA It would be fine to want a new controller but wanting a new ps when it works fine is ridiculous", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A whole new playstation for ham and a slightly cosmetically damaged controller. personally you may be entitled to ask for a new controller but your behaviour in asking for a whole new playstation has ruled that out now.\n\nhe's 4. if your child has things that either you or him don't want damaged and you have small children coming round or overexcited children...you move the items out of the way.  and explain why you are doing this. \n\naccidents happen around children. if you were so worried about the playstation and didn't move it you should have hawk eyed it. you can't expect a 4 year old to always behave like an adult and respect things. you also can't always expect parents to hawk eye their children or to know that a bit of ham and an accident is a serious crime.", "YTA\n\nYou say yourself that everything works. Why should she replace any of it? You can ask her to clean it if there is ham juice on it, but asking her to replace it is ridiculous.", ">just take it to a repair guy who can take it apart and remove the ham\n\nthereby invalidating the warranty.... \n\nESH, because OP could tell their sister to do a better job of parenting. The culprit is 4 years old and I doubt that they spend their days thinking of ways to ruin people's stuff....", "You don't have children, do you?", "ESH. Instead of demanding a new one suggest having the controller and console checked out at a repair shop to make sure there will be no issues going forwards.", "You mean why wasn't his mum supervising him? This is the home of the kid who got the PS, you can't put everything away because of a visit.\nAnd if she can't keep the 4 year old away from peoples stuff (which is totally legit, too, that some kids at some phases just can't be contained) then she shouldn't bring him to other people's homes and either invite them over or leave him with dad/grandparents/nanny.", "Like the mother?", "Tell me you don\u2019t have kids without telling me you don\u2019t have kids.", "if it was an expensive gift why did he leave it unsupervised around a 4 year old. i get parents should keep an eye on their children but if you have an item you don't want damage logic is not to leave it unsupervised in the path of potential damage.", "When I was 10, I got a PS1 for Christmas. Few days later, some family came to visit and they had a 3 or 4yo. I watched my Christmas gifts, Inc my PlayStation, like a hawk. Someone had to", "Sure they will. If something goes wrong within 2 weeks, you take it back to the store, store replaces it and sends it back to Sony and they clean it up and sell it as a refurbished PlayStation.", "Exactly, like she says it's fine, but this 10 y.o. Just got a big expensive present (which I guess he probably deserves if OP is a decent parent) and it already has scratches and has almost been damaged - like that's pretty stressful for a kid and whenever he has a friend over to play and they will ask what he did to the controller - he will be reminded that he only got to enjoy his present in brand new condition for less than a week. I totally agree - the dad is reasonable, but kinda for the wrong reason - it should be much more of an issue how his boy feels about it and that the little one could have done something worse and hurt himself while not being supervised and it sounds more like he's worried about the warranty more than the parenting side of it.", "If the mother was there then sure but OP doesn\u2019t specify the circumstances. I personally would have put the console up before the kid got there or made sure he was supervised around it.", "Exactly", "You're right.\n\nAnd how does that change the assessment?"]}
