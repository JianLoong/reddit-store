Honestly, your sister probably shouldn't come back with your nephew until he behaves better or she can actually watch him. He's 4, so weird stuff happens. He's also 4 and sticking ham into machinery and smashing electronics while Mom is refusing to take responsibility for stuff he's actively rampaged on. Just seems like the type of parent who goes \"oh well he broke x, but he's a kid and I won't pay\" if he visibly destroys something. \n\nI feel bad for your son, he just got an expensive gift and his cousin immediately started trying to wreck it. Even if it's not broken now, there's a chance the grease from the ham is eventually going to damage the internal mechanisms. Just like how your phone may work after dropping it in the pool, it's obviously not going to work as well as it could be and sometimes it takes a while for the internal stuff to corrode.\n\nETA: Just realized the controller is already visibly damaged and she's not offering to pay for that either. My point above stands.", "YTA how can you ask for a new one when this one is currently working!

Similar situation for the controller - if it still works fine, and the damage to the exterior isn't overly noticeable, no need for a new one. All that was warranted in this situation was you perhaps asking your sister to keep a closer eye on her child when in other people's homes and amongst other people's belongings.

You should be telling her the nephew can't come back until she will keep an eye on him enough to ensure he isn't damaging things in your home. The kid was unattended long enough to get some ham, take it to the console, get the console open, insert the ham, push some buttons, then wing a controller.

As an adult and as an aunt she should apologise and try to fix the situation for your nephew. Cleaning the console and getting an extra controller for him if she can afford it.

Everything works fine, your request to have a new PS and controller bought is completely unreasonable. \n\nYour sister should have offered to have it professionally cleaned and should have watched her kid better.

By all means your sister should be paying for a new controller and even for a professional clean of the console, but expecting her to buy a new console when it still works fine is too far", "I agree.  The warranty is void.", "ESH seriously like your sister is obviously not attentive and responsible enough when she thinks that the fact that her four year old was able to get away for long enough to put food in electronic devices is no big deal. I definitely think that unless she changes her attitude it's not unreasonable to not have her over. It's not really about the PS, but the fact that she thinks the situation is fine - it's not. I would be worried what else will she find \"fine\" the next time.\n\nOn the other hand - since the PS isn't broken, I don't see why she should replace it. The controller maybe, but the PS works so unless it stops working soon after the incident I don't see why she should replace pretty expensive thing that her kid didn't break.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I totally agree - the dad is reasonable, but kinda for the wrong reason - it should be much more of an issue how his boy feels about it and that the little one could have done something worse and hurt himself while not being supervised and it sounds more like he's worried about the warranty more than the parenting side of it.", "If the mother was there then sure but OP doesn\u2019t specify the circumstances.

Yeah, I\u2019m old) and asked who it belonged to.  Puzzled, I said \u201cMe.  It\u2019s my house.  Who else could it belong to?\u201d.
