Everyone has a company-issued laptop that can connect to their desktop at the office, so if for whatever reason you didn\u2019t feel like coming into the office on a particular day you could just send your supervisor a message in the morning saying that you\u2019d be working from home.\r  \n\r  \nThis past Wednesday I was a bit hungover from the 4th of July and didn\u2019t feel like going into the office, but because the weather was really nice instead of staying in my apartment all day I decided to take my laptop to the park and do my work there. (There\u2019s a private wi-fi network and tables to sit at, I wasn\u2019t just at some random spot in the grass.) \n\nAt one point in the afternoon I was asked to get on a video call with the rest of my department, and during the call my department head noticed that I was outside and asked me if I was at home. I explained that I was at a park near my house. By the way the interaction went, I didn\u2019t anticipate this becoming a problem.\r  \n\r  \nBut then yesterday everyone in the company got an email clarifying/updating the WFH policy. The rules now are that we\u2019re not allowed to work remotely unless we\u2019re sick or there\u2019s an emergency, and if we\u2019re working remotely we\u2019re expected to be working from approved locations such as home offices or partnered public workspaces.\r  \n\r  \nI asked my supervisor directly if this was because of me being at the park the day before, and she confirmed that yes, our department head wasn\u2019t happy about the fact that I was at the park when I said that I was working from home and that\u2019s why the policy was tightened up. I explained that I had no idea it was going to be a problem, but she said that I should\u2019ve known that working from home meant working from home and not hanging out in the park.\r  \n\r  \nWord has gotten around that it\u2019s my fault that we can\u2019t work from home anymore and some coworkers have  accused me of playing hooky (which I wasn\u2019t, I was actually doing my assignments) or asked why I had my camera on in the meeting in the first place. I\u2019ve been trying to explain that I genuinely thought it was fine to be working from the park but everyone keeps saying that obviously it wasn\u2019t and I should\u2019ve known I was going to ruin things for everybody. \n\nApparently there have been ongoing issues because some supervisors/departments already didn\u2019t like their teams working from home and were making a stink about it prior to this, and me being at the park was the final straw to say that the policy needed to change.

There are stories quite literally every day about workplaces tightening their WFH policies. You screwed up and ruined it for everyone. YTA", "Soft YTA. What if sensitive information was being discussed? And you were in an open environment. They are having to change their policy to prevent further issues.", "EDIT YTA. Regardless of other possible factors like the company potentially not having a clear internet usage policy prior to this the company offered work from home, the park is not your home, so yeah if you don't ask you're not allowed to. That's pretty simple. \n\n\nINFO I guess it's worth asking this. How were you connected to the the internet? What is the private Wi-Fi? Something work approved?\n\nDo you have a company PC? Does your job have any work privacy policy. Many jobs allow employees to work away from the office but there are rules about where it is appropriate.", "YTA.  Albeit unintentionally. \n\nLook, there are certain optics at play here.   The day after a big holiday, when you admittedly were hungover, you chose to \"work\" from a park.  I put work in quotes because in my experience, when people work from someplace like that, its mostly enjoying the day while having email open, not much working.  Now maybe you would've done the same thing at home.  And I fully believe you may have gotten the same amount of work done.  But the optics of it aren't great. \n\nAs someone who has a distributed company where I have to go into the office 3 days a week, but 75% of the company is remote, I'll also say I find it a bit annoying when I see stuff like that.  I'm stuck here, and you are at a park enjoying the day.  Just doesn't come off great.", "YTA for a couple of reasons. First, you drank too much on a night when you knew you had to work in the morning. Then, you took company equipment to an unsecure public park. What were you thinking? Your behavior was childish and irresponsible, and I hope you learn from this and grow up some. Huge AH.", "YTA. Working from a park, especially if you need to get on any sort of video calls, is totally inappropriate. I've worked from home my entire career, before it was a thing, and this would never have been ok with any of my superiors.", "YTA, it should be obvious any job wouldn't want people hanging out out at a park (or other public place) when they are supposed to be working from home.", "As someone that is in IT and works from home frequently, YTA.\n\nYou state that you have to use a VPN and simply request the wi-fi password from a park employee, therefore it's public domain. This is a massive security risk that no company would be okay with here. \n\nIf you want to be outside, be in your own yard. Then again, you've ruined that opportunity for everyone.", "Yta\n\nCommon sense would have told you work from home didn't mean work from *park*. I guess he ready for blowback from coworkers, because you have confirmation from management that *you* ruined it for everyone else.", "Slight YTA.\n\nI suspect they are worried about how you access the internet. When you're not at home, you're typically on an \"open\" wi-fi. I know my company warns us not to use those, like at Starbucks or the airport, and to be cautious when we do.", "YTA\n\nIf people are just logging in from wherever they are, the company can't ensure the connection is secure and private.  Which is a big deal, for businesses, which need confidentiality for a variety of reasons.\n\nThere are two parts to the new rule.  One limits the reasons for WFH to being sick or an emergency.  The second is limiting the locations for WFH to ones that are approved and secure.  The first part is petty, the second addresses a legitimate concern.", "My dude you always say you\u2019re in your backyard. YTA", "YTA\n\n>I should\u2019ve known that working from home meant working from home and not hanging out in the park.\n\nExactly. WFH means working from home, not the nearby park. There are so many issues with working in a public location; outside distractions, the vulnerability of public Wi-Fi, the risk of someone stealing the company issued laptop. This is all common sense.", "YTA.  Why would you take a call from the park?", "YTA and have ruined it for the team.  You should have also kept your drinking in check on the 4th as well so you could be functional the next day for work.  \n\n\nI am 100% remote and the idea of working in a park seems super strange to me.  If I want to be outside on a nice day, I work from my patio on my own secured network.  Too many issues with data, security, and privacy to worry about!  This is also a huge risk for the organization.  \n\n\nIf you wanted to be outside working, and don't have your own outside space, then perhaps you should have checked with friends or family if you could have used their outdoor space and then take the video call from inside or at least blur your background.\n\n  \nIf I am working from a space other than my home, I give my manager a heads-up, and it has never been an issue.  I am also using a VPN, etc for security.", "YTA. It's Work from Home, not Work from the Park", "YTA, especially knowing that the dept head would be there. What a bad look. Unfortunately your judgement/savvy is low and now the repercussions impact everyone.", "YTA - WFH means \"Work From Home\".  Not call in sick to work and work wherever you like.  You abused the term.  Also, you knew you had to work the next day, why did you drink so much?  This is immaturity not responsibility.", "INFO: What kind of job do you work?\n\nI'm leaning towards YTA because it's still a public wifi, and depending on the level of Security that your job requires not only should you have known better. Like, I personally work for a bank. They have specific requirements and such for working from home. my friend had to get a desk even for having a laptop.", "YTA what part of work from HOME did you not understand?", "YTA. Common sense should tell you that working from the park isn\u2019t the same as working from home", "YTA so few companies are even allowing it anymore yet now nobody can do it because you were hungover, didn't want to go to the office and then went to the park?", "My company also allows WFH but only at approved locations (home) any other location is subject to approval if special cases arise.\r  \n\r  \nFrom what I'm told, this is because of work injury liabilities. Which I tend to agree, otherwise what is stopping some idiot taking his laptop to a amusement park and hurts himself while he \"WFH\" on a rollercoaster? (extreme example I know but you get the gist).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's is also the data privacy concern in connecting to company servers on questionable networks. you say you are on a private network but from the companies perspective how can they trust that?\r  \n\r  \nFor above 2 reasons, YTA.\r  \n\r  \nTaking away the ability to WFH has been on their agenda, but they figured they'll start a strike if they do it abruptly without cause. You gave them an opening and they took it.", "YTA\n\nNext time just open a window.", "INFO: does your company have a vpn or any other security when connecting to public wifi?", "As long as you completed your work in a timely fashion, I would say NTA. But, you can't fight back against company rules.", "I\u2019m going to get downvoted for this, but NTA for me. I WFH too and maybe my company is just super relaxed but people take calls on walks, at coffee shops, etc. all the time. Even the CEO, VP, owners and directors. The philosophy is that so long as you\u2019re meeting your deliverables and doing them well, no one cares about where you\u2019re working. \n\nIt\u2019s such a silly technicality that makes no sense to me. You were still getting your work done. You still made the call. The only issue that came out of it was that someone in management didn\u2019t like that you were enjoying your day while also working.\n\nIf you can find one, look for a company that better aligns with your personality and values. It\u2019s a lot better than dealing with this crap.", "They are horrible bosses. \nUnless there is real danger or proprietary info leaking out from random passersby looking over your shoulder or you aren\u2019t allowed to use company laptops on public wifi.", "NTA. You are 100% being used as the scapegoat here. If your company has a WFH policy and you're getting your work done, it shouldn't matter if you're at home or at a caf\u00e9 or at the park.", "NTA. I was WFH in my last job and often worked on cafe patios, in parks, etc. As long as the work is done in a timely manner and your wifi connection is strong, your location should not matter.", "YTA but your bosses more so.", "I'm kind of confused by all the responses. I think this would have been fine if I'd done it when working from home at my last job and I definitely could have made the same mistake as you so... I'm saying NTA", "NTA. Sounds like they were waiting on any opportunity to cut back on their WFH policy and you are just the scapegoat", "NTA, this isnt the way they should have handled it. \n\nIf they came out with an email simply stating\n\"For security reasons you must be working from your own home or approved locations\"\n\nThen that would be an appropriate response.\n\nSaying no more wfh at all sounds like they wanted a reason to stop it and they are using you as a scapegoat. So rather than employees being angry at them, they blame you.", "NTA\n\nYou were following the existing policies in place.  If you were completing your work on time and with good quality then your company should be happy.\n\nThis policy was not changed because of you.  This policy was changed because it was unenforceable.  Essentially your previous policy of do what you want was wide open to abuse and management couldn\u2019t ask people to change their behaviour.  By setting rules around WFH it\u2019s now enforceable.\n\nHR Policies aren\u2019t created out of thin air in 24hrs unless you work for a terrible company.\n\nSo not your fault, your company just doesn\u2019t trust it\u2019s employees or values in office collaboration.", "NTA. Overzealous companies looking for every excuse to micro manage WFHers. Presuming nothing confidential was shared on the call in public (don\u2019t let anyone see your screen and also wear headphones) you did nothing wrong.", "NTA;  Work from home from my observations in my city included a lot of working from cafes, coffee shops, and occasionally even bars.  Your mistake was the call being on video, but management was looking for an excuse regardless.\n\nIf it was about your actions particularly, the policy would be about acceptable locations and you would get a fugurative kick in the shins.", "Should have said your internet at home was out.", "NTA.

Point being, is they weren\u2019t doing their job. \n\nI don\u2019t think wfh is bad, but if it\u2019s allowed, you have to micromanage your people and ensure they are doing their work and providing the support needed.", "How is it \u201cslavish\u201d if you\u2019re being paid? You should never assume that your employer is going to be ok with something like this unless they tell you that directly. Everyone\u2019s job isn\u2019t the same. Some jobs require complete focus so companies have to insist that you work in a distraction free environment.", "Agreed. However, the employee also needs to use common sense. You don\u2019t need an IT degree to know that the Wi-Fi connection at the park isn\u2019t as secure as the Wi-Fi connection in your home.", "Your company has clarified the policy on what WFH means. So now you know.", "If your company has a VPN required for access, that is the expectation, not using public domains... password protected or not. \n\nLet me put it this way... Let's just say that there's a hacker and that person decides to go to that park. They just ask for the password... now the company information is out there in the world and the company goes down in flames because you thought that a public domain was private because they use a password. SMH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can almost guarantee your company does have a policy somewhere stating something about public vs. private domains... oh and I'm sure there's regular training exercises for all employees to take. I don't know a company that doesn't today.", "You do know your comment is full of shit right? Let's say a cyber criminal (hacking isn't inherently bad) is on the same public network as you. In your mind, what is the criminal's next step to steal data? How is the company's information out there in the world now?", "I can accept that I was wrong about public vs private, but it was never a policy that was communicated to us and there definitely aren't any kind of training exercises on the subject or anything like that.", "Then it's an extremely small company. That's the only explanation for that.", "Were you given an employee handbook when you started? Were you asked to sign a contract? If yes, which is likely, pull it up and check to make sure it doesn't mention it. It's possible, technically, that it doesn't which would be on the company but it's not like you got fired.", "It doesn't mention it, the closest thing is about not using our email accounts for personal communications. But it is a pretty small company, so maybe that's why?", "But work from home is still home and the park isn't your home. So your company has now clarified for those who don't know what home means, what home means."]}
