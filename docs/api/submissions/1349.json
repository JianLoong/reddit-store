We moved in when we were pregnant. Daughter sleeps in parents bed and no chance she want an own room soon. I work 100% from home since years, since move in 2nd bedroom. My wife was a SAHM since birth. She now started a new job two month back in a remote job. We both work part time, daughter is in day care since a month. from Jan we\u2018ll both switch to full time. We shared my desk in the beginning but now work parallel and need a 2nd table. We both have lots of meetings. I frequently use my desk at night to do private stuff an my computer. \n\nSituation:\n\nWhen it became clear we need a second table I suggested to put it next to mine in the 2nd bedroom. My wife denied, as of the meetings. I suggested if we both have a meeting one would leave for the living room for their meeting. The one being first in the meeting would stay. In case, both meetings start at the same time we\u2018d switch or flip coin. She still denied, and suggested to put 2nd table to the parents bedroom. Now the moment came and we bought a table and my wife started requesting to move my stuff and let her have my workplace while I should work in the bedroom. She feels it\u2018s the logical thing to do as she starts to work earlier then I do as I bring our daughter to day care and sometimes she even starts before me and my daughter wake up. I said no, as I like my workplace and do stuff in the night when daughter sleeps. We also have incompatible setups so working on her place is possible but inconvenient. She didn\u2018t provide any other solution and is upset for \u201eme wanting her to change places during her work\u201c as she says she would have to start on my place and then go over to hers when I start, given the one in the 1st bedroom is considered \u201ehers\u201c. \n\nAITA for not leaving my workplace?", "created_utc": 1667588300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym77fl/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_home_office_table_to_my/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You wanted two desks in the office room. Your wife wanted one desk in the office room and one in the bedroom. It's not reasonable for her to want that whilst not wanting to be the person that works in the bedroom.", "NTA your wife isn't being reasonable. Both in the office makes more sense and one going out if you have conflicting meetings. Bringing work into the bedroom space is almost never a good idea. She shouldn't be putting things down, bringing more in and then saying you have to move.", "Just take the new desk, then move it to the second bedroom (office)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
