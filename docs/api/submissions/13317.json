First, let go of any thoughts of you only wanting/getting what you want. You will not and once you accept that you will feel a bit more free to relax. Second, you working all day does not give you anymore rights to get your way.

I wish you had discussed these things before she got pregnant, but here we go....\n\nSHE IS 8 MONTHS PREGNANT.\n\nI know this is hard to understand since you have never gone through it, but believe it or not, her body is really doing a number on her right now.  This kind of tired is different.

She's growing a whole human being ... it's hard work and hard on the body and mind.\n\nCook dinner or compromise on ready-made meals or takeout.", "She has about a month left.  You can manage without her cooking during that time.  You need to meal prep so that there is food when you get home, or order in.  Or make a sandwhich.   Or buy some TV dinners.

Taking time off to finish a pregnancy is *vastly* different from a vacation; the point of this time is for her to rest and prepare for the birth.

After the baby is born you will be needing to help her with overnight diapers and probably all the cooking.  Getting into a routine now is probably a good idea.\n\nAre you against frozen dinners?

You're so not ready once the baby is there.", "If both people are equally tired, then it's only fair to split it so that you alternate days or some similar schedule. YTA for assuming you're more tired or deserving of rest than she is when you don't know what it's like to be pregnant, but I don't think it's fair for you to cook all the time either. Be grownups and figure out a compromise.\n\nAlso, LPT: cooking dinner every day is unnecessary. Cook a big meal a couple times a week that will yield a lot of leftovers (casserole, fried rice, lasagna, etc), and prep a big salad. Leftovers + pre-made salad = 3-minute dinner prep.", "Sorry but nothing you\u2019re doing is as taxing on your body as growing a child is on your wife\u2019s body. YTA. Her hips probably hurt, her knees, feet, back, everything is loosening up at this point to prepare her for the birth of your baby and it\u2019s extremely painful for a lot of women.

As men, we cannot understand the toll that takes on a woman\u2019s body. \n\nI get that you are also tired. I work long hours at a hot, physical job and am exhausted when I get home every day. But your wife\u2019s job of growing your baby is more important than yours right now. You should acknowledge that and step up and cook dinner, for crying out loud. I cooked dinner at least 75 percent of the time during both of my wife\u2019s pregnancies. It\u2019s not that hard.", "who's gonna tell him that after the baby is born, he'll never see hot food again? lol\n  \nYTA", "Maybe try picking something up on the way home for both of you, problem solved. Obviously at 8 months pregnant this isn't a long term thing so.", "Of course, YTA. Whatever happened to people being able to feed themselves? Did I miss something, because there are an awful lot of people on Reddit who seem incapable of doing so.   \n\n\nBig fucking deal.  You're tired.  You worked.  So do a lot of people and they manage to fix themselves food.  She is exhausted from growing an entire human being in her.  She's probably swollen, every muscle in her body probably hurts.  The last thing she needs to be doing is making sure an adult male is fed.  \n\n\nMarriage is not transactional.  You need to learn to do what  needs to be done without keeping score and making sure things are divided up.  You are a team.", "Shop and cook together on weekends, then freeze meals to thaw and eat during the week. Do you have any family around who can also help cook sometimes? You don\u2019t have to have a freshly cooked meal every night. Or put out for meal service if you can afford it", "YTA. When I was pregnant cooking was so hard due to the heat from the stove and me already being hot from being pregnant. It literally felt like I\u2019d pass out sometimes. I literally had to start cooking while sitting down in a chair which wasn\u2019t safe because I\u2019m short but I knew if I had to stand there I\u2019d pass out. She\u2019s pregnant and soon she\u2019ll be healing from childbirth and taking care of y\u2019all\u2019s child. Are you expecting her to cook and clean like normal then too???

At 8 months let the woman relax get some freaking McDonald\u2019s or something.", "INFO: why is she on leave already?

Being 8 months pregnant is a nightmare.", "NAH. Since you both have a reason to avoid cooking, you need to figure out how to get dinner on the table with minimal nightly effort. Consider looking at meal-prep subreddits or websites, so that one day a week, you can work with each other to prepare the meals that you will simply heat up on the stove or in the oven over the course of the following week.

It doesn\u2019t seem like this was a problem until she was 8 months pregnant. You ever tried being that pregnant? \n\nYou both need to figure out a way that each of you can contribute. For instance, you can assist with meal prep on the weekends or during some of your free time. Precutting onions, peppers, garlic, etc is a huge time saver. \n\nDoing nothing because you\u2019re tired from work is not an option.", "YTA. You\u2019ve got another month of her being pregnant.

Dude she is almost ready to pop and that shit takes a huge toll on the body, especially at that age where she is approaching/nearing the limit for high risk pregnancies, not to mention the child is leeching all kinds of nutrients and bone mass - let her rest so she is able to grow and eventually birth your spawn.\n\nFollow up - are you planning on helping with feedings, changing diapers, cleaning spit up, and putting the baby down when it wakes up at all hours of the night?

And you will have to take care of the baby and yourself.", "NAH. You both have valid reasons for not having the energy to cook, maybe try to compromise that you each take 3 days a week and the other day you get takeout if that\u2019s an option? \n\nOr if you have one day off maybe meal prep together, you could get vegetables ready and cut up a few days in advance or buy frozen and pre cook some big batch meals.", "Yta learn to crock pot, Op.

It also sounds like it may just be best to start doing meal prep for suppers, and get into that routine because when the baby comes it\u2019s going to flip your world, especially when she\u2019ll be caring for the baby 24/7 with your all day work shifts.", "YTA.

Your lower back, hips and often sciatic nerves never stop hurting, and there is little you can take for the pain without jeopardizing baby's health. You're almost never comfortable. \n5. Your body is getting ready to give birth. Ligaments are loosening and stretching, an often uncomfortable to painful process. Braxton-Hicks contractions seize your abdomen like a huge vise, halting you in your tracks until they finish, and you're often not sure if this is \"it\" or just more practice.\n7. The baby has little room to move now, and often is pressed hard against diaphragm or lower back, restricting your movement and breath.\n8. Your hormones are also getting ready for birth. You feel differently in ways that are hard to describe. \n9. You can't wait to meet your baby, to end this phase of motherhood, to give birth. But you're also a little bit afraid. It already hurts! Braxton-Hicks suck! And the US has by far the highest childbirth mortality rate in the developed world. The rate of injury in childbirth is even higher.\n10.
