Not no social time for Bella because she\u2019s gay. The punishment isn\u2019t for her lesbian-ness, it\u2019s for SETTING FIRE TO THE HOUSE.", "YTA. he\u2019s not punishing her for being gay. he\u2019s punishing her cause she, a 15 year old, was smoking a cigarette and caused a fire. as a result, she doesn\u2019t get the privilege of having people over or going over to other people\u2019s houses. she can wait two months to introduce her girlfriend", "YTA. You\u2019re deliberately misinterpreting the situation. She\u2019s grounded because she got caught smoking and caused a fire in your house. That means she has to wait to have people over. Girlfriend doesn\u2019t get an exemption.", "YTA - You're the one being homophobic by claiming that she should get an exception to her punishment (being grounded) because she wants to introduce you to her girlfriend.  If she had a new boyfriend would you make the exception, or tell her that she'd have to wait for her grounding to be up before she can have her new partner come over?  Nothing you've written about shows your fianc\u00e9 trying to punish her for coming out.  He's just holding to the rule that she can't have someone over while she's grounded.\n\nBe a parent and don't start giving her special treatment for being a lesbian.  That can make her feel like she's not really accepted by you because you're obviously overcompensating.  Treat her new love interest just the same as you would if she was straight.\n\n(Speaking as a woman that \"came out\" as a teenager.)", "YTA. He can do a meet and greet when the punishment is over.  He didn't reject her or her sexuality.  He just held the rules due to her lack of responsibility and almost burning the house down.", "YTA.   It's wonderful that you are supportive of Bellas sexuality but there is nothing in your post that indicated your husband was being homophobic. \n\nBella was grounded for a pretty serious offense.  It's perfectly reasonable that she isn't allowed company over or has social visits during her punishment.  It doesn't matter that she's a lesbian in this situation. Would you feel the same if she were introducing a new BFF or BF?", "She started a fire, i would be pissed too, sexual orientation has nothing to do with it.", "YTA. She was grounded. If he said \u2018I don\u2019t want to meet her because she\u2019s another girl\u2019, then sure, but he was literally just treating g her the same straight or gay", "YTA\n\nHe\u2019s not being harsh with her because she\u2019s gay. She set A COUCH ON FIRE and is grounded. \n\nMaybe he could have said it better by adding \u2018but I\u2019d be happy to once your grounding is over\u2019 but he didn\u2019t have to.\n\nShe can\u2019t loophole her way out of being grounded. Once her punishment is over, have her new gf over for dinner.", "YTA\n\nI knew someone who died because their roommate set the couch on fire. \n\nIt\u2019s easy NOT to set the couch on fire. You\u2019ve got to be pretty oblivious to burn the sofa. \n\nStop being such a pushover. She needs serious consequences for her thoughtless, life endangering behavior.\n\nNice try though, her trying to get off being grounded.", "YTA. The punishment has nothing to do with her coming out. Which I hope and trust he's good with.", "YTA  \nHe's not punishing her for her sexuality, nothing you said indicates that. He is punishing her for starting a fire and that punishment was already in place. \n\nIt would been a nice gesture for him to want her to meet the gf now. But clearly he takes punishments seriously, especially since starting a fire by smoking is serious. \n\nTime for you to step back and let them navigate this, you are making things messier.", "YTA. You know he grounded her for setting a fire not for her sexuality. \n\nAlso, she is 15. Tons of parents don\u2019t even let their kids date at 15. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s an adult introducing her fianc\u00e9. \n\nShe set the couch on fire. What 15 year old had the audacity to smoke indoors and be so careless about it that they set the couch on fire.", "YTA, he punished her for setting the house on fire. Who she was dating didn't come into play unless you left a bunch of stuff out.", "YTA", "YTA, she's grounded for almost burning the house down. Should ground her for another two months just for smoking at 15, it's a disgusting, unhealthy habit. Whether she has a girlfriend or not has nothing to do with smoking and torching the couch. And get working smoke detectors if none are there or you could be the one that unnecessarily dies from the accidental fire.", "YTA. He's not punishing her for coming out. He's saying that coming out doesn't negate setting the couch on fire, which it really doesn't. \"Well, you were going to be grounded for smoking and setting the couch on fire, but since you're a lesbian I guess it's fine,\" would have been really odd thing for him to have said.", "YTA. it's good you're not the actual parent because you don't seem to be thinking straight.", "INFO: You have only mentioned what he said in regards to meeting her right now, whilst she is grounded. But what did your husband say when she told him that she is a lesbian?", "Coming out is a big thing but the way I read it is that it\u2019s being used as leverage to lesson N already planned discipline", "Yta ,First of all she smokes so carelessly setting the house on fire , I think you know what's going on and yet are turning blind eyes on the situation , my parents would have kicked me out , be thankful that she is atleast being grounded which is a really small form of punishment , they aren't homophobic , they just can't tolerate carelessness that causes their house on fire , so shut up and stop spoiling her .", "YTA. She caused a fire by smoking inside, something she isnt supposed to be doing. \n\n\nAlso, not sure if you realise but couches and sofas are treated to make sure that if a cigarette is dropped on it, they don\u2019t immediately catch fire- for this exact scenario where someone drops something. If the couch actually caught fire then that cigarette was either on that couch for a good while without being picked up or something else was going on. Matches that are dropped when lit will go out fairly quickly too so the couch shouldn\u2019t catch fire that way. \n\n\nBella could have genuinely killed herself or burned down the house. She is damn lucky she\u2019s only grounded. This is not about her sexuality or having a GF. It\u2019s about being stupid and unsafe.   Once she\u2019s not grounded her GF can come over and meet you but right now she needs to prove she can be sensible and regain her dads trust.", "You\u2018re Bella! \nYou\u2018re grounded for setting fire, Not for being lesbian.", ">But I feel like punishing her for being honest about her sexuality is not fair. \n\nSure, but that isn't what happened.\n\nYTA.", "I started smoking at 7 (it was a different time, don\u2019t cancel me) and I NEVER caused a fire\u2026. \n\nYTA, he\u2019s not punishing her because she\u2019s gay, he\u2019s punishing her because she was smoking and caused a fire in the house\u2026. Jesus.", "YTA. Her punishment was for smoking, in the house, recklessly. It\u2019s not for being a lesbian. If Bella was straight and wanted to have her boyfriend over while she was grounded and fianc\u00e9 said no, would it be \u201ctoo harsh\u201d? Did he say he NEVER wants to meet the GF? She\u2019s grounded. That usually means school/work/home not fun time with friends. He can meet her GF when she\u2019s no longer grounded. Good for your fianc\u00e9 to follow through the punishment.", "NAH. he\u2019s being fair in holding his ground about being grounded, as long as he\u2019s not trying to say that he doesn\u2019t want to meet her *at all* then i don\u2019t think he\u2019s being too harsh. as for bella, she probably shouldn\u2019t be smoking at 15, let alone inside the house", "This is entirely dependent on how he reacted to the actual coming out.\n\nIf all he said was \u2018she can\u2019t come over you\u2019re grounded\u2019, then he\u2019s TA bexause while he shouldn\u2019t lift the grounding just because she came out, shes going to remember that moment for the rest of her life, and regardless of other context, all she\u2019ll remember is \u2018my dad didn\u2019t listen when I came out and told me I was grounded.\u2019 \n\nBut if he said \u2018thank you for trusting me to tell me this important part of your identity. I love you and I look forward to meeting your GF when you\u2019re no longer grounded\u2019, then he\u2019s NTA and you are.", "You're NTA for feeling this way, but she does need to serve her sentence. That being said, it could have been handled better. Instead of him flat-out saying no to meeting her girlfriend because she's still grounded, he could have said, \"I'd love to meet her as soon as you're no longer grounded.\" That would both acknowledge/encourage her coming out to him while still holding the line on her punishment (which I do think is important).", "Not really TA but I like you\u2019re missing his point. He does need to sit down with her and have a conversation accepting and validating her and her sexual orientation but reinforcing she\u2019s grounded and after her grounding is over he would love to meet her gf", "NTA. Bella\u2018s father has so much discretion here he picked the worst available option.\n\n1. Congratulate her and thank her for trusting him with that information.\n2. Reassert the fact that she is his daughter and he loves her unconditionally.\n3. Ask her about all of the details of their relationship. How did they meet? What does he like about her?\n4. Engage her on what it means to be a lesbian in her environment. How does she feel about coming out? What\u2019s it like at school?\n5. Ask her what kind of support she might need.\n6. Yes, take one night out of two months and meet Claire. In six months, the fact that you took one night off of punishment isn\u2019t going to matter, but Bella is going to remember for a lifetime how she was treated by her father.\n\nI can\u2019t say it enough as a gay man. You are such NTA but her father and grandmother will be setting up a culture of alienation and resentment if they\u2019re not careful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Grounding her for 2 months is going easy on her. The cynical me thinks, that Bella not being able to wait until her 2 month long grounding ends, to introduce her girlfriend to her dad, is quite suspect. I mean, 8 weeks, that's all.

I am guessing fianc\u00e9 was cool because this would have been a different post other wise. If he is cool with Bella's sexual orientation- then he is perfectly good keeping the punishment.

She's grounded because she was smoking *and lit the furniture on fire!* She's not allowed to have friends or her girlfriend over right now.

My dad would have \n1. Killed me for smoking\n2. Double killed me for the fire\n3.

I\u2019m not even a lesbian\u2026", "No wonder your fianc\u00e9 is trying to be strict on the rules if you're willing to let her off of punishment so easily.  Meeting the person your teen is dating is not as important as teaching them not to smoke in the house and set things on fire.  Honestly, the 2 month grounding is light punishment in the first place, making exceptions just negates it altogether.", "So you\u2019d let your 15yr old, who smokes, inside, and set fire to the couch\u2026   \n\n\nOff their grounding\u2026 to hang out with their partner (boy or girl)\u2026 because?   \n\n\nBecause the grounding isn\u2019t important?   \n\n\nIs that how you get 15 year olds who break the law and set fire to homes?", "Why? Starting a fire is just as dangerous and irresponsible whether she has a partner or she's single. She needs to have a punishment that helps her remember not to do it next time, because her teenage brain cells aren't good at cause and effect reasoning without a consequence she can understand. \n\nEven after she started the fire, she probably doesn't understand she could have burned down the house and killed every member of her family. But she's a teenager, so she will definitely remember that if she starts a fire, she misses out on doing things with her friends and partner. \n\nYou probably just want to be the cool parent who takes her side, and that's fine if you don't mind being barbecued in your sleep. But spare a thought for the other people in the household who would prefer to die of old age.", "Wait why did you even bother mentioning her sexuality in the first place if it had no effect on your stance? Your post is written like her coming out was a main theme here, you even claimed she's being punished for being honest about her sexuality (when in reality she is punished for smoking and causing a fire), but now you're effectively saying that her sexuality plays no role in this since you would have said the same if she was straight and had a boyfriend. You're contradicting yourself here.", "So that's why fianc\u00e9 has to do the punishing, because you're incompetent.", "Why?  What exactly is too harsh about no social visits during a punishment?  Wouldn't allowing friends visits just teach her there are minimal consequences to her actions?\n\nEdit:  Also, you kind of just threw your whole 'homophobia' concern out the window if you would react the same way to no friends visits.", "That's the whole point of grounding, because it's a punishment that teenagers understand.
