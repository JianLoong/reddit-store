My husband owns a small business and I'm a SAHM. \n\nA trampoline park near us started offering 5 and under hours, where the only kids allowed in the park are 5 and under. I usually can't take my kids to the trampoline park because it's full of older kids so I decided to try it out. \n\nI took the kids yesterday and everything was going great until my youngest needed to be changed. I dug through my bag but they weren't there so I called my older two and said we have to run to the car. Before we left, I told an employee that we're just running to the car for a diaper and we'll be right back. We got to the car, diapers were sitting on the floor next to where the bag was, I put them in the bag, and we tried to go back inside only to be told by the owner that we have to pay again once we leave the building. I explained that we only left for a minute to get diapers out of the car but they told us we still had to pay. I asked what I was supposed to do because they have very clear rules that a parent/guardian has to be in the building with their kids at all times. The owner told me I should've planned better so I took my kids to the bathroom to change my son then we left and I wrote a 1 star review for the trampoline park. \n\nThis is a very new trampoline park (they opened maybe 8 months ago) and they don't have many reviews so the 1 star review did change their rating and it will be one of the only things people see when they check the reviews. \n\nI told my husband what happened and that I left a 1 star review and he got upset because he never likes to leave bad reviews on a small business because it can affect the business and the owner's and employees' lives.

What does your husband think reviews are for?", "If the policy is stupid and the owner is rude; then yeah. It deserves a one-star review. Your husband has to get over offending someone who definitely didn't give a dang about offending you.\n\nReviews are a thing for a reason. It's so people know what to expect when they go somewhere. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: clarity", "NTA\n\nThe business deserves this bad review.  \n\nYes it is a small business.  But when your target demographic is children, then you can not treat parents like this\n\nIf I were the business owner, I would have reached out, apologized, offered you some free passes, and then said that we had clarified the policy to be more accommodating towards parents who may need to step outside to change a diaper or calm a temper tantrum.  Using a simple hand stamp to show that you have already paid would suffice.\n\nThen I would have asked you if you would delete your review and write another one detailing the original experience but also how quickly it was dealt with.\n\nWhich you would have likely been more than happy to do\n\nThis business owner's policies are far too rigid and parents should absolutely know their rigid policies before they go", "NTA. If they didn\u2019t want a bad review they should have bad policies.", "NTA\n\nAs a small business owner, my business depends on good reviews, but if I treat a customer like shit like this place did, I would expect to get a bad review.\n\nPeople deserve to know that a place like that is treating their customers poorly. If they lose money it is because of their behavior.\n\nLike another commentor said, they could have gone and got the employ you originally told you were grabbing diapers, and verified your story. They chose not to. And chose to treat you poorly. They deserve the review. \n\nYou are saving so many other parents of making the same mistake", "NTA.  They never told her the policy, and, frankly, it seemed like a cheap ass money grab ploy.  Negative review was very justified.  It\u2019s not like they couldn\u2019t see you leave initially.  Terrible management.  If they are that butthurt about it, they can always try to contact you to remedy the situation, and change your review.", "NTA. What\u2019s the point of a review system if you aren\u2019t honest? The whole \u201cyou should have planned better\u201d was rude and deserving in my opinion. They can literally watch you walk to the car and back. ETA: other parents are probably appreciative of the review. They know they can\u2019t run to the car for an item left behind. They might plan accordingly or find a better place.", "NTA. They treated you like a 1-star customer.", "NTA. I respect that they want to prevent ppl sneaking in, but bracelets, stamps, etc\u2026 lots of ways to fix that. Holding fast to a policy like that is going to get them bad reviews, and it should.\n\nEspecially true since you notified an employee of what was going on. The employee should have warned you if you were not going to be let back in.", "NTA.\nIt is a stupid policy for not a real problem, they could do the same as disco. You told an employee and they didn\u2019t tell you about the policy. They deserve the 1 star.", "NTA.  That is the literal reason reviews exsist.", "NTA. \n\nThe business deserved that 1 star rating. \n\nDon't feel bad. It's on them.", "I am going to have to say NTA here because you did check with an employee first and they said you were fine. It's totally unreasonable to make someone pay again because they went to their car to get something. The owner should know that treating your customers well is how you build your business.", "NTA - terrible policy on their part - reviews will make them realize it and change things for the better - otherwise there is no incentive for them to be better", "NTA. Provide a crappy service, get a crappy rating. If they don't want bad ratings they can provide a better service, for instance letting parents fetch forgotten items without charging them double.", "NTA. Leaving a negative review that is accurate is very important so other parents who are checking out the business can be aware of what they are getting into or so they can avoid the place.  You didn't make anything up to hurt the business, you just shared your experience", "The business acted foolishly, you explained your position, the business owner doubled down on their stance, you left them an unfavorable review.\n\nSeems like a reasonable course of action. If we're going to praise businesses that exceed expectations, then the inverse must also be true. NTA.", "NTA. I don't know why paying doesn't give you the whole day there. Or why you can't leave for 5-10 mins especially if you made the staff aware (not blaming said staff member btw, I'm sure they would let you back if they could). You were definitely in the right.", "NTA - they clearly knew you had to get a diaper. And they could have told you \u201coh just to let you know it\u2019s policy if you leave you have to repay\u201d \nThey neglected to tell you so they ATA", "If you told an employee that you were running out to the car for a diaper and would be right back in and they didn\u2019t tell you then NTA. \n\nNot sure just that alone would warrant a 1 star review but the comment about planning better definitely brought it down to that territory.", "NTA", "NTA, the indoor playground near us stamps hands to avoid this issue. It\u2019s ridiculous to penalize a customer for running out to the car, it\u2019s not like you left for hours!", "They should have cut you a break, and saying you \"should've planned better\" was rude. If they want good ratings, they have to povide good service. \n\nNTA", "Ah, small business owners getting so focused on losing a dime that they cling to it and lose a whole lot of dollars. My favorite thing. /s This is a common small-business problem, and it always sucks. It's not like they're a giant amusement park; they could have grabbed the employee you talked to and verified, and then come up with some sort of system (hand stamp, receipt) for future scenarios. \n\nNTA They need to learn this lesson.", "NTA.. you literally went to grab diapers and was gone maybe 5 minutes. I get having policies, but every situation should be looked at through with broad lens.", "NTA thats a shitty policy! They need to implement a bracelet/stamp policy for cases like this. Maybe I would have called and talked to someone higher up just for clarification.", "NTA good on you warning others. A trip like that can be considered expensive for some families and they should know how shady that place is", "NTA.  I think the venue could have handled this better and made an exception. There is nothing wrong with writing a 1 star review if there is context given as that was your experience.", "NTA for the review.  The place has the opportunity to adjust their practice and write a comment under your review describing how they've solved the problem.", "NTA.\nYou should have planned better? You have 3 kids, there\u2019s no better planning. That was so rude! \nAlso, you did explain yourself before stepping out so they should have let you back in.", "NTA. You told the employee. And he didn\u2019t say anything, making you believe it is okay. AND it actually is okay. Their policy is weird. They need to do better", "NTA - reviews like yours are exactly what other parents in your position need to see. If the business addresses it to your satisfaction,  you can always adjust or remove your review.\n\nThe idea that new businesses need to be protected from bad reviews is how you get old business with poor behavior.", "NTA. That's an insane policy and if they change their policy, and offer you another visit, you can delete the review.", "NTA I understand your husband's point of view, I think it is an incorrect one. Lieing about how a bad business isn't bad enables the business to not need to improve their service. \n\nOwner cares more about your money then customer service, not something that should be hid as others will experience it.", "NTA, one star tells the owner to change or live with it. We need honesty in reviews.", "NTA, that was shitty of them. People forget things in the car all the time. They knew what they were doing and were greedy. Would they prefer that an infant sit in a dirty diaper than allow a family to go to the car? Probably. They deserved the bad review. Also they didn\u2019t even tell you that stepping into the parking lot means that an extra admission fee will be charged.", "I don't really blame you.  A new business knows they need good ratings more than an established one does so they should be trying harder. What you asked of them was not unreasonable and at least you *did* ask first and not just walk out without an explanation.  It should have been easy enough for them to have a system of stamping your hand or giving out timed tickets. Maybe they'll think about doing that as a result of your review. NTA.", "NTA you give a honest opinion about a rude owner and how you have been treated! Even if it's hard for small business that don't mean that they have a pass to be HA to costumers!", "Were you told that you wouldn't be allowed in again if you left when you got there?", "NTA. Many review sites have a way for the owner to communicate with reviewers to rectify problems. They don't want the bad review to hurt their business? Then they can contact you to say that they've changed their policy and invite you back. When I see that sort of thing I actually think more highly of a place than I do from a simple 5 star rating with no written review.", "Since the owner was there when you experienced this silliness, NTA. He could've taken a different attitude about the situation, he chose not to.", "As long as the review was truthful, NTA", "NTA.  Being a small business does not exempt you from getting truthful reviews, positive or negative.  It was your experience, and you felt others needed to know about it.", "NTA", "I'd say NTA because the purpose of reviews is to tell your opinion. You shouldn't sugarcoat a review because it might affect someone when the whole point of it is to describe your personal experience and what you like or didn't like. As long as you keep it truthful giving a bad review is never an asshole thing. Also your review might help other people out if they are visiting this park because they can plan better if they don't wanna pay again. Reviews aren't always meant to praise the business but to review your personal experience", "Nta. The employee should have informed you of this policy at that point in time instead of letting you walk back in knowing you have to pay again. People read reviews to know what to expect. You did just that. I as a mom would appreciate knowing this because I have been known to leave all sorts of things in the car. Getting multiple kids into one place while having everything you need like that is a job in it of itself. He was rude and his employee dropped the ball as well. Warranted a bad review", "NTA. The business has a terrible policy that doesn't seem to care about their customers. You did the right thing!", "nta 1 star fully warranted", "NTA, they deserve that 1 star", "NTA. Maybe 1 star is too harsh, but absent there being more to the story, the owner was an AH and you took the only recourse you had. If the owner makes it up to you somehow, you can change the review. They can also reply and leave their side of the story.", "NTA. \n\nI agree to an extent you need to be careful leaving bad reviews on small businesses but I think when there is a genuine issue, it's fair to leave one. It wasn't unreasonable to expect to be let back in. Let's be realistic, dealing with 3 kids under 5 is hard work and a simple mistake, like not realising nappies had been left in the car, shouldn't be treated like you didn't plan well enough. \n\nYou had already talked to the owner and that didn't get you anywhere so leaving a review is the next step.", "NTA.  You gave an honest review.  If a small business wants new business, they should have customer friendly policies.  Keep your review up.  Hopefully it will change their minds", "Did they not tell you that when purchasing your tickets? It\u2019s a rather common policy for trampoline parks.", "NTA the employee she spoke with should\u2019ve told her that they would not be allowed back in.", "Small businesses don't get a pass on user feedback. They still need to...you know...be a GOOD business. NTA", "NTA. Call ther place and ask for the owner or manager and explain what happened. If they give you grief, they desrve a bad review. If they apologize, take it down.", "..you\u2019re putting your experience with this business out there and potentially saving another single parent from running into the same problem. NTA.\n\nYour husband isn\u2019t in your shoes. As a business owner he feels differently and that\u2019s fine but he can\u2019t dictate how you handle your own experiences.", "NTA. Businesses should have customer obsession, especially small businesses. They know you paid, you had arm bands, its bad policy and just bad practice to reject customers from coming back in. They know bad reviews in this stage of their business is bad, they need to keep customers as happy as possible to keep good reviews and repeat customers.\n\nYou had a bad experience, you left a review to reflect that. Don't feel bad. Small businesses are not exempt from reviews or criticism.", "I don't know\u2026 it is a soft NTA for me. You didn't say if they told you that this would happen or not though. If they said it was okay to leave and then changed their opinion, they are TA but if they said no and you ignored it, you are TA.\n\nThe rule is may be there for a reason we don't know - nevertheless they should find a better solution if they want to be successful as a business. Customer satisfaction is everything. If they would be smart they would try to come towards their clients.", "NTA- it\u2019s a low move from the company, and I\u2019d like to know something like that before I get stuck in that situation too. I was the big sister dragging around her siblings by herself, and if that had happened to me- I\u2019d write a review too!", "INFO- Does the trampoline park have a policy regarding reentry and having to pay twice?", "Curious, did they respond to your review?", "If the employee told you that you could come back, then NTA.", "so a small business tyrant tried to squeeze money out of you, you left an accurate review detailing your experience at their business.

Nevermind that a bad day can ruin your life savings, but in many cases business owners are actually extorted for removing illegitimate bad reviews.
