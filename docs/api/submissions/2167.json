I'm not in the US so our grades are counted differently, but my students are between 12 and 14 years old. This story concerns a boy who is 13 and who I will call John.\n\nJohn will often ask to go to the nurse's office during lessons, usually because he says he feels sick. I've been letting him go without a fuss because if he feels sick, he shouldn't be in class. But last week, I talked to the nurse and I asked if she's talked to John's parents about him being sick so often to see if there was something more serious going on. This is the nurse's responsibility in my country, and she would normally tell the teacher about the problem if it affects class a lot, which is why I asked. She told me he's never been to the nurse's office.\n\nSo of course I realize that John has been skipping class by saying he needs to go to the nurse's office and I'm pissed, because I haven't given him any absence marks because he had a valid reason to leave. I can't give him absence marks retroactively so he has full presence in my class, despite missing 15-20 minutes every other lesson.\n\nThe next time he says he's sick and needs to go to the nurse's office I ask him if it's serious enough that he needs to go to the hospital or if I need to call his parents. He looks surprised and says \"no, I don't think so\". So I say that he can't go to the nurse's office because it's not that serious. He stays for the rest of the lesson and shows no signs of being sick.\n\nThe day after this incident I get an angry call from John's mother. She tells me I have no right to deny her son medical attention. I tell her about him missing class and not going to the nurse's office, but she says that is irrelevant as I couldn't know if he was really sick or not this time. She told me she was bringing this to the principal and now I'm worried I messed up. \n\nSo reddit aita for not letting a student go to the nurse's office?", "created_utc": 1668281868, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytgb0o/aita_for_not_letting_a_child_go_to_the_nurses/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But in the future with this kid I would do the following: before he leaves, call the nurse to expect him. When he doesn't show, then he is marked truant. At the same time you send him to the nurse, email mom about his nurse trip. Every time. Make a template email so it takes no time. Every time he doesn't arrive at the nurse, call mom or email at your break to ask if she picked him up since he was so ill he didn't make it to the nurse. \n\nInform your admin NOW before she muddies the message.\n\nETA: former teacher of same age group with a few of these types on my resume lol", "i think you should've brought it up to the principal or admin when you originally found out, like you don't know where that kid is and god forbid smth actually happens to him, then he wouldn't be able to use the excuse to his parents", "Do you have aids or proctors at your school? I would have a staff member escort this boy directly from your class to the nurse\u2019s office. Every time he asks to go.", "NTA - He cried wolf too many times, you called him on his bullshit. His parent is continuing to defend his crappy behaviour because he went home and whined, instead of recognizing that her child being deceitful is the bigger problem. I'm sure your principal will side with you, when you explain the situation. \n\n\nJust next time, call the mom with your 'concern' before the kid has a chance to make you out as a villain - \"Hi Ms X - just wanted to make you aware, little X keeps truanting lessons claiming he is unwell but the nurses have no record of him visiting them. He did ask again today but he seemed well, so I asked him to stay in the lesson. Could you speak to him about the importance of not missing his education because I'm concerned about him falling behind or failing.\"", "NTA.. But we're talking borderline . Sounds like the class needs another lesson in The boy who cried wolf. Although next time I would do this differently and take one of the many suggestions of sending somebody with him, getting confirmation from the nurse that he showed up, as well as contacting his mom.\n\n I have all of my kids's teachers in my email and if they have any concerns they can email me quite easily. As a mom we can only correct issues that we know are happening. If my kid came home and said that he was not allowed to go to the nurses office and I had not heard of him ever being sent to one then I probably would also have my hackles on end. She's also not completely wrong that past issues are irrelevant, how would you feel if he had suddenly thrown up all over your floor? Remember in the boy that cried wolf story, the Wolf eventually shows up... She should have been contacted the moment you noticed that there was an issue.. And I'm talking on your way out of the nurse's office a phone call or email should have been being done. You should have also went directly to your principal/administrator and let them know of the issue and what little John had been doing.", "NTA, I don't think you're an asshole for this. I think you could have maybe called the parents/guardian to discuss it as soon as you found out about it instead of waiting to discuss it after denying the nurse visit though. I think that will give the mom time to hear the kid's story first and you know the parent is always going to give the kid the benefit of the doubt unless the kid is already just very clearly a \"bad apple\" and always getting into shady stuff (and even then they might still take the kid's side if presented first. A parent's love is strong y'know? Can't fault them for wanting to see the best in their baby) Regardless, I don't think you're the asshole.", "NTA. If he was really sick, then he would have had you call his mom.", "Ehh, NTA but you need to come up with a better solution for how to handle this than denying him access to the nurse. As much as we all know little John isn\u2019t really sick or going to the nurse, it just comes back negatively on you when his parents hear about it, as you\u2019ve just experienced. You definitely should have immediately alerted his parents as soon as you realized he wasn\u2019t actually going in the first place. That way everyone would have been on the same page. But for future, maybe have a staff member or even another trusted classmate escort him to the nurse to make sure he gets there. I\u2019m sure once he figures out that he actually has to go to the nurse\u2019s office, he will find himself feeling much better.", "As a fellow educator, you sadly are going to get a YTA.\n\nBUT, I have to solution!  As he leaves, call the nurses office on your classroom phone, loudly... (talking outloud while emailing the nurse is also nice because paper trail!)  \n\nAlso, my school allowed us to send a student with a sick student to the nurse.", "I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole for that decision but the mother is absolutely right. Irrelevant of past decisions and actions on your students part you can\u2019t deny requested medical attention. He abused the system and took advantage of you but it\u2019s not a privilege to see a doctor it\u2019s a right. You\u2019re also not all wrong and he was almost certainly lying again you just have to go about solving this situation differently.", "YTA. A safer way to handle this would be to have him \"escorted\" to the nurse's office (by a responsible student maybe) and ask them to have the nurse send a report back because you're concerned about John.", "John is the boy who cried wolf.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nClassic boy who cried wolf scenario, his truancy has just made it harder for others to go the nurse when they need to, and I'd explain as such to the principal.\n\nNext time he asks, I'd either:\n\nA: Call the nurse before hand so she knows he's expected, and if he doesn't show up then he gets marked truant. \n\nB: Send a responsible student or teacher aide (if you have one) with him so he can't wander off.\n\nEither way, email the mom so she knows that he's \"sick\". \n\nIf it's legit, then your helping the kid by being proactive. If he's lying, then now his mom has this to deal with and will probably take steps to reprimand him (hopefully).\n\nAlso, contact the Admin ASAP so she doesn't muddy the water.", "NTA. As someone who also works in a school, I've had the same issue with students who decide to get out of class but never actually make it to their destination. In my school, such actions would be reported to the principal for disciplinary actions for cutting class. They'd also probably be put on restriction where they aren't allowed to leave class without an escort to make sure they get to where they're supposed to go. We can't deny letting a student go to the nurse even if we know they're faking sick, so in that case we call the nurse to let her know the student is on his way so if he doesn't show up, she can send someone to look for him and then he can deal with the principal if he's roaming the halls. I'd definitely try to loop in your principal or supervisor to create a rule for the student leaving the classroom going forward so everyone is on the same page.", "Why are you writing to Reddit about this? This isn't about whether you are an asshole, it is about whether you are a competent professional. \n\nSurely your school has Policies and Procedures about what to do in situations like this? If you have any doubts about what the policies mean you should be talking to your superiors - then do your job.", "NTA. It sounds like his\u2019 parents allow this behavior. Next time see if you could get an escort for him to the nurse\u2019s office so that he can\u2019t just leave. I am assuming school personnel have a responsibility to ensure students stay on property until dismissal, so maybe call the nurse ahead time if you can\u2019t send and escort and let her know he is coming and if he doesn\u2019t go mark him absent.", "YTA: While your reasoning is sound, the mothers point is correct, and you are not trained in medical diagnostics. This is not to say you should presume the kid is being honest, but perhaps call the nurse or other staff to your classroom, or work with your administration to form a plan that will protect you from potential liability.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t get to deny the kid access to medical care.\n\nOptions:  Tell him that you will be calling the nurse to let them know you are on your way.  Or that he needs to bring a note from the nurse the next day.  Or that you will send another student to escort him to the nurse.  Or that you will check in with nurse after his visit.  Or tell him you know he hasn\u2019t been going to the nurse and both you and the nurse are aware of the issue.", "YTA. How are you being petty and immature with a literal child? The mature thing to do here obviously would have been to sit down with him, 1 on 1, and ask him about it. \"When you're asking me to leave class and go to the nurse, you're not really going to the nurses office, are you? What are you doing? Why? \nIs there something I can help you with? I can't knowingly let you skip class, but if you need snacks or you need a little time to yourself, we can work that out, but I need you to be honest with me. \" \n\nI'm sorry, but it makes me uncomfortable that you are a teacher.", "NTA. Next time he asks to go to the nurse\u2019s office get some other students to escort him there. Make sure the students escorting him aren\u2019t his friends cause they might let him skip class again.", "YTA.\nFor never once checking to make sure he went to the nurse. \nFor not walking him to the nurse but instead refusing. \nYou handled this very badly and you're embarrassed that a child got over on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then you would have fucked up big time and this could cost you your job. \n\nSo don't forbid from from going but make him provide proof that he went there and share that with his mom and with the principal.\n\nAnd I'll also add: as someone who used to go to the nurses office a lot when I \"didn't need it\", it turns out I actually did. I wasn't really physically sick but sometimes something happened in class and it gave me anxiety and my way out was to pretend I was sick (I don't even really remember this - I think I sad younger than 13 - but I ended up seeing s therapist for other reasons and she shared this with my mom - and my mom shared it with me some years later).
