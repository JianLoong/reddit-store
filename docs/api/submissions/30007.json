Well, I wish a pacifier would work. I did get them a sound machine, I got melatonin, CBD gummies, I researched vitamin deficiencies and got them magnesium and other supplements to help.

We are actually very compatible in bed, which I think has been one of the main reasons we have made it this long in spite of our differences.", "Yeah, it caught me off guard when they said that. I asked what they meant, and they said that I was making them lose sleep, which could lead to all sorts of physical ailments, and that I was increasing their risk for alzheimers (they're late 40s, so...), which...I don't know.

I am feeling emboldened by these responses, and I really appreciate your insight.", "I am hoping that there can be a resolution with therapy or other measures. I don't want to divorce, but I do want respect.", "Absolutely. They could definitely help out more around the house, with the kids, etc. In the past, it has always just become an argument to the point that I don't ask anymore.

Growing up in an unstable home gives us a warped idea of what a healthy relationship looks like, makes us feel that we are undeserving of better treatment, and/or causes us to avoid conflict at all costs. You are very much not alone, there are countless people who are and have been in very similar situations to you. The fact that there are children in the mix makes it even more complicated, and difficult to walk away.\n\nThe important thing is that you recognise that this is a pattern in their behaviour, and it's not good for you. I would strongly recommend getting in contact with a domestic violence helpline for support. That might sound overdramatic, and you may think \"but he's not being violent towards me\", but those organisations can help you make a plan to get out.

Trauma bonding equates history or ongoing abuse. Is there hesitation somewhere on naming what is happening?\n\nI wonder if you framed the problem as the \"not able to sleep\" thing when another part of you realised that you have made yourself as small as possible (so to speak) to avoid confrontation for so long but now with your doctorate and job, there is a possible door to exit this poor relationship? \n\nWhen did this behaviour of his appear? \n\nAs your hope grows - your excitement about your job is clear in your post - what has been his response both in his behaviour and emotions towards you?", "This is going to sound a bit farfetched, but would it be possible for you to rent an office co-working space in your area?

I can say, I know that our children see our relationship and do not wish to emulate it. They have said as much in private conversations, like, \"Oh, this will never be my life,\" in jest but...not.

Our abuse looked very different, but it was something that we both came into our relationship with a lot to learn and a lot to heal from. I say it, too, almost as a joke, that our rocky relationship feels a bit like trauma. In that, we've stayed together this long, so why not longer? Genuinely, that isn't the only reason that we are together, but we have had conversations before about our relationship feeling like a work in progress even after all of these years. Their behavior is consistent, however. It is mine that has changed, which has induced this current situation.", "Yes, I will say, as I sit here thinking about it, the general feeling I get when I discuss my research is less than positive. Almost dismissive. I think we have a lot to work on, and they need to change their perspective and respect boundaries. Thank you for your advice.", "Thank you, genuinely. I felt so crazy trying to justify myself to them, but I have realized that they aren't actually listening to me. They only hear their own wants.", "Thank you for understanding. I appreciate your kindness in helping me answer others. :)", "This hit me pretty hard, I'm not going to lie. Saying that I'm not the one breaking up the family is...something I think I needed to hear.
