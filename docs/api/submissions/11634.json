From the beginning of planning, we decided that we didn't want much help paying for or planning the wedding. We wanted this day to be for us. \n\nFast forward to the trip, my MIL, FIL, BIL, as well as my best friend and her boyfriend, and my husband and myself all arrived early in the week and were staying til Monday. Most guests, including my parents and sister, were staying from Friday-Sunday. \n\nI was in a group chat with my family and they had made a plan to go to a town about 30 minutes away for dinner. I was a bit confused by that being there was a restaurant on-site and they had just been driving all day. Granted, that restaurant is hard to get into because it was around the holidays and you need a reservation (also if you make a reservation but don't show up, it costs you $25/person and you can only reserve up to 10 spots under your name). So I bought a bunch of pizza and had it hot and ready in the lobby for people to eat once they arrive. \n\nMy in-laws had a reservation at that restaurant for 7:30pm that Friday night that was supposed to be for my husband's family, but a lot of them ended up getting sick and cancelling so they had a lot of extra seats to fill. So they offered the spots to the people who had come early in the week, myself and husband, plus my parents (who said no). \n\nWe show up at the restaurant and my family (including my mom) is already there giving me the stink eye because there was a whole section for my in-law's reservation but my family (like 20 people) were sitting by the bar, which was in the same room!  I went over to them and they gave me the cold shoulder. My best friend stood up to give a toast and none of them turned around to even acknowledge it. I went outside very upset and my family ended up leaving to go to the Chinese restaurant down the road. Apparently, they were talking shit about me saying they wish they hadn't come because I \"planned the weekend poorly and they expect better treatment.\" \n\nMy birthday was a few days ago and this all came out with them saying I looked bad for not having seats for them. \n\nTwo things to note: I had pizza for them in the lobby and they said they were going to some German restaurant.\n\nEdit to include information from comments:\n\n- I was not invited to my family's dinner and my parents elected not to attend as well\n\n- My family planned the dinner weeks in advance and they chose to change plans the day they arrived\n\n- Typically in my family we all vacation in an area and independently (or in small groups) find and plan things to do\n\n- We stayed in the lobby with the pizza until all of the guests arrived at the hotel and then went to the dinner reservations with my husband's family\n\n- My husband's family offered to book additional reservation space at the restaurant on-site but given everyone was showing up in about a 5 hour window and my family made other plans already we didn't do it", "created_utc": 1678108251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jyjkp/aita_for_not_planning_out_an_entire_wedding/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Gently because I don\u2019t know if this was ignorance or intentional oversight but..\n\nYTA.\n\nUnfortunately when you make a destination event which is not very close to other venues, you should at least provide avenues for people to eat, and find some entertainment. You don\u2019t necessarily have to pay for everybody but it would\u2019ve been nice for you also to ask your relatives if they also wanted a reservation at the restaurant. You admitted it was busy and for them to find out last notice that the only seating they had was at the bar did not sit well with them. Not that they sat at all anyways. \n\nYour in-laws kept this in mind and made reservation for their side of the family to be able to have a meal, and you didn\u2019t have the same consideration.", "YTA\n\nSo inconsiderate lmao, you booked an inconvenient venue and had nothing prepared for guests? You lack basic etiquette. Actually, even your inlaws aren't supposed to make their own reservations themselves in the first place. How out of touch are you, and you have the audacity to feel upset lol.", "YTA - this was poor wedding etiquette and inconsiderate. You had a destination wedding, so you should have had something for the guests that night - cocktail party or even some sort of guide giving options, etc,. But you left some pizza in a hotel lobby? Thats honestly a little tacky.", "It seems like there was a serious miscommunication and misunderstanding of expectations here. I would never expect to go to an out-of-the-way destination wedding for an entire weekend that somebody else planned and expect to be served pizza sitting in the lobby, and would certainly want to know if there wasn't much food available locally, even if it was just on the wedding page or whatever.\n\nI also think that you're failing to communicate properly even in this YTA post; you're not being treated poorly for not planning out an entire wedding weekend, you're being treated poorly for failing the basic task of ensuring your guests have food appropriate to the event they are attending.\n\nI'd say that YTA here, but more out of apparent cluelessness than anything.", "Info: why did they decide to go to the on-site restaurant instead of driving 30 mins away like they had told you they were going to?", "Any destination wedding I've been to I've been given a schedule of events before going. Some are long and some are like enjoy the beach and see you at the wedding. Sounds like you had your plan but it wasn't communicated.", "So... the reason your family is pissed at you is because you showed them you cared nothing for them. Your in laws thought to get you a table at his restaurant and the only thing you did for your side is give them pizza in the lobby. Pizza in the lobby verse a really nice restaurant.... put yourself in THEIR shoes and you might understand a bit.", "you had pizza in the lobby but your husband's family had the wherewithal to actually book a reservation for their family, and you wonder why yours was upset. I don't think you had to plan the whole weekend but to have pizza just sitting out for them and not at least one thing organized is a mess.\n\nYTA- I can see why they had an attitude", "YTA. Your minimal planning didn't even let people know that dinner reservations would be hard to get at the end of the trip. And your guests arrive to see pizza for THEM, while the HOSTS are comfortably ensconced in the restaurant.", "Soft YTA. You were not required to plan and pay for this huge elaborate weekend, BUT, you were required to *communicate* the lack of a plan to all guests. People had no idea what was going on or where to go, they made assumptions about plans based on the opposite side of the family. You should have made it very clear to all guests that they are on their own and then have been totally ok with their decision to go to a neighboring town or not wanting to just grab a pizza slice after traveling. This all sounds very disorganized.\n\nYour guests are being immature. But you definitely could have just communicated the expectation a lot better.", "YTA because like\u2026 you threw pizza at them like they all got a passing grade on a middle school math test.", "Yta.  You failed to plan or communicate.   Your guests should not have to worry about food after driving 10 hours to get to your destination wedding venue.  Sitting down to eat a nice meal with your in laws while your family ate pizza in the lobby or sat at the bar was a real slap in the face to them.", "YTA \n\nWhen you plan a destination wedding, you need to step up and host. You took the lazy route under the guise of \u201cunconventional\u201d and people were rightly pissed off.", "YTA. You had to have a wedding that was a ten hour drive away and refused help planning out the wedding. That would have been fine if you had a plan, which sort of sounds like you didn\u2019t. Especially when you consider only the in-laws had reserved seats. There was probably an awkward encounter with the hostess that you weren\u2019t there for when they tried to explain they belonged in that section and the restaurant tried to be accommodating. Chances are they wouldn\u2019t have had to do that if you\u2019d called the restaurant to explain you needed a larger reservation or you would need to pick somewhere else. \n\nAlso, pizza is not a full meal, especially after traveling for 10 hours one way. That\u2019s a thank you gift you give to your friends for helping you move.", "Yta you had multiple people try to offer support or guidance to prevent these kinds of blunders but you knew best.", "YTA\n\nStandard wedding programming involves a rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding followed by welcome drinks.\n\nYou didn\u2019t plan anything of that sorts. Which, fine maybe not your style. No one has to do the rehearsal dinner stuff if they don\u2019t want. Though it is pretty damn tacky to have a destination wedding and not have some sort of event the night before for the people who take the time and money to travel ahead of time. And no, lobby pizza isn\u2019t an appropriate welcome event\u2026this is a wedding and not a college orientation. \n\nBut then to make it worse, you showed up at the restaurant to what was a reservation **just** for your in-laws. Your own damn parents were only invited as a last minute seat filler. They turned it down because they were rightfully insulted to be treated as an afterthought. Plus, your best friend giving a speech pretty much made the dinner into a rehearsal dinner even if that wasn\u2019t the original intent. \n\nSo in the end, it looks like you planned a rehearsal dinner **just** for your in-laws. You threw a last minute invite to your parents, who should have always been invited, and are shocked your family feels insulted?", "YTA. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re arguing in the comments. You came here for judgment and you received it. You should have planned an evening together for all of your guests. That\u2019s great you had a pizza snack but showing up at the restaurant did look in poor taste from your families side of things. Whether you meant it to or not, it does appear like you made plans with your in laws and not them. The kind and proper etiquette would have been planning a rehearsal, get together, or dinner reservations for both sides.", "This is one of the hundreds of reasons why weddings suck, especially destination weddings. Maybe you\u2019re not the AH. Maybe weddings are. I\u2019d be cranky too if I had to drive 10 hours and be stuck in this situation. YTA", "Yta look, if you want to be 'sporadic, nomadic, fly free in the wind' hippie, go for it. Have fun. But then you don't plan events 10 *hours* away and refuse to actually plan and host the event.", "YTA. It\u2019s customary for a wedding website to have relevant information for guests who are coming from out of town. This absolutely applies to a destination wedding where presumably everyone will be from out of town. \n\nThis includes food options and info, such as \u201creservations required\u201d, transportation info, and some sight-seeing or activity information.", "**YTA**\n\nYou had a destination wedding 10 hours away from where anyone lived, in a small town/resort area, and didn't make meal arrangements for people outside of the actual wedding beyond ad hoc \"pizza in the lobby\" that you apparently arranged at the very last minute and seem to think was incredibly thoughtful and generous of you. \n\nYou keep justifying this by saying \"my wedding was unconventional\". Unless you're using \"unconventional\" as a very odd synonym for \"thoughtless\" or \"self-centred\", your wedding wasn't unconventional, it was just poorly arranged and you were a very rude hostess who left a lot of guests to their own devices in a place where they literally came entirely at your behest, and meals were not easy to come by. Of course YTA.", "YTA - Dinner the night before a wedding is arranged for the immediate family even if the wedding is destination and it includes all out-of-town guests. For an out of town wedding it is common courtesy/etiquette to host one - usually by the grooms family. \n\nThat being said, your family should have asked in advance, and they are being extremely rude in their response. \n\nThe absence of a planned dinner seems to be an oversight on your part - but their response is out and out rude to the extreme.", "NTA. My guess is that they feel like there's some kind of favouritism with the in-laws and are unaware of the logistical restrictions but their reaction seems kinda bratty tbh. It's fair to have guests do their own thing the night before a wedding.", "NTA \n\nyou made sure there was food for when people arrived. \n\nI don't get why people get so piased about not having an itinerary. You have the wedding stuff but leave rest open for GASP people to do their own thing. \n\nHow many people after a 10hr drive say oh can't do dinner I am to tired. How many say can't do dinner am sleepy or need to relax. And yet the brides the aas for not making reservations and maybe having to PAY more for those who drop out instead of leaving the first night people show up to do their own thing. \n\nThe GROOMS FAMILY did reservations not the groom so they took care of themselves. Her made reservations at another restaurant and then didn't even go but stayed to give her the cold shoulder.\n\nI think people's expectations to have every min planned out is bullcrap. We are adults who can explore and do things on own own. Not expect a bride or groom to do it all like that. To say I expect better treatment says entitled to me because that means doing what THEY want and having hands held. It was a freaking dinner for gawds sake. The first night people started showing up.", "NAH.  You had a plan (pizza) and they had a different plan to go somewhere else, so it just seems to be a case of bad communication all round.  In retrospect it would probably have been nicer to book somewhere for everyone to go together, but hindsight isn't much help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand you\u2019re trying to say it was a low key, free to do what you want wedding. Which is great if it\u2019s a backyard affair. But when you host it between holidays and do it as a destination so people have to make a weekend out of it and likely not have holiday getaways of their own\u2026.well you need to adjust how you handle things. A greater obligation to guests is owed than normal. \n\nShould you mandate what people have to do? No. But making arrangements/offers is generally considered the polite thing to do. Rehearsal dinners are also fairly common in this situation. It\u2019s a thank you for traveling so far to join us, dinner is handled, guests aren\u2019t paying, let\u2019s make things low stress for the traveling guests. And the thing is, I think you understand this. You ordered pizza recognizing people would be tired and it was kind and appropriate to offer them food upon arrival. You just didn\u2019t do it in a great way. You could have made arrangements for a real dinner. Everyone was going to need to eat. You could have had people rsvp like they did for the wedding if a head count was required. Or you could have thrown a low key pizza party with salad and wings. But you needed to tell people ahead of time so they could plan on it. \n\nAs it is, even if it wasn\u2019t plan A for you to be there, your in laws thought ahead and made plans. Your family didn\u2019t. But they saw you with your in laws enjoying the benefit of a well thought out plan. They were at a bar hoping to get a seat and some food after traveling almost half a day for you. The optics are, quite frankly, terrible. If nothing else, I would hope you could acknowledge why your family felt like unimportant afterthoughts in those moments.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't have to plan and pay for everything, but you do need to be a bit of a travel agent for your guests. \n\nEvery destination wedding I've ever been to has included some sort of welcome situation and advice on where to eat/things to do. So I went to a wedding in Tahoe at a resort, so they said- you need reservations to eat at the hotel restaurant, here are some other local places we love, and on Thursday night there is a weekly town outdoor festival which you may enjoy, located at X. That kind of thing. \n\nHow did your inlaws know to make a large reservation at the restaurant, and why wasn't that kind of information passed on to your parents? For example, if the inlaws figured that out themselves, once you found out they made a reservation, you should have called your parents and told them about it/asked if they wanted to do the same. \n\nThen you find it \"odd\" that they were going to go to a German restaurant when your story is literally about how they couldn't eat in the hotel restaurant. And pizza (which is only \"hot\" for a period of time) isn't a full, nice meal. \n\nAnd then, your friend stood up and gave a speech at the restaurant, making it definitely seem like a planned, wedding event, that you didn't bother to invite your family to.", "YTA. If you choose to have a destination wedding then you must put extra effort into being a gracious host. This means a lot of additional planning and communication. First and foremost should be your guests\u2019 comfort. They are traveling quite a way at your request, to celebrate you, despite the great inconvenience to them. You can\u2019t just let them flounder because you want to chill. A good host doesn\u2019t get to chill when planning a multiple day, out of the area event.", "YTA and deliberately obtuse here and unwilling to accept judgement. You asked all these people to drive out and then had nothing planned for them.", "A soft YTA - when you have a destination wedding, people come for you, not the destination. It\u2019s customary to plan at least a couple of activities for people over the weekend. But they also seem to have really overreacted to what was an unintentional oversight.", "YTA but not intentionally. I get that you wanted a chilled event but unfortunately there are etiquette expectations when you plan a destination wedding. Even if you wouldn't care about it in their shoes. If you ask people to turn up the night before, then you need to plan food. Not just leave them to it and go 'Oh they already have plans so that alleviates me of responsibility'. You should have notified them of food options and offered to help with booking. Just like your in laws did for their guests. If they THEN chose to do something else, it's not on you. But you never stepped up until right at the end, when you thought of a pizza snack and offered restaurant space on behalf of your in laws.", "Yta. Why didn't you both making reservations for your guests?", "EXACTLY - you dont have to break the budget here or really even pay but there should have been some effort put into giving information to people and potentially finding a way to gather those who were there.", "This! OP, YTA. Its courteous when planning a destination wedding to at the very least provide a list of options for people to do/eat when not at formal RSVP\u2019d events. \n\nThis could have been a simple page on your wedding website that indicates \u201cDining on-site at Cafe Disorganized is limited; reservations are highly encouraged. Other options within a 30-minute drive include General Tsos Chinese Cafe and the Shnitzel Shop. We will provide pizza and wine upon arrival in the lobby.\u201d \n\nYou gave your guests no plan or support in making plans, and then got grumpy that they went out of their own accord because they wanted a solid meal after traveling 10+ hours.

Even for myself and my husband. We weren't supposed to be there, but it was a last minute change. The rehearsal was a breakfast in the morning. So I think the whole situation was just strange and the wedding was very unconventional.", "I'm not trying to argue, I'm trying to understand. My wedding was not supposed to be something planned out. It was a do whatever, show up whenever, just chill out type of ordeal until the ceremony. I wanted my family to go and explore the area.

You told your family not to help and as a result, you created the circumstances for this fuck up. \n\nNone of the details about the illness or cancellation fees matter. Think of this as a personal PR nightmare as the issue comes down to optics and perceptions.

I get what your ideal plan was, but this is not how weddings typically go. If you wanted something different from the status quo then it should have been heavily communicated. Even not having a plan, needs to be planned. For example Itenirary: Friday: guests arrive, welcome pizza and checking in, then everyone do their own thing for dinner. Saturday: everyone on own for breakfast then getting ready at 12pm, ceremony at 5pm. \n\nYou showed up at reservations under your in laws name. It looks like from your families point of view, you made plans with one family and not the other.

Everyone knew that when they signed up for it because it was communicated in the invitation.", "You are being willfully obtuse here. When you planned the wedding you should have put more thought into what your guests where doing for the weekend as you were making them travel 10 hours for your wedding. \n\nYoure here for judgment btw. Just a reminder.", "They made plans at a destination wedding before knowing there was a destination wedding going to happen? Obviously not.\n\nYou didn\u2019t make plans so they made their own, that\u2019s the problem. Stop pretending to not understand.", "They told you they had plans because you didn't bother making any. How do you not see this.", "Odd because 21 hours ago you were estranged from some of them\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11j4m5l/aita_for_estranging_myself_from_my_family/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "So you understand that just b/c you like to wing it, not everyone does. Your guests are not you.\n\nYou are getting the answer to the question you are asking and why. \n\nYou need to accept that many of your guests feel the same way as the people who are calling you TA.\n\nWhat did you expect your close family and friends to do? Not attend your wedding? They wanted to support you, they wanted to be there, but you demanded quite a bit from them w/o doing much in return and that is pretty frustrating.", "I am not making anyone do anything. If people are not feeling comfortable making a 10 hour drive, I understand. I don't twist arms for people to go to my wedding or else.", "I'm completely okay with people making plans of their own. I did not have plans for that weekend myself. It was literally, I'm chilling out and showing up to my wedding. And honestly, it was the most relaxed wedding I've ever been to and it was my own. If I'm not making plans for myself, I'm not going to make plans for other people. I feel like it's too stressful and controlling", "You\u2019re having a destination wedding and these aren\u2019t just *people*, it was your literal biological family that wound up getting pissed at you.", "I don\u2019t believe this one bit. You got pissy that they didn\u2019t pay attention to a toast by your best friend that was happening at a meal they didn\u2019t feel welcomed at. \n\nYou\u2019re an absolute child and a shitty host", "Oddly enough - you wound up causing stress and youre here now. See the correlation?", "No-one said you weren\u2019t ok with it. They said your guests weren\u2019t ok with it. They\u2019ve just driven 10 hours to your wedding and have to work out what they are doing for dinner. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It\u2019s not the best start to a weekend that\u2019s supposed to be a celebration.", "Hahaha, congratulations for your marriage, but this is not how weddings work if you want your guests to have a nice time. If you didn't want to plan the weekend yourself, you should pay somebody to do it for you.", "They are MAD that they had to make their own plans.\n\nHow are you not getting this with everyone saying the same thing and voting YTA?", "They normally don't invite me to things and I'm not close to them at all. My parents invited most of these people before I sent out the invitations.", "NTA. If your family was planning on going to a restaurant then their plan should have included  reservations.\n\nI'm going to a destination wedding out of country,  and we are planning our own entertainment and meals other than the ceremony.  No one should expect the bride and groom to entertain them.  \n\nCould you have booked a venue for everyone, sure.  So could they.  You didn't book their travel and are not responsible for their meals.  Is it your fault if they didn't plan on breakfast the day of the wedding?  What about meals the day after?\n\nPeople are so entitled these days it's insane.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nNot a wedding but next week my whole family will come visit me to check out my new condo. They will even pick up my grandma on their way here so that we're all together. \nAnd yes, as they don't live here and I planned this, I will have homemade food and snacks ready, entertainment for the weekend (my condo is not that big, they will not be able to look at it for two days, lol) and reservations for dinner. \nBecause that's what you're supposed to do with guests. \nFor a destination wedding you'll have to plan their time there. That's just how it is.", "Based on your comments it Seems like you wanted to be 1ofthosebrides Who is chill and fun and doesn't plan anything. That doesn't work for a wedding especially a destination wedding with family who showed up and felt like you didn't care about them. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Destination weddings are a real pain for anyone going to them. The least you could have done is listed somewhere on the invitation, or in a text, or on a website for your wedding, that there was no formal plan for X & Y days, but listing out some options for the people arriving. Especially letting them know that reservations may be needed. Sure, you might have been chilled out for the entire thing, but your guests were anything but.", "YTA. For having a destination wedding and for planning poorly", "Sorry, but when you host an event in the middle of nowhere, you have an obligation to your guests.  You can't just leave them to their own devices when there aren't many options.", "Maybe I'm out of touch, but I would say you're definitely NTA they're all adults who can Google and make their own plans. You have a wedding to worry about, not where Grandma is eating dinner. I don't get the AH comments you're getting.", "NTA. I'm honestly not understanding what's going on here, etiquette-wise. Every wedding I've ever gone to has been \"ceremony is at x-o'clock, show up early if you're in the bridal party.\" If I were driving for a wedding, I would expect anything I do before or after the wedding to be my own business. Getting there the night before, I'd think \"thank god I can rest up after that drive since the wedding isn't until tomorrow. Let's order some take out to the hotel room.\"\n\nIn-laws family chose to make a reservation at a nearby restaurant for themselves for dinner. Bride's family could've done the same, or ate the pizza, or gone to the restaurant 30 minutes away. It doesn't sound like it was a planned, required, event. Just individual people going \"what should I eat for dinner tonight?\" and not consulting the group because why would they? \n\nI'm especially confused by the people saying you should've given them a list of nearby restaurants so they'd know their options. They have one. It's called typing \"restaurants near me\" into Google maps just like they'd do on any other vacation.", "NTA. People responding are fixated on the wrong thing.", "Destination weddings are the worst. YTA alone for that.", "Yeah a heads up to her own family that the in-laws were making reservations in advance would have been the appropriate thing to do", "It wouldn\u2019t have been hard to call your mom a few days ahead of time and say, \u201c hey! The in-laws let us know they were making reservations for places to eat. Me and my fianc\u00e9 aren\u2019t making any, but y\u2019all might to make some if y\u2019all want to eat out with a large group.\u201d \nNow, that you know they\u2019re upset apologize and say sorry, I didn\u2019t give y\u2019all a heads up. \n\nPS anyone knows that if you plan a destination wedding - you need to let the guest know things like making reservations and activities- that is why so many people have a wedding website that list these things in advance so that way their guest know.", "BUT did you communicate that information to your guests?", "I can not follow this story to save my life.", "I\u2019m glad you enjoyed your wedding, and are extremely carefree and live by the seat of your pants.  Just know that sometimes that\u2019s off putting when you are the de facto host.   Not everyone likes to roll up after an extremely long day of traveling to being handed a piece of pizza in the lobby  and wondering what\u2019s going on", "They made other plans because you didn\u2019t help them, or suggest or coordinate. Then they see you sitting with the other side of the family at the on site restaurant.  Poor execution and optics is what we\u2019re trying to say to you.", "Giving people gifts doesn\u2019t make up for being a massive flake. As a rule, people don\u2019t like to have relationships with people they can\u2019t depend on. You want to be spontaneous? Great. But when it comes to your behavior affecting others, you need to get it together and actually think outside of yourself.", "Oooh, interesting", "Did you give any kind of schedule in the invitations? Anything along the lines of \u2018for those arriving Friday you will be free to make your own plans, these options are available on site for dining, please book ahead etc. otherwise folk are turning up and probably expecting something to be arranged and then not being able to book a table for example. If folk have free time or are to organise themselves for dinner they should be advised of that really. Unfortunately your way just caused confusion."]}
