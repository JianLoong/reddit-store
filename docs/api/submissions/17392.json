Their mom was around, but struggled with mental illness. And their dad was sort of emotionally uninvolved, so I was their main parental figure.

I'm their former step-mom who is thrilled to be part of their lives and would bend over backwards if they needed anything. But I have no claim on them. I'm a glorified older friend. If they didn't feel warm towards me, I'd understand and respect that. \n\nChildren get no say in whether or whom their parents marry. It's beyond their control, so they also have no obligation to form emotional bonds with their parent's partner. However much your dad or his widow or their child may have wished you all could just play happy families, they didn't have the right to demand that in the past and your half-sister doesn't have the right to demand it now. \n\nShe's understandably overwhelmed by the burden of having a sick parent, but she needs to turn to her own support system for that instead of trying to guilt you into taking it on for her.", "Absolutely this, if she was left the house you can bet the house has been left to her only daughter as well so look after your own interests in this.", "TBH, I don't really *blame* the half sister for this.
