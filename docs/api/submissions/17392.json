Their mom was around, but struggled with mental illness. And their dad was sort of emotionally uninvolved, so I was their main parental figure.

If they didn't feel warm towards me, I'd understand and respect that. \n\nChildren get no say in whether or whom their parents marry. It's beyond their control, so they also have no obligation to form emotional bonds with their parent's partner. However much your dad or his widow or their child may have wished you all could just play happy families, they didn't have the right to demand that in the past and your half-sister doesn't have the right to demand it now. \n\nShe's understandably overwhelmed by the burden of having a sick parent, but she needs to turn to her own support system for that instead of trying to guilt you into taking it on for her.", "Absolutely this, if she was left the house you can bet the house has been left to her only daughter as well so look after your own interests in this.", "TBH, I don't really *blame* the half sister for this.

She will leave all her estate to her daughter. It would be a very safe bet to assume you won't be getting anything.\n\nThen why should you spend your money on her? (Obviously it's because they don't want to deplete their assets, but that's not a 'you' problem.) It sounds far too late to build family unity. You won't lose anything but a strained relationship with your half-sister by refusing.", "NTA", "NTA She only contacted you when she wanted money.  that's not family, that's a charity case begging", "NTA. In any way whatsoever. Keep being you!", "NTA. Don\u2019t give these people a penny, you don\u2019t owe them shit.", "Totally NTA. Her mother, not yours so not your responsibility. They seem to all just want to use you for your money. If your half sister is pissed about this she can feel free to go NC with you or you with her (recommended) problem solved", "NTA, you owe them nothing.", "NTA", "Seems like multiple instances - it says they wanted the money when they were struggling at times and then later again for the breast cancer. OP\u2019s dad didn\u2019t lose his house though so clearly they were able to manage.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from but I guess it\u2019s different for her because she grew up without much attachment to them after they tried to force the relationship. I wonder what happened to all the money that her dad got from the marital assets because they could\u2019ve used that to pay for the stepmoms treatment for breast cancer", "Now that is a brilliant question.", "Why do people care about karma?", "If only there was some kind of voting mechanism to signify agreement instead of crapping up threads with repetitious garbage", "Yeah, most kids don\u2019t have dead parents. Although for those who do have dead parents, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to inherit something. My pre-marital assets are also in a trust for my child, along with a college fund held in a trust. If I die, that money is for *her* future, not to help my husband pay his next wife\u2019s bills.", "Some need validation from strangers", "NTA\n\nRepeat after me...\"No is a full sentence.\"\n\nEnough said.", "NTA tell your sister to contact her state department of human services and they can help her organize care options. There\u2019s a department dedicated to helping people get into nursing homes or rehabilitation centers, they help folks apply for social security benefits, you name it they can probably point you in a direction to get it done. \n\nYou are not responsible for her mother\u2019s care. And really neither is she, I think it is dumb that folks don\u2019t think about what they will do when they are too old to live alone and don\u2019t try and set this up themselves, but I\u2019ve also seen a lot of sad situations with elderly people forgotten and essentially rotting away alone in their homes. \n\nIf it is illness and not just age then still, not your concern.", "Well, I don\u2019t care about the house; it has **NOTHING** to do with OP\u2019s question.\nNTA. You\u2019re right about your obligation, or rather *lack* of obligation.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard on your half sister but you don\u2019t owe her anything. Just like you didn\u2019t owe her Mom anything. I\u2019m sorry that they punished you for not wanting her to be your new Mom.", "Nope. But I loved my half sister ( she passed). Id have done anything for her. We shared a father. That\u2019s more than enough for me to be there for her always, in whatever capacity she\u2019d have needed. \n\nIt\u2019s not your obligation, but if you feel anything about her at all, some effort could go a long way in your relationship with her.", "NTA. Sounds like the latest in a history of attempts to use OP as an ATM. Funny, they wanted to replace her mother with her Step-Mother but had no problem using OP's inheritance from that mother.", "NTA.  Your sister is the AH for guilting and insulting you while asking for favours to which she is not, as she seems to think, entitled.\n\nShe wants to help her mother, and that's admirable, but it is her choice and her self-imposed obligation.  Her mother got the marital assets from your Dad, and has a house that can be sold first.", "NTA\n\nand you don\u2019t owe her shit", "> She can sell it if she needs to pay medical bills.\n\nAgreed with everything you said but Christ this is such an awful fucking medical system we have, nobody should go through this. So terrible.", "NTA. They got the house. Indeed, they can sell it.", "Agreed!", "He also could have added his second wife to the deed of the house, which would make it community property. In some states, depending on how long they were married, the house may be community property since it is the house they lived in after marriage. The laws are too varied to make any assumptions.", "You are what everyone thinks you are. A mad toddler with access to the internet. Maybe you should give the keyboard a break. This is the way.", "True. It could be 98% the bank\u2019s too. No way to tell.", "The father got everything not included in what was set aside for OP, including the house OP's mom bought before they were married, so yes, dead mother did provide, and continues to do so for her child. OP didn't owe her father/stepmother that money, it was put away for OP and OP's future, not a rainy day fund for them. That is why it was left in the grandparents control, and not the father's.", "NTA....\nI have step siblings and i would never ask them for anything that has to do with my mom. I will take care of her just like they will take care of their father when the time comes.", "NTA. You are very brave for standing your ground and not being manipulated. This is the money your family wants you to have.", "Attempted theft isn't any better than theft.", "That particular saying is from a TV show on Disney+, *The Mandalorian.*  The leader makes a proclamation, then says, \"This is the way.\" and all the followers repeat \"This is the way.\"  Using it in comments is an inside joke among the fans.", "NTA - you owe them nothing. Tell 'mom' to take a reverse mortgage on the house to pay for her care. If she did not pay for long-term disability, then that is on her. You half-sister can manage the personal care. GL :)", "Um, NTA. The entitlement, the delusion of it all!!! Keep your money. You owe your sister and stepmom nothing.", "nta", "We don't know what country she's in, but in the US, medical costs can be easily half a million or more even with insurance. The fees are so astronomical that it'd be a drop in the bucket. And what if OP needs the money for a house or her own cancer treatment at some point? \n\nWe don't know how much OP has, but if someone left me $100k, that is a large sum of money, but not enough to cover some medical costs. Cancer treatment can easily go over a million dollars.", "You do realize cancer treatment in countries like the US can cost half a million dollars even with insurance, right? Is she supposed to go penniless to treat her? We don't know the exact amount she has."]}
