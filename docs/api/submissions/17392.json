She's probably stressed and overwhelmed and she has no extended family from her mother or our father to be there or help.

It sounds like after your Dad's death the relationships with you were pretty non-existant. Money is the only reason you guys are in contact again, which is generally a bad sign. When your Dad passed, he left you what he wanted for you and he left his wife and step-sister what he wanted for them. That's pretty much the end of the story in my eyes.", "NTA.

You sound like someone who knows how to speak up and defend yourself; I wish I'd had a lot more of that ability myself, over the years.\n\nShe is not your mother; you never had a close relationship, and you've had no relationship for the past decade. I'm guessing you've had no relationship with your half sister, and have never received much (any?) friendship or support from  either of them, am I right?

You made your choice of having no relations with them long ago and should just stick to it, especially when they're just reaching out to you for monetary reasons and not out of actually wanting to get to know you.\n\nthough I'm kind of curious of why you never wanted to have a relationship with them? or was it the other way around?", "NTA in this particular case, but you sound like a cold person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
