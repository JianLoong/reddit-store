I was 14. Emer and I became really amazing friends and she and my brother ended up dating by the time they were 14 and were together until her death just after her 28th birthday. They had two boys together who were 5 and 7 when Emer died.\n\nTwo years after Emer died my brother met his current wife Laura. They dated for two years and got married 18 months ago. The boys are now 11 and 13. The boys aren't really crazy about Laura. They are respectful but she wants a more motherly relationship with them and they're not interested in that with her. My brother was sorta upset about their lack of interest in a closer relationship with Laura and we were talking about it recently and I brought up our own complicated relationship with our dad and his second wife.\n\nThe background there is my brother and I are both adoptees. Our mom was the woman who adopted us at our births with our dad. She died when we were 6 and 8. Our dad pushed for us to call his second wife mom. His wife pushed for the same. The fact we were adopted was used as a reason why we should be able to accept his wife as our mom. Because we weren't biologically related to our mom. Neither of us ever saw her as anything else and dad decided we should have no contact with each other if we didn't accept his wife and her kids as our mom and siblings.\n\nEmer knew how bad things were with our dad and his second wife and she often heard my brother vent about how shitty dad for never understood that him falling in love with someone else enough for them to be his wife didn't mean we would feel the same way about the same woman for her to be our new mom. When Emer knew she was dying she told my brother to remember that if he found someone and their boys didn't want her to be more than his wife. She also wrote him a letter and touched on it there. He had me read the letter to him after Emer passed.\n\nTalking this all through with my brother helped him to realize he was doing what our dad had done. He said he somewhat understood dad a little, in that the hope was there, but he never wanted to do to his boys what dad did to us. He and Laura spoke. Then a couple of days ago my brother and Laura were at my house and she was trying to tell him that Emer would have wanted the boys to have a second mom and it's what all parents want. They would want someone doing that for their kids. My brother told her he knew that wasn't true. She asked if he really believed that and said he might have picked it up wrong. I told her she couldn't speak for Emer. I reminded her that I was present when Emer said it and I read the letter to my brother.  She told me I should be backing her up and if I love Emer so much I would agree that she would want that. My brother told her I knew Emer. She said that didn't mean I had to accuse her so harshly.\n\nShe told me I wasn't helping anyone by interfering.

You can't go up to someone and demand they bond with you. They do that over time. \n\nI think your SIL may need to join some kind of support group, so she can here from *other* step-parents, and maybe from other step-kids.

You have done Emer so proud.", "NTA, but you should approach the subject more delicately. Presumably Emer would want whatever her children want *and* what is best for them, and pushing them into certain feelings is obviously not best. But you don't want to accidentally put up roadblocks.

You can give her space to talk it out.\n\nLaura is borrowing Emer's emotions and trying to speak for her because she does not believe anyone is listening or cares about what Laura feels.\n\nSo to correct that, Laura needs to feel listened to and cared for. She needs to feel that she is enough and that she was chosen to be in this family. \n\nThis is a really tough situation. Try to have some empathy, Laura went into this marriage with one perspective of how it would go and your brother agreed. They shared an outlook and a goal. And then he changed and abandoned her. That's why she's looking for allies.", "While I do think your intention is good \u2026. I don\u2019t think this is a problem you can solve.

These boys can never have too many people in their life that love & care about them. \n\nAt this point no one speaks for Emer. Emer has passed & her family must go on living without her.

Talk to your brother. He can handle his wife.", "NAH.  It's a complicated situation and very difficult for you yourselves to understand.  Luckily everything is set right for you to help. The first thing you need to do is talk to af least one of the kids separately from dad & new mom.  Figure out what the important questions are, feel free to think about what you think is right, and get their feedback. Tell them you just want their opinions and they don't have to do anything you say as a result.  You need to keep building trust with them, and this will do that.  Some important questions might be if they want to call her mom, why and why not. Do they ever want them to be their \"mom\", or do they want to keep that position special for Emer.  Then do whatever they say, with an adult perspective.\n\nYour brother and Laura already recognize they can't answer this by themselves.  There is too much push and pull between everyone to feel confident that any one of them is right.  That's why they came to you, because they need you to arbitrate.  Since you are arbitrating, they should be able to be completely honest with you, and that's what you need to do your job.\n\nYou've talked to them together and you've talked to your brother so you know what they think from that perspective.  I'm not 100% sure you are getting Laura's fully honest opinion, but you do need it.  You should talk to her individually, but ideally, you should talk to her along with someone else she trusts a lot, like her mom or possibly (but not ideally) one of your relatives not related by blood.  You can be honest about why you are doing that, because you want to make sure she feels like she can be open. If it's not necessary, then you don't have to, but I believe it would help.\n\nAfter you do your research, then it's time to start making a decision.  Let them know it's not your decision to make, but you recognize they need neutral advice, and you've done your best to give it.  Be flexible, and you can work out the best solution.  That's all you are capable of, and I'm convinced that if you approach things this way, you will do a good job, and even if it's not perfect, everyone should feel okay with what they all decide together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My dad had married \"The evil step mom from hell\"  and  she came with two daughters. When my sister and I went to live with our dad they had made a lot of promise that my sister and I would like it here side note (My sister and I were in foster care for 5 yrs and were in the process of getting adopted when our father had found us and since we never met him we wanted to try it out biggest mistake of our life.) The first rule was my sister and I had to call her mom and if we didn't we would be pushing.

Changing definitions doesn't change facts.", "Since we want to discuss facts\u2026\n\nOne of the most famous early studies was done by Hungarian psychologist Maria Nagy. She interviewed nearly 400 children living in Budapest just after World War II, a time when death was everywhere. She simply asked them to answer, either in words or pictures, \u201cWhat is death?\u201d\n\nJust one study looked at this topic in the 1950s, followed by eight in the 60s and two dozen in the 70s. Almost all of these studies, according to a fascinating review published in 1984, relied on interviews with children. Some, like Nagy\u2019s, asked open-ended questions, whereas others were more specific, asking things like, Can a dead person come back to life? Can you think of someone who might not die? Will you die?\n\nNo matter what your age, death is not easily defined. But for the purposes of research, scientists define a child\u2019s understanding of death by looking at three specific aspects of the concept.\n\nThe first is death\u2019s irreversibility. Once your body is dead, it cannot ever be alive again. \n\nKIDS UNDER 3 DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND THIS IDEA. THEY\u2019TALK ABOUT DEAD PEOPLE AS IF THEY WENT ON A TRUP OR TOOK A NAP, OR WILL HOLD OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT DEAD THINGS CAN COME BACK TO LIFE WITH THE HELP OF WATER, FOOD MEDICINE, OR MAGIC.\u2019\n\nSo it is indeed my personal opinion that children (not all and also age relevant) that kids do not understand death. And that is also documented and rooted in studies.\n\n[Source](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/when-do-kids-understand-death)\n\n\nKids under 3 don\u2019t understand this idea; they\u2019ll talk about dead people as if they went on a trip or took a nap, or will hold open the possibility that dead things can come back to life with the help of water, food, medicine, or magic. Children begin to grasp death\u2019s finality around age 4. In one typical study, researchers found that 10 percent of 3-year-olds understand irreversibility, compared with 58 percent of 4-year-olds.\n\nThe other two aspects of death are learned a bit later, usually between age 5 and 7. One, dubbed \u2018nonfunctionality\u2019, is the idea that a dead body can no longer do things that a living body can do. Before this is grasped, kids will affirmatively answer questions like, Can a dead person feel? or If someone died, could he still eat? Can he move? Can he dream?\n\n**Based on the above paragraph the science and studies points to the fact that children still do not have a complete understanding of death as proven by the FACT that they affirmatively answer questions such as Can a dead person feel? With a yes. \n\n\nOP states that her nephews were 5 & 7 when their Mother passed away. The study above and as quoted in the second to last paragraph states:\n\n\u2018 The other two aspects of death are learned a bit later, USUALLY between age 5 and 7.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s understand that \u2018usually\u2019 is not a hard and affirmative. All children develop at different rates.\n\nAnd so based on the facts children, especially OP\u2019e Nephews may not have been able to fully understand and that is not just based on the science and studies cited above, this may have been the first loss they suffered. We do not know their Father\u2019s own mental state, how they were supported.\n\nBut you are correct that opinions are not facts. But as cited above those ARE the facts.", "Nice \"source\"\n\nhttps://rosengrenlab.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MenendezHernandezRosengren2020.pdf\n\n> KIDS UNDER 3 DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND THIS IDEA.

Your brother needs to tell her to just knock it off, his children will treat her with respect but not consider her their mother and she needs to accept it because pushing for more will only alienate the boys and possibly even him.\n\nYou are 100% correct in saying that Laura cannot speak for Emer! Emer spoke for herself, both in a conversation with her husband before her death and in the letter she left. Laura keeps insisting that \"this is what all parents want\" and \"this is what Emer would want\" so you should back her up. She needs to understand that this is NOT what Emer wanted and Emer made that very plain before her death. Laura needs to back off before she finds herself without a husband!", "NTA she\u2019s prioritising her wishes (to be called mum) and trying to nudge/force/reshape as she sees fit to get there. She\u2019s saying you interfered because she expected backup and was denied. Sour grapes that it\u2019s not going her way. If her true priority is to be mom then she should know it\u2019s about the kids being loved and cared for and not about what she gets back from the relationship.", "Yeah...I think she's missing the whole point of parenting on her little ego quest.", "Yep. Solo counselling. She's got some very singular issues to iron out before any family counselling. Or she's never going to claw back this lasting first impression.", "Yup, this sub has one of these stories at least weekly. \n\nThe overarching moral of all that of them is to be careful who you marry and make a step parent.", "Agree.", ">I think you might have overstepped a little because it's their marriage and family now. I don't think YTA for backing up your brother, but it's appropriate for them to set a boundary there.\n\n\n\nAt which point was Op not invited into this conversation cos that's the only time she would have \"overstepped\"", "Even with good intentions (but this is very clearly ego driven), Laura has  probably screwed herself over pretty permanently. \n\nIf she'd come in with a sane, empathetic approach and built an actual relationship with the kids organically without all this stupidity, they might have trusted her and had a closer bond. \n\nNow...I don't know if that'll happen. \n\nI'd suggest family therapy for the kids and your brother to overcome his temporary lapse in judgement and really hear the kids out, solo therapy for Laura and then some integration of both together.", "There are many many stories on Reddit that go through this exact scenario. Without fail, every time the \u201cbonus parent\u201d tries to force a relationship, the children involved are repelled\u2026 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard marrying into that situation, but for love of God people, chill out and let the children set the pace. You can\u2019t make someone love you!!!!\n\nOP NTA", "It's up to the kids to decide what they're comfortable with.  I completely understand them not wanting to call her Mom.", "100% this. This is all motivated by her ego, not any love/care for those kids. Most kids I've met can see through that. \n\nI'm glad OPs brother is doing what's right now, but this is going to suck for him.", "Yeah...it's a good idea to really pay attention to who you're marrying and making a step-parent to your kid. There are weekly (at least) versions of this story on this sub - at varying stages of life, and none of them end up well.", "Yep. I lost an aunt and then an uncle as a kid. I fully understood what death meant because my mom was perhaps too transparent about what was happening as my aunt and uncle were passing. Kids are capable of understanding logically and not being terribly disturbed by it if we give them the respect of honesty. It was far less confusing than pretty lies would have been, IMO.", "And where are the toddler aged children in the OP?"]}
