I was 14. Emer and I became really amazing friends and she and my brother ended up dating by the time they were 14 and were together until her death just after her 28th birthday. They had two boys together who were 5 and 7 when Emer died.\n\nTwo years after Emer died my brother met his current wife Laura. They dated for two years and got married 18 months ago. The boys are now 11 and 13. The boys aren't really crazy about Laura. They are respectful but she wants a more motherly relationship with them and they're not interested in that with her. My brother was sorta upset about their lack of interest in a closer relationship with Laura and we were talking about it recently and I brought up our own complicated relationship with our dad and his second wife.\n\nThe background there is my brother and I are both adoptees. Our mom was the woman who adopted us at our births with our dad. She died when we were 6 and 8. Our dad pushed for us to call his second wife mom. His wife pushed for the same. The fact we were adopted was used as a reason why we should be able to accept his wife as our mom. Because we weren't biologically related to our mom. Neither of us ever saw her as anything else and dad decided we should have no contact with each other if we didn't accept his wife and her kids as our mom and siblings.\n\nEmer knew how bad things were with our dad and his second wife and she often heard my brother vent about how shitty dad for never understood that him falling in love with someone else enough for them to be his wife didn't mean we would feel the same way about the same woman for her to be our new mom. When Emer knew she was dying she told my brother to remember that if he found someone and their boys didn't want her to be more than his wife. She also wrote him a letter and touched on it there. He had me read the letter to him after Emer passed.\n\nTalking this all through with my brother helped him to realize he was doing what our dad had done. He said he somewhat understood dad a little, in that the hope was there, but he never wanted to do to his boys what dad did to us. He and Laura spoke. Then a couple of days ago my brother and Laura were at my house and she was trying to tell him that Emer would have wanted the boys to have a second mom and it's what all parents want. They would want someone doing that for their kids. My brother told her he knew that wasn't true. She asked if he really believed that and said he might have picked it up wrong. I told her she couldn't speak for Emer. I reminded her that I was present when Emer said it and I read the letter to my brother.  She told me I should be backing her up and if I love Emer so much I would agree that she would want that. My brother told her I knew Emer. She said that didn't mean I had to accuse her so harshly.\n\nShe told me I wasn't helping anyone by interfering.

You can't go up to someone and demand they bond with you. They do that over time. \n\nI think your SIL may need to join some kind of support group, so she can here from *other* step-parents, and maybe from other step-kids.

You have done Emer so proud.", "NTA, but you should approach the subject more delicately. Presumably Emer would want whatever her children want *and* what is best for them, and pushing them into certain feelings is obviously not best. But you don't want to accidentally put up roadblocks.

You can give her space to talk it out.\n\nLaura is borrowing Emer's emotions and trying to speak for her because she does not believe anyone is listening or cares about what Laura feels.\n\nSo to correct that, Laura needs to feel listened to and cared for. She needs to feel that she is enough and that she was chosen to be in this family. \n\nThis is a really tough situation. Try to have some empathy, Laura went into this marriage with one perspective of how it would go and your brother agreed. They shared an outlook and a goal. And then he changed and abandoned her. That's why she's looking for allies.", "While I do think your intention is good \u2026. I don\u2019t think this is a problem you can solve. Your brother & his wife need professional help (couples/family counseling) to help them determine what dynamic will work best for their family. These boys can never have too many people in their life that love & care about them. \n\nAt this point no one speaks for Emer. Emer has passed & her family must go on living without her.

Talk to your brother. He can handle his wife.", "NAH.  It's a complicated situation and very difficult for you yourselves to understand.  Luckily everything is set right for you to help. The first thing you need to do is talk to af least one of the kids separately from dad & new mom.  Figure out what the important questions are, feel free to think about what you think is right, and get their feedback. Tell them you just want their opinions and they don't have to do anything you say as a result.  You need to keep building trust with them, and this will do that.  Some important questions might be if they want to call her mom, why and why not. Do they ever want them to be their \"mom\", or do they want to keep that position special for Emer.  Then do whatever they say, with an adult perspective.\n\nYour brother and Laura already recognize they can't answer this by themselves.  There is too much push and pull between everyone to feel confident that any one of them is right.  That's why they came to you, because they need you to arbitrate.  Since you are arbitrating, they should be able to be completely honest with you, and that's what you need to do your job.\n\nYou've talked to them together and you've talked to your brother so you know what they think from that perspective.  I'm not 100% sure you are getting Laura's fully honest opinion, but you do need it.  You should talk to her individually, but ideally, you should talk to her along with someone else she trusts a lot, like her mom or possibly (but not ideally) one of your relatives not related by blood.  You can be honest about why you are doing that, because you want to make sure she feels like she can be open. If it's not necessary, then you don't have to, but I believe it would help.\n\nAfter you do your research, then it's time to start making a decision.  Let them know it's not your decision to make, but you recognize they need neutral advice, and you've done your best to give it.  Be flexible, and you can work out the best solution.  That's all you are capable of, and I'm convinced that if you approach things this way, you will do a good job, and even if it's not perfect, everyone should feel okay with what they all decide together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My dad had married \"The evil step mom from hell\"  and  she came with two daughters. When my sister and I went to live with our dad they had made a lot of promise that my sister and I would like it here side note (My sister and I were in foster care for 5 yrs and were in the process of getting adopted when our father had found us and since we never met him we wanted to try it out biggest mistake of our life.) The first rule was my sister and I had to call her mom and if we didn't we would be pushing. We couldn't go and visit our mother or our fathers family because they did not like our step mom side note (she was dating my dad's brother then decided to cheated with my dad while my dad and my mom were together. ) We were only allow to visit her family. We had to babysit her grandson and watch her elderly mother that my sister and I never had a teenage life when we got our first job they told us that one of us had to quit because someone had to watch her grandson and mother it was like this for yrs until I turned 18 and my sister was 17 and we were looking at colleges out of state and his wife told us that we could not go out of state because they don't have the money but they had the money for her youngest daughter. This what broke the camels back and I decided to reach out to our mother and ask if we could live with her because we could not take anymore when told our dad we knew he was heart broken while his wife had the biggest grin on her face asking us when we are leaving. 2 Yrs later our dad divorced the \"evil step mom from hell\" and worked on rebuild our relationship. He got to see my boys grow up and be in the life of his two great grand children he passed away in 2020 and I am so happy that we were able rebuild our relationship before it was too late.\n\nOP this is the life that your nephews will live if your brother does not nip this in the bud and make boundaries for his sons.", "Sorry. YTA If she had specifically asked for your input it\u2019d be one thing but because you have your own feelings and grief (including your own baggage about your past situation) you inserted yourself. I have made this mistake myself in the past but I firmly believe people should stay out of the middle of a problem between a couple. With a couple of exceptions, obviously. That being said, I hope she doesn\u2019t continue to pressure the kids and let\u2019s the relationship grow at its own pace.", "NTA; trying to force the kids will never work. They need to respect that it\u2019s their choice", "NTA Establishing and building a good parent/child relationship is much more about what you do, not what you say.", "I think it's even less about them calling her mom specifically. Laura is bothered by the fact they are polite to her but don't need her for anything or ask her for something when they could. They go to my brother mostly or sometimes me or their other family (they have grandparents and uncles from Emer's side). She feels like they are not giving her the chance to be much of anything to them. Which is possibly very true. But they might never want that.", "Not to mention Laura's attempts at gaslighting OP's brother despite knowing of the existence of Emer's letter and her *written* wishes that OP's brother respect his kids' choice to not see Laura as their mother.", "You earn it", "A lot of people fail to realize that things don't always slot together into a neat little puzzle. They can, and it happens, but not always. Sometimes you just have to make the best out of the pieces you have. When a piece, or multiple pieces are missing, the puzzle changes. That's how I see it. The boys might never want new pieces to come in where their mom was. Maybe with time they will feel more strongly about Laura being something more to them but maybe she's always going to be my brother's wife in their eyes. It really doesn't help anyone to push it.\n\nMy brother and I are living proof of that.", "You are a truly awesome step-dad.  My kids have an extra set of grandparents (long story).  Technically, the grandma is a step-grandmother.  But after a decade of being loving and really connecting with our kids in a genuine and not-pushy way, she is WAY closer to them than one of their bio-grandmas.  They 100% see her as their grandmother not a step.  She gave them so much grace and space - I love her so much.", "She's not being someone they'd want to go to.", "Kids aren't stupid. You said your brother had started trying to force it upon them. Now they are under the impression that going to her will have strings attached, and let's face it even if your brother stopped pushing Laura hasn't the vibe hasn't changed. I have no idea how to fix that, but trust isn't something that can be built overnight.", "So, with this insight... I'm confused with what she's expecting. Does she want your brother to start diverting the kids to her if they ever have some little request another adult can take care of and they're more comfortable asking? So, she's just ignoring the fact that *they're more comfortable asking someone else* and doesn't realize that she needs to make them more comfortable coming to her if she wants that to happen organically? Or she does realize, and she just wants to inconvenience everyone else while simultaneously making the kids more uncomfortable coming to her, just to stroke her own ego? I'm leaning toward the latter here. She needs to realize that SHE will ALWAYS have way more work to do cultivating this relationship than those kids, and your bro needs to realize that her trying to dump that responsibility on his kids WILL be damaging for them.\n\nSincerely, \n\nA Wicked Step Daughter", "They are so lucky they have you in their lives. Please be there for them because it sounds like it may get a little more frustrating.", "She is kind of trying to gaslight everybody, well, she is just lying to herself, being a good adult, caring and living without entitlement might get her closer to the kids, but it shouldn\u2019t be her goal, you don\u2019t buy love, you don\u2019t request respect, you build up a relationship NTA. If she is respectful of their mother though, they won\u2019t turn their back at her.", ">  Laura is bothered by the fact they are polite to her but don't need her for anything or ask her for something when they could.\n\nI can kinda see the point here, but I think its what she's claiming to deflect the accusations of forcing the mom title/relationship.\n\nIdeally, a step parent should be someone the kids trust and rely on. They should also both respect the place each other occupy in the bio parent's life and never intentionally be a burden on them. Anything more is just icing on the cake. The kids aren't relying on her and while they might be polite, I can believe they are still being rather cold.\n\nLaura isn't saying their late mom would want them to be warmer to her though, she straight out said second mom despite that being obviously untrue. She's obviously desperate for that title and place in her step-kids' life and at least from your telling of the story, is not interested in a steady but slow building of a warmer relationship with the kids. She wants to force it now.\n\nFor their sake, and maybe your brother's as well, I hope you can make him realize he can't falter on this. He risks not only the complete destruction of the relationship between his wife and kids forcing him to be confronted several times having to choose between them but he risks his own relationship with them as well. Its fine to encourage a warmer relationship where they can rely on his wife, but it can't be forced or sped through and its ok if they never become incredibly close. Just comfortable enough where the love he has for each of them never has to make him choose between them.", "Why would they go to someone who doesn't accept or respect them? They're not props, they're people. She has to earn their trust and accept that they get to decide if she is someone they want to depend on. And pushing them to allow her to replace their mother is not how that's going to happen. She is shooting herself in the foot.", "It's disappointing you even had to point out to your brother he was doing to his kids what your Dad did to you. And remind him of his late wife's fears.", "She can be someone important to them if she takes the time to earn it, but she has to accept that they don't want a new mother. They want their first one back. That's unlikely to change, especially if she keeps acting like she wants to erase everything Emer said and get place in their lives.", "New wife should just mom them without a label at every opportunity and show them love and support. Dad should do the messier parenting with new wife as kind support for Dad and kids. \n\nThere are a ton of things you can do to support a kid that aren\u2019t related to Mother\u2019s Day gifts or calling someone mom. Those are superficial. \n\nIf new wife wants to be a mom, then she will accept that \u201cher\u201d kids are their own people with their own brains and will be giant assholes to her sometimes. That\u2019s actual motherhood. But you do it anyway. That\u2019s also actual motherhood.", "There was a great AITA where the new wife talked with the stepkid who was adamant that she could never be his mom. She said \"what about being your friend?\" And they developed a decent relationship.", "The harsh reality is that the death of a parent is hard at any age but the death of a parent when you are a kid is absolutely \ud83c\udf0f shattering.\n\nKids cannot fully comprehend death and do not yet have the coping mechanisms that adults have. Couple that with the fact that they probably resent the fact that their dad moved on and that his new wife is trying to force them to treat her like their new \u2018Mom\u2019 is a recipe for disaster. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe fact that the new wife is trying to manipulate and gaslight the children\u2019s father is disgusting. The new wife is the one craving At acceptance and the only one it is hurting is the kids and the real relationship that will be damaged is the one between the kids and their father. They will resent their father in the same way OP and her brother did their Dad.\n\nFull stop. This needs to end now before it is too late.\n\nOP: NTA. If your brother is not in therapy with his kids encourage him to do so. The kids and their Dad only to work through their feelings. Good luck.", "You know, the phrase that step parent should be someone the kids trust and rely on hit it to the point.\n\nLaura is not going patient path and proving that she can be trusted. She is actually showing that she can't be trusted to take kids' wishes and best interests into account. She is showing that her wishes are more important than others'. Why kids should go to someone like this?", "It is a little disappointing, but the good news is that he was receptive to the criticism, and he pushed back on his new wife's insistence about this.", "Ya she\u2019s a control freak and all it\u2019s going to do is make his kids dislike him more. She\u2019s going to be a big problem for years to come. Good Luck.", "> Kids cannot fully comprehend death\n\nThis is simply not true. Children can, and many around the world do, comprehend death. Many cope even better than the average adult in western countries. Children here are protected from death, we tell them \"little white lies\" about how fluffy went to a farm to run with other dogs or how Goldie went to the ocean to swim with his friends. We don't take them to see grandpa when he is dying, and we tell them that grandma is sleeping when we go to her funeral. \n\nWe fi this because we don't think a child can understand death, but what we are doing is not giving them the experience while in a safe environment. Instead we expect them to \"figure out\" cooking strategies when they are 45 and need to grieve while planning our funeral.\n\nWe routinely underestimate children's resilience and intelligence.", "> She is actually showing that she can't be trusted to take kids' wishes and best interests into account.\n\n100%. You basically summed up a lot of what I said with that alone. I will be saying this now from now on to not be so wordy. lol."]}
