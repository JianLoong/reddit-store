You pay the bills girl. Don't let that ragaddy man confuse you.", "NTA. He IS a guest. Why did you bother trying to call or text him. He\u2019s not worth your time. This man showed you who is and that is an inconsiderate rude entitled person.", "NTA, he might have been helping with buying food, but the bed is yours, not his and he has no say on how you use it.  Your house, your rules.\n\nHe should have gone to his place to sleep instead of trying to come to yours.", "Noooooo! This mofo has no sympathy for a pregnant women sleeping in a bed. NTA. I would really reflect on your relationship with this guy.", "NTA - Your sister, and her unborn child, are your blood relations. Your boyfriend is a date that's worked out well, so far. Remind him of this.\n\nThe pregnant sister wins, what a shock.", "NTA. He's your boyfriend, not fianc\u00e9 or husband. Technically, he *is* a guest.", "NTA", "NTA. Please don\u2019t ever change.", "NTA.. he can\u2019t just come demand what he wants and think he\u2019s gonna get what he wants when he wants the immature and for him to walk out oh yeah you dodged a billet", "NTA but if your sister is always there, you might find it hard to have a good relationship. Your boyfriend is very entitled, it's not his home.\n\nWith that being said, in my world both of them could go home and sleep in their own respective beds. They're not children.", "Hard for me to make a judgement, because I would personally never let anyone other than my gf and I sleep in our bed. I guess if you have no problems with that, NTA. At the same time though, she's pregnant, she's not your grandma who you'd possibly let sleep in your bed since she's older.", "Even paying for food in a restaurant gives you no say in how they run their business. What nerve. Your boyfriend is unreasonably demanding and, actually, controlling. The lack of communication afterwards and ignoring your calls is absolutely them trying to blackmail you emotionally and to alter your perception of events to be more sympathetic and submissive to theirs. Watch out. Reasonable couples can talk things through and respect each others' possession, rules and boundaries. Behaviour like that escalates.\n\nYou're NTA. Also, your sis is very lucky to have such a considerate sibling. I hope everything goes well over the next four months and that there is joy come September-October!", "Why is your BF coming home from work at 4/6 and going to sleep\u2026 what time does he work?", "NTA.... age gap is significant at that age, it's hard for older males with a decent age gap to truly respect their younger partners... so in his mind his say was more important than yours here... even though it is YOUR house.\n\nImagine being so entitled that you magically think a pregnant person shouldn't be allowed the comfort of a bed because omg The KING needs his bed!\n\nWhat he has shown you is a red flag.  Not only was what he wanted kind of selfish... He's shown you the typical age gap dynamic where if you displease him he's going to ignore you and most likely try to make you feel so bad that you come crawling back and start developing an aversion towards displeasing him... which would help him control you a bit better over time.  I doubt you're going to fall for it, since you already seem ok at standing your ground.", "He help pay for food? Cool, he can sleep on the kitchen floor.", "NTA buying some of the household food is barely a drip in the bucket. when he starts paying half of all of the bills then he can say something.", "NTA stop calling and let the big baby go.", "NTA but this is just a preview of how he views pregnant women's needs as below his own. How do you think he'll treat you if you became pregnant? I wouldn't give him the chance. Dump him ASAP. You're a strong and independent woman and you deserve better. Good for you for standing up to him.", "NTA. Boyfriends come and go. Sisters are for life. Looks like this BF needed to go and you've had a lucky escape.", "NTA - He doesn't pay half of the rent. bills, utilities, upkeep for the house. He only helps a little towards food. He has ZERO ownership or decision-making about your home. Zero. None. Bupkiss. Zilch.\n\nThe fact that he tried to claim he did (HAHA) and even to the point of wanting to remove a pregnant woman from her sleeping space and refusing an air mattress... WOW, he is really a special kind of yucky.\n\nSo basically he was using you and your space to make HIMSELF feel like he had ownership of your home, he doesn't have the respect nor the class to help a pregnant woman, and he ghosted you because he didn't like hearing the truth.\n\nHoney stop calling and chasing after him - *he* owes *you* the apology, not vice versa, and frankly you can do better than this dude.", "NTA. Your BF is the ass.  You\u2019re starting to see his true colors", "Everyone is the asshole here", "nta but why are you even texting him and his friends? let the asshole go, you dodged a bullet there .", "Nope,  you're not.", "NTA. He literally thinks paying a contribution towards food lets him overrule you. You were right to show him that's not the case, but you're undoing all that good work by chasing him now.", "NTA. Break up with that dude, he's selfish AF.", "If he has some right in there, then it would be, at best, the same as yours. Your sister is PREGNANT, was as tired as him AND arrived sooner. NTA, he is", "NTA. If he doesn't pay for anything but \"some food\", he gets no say. If he wants to sleep in a \"real bed\", tell him to take his ass to his own house.", "NTA. And even if the house was yours _and_ his then you\u2019d still be NTA.\n\nYou should be the one doing the swerving, not him. Unless he apologises and shows understanding of what a monumental bell end he\u2019s been, do not let him back in your life. You\u2019ll have dodged a bullet. \n\nThis is indicative of what his attitude towards you would be if you were to be pregnant or otherwise in greater need than him. He wouldn\u2019t care. He\u2019d put himself first.", "NTA - your bf was, entitled to your home, no empathy for your wishes or sleeping pregnant sister.\n\nI imagine he was tired and cranky, doubled down on his bs to get what he wanted", "NTA. \n\nActually, he _is_ a guest. He doesn't live there nor does he contribute to the bills. He is very much a guest. \n\nThat being said, it's not his bed. It's yours. You get to decide who sleeps in it, not him. \n\nHe's a guest, not a tenant. He has no say. \n\nNTA.", "I mean, he has his own place to sleep anyway. Its not even like your house is the ONLY place he has, so I don\u2019t understand why its such a big deal for him. Just\u2026 he can go to the other place that he actually pays for?? And then visit with you once he is rested. \n\nSomebody so inflexible is not someone i would like to spend my time with tbh. You are NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Frankly he\u2019d be quite TA even if you actually lived together\u2026 But since you don\u2019t and it\u2019s not his place it\u2019s even more insane.", "NTA he has his own place he can sleep at also if he stays at yours a lot he should help with food it\u2019s not your job to feed him. You\u2019re a good sister!", "Tell him when he\u2019s pregnant he can sleep in the bed. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "maybe he thinks that was a guy and not your sister?", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t live there. You do. If he wants to take a nap after work he has his own place and his own bed to do so.", "He didn\u2019t come over in the middle of the day to nap, he wanted to use the bed with you. Your sisters presence put a hole in his plans, that\u2019s why he is upset. Your house, your rules. NTA. This guy is an inconsiderate, selfish, and entitled jerk. You can do way better", "NTA and your boyfriend is a controlling dick, it's your house, he's not even paying rent. Also even if y'all were married and that was straight up a house you owned together.... literally who would get mad at someone for not making their pregnant sister take a nap on the couch like wtf", "I think this argument would have come up sooner or later abut something because it sounds like your BF views your house as part his too. So better to establish the rules", "NTA\u2026 He\u2019s TA. If he can\u2019t care for your pregnant sister, he\u2019s not the one for you.", "NTA but he is. He\u2019s trying to control who you can have in your home and what your guest is allowed to do. Now he\u2019s ignoring your attempts to reach out. You have nothing to apologize for. He sounds like a real piece of work though. I wouldn\u2019t take him back if he returns, if I were you.", "NTA. It is your house. Your furniture, your room, you pay the heat, the a/c, the water. He helps pay for food.  Not even all of it. He has no say.", "NTA. Please rethink your choices and whether or not you're willing to stay with him. You can talk about it again and explain your side once he's well rested but if he still doesn't apologize and make up for what happened then I'd advise you to break up with him. Living with someone like that is gonna be a pain in the ass. Take it from me. I live with someone like that. Sadly, I can't ask him to leave cause he's my uncle/my mom's little brother.", "NTA\n\nYeah, I pay for the food I eat too. It's funny how that works out.", "Yep. Agree", "Can you imagine how bossy he\u00b4d be if he paid for more?? He's be so controlling and unreasonable.", "Also he can't sleep in the bed one time and now he pouts and ices you out?? Real mature.", "He has his whole own home to go to, that has a whole big EMPTY bed in his bedroom. That's where he should have gone for a nap after an early finish. Not to bludge at the girlfriends house.", "Considering he\u2019s 25 years old, your use of \u2018doubtful\u2019 is very kind!", "This!!!!", ">It's so weird that he came to your house to nap in the first place.\n\nThis has cracked me. He finished work early and thought he was going to nap the afternoon away in someone else's bed/house. Not even a thought to spend the bonus time taking op out, like a boyfriend. Not even a thought to the fact there's a whole empty house that he has keys to, where he could nap undisturbed.", "WHAT? IT'S HER SISTER NOT A GUEST. You sound awful", "My sister had miscarriages before so she stays with me. \n\nMy BIL leaves her at mine\u2019s before going to work because as it\u2019s closer to where he works, if anything  happens he can be there quicker", "She\u2019s mostly there on Mondays and Tuesday and it\u2019s often during afternoons so my boyfriend always working then\n\nI don\u2019t know why but that day he finished earlier", "Well, it\u2019s more my bed but yeah, I guess I can get why that could make him uncomfortable.\n\nBut also, I wash everything and put on brand new sheets and all after she leaves", "He pays for food he eats at her place, nothing more. Now if sister had eaten all the food he paid for, ok, frustration warranted. To expect he has a say regarding who sleeps in her bed bc he buys food he then eats? Nope. He\u2019s way overstepping.", "He usually works from 8am to 6pm. \nHe has a break in between but stays at work\n\nHe don\u2019t go to sleep when he comes back at 6pm but since he came back at 4pm this time,  I guess he wanted to take a nap", "I don\u2019t think so because he knows that my sister spend her afternoons at mine\u2019s", "you need a new bed", "This easy for me to say not being in ypur shoes but i really think you shouldnt let come back of he tries. Dude was dick then ghosted you, theres no way he wont pull more shit", "INFO\n\nWhy didn't he just go home and nap then? He has his own place and he probably knows your sister spends her days at your place because of her pregnancy and miscarriages....\n\nI'm lost as to why he doesn't understand that?", "Not to be obtuse, but why is he \u201cobviously\u201d not the biggest fan of your guy friends? Kinda feels like saying yes he is possessive/jealous but you just don\u2019t want to say it? \n\nMy partner likes all my male friends the same as my female friends\u2026 to be honest, it would never occur to me that he would feel any differently about my male friends vs my female friends because they\u2019re all people I care deeply about, and if someone is important and valued to me then they\u2019re important to him too by default. \n\nSo I guess I don\u2019t see why \u201cobviously\u201d not liking all your make friends equals \u201cnot necessarily the jealous type\u201d. Like it\u2019s fine if that\u2019s the kind of person he is, and if you\u2019re fine with that, but we should always be realistic and aware of what our partners\u2019 behaviours represent", "Best wishes for your sister and family. You're a good sister and he's not a good, compassionate person.", "So you're spending sister time before the baby. That's sweet.\n\nYes, your BF is entitled and is a jerk. He might have done you a favor by ignoring your calls. It might be time to move on.", "I disagree.", "He sounds like a child, came home, \u201cI want sleep\u201d you told him no for a reasonable justification. \u201cHe has thrown his toys out the pram. Drop him like a lead weight off a damn.", "Plus he doesn\u2019t even live there full time. To get a nap, he can just go home right?", "Yeah maybe", "Yeah, major control/entitlement vibes there.", "I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s used to coming over at mine\u2019s after work I guess", "Well I mean, he never said anything to me about my guy friends.\n\nI don\u2019t think I used the right words, but like, he won\u2019t go out of his way to go get a beer with them, he have conversations with them when they initiates it but won\u2019t necessarily engage a conversation by himself. He still respectful towards them so that\u2019s why I don\u2019t see him as jealous.", "Are you the boyfriend? \ud83d\ude02 I'm going to yskr it as you ARE. Listen he doesn't pay for the expenditures, he pays for SOME food. He has no right to tell OP what to do in her flat that she pays for by herself. He has rights over the fridges food and that's it. The entitlement is ridiculous on your part and his unless you're both the same person that is.", "I\u2019m happy he did though, OP deserves so much better!"]}
