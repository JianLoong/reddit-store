Talk again when he pays the rent/mortgage/other utilities. It's your house, you have an entire say on what's going on there.\n\nAnyway. It's insensitive, heartless, and rude move of him to ask you to prioritize him over your pregnant sister. One, it's your sister, two, you've provided a solution: that he could use the inflatable bed (which he proudly didn't want to use because he's not a guest while- HELLO. he's THE guest in your home?) and three, she's pregnant for God's sake. Even in public transportation pregnant woman always has a priority seat over people who has just come back from work.\n\nImagine it's you being pregnant and your sister's husband drives you away from the bed or tells you that he's also tired from the work and wants to use the bed. Ew.\n\nI'd suggest you to not give in to him and just let him be for a while.

I can't stress this enough.", "Girl, this is a huge red flag! He is also a guest in your house and doesn't get to decided who sleeps where. Of course he pays for the food he eats, that does NOT give him any say in your house. It's not his decision to make.

He is entitled to the food, again, nothing else. \n\nIf you decide to keep him around, and I don't recommend it, you need to have a serious discussion on boundaries. He doesn't think you have any boundaries at all. He sees you as his doormat.\n\nIt is your home. You can have who you want, where you want. This is your sanctuary. Don't let him turn it into a war zone.", "NTA. If you were married and owned everything equally but decided to extend hospitality to a pregnant woman for one afternoon, he would be an asshole for being mad.", "NTA- I\u2019m sure he helps pay for food that he also eats. He doesn\u2019t pay rent and he doesn\u2019t live there. Fussing about your sister is just rude. He\u2019s acting entitled to your space. It\u2019s very sweet your sister has you to rely on.

Gather his shit, package it up, send a final text, email, and telephone call stating that the left behind things of his are available to be shipped when he provides the address to you.

Is he for real? Your sister is pregnant and deserves a proper place to sleep. What did he expect you to give her the inflatable mattress while he slept all cushy in a bed he has no right over?
