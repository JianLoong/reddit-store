You will no longer be able if no one can be bothered to inform you when the meeting is arranged.

You\u2019re the team lead that comes with certain expectations. I work in tech as well so I get it", "NTA\n\nNo one should be staying past their end time for impromptu meeting. They were never talked about. This was a bad trend that should\u2019ve never been started. This is inappropriate and unprofessional behavior.\n\nBut I feel like I had to say this: if you don\u2019t actually know the ins and outs of this single father\u2019s life, don\u2019t say picking up your child is an excuse. Having responsibilities to pick up your child on time, is a fact of life for parents. I worked for daycare for over 10 years of my life. I cut off time was 6 PM. If you do not pick up your child at 6 PM, you\u2019re gonna be charged extra bucks. Do you know how pissed I would normally be when parents don\u2019t pick up their child on time. And you don\u2019t know me, but in comparison to my coworker, who had to stay with me, I was the gentler of the pissed off people. Everything else about the coworker is a huge problem, but ultimately that should not interfere with him, picking up his child on time. There are other ways to \u201cdiscipline\u201d/\u201cpunish\u201d him that do not involve him not meeting his parental responsibilities to his child as a single parent.\n\nTranslation of this post is, your workplace is toxic. Your workplace has no consideration for that workers. Your workplace is not friendly towards parents, or people who want to have a life outside of work. Ultimately your workplace is the problem. Not the single father, who could not pick up his child on time.", "NTA but the real AH here is your boss/company who feels is acceptable to require you to stay until 8 PM on little to no notice. If you are always the one doing it, I think it\u2019s fair to say no once in a while and let someone else pick up the slack.", "NTA - your company is the AH. Your coworker could have done the same as you and said no.", "NTA, and I suggest making all the techs an \u2018on-call\u2019 schedule. Week 1; Tech 1 is on call. Week 2; Tech 2 is on call. Etc. Whoever is on call will take the after-hours meetings that week.\n\nThat way, there\u2019s no canceling plans, scrambling to find someone to pick up your kid, having your week disrupted because so-and-so is on vacation and now you have to cover for them. Everyone will be able to make their arrangements in advance, and it\u2019s fair to everyone on the team.", "NTA.  The CIO could have stayed if it was that important....", "Lets see how \"flexible\" OPs job is when he rolls in at 11am after the next 6-8 meeting...", "so the CIO made him stay. nothing to do with you.", "I did not directly tell him to work it. I just said no and the cio told the other coworker to", "It's not op's decision to force the other tech to have to work. That is literally the boss/employers decision. \n\n\"Enabling\" an employer? That's a weak argument. Just as weak as them trying to guilt op.", "Tbh that up for debate considering it was just a meeting thats not insanely crucial. If this was like the entire system or server went offline then yeah id be ordering dinner at work and staying after.", "By knowing if I declined the CIO would force someone to stay and that just so happens to be my coworker. I knew he would make him stay but my coworker could of easily just said no and walked out. Im not sure of the consequences if that was the case though.", "Im not a manger. Im a team lead or senior tech. The cio is the department manager.", "Tbh he doesn\u2019t do much and I\u2019m just being honest its unfair treatment. Considering we get nearly the same pay and yet more is expected so me with little to no effort from the company to show gratitude towards good work ethics or standards met. But thats a different topic.", "I would edit that in. Your wording makes it sound the opposite. NTA. Good, solid boundaries.", "That's a different story then. The way you said you \"made\" him had me thinking you delegated the task. He should say no too. All of you should until your employers get their shit together.", "Edit your post. Your wording makes it sound like you forced him to stay in your place.", "Thanks for not reading the edit to NTA after being informed that OP didn't delegate the task, but simply said no themselves and the boss passed the task on to the next person.\n\nBut for the record, not saying no to unreasonable demands and allowing employers to continue to abuse employees with their bad policies is enabling. \u270c\ufe0f", "I don't think you understand what I was asking. Mandatory overtime, is where your boss tells you you **have** to stay over.  Such as \"I need you to stay an extra hour.\" Optional overtime is where an employer gives you the choice. Such as \"We have this project coming up, if you want to do extra work, it's authorized.\"\n\nDepending on where you work, (nation, state), failure to work mandatory overtime can be held against you.  Best case, it goes on your work record that you're unreliable. Worst case, in some situations, it can prompt a write-up."]}
