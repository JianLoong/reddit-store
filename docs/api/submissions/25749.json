It sounds to me like you embellished the situation in order to get CPS involvement. Had you called CPS and said \"I don't like the way my SIL chose a babysitter\" it would have been screened out because that is none of your business. \n\nInstead of calling CPS, why didn't you call your brother and offer to babysit for the weekend?", "YTA. Leaving kids with a babysitter is not child neglect. You had NO PROOF of anything an caused trouble for everyone... and while CPS was investigating this none sense, kids with real issues where put on the back burner. Congrats.\n\nStop wasting CPS's time.", "YTA and probably going to receive a doorknock from the police if you keep making nuisance phone calls. Just because it's anonymous doesn't mean they don't have the capacity to trace you.\n\nYou sound jealous, paranoid, and dangerous to be around.\n\nYou also have no way at all of knowing how Amy vetted the babysitter. Or, for that matter, your brother's role in this decision. But hey, I'm sure he will quickly work out that you attempted to get his family into trouble and will cut contact with you as you deserve.", "Yes yta why didn\u2019t you talk to your brother about your concerns with the babysitter first?", "YTA - there are services out there that do vetting. Did you offer to babysit? You are not the parent, therefore your opinions (unfortunately for you) on who gets to babysit do not matter. \n\nThis would be a line in the sand, personally. You have endangered their family stability, if I were looking from their POV, and would be forced to cut you out.", "You called CPS because your SIL hired a babysitter? How does that make sense? YTA", "I doubt this is real, and I strongly suspect you\u2019re actually the same person behind a different bait post from a few hours ago. \n\nJust in case though, YTA. Wasting CPS resources won\u2019t make you prettier than your SIL.", "YTA that is not what CPS is for. Also, you really have to consider that your brother was ok with this decision and he is just as responsible as Amy but you don\u2019t seem to be concerned with his character.", "Holy fucking shit. YTA. An unvetted babysitter is not child neglect. If she is neglectful, then you can call CPS. But not just because you think she \u2018might not be okay\u2019", "I understand that you were worried about your nieces, but, YTA.  Your SIL might be flighty but has she EVER demonstrated any kind of neglect or endangerment to those girls?  Calling CPS was way over the line. You could have checked in on them before sounding the alarms and causing panic and fear among everyone. \nI expect you just ended your relationship with your brother, SIL and your nieces.", "You don't respect her, you started off the conversation by calling her names.\n\nThen you call CPS because they hired a babysitter. \n\nPersonally I think this is a shit post, but I also know plenty of adults dumb enough to pull such a stupid stunt.\n\nYou would never be allowed near my family again. If I could, I'd get a restraining order. \n\nThe worst part about this is your justification is bullshit but CPS has to take all complaints seriously.\n\nYou wasted everyone's time, cost people money and attempted to ruin a family. You're an animal and YTA.", "YTA \n\nIf you were so concerned you should have offered to babysit. Also isn\u2019t your brother part of this? So you called CPS on him too..\nSounds like your jealous of SIL more than anything", "They both left the kids with the sitter, why are you acting like SHE is to blame?\n\nAnd of course YTA\n\nWho the hell calls CPS on someone because they don't agree with whom they left the kids. You had absolutely no reason to believe the kids were in any danger. And you actually Lied as they did not abandon their kids, they left them with a sitter. Someone that agreed to take them and they were fully aware where the kids are.\n\nIf I were them I'd go fully NC with you.\n\nAnd now you act like you weren't aware of the consequences. WTF do you think would happen if you report someone for endangering and abandoning their kids? WTF???", "YTA you wasted the system's time and have probably ruined any relationship you had with your brother. She didn't pick some stranger off the street, she used a service that pre-vets their workers. You really just don't like your SIL and it's horrible of you to use things like CPS for your pettiness.", "YTA.  I hope your brother's family cuts you off.  You could have, you should have, handled your concerns differently (as in talking directly to your brother and his wife).", "YTA and a big one. If leaving your children with a sitter for a weekend is grounds for calling CPS I guess all parents can kiss goodbye their little one\u2026 \nYou have no idea how she hired the sitter, unless you were there 24/7 buzzing around her, cause if someone ask me about how I hired mine I sure would not stop describing every single interview, question I ll just go \u2018I found her on care.com\u2019 and 99% of parents. You just hate her and for this you stirred unnecessary shit. And a big shit you unload on them.", "YTA. While you may have thought you had good intentions you didn't even try to speak to your brother or family before going defcon 1. Also, how do you know exactly how she found the sitter? You literally could have ruined their lives because you're a a nosey nobody. Don't be surprised if you're out of their lives for good.", "YTA, nothing even happened for you to call CPS. You don\u2019t know the extent of the vetting process. You should\u2019ve minded your business unless your nieces were in harm\u2019s way.", "Oh poor you you didn\u2019t think through calling child protective services on your brothers family. You\u2019re either stupid, naive, or vindictive hard to parse out which. Your concern about the potential babysitter is stupid when your actions could have had the kids placed into some randoms temporary custody where who knows what could have happened. \n\n\nYour a heinous AH and I would expect your family to be all set with having you around in the future", "YTA - they hired a babysitter. If you were concerned about it, you could have at least go check them up.", "YTA - you seem like you are on a witch hunt again your SIL.  Calling CPS was not a reasonable response to this situation.  You seem jealous, over-involved, and paranoid.", "YTA.  This is a completely unnecessary escalation.  If you're that jealous of Amy, just go low contact with her.  Actually, never mind, she'll probably never speak with you again and I doubt you'll ever see your nieces again either.  Congrats?", "YTA. You're extremely judgemental. You're extremely cruel. And you're extremely idiotic if you thought nothing bad would come out of calling CPS. You had no real reason to think these kids were in danger and you accused your sister in law of child endangerment. Wtf?", "YTA. What you did might be unforgivable. CPS will have your brother and sister-in-laws name on file. Their kids gave been interviewed and may be traumatized. I am sure your brother and his wife are traumatized. Easy for your boyfriend to stand by you as it's not HIS family that was torpedoed by your \"vain and ditzy\" behavior. Vain thinking you are superior in parenting someone elses kids and ditzy in calling cps when you could have just dropped by to check in over the weekend. I bet I know whose favorite aunt you will never be. YTA. Oh and your boyfriend is also TA.", "Yeah, YTA. There are websites specifically for hiring qualified, pre-screened people who have references and background checks. Plus, how would you know if she vetted them or not? \n\nThe fact that you would put your own family and those poor girls through that trauma for no reason is horrible.  You didn't even talk to them before calling. \n\nOne thing is clear, though - it's easy to see why YOU weren't asked to watch them.", "YTA, Omgggg child neglect and endangerment!?!? You made it seem like they left the kids in the house completely by themselves with no food and no water. THEY HAD A BABYSITTER!!!! Just cause you weren\u2019t comfortable with it doesn\u2019t mean anything cause if that\u2019s the case you could\u2019ve talked to your brother before escalating to CPS. Get therapy, and fast cause you\u2019re gonna need it", "First, I just LOVE how Amy was the evil one for failing (in your opinion) to vet the babysitter appropriately. But your brother is, I guess, blameless? Because he's not also a parent? Tell me what I'm missing. \n\nSecond, did Amy go though an agency? An agency that, you know, does the vetting for you? \n\nEither way, YTA. Absolutely. You did a terrible thing.", "INFO\n\nHow do you even know the extent to which they interacted with or vetted this babysitter?", "Holy shit YTA. Do you have any idea how traumatizing it is for kids to be taken from their parents, even for a short time? The right thing to do would have been to voice your concerns to your brother, then butt out. Their mom being a \u201cditz\u201d is no reason to sick CPS on a family. You could have caused serious harm. If it were me I would never trust you around my family again.", "YTA \nThere are kids who get taken for nothing and it\u2019s impossible not to consider that fact when making a call like that. You called CPS for something that people on this subreddit complain about their family not doing on vacations and weddings. So yeah YTA and a big one.", "YTA, if you care watch the kids for them or recommend someone.", "Jesus, yes, I would never, ever, ever speak to you again if I were your SIL.  YTA.  WTF were you thinking?", "YTA and what you did was probably illegal since the story you told here would not warant a police responce, so you probably \"exagerated\" your story when making your call. The only one endangering your nieces is you. You think having you parents being questioned by the police is good for a kids? Or the rumours and bullying that go with it?   \n\n\nLets be clear you do not respect your SIL or your brother, that's just a cheap excuse to hid your own behaviour. You don't respect their choices or their intelligence with your behaviour. Who knows maybe your resentful or threatend by her or maybe your a bit weird towards your brother, but its deeply unhealthy. So no your \"heart\" was not in the right place", "YTA, you disagreed with their parenting choice and went nuclear. Also it is weird that you are putting this all on Amy. Your brother is an adult and makes decisions about his children with his wife. Neither of them thought that there was an issue with that sitter. If you had a concern you should have mentioned it to your brother. But you didn\u2019t do that, you skipped multiple steps and called CPS. The blowback is justified.", "YTA. For two reasons:\n\n1) you called CPS for absolutely no reason - the children were supervised. The rest was not your concern. \n\n2) You vilify your SIL as though your brother has no part. He left his children with this babysitter also. He didn\u2019t vet. Yet you blame SIL because \u2026 well we all know why. She\u2019s beautiful, right? \n\n3) CPS actually investigated. Let me be clear: CPS would never investigate if the allegation was: \u201cchildren were left with a babysitter.\u201d That is literally what parents are supposed to do. So the only way they investigated if is you lied and added details that were not true. \n\nHow dare you. It\u2019s so obvious that you\u2019re jealous of SIL and you\u2019ve been waiting to take her down. I don\u2019t usually hope for karma, but this post made me do just that.", "YTA so so much. For all the reasons stated above. It\u2019s not like she went on Craigslist for a babysitter.", "I\u2019m a little uncomfortable. Better go completely nuclear on my own family. YTA, you unhinged lunatic", "YTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u2018not your kids not your concern\u2019 issue. You\u2019re a relative and you were worried, that\u2019s valid. But your actions were extreme. \n\nThings like CPS records for calls like yours Can hider the lives of your brothers family. There was a post about an OP who\u2019s MIL called CPS because she \u2018felt\u2019 her grandkids were being neglected, and OP had police and investigators show up at her place for weeks and how stressed it made the kids. \n\nThat\u2019s NOT what you do when you are concerned for someone\u2019s kids. You caused more harm than good.", "YTA for wasting the time of an already over worked service. Instead of actually being an adult and discussing your concerns with your brother, sil or any member of you family, you decide to go nuclear and involve CPS. That\u2019s awful and your family\u2019s reaction is warranted", "The way you describe it, it seems like you were waiting for an opportunity to nail her.   Congratulations.   Your grand prize us a ruined relationship with your brother and his family.  \n\nYTA", "\u201cI have found her to be a bit vain and ditzy, but it\u2019s ok cus I respect her. Not that much though cus after she hired a babysitter to make sure her children were cared for while she was away, I called CPS to have her children taken away for child endangerment. I could\u2019ve had a discussion with them first or offered to watch the kids myself if I was that worried, but out of respect I nuked their family. AITA?\u201d \n\nYTA. \n\nThey were owed a conversation if your concerns were legitimate, and you could\u2019ve offered to watch the kids if you were that worried. You sound like a judgemental jerk. YTA. Hope they go NC.", "YTA.  You obviously don\u2019t understand what true abuse and neglect is or appropriate grounds for calling CPS.  You turned your brother and SIL\u2019s life upside down because you are an idiot.  Sure, not vetting a babysitter is dumb, but certainly not a crime.  CPS is insanely overloaded by real abuse and neglect cases and you just took time and resources away.  Your bf is an AH and so are you, I hope your brother and SIL cut you out of their lives.  If someone did that to me they would not be allowed near my family again.", "Info: besides being pretty, why do you think SIL is a bad person?", "YTA. You had no actual suspicion of them being neglected though. She didn\u2019t leave them alone. \n\nYou didn\u2019t like her lack of a vetting process, which is completely fair. You could have simply called and talked to the sitter yourself or gone over and met here. Or, if you\u2019re that damn concerned, you could have watched your nieces.", "Why didn't you offer to watch the kids?", "I\u2019m surprised CPS even validated your concern with an investigation.", "YTA they should ALL go no contact with you.\n\nIf you did that to my family, I would destroy you. \n\nYou had ZERO knowledge that the children were in danger. \n\nYou took resources away from real problems because of what?!? You disagree with her parenting style!?!\n\nThere is no apology that come back from that.", "Without ages I have to assume you are 13 and that is a good age to learn about fucking around and finding out.\n\nYTA, but you\u2019re in middle school and you can grow out of it.", "I'd say ESH. Yes, you went absolutely nuclear on them before calling and voicing your concerns. However, how many terrible stories do we hear time and time again about babysitters doing awful things to children, even when the parent(s) are actually looking into them? I don't understand why brother and SIL were so okay leaving two young children with a total stranger that they met on the internet. Is it neglect? No. Does it warrant a CPS call? No, but I would have probably called the police for a wellness check at the very most.", "I\u2019m confused by all the \nY  TA. The kids are four and two. Yes the OP should have called her brother and sister-in-law first and expressed her worry. She then might\u2019ve found out more information. But your sister-in-law didn\u2019t even meet this babysitter and she left a two year old with him? I say ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
