We will be gone for a week. Normally we would take our 2 dogs to stay at his aunt\u2019s house as she takes good care of them and has a big yard. However, my FIL is having a surgery he won\u2019t reschedule so his aunt can\u2019t watch them that week because she is staying with FIL. \n\nMy husband paid my MIL $100 to watch them. She\u2019s living with us currently and part of the arrangement is that she lets the dogs out 1x a day because we have a young puppy who needs to go out in the middle of our work day. We\u2019ve had to sit down and talk with her twice already about not doing this. Even if she\u2019s home all day sometimes she doesn\u2019t do it. She once left them in the house all day with no potty breaks because she put on her pain patch and fell asleep for 17 hours straight. \n\nWe found out last night she\u2019s again not been doing the one thing we ask her to do. I told my husband that I am uncomfortable with her keeping the dogs for a week unsupervised because she can\u2019t even take them out once a day, let alone feed them twice and take care of their other needs. I would like to board them but he insists his mom is more trustworthy than \u201csome stranger\u201d and that she is the \u201cbest option.\u201d His brother agrees with him and says she always takes good care of his dog, but I\u2019m just not convinced. \n\nThis led to a big fight because I refuse to budge as the thought of my 6 month old puppy being crated for 9+ hours and having accidents in his crate makes me sick. He refuses to budge because he trusts his mom so much more than a boarding facility.

She doesn't take good care of the dogs obivously so you are NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like this is someone you can\u2019t trust to look after your dogs. \n\nAs someone with puppies, they require a lot of time and energy. Them being crated for a week could do some damage, especially in terms of their training and their own well-being. I\u2019m reading this hoping they\u2019re not already crated that long every day with just a toilet break in between. \n\nI would lean towards boarding them with a professional, personally.", "NTA. A puppy needs a lot of attention and won't be happy spending the day in a crate. Hire a dog walker for routine visits, and increase those visits when you go on vacation.", "NTA.\n\nShe's currently not doing what you've asked and paid her for. Boarders are businesspeople who rely on their good trade to keep more trade coming in, so have an incentive to provide a good quality service.\n\nRealistically, your MIL has a month to prove that she can manage the dogs. I'd increase what you're asking her to do over that period, i.e. walk them, put their food out Etc. And if she's able to do it, then go with her, if not, take them to the boarders.\n\nMy SIL lives at home and they have a dog and sometimes if my PIL are away, the dogs never walked for a full weekend, so family are not always the best to look after your pets because they've become complacent.", "NTA. \n\nshe\u2019s being paid to take care of them and you\u2019ve been clear on what they need, and if they\u2019re not getting it. it\u2019s happened multiple times, doesn\u2019t seem to stop, and they\u2019re simple things that take only minutes to do. whether she\u2019s intentionally ignoring them or not, she\u2019s obviously not fit and able to take care of two dogs at once. \n\nif she isn\u2019t taking care of them properly she\u2019s definitely not \u201cbetter than some stranger\u201d. plus, that \u201cstranger\u201d is trained to take care of animals, it\u2019s literally their job and there would be no reason why there would be anything in the way of that person taking care of your dogs, whereas your MIL obviously has things to do that make her incapable of caring for them. \n\nplus, they\u2019re your dogs. you should decide where they go while you\u2019re away.", "NTA Ya know they say when a puppy has an \u201caccident\u201d you rub its nose in it to teach it a lesson? (I don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t even know if it works).\n\nBut in this case, I am willing to make an exception. So, *when*, not *if*, MIL \u201cputs on a pain patch\u201d, or whatever, and ignores your dog and it can\u2019t help but make a mess.., rub your husbands nose in it. Literally or figuratively, but since your husband is being particularly slow to learn, I\u2019m leaning forward literally. And he can clean it up, too. Somebody has to clean it up, it can be him. Every time.\n\nSometimes, OP, we have to make an executive decision. Sometimes we have to put our foot *down*. MIL isn\u2019t capable, (even if she has good intentions)\u2026 The woman isn\u2019t *capable* of taking care of the dogs for a week.\n\nThe dogs health and well being of is more important than hurting the MIL\u2019s fee fees. It is more important than your husbands denial of his mothers decline and incompetence. It is more important than the money spent getting \u201ca stranger\u201d to watch your dogs.\n\nAnd nobody gives a flying F what your husbands brother thinks about this. They aren\u2019t his dogs and he gets no say.\n\nOP, you may have to just sit this trip out. Whatever it takes.", "She\u2019s already not doing a satisfactory job.... why would anyone hire her & trust her to watch any dogs? .... This is not an option unless you don\u2019t care about your dogs or marriage. \n\nIf the boarding facility told you they would only be taking care of your dogs 3 out of 5 days while you were gone, would you hire them? .... No. So why would anyone think it\u2019s okay to hire your MIL? \n\nNTA", "Well why does he trust her and you don't? Also you say the FIL \"wont\" reschedule the surgery to watch your dogs, why should he? Did you seriously ask him to? From that part of the post I feel like you're kind of entitled and so I wonder why everyone but you has faith in the MIL and if maybe YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You need to board the dogs or he can go alone. If my partner refused to address legitimate concerns about my animals out of some idea of loyalty to his mother, I wouldn't want to spend time with him anyway.", "NTA I'm not a fan of boarding (ours came from a shelter and I don't want her to think she lost her family again) but you should definitely board.   You know they'll be safe and cared for", "NTA. It sounds like MIL has proved repeatedly that she cannot be trusted to take care of your dogs. For this reason she cannot be left with your dogs without supervision. \n\nI see two happy mediums here. Either you tell MIL that she cannot keep the dogs unless she can prove before you leave that she can be trusted. \n\nOR\n\nGet some type of indoor camera like a blink or something. Point it only at the dog cages. Doing this you will not be invading her privacy or \"watching her\" in her home but you can be sure that your dogs are going out like they are supposed to. \n\nI would have a discussion with your husband and tell him because neither of you are willing to give completely on this subject that you find a compromise.", "NTA, but your husband needs therapy.   Tell him to think if these were children and not dogs, cause I hear this exact scenario a lot where people accept horrible free care from grandparents because \"it is better than a stranger\" No it isn't.  Strangers have training, background checks, and won't be doing their job while on pain pills", "YTA, for two reasons: unless it is a cosmetic surgery why in Gods name should your FIL reschedule his surgery for your vacation? And second, you don't go on vacation where you can't take your puppy with you in the first year, at least. Either commit to the dogs, or don't have any, but don't start complaining about the fact that your relatives have lifes on their own. The fact that you both work full time is bad enough, don't get pets if you don't have time to care for them accordingly.", "But still you can meet in the middle with you husband by making sure your MIL take the dogs out.", "Part of the arrangement is that she keeps him out of the crate when she is home so he is not supposed to be in the crate for more than 4-5 hours at a time, but I have suspicions that she just leaves him in there if she doesn\u2019t want to deal with him. I can\u2019t really prove that, though, so I won\u2019t say either way.", "We didn\u2019t ask him to reschedule because of the dogs; we asked him to reschedule because my husband is uncomfortable with the idea of being on a cruise and unreachable while his dad undergoes a procedure, even if it is minor and our vacation is non refundable. We just found out this week about his procedure date. Sorry for that lost context, I just didn\u2019t know that it was relevant to the conflict.", "I would be worried about the impact this could already be having, personally. \n\nDog cameras with treat dispensers for while you\u2019re working, a dog walker who checks in regularly\u2026those could be good shouts here just for general care. \n\nI would definitely push professional boarding from a well-being perspective and see how your partner responds to that. If his mum is using pain patches that can cause her to sleep for 17 hours at a time\u2026she\u2019s not the right person to leave dogs who need a schedule with.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, as others have pointed out, no one should have to reschedule surgery to accommodate other people so I wouldn\u2019t bring that up with your father-in-law.\n\nEdit: I just saw your previous post about your dog, training and where things have gotten worse\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be leaving her alone with your dog even when you\u2019re not on holiday, I would get a professional in to maintain routine.", "Well, you *can* prove it. You can put cameras in your house *to watch your dogs*. We have them and I can tell you it makes me feel so much better to be able to watch my cats when I am not home.\n\nIf you are worried about human \u201cprivacy\u201d or whatever, you can aim the camera at an exterior door. Nobody is going to be prancing around nude, or whatever, in front of a door. Annnd you can see just how many times does that dog go in and out of that doorway. \n\nAlthough if I had somebody taking drugs, (and yes a pain patch is a drug), and sleeping all day, I would be worried about my *house*, TOO. So I would want a \u201cnanny cam\u201d or two or several, just to \u201ccheck on\u201d your MIL. \n\nBut a doorway view would answer your question for you. They can be quite discrete. And inexpensive.", "Get cameras that face the crate and your yard so you can see if they get let outside. I feel bad for your dogs on a typical day. Have you thought of hiring a dog walking company? Not rover but a real insured company", "FIL shouldn't reschedule surgery to accommodate anyone. No matter if it is minor or not. It isn't your husband's or your call to consider it minor. This is between FIL and his doctor.", "Sure, we just asked because my husband hates the idea of being away when his dad needs the help, but he said no and we aren\u2019t pushing it, as it is his choice.", "Thanks! I will invest in a camera for the house.", "There unfortunately aren\u2019t any available in our area. We are having a fence installed the week after we come back from vacation so they will have free access to the yard, and I am taking a new job where I can come home for lunch to care for them too. It\u2019s just the vacation kinda putting a kink in things.", "That makes sense, but my advice at that point would always be to change the holiday. Surgery is a priority when it comes to choosing between the two if your husband can\u2019t cope with that.\n\nAlso, please see the edit in my previous post. I think that you could benefit from someone like a dog walker being present regardless after seeing your post history."]}
