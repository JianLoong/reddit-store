We will be gone for a week. Normally we would take our 2 dogs to stay at his aunt\u2019s house as she takes good care of them and has a big yard. However, my FIL is having a surgery he won\u2019t reschedule so his aunt can\u2019t watch them that week because she is staying with FIL. \n\nMy husband paid my MIL $100 to watch them. She\u2019s living with us currently and part of the arrangement is that she lets the dogs out 1x a day because we have a young puppy who needs to go out in the middle of our work day. We\u2019ve had to sit down and talk with her twice already about not doing this. Even if she\u2019s home all day sometimes she doesn\u2019t do it. She once left them in the house all day with no potty breaks because she put on her pain patch and fell asleep for 17 hours straight. \n\nWe found out last night she\u2019s again not been doing the one thing we ask her to do. I told my husband that I am uncomfortable with her keeping the dogs for a week unsupervised because she can\u2019t even take them out once a day, let alone feed them twice and take care of their other needs. I would like to board them but he insists his mom is more trustworthy than \u201csome stranger\u201d and that she is the \u201cbest option.\u201d His brother agrees with him and says she always takes good care of his dog, but I\u2019m just not convinced. \n\nThis led to a big fight because I refuse to budge as the thought of my 6 month old puppy being crated for 9+ hours and having accidents in his crate makes me sick. He refuses to budge because he trusts his mom so much more than a boarding facility. AITA?\n\nEdit: i didn\u2019t mean to come off as callus saying my FIL wouldn\u2019t reschedule his surgery and it has little relevance to the situation other than his aunt can\u2019t watch them for us. He is having cryotherapy and won\u2019t be anesthetized but has a low pain tolerance so will need help after the procedure. My husband asked him to reschedule because he didn\u2019t want to be away from home during the procedure.\n\nAlso, I know us both working full time away from home is not ideal for them, but I am starting a new job where I can work from home and also am close enough to come home during the day for a midday walk with them when I am in office. I start next week; asking her to help daily wasn\u2019t a permanent solution, just a fix while I found a job that allowed me to be a better pet parent.", "created_utc": 1679397395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xdttp/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_my_dogs_with_my_mil/", "score": 356, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know they'll be safe and cared for", "NTA. It sounds like MIL has proved repeatedly that she cannot be trusted to take care of your dogs.

Tell him to think if these were children and not dogs, cause I hear this exact scenario a lot where people accept horrible free care from grandparents because \"it is better than a stranger\" No it isn't.

And second, you don't go on vacation where you can't take your puppy with you in the first year, at least. Either commit to the dogs, or don't have any, but don't start complaining about the fact that your relatives have lifes on their own. The fact that you both work full time is bad enough, don't get pets if you don't have time to care for them accordingly.", "But still you can meet in the middle with you husband by making sure your MIL take the dogs out.", "Part of the arrangement is that she keeps him out of the crate when she is home so he is not supposed to be in the crate for more than 4-5 hours at a time, but I have suspicions that she just leaves him in there if she doesn\u2019t want to deal with him. I can\u2019t really prove that, though, so I won\u2019t say either way.", "We didn\u2019t ask him to reschedule because of the dogs; we asked him to reschedule because my husband is uncomfortable with the idea of being on a cruise and unreachable while his dad undergoes a procedure, even if it is minor and our vacation is non refundable.

Sorry for that lost context, I just didn\u2019t know that it was relevant to the conflict.", "I would be worried about the impact this could already be having, personally. \n\nDog cameras with treat dispensers for while you\u2019re working, a dog walker who checks in regularly\u2026those could be good shouts here just for general care. \n\nI would definitely push professional boarding from a well-being perspective and see how your partner responds to that. If his mum is using pain patches that can cause her to sleep for 17 hours at a time\u2026she\u2019s not the right person to leave dogs who need a schedule with.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, as others have pointed out, no one should have to reschedule surgery to accommodate other people so I wouldn\u2019t bring that up with your father-in-law.\n\nEdit: I just saw your previous post about your dog, training and where things have gotten worse\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be leaving her alone with your dog even when you\u2019re not on holiday, I would get a professional in to maintain routine.", "Well, you *can* prove it. You can put cameras in your house *to watch your dogs*. We have them and I can tell you it makes me feel so much better to be able to watch my cats when I am not home.\n\nIf you are worried about human \u201cprivacy\u201d or whatever, you can aim the camera at an exterior door. Nobody is going to be prancing around nude, or whatever, in front of a door. Annnd you can see just how many times does that dog go in and out of that doorway. \n\nAlthough if I had somebody taking drugs, (and yes a pain patch is a drug), and sleeping all day, I would be worried about my *house*, TOO. So I would want a \u201cnanny cam\u201d or two or several, just to \u201ccheck on\u201d your MIL. \n\nBut a doorway view would answer your question for you. They can be quite discrete. And inexpensive.", "Get cameras that face the crate and your yard so you can see if they get let outside. I feel bad for your dogs on a typical day. Have you thought of hiring a dog walking company? Not rover but a real insured company", "FIL shouldn't reschedule surgery to accommodate anyone. No matter if it is minor or not. It isn't your husband's or your call to consider it minor.

I will invest in a camera for the house.", "There unfortunately aren\u2019t any available in our area.

It\u2019s just the vacation kinda putting a kink in things.", "That makes sense, but my advice at that point would always be to change the holiday.

I think that you could benefit from someone like a dog walker being present regardless after seeing your post history.", "NTA. A boarding facility does this for a living. You can see reviews of their work.  You can ask people for recommendations. If they are terrible, they will probably go out of business.  This is the one thing they are accountable for and you have ways to know if they do it well.\n\nYour MIL has already figured out that if she does a terrible job, it doesn't matter at all.

Over the counter painkillers, like Tylenol, won't make you sleep that long (unless you're really quite sick and in a debilitated state). So these pain patches must be prescribed by the doctor and would surely have been to treat a tough painful condition. OP hasn't included any more medical details but any condition requiring that sort of level of pain control means that her MIL probably isn't really in a physical position to meet the needs of a demanding puppy. It would be *protecting* her MIL, not insulting her, to arrange for professional boarding.", "How would that work? \u201cIf my dogs die while we\u2019re on vacation because you neglected them, we\u2019ll be very angry with you!\u201d", "Great point!", "Can you skip the vacation? I see it's a nonrefundable cruise. Can you transfer it to someone else? \n\nIt sounds like you might need to be there for FIL and you can't trust your MIL that lives with you (why is that?) You are putting in a fence and will have a new job soon.", "I guess it wouldn't work. I guess boarding facility is better option for OP", "NTA, but you might get better results if you reframe this to your husband. You aren't accusing your MIL of being irresponsible or lazy or any kind of character flaw. You're saying it's not fair on her (or the dogs) to put that on her shoulders in her current state of health. Lean hard on that \"it's not fair to your mom\".\n\nWhile she may have been fine with the responsibility in the past, right now she cannot possibly cope with the responsibility of looking after the dogs for a solid week without you if she is already struggling just looking after them during the day. Sleeping for 17 hours due to a pain patch is not compatible with potty-training a young dog with a small bladder. Neither is forgetting/neglecting to feed the dogs regularly. She clearly needs less responsibility, and also possibly someone to check in on her wellbeing while you're away!\n\n(Also? I am baffled that your husband can look at this situation, and still think that full-time professionals are less trustworthy than a woman who can't even be relied on to let the dogs go potty once a day!)", "Put in a camera or two to keep tabs if you're that worried. NTA", "NTA: the compromise here would be to cancel the vacation if you can't agree on who should care for the dog. \n\nAsk your husband if he's willing to do that. If he isn't, make arrangements to have them boarded, and make it clear that you're not arguing.  \n\nI know I'll get down voted for this because ultimatums are generally unhealthy, but when someone isn't willing to bend, and the safety of a loved one and/or living being is involved, you do what needs to be done. It's wonderful he wants to trust MIL. Quite frankly, if MIL is using pain patches, she probably only agreed to do him a favor anyway. If you go on vacation and she leaves the dogs crated, you're going to be fighting even worse afterwards. So ask him to choose between two choices that don't require you to be worried.", "Obviously your MIL is not caring for your dogs but if you and your husband are both out at work all day then honestly, you shouldn't have them. I know that's harsh but it's true - you're rightly saying that your MIL isn't taking care of them, but if she wasn't living there what would you do? They're your dogs, not hers.", "You have no choice but to put your dogs in a professional facility! You can get a camera (I mentioned in earlier comment) and aim it at the crate. Cost you maybe $35 and the app is free if you get a Wyze cam. But that's only going to help while you're in town to make sure she's taking him out of his crate. \n\nIt's not going to do you any good once you've left town because how are you going to wake her up if she's sleeping 17 hours because she put on a pain patch? You're not going to and your dogs are going to be alone! Not to mention this puppy is still in the training phase leaving him in his crate for 17 hours where he shits in his crate is going to set him back so badly! Crate training only works if they are never allowed to potty in the crate. Once they see it as acceptable to go in the crate, it's going to be practically impossible to get him out of that. \n\nNTA sometimes you just need a professional to do a job.", "NTA.

Why would your husband believe she will care for the dogs properly when you are gone, and who knows how long they will be kenneled without letting them out. Does your vet also board pets? We have found that when we travel, our dogs are well taken care of when being boarded at the vets.

She can't or won't do that one thing.\n\nHow is she more reliable than some random stranger? I feel sorry for the dogs, and I'm not really a dog person.  Nope. Your MiL is not reliable at all.\n\nNTA", "YTA - MIL needs more help. She is getting old and WTF slept for 17 hours and no one called a doctor. MIL and the dogs need a sitter.", "NTA I would google pet sitters and/or pet walkers.\n\nIf your mil can't take care of them now what makes your husband think she's going to change?", "NTA - If she has \u2018difficulty\u2019 taking your dogs out once a day, then she shouldn\u2019t be trusted with them.", "seriously, doggie daycare exists for a reason", "Worked at a doggie daycare/boarding/grooming.  Yeah, everyone we hired was better than op 's mil. Our guests got unlimited play time during the day, snack/, lunch/ suite breaks if the owner wanted it. we were a no crate facility and staffed 24/7 with an overnight person who did checks.  Even the dogs who couldn't join in the playtime, aka dogs with major issues, got to go out to go potty and one on one play every 2-3 hours.   We only hired dog lovers and all the staff got to bring their dogs for free. So there are definitely good boarding options out there!  That said, its definitely a luxury thing and not everyone can afford it which sucks", "She can give them attention during the day but have a pet sitter come 2x a day for walks/exercise/food.", "I accepted a job where I can work from home and come home during the day to care for them because I realize that is both working full time away isn\u2019t good for them. I start next week.", "Would have already done it if we had a commercial service around. Unfortunately we live in a fairly rural area and there isn\u2019t anything available except Rover.", "I didn\u2019t mean it like that; he\u2019s having an outpatient procedure he won\u2019t even be anesthetized for, and my husband asked him to reschedule because he has intense anxiety about leaving his dad when he may need help. He declined and we aren\u2019t pushing it any more as it\u2019s his choice. We don\u2019t expect him to reschedule my husband just wanted to explore the possibility so he could be with his dad.", "I didn\u2019t mean it in that way, I swear. My husband asked him to reschedule not because of the dogs, but because he\u2019s worried about not being there for him. He is having cryotherapy so he won\u2019t be anesthetized but has a low pain tolerance so he wanted to be home to help. FIL said he wasn\u2019t interested in rescheduling and that he would be fine without him and we haven\u2019t pushed it any further. I apologize for how I worded it. I would never expect someone to move a medical procedure and my husband asked so we could be home to help if he needed it.", "I\u2019m asking myself (and my husband) that exact question.", "I wasn\u2019t there at the time, I was traveling for work. Apparently she\u2019s done this her entire life according to my husband. She will put the fentanyl patch on and sleep like that and she did it when he was little so I guess he thinks it\u2019s normal. I am not equipped to help her and any form of suggestion that she is an addict and needs help doesn\u2019t come well received even if it is well meaning. I honestly don\u2019t know what to do about it at this point because neither of them believe she has a problem.", "Put up a nanny cam, pointed at the crate, and document how long she leaves him locked up.", "You need cameras then.", "Automate it.\n\nMake a safe area for the dog(s) to be in uncrated.\n\n2 patches of real grass for potty (you will have to teach them to go on the grass inside most likely, some dogs take to it very easily) \n\nA  camera/treat dispenser where you can see them, talk to them, and give them treats.\n\nA dog walker a couple times a week or doggie daycare as a mid day activity for them.\n\n3 gallon gravity water bowl\n\nFood before leaving and when you come home\n\nNo, its not ideal.  But pre pandemic most dog owners worked outside of the home and made it work.", "Get a Furbo (pet camera that you can toss treats from) or something similar, that way you can see how long they're being crated and have evidence if your MIL isn't taking proper care of the dogs like you suspect. It seems like without some kind of proof your husband isn't going to see the truth that his mother is not the correct choice for this task, he's been too blinded by the fact that its his mom. \n\nI suggest a Furbo rather than just a regular camera purely because I feel like it would be an easier conversation for why it's being installed. A regular camera would probably make your MIL feel spied on and not trusted (fairly enough) which will trigger defensiveness. The furbo though could totally be played off as you missing your pup and just wanting to be able to see him and give him treats while you're away which will probably be a much easier sell for hubbie and MIL.", "Thank you for clarification\n\nEdited comment.", "If your husband wanted to be there for fil's procedure, the onus is on you to change your vacation, not ask for the medical procedure (!!!) to be moved.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you and your husband both have skewed priorities and this is just the first time you've been at odds over them.\n\nIn your mind, your vacation > his medical procedure, therefore, you raised if he'd move it.\n\nIn your husband's mind, his mother's ego > your dog's well being, therefore he is content with her being responsible for them in your absence.\n\nFor most people, neither of these would even be raised as a possibility. That both of them have been for you is not unrelated.", "The patches are Fentanyl.", "Fentanyl granny and puppies just don't go together", "Nope, do not leave her alone with the dogs, hard pass. NTA and be aware that she can nod off by herself and become in danger of respiratory failure if she\u2019s allowed unrestricted access to the patches. Definitely board the dogs instead."]}
