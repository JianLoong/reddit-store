Tonight, we met up at a local arcade/bar. It was our third time meeting up, the first two dates had gone well. \n\nAt one point, Henry and I were playing one of the games. A girl went to squeeze by, bumped into me a bit to where I spilled a bit of my drink, and immediately apologized to me. It was obviously not on purpose, so I told her it was fine and not to worry, and she lingered for a minute - saying how fun the bar is and complimenting the outfit I was wearing. I said thanks and she apologized again and told Henry and I to have a great night. \n\nAs soon as she left, Henry said, \u201cWhat was her deal?\u201d He said that she was weird, that she should have just apologized and kept moving. I told him it was a normal thing, she was probably a little tipsy. \n\nA little while later I went back to the bar to order a couple more drinks, and \u201cSarah\u201d happened to be there too. While we waited, we chatted a bit more. The bartender brought my drinks over, I told Sarah to have fun, and I returned to Henry. He made a lighthearted comment about my new best friend. \n\nAs we went to leave, Sarah was there too, so we were all standing out front (Sarah and a couple of her friends) waiting for our Ubers. Henry kept asking me if I was sure I didn\u2019t want him to drive me home. I declined a couple times, and finally told him, \u201cI told you I\u2019m not comfortable getting in your car yet, I\u2019m gonna take an Uber.\u201d I was friendly but firm, and he immediately apologized and stopped asking. \n\nAll of a sudden, Sarah said, \u201cOmg I think I know where I recognize you from! You live down the hall from \u201cAnna\u201d! (her friend who nods and says \u201comg yeah!\u201d) Do you want to split an Uber with us?\u201d Spoiler: I\u2019ve never met them, we\u2019re not neighbors, they were looking out. I felt perfectly safe, so I said no thanks, I appreciated it, and I would see them around. \n\nTheir car came, and when they left, Henry asked what that was all about - I laughed and said something like, \u201cOh, they were just looking out and making sure I was safe. They might have heard what I said about getting in your car.\u201d He got kind of mad, and asked why I didn\u2019t stick up for him. I told him there wasn\u2019t anything to stick up for - it\u2019s the girl code, we all knew it, and as soon as I turned them down they were fine. \n\nMy Uber came then, he told me to get home safe. I brushed it off, and texted when I got home to let him know and say I\u2019d had a good time. He immediately came back with \u201cI did too until I got accused of being some creep and you didn\u2019t stick up for me. You could have said I was a good guy. You left me there by myself with those other people who probably all thought I was some sort of creep too.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m conflicted on even asking this, but AITA for not making it explicitly clear that Henry was not making me feel unsafe or uncomfortable?\n\nEDIT:\nThank you to everyone for your feedback and insight. I figured I\u2019d address some of the more common things I\u2019ve seen in the comments:\n\n- No, I don\u2019t think he spiked my drink. Sarah bumped into me very slightly, and only a tiny bit of my drink sloshed over the edge of the glass. I think if she had suspected that she would have approached it differently, or at least I would have in that position. \n\n- No, I don\u2019t think Sarah was hitting on me, lol. I think she was just a friendly person who happened to be on the same \u201cbar schedule\u201d as me. \n\n- I was comfortable getting in an Uber with a complete stranger because Uber has (admittedly somewhat poor) regulations, I could share my ride info with a friend, it has an emergency SOS button, and I always get dropped off at a business close by to my home, never directly at my address. I did not want to get in Henry\u2019s car because of the potential pressure of the situation. This is a man I don\u2019t know very well, who may have some expectation of intimacy, driving me alone to my house, and if anything had gone badly then or in the future he\u2019d know where I live. This boundary doesn\u2019t exist because of Henry himself, it exists because I\u2019ve been in a bad outcome of that position before and would like to not be there again. \n\n- I had let Henry know my dealbreakers before agreeing to a first date: no unsolicited spicy photos or I\u2019m out, I am more comfortable driving myself/arranging my own transport until I get to know you better. He agreed with them when I brought them up and we had actually had a decent conversation about why they\u2019re things I feel strongly about. It wasn\u2019t a surprise to him that I wouldn\u2019t be taking a ride home with him. \n\n- I didn\u2019t find it weird that I was drinking and he wasn\u2019t - it\u2019s a bar/arcade, so it\u2019s not like he just had to sit there and watch me drink. He also had a longer ride home than me, the bar is closer to my town than his. I just assumed he didn\u2019t want to pay big bucks for an Uber.", "created_utc": 1689307706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14z5vv2/aita_for_not_sticking_up_for_my_date_when_a_girl/", "score": 1450, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hard to judge someone like this.

It\u2019s girl code, they wanted to make sure you were okay, I get that could make him uncomfortable but you can\u2019t help that.

Guys that have to tell you they are good guys often are the opposite.", "NTA. I\u2019m a guy.

Red flags all around.\n\nFind someone else.", "NTA Why is he so focused on this? It's a little concerning that he's playing the \"I'm a good guy card\" over such a small thing.  All they were doing was making sure you were safe.  You turning down the ride told them you were, and that he wasn't a problem.", "I won\u2019t make a judgement because you would know better whether Henry had good intentions or not. but one alternative explanation for his pushiness is that the guy is trying to be nice and wants to do you a favor of driving you home, saving you the Uber fee and hoping to spend more time with you.\n\n I say this because it\u2019s the kind of thing my brother would do because he wants to be helpful. But ultimately you\u2019ll know better whether the guy has good intentions or not. \n\nI can sorta see where the guy is coming from though. If indeed he\u2019s innocent, it would\u2019ve felt hurtful that someone implied he\u2019s a creep three times. Men don\u2019t understand the girl code and might take it personally if not explained to them well. As a sister, I\u2019ve had to explain several things about the girl code to my brother about why girls go to the bathroom in groups, why it\u2019s not safe to walk alone at night, and that yes men are inherently significantly stronger than women. \n\nHis hurt is understandable, but how you guys move forward will determine the relationship. If you want to continue the relationship, take some time to have a conversation with him about boundaries.

Maybe do some self-introspection to figure why I\u2019m giving off some vibes that would cause a girl code check in.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he needs to go, but an honest convo before date 4 May come in useful.   Why is he so sensitive to strangers opinions? Why is his ego now ruined his night? And by telling you, trying to hinder your memory of a fun night.\n\nUp front and brutal honesty about your boundaries early is way easier than after months of this.", "Thank you for saying this. Most replies here have had very good points and pointed out some areas of concern, and while I value the outside opinions, I still found myself trying to come up with excuses for why this situation was bad but he might still be overall good. \n\nYour edit cut through that. You\u2019re right. Someone who waited until I had lowered inhibitions to try and push a boundary that he knew about that I have to help me feel and stay safe is absolutely bad news.", "He\u2019s being unreasonable and shifty.", "Good point. Like why is he so sensitive about being possibly misaligned by a person he didn't even want to talk to earlier.", "That's what has me scratching me head.

I don\u2019t get those vibes from him but I didn\u2019t from them either.

It's also good for you to stay within your own healthy boundaries. \n\nBut I do want to point out that he's probably feeling some dating burnout. Entertainment dates like bars,movies, and arcades don't really create an environment for really getting to know someone, and they aren't financially sustainable for many people either. He might be feeling that and then hears people think he's being creepy.

Something can't be \"a code\" while also being \"clear and obvious to everyone\". That said, I guess the onlookers would basically be split between those who aren't oblivious (who didn't think he was a creep because they understood the code) and those are oblivious (who didn't think he was a creep because they were oblivious).

I was thinking let\u2019s do something other than dinner, but maybe the bar was a bit overstimulating.", "It doesn\u2019t really mean she fearful of him it\u2019s just a better safe then sorry thing, just a precaution because she\u2019s had a bad experience with these things before", "And again, we ask, how are we supposed to know? OP is obviously interested in Henry, and hasn\u2019t seen any flags (before tonight) that make her unwilling to continue getting to know him, but that doesn\u2019t mean she should automatically assume she can trust him implicitly.

You haven't lived as a woman.", "There is a big difference between \u201cafraid to be alone with him\u201d and \u201caware that some people will take advantage of a compromised or vulnerable situation, such as enclosing yourself in a small space with someone you don\u2019t know super well after you\u2019ve been drinking and when the other person may have some personal expectation of intimacy\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for feedback on my boundaries, they exist for many reasons and were communicated clearly from the jump.

If she said the same on the second date I would just think she\u2019s a little over cautious, but hardly to an extreme. If by the third date she was still uncomfortable riding him with me I would feel hurt, like I did something wrong. I guess the question is \u201cdoes Henry do anything in particular that makes you distrustful of him?\u201d \n\nBack to the point though, I know I would be kinda hurt by the fact that some stranger thought I was a creep, and I would certainly be hurt that the woman I\u2019m with didn\u2019t feel the need to amend the misunderstanding.

Those girls sound awesome, he sounds like you might need to proceed with caution as he may be overly sensitive.", "I think pretty easy NTA. \nDoesn\u2019t seem like anybody but Henry did anything wrong, and he may just be a little sensitive about your boundaries and want to seem like he\u2019s putting his best foot forward in a new relationship, resulting in him stepping in it. \n\nI think it\u2019s not reasonable but understandable that he may have disliked you talking with Sarah so much on a third date. But he definitely crossed a line with constantly trying to take you home, once is polite, twice is nagging or bad flirting imo but 3 times is definitely excessive.\n\nI think if you think this was a one off or see other potential good things about him you can have a conversation with him about no meaning no and girls sticking up for eachother and see how he responds. If not I think it\u2019s no harm no foul and you can both move on", "NTA. My bf loves the way random girls take care of each other when we go out. He supports me going out because of this.

They were so hesitant and clearly trying to refuse. I straight up told them don\u2019t go with him, and said I\u2019ll deal with them if they want. They told him no, and thanked me for giving them the confidence to say no etc. He was a proper weirdo saying he might stop and get dinner (and they\u2019d have to eat with him) and how they have to go to his hotel because it\u2019s so close and much cheaper etc. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. \n\nThis happens all the time, we are not safe and have to help each other!\n\nYour date needs an attitude adjustment", "So I think his reaction to this says a lot \u2026 overly defensive maybe. Not respecting boundaries by still insisting after a no is a red flag. I would reconsider this guy it\u2019s not like those women made a huge deal or accused him of anything they were just offering another way out if YOU felt unsafe and it was entirely non confrontational. You are right there was nothing to defend and him getting overly defensive about it is not a good sign. They didn\u2019t accuse him of a thing.", "NTA. He barely knows you and is already blaming you for your perfectly normal behavior during the date. You did nothing wrong, and his misplaced blame is a huge red flag.

Good night.\"\n\nIf your date makes you feel like dirt, even if it's obviously not intentional, it's ok to end things. He does need to be polite, fully understand OP's situation and just move along.

Introspection might reveal some things he'd rather not think too critically of so his reaction is to lash out. \n\nNot a good trait.", "It's really gross you're getting downvoted for this very accurate assessment.", "They didn't imply anything the first two times they ran into each other, just had a couple accidental run ins at a bar they both clearly frequent atm and were making casual friends. The only time they did or said anything that would imply they thought Henry wasn't acting in good faith was when they saw a sober man pressuring a tipsy woman to get into his car even when she was actively telling him she wasn't okay with that yet, which is *absolutely* creep behavior. \n\nHis hurt is not understandable. His reaction should be \"damn why did my behavior come across bad enough they felt they needed to give her an out and what should I fix?\"", ">but one alternative explanation for his pushiness is that the guy is trying to be nice and wants to do you a favor of driving you home, saving you the Uber fee and hoping to spend more time with you.\n\nI like how this isn't even a consideration for any of the NTA people, even though it's more likely than not the case.

If that's how it went down, I don't think it was a pressure situation. If he asked if you wanted a ride and you said no and he kept saying \"come on, let me drive you\" a few times, then that's pressure. They way he asked and how many times and tone of voice make a difference here.

He would creat a scenario, where he'd make himself look like completely helpless and beg a potential victim to do him a small favour. I. e. he'd put on some bandage and acted like a college student, with a broken arm, who was struggling to get some library books to his car. Who would say no to that tiny favour of carrying a few books around the corner for a helpless guy? How could that be dangerous? \n\nOr he would dress like a police officer and create a story around the victim being a victim of crime and therefor getting their trust. \n\nThe expectation of women to be obedient and caring only played in his cards. None of his victims where ever attracted to him (or at least not that much to let go of every safety precaution).

Because you would offer the lift but then probably not get offended after everything that happened there right? But he got offended and felt this girl he's only met a few times should have been telling strangers how great he was and how he wasn't a creep, and start bringing that up in a big way after they just offered a subtle lift together and took her no immediately as an OK.\n\nBasically he doesn't understand that whole interaction, her choice and what it shows, and he feels like a victim to random girls looking out for one another. Very 'nice guy' imo.\n\nIt's not necessarily that he will do anything. But that's just not the type of social queues that tell you someone is going to be a good long term partner and might at least, end up being a nightmare to be with.

Even if you don't think about it or notice it majorly, your subconscious does. OP might find there's some guys she would feel totally comfortable getting in the car with, but it's not him.
