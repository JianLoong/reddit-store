Tonight, we met up at a local arcade/bar. It was our third time meeting up, the first two dates had gone well. \n\nAt one point, Henry and I were playing one of the games. A girl went to squeeze by, bumped into me a bit to where I spilled a bit of my drink, and immediately apologized to me. It was obviously not on purpose, so I told her it was fine and not to worry, and she lingered for a minute - saying how fun the bar is and complimenting the outfit I was wearing. I said thanks and she apologized again and told Henry and I to have a great night. \n\nAs soon as she left, Henry said, \u201cWhat was her deal?\u201d He said that she was weird, that she should have just apologized and kept moving. I told him it was a normal thing, she was probably a little tipsy. \n\nA little while later I went back to the bar to order a couple more drinks, and \u201cSarah\u201d happened to be there too. While we waited, we chatted a bit more. The bartender brought my drinks over, I told Sarah to have fun, and I returned to Henry. He made a lighthearted comment about my new best friend. \n\nAs we went to leave, Sarah was there too, so we were all standing out front (Sarah and a couple of her friends) waiting for our Ubers. Henry kept asking me if I was sure I didn\u2019t want him to drive me home. I declined a couple times, and finally told him, \u201cI told you I\u2019m not comfortable getting in your car yet, I\u2019m gonna take an Uber.\u201d I was friendly but firm, and he immediately apologized and stopped asking. \n\nAll of a sudden, Sarah said, \u201cOmg I think I know where I recognize you from! You live down the hall from \u201cAnna\u201d! (her friend who nods and says \u201comg yeah!\u201d) Do you want to split an Uber with us?\u201d Spoiler: I\u2019ve never met them, we\u2019re not neighbors, they were looking out. I felt perfectly safe, so I said no thanks, I appreciated it, and I would see them around. \n\nTheir car came, and when they left, Henry asked what that was all about - I laughed and said something like, \u201cOh, they were just looking out and making sure I was safe. They might have heard what I said about getting in your car.\u201d He got kind of mad, and asked why I didn\u2019t stick up for him. I told him there wasn\u2019t anything to stick up for - it\u2019s the girl code, we all knew it, and as soon as I turned them down they were fine. \n\nMy Uber came then, he told me to get home safe. I brushed it off, and texted when I got home to let him know and say I\u2019d had a good time. He immediately came back with \u201cI did too until I got accused of being some creep and you didn\u2019t stick up for me. You could have said I was a good guy. You left me there by myself with those other people who probably all thought I was some sort of creep too.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m conflicted on even asking this, but AITA for not making it explicitly clear that Henry was not making me feel unsafe or uncomfortable?", "created_utc": 1689307706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14z5vv2/aita_for_not_sticking_up_for_my_date_when_a_girl/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I should adjust my approach. I\u2019m glad that strangers are out here in the world looking out for each other. \n\nThis relationship is not worthy of a fourth encounter\n\nETA (after reading responses to comments):\nIf he asked more than once when he was sober and you had drank, he is bad news and those women were on point with their actions. He is bad news.", "NTA.\n\nThey asked in code. You answered in code. Everything\u2019s kosher here. He\u2019s being unreasonable.", "NTA. Henry needs to learn to relax. He also sounds like he's potentially the very jealous and controlling type. Being weird about you chatting with other ladies is a big red flag.", "NTA, you probably would have said those things if you thought them but i\u2019m betting you are picking up the same red flags everyone on here is. time to move on girl.", "NTA.\n\nYour date is taking stuff personally, which he should learn not to take personally. Hard to judge someone like this. Take Ted Bundy as an example, honestly still think the guy looked safer and nicer than normal, even though he was anything but.\n\nYour whole story makes it sound a bit like this girl reached out to you fairly early on your date though. If girls come trying to save you from this guy all the time, then maybe he is giving off some really terrible vibes, which makes it a bit more understandable that he is taking it personally.", "NTA  I might text him back, \u201c Just to clarify, your takeaway from this evening\u2019s events is how unfair life is for *you?\u201d* Then I would block him.", "NTA. His reactions to this were just...off.   Anyone getting that annoyed at what women have to do to keep themselves safe gets major side-eye from me.", "NTA but all of this is a major red flag", "You did stick up for him by saying no thanks you were fine\u2026that\u2019s the whole point, everyone would have thought he was a creep and you taken them up on the offer \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, not even a little bit. It\u2019s girl code, they wanted to make sure you were okay, I get that could make him uncomfortable but you can\u2019t help that. Plus they probably wouldn\u2019t have done that if he took no for an answer the first time.", "NTA\n\nHenry is being a creep by not just letting it go. Guys that have to tell you they are good guys often are the opposite.", "NTA. I\u2019m a guy. Do not have a fourth date. \n\nIf he asked multiple times to drive you home after you had declined, he\u2019s got an ulterior motive. \n\nThen being butthurt about you \u201cnot standing up for him\u201d.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be dealing with this on a third date. Red flags all around.\n\nFind someone else.", "NTA Why is he so focused on this? It's a little concerning that he's playing the \"I'm a good guy card\" over such a small thing.  All they were doing was making sure you were safe.  You turning down the ride told them you were, and that he wasn't a problem.", "I won\u2019t make a judgement because you would know better whether Henry had good intentions or not. but one alternative explanation for his pushiness is that the guy is trying to be nice and wants to do you a favor of driving you home, saving you the Uber fee and hoping to spend more time with you.\n\n I say this because it\u2019s the kind of thing my brother would do because he wants to be helpful. But ultimately you\u2019ll know better whether the guy has good intentions or not. \n\nI can sorta see where the guy is coming from though. If indeed he\u2019s innocent, it would\u2019ve felt hurtful that someone implied he\u2019s a creep three times. Men don\u2019t understand the girl code and might take it personally if not explained to them well. As a sister, I\u2019ve had to explain several things about the girl code to my brother about why girls go to the bathroom in groups, why it\u2019s not safe to walk alone at night, and that yes men are inherently significantly stronger than women. \n\nHis hurt is understandable, but how you guys move forward will determine the relationship. If you want to continue the relationship, take some time to have a conversation with him about boundaries.

He is making it all about him and his feelings, instead of considering yours.", "NTA but this guy is bad news hon", "Guys demanding that they are a good guy, usually aren't a good guy. \nNTA.", "NTA - Henry is thin skinned.

Misplaced accusations can hurt careers.", "[deleted]", "Let\u2019s of great points above and I\u2019d like to give my opinion as a dude.\n\nNTA. \n\nA guys priority should be safety over ego. His ego is being pushed to a higher level than your safety. If someone were to check in with my GF in girl code while we were out, I\u2019d be stoked.  Maybe do some self-introspection to figure why I\u2019m giving off some vibes that would cause a girl code check in.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he needs to go, but an honest convo before date 4 May come in useful.   Why is he so sensitive to strangers opinions? Why is his ego now ruined his night? And by telling you, trying to hinder your memory of a fun night.\n\nUp front and brutal honesty about your boundaries early is way easier than after months of this.", "Thank you for saying this. Most replies here have had very good points and pointed out some areas of concern, and while I value the outside opinions, I still found myself trying to come up with excuses for why this situation was bad but he might still be overall good. \n\nYour edit cut through that. You\u2019re right. Someone who waited until I had lowered inhibitions to try and push a boundary that he knew about that I have to help me feel and stay safe is absolutely bad news.", "He\u2019s being unreasonable and shifty.", "Good point. Like why is he so sensitive about being possibly misaligned by a person he didn't even want to talk to earlier.", "That's what has me scratching me head. She basically confirmed that he wasn't any danger to her. What did he want her to do? Get in a fist fight with the other woman? The fact that he's so hung up on this is really weird.", "Character limit didn\u2019t allow me to give enough detail but I should have found a way to include this - I drank alcohol, he had sodas because he drove. No drinking and driving involved.", "I guess I\u2019ll take that one on myself, I don\u2019t have an issue getting in HIS car but I\u2019m a single woman in a somewhat vulnerable position (had been drinking a bit) and I have only been out with him three times including tonight \u2026 better safe than sorry.", "Good point. Actually, to make sure future dates don\u2019t get unfairly painted with the same brush, why don\u2019t you adopt the practice of wearing a t-shirt with NOT A R\\*PIST printed on it with a big right-pointing arrow?", "think of it this way, you\u2019ve got too slightly tipsy girls. they see another girl multiple times saying she doesn\u2019t want to go home with a guy. what thoughts do you think are going through their minds? this girl could be in danger, he could follow her, he could hurt her, he could SA her, he could kidnap her etc. falsely accusing someone can hurt but it\u2019s also the e best thing to do when you aren\u2019t sure.", "Where are you getting that impression?", "He pushed multiple times for you to get in his car, because he\u2019s at the very least, hoping it leads to sex back at your place. \n\nHe\u2019s upset about someone thinking he might be a creep, because he is in fact a creep.", "I\u2019m not usually good with words, and I often knee-jerk react to these situations with a lot of vitriol. I\u2019m really glad I was able to cut through my own bullshit and offer you a perspective that is helpful.

You can always change your mind.", "[deleted]", "Good point. Actually, that only works if the date remains to the right at all times.\n\nIf OP was happy to clarify matters with Henry in the Uber queue after Sarah and Anne left, I fail to see what it would have cost OP to tell Sarah et al \"No thanks, Henry is fine, it's just we're only on our third date.\".", "This Sarah woman was clearly making Henry uncomfortably, justifiably it would appear, and OP just invalidated those feelings, used those feeling against him, and made a post to further try and invalidate those feelings.

I don\u2019t get those vibes from him but I didn\u2019t from them either. I enjoyed the two other times I went out with him, and feel more comfortable and able to enjoy myself and get to know him more if I\u2019m not anxious about \u201coh shit what if this goes south on the way home\u201d and just handle my own transportation.", "Women get assaulted by their husbands, their friends, their family members, their co-workers\u2026what are you talking about?", "After which date is a woman supposed to know for certain whether her partner is going to assault her?? Is there a secret hand signal we\u2019re supposed to be watching for or something?", "Because that much detail wasn\u2019t necessary.  She did tell them he was fine\u2026by declining their offer. It just didn\u2019t happen to be the way Henry wanted it.  But then, if Henry hadn\u2019t kept pushing to drive her home, she wouldn\u2019t have had to tell him that she\u2019s not comfortable enough yet to get in his car and these women wouldn\u2019t initiated the girl code.  So one could reasonably argue that Henry did, in fact, engage in slightly creepy behavior.", "That\u2019s what her response said. \n\nSarah: OMG, I know you, we\u2019re all three going to the same place, wanna share a ride? (Hey girl, the vibes a little off, are you good? Do you need an excuse to get away from him?)\n\nOP: No, thank you, that\u2019s so sweet, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around though! (Thank you so much, I\u2019m good with him, I appreciate you looking out!) \n\nAs soon as Sarah heard that answer, she knew OP was good. It\u2019s not OPs fault that Henry was paying attention enough to realize what Sarah was really asking, but apparently didn\u2019t understand that OPs answer was clear and obvious to everyone else who may have overheard.", "I don't want to stick up for Henry because he needs to grow thicker skin. It's also good for you to stay within your own healthy boundaries. \n\nBut I do want to point out that he's probably feeling some dating burnout. Entertainment dates like bars,movies, and arcades don't really create an environment for really getting to know someone, and they aren't financially sustainable for many people either. He might be feeling that and then hears people think he's being creepy. Dude sounds like he's dating because he wants a girlfriend, which is a reasonable position to be in. \n\nCould be a red flag on him, could be he's seeing one on you too, both, etc.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "The fact that Henry apologised and dropped it immediately makes me hesitant to go so far as to call it creepy, but perhaps you're right. To me, Henry sounded a bit clueless and awkward rather than creepy.", "There's a logical contradiction in what you're saying. Something can't be \"a code\" while also being \"clear and obvious to everyone\". That said, I guess the onlookers would basically be split between those who aren't oblivious (who didn't think he was a creep because they understood the code) and those are oblivious (who didn't think he was a creep because they were oblivious). So I suppose Henry\u2019s point about the people in the queue wasn\u2019t really valid.", "This actually makes a lot of sense, thank you for your insight! I was thinking let\u2019s do something other than dinner, but maybe the bar was a bit overstimulating.", "It doesn\u2019t really mean she fearful of him it\u2019s just a better safe then sorry thing, just a precaution because she\u2019s had a bad experience with these things before", "And again, we ask, how are we supposed to know? OP is obviously interested in Henry, and hasn\u2019t seen any flags (before tonight) that make her unwilling to continue getting to know him, but that doesn\u2019t mean she should automatically assume she can trust him implicitly. Trust takes time to build. \n\nI assume you\u2019ve heard the old \u201crule of thumb\u201d about guns - unless you personally know otherwise, treat every single gun you come across as if it is loaded and has the safety off. That\u2019s kind of how it is for us. Dangerous people don\u2019t have identifying physical features that make it easy to spot and stay away from them. Until we build trust, we have to take precautions so that we can continue having a good time.", "You just don't get it dude, you probably never will. You haven't lived as a woman.", "There is a big difference between \u201cafraid to be alone with him\u201d and \u201caware that some people will take advantage of a compromised or vulnerable situation, such as enclosing yourself in a small space with someone you don\u2019t know super well after you\u2019ve been drinking and when the other person may have some personal expectation of intimacy\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for feedback on my boundaries, they exist for many reasons and were communicated clearly from the jump. But thank you for so clearly displaying one of the reasons this boundary exists for a lot of people - unsafe individuals will use logic like this to try and guilt or wheedle someone into doing something they aren\u2019t comfortable with, instead of either saying \u201cthat\u2019s cool, we should both be comfortable with each step of how this relationship progresses\u201d or \u201cI respect your boundaries but don\u2019t think we\u2019re a good match\u201d.

Thank you.", "Someone else answered my initial question/thought. It took 3 dates for OP to see this guy\u2019s first red flag. \n\nI made the ignorant assumption that this guy would have shown that red flag earlier but I was wrong.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m not sure why then, as I and others have explained that I\u2019m not afraid of him, I just don\u2019t know him well enough to trust like that yet.

Doesn\u2019t mean she should disregard her boundaries when she clearly has them for a reason.", "You keep doing what you\u2019re doing. There\u2019s a reason the girl code exists.  Too many guys just do not get how vulnerable a woman can feel when dating.  And they don\u2019t understand that your very \u201ccasual\u201d assurance is what let these girls know that you felt ok in the present situation. If you had made a big deal about it, it would have seemed like you were sending up the red flares.  Loudly declaring the guy you\u2019re with is not a creep is almost like screaming out \u201cplease help me get outta this!\u201d  \n\nTo the previous commenter - Instead of wondering about someone\u2019s choices in men, how about being outraged that so many women have been taken advantage of in the dating world that they\u2019ve developed a girl code just to watch out for perfect strangers out in the wild.  Now that is fracking tragedy.", "There was a really obvious factor that I didn\u2019t consider from the beginning that someone pointed out to me, that this was the first red flag \u201cHenry\u201d had displayed during your three dates. \n\nI made the ignorant assumption that assholes are always assholes, and that this couldn\u2019t have been the first time he had done something like this. Which isn\u2019t the case. I apologize, I am sorry.", "You did stick up for him. You said everything is fine.", "NTA\n\nYour response *was* defending him.  You knew what Sarah was asking, she knew what you meant with your reply.  Any other onlookers who recognized the possibility that this could be what that interaction was would also have understood your reply.  You didn't need to make a speech.  Did he expect you to be confrontational with her?  To make a scene where none existed?", "NTA.  As a guy my response would have been 'It's really nice those girls were looking out for you'.   Because, it's really nice.", "NTA, I've had girls do similar for me and the guy I was with was actually really appreciative that girl code exists like that. Especially since it looked like he was doing something wrong (he wanted to dance close to me but I was too hot so asked him to move back and not hug me) \n\nThey say guilty ones are the ones who protest too much and make a big stink about it....", "Nta but given how present Sarah was, I think she was into you.", "NTA. We all know about the girl code. Angel shots, etc. It's unfortunate we live in this world but for every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction and it's dangerous out here for women. It really doesn't sound like you did anything to make him need standing up for but wait, so your fine getting in a car with a perfect stranger but not someone you've gone on 3 dates with? Either way, not the asshole.", "Henry....if you're here, please run as far away from this girl as you can! She is not good for you and will be a cancer in a long-term relationship. This was a red flag. Be smart now. To all the women who think this ok, I'm sure you're very toxic.", "i mean that was so obvious girls code i cant believe he didnt got that. its like bro code. you should always know the tell tale signs of that. like others said: he should think about hes actions that \"provoked\" that. not why you didnt stick up for him. which btw you did. you could have taken their offer and they would book him as creep for a whole cloud of women. NTA", "YTA. This indirect girl code bullshit is why men are always being called creeps. Go on a date with a girl? You're a creep apparently. Offer to give your date a ride? You're a creep. Get treated like a creep for no reason? Totally a creep. You should have been direct with \"Sarah\" and told her he was your date and that everything was fine. Now she's going to continue thinking every guy on Earth who dares step within 15 feet of a woman is a creep because neither of you know how to communicate directly.", "Honestly, I\u2019d be happy they looked out for my date. If some other guy was bothering her if I was preoccupied. \n\nHe does give the creep vibes. Just not the obvious type.", "He probably shouldn't take it personal either that you casually compare him to a serial killer? Just man up?", "If someone has to keep insisting that they're a 'good guy', they're most definitely not lol", "I don't know, I took my college roommate with me on my first date with my husband. And I straight up told him that it was in case anything happened to me she would be able to give a description of him and his car to the police. He didn't bat an eye. I returned the favor for my roommate when she went on her first date with a coworker. He didn't have a problem with it. At least not that he expressed to me or my roommate.", "Sometimes it's good to trust strangers' opinions, because they have no bias. \n\nThose girls heard what he was saying, knew that you were tipsy and thought that they had to jump in to save you. From their perspective he clearly was being a creep.\n\nThe fact that he got sooo defensive about it suggests that he also thought his actions were creepy/wrong, even if only subconsciously.", "yup.", "I did not compare him to a serial killer, I made a general observation that how people are perceived, and how they actually are, are two very different things. That strangers, even strangers whom you have spent 3 dates with, are careful and want to take things slow is not a reflection of who you are, usually it\u2019s more a reflection of who they are, or somebody else entirely.\n\nI think both you and OPs date would benefit immensely from taking things less personally. It\u2019s not a case of manning up either, it\u2019s not like the same does not apply for women. This is how it is to meet new people in general. People don\u2019t want to meet people who take insult over things not moving forward in their ideal pace. Don\u2019t make it so difficult to say no that people prefer not even being asked.", "I was already concerned about his pressuring you to let him drive you home but that fact just clinches it for me that he's a creep.\n\nMy husband and I were set up online (very devious matchmaking) by one of my college best friends who had been friends with him in High School. Since we were 4 hours apart, we chatted online for about a month and half and then he decided to come visit. Also note, he's a first responder.\n\nEven given that, I still took my roommate on the first part of our first date (dinner). And I straight up told him that I was bringing her so that if anything should happen to me, she'd be able to give a clear and detailed description of him and his vehicle to the police; it was before cell phones. He didn't bat an eye. \n\nSo yeah, any guy that's going to be upset about some women trying to look out for you is a dude I wouldn't trust."]}
