But maybe your comment could\u2019ve been my ex husband shouldn\u2019t be dating someone as young as you. Instead of telling her what to do. He\u2019s already expecting her to take care of his kids too and she has no clue what to do. Always gives me the ick when men can\u2019t date women their own age.", "NTA - Reddit is an interesting place. In the relationship sub redditors would say a man dating a woman with a big age gap is a red flag. \n\nYou were surprised so it didn't come out in a nice way but   I can understand being worried for her when there is such a gap. Your ex got so much more experience than her, I wonder if he would be happy if your daughter end up in an unbalanced relationship like this one?", "NTA. She was clearly uncomfortable with the duties bestowed upon her. Your ex is trying to make her a stepmother, when she hasn\u2019t even finished college. Could you have framed it differently? Sure. Did she try to do the right thing? Yes! But this will be a lot for her, and it will be a lot for your kids. Maybe next time have a talk with your ex, but I don\u2019t feel what you said was out of line. It won\u2019t change anything, but it\u2019s normal to be concerned for your kids, and for the young woman who did not know what she was getting into.", "NTA\n\nGod your ex is 42...yikessss\n\nYou should've kept it to yourself or said it to your ex\n\nAnd since she got so upset, she is clearly immature and unsure of herself otherwise she would just shut you down and laugh it off with your ex.", "NTA - weird af also he left your kids with her when you never met her.", "NTA. You're entitled to have and express opinions. Free country and all that.\n\nI'll concede she has a point that it's none of your business who she dates.\n\nBut it's certainly your business to be concerned about your children and what goes on in the home they are living in. If Katie posted here, nearly everyone would tell her to run far, far away from the creepy 42M with kids who is using her as a live-in nanny. You have every right to be concerned about the impact their relationship will have on your kids' perception of what normal, healthy relationships look like.", "NTA - and who was going to stay with the kids, if your son wasn't sick? Was she going to school and leave them alone??", "Go the the stepparents sub. All you'll see there are young 20-something women trapped with a significantly older guy with kids from a previous relationship. NTA.", "Going against the grain here to point out that it is OP's business in so far as she had to leave work because her ex is not caring for his kids well.  The ex left the kids with someone who said \"she did not know what to do\".  If her ex and the new gf were capable, then they should be able to manage a sick child as if OP were not in the picture.  What should you do?  Do whatever you would do if I were dead. Of course, OP is not going to respond that way because she loves her child, but if ex and gf (or whoever ex puts in charge of looking after their kids) is incapable of looking after them, then this means OP can no longer rely on ex to be a responsible parent.  Responsibility is not necessarily related to age -- after all, many people become parents at 23.  But the 23 year old gf does not seem mature enough if she called OP in a panic over a fever.\n\nOP should apologize to gf & ex over age comment and instead talk to ex about him putting a plan in place to help gf (for example, giving gf doctor info or ability to contact him in an emergency) so that ex is not put in a difficult position in the future.  OP needs to pose this as, What would have happened if gf could not reach OP either?  Not fair to gf or kids.", "NTA \n\nYou were right. Maybe you could have worded it better, or maybe it's none of your business, but you were right. In a few years time they will break up and you will receive another tearful phonecall from her saying how you were always right. Because age gap relationships (especially she being so young) are never normal, and there's always some abuse going on.

This poor girl is less at fault than the ex, and whilst you're probably right, giving her your unasked for opinion and advice isn't likely to endear you to her, and isn't really fair on her, when it's your ex who is at fault here.", "NTA\nYou dropped some wisdom on her, she was too young to understand. \n\nThe only reason she\u2019s upset is she knows in her heart it\u2019s true.", "NTA.

I'm older than both of you and would call the childs parent with a high fever.", "Obviously the answer here is you should go down to the local college\u2019s boys wrestling team and pick yourself up a new hunk who\u2019s into cougars. Then bring him by the house when you go apologize.", "NAH.  You and the gf both did thr best you could under the circumstances.  The only red ink in your book is that (I think) you shouldn't have brought up the age issue at that time and place.  I just don't think the AH judgement fits anyone here based on what we know.", "NTA.\n\nGlad she called you.\n\nShe knows somethings fishy here too, she just didn't want to hear it.", "YTA. When you had your first child and they got sick, did you immediately know what to do, or did you worry and get nervous? That is the equivalent of what his gf did, and she did the responsible thing by calling you, not her own mom, which would have been easier for her probably.\n\nShe reached out to you because you're her parent regardless of how awkward it might have been (hence, nervous), invited you into their home, and at the first chance, you made it awkward. Now, you've possibly closed the line of communication with her and she'll likely not go to you when she needs help with your children.\n\nWas it worth it to unload on her? It wasn't in your kids' best interests. Do you think your comment helped your relationship with your ex-husband? It doesn't sound like it.", "YTA BUT if it was a friend, yes, I would point out a major age difference like this IS a red flag. I have seen post here that age differences get red flagged all the time. The difference here is, you aren\u2019t her friend and it wasn\u2019t your place. You sounded kind of creepy and bitter and condescending. You said she was a nice person and seemed genuinely concerned about your child. I am sure she was nervous. You didn\u2019t help matters.", "YTA\n\nFirst, for making assumptions about her age and competence, based on how she looks.\n\nSecond, because she acted completely correctly.  She is not your child's parent, she has neither the right nor the responsibility to provide medical care to your child.  She first tried to contact the child's father, because it was his time for custody, and then she contacted you, as the other guardian parent. \n\nIf a conversation is needed, it is not about how young she is, or looks.  It needs to be a conversation with your ex about him leaving your child alone with someone unrelated and without the right to authorize care, and then being out of contact, during the time when he (not the girlfriend!) is responsible for caring for your child.  \n\nThat phone needs to stay on, even during an important meeting, when your ex is responsible for your child's care but another person is providing care, so that he can deal with emergencies.", "YTA. \n\n>I just couldn't stop myself\n\nYes you could.\n\n>I was just mentioning a fact.\n\nNo, you were giving an opinion.", "YTA. Saying she was too young was your *opinion,* not a fact. You and your ex are divorced; you have no say over the age of the person he dates. What's more, she clearly tried to do the responsible thing by calling you when she didn't know what to do with a sick child.", "Slightly YTA if only because she's right in you can't be telling her who to date. If anything, you should be on your ex about it, but even then, you somewhat gave up the right to tell him how to run his life, too.\n\n\nSo far the only issue I've seen is this woman didn't know how to handle a high fever, which isn't any more weird than a first time mom of 23.", "YTA\n\nYour comment and your phrasing was inappropriate. It came across as judgy rather than concerned.\n\nIf you are concerned about your kids then you should say so. If you are concerned about her well being then you should respectfully communicate that concern to her. \n\nThe way you phrased it did not communicate either concern for your kids nor concern for her. It just sounded like a critique.\n\nThat being said your ex is a bit creepy. A 19 year age difference is huge, and he would have started dating her when she was 22.", "YTA for interfering with your ex's relationship, but ... who was going to be watching your kids while the girl went to classes for a couple of hours?!? THAT *is* your business. A 9 and 7 year old should not be left alone for several hours. I'd be much more concerned about that!", "YTA...of course she was nervous around you, her age has nothing to do with being able to care for children, many of us have parents who were in their 20's when they had us, and it is none of your business who she dates. You had a great oppotunity to put her at eases and show her what to do should your children get sick again while they are with your husband, BTW the word asshole is a bit harsh here, but you came damn close to being one.", "YTA. Her age is a fact, but the judgment that she's too young to be dating your ex is an opinion. And if they're planning to move in together, she'll be spending a lot more time with your kids. Keep your opinions on this to yourself; as you've already seen you just stirred up some unnecessary drama.", "ESH (except the GF). You\u2019re TA for telling the GF she\u2019s too young to date your ex\u2014 she\u2019s right, you don\u2019t know her or her circumstances at all. Not your place to judge their relationship. BUT, your ex is also TA for leaving her alone with your kids (and presumably not telling you and then also putting his phone on DND while she\u2019s home alone with two young kids?!). What\u2019s important here isn\u2019t the age of your ex\u2019s new gf it\u2019s the best interests and health of your kids. You should have a conversation with your ex about how you\u2019re uncomfortable with the kids being left with gf/not being informed about health concerns as I assume that the 9y/o was in school/should have gone to school so likely he knew that he had a fever and didn\u2019t tell you (also you let her kick you out when your kid was sick?!) and figure out how your parenting plan is going to work going forward so your kid isn\u2019t left in a potentially dangerous situation with someone who is clearly not familiar with childcare. It sounds like both you and your ex are checked out from parenting these kids (especially if you knew he was leaving them alone with someone you\u2019d never met) and honestly they\u2019re going to be the ones that suffer.", "YTA \n\nfor the comment on her age and her relationship \n\nbut, if she\u2019s nervous and uncomfortable taking care of your kids and you\u2019re not okay with that, it\u2019s fair to raise concern with your husband on wether she should be watching them alone at this time. by the way, if she was going to class that day and your husband was at work, who was going to be watching the kid?", "I\u2019m sorry, what the hell? Your ex-husband left your kids with his new girlfriend. She may be a lovely person but she\u2019s obviously not prepared to take care of TWO kids on her own. AND she was leaving for classes? What was the plan, exactly? Were the kids supposed to take care of themselves for several hours? I\u2019d worry less about the age gap and more about whatever the hell was going on there.\n\nNTA, btw. Katie is very confident in her judgement while having no idea how to handle a fever situation. (I mean I\u2019d still call you because I\u2019d be nervous to give medicine to a child without his parents\u2019s verbal consent, he may have allergies or something, but she specifically said she doesn\u2019t know what to do at all.) I don\u2019t think she\u2019s equipped to be in a relationship with kids involved and I sincerely hope it\u2019s not about to bite her.", "NTA, your ex is gross.", "YTA:   \nnone of your business who she, or your ex dates.   \n\n\nI dont think she really did anything wrong in the situation.  She got beyond what she felt like she could handle, and called in help.  Seems reasonable to me.", "LOL\n\nYTA \n\nFunny \nShe is too young\nBut also you\u2019re old enough to know better", "Very very light YTA here, it\u2019s really really rude to comment on someone\u2019s age like that. It\u2019s especially rude to presume to tell someone what to do with their life in their own house. \nI get you were surprised and I\u2019m not saying you are wrong about the age gap, but picking a fight with your ex\u2019s live-in partner about their relationship with your ex is not a move that\u2019s going to end well.", "EHS - OK, it's kinda gross, but it's not illegal for your husband to be dating someone that young... probably should have talked to your ex about it first.\n\nBUT he is TA for leaving your kids in the care of a 19 year old that has other commitments... if he wasn't around and she needed to leave for college, what would they have done?  Just left a 7 and 9 year old to fend for themselves?  This is not a safe place for your kids as she clearly doesn't have the maturity or experience to care for them.", "YTA it really isn\u2019t any of your business how old she is or who she\u2019s dating, and it was rude of you to say that. Did you really think she would say \u201coh wow, my boyfriend\u2019s ex wife thinks I\u2019m too young to be dating my boyfriend, I should definitely listen to her unsolicited opinion!\u201d\n\nYou should probably be more appreciative that your kids have a kind and caring potential stepmom.", "YTA, and incredibly judgemental. It's not your place to say what she is too young for, your ex knows her and obviously trusts her with the children, she did everything right in the situation she was in so I don't see why you have any issues with this.", "YTA \n\nIt's none of your business and not your place to comment to her.", "YTA\n\nWhat two consenting adults do is none of your business.  At all.  This girl called you, to help your son.  Because she was concerned for him.  Then you had to get all high and mighty about the age gap.  Shame on you.", "YTA.  If you have concerns, you bring them up to your ex in private.  That was a crappy thing for you to do.", "YTA.  Not your business as long as she treats the kids well.  Butt out.", "[deleted]", "ESH - you only mildly, though. I would have discussed with your ex, not with her. Meaning, I would have discussed both leaving the kids alone with her, as well as the age discrepancy. It isn't her fault he's being creepy, and she did the right thing in calling you - you'd want her to do that again in the future if they stay together, I assume?", "YTA for judging who she should and should not be dating. Everything else is inconsequential to the discussion here.", "YTA. Your ex dating a fellow consenting adult, and she is an adult, is none of your business. If you had an issue with her inexperience caring for children that would be understandable, but you went directly for her age.", "YTA. They are both adults and can do as they please. You are divorced and no longer have any right to micromanage his personal life - and zero rights to micromanage hers. You did not come from a place of 'concern' about her well-being, you came from a place of judgement - which neither of them asked you for. Keep your personal attacks to yourself.", "Are you REALLY so obtuse?  You told your ex's new love interest she was not appropriate for him.       YTA.", "YTA.", "yta. i agree that someone as young as her shouldn't be dating someone as old as your ex (power imbalance and him possibly being only a handful of years younger than her own parents) but nothing in this situation really warranted you saying that", "YTA You should be happy that she\u2019s a kind and caring person that your children will be around. And she wasn\u2019t too proud to call you and let you know your son needed you and that she wasn\u2019t sure what to do. You could\u2019ve taken this and built a great relationship with her since she\u2019s going to be in your children\u2019s lives, but now she may not feel comfortable calling you next time something comes up because she doesn\u2019t want to listen to your judgements about her life.", "YTA - Stating she is too young to date someone who is twice her age was not necessary or factual. How are you not an ahole?", "YTA- are you wrong, no. Was it your place to say it? No. \n\nTheres no way you can say anything Negative about their relationship without seeming like a bitter ex.\n\nBest thing you can do now is apologize. Say \"I'm sorry. That was an inappropriate thing for me to say. I reacted out of concern for both you and my children, but you are an adult and it was disrespectful to judge you based on your age\"", "YTA, while I personally agree she is too young for him she is still an adult and her partners ex telling her she is too young is not accomplishing anything productive. She treats your kids well and knows when she is in over her head so no danger there so not really your place.", "I agree with you here about the age gap, but YTA for mentioning it to her. You guys are divorced, keep all comments about his partners either to yourself or share with your own friends/family where he and the kids won\u2019t hear anything.

Hell I bet you couldn't even state it coherently.\n\n I can say *you* do have an adenda and that is to judge other people unfairly, perhaps you were judged unfairly as a kid...IDK but to suggest that all relationships in which the man is older than woman, and that age gap is not what you consider normal, are abusive without some sort of documentation to support it is irresponsible. FYI, I was marreid for 22 years to a woman was 3 years older than me and have always preferred woman my own age.", "Aren\u2019t you the one who said always abuse?

I really wanted to believe you weren\u2019t an AH but here you are blaming a 23 year old girl for \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of your creepy, but in your words handsome and rich ex husband. And to go after her looks? I thought she was the 23 year old nor you", "I\u2019m actually surprised you\u2019re as cool as you are about some person you know almost nothing about being involved in taking care of your kids. You must be on really excellent terms with your ex and have a great deal of trust regarding co-parenting. My kids are grown but if I had been in that situation I would have wanted to know as much as possible about anyone being in close contact with my child. Then again, I\u2019m the type of person who google searches and background checks potential dates so I might just be wired differently.", "We are on excellent terms. we have always been friends he was planning to introduce us to each other soon\n\nI trust him", "I\u2019m more concerned about the fact that he had someone move in with him and the kids but you two had never even met.", "YTA. Take it up with the husband, not the girl. Who are you to decide who she wants to date?", "I\u2019d go with YTA. I am older than the ex and can\u2019t imagine dating someone half my age. Seems messed up no doubt. But you don\u2019t talk to someone for a few minutes and tell them their relationship is trash. I assume if problems arise in the further OP shouldn\u2019t expect a call, to the possible detriment of the kids", "NTA\n\nThey are almost 20 years apart... He could be her father", "Okay, so NTA, but I do think it's important to point out that it probably wasn't the best idea to bring this up to her when she was actually doing something pretty responsible for your son. He was sick, she was uncertain what to do, but ultimately she did the right thing by calling you because this was in the best interest of your son. This is no small thing, and totally shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nYour reasoning that she's young and this is a lot for her is totally valid, but I understand her getting upset at the fact that you brought this up. Try to imagine how it felt from her perspective. She probably feels like she met this great guy and is happy with him, etc., and his ex-wife is now telling her she shouldn't be dating him. I'm not at all surprised she was upset by the remark.\n\nMoving forward, maybe you could apologize and thank her for taking care of your son and calling you when he was sick. Again, really nice thing for her to have done. She could have just let your son suffer, but she didn't. It's got to be hard to call your boyfriend's ex-wife and ask for help, but she did it because she was concerned for your son.  \n\nI don't think it would be a bad idea if you talked to your ex-husband candidly about your concerns. It is a lot of responsibility to put on someone who is so young, and he's making her take on some pretty significant responsibilities to care for your children. I also feel like he bears a lot more responsibility than the twenty three year old for this relationship. He's older, more experienced, and depending on how you view this situation, is potentially taking advantage of a much younger person. I feel like this is especially possible if they've only been dating a year and he's moved her in and made her responsible for childcare at times.", "YTA, but your husband is the bigger AH.   The scenario she faced is that your child was sick, and the father was unavailable.    She acted exactly as she should have.   She called you, which could not have been easy, but she put the child\u2019s welfare first.   You then told her to leave, so she did.   She even brought soup when she returned.   Your children say she is nice.    How would you have preferred she handle it? \nHer age here has no relevance with what happened.   It is appropriate to talk to your ex privately about some concerns you may have, but to talk down to her in the moment was not appropriate imo.", "YTA.  There are two kinds of \"mentioning facts.\"  I can say that the person who invented roller skates wore them to a party in 1790, skated through a ballroom while playing a violin, but had neglected to invent steering or brakes and smashed right into a mirror, injuring himself and breaking both the mirror and the violin.  When I do that kind of \"mentioning facts\", I am not an asshole, unless maybe I am at a convention of John Jacob Merlin fans, in which case I would only be the asshole because everybody already knew that already.\n\nBut \"mentioning facts\" the sense of \"you are too young to be dating my ex\" is an asshole move.\n\nNote also that you said \"I just couldn't stop myself.\"  So you know perfectly well that you ought to have done so.", "I believe the son would have gone to school had he not been sick. I also believe the OP is the AH here for bringing up the age to the clearly uncomfortable girlfriend. OP mentions multiple times the girlfriend seems nervous, probably from meeting OP for the first time unexpectedly and without her partner. OP should have brought the age issue up to ex husband, which h I believe is a valid concern of the OP. I also find it odd that after dating for a year OP and husband haven\u2019t found it necessary to introduce the girlfriend.", "Of course she was unsure and nervous. Everyone could predict you would judge the age gap. But I dont think she did anything wrong. She didnt send your son sick to school, she didnt call some unresponsible stranger to look after him and did not leave him alone. She was mature enough to call the parents of the sick kid. Then she came with soup and fruit, that shows she is trying to do it as best as she can with (maybe) zero experience. \n\nImo YTA just because you attacked her with your opinion when you could talk about the matter with your ex.", "YTA.\n\nI mean, yeah I guess the age gap is a little... off? But it's not like she's a minor, or even close. She's in her mid-20's.\n\nIn any case you had no business hassling the poor ~~girl~~ woman about it, especially in a stressful situation like that. She can't help her age, and she's absolutely right that it's none of your business.\n\nYou're allowed your opinions, but you very much should have kept that one to yourself.\n\nETA: I will say that there are some other potential concerns you seem to have completely missed in your flutter over her age:\n\n* Your ex left someone inexperienced and ill-equipped to handle a crisis in charge of your kids.\n* Who was supposed to be watching them while she went to class if the son wasn't sick? Please tell me they weren't about to be left home alone...", "YTA.  She's an adult and can do as she pleases.  Furthermore, people younger than her have kids of their own all the time.

His ex's rule was that if either of them were to meet someone new, they were not allowed to introduce them to the kids until the relationship was at least a year old so they knew it was \"serious\". We respected the shit out of that agreement. I first met the children exactly a year after him and I started dating and we did several activities together before we even contemplated moving in together. I even met the mom so she would know who her children would be with and it was clear that, although I didn't have children of my own (I physically cannot which in a fucked up way makes people less likely to judge me for not having any kids but I digress) I had spent my entire teenagerhood (12 to 18) babysitting all the kids of my neighborhood as I was the only teenager and working in summer camps in the summers so I was actually really well versed in child care. My husband's ex has never had to worry about my interactions with her children or my taking care of them if they are sick and whatnot (and their dad is completely involved, I am simply allowed to have a parental role with the kids) because she knows me and I made sure that she could trust me (I've had several step parents growing up and some of them were of the evil variety so I know what not to do).

Or are you saying the only correct solution here was for her to miss her class in order to not bother the child\u2019s mom with the inconvenience of her sick child?\n\nAnd you\u2019re living in a fantasy world if you think women in his age bracket could magically get him to change and become a decent father.", "Jealousy?", "Forget the age difference: this is why she needs to DTMFA.", "Very soft YTA. You may be right, but she is an adult who you do not know. Who she dates really isn't up for you to decide or comment on, and she had every right to get annoyed at you.", "Yes YTAH. No point in stating the obvious.  It will only make it more difficult to co-parent with your ex.", "Her ex shouldn\u2019t be involved with someone so young, nor should he be leaving his kids with her. Especially since she has no clue how to care for them. He is a perv/predator. \n\nPersonally, I truly doubt I would have waited to find out who is actively involved in my children\u2019s lives to the point she lives with them and cares for them regularly. At least once it got to that point, I would have required to know who is living with my kids, and not after the fact.", "This if he chooses to date a younger person I guess that\u2019s his business but to leave his kids with a person who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and be unreachable on top he\u2019s tah", "Reddit can\u2019t make up its collective mind", "Exactly. I\u2019m only 30 and I wouldn\u2019t date a 23 year old. Sooooo much happens over those years just between 25 - 30. This dude is gross.", "She is 23 and perfectly capable of making her own decisions. Maybe we should raise the minimum age to join the army to 25 or 30 to make you happy since (according to you) these grown ass adults can't seem to think for themselves. \n\nIt's none of OPs business who her husband dates and it's none of her business who this 23 year old woman wants to date.", "Wtf do they even have in common?! She can talk about her class that day while he talks about his meetings? They aren't even on the same level \ud83d\ude02", "I have a friend (25 at the time) that was dating someone 45 who had a kid that just turned 18. Both the bf and kid would be invited to our group\u2019s hangouts and I was always weirded out by it", "It\u2019s not a fact that he\u2019s too old for her.  Where is the cutoff?   I think he\u2019s too old yes, but technically and legally, he isn\u2019t.", "Absolutely. This girl was already terrified and meeting the ex for the first time in uncomfortable circumstances where she had to admit she was in over her head, the last thing she needed at that moment is said ex invalidating her relationship and infantilizing her. That\u2019t the kind of advice she needs to hear from a trusted friend or family member, not a stranger who probably already intimidates her.\n\nNow, the ex definitely deserves an ear full, both for dating someone half his age and for leaving his kids in the care of someone completely unequipped to deal with emergencies.", "100% all of this", "Wasn\u2019t calling mom a competent move though? What do you think the teenage neighborhood babysitter would have done differently?", "Many times I've seen parents bring their kids to class. They sit in the back and play on a tablet. We had an outdoor class once and the professor bought the kid an ice cream.", "Facts. Address this in courts", "Are you guys crazy, it seems like the husband was supposed to be there and he\u2019s the one dropping the ball with his kid, probably in a meeting later than he should. He\u2019s taking advantage of his young gf for childcare. And a girl still in college is going out of her way to take care of kids that aren\u2019t hers and being soup with I\u2019m assuming her own money. Get a grip on reality. \nThe wife is major YTA, the new gf, who you\u2019re definitely jealous of, is none of your business her age and why she\u2019s dating your husband. Your only concern is her involvement in your kids life. Which it sounds like she was handling VERY well for her age by calling you when she realized you\u2019d be better suited to take care of the kid.", "If it's a day where both OP and her ex are at work (and the gf is taking college classes), it's probably a school day for a nine year old. I assume he woke up ill and was kept home at a time he would normally be at school.", "Right!\n\nApparently alone\u2026and the poor baby is only 9 y/o.", "The kid would probably be in school if he weren\u2019t sick. The other one probably was at school from what it sounds like. She called the mom because she didn\u2019t know what to do and didn\u2019t want to miss class. I don\u2019t see anything implying that she leaves them alone regularly.", "I was going to say THIS RIGHT HERE. If son hadn't been sick....does OP's ex leave his kids in the care of his college-age GF, who leaves them alone when she goes to class? THAT IS CHILD ENDANGERMENT and I would be contacting my divorce lawyer to adjust the custody agreement. you don't leave two children under the age of 10 alone. what the fuck?\n\nliterally unrelated to the ex husband dating a girl who is a certain age - the ex husband is leaving the children ALONE during his custody time. Nah.", "school man. school. wtf", "Similarly, how would he feel if he showed up at your house and your kids were being watched by your 23 year old boyfriend?", "you guys are so full of it. No mother want's their ex's new gf who has never raised a child of her own winging it with a potentially serious unexpected medical situation. Calling the childs mother when she couldn't get a hold of the dad was ABSOLUTELY the correct play for a smart mature adult. Even if she had raised 5 kids of her own, it was probably STILL the right play to call the actual mother before medicating or taking a child to the hospital.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 43 and if I was taking care of even a blood related niece or nephew showed up with a bad fever I'd call the parents if the child presented concerning medical symptoms like a bad fever. I'm not even going to give the kid tylenol without a parent instruction. I don't know what they are allergic to or what the parent prefers.", "what a bullshit take. People leave a 9 year old with a 16 year old baby sitter all the time. Say what you wanna say and stop the nonsense.", "It's more that too many people don't actually understand what grooming is, which has gotten worse in the current climate.", "Seriously. I also can't believe that no one has pointed out that the vast majority of babysitters are teenagers. This gf has 8-9 years on most of the kids that people entrust their children with every Friday and Saturday night since forever. The ex-wife isn't concerned about her kids' wellbeing. She's just acting like a jealous ex and wants validation from Reddit. Which she seems to be getting in droves. Sad.", "Y'all do remember that college classes can be taken after 2pm? He could've gone home from school and gotten sick. We don't really know their life schedule.\n\n\nThough if the time was mentioning in the post, my bad, i can't read", "Even if you bring a child to daycare, once there is a fever they call mom or dad. Are they too young?", "You think he just fell hopelessly in love with a college student because of her personality?", "I can\u2019t fault her because she did what she was supposed to\u2014called the parents until a capable adult could come. It\u2019s possible she would\u2019ve just stayed there if she hadn\u2019t gotten a hold of OP", "I don't have kids. But it seems incredibly questionable that this guy moved his new partner in without the mother of his kids ever meeting or knowing anything about them. I mean I wouldn't expect more from a guy dating a girl who could pass as his daughter. But did OP also never think to meet the person living with her kids half of the month?", "This was my thought. When OP turned up of course the GF would go to class/work! Why would she sit at home all day with her partner\u2019s ex?!", "I was with you until you said it was absolutely none of OP's business who her ex dates. If it were just dating, that would be true. But it is her business who lives with her children, and both OP and the ex should have realized this and set up a meeting \\*before\\* this woman moved in. At this point, however, she seems nice, and she did the right thing calling OP, and she is old enough to make her own romantic mistakes, so it is a bit late for OP to object to her based on age.", "This kind of implies she is not a capable adult. And while I don't think she's TA I think the ex husband CERTAINLY is.", "Best response I've read so far.", "I'm a stickler for details. He's 42, the girlfriend is 23, she just looks 19. He would have to be 47 to be more than twice her age.", "I really don't fault the 23 y.o.  It's the dad who went off and left his sick child behind.  If a child is sick enough to stay home from school, you generally know that before it's time for you to leave for work.", "Same, 24 and that is a major long-term LIFE commitment. If they\u2019ve moved in together and the kids are staying over there sometimes, the kids de more likely to get attached and if it doesn\u2019t work out, it\u2019s gonna be hard on them.", "It is OP\u2019s business if she\u2019s going to be a part of her kids\u2019 lives. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s *choice*, but it is her business.", "Old enough, sure, but it doesn\u2019t make the decision any smarter.", " Sure. And I can still make dump decisions even if I am much older.  I wouldn't mind if it was a short sexual relationship. But deciding to live in together shows lack of care from the father to his children, and  a bit sad that she is. choosing a 40yo  father of two kids.", "I think they are more so referring to the issue that she didn't seem to know what to do in order to take care of a child with a high fever.", "An older woman showing concern isn\u2019t \u201cberating and insulting\u201d. Could it have been a little tactless? Sure, okay. But let\u2019s not pretend this was the verbal assault you\u2019re portraying this as.", "I think she called because she didn't know how to care for the child, AND because she was late for college.", "Thank you for making sense.", "I'm also 48, and wholeheartedly agree. That's why I'm marrying a 40 yo man with no children. \ud83d\ude06", "68 and still too young for that lmao. OP is NTA even though it wasn't her business to say that. I wouldn't have been able to restrain myself either lmao. Id've taken the kids back to my place though, not stayed there. Too much to hope for when 40 something ex wife meets 23 year old GF under those circumstances. 23 is old enough to be able to take care of a sick child, GF just didn't want to and didn't feel it was her responsiblity but didn't want to be an AH by bringing that up lol.", "Never ever give a child medication without getting permission of the parents/guardians first. The reason any decent parent leaves contact numbers for babysitters is so that they can get ahold of the people who can actually make the decisions before taking these kinds of steps. Or they leave a list of instructions for what they can do if the child gets sick. Calling the mom was the right thing to do when she couldn't get ahold of dad.", "And when she takes the kid to hospital and they can\u2019t do anything because she\u2019s not allowed to make medical calls for the kid and the mom needs to be called anyway, and you think it\u2019s appropriate to give other peoples kids medication and not inform them?", "Made a clear, logical statement? That's a paddlin'.", "Yeah. He was meant to be in school, but the way the story is told it sounds like she was going to class, regardless, so a kid would still have been left unattended? Unless I missed something.", "Because she\u2019s not the mother and she kicked the kids mother out. She\u2019s the insecure one."]}
