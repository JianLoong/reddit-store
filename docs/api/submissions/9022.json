What is it? \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d be pissed my ex left my kids with someone not equipped to care for them.", "Maybe unpopular but NTA 23 and dating a man who\u2019s 42??? With two kids.

But maybe your comment could\u2019ve been my ex husband shouldn\u2019t be dating someone as young as you. Instead of telling her what to do. He\u2019s already expecting her to take care of his kids too and she has no clue what to do. Always gives me the ick when men can\u2019t date women their own age.", "NTA - Reddit is an interesting place. In the relationship sub redditors would say a man dating a woman with a big age gap is a red flag. \n\nYou were surprised so it didn't come out in a nice way but   I can understand being worried for her when there is such a gap. Your ex got so much more experience than her, I wonder if he would be happy if your daughter end up in an unbalanced relationship like this one?", "NTA. She was clearly uncomfortable with the duties bestowed upon her. Your ex is trying to make her a stepmother, when she hasn\u2019t even finished college. Could you have framed it differently? Sure. Did she try to do the right thing? Yes! But this will be a lot for her, and it will be a lot for your kids. Maybe next time have a talk with your ex, but I don\u2019t feel what you said was out of line. It won\u2019t change anything, but it\u2019s normal to be concerned for your kids, and for the young woman who did not know what she was getting into.", "NTA\n\nGod your ex is 42...yikessss\n\nYou should've kept it to yourself or said it to your ex\n\nAnd since she got so upset, she is clearly immature and unsure of herself otherwise she would just shut you down and laugh it off with your ex.", "NTA - weird af also he left your kids with her when you never met her.", "NTA. You're entitled to have and express opinions. Free country and all that.\n\nI'll concede she has a point that it's none of your business who she dates.\n\nBut it's certainly your business to be concerned about your children and what goes on in the home they are living in. If Katie posted here, nearly everyone would tell her to run far, far away from the creepy 42M with kids who is using her as a live-in nanny. You have every right to be concerned about the impact their relationship will have on your kids' perception of what normal, healthy relationships look like.", "NTA - and who was going to stay with the kids, if your son wasn't sick? Was she going to school and leave them alone??", "Go the the stepparents sub. All you'll see there are young 20-something women trapped with a significantly older guy with kids from a previous relationship. NTA.", "Going against the grain here to point out that it is OP's business in so far as she had to leave work because her ex is not caring for his kids well.  The ex left the kids with someone who said \"she did not know what to do\".  If her ex and the new gf were capable, then they should be able to manage a sick child as if OP were not in the picture.  What should you do?  Do whatever you would do if I were dead. Of course, OP is not going to respond that way because she loves her child, but if ex and gf (or whoever ex puts in charge of looking after their kids) is incapable of looking after them, then this means OP can no longer rely on ex to be a responsible parent.  Responsibility is not necessarily related to age -- after all, many people become parents at 23.  But the 23 year old gf does not seem mature enough if she called OP in a panic over a fever.\n\nOP should apologize to gf & ex over age comment and instead talk to ex about him putting a plan in place to help gf (for example, giving gf doctor info or ability to contact him in an emergency) so that ex is not put in a difficult position in the future.  OP needs to pose this as, What would have happened if gf could not reach OP either?  Not fair to gf or kids.", "NTA \n\nYou were right. Maybe you could have worded it better, or maybe it's none of your business, but you were right. In a few years time they will break up and you will receive another tearful phonecall from her saying how you were always right. Because age gap relationships (especially she being so young) are never normal, and there's always some abuse going on. Sometimes people just need some tough love.", "NTA facts are facts, she\u2019s upset cause she knows it\u2019s true", "NTA, while not your business, it was true", "I'm going with nta but frankly, you should have spoken to your ex about his tastes, and the fact he left your kids in the care of someone who isn't equipped to look after them (at least yet). This poor girl is less at fault than the ex, and whilst you're probably right, giving her your unasked for opinion and advice isn't likely to endear you to her, and isn't really fair on her, when it's your ex who is at fault here.", "NTA\nYou dropped some wisdom on her, she was too young to understand. \n\nThe only reason she\u2019s upset is she knows in her heart it\u2019s true.", "NTA.

I'm older than both of you and would call the childs parent with a high fever.", "Obviously the answer here is you should go down to the local college\u2019s boys wrestling team and pick yourself up a new hunk who\u2019s into cougars. Then bring him by the house when you go apologize.", "NAH.  You and the gf both did thr best you could under the circumstances.  The only red ink in your book is that (I think) you shouldn't have brought up the age issue at that time and place.  I just don't think the AH judgement fits anyone here based on what we know.", "NTA.\n\nGlad she called you.\n\nShe knows somethings fishy here too, she just didn't want to hear it.", "YTA. When you had your first child and they got sick, did you immediately know what to do, or did you worry and get nervous? That is the equivalent of what his gf did, and she did the responsible thing by calling you, not her own mom, which would have been easier for her probably.\n\nShe reached out to you because you're her parent regardless of how awkward it might have been (hence, nervous), invited you into their home, and at the first chance, you made it awkward. Now, you've possibly closed the line of communication with her and she'll likely not go to you when she needs help with your children.\n\nWas it worth it to unload on her? It wasn't in your kids' best interests. Do you think your comment helped your relationship with your ex-husband? It doesn't sound like it.", "YTA BUT if it was a friend, yes, I would point out a major age difference like this IS a red flag. I have seen post here that age differences get red flagged all the time. The difference here is, you aren\u2019t her friend and it wasn\u2019t your place. You sounded kind of creepy and bitter and condescending. You said she was a nice person and seemed genuinely concerned about your child. I am sure she was nervous. You didn\u2019t help matters.", "YTA\n\nFirst, for making assumptions about her age and competence, based on how she looks.\n\nSecond, because she acted completely correctly.  She is not your child's parent, she has neither the right nor the responsibility to provide medical care to your child.  She first tried to contact the child's father, because it was his time for custody, and then she contacted you, as the other guardian parent. \n\nIf a conversation is needed, it is not about how young she is, or looks.  It needs to be a conversation with your ex about him leaving your child alone with someone unrelated and without the right to authorize care, and then being out of contact, during the time when he (not the girlfriend!) is responsible for caring for your child.  \n\nThat phone needs to stay on, even during an important meeting, when your ex is responsible for your child's care but another person is providing care, so that he can deal with emergencies.", "YTA. \n\n>I just couldn't stop myself\n\nYes you could.\n\n>I was just mentioning a fact.\n\nNo, you were giving an opinion.", "YTA. Saying she was too young was your *opinion,* not a fact. You and your ex are divorced; you have no say over the age of the person he dates. What's more, she clearly tried to do the responsible thing by calling you when she didn't know what to do with a sick child.", "Slightly YTA if only because she's right in you can't be telling her who to date. If anything, you should be on your ex about it, but even then, you somewhat gave up the right to tell him how to run his life, too.\n\n\nSo far the only issue I've seen is this woman didn't know how to handle a high fever, which isn't any more weird than a first time mom of 23.", "YTA\n\nYour comment and your phrasing was inappropriate. It came across as judgy rather than concerned.\n\nThat being said your ex seems a bit creepy. A 19 year age difference is huge, and he would have started dating her when she was 22. That is basically just out of college.", "YTA for interfering with your ex's relationship, but ... who was going to be watching your kids while the girl went to classes for a couple of hours?!? THAT *is* your business. A 9 and 7 year old should not be left alone for several hours. I'd be much more concerned about that!", "YTA...of course she was nervous around you, her age has nothing to do with being able to care for children, many of us have parents who were in their 20's when they had us, and it is none of your business who she dates. You had a great oppotunity to put her at eases and show her what to do should your children get sick again while they are with your husband, BTW the word asshole is a bit harsh here, but you came damn close to being one.", "YTA. Her age is a fact, but the judgment that she's too young to be dating your ex is an opinion. And if they're planning to move in together, she'll be spending a lot more time with your kids. Keep your opinions on this to yourself; as you've already seen you just stirred up some unnecessary drama.", "ESH (except the GF). You\u2019re TA for telling the GF she\u2019s too young to date your ex\u2014 she\u2019s right, you don\u2019t know her or her circumstances at all. Not your place to judge their relationship. BUT, your ex is also TA for leaving her alone with your kids (and presumably not telling you and then also putting his phone on DND while she\u2019s home alone with two young kids?!). What\u2019s important here isn\u2019t the age of your ex\u2019s new gf it\u2019s the best interests and health of your kids. You should have a conversation with your ex about how you\u2019re uncomfortable with the kids being left with gf/not being informed about health concerns as I assume that the 9y/o was in school/should have gone to school so likely he knew that he had a fever and didn\u2019t tell you (also you let her kick you out when your kid was sick?!) and figure out how your parenting plan is going to work going forward so your kid isn\u2019t left in a potentially dangerous situation with someone who is clearly not familiar with childcare. It sounds like both you and your ex are checked out from parenting these kids (especially if you knew he was leaving them alone with someone you\u2019d never met) and honestly they\u2019re going to be the ones that suffer.", "YTA \n\nfor the comment on her age and her relationship \n\nbut, if she\u2019s nervous and uncomfortable taking care of your kids and you\u2019re not okay with that, it\u2019s fair to raise concern with your husband on wether she should be watching them alone at this time. by the way, if she was going to class that day and your husband was at work, who was going to be watching the kid?", "I\u2019m sorry, what the hell? Your ex-husband left your kids with his new girlfriend. She may be a lovely person but she\u2019s obviously not prepared to take care of TWO kids on her own. AND she was leaving for classes? What was the plan, exactly? Were the kids supposed to take care of themselves for several hours? I\u2019d worry less about the age gap and more about whatever the hell was going on there.\n\nNTA, btw. Katie is very confident in her judgement while having no idea how to handle a fever situation. (I mean I\u2019d still call you because I\u2019d be nervous to give medicine to a child without his parents\u2019s verbal consent, he may have allergies or something, but she specifically said she doesn\u2019t know what to do at all.) I don\u2019t think she\u2019s equipped to be in a relationship with kids involved and I sincerely hope it\u2019s not about to bite her.", "NTA, your ex is gross.", "YTA:   \nnone of your business who she, or your ex dates.   \n\n\nI dont think she really did anything wrong in the situation.  She got beyond what she felt like she could handle, and called in help.  Seems reasonable to me.", "LOL\n\nYTA \n\nFunny \nShe is too young\nBut also you\u2019re old enough to know better", "Very very light YTA here, it\u2019s really really rude to comment on someone\u2019s age like that. It\u2019s especially rude to presume to tell someone what to do with their life in their own house. \nI get you were surprised and I\u2019m not saying you are wrong about the age gap, but picking a fight with your ex\u2019s live-in partner about their relationship with your ex is not a move that\u2019s going to end well.", "EHS - OK, it's kinda gross, but it's not illegal for your husband to be dating someone that young... probably should have talked to your ex about it first.\n\nBUT he is TA for leaving your kids in the care of a 19 year old that has other commitments... if he wasn't around and she needed to leave for college, what would they have done?  Just left a 7 and 9 year old to fend for themselves?  This is not a safe place for your kids as she clearly doesn't have the maturity or experience to care for them.", "YTA it really isn\u2019t any of your business how old she is or who she\u2019s dating, and it was rude of you to say that. Did you really think she would say \u201coh wow, my boyfriend\u2019s ex wife thinks I\u2019m too young to be dating my boyfriend, I should definitely listen to her unsolicited opinion!\u201d\n\nYou should probably be more appreciative that your kids have a kind and caring potential stepmom.", "YTA, and incredibly judgemental. It's not your place to say what she is too young for, your ex knows her and obviously trusts her with the children, she did everything right in the situation she was in so I don't see why you have any issues with this.", "YTA \n\nIt's none of your business and not your place to comment to her.", "YTA\n\nWhat two consenting adults do is none of your business.  At all.  This girl called you, to help your son.  Because she was concerned for him.  Then you had to get all high and mighty about the age gap.  Shame on you.", "YTA.  If you have concerns, you bring them up to your ex in private.  That was a crappy thing for you to do.", "YTA.  Not your business as long as she treats the kids well.  Butt out.", "YTA for the comments about her age, that's a discussion to have with your ex if at all. But the story makes no sense.\n\nShe was home alone with your kids, but is \"going to be late for college\"? So who was going to be watching the kids? And she came back hours later, with your ex possibly coming shortly after?", "ESH - you only mildly, though. I would have discussed with your ex, not with her. Meaning, I would have discussed both leaving the kids alone with her, as well as the age discrepancy. It isn't her fault he's being creepy, and she did the right thing in calling you - you'd want her to do that again in the future if they stay together, I assume?", "YTA for judging who she should and should not be dating. Everything else is inconsequential to the discussion here.", "YTA. Your ex dating a fellow consenting adult, and she is an adult, is none of your business. If you had an issue with her inexperience caring for children that would be understandable, but you went directly for her age.", "YTA. They are both adults and can do as they please. You are divorced and no longer have any right to micromanage his personal life - and zero rights to micromanage hers. You did not come from a place of 'concern' about her well-being, you came from a place of judgement - which neither of them asked you for. Keep your personal attacks to yourself.", "Are you REALLY so obtuse?  You told your ex's new love interest she was not appropriate for him.       YTA.", "YTA.", "yta. i agree that someone as young as her shouldn't be dating someone as old as your ex (power imbalance and him possibly being only a handful of years younger than her own parents) but nothing in this situation really warranted you saying that", "YTA You should be happy that she\u2019s a kind and caring person that your children will be around. And she wasn\u2019t too proud to call you and let you know your son needed you and that she wasn\u2019t sure what to do. You could\u2019ve taken this and built a great relationship with her since she\u2019s going to be in your children\u2019s lives, but now she may not feel comfortable calling you next time something comes up because she doesn\u2019t want to listen to your judgements about her life.", "YTA - Stating she is too young to date someone who is twice her age was not necessary or factual. How are you not an ahole?", "YTA- are you wrong, no. Was it your place to say it? No. \n\nTheres no way you can say anything Negative about their relationship without seeming like a bitter ex.\n\nBest thing you can do now is apologize. Say \"I'm sorry. That was an inappropriate thing for me to say. I reacted out of concern for both you and my children, but you are an adult and it was disrespectful to judge you based on your age\"", "YTA, while I personally agree she is too young for him she is still an adult and her partners ex telling her she is too young is not accomplishing anything productive. She treats your kids well and knows when she is in over her head so no danger there so not really your place.", "I agree with you here about the age gap, but YTA for mentioning it to her. You guys are divorced, keep all comments about his partners either to yourself or share with your own friends/family where he and the kids won\u2019t hear anything. They won\u2019t stop their relationship because you noted the age difference. They may however make comments about you to the kids or be less inclined to play nice with you in the future.\n\nToday this woman felt out of depth caring for your son and called you to make sure he was safe and well looked after, in the future she may not feel comfortable doing the same thing and your kids could suffer as a result.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s about putting your kids first, as long as his partners are not harmful to your children you need to butt out.

Ain't nothing to be jealous of here.

Honestly the young woman calling the mother show's that she was aware there was an issue and she resolved it.

I never put my phone on silent... 24 hours A-day I am always able to be reached By my kids", "I think it was more about her having to leave then not being able to handle it. On the flip side of the fever was very high she did right to call a parent,", "I think I would need to know more about the situation to judge that she didn't know what to do. Or how things are normally done in that household. Like, did the child go to school and get sent home sick and she was the only one available to pick him up, then called OP because she had to be at school?

I don't think she was trying for a long time she called me almost immediately after she found out, before the school even opened I don't see the issue with this honestly", "Twice", "It\u2019s just not her place. Her thinking she\u2019s too young for her ex has nothing to do with her kids. The gf did the right thing by calling her. The same thing would have happened if she was 40 years old and had to go to work. The issue if anything lies with the ex for leaving her there if he knew she had somewhere to be and couldn\u2019t stay. She can take it up with him, but there\u2019s no reason to place blame on the girlfriend for being with someone she deems too old for her", "I'm curious, do you understand what the point of this sub is?", "I'd guess that the father left before the kid woke up and anyone realised the son was ill. \n\nYes, it's certainly something that should have been planned out before leaving a nine year old in the car of someone who wasn't really equipped to deal with all the variegated ways kids can upend your day.", "I think it just shows this young woman is conscientious as she contacted the mother and made sure the child was not left alone.  So well done by this young lady for picking up after the dad dropped the ball.", "Think about it. Hmm what could it be.", "Well, judging from OP's post, the young woman wasn't capable of making her own decisions as she had to call OP.", "Plenty of people do it because older poeple have much more experience and confidence.

Good thing you were easy to reach, but what if you hadn\u2019t been? Especially since your ex was out of reach.

So unless you plan to judge anyone he dates that doesn\u2019t already have a kid, you aren\u2019t being truthful with yourself. First of all she did the right thing by reaching out to you and owning her na\u00efvet\u00e9 on children\u2019s fevers. That is pretty mature honestly. The problem is you were taken aback by her age and whether or not you are right they will or won\u2019t match due to age, that has nothing to do with trying to frame this as she doesn\u2019t have the experience to handle my kids. YTA for inserting your opinion of their relationship when not asked. You are not the AH for having thoughts about the age difference. But you have no right to interject your thoughts into their life.

Hell I bet you couldn't even state it coherently.\n\n I can say *you* do have an adenda and that is to judge other people unfairly, perhaps you were judged unfairly as a kid...IDK but to suggest that all relationships in which the man is older than woman, and that age gap is not what you consider normal, are abusive without some sort of documentation to support it is irresponsible. FYI, I was marreid for 22 years to a woman was 3 years older than me and have always preferred woman my own age.", "Aren\u2019t you the one who said always abuse? I wasn\u2019t  making a judgment on the op here.", "She infact made a decision...she called the mom. I would have done the same thing when tending to a kid who is not mine.

I thought she was the 23 year old nor you", "I\u2019m actually surprised you\u2019re as cool as you are about some person you know almost nothing about being involved in taking care of your kids. You must be on really excellent terms with your ex and have a great deal of trust regarding co-parenting. My kids are grown but if I had been in that situation I would have wanted to know as much as possible about anyone being in close contact with my child.
