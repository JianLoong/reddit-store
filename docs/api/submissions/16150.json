I'm Pregnant and Concerned About Second-hand Smoke.", "selftext": "I (30f) used to be very, very close to my friend \"Stacy\" (27f). We've grown apart over the past few years but still enjoy each other's company. We live a few hours away from each other. Stacy will stay with me for a weekend 3\u20135 times every year, and I take day trips to visit her about twice a year. I don't visit more because of her living situation.\n\nStacy is a smoker. Every time we walk outside, she lights up\u2014even if we're just walking from a cafe to the car. She also goes outside specifically to smoke several times each day. Stacy used to talk a lot about how she wasn't addicted and could stop anytime she wanted, but she hasn't said that much in the past year. I wish she would quit for her own health and finances, but Stacy's smoking has never really bothered me. \n\n However, I'm pregnant now, and I'm concerned about second-hand smoke. When Stacy found out about my pregnancy, she was ecstatic. She loves babies, pregnant women, and the idea of being pregnant herself one day. She started talking about how she is going to stay with me much more frequently over the coming months and how she will visit every weekend after the baby is born. \n\nI told Stacy that I was no longer comfortable with her staying at my house at all until she stops smoking, but that we could FaceTime or meet up sometimes for a meal if she promises not to smoke in my presence or shortly before meeting up. Stacy blew up. She called me names, accused me of trying to end our friendship, and said it was horrible that I was keeping her away from my baby when I know how much she loves children and that she's going through a rough time. \n\nI might be the asshole for a few reasons. First, I snapped at her. I told her that if she really loves babies that much then she can quit, and that she's going to have to quit anyways if she wants to have children herself. Second, Stacy *has* been going through a rough time, and our friendship means a lot to her. She doesn't have very many friends or much family support. I care about Stacy and I'm not trying to end our friendship, but I think I need to prioritize my baby's health and my peace of mind. Third, I don't want to increase the frequency of our visits. Even if she does stop smoking, I don't want her over every weekend. But I know how much these visits mean to her. \n\nAdditionally, I wonder if Stacy's right\u2014am I making too big a deal of this? She said she wouldn't smoke in front of me and that she would wash her hands after smoking outside. I don't know whether that little exposure would even make a difference. And growing up, my family hosted guests who smoked (outside), and I spent a lot of time with family friends and family members who smoked. I cherish these memories and I'm glad my parents weren't so rigid. So I wonder if I'm being too rigid now.", "created_utc": 1682966414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134xiwl/aita_for_refusing_to_host_my_friend_until_she/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His mother is a heavy smoker and while she smokes outside, it wafts and EVERYTHING smelled. There is absolutely nothing wrong with setting boundaries. You have to do what you are comfortable with and the health and safety of you and your child are what is most important. Second and third hand smoke can be very dangerous especially for newborns. While I'm sure it's sad that she is going through a rough time, but that's not really your problem. I'm not saying don't be supportive, but don't do things that are going to make you anxious or question yourself. \n\nI took spent time with friends and family who smoked growing up but that doesn't mean those things were necessarily the best decisions.

You, and everyone you slow to interact with them, needs to be conscious of their health and safety because they are 100% dependent on all of you. And secondhand smoke is unquestionably a risk to the child. \n\nAs a parent you have every right to set this boundary for every person who will interact with your child.

It's very real and something you should be aware of. Here's a snippet from the Mayo Clinic:\n\n> Thirdhand smoke is made up of the pollutants that settle indoors when tobacco is smoked. The chemicals in thirdhand smoke include nicotine as well as cancer-causing substances such as formaldehyde, naphthalene and others.\n\n> Thirdhand smoke builds up on surfaces over time. It can become embedded in most soft surfaces such as clothing, furniture, drapes, bedding and carpets. It also settles as dust-like particles on hard surfaces such as walls, floors and in vehicles. Thirdhand smoke can remain for many months even after smoking has stopped.", "NTA this is about the health of the child, which absolutely should be your #1 priority.

The health of your unborn child matters. There are tons of studies on the impact of thirdhand smoke, which is what you and your baby would be exposed to even if she wasn't smoking around you. The impact on your child's health would be significant.\n\nYou're not being too rigid. It's a reasonable boundary and your friend will need to decide whether she cares about you or smoking more. \n\nFrankly it sounds like you do a lot for this person and get little in return. I think setting this boundary is going to expose some of that for you.", "NTA!  I once was working with a temp agency, and was told me about a position with a fertility clinic, but it was stipulated that you cannot be a smoker to work there.

I have epilepsy and who's to say it wasn't from that second-hand smoke? Either way, the very smell of smoke on Stacy's clothing would make me nervous, and it's very unlikely she will completely refrain from smoking during the visit. Baby's safety comes first.", "NTA.

It is not up to you to make her happy or fix her life.", "NTA, you have a right to be concerned about second-hand smoke.

Also there are very few people I could handle hosting every weekend haha, never mind while caring for a newborn...", "NTA at all on the smoking issue. I do also think you need to consider how much Stacy is reliant on you and how much she's inserting herself in your life - to tell a new mother that she will visit every weekend after you've had a baby is insane.

I would advise you to take a step back from her friendship in general as it seems she prioritises her own needs over yours, based on those two examples alone.", "NTA coming from a smoker for the past decade.

Make an effort to call and supply her.", "You said, \"*I need to prioritize my baby's health and my peace of mind.*\" \n\nAnd you are absolutely correct!

You don't want a smoker around your baby AND you don't want her over every weekend. \n\nIt's time to set some boundaries with Stacy & stand firm.\n\nNTA", "Third hand smoke is a thing too.

Your child comes first.", "NTA. Some smoke is stuck on the clothing anyway.

Second hand smoke is very impactful on pregnancies and very young children.

I myself don\u2019t see the harm in being around a smoker as long as they don\u2019t actively smoke around you. The \u201cif you loved babies you would quit\u201d comment is what makes me feel your just pushing this as an excuse to have more space. If that\u2019s the case it\u2019s totally fine, but it doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. We can\u2019t always please everyone, someone has to be the AH sometimes ya know?\n\nBut if it really is just a smell thing it is what it is, pregnant woman are more sensitive to smells. Tell her the smell makes you nauseous and you just don\u2019t want to be around it. That is not an AH move, that\u2019s just not wanting to get sick."]}
