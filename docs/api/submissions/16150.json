I'm Pregnant and Concerned About Second-hand Smoke.", "selftext": "I (30f) used to be very, very close to my friend \"Stacy\" (27f). We've grown apart over the past few years but still enjoy each other's company. We live a few hours away from each other. Stacy will stay with me for a weekend 3\u20135 times every year, and I take day trips to visit her about twice a year. I don't visit more because of her living situation.\n\nStacy is a smoker. Every time we walk outside, she lights up\u2014even if we're just walking from a cafe to the car. She also goes outside specifically to smoke several times each day. Stacy used to talk a lot about how she wasn't addicted and could stop anytime she wanted, but she hasn't said that much in the past year. I wish she would quit for her own health and finances, but Stacy's smoking has never really bothered me. \n\n However, I'm pregnant now, and I'm concerned about second-hand smoke. When Stacy found out about my pregnancy, she was ecstatic. She loves babies, pregnant women, and the idea of being pregnant herself one day. She started talking about how she is going to stay with me much more frequently over the coming months and how she will visit every weekend after the baby is born. \n\nI told Stacy that I was no longer comfortable with her staying at my house at all until she stops smoking, but that we could FaceTime or meet up sometimes for a meal if she promises not to smoke in my presence or shortly before meeting up. Stacy blew up. She called me names, accused me of trying to end our friendship, and said it was horrible that I was keeping her away from my baby when I know how much she loves children and that she's going through a rough time. \n\nI might be the asshole for a few reasons. First, I snapped at her. I told her that if she really loves babies that much then she can quit, and that she's going to have to quit anyways if she wants to have children herself. Second, Stacy *has* been going through a rough time, and our friendship means a lot to her. She doesn't have very many friends or much family support. I care about Stacy and I'm not trying to end our friendship, but I think I need to prioritize my baby's health and my peace of mind. Third, I don't want to increase the frequency of our visits. Even if she does stop smoking, I don't want her over every weekend. But I know how much these visits mean to her. \n\nAdditionally, I wonder if Stacy's right\u2014am I making too big a deal of this? She said she wouldn't smoke in front of me and that she would wash her hands after smoking outside. I don't know whether that little exposure would even make a difference. And growing up, my family hosted guests who smoked (outside), and I spent a lot of time with family friends and family members who smoked. I cherish these memories and I'm glad my parents weren't so rigid. So I wonder if I'm being too rigid now.", "created_utc": 1682966414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134xiwl/aita_for_refusing_to_host_my_friend_until_she/", "score": 1004, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His mother is a heavy smoker and while she smokes outside, it wafts and EVERYTHING smelled. There is absolutely nothing wrong with setting boundaries. You have to do what you are comfortable with and the health and safety of you and your child are what is most important. Second and third hand smoke can be very dangerous especially for newborns.

I'm not saying don't be supportive, but don't do things that are going to make you anxious or question yourself. \n\nI took spent time with friends and family who smoked growing up but that doesn't mean those things were necessarily the best decisions.

You, and everyone you slow to interact with them, needs to be conscious of their health and safety because they are 100% dependent on all of you. And secondhand smoke is unquestionably a risk to the child. \n\nAs a parent you have every right to set this boundary for every person who will interact with your child.

It's very real and something you should be aware of. Here's a snippet from the Mayo Clinic:\n\n> Thirdhand smoke is made up of the pollutants that settle indoors when tobacco is smoked. The chemicals in thirdhand smoke include nicotine as well as cancer-causing substances such as formaldehyde, naphthalene and others.\n\n> Thirdhand smoke builds up on surfaces over time. It can become embedded in most soft surfaces such as clothing, furniture, drapes, bedding and carpets. It also settles as dust-like particles on hard surfaces such as walls, floors and in vehicles. Thirdhand smoke can remain for many months even after smoking has stopped.", "NTA this is about the health of the child, which absolutely should be your #1 priority.

The health of your unborn child matters. There are tons of studies on the impact of thirdhand smoke, which is what you and your baby would be exposed to even if she wasn't smoking around you. The impact on your child's health would be significant.\n\nYou're not being too rigid. It's a reasonable boundary and your friend will need to decide whether she cares about you or smoking more. \n\nFrankly it sounds like you do a lot for this person and get little in return. I think setting this boundary is going to expose some of that for you.", "NTA!  I once was working with a temp agency, and was told me about a position with a fertility clinic, but it was stipulated that you cannot be a smoker to work there.

Either way, the very smell of smoke on Stacy's clothing would make me nervous, and it's very unlikely she will completely refrain from smoking during the visit. Baby's safety comes first.", "NTA.

It is not up to you to make her happy or fix her life.", "NTA, you have a right to be concerned about second-hand smoke.

Also there are very few people I could handle hosting every weekend haha, never mind while caring for a newborn...", "NTA at all on the smoking issue. I do also think you need to consider how much Stacy is reliant on you and how much she's inserting herself in your life - to tell a new mother that she will visit every weekend after you've had a baby is insane.

I would advise you to take a step back from her friendship in general as it seems she prioritises her own needs over yours, based on those two examples alone.", "NTA coming from a smoker for the past decade.

I\u2019d never argue that.\n\nBut I will question how necessary it is when asked, and OP is asking. It\u2019s a situation where it\u2019s not wrong to set the boundary, and is factually the correct thing to do. But it\u2019s also not wrong to acknowledge that the chance of contaminating the fetus is incredibly small in these particular circumstances.", "Clothing my dude. Listed clearly in the link. Until it is washed, it has thirdhand smoke. Even if she goes outside to smoke, her clothes will still be covered with it throughout the visit. And she plans to visit every weekend apparently, so yes, it\u2019s an issue.\n\nNo contact was not OP\u2019s idea, anyway. OP offered a compromise (no smoking during get togethers and not immediately before meeting) before the friend ever freaked out about it. Those measures seem pretty reasonable given the level of risk.", "You really, honestly, truly believe OPs baby will die of SIDS from OP being around someone\u2019s clothes for a few weekend visits? I understand there are theoretical risks, but all of those studies are talking about long term exposure. And risk factors. Not guarantees.", "Most parents are not willing to take risks that can easily be reduced. And it\u2019s OP\u2019s right to make this decision for herself.\n\nBut if it\u2019s not a big deal to you, you can make the choices you feel are appropriate with your own newborn.", "Biologically, I don't think secondhand smoke this far removed is harmful to your or your baby.  Assuming she only smokes outdoors, doesn't blow it in your face, and especially if she washes her hands.  I grew up with smokers and it is a different story when they smoke in the house, with the windows closed for months during the winter.  \n\n\nIt was bordering on assholic to boss her around with the \"if you want to be my friend/see my kid/have a kid of your own, you'll quit\" routine.  And it was a little over the border of assholic for her to call you names--although you provoked her.  I'm going with ESH.", "NTA.\n\nSecond-hand and third-hand smoke are hazards to infants. If she wants to visit, especially when Baby is still young, she needs to smoke outside and then wash her hands and change her shirt to ensure baby is not exposed.", "NTA. \n\nIf you just had a baby, you will be exhausted for the first couple of years - the LAST thing you want is people over all the damn time. \n\nIt's not just her coming over every other weekend - it's your parents, your siblings, your partners parents and siblings, and other friends, etc.", "NTA. As a smoker there are alternatives. She can just buy some nicotine pouches, lozenges, tablets, patches, or gum. That's 5 smokeless alternatives she could use right there. You are more than welcome to be concerned about secondhand smoke.", "There\u2019s even such a thing as third hand smoke because it sticks on clothes and blankets and everything and can be transferred through touch to animals and babies. NTA you would be TA if you didn\u2019t set this boundary", "NTA please talk to your OBGYN about SIDS and 2nd/3rd hand smoke\n\nThis isn't just simply you smell bad, or it makes me uncomfortable. Stacey's smoking addiction isn't more important than your baby.", "NTA!\n\nYour health! Your baby's health. Also, your house, your rules.\n\nGift Stacy a box of either nicotine gum or patches and stay firm to your rules.", "Nta\n\nFormer smoker (so I get how hard it is to not smoke) and child-free by choice (so I get the perspective of a non-parent).\n\nSo many studies have come out about second AND THIRD hand smoking dangers. \n\nNTA.\n\nMy mom smoked while pregnant with me. While I've never been diagnosed with anything in particular, I see things in my personality and behavior that I wonder about the source. Protect your child.", "Decisions you took so far are the right ones. Don\u2019t change them. NTA", "NTA. Smoking, even second hand is not good for you or your baby. Also people who are smokers tend to have smoke residue in places other than their hands. It seeps into their clothes and even if they\u2019re washed the smell is still there, into their furniture, the carpeting and leaves a film on their walls (if they smoke inside) and their car seats (if they smoke in the car). It\u2019s going to be on the rest of her skin and in her hair. You have every right to set boundaries and stick to them.", "Nicotine is 'one of the most heavily used addictive drugs' and your friend is behaving like the majority of addicts who are told it's unacceptable by accusing you of being unreasonable.\n\nYou have a right to your opinion and well-being of you and your baby.", "You also have to consider 3rd hand smoke, yes a real thing. Which is the residue left on clothing/skin/hair ect. the most common cause of smoke injury to babies. Lots of people think that if they wash their hands thats good enough, then they breathe the particles all over baby\u2019s face and hold them against their clothes.", "Smoke causes SIDS in babies. NTA", "NTA - smoking is bad for your health and for those breathing in second hand smoke too.", "NTA.  Whatever she thinks of your rules is unimportant.  Even if smoking actually were harmless, it wouldn't matter.  Anyone who wants to have a relationship with your child will need to adhere to whatever guidelines you put in place.\n\nHer tantrum should not be rewarded, neither should you feel bad for holding your ground.  Her \"rough time\" is not your OR your baby's responsibility, and the needs and health of your child are not trumped by her desire to have things her way.\n\nShe sounds manipulative and self-serving.  Maybe it's time you outgrew her.", "Nta. \n\nYou will be so much more sensitive to smells when pregnant.", "Nope, it\u2019s gonna be all over her clothes.

NTA.", "Years ago I worked at a vet clinic that had occasional cats or dogs board that would reek so badly of smoke I'd have to bathe them on arrival just to keep the kennel from smelling like an ash tray. I distinctly remember one cat that had an actual smoker's cough. For any smokers reading this, your smoke smells worse than a room that a dog just shit in.", "Cigarette smoke stays on smokers clothes.
