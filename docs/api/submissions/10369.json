Also, why would you get a husky when you guys have zero experience or desire to do what is needed?? Huskies need structure and theyre super high energy! Please just find him a home with an experienced dog owner.", "ESH. Girl get your head together and get out of there. It's dangerous to have a large, untrained dog once the baby arrives, and it clearly won't change. What if you have a C-section or are even just carrying an infant with a huge dog jumping on your stomach? While your bf sits there and lets you struggle alone. It won't be workable. Go home to your parents.", "ESH. \n\nHonestly, no one here is a competent pet owner and I'm super concerned that you're bringing a child into this situation. This is a disaster.", "What's best for that dog is a different home.  People food at best will give him long term health problems,  and at worst kill him.\nYta if you keep the dog", "ESH. Are you really in your mid twenties? It reads like a teenager.", "I fear I might be about to answer a question that you havent even asked but here goes. Huskies are working dogs who need a lot of training and stimulation. It sounds like your dog is acting out because they aren't getting any sort of enrichment or opportunity to let off steam. This is animal cruelty. Sorry to sound preachy but it is. If you are to keep this dog you need to solicit the advice of an expert in canine behaviour (vet or canine behaviourist) on how best to train and stimulate your dog, and then follow their advice. The dog jumping up like that is a safety hazard, especially with you being pregnant and they need to be taught how to behave safely before the baby arrives.\n\nAlso, why are your family allowing your dog go eat donuts? Our sweet treats can be poisonous to dogs and cats. If you want to treat him, there are plenty of dog treats on the market. Alternatively, you can always start putting aside some left over meat or fish (just make sure it doesnt have any sauce or seasoning, as this could be harmful for the dog) and placing it in a designated treat bowl. Again, you cant be having them jumping up and snatching food from a defenceless child!\n\nSorry, I know this isnt the answer you asked for but I'm more concerned about the welfare of your dog and unborn child than your argument with your boyfriend.", "EHS this dog sounds like it needs to be rehomed since NONE of you are capable or willing to train it.

Please look into an ethical way to rehomed your dog and PLEASE do a better job raising your child than you did this poor animal.", "Nta. Untrained dogs have no business being around babies.

Oof.", "This story just kept getting worse and worse", "There's absolutely nothing in what you just said that justifies your dog not being trained, if you couldn't care for him properly why get a dog at all ? He's not even potty trained that's just ridiculous. You're both adults you need to do better if you hadn' t specified how old you were I would've thought you were teenagers.

And you haven't trained him for 2 years?! It's not housebroken (WHAT), it eats all your food, and makes a mess (in someone else's home, but I'll get to that). That's straight up negligence, you should give the dog to someone who will care for it properly.\n\nYou say the reason he's untrained is that you guys are living at his parents' place. I'm sorry, that's such poor planning. You cannot get a dog just to raise it in someone else's home. You should have waited until you were in the right situation to properly care for your dog before getting one.\n\nAnd THEN, you and your boyfriend are casually feeding the dog donuts?? That's not proper food or nutrition. Those donuts can have all kind of garbage in them that could make your dog sick. Do you know anything about raising a dog?\n\nAnd you keep chocolate donuts so close to him where he can casually grab them from your hand, wtf. Your BF is not only an idiot for thinking the dog can have donuts, but for encouraging you to give in to the dog's whining. His parents aren't spoiling the dog, you guys are. You guys sound completely clueless about the poor dog that's now caught in your mess.\n\nI hope you have plans to move out before giving birth because this doesn't sound like the best environment to raise a child in.

So it pees and poops everywhere, it also eats human food. We haven\u2019t been able to train the dog since we are living with his parents, and it\u2019s really hard to move without being noticed or being berated by his mom. They also spoiled the dog so it really didn\u2019t learn anything to the point that when we are eating, it jumps to the table and will eat the food. It annoys the hell out of me but they just let the dog do it. \n\nFast forward to this day, I woke up late since boyfriend and I went to a wake last night. I was so hungry so I didn\u2019t wake up my boyfriend and I ate alone. The dog was nowhere to be found so I ate in peace. After four-five hours, I was hungry again because I am 23 weeks pregnant. It\u2019s a good thing that boyfriend\u2019s parents went home and brought a donut. Boyfriend is also awake this time, the dog is also now in the living room with us. \n\nI ate a chocolate donut first and the dog jumped in my belly. My belly\u2019s bigger now so it really hurts when the dog do that. I told the dog that he\u2019s not allowed to eat the donut as it is chocolate but he still is jumping on me so I yelled at my boyfriend saying to come and get the dog. He didn\u2019t do it and just yelled at the dog too. I ended up standing at the sofa so the dog can\u2019t reach me. Then I ate my 2nd donut, which is blueberry. Again, the dog still wanted to eat whatever I am eating but I just had one bite and it wants to eat the donut. My boyfriend told me to give the dog some, I told him that I will but let me have at least half of it. Mind you, the dog already ate a vanilla flavored donut. Anyway, the dog just stand in front of me while I am eating, I haven\u2019t even tasted the blueberry part of the donut but my boyfriend insist that I give the dog the donut. \n\nAt this point, I am really pissed so I just left the half eaten donut to my boyfriend and told him not to let the dog starve but let me starve instead. I stormed out.\n\nI am now in our room for six hours now. I haven\u2019t had dinner and it\u2019s almost midnight here so I\u2019m really hungry. I locked the door but he got in just to get the phone\u2019s charger. He didn\u2019t even say sorry. I want to go home to my parents tomorrow if he will not say sorry.
