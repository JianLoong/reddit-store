Coming from a 33 year old who admittedly doesn't have kids, a parent should still not be, in my opinion, devaluing a childs experiences just because they aren't in the same ballpark as their parents. It may very well be true, but it's irrelevant. A child is learning to be a person, and their ability to handle adversity is a constant work in progress. It might seem over dramatic to an adult when a child falls and hurts themselves and then proceeds to cry hardcore, but that's because the child has experienced such rushes of pain and anxiety a short few times in their life...also even as an adult I have to take a sit down and squeeze my toes when I stub them, so we're not exactly immune to our own pains. The same goes for non-physical hurts.\n\n>however to me shed keep on saying how If she were to \u2018live by my rules\u2019 she should have k worded herself the moment i was born and that my birth was the reason she got depressed in the first place.\n\nThis is also pretty fucked up to say, just putting that out there to affirm you in your feelings on the matter.\n\n>\u201ca good daughter would invite me to a fancy dinner and buy me a nice present considering how much i do for her\u201d\n\nHow much she does for you is both an obligation, and it sounds like the bare minimum. Secondly, even if she was an above and beyond parent this line of dialogue is still very passive aggressive and manipulative.\n\n>\u201cnever considered how she felt when i always asked her for stuff like all my expensive clothes\u201d\n\nAt this point I'm going to assume, \"expensive clothes\" means just...clothes in general.\n\nAlso, when it's your father footing the bill and the work, than really she's not paying for shit. Yea, ok, she gets money from him, but as far as it sounds she doesn't contribute much and then complains when pilfered family assets aren't used on herself.\n\n>Shes now crying to my entire family saying i Was being ungrateful and all of them are on her side so\n\nThe halmark of the narcissist. She ran to outside figures who aren't important to the conflict to pressure you into submission. They're hearing a skewed version of the story that absolves her of all culpability, and probably frames her as innocent just wanting to lay down on the couch and being told off if it implies any motivating force from her in the first place.\n\nAs you grow up I'm afraid you're going to have to realize that there's functionally no way of winning the popularity war with a narcissistic parent. They'll smear you to people who've known them longer and those people will invariably believe them because of ageism and the amount of theatrics she displays.\n\nThe best thing you can do is just avoid her, ignore her, and not play into her games.\n\nMy recommendation is go check out r/raisedbynarcissists for support and information on how to manage your situation.\n\nYou are NTA btw.", "You're in a very tough spot. Narcissism is common in Bipolar diagnosis, so she wouldn't need to be diagnosed separately. I have BiPolar so I have some sympathy for her being exhausted, but she should never take it out on you.

Very narcissistic, the world revolves around her, and the second you remind her it doesn\u2019t the victim comes out. Even when they\u2019re the bad guy, they can\u2019t be the bad guy because they\u2019re a victim.  So as the child, I feel for you. It has nothing to do with you as a person, as I\u2019m sure she goes through life doing this to everyone. As a mother, I understand being being stressed, having postpartum depression, long term depression and all that, but that\u2019s stuff you don\u2019t tell your kids. You don\u2019t blame anyone, especially your children who didn\u2019t ask to be here. I don\u2019t doubt that she\u2019s really going through it mentally, but to constantly bring that up and throw it in someone\u2019s face is manipulation. They try to get it off themselves by casting it onto someone else, but it\u2019s not yours to carry! Sadly, I wouldn\u2019t expect her to change. I know my mother\u2019s brain is just wired that way after this long and there\u2019s no getting her to see how screwed up it is. Your best hope is just remembering that it\u2019s not your fault as she was probably this same way before you were born, and just getting out of there as soon as you can.", "As a fellow bipolar person, no narcissism is not. There is mania and that can cause things like grandiose plans, reckless decisions and paranoia. But that\u2019s not Narcissistic Personality Disorder. They are seperate disorders that do need to be assessed and treated separately. Please stop furthering dangerous stigma and stereotypes."]}
