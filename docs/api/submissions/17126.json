Yeah, it's \"just highschool\", but it's also the biggest thing that kid has achieved thus far.

You're allowed to graduate without your mother there, she's allowed to be a little salty but it's not your responsibility to make her feel better about it.", "Nta but I get her feelings.", "My dad handed me my diploma because he worked in my high school. Everyone knew he was my dad. It was so much more special because he was part of it. \n\nI was graduating but it was his moment too. It\u2019s so special seeing your kids conquer life because that is your hard work too. \n\nIt\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t want her to hand you your diploma. In the end, that\u2019s your graduation and your ceremony. But I thought I would give you the insight of someone who has gone through the same situation. And if it helps, no one will care and does who do you only think that it\u2019s sweet. \n\nNAH", "NAH.\n\nFrom your mom\u2019s perspective this is nice thing she can do *for you*. It\u2019s a rare and special opportunity and you can\u2019t redo it. She hopefully wants this to happen for the best reasons: because she loves you, because she wants you to see that love, and because she believes there will be a day when you will look at your anxiety from a place of confidence and security and wonder how it ever controlled your life.\n\nAll that being said: the choice is yours, and while all that is nice what you need *now* is for the day to go as close as possible to the image in your head. You (hopefully) know you can\u2019t control everything, but doing this will hopefully make the day easier.\n\nIt\u2019s okay for your mom to be disappointed - my guess is part of that is feeling helpless that she can\u2019t help you more with your anxiety and that she can\u2019t stop you from struggling and suffering so much over something so irrelevant to anyone else. However, your mom becomes the A if she guilts you about this.\n\nGood luck with everything! I hope you do get to the point where you can look back at this and see how far you\u2019ve come.", "\"Your graduation isn't only about you\". Who TF is it for then? Tell you what, why not stay at home, pay for my air fare to wherever you live and I'll pick it up for you. Being as your graduation is not just about you, it might as well be for me as well. Utterly absurd.\n\nIf you would feel crushingly embarrassed by it, or any similar situation, I don't think it's wrong to ask your mum to step aside but she is clearly proud of you for graduating.\n\nI was going to go N A H but considering her response to a legitimate request, you get a NTA from me.", "NAH. She can ask. And I'm glad she let you say no. It would likely be a really special and cool moment to look back on, but you're young, and don't see the value of that right now. And yes, your graduation is about you. Your parents contributed a lot to your success, but you're the one graduating.", "Your graduation is in fact only about you. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand the \u201cbut it would be a nice thing to do for your mom\u201d people.\n\n\nIt would have been nice for her to take your feelings into account first instead of deciding for herself and getting her own hopes up completely independent of what you, the person actually graduating, would prefer.\n\n\nNothing wrong with not wanting your own mother to be on stage with you at graduation. I would be mortified too.", "NAH. But I can relate; my dad served on the board of education in my town he handed me my high school diploma. I also was very anxious about it but it was totally fine and actually turned out to be a wonderful moment between us. My dad passed away about a year and a half ago and I still watch the video of him handing me my diploma and the look on his face when he hands it to me is something I will always cherish.", "NTA \"it's not all about you\" it is actually YOU are the person who just finished highschool, YOU are the ones who passed all the tests and homework YOU are the person graduating. She needs to accept your wishes were more important here.", "NTA \n\nI thought the diploma was handed by the head of the school?", "NTA. I work at a district where parents may give their child their diploma. There is always more than one. The parent just taps in on the school board member handing the diploma.

You know it sounds dumb because it is in fact dumb.  If my kid had told me she didn\u2019t wNt me to give her her diploma I would have been heartbroken.

Please re-consider your stance on this. There is no \"do over\" for something like this.\n\nEither way NTA, but unless your mom is a horrible abusive mother, I really see no reason to do this to her.", "AH. she is your mother. Get over yourself. This should be something incredibly special & positive. Be thankful they are supporting you. Unless there is something missing from the post?!", "YTA. Solid. Unambiguous.\n\nYou've taken a future memory from her that would have cost you precisely nothing to give.", "YTA. It's high school graduation. Absolutely nobody sits around and reminisces about their high school graduation day.

Don't blame social anxiety, or your Mum, or tell your Mum what she gets to feel by watching from the stands instead.  You're clearly not prepared to change your mind.\n\nOther posters have correctly said this graduation is about you not her, but you also expressed disappointment in her choosing your school while you were in senior year, then her choice of something she is REQUIRED to volunteer at an event for, and it honestly sounds like you're thinking you're the adult in this relationship.  Her job is about her, not you.", "YTA: You're being over sensitive about something that is really nothing.  She's just doing a job, and it's simply handing you a piece of paper.", "your graduation IS only about you, great that she's proud, etc., but no, this is your day, your accomplishment and it's your decision\n\nI assume she knows about your social anxiety? For that reason, I would say her saltiness is uncalled for.

My mom was in the same situation and she gave me my diploma. There were maybe 2-3 other students who had parents working and did the same, but she would have completely understood if I didn\u2019t want it. She also made sure to ask me how I genuinely felt about it before we decided. \n\nYour mom will get over it. It\u2019s your decision. But it can also help to understand where she\u2019s coming from. My mom and I fought a lot during my middle & high school years about school, so it was really good for us to have that resolution. \n\nYou still have plenty of time, but you should also do some soul-searching on the social anxiety. Nobody cares nearly as much as you feel they do. I\u2019d be willing to bet some kids would be jealous to have their parent hand it to them, too. \n\nYou\u2019ll get there, but you\u2019re completely within your rights to make this decision for yourself. And your mom will get over it."]}
