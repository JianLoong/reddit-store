We lost our mom when we were 3, 5 and 7 and our dad remarried when we were 4, 6 and 8. It felt like they had known each other about a month when they got married but it possible they were together longer. About a month after mom died dad was in a widows and widowers group and that's how he met his wife, Beth. Beth lost her husband and had no kids. When they got married they sat us down and told us Beth was going to adopt us. My older brother and I objected. But we were ignored. Around that time we heard some extended family try to talk them out of it as well, saying we would be taken care of if anything happened to our father, no need to go through with the adoption. Beth told them she was our mother now and the adoption needed to happen. We spoke to a social worker and the judge before the adoption happened. Initially their request was rejected based on our conversations. But then they came up with a story that we'd have nobody else to take care of us and our family had already said they wouldn't raise us if anything happened to dad and it was done.\n\nOlder brother and I never liked it, younger brother didn't really no any better but by age 7 was saying he wished he wasn't adopted as well. He could have been copying us. But he says he really feels that way so...\n\nWe have new birth certificates ever since the adoption and her name is in the place of mother. Found that out when I gave my mom's name in school one day and had to bring in my birth certificate and saw Beth's name. My brothers had no idea that had happened either. It pissed off my older brother so much that he told Beth he hoped she would die and we could be adopted again since she was far more replaceable than mom. That incident made Beth and our father put him into  therapy with them. That lasted for two years until he moved out last year. He then asked our maternal grandparents to adopt him since he couldn't find a way to reverse the adoption.\n\nRecently Beth and my father have figured out that I want to do the same and so does my younger brother. Beth broke down and said she just wanted the chance to be a mother and wanted us to love her back. My father suggested they do therapy with me and my brother (separate sessions with each of us) and that we try to work out a compromise. I told him it was too late for that. They already erased mom and nothing they could say would make me feel different about what they did. I told Beth we were never her children and she would need to accept the fact she was never going to be loved back. My father told me that wasn't true. We could still work something out, like have our grandparents adopt us but call him and Beth mom and dad and let them still be parents and grandparents in the future.\n\nWhen I said there was no room for compromise and it was too late they said I was being so unfair.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Just some points that have been brought up. Both times the adoption petition went to court. The first time was rejected because of what we said. Nothing was brought up then about nobody being willing to take us so it was assumed we'd have family who could prevent us going into care. The second time dad made it seem like none of our family were willing to be there if he died and he was so afraid of that. We did no speaking the second time. No interview. It was just dad and Beth and their lawyer talking. They had the old notes from before.\n\nWas also asked to add that Beth always wanted to be a mother. She could not have kids. Was okay with that. Then her husband died and she thought she was given a chance to have kids.", "created_utc": 1679834814, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122l0h5/aita_for_telling_my_father_and_his_wife_that_its/", "score": 7767, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rather than engage in family therapy, which is a huge ask since so much has been thrust upon you in so short a period of time, consider requesting therapy on your own. A therapist may be able to help you start sorting through your feelings and developing strategies to deal with your situation now - and on your parents dime - rather than letting all this fester inside you through early adulthood.\n\nYou\u2019re already doing an awesome job of expressing your feelings and intentions and knowing your worth! \ud83d\udc4a\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - The timeline between your dad meeting Beth and marrying her is irrelevant, them trying to force you to accept Beth as a parents and literally erase your mom was a doomed plan from the start, and they\u2019re facing the consequences of their actions.\n\nDon\u2019t go to therapy with them. You already know they\u2019re happy to bend the truth and manipulate others into getting their way. Beth is an adult, and her egotistical desire to be called mom is NOT your responsibility. I know it\u2019s tough to stand your ground when you\u2019re a minor and have little ground to stand on, but you got this. Stay in with your older brother since he has the firsthand experience.", "NTA your feelings and wants we're never considered. You had this woman forced on you to fulfill a desire she had. You never saw her as a mother due in part to this behavior. A real mother cares about the feelings and wants of her children above her own. She's selfish and not a \"real\" mom because she only cares about what she wants. She ruined any chance of having that bond by trying to force it on you. She and your father were cruel and the erasure of your real mother was traumatizing. It seems like all your father cares about is giving her whatever she wants no matter the cost. They didn't consider your feelings then, so you do not have to consider theirs now. This is not their decision, you are reclaiming a part of yourself that they stole from you. \n\nFollow your brothers footsteps, and get adopted by your grandparents, if that is what you want. Don't let them guilt you or this will never end. Wishing you continued strength.", "NTA. \n\nBeth had a fantasy of being a mother. She didn't seem to know or care who you were or how you felt\u2014she just tried to make you fit her fantasy, and you're under no obligation to help her with that, no matter what she thinks. \n\nIt really sucks that your dad has been on her side with this. He must be pretty desperate to be in his own happy family fantasy, too, after your mother passed away.", "NTA - are you in possession of any photos of your Mom?  You might want to hunt those down now.  I would also get in touch with the hospital you were born at to see where you can get a copy of your original, unaltered birth certificate.  They did lie in front of a judge, so that might be an avenue to delete the adoption.", "NTA. It's understandable that you and your siblings are struggling with the loss of your mother and the adoption by your father's wife, especially given the circumstances. It's your right to decide who you consider your parents and how you want to be identified legally. While it's admirable that your father and stepmother want to work on things, it's important to acknowledge that some things can't be fixed or changed with therapy. It's up to you and your siblings to decide what you want and need for yourselves moving forward.", "NTA. Your father and Beth should never have lied in order to get their own way with your adoption. That was a very poor choice of action on their part.\n\nThey had no right to try and erase your mother like that. I don't think I can comprehend how terrible that must have been for you and your brothers.\n\nYou were not unfair for telling that that it was too late for them to fix things.

I also think that individual therapy for yourself would not be a bad idea.", "NTA. I can\u2019t understand why your dad was okay with erasing your mom.

If your dad and Beth want a do-over, it should start with them petitioning the court to undo your adoption on the basis that they obtained it by lying to the court. And they should take whatever penalty goes along with admitting that. Once that's done, then you can decide how to move forward. Until then, they're not actually sorry, they just want to steamroll you and everyone else into accepting their desired outcome.", "NTA\n\nI'm not seeing how the grandparents adopting you really fixes anything. Yes Beth would be off your birth certificate but your mother would still be erased and that's something they can never fix.\n\nCould you have the adoption overturned in any way, and have your birth certificate reverted back to the original? If not then having your grandparents on it may be the best option as this birth certificate will follow you through your life and its better than what you currently have. But as far as agreeing to counseling it shouldn't be forced but I'd it's the only way you could go your brother route and give in and then cut them off once everything's sorted out.\n\nAlso the idea that your dad/Beth want the opportunity to be grandparents in the future is hysterical", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But no, it was all soured w the effort of eradicating your mother and insisting that Beth is. It's a sad situation and idk what your dad was (subconsciously or otherwise) thinking, but trying to replace the mom without first doing the emotional labour that is needed in order for the kids even think about this adoption thing was a big time mistake. Hope you will one day have a decent relationship w him as he is your dad, but first he and Beth need to acknowledge what happened and most importantly, why it was wrong.", "Hello, stepmom of 2 here. I say NTA. You guys were still processing and grieving the loss of your mother and your dad thrust this new woman upon you guys so fast it could make your head spin. This happens a lot with single dads, they immediately seek a replacement mom for their kids. They throw a lot of responsibility on this woman and a lot of pressure on the kids, leading to resentment on both sides and eventually a disaster of a relationship. I assume your stepmom wanted to adopt you guys because she was probably doing a lot of work raising you guys, school, doctor\u2019s appointments, etc and it was just easier if she was your legal mom. \n\nAnyhow, neither of them took you guys into account, they could\u2019ve let the relationship between stepmother/children progress naturally. Although my SD\u2019s have always gotten along with me, they always worshipped their mom, and I kept my distance emotionally and sometimes physically so as to not make them feel like I\u2019m trying to replace their mom. Over the years things progressed naturally, to the point that now 9 years later they are both super attached to me, and totally see me as a mom. They even reach out to me when they\u2019re with their mom. \n\nHad they listened to your boundaries, and let you guys set the pace for the relationship, maybe you guys would\u2019ve grown closer to her. But forcing things in this scenario always backfires enormously. \n\nFamily therapy is a great idea though and the therapist can help them hopefully understand where they went wrong, or at least understand how you feel and the things that triggered you the most.

We got married about 3 years later) but I still have enough respect to not do something like that. Both Beth and your dad are AH.", "NTA. They burned their bridges so thoroughly that therapy wouldn't help. The time for compromise was when you all were young, and lying had no part in that, it only destroyed trust. If anyone was unfair, it was them. What they did was cruel.", "NTA\n\nYou can't force a child to love you. They tried to erase your mother, you and your brothers took exception to that. They have no one to blame for how this turned out but themselves and there really is no way back from it.", "NTA. Oh wow, I am sorry that this has happened. From your post it sounds like Beth and your father aren't necessarily the worst, but Beth was simply incompatible with you children. As a Husband I am to put my wife first ahead of all things. If my wife died before we had children or visa versa we'd marry whomever, but now that we have children it would be the surving spouses job to find someone both that works for them and for thier kids. When your spouse dies your children become the most important priority. Finding a suitable \"mother figure\" is important yes for children's growth and development but a \"Replacement mom\" is outrageous. \n\n\nIf you wind up sharing this post with your father and Beth, I imagine this whole situation they've created would be alot different if the approach was different. A \"I know that I can never replace or erase your Mom from your life. But I do love your Father and I will love you to the best of my ability. I will strive do be there for you if you want me to be, and I will try to raise you in a way that your Mother would want you to be.\" and then years of building a relationship and work it would be different. So so different.\n\nI know this because I have a step mom, my bio mom is a narcissist who eventually abandoned me around 12, then my dad was finally able to get me into his custody. She did not force anything and we all called her ms.name or mam-name. I did know her from a few times I visited as a small child. Growing up I was filled with all kinds of lies both of them but I remember on a birthday within 3 years of them I had realized that this person really did love me as a mom should and that my bio mom was no mother at all, and I naturally just dropped the step or the name and it was just mom.\n\nI get my situation is a bit different but If she had forces the issue I gaurantee I never would have been able to come to love her or accept the truth let alone the damage that my father would have done if he forced the issue. He did insist on respect and obeying rules but they also would talk to each other and make changes as our family needed so. You really need to navigate blended famy situationa carefully. Let alone when their is grieving children.", "Info: Are your parents generally bad parents? Are they abusive? Do they generally neglect you and your siblings? Besides Beth adopting you, have they done or said anything else that indicates they are actually trying to erase your mom?", "NAH. Your dad and Beth clearly made some serious mistakes when they forced the adoption process. It\u2019s completely understandable that you and your brothers would be hurt and angry by their actions.

Family therapy is the ideal setting to get these issues on the table. Your dad probably owes you an apology. You probably could stand to have a neutral third party hear your perspective. Tell him you\u2019re not doing therapy without your brother, but that you would be willing to do family therapy.

Think long and hard before you take that advice. You\u2019re 16. You\u2019ve got a lot of growing up to do, even if you don\u2019t think you do. Your dad f*cked up in some truly spectacular ways - no question. If you truly feel like you can\u2019t do family therapy, go to individual therapy (not with your dad and Beth) and start there.

That is horrifying!", "They could have compromised with **you** by dating for an extended time without rushing into marriage \u2014 or having Beth raise you, but not replace your mother on your birth certificate.\n\nThey weren't interested in \"compromise\" when they held all the power.\n\nSo they deserve none now that you have the right to choose.\n\nYou are NTA", "If Beth wanted you and your siblings' affection she should have listened to and respected a very basic and reasonable boundary. I've always been hesitant to claim a step parent is trying to replace the parent, but this is blatant. She literally asked the government to say y'all came out of her vagina or at best redefine your mother as a surrogate, that's outrageous behavior.\n\n1,000% NTA", "NTA. Wow. Just wow. I can understand why you don't want to go therapy. They made all those changes and then decide to seek professional help when it should have been the other way around. I'd like you to consider a few things, just because most people don't know how family therapy works and it might actually benefit you so that you feel heard and validated (heard and validated at least by the therapist).\n\nDad and stepmom think family therapy is needed to make the family more cohesive. This thought is fine as family therapy can definitely lead to that. However, I'm guessing they also think it will help you agree more with their decisions and how they want the family to be. Actually, family therapy will go differently than they think. In family therapy every family member is heard and is also held accountable. Your therapist will be a neutral audience that is trained to identify dysfunction and help the family see it for themselves, and also identify the type of boundaries that are present. The therapist won't outright point these things out like \"Here's the problem and how to solve it!\", but they will use techniques that draw it out as family members share their experiences. Also, the therapist is going to identify not just the root cause of the dysfunction, but also what drives each family member, which means your dad and stepmom will have to face the role they play in the dysfunction, and the affect of their personal insecurities and trauma on the family - every member participating will come to see the role they play. Dad and stepmom are in for an awakening they aren't expecting.\n\nAnother option is a sort of compromise. You won't do family therapy but you will try individual therapy. From how your describe your family situation you and your siblings have experienced trauma. Individual therapy sounds beneficial for dad and stepmom as well. \n\nI hope this has been helpful, but don't just take my word for it. I encourage you to read up on family therapy. You might feel better about it when you know more about what you'd be participating in. \n\nIf you have a School Counselor, utilize them. I hope you have a good one.", "NTA.

And the child should be the only person who gets to erase that legal link.", "NTA when you turn 18 you can legally change your name to your mothers last name to honor her.

Have they truly acknowledged the damage they caused with their selfishness? If they haven\u2019t given a genuine apology, with genuine understanding behind it, I don\u2019t know if having a healthy relationship is possible. \n\nI hope you and your siblings the best outcome through this nightmare.\n\nEdited to add specification", "I'm so sorry if they ever made you think you were the asshole. This is such a clear cut case of NTA, but when you're constantly being told by your father that you're making a mistake, it must be hard not to turn blame to yourself. Your father and Beth made decisions about what was best for them and not for you and your brothers. Beth wanted kids, your father wanted Beth to be his wife and to just have a happy family. But they never took the interest of you and your siblings, and most importantly, they forced you guys to conform to this. If they had taken a gradual approach and thought for one second about how the death of your mom was affecting you, and not about moving on, I'm sure you would all be a lot happier.", "Honestly, the hierarchy of people who need therapy is: 1. Your step mom needs to resolve her issues and acknowledge that she may never have The experience of being a mother in the way she wants and that she can\u2019t force anyone to call her that. 2. your father needs to understand The trauma he created for his children by trying to force them to have a different mother, 3. your siblings should have individual therapy  (not in a group) to help resolve issues from losing your mother and having someone else forced on you. I don\u2019t really think family therapy will be productive until The ADULTS resolve their issues. The fact that it\u2019s SO IMPORTANT that your step mom just have you guys CALL HER mom even if there\u2019s no way that she plays that role in your lives is pretty indicative of how much therapy she needs. They are willing to pay thousands of dollars and legally relinquish their parental rights just to be called mom and dad? That\u2019s nuts!", "NTA. Therapy may be the one place in which you and your brothers have a protected, official place to state your experience of this process, and have your feelings given consideration also, instead of just your father's and Beth's feelings. You and your brothers were strong-armed, against your wishes, into another legal status. You absolutely may change this, also legally, along with any name change, and birth certificate change/correction you want to do. Therapy is for building the basis of a future relationship. For example, you would you state what you require, in order for you not to feel they are erasing your real mother. You can ask father and Beth to apologize for taking away your choice, and to repair the damage they've done.", "NTA This is incredibly awful of your father and this woman.  There was no need for her to adopt you, there\u2019s legal paperwork they could have put in place that she would be your legal guardian should something happen.  I\u2019m guessing your dad was terrified to be a father to three kids alone and found this woman who very much wanted to be a mom and so he solved his problems that way, without regard for your feelings or what you asked for.", "NTA and wow what shitty parents.", "NTA...

Now it\u2019s not just Beth that doesn\u2019t have kids. But also your dad. He should have been looking out for the three of you. He put you three first. You and your siblings lost a parent. That is horrible! I can understand why you and your siblings don\u2019t want them both in your lives. You owe Beth nothing. She went too far.

Erasing your mom is heinous and unforgivable. Get yourself emancipated and get the hell away from them", "NTA. \n\nI would suggest you go to one therapy session, with only you and the therapist. Explain the situation. Then maybe the therapist can use that to fix the two adults who clearly need the therapy.", "NTA I had a stepmom who Beth reminds me of. She wasn't trying to adopt me and my sister but she came on strong within months of marrying my dad with \"I love yous\" and ridiculous maternal behaviors that my sister and I told her and my dad from a very young age really bothered us. I one hundred percent believe this contributed to us never feeling close to her and never wanting to reciprocate \"I love you\" or call her anything other than her name. Now, my stepmom was a manipulative person in lots of ways I won't get into here, but I cannot fathom how someone can actively erase their step children's mom from their lives and their birth certificates (HOW is that even possible? She didn't birth you!) and I agree that it is too late to compromise. I felt the same way about my stepmom.Whereas, my stepdad never tried to replace my dad and never forced emotions onto us, and over years we all came to love him naturally. It makes a huge different when the stepparent is trying to force and fake a connection. It is natural to build resentment and feel spiteful. I hope you can heal from this on your own time and on your own way (solo therapy without your dad or Beth present would probably be helpful, just to unpack the impact this has had on your childhood and development) but other than this, you're not obligated to go to therapy with Beth to try and compromise. I hope there is a way to get your mom's name back on your birth certificate, but unfortunately I don't know anything about that.", "NTA. This is what happens when you try to force a situation. Why on earth they thought replacing your mother was going to turn out favorable is beyond me.", "INFO: how did Beth treat you over the years? I understand you feeling like your mom was being replaced, and it absolutely sounds like the two of them should have handled the situation much better than they did. That being said, I can also understand where a couple marrying when there are kids that young involved would think adoption was appropriate. Based on the sentiment expressed in your post, I\u2019m assuming Beth didn\u2019t turn out to be so wonderful that she won you all over, but you don\u2019t really address your relationship outside of the resentment over the initial handling, so I\u2019m just curious how things proceeded from there.

In my county, they are called the Chief Judge.  Or Honorable Chief Judge.  Anytime I was told, sorry, can\u2019t help you, I could write a letter to the Chief Judge & request what I wanted & give an explanation.  If it is logically, it has been allowed.

Maybe Beth was a bit selfish in wanting to love you all in lieu of not having had her own, but also selfless in a way to agree to take on three kids.

I think despite the name, the main *practical* purpose of a birth certificate is usually *not* to be an official document about who actually birthed you.\n\nIn cases of adoption, the original birth certificate still technically exists on file somewhere (maybe for statistical purposes?) but the record is completely sealed and replaced with the updated record. The purpose of this is pretty easy to understand \u2014 birth certificates (in my state at least) are public record. Say it was a closed adoption, where the birth mother did not want to have any contact with the child that she gave up for adoption. It would be a huge violation of her privacy if the adopted child could later go pull their birth certificate with all of her information listed.\n\nIt could also be a violation of the child\u2019s privacy if anyone could pull their birth certificate and see that the info for their bio mother and real mother didn\u2019t match up. Enrolling in school, if the birth certificate had bio parentage, would mean adoptive parents had to bring a bunch of additional paperwork to prove the adoption. Every nosy school admin person would know if a kid was adopted (in some cases before the kid themselves knew). There would probably be tons of mistakes where people\u2019s bio parents were accidentally listed as emergency contacts instead of their adoptive ones. \n\nStep-parent adoption complicates all of this reasoning a bit. But I guess you could make the argument that the court adoption process is a better place to prevent these issues, rather than changing the whole birth certificate system.", "It really is depressing how many stories like this are out there. Hell, my father and stepmother lied to try to take me from my LIVING mother. Courts didn\u2019t care how I felt about it. \n\nThey only ended up with partial custody, thank god. Why they fought so hard to take me boggles my mind, because even for the four days a month I was with them, I was mostly alone.\n\nSome people shouldn\u2019t have kids. But they do. And then they get to make power plays for 18 years, at least.", "The point was, a copy from the state birth registry is something else. I understand they have to keep one with the original bio parents on there to make sure nobody unknowingly marries a sibling.", "At least in my state, all adoptions are legally required to have some sort of social worker investigation\u2014for example, I have a lot of clients who are same-sex couples and had a child using a sperm donor, and even then they still need what\u2019s called a post-placement report.", "In my state, it\u2019s the state.", "Can I ask why? You're genuinely the very first adoptee I've ever encountered with this opinion, and I'm 52 and have been in adoptee circles for a bit. Most have a very deep seated need to know about our origins. I am of course aware I've not met every adoptee ever and maybe I've just been in limited groups. \n\nBut, do you actually want that information kept from all of us? I'm not trying to be confrontational, I'd like to understand.", "There's a actually a lot of us who don't have any desire to know that.  As in, my experience over the last 55 years is I only know one person who wanted that information.\n\nWhy?  Privacy.  But, it depends on what you actually mean?  Medical info/history?  Sure, no problem.  Actual names?  Pretty problematic, because that info opens the possibility of contact, and that is pretty iffy.  No, are you asking that only you get access to records, or do bio family have that option, too?\n\nWhat if your bio parents don't want to have contact, what if their current family has no idea they gave a child up?  And, for the other side, having bio parents want contact when you don't?  Or when you didn't expect it?  That's a lot of stress.\n\nI want controls on that information, I don't want it to be an easy impulse kind of thing.  So, it's not that it should never be available, it's that it shouldn't be wide open.\n\nI mean, are you saying you want us all exposed to the chance of involuntary contact, or bio-parents to face that?", "If you can't handle your partner's past, then you don't marry him.  But you do not take your insecurities out on his child.", "NTA, but what bugs me most is that Beth played herself SO HARD. If they had just married each other and parented you guys on regular terms y'all probably would have built a healthy enough relationship. But nooo, they went and forced it in the most egregiously inappropriate way possible. Impaled upon their own sword. Shakin my dang head.", "NTA. We don't go to therapy to make some one love us. That's just nonsense!   \nAnd I hope that people start to understand that you can't force love. I had never seem any story that some stepparent forced themselves to the kids and it worked. Maybe there are some stories, but I had never seem here on reddit.", "NTA. Sad thing is Beth shot her chance of being a \u201cmother\u201d in the foot when she just showed up and went along with/ was the driving force of the erasure of your actual mother.  \n\nI don\u2019t blame any of you all for how you feel towards her or your dad because they royally screwed up and they are only interested in trying to fix things to preserve her dream of \u201cbeing a mother\u201d not actually repair the emotional damage they inflicted.", "NTA - every story I read on here about stepparents and stepchildren having problems, it's because the adults try to force the children to see the new parent as \"Mom\" or \"Dad\".  Every time.  \n\nIf they hadn't tried to replace your mother, and if Beth had been presented as another adult who would love and support you, it may have been possible for you to form a relationship.\n\nInsisting that she be your mother is nothing more than ego.  It wasn't what was best for the kids, and she and your father didn't care what you wanted.", "YTA, your father tried to have a parent for you.  He found a step mother. She didn\u2019t kill your mom.  You have mentioned nothing of abuse or anything. Just you resent that your dad remarried and you feel being adopted by your step mother is some huge insult to your mother who died. You were really young children so of course being adopted by his new wife makes sense.   It\u2019s normal.  I think counseling would be a good idea because this amount of resentment isn\u2019t healthy and doesn\u2019t make sense.  This woman has been taking care of you three longer than your mother was able to.  Unless she was abusive I really don\u2019t understand this resentment.", "NTA\n\nWhat your father and his wife did to you was deplorable.\n\nIs it more important to you to have a birth certificate with your moms name on it than to get Beth\u2019s name off? I\u2019m pretty sure that your state would still have a copy of your original birth certificate. That\u2019s where I would start. They might even be able to guide you towards what steps you would have to take.\n\nIf the state can\u2019t help, ask your grandparents or extended family to help you find out what you can or can\u2019t do. \n\nBy trying to erase your mother, your father and Beth tried to force you to do the same. There\u2019s no way to know how you might have grown to feel about Beth had they not done that. \n\nAbout pictures of your mother. If whoever has them, would scan them for you and put them on a flash drive you would have them to look at and to print and frame.", "Only post that makes sense. OP is 16 years old, and seems to have a perfect memory from when they were 5 and 6. Teenagers have a way of blowing events way out of proportion, and always go through a moment of \"hating\" their parents.", "your question has been asked by others and op answered in comments", "read the comments", "Adoptions almost always result in a changed birth certificate, a holdover from days where the default assumption was that the birth mother would never want to be found or that it was best to simply establish the new parents as the only family. And in some terrible cases, it might be safest for the child to not find or be found by the previous parent. But adoptees have been speaking up about this; for some, they find it frustrating to have no way to reach someone who could tell them a medical history or about their biological family history and others, like OP, don\u2019t like that a family member(s) they loved were erased.", "Sometimes internet people are smart and other times they\u2019re a bunch of zombies.", "I did, and saw you projecting with every response.", "They don't just want the name.  They want Beth out of their lives, and possibly their father as well, at this point.\n\nIf the kids were to have kids of their own, and something happened to them and their partner/co-parent, as grandparents, Beth and the father would be high on the list for a CPS worker or court looking for someone to take care of the kids. \n\nA legal adoption would address this concern, as it not only creates a tie to the adoptive parents, it breaks ties to the other parents.", "They probably did it to hurt your mom. And that's just sad to put your kid through something like that to get back at your ex, Not caring about your kids feelings. I'm sorry you had to go through that.", "As the grandparents adopted the brother, and clearly stated that the maternal family would be willing to take care of them, the argument for fraud could be made as the adoption only went through due to their lies. Since they committed perjury, in theory they could be in legal trouble for that too. This might be something to bring up. Beth can either terminate her rights or you\u2019ll pursue termination due to fraud and perjury. Maybe she\u2019ll cut her losses if facing jail time.", "I'd tell them that it was the only way any of you could entertain the possibility of forgiveness. I'm not saying you would, at all, but it would be good to throw out there so they know exactly how impossible what they want of you is.\n\nTo my mind, what they did was unforgivable. NTA", "If you are in a state that allows one party consent recording, you and your brothers could record a conversation with your dad and Beth admitting they lied about not having family to care for you. Then have the siblings verify that your dad and Beth were the people speaking (unless you can catch them on video). Basically tricking them into confessing", "Sounds like they just want to have grand children, since they screwed up your lives.  Didn't know a birth certificate could be changed.  The birth mother would always be the birth mother, for vital records.", "Are OP's grandparents willing to take them in now?\n\nWhile technically the kids would be running away, courts and the police tend not to want to intervene if the kids are with a responsible, related adult.", "These stories are always so ironic. If she hadn't pushed her way into their lives, maybe they could have grown to appreciate and love her as a maternal figure (even if not a mom specifically). Instead they do the one thing garunteed to make sure that the exact opposite will happen.", "Why is it irrelevant?  It says a lot, in my opinion, about the father\u2019s respect for his children\u2019s grief over the loss of their mother. It also speaks to his love and dedication to his wife and the mother of his children.  I just don\u2019t understand moving on so quickly.  The only things that make sense to me is either 1)making an irrational decision due to overwhelming grief to find something to distract from the pain and loneliness or 2) desperation to find help caring for one\u2019s children because you feel unable to do it by yourself.  I can have empathy for the person making these decisions but neither is a good decision and neither is particularly healthy.", "They won\u2019t because lying to the court is a criminal offense (perjury). It\u2019s a felony in my jurisdiction, punishable with prison time. No attorney would ever advise them to do this.", "I can\u2019t imagine a more appropriate use of therapy. \n\nAdoption 120000% makes sense. What if dad dies they could go to foster home. I can\u2019t wait until these kids grow up and realize what brats they were.\n\nBut no Reddit hates stepparents and takes OPs word as Bible so you know how that goes\u2026 \n\nEventually you grow up and realize your parents are people too doing the best they can. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with stepmother adopting OP or wanting them to go to therapy. They could use it! \n\nYTA", "I saw it too!!", "beyond sad your mom is an always will be. Beth should have built a relationship with you all doesn't deserve to have any standing at all.", "Is there any way you can move in with your maternal grandparents now, even if they can't legally adopt you?\n\nIt would get you away from this toxic situation.\n\nAnd if your father and Beth try to come after you a \"runaway,\" whomever is investigating will see that you are in the care of responsible, related adults, and they're unlikely to try to force older teens to go back home from a safe place, or the kids might run away for real, trying to hide from their parents and the authorities, and wind up in danger on the street.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it is divorce or death of a parent/spouse, in these situations, the parents will do what is best and easiest for them, while telling themselves, their kids, and others that they are acting in the best interest of the child.  Joint custody?  The parents, who caused the mess, get to live comfortably in their own homes, while the kids are forced to live like nomads, bouncing between houses but without a full-time place to call home. Remarriage?  The parent gets the new spouse they want.  The kids get a new housemate not of their choosing, with no say in the matter.\n\nIf your maternal grandparents are willing to advocate for you now, and take you in, see if you can arrange a safe haven with them, even if a formal legal adoption has to wait.  A peaceful place to live and call home, without the toxic pressure of living with people trying to erase you past and half of whom you are, will do a world of good for restoring peace in your mind.", "Good for him. Therapy isn't some magical pill that cures any ailment. Most people don't need therapy. Your brother knows what happened and he knows how he feels about it.", "I don\u2019t think it would make it better at all but has anyone pointed out to her that this was all about her needs, not yours, and that that\u2019s really at the heart of why you\u2019re all so angry and feel so betrayed?", "Your proof would be signed and notarized affidavits from as many relatives as you can find stating that they were always willing to take you in if something happened to your father, and any statements made to the contrary were false.

They want to wipe them out of their lives the same way Beth and Dad tried to wipe out their mom.", "Thank you for saying that. You\u2019re right. Also, apologies for kinda trauma dumping on your comment!"]}
