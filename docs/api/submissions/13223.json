It felt like they had known each other about a month when they got married but it possible they were together longer. About a month after mom died dad was in a widows and widowers group and that's how he met his wife, Beth. Beth lost her husband and had no kids. When they got married they sat us down and told us Beth was going to adopt us. My older brother and I objected. But we were ignored. Around that time we heard some extended family try to talk them out of it as well, saying we would be taken care of if anything happened to our father, no need to go through with the adoption. Beth told them she was our mother now and the adoption needed to happen. We spoke to a social worker and the judge before the adoption happened. Initially their request was rejected based on our conversations. But then they came up with a story that we'd have nobody else to take care of us and our family had already said they wouldn't raise us if anything happened to dad and it was done.\n\nOlder brother and I never liked it, younger brother didn't really no any better but by age 7 was saying he wished he wasn't adopted as well. He could have been copying us. But he says he really feels that way so...\n\nWe have new birth certificates ever since the adoption and her name is in the place of mother. Found that out when I gave my mom's name in school one day and had to bring in my birth certificate and saw Beth's name. My brothers had no idea that had happened either. It pissed off my older brother so much that he told Beth he hoped she would die and we could be adopted again since she was far more replaceable than mom. That incident made Beth and our father put him into  therapy with them. That lasted for two years until he moved out last year. He then asked our maternal grandparents to adopt him since he couldn't find a way to reverse the adoption.\n\nRecently Beth and my father have figured out that I want to do the same and so does my younger brother. Beth broke down and said she just wanted the chance to be a mother and wanted us to love her back. My father suggested they do therapy with me and my brother (separate sessions with each of us) and that we try to work out a compromise. I told him it was too late for that. They already erased mom and nothing they could say would make me feel different about what they did. I told Beth we were never her children and she would need to accept the fact she was never going to be loved back. My father told me that wasn't true.

It just sounds like he wanted to get a replacement mom in the door as quickly as possibly so the family could regain a semblance of normalcy, but in the process he prioritized Beth\u2019s agenda over his kids\u2019 feelings and wellbeing. Mother-child bonds and love can\u2019t be forced, and this is what he tried to do.", "NTA\n\nWhile you are very young, as others have pointed out, your youth doesn\u2019t invalidate your feelings. Rather than engage in family therapy, which is a huge ask since so much has been thrust upon you in so short a period of time, consider requesting therapy on your own. A therapist may be able to help you start sorting through your feelings and developing strategies to deal with your situation now - and on your parents dime - rather than letting all this fester inside you through early adulthood.\n\nYou\u2019re already doing an awesome job of expressing your feelings and intentions and knowing your worth! \ud83d\udc4a\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - The timeline between your dad meeting Beth and marrying her is irrelevant, them trying to force you to accept Beth as a parents and literally erase your mom was a doomed plan from the start, and they\u2019re facing the consequences of their actions.\n\nDon\u2019t go to therapy with them. You already know they\u2019re happy to bend the truth and manipulate others into getting their way. Beth is an adult, and her egotistical desire to be called mom is NOT your responsibility. I know it\u2019s tough to stand your ground when you\u2019re a minor and have little ground to stand on, but you got this. Stay in with your older brother since he has the firsthand experience.", "NTA your feelings and wants we're never considered. You had this woman forced on you to fulfill a desire she had. You never saw her as a mother due in part to this behavior. A real mother cares about the feelings and wants of her children above her own. She's selfish and not a \"real\" mom because she only cares about what she wants. She ruined any chance of having that bond by trying to force it on you. She and your father were cruel and the erasure of your real mother was traumatizing. It seems like all your father cares about is giving her whatever she wants no matter the cost. They didn't consider your feelings then, so you do not have to consider theirs now. This is not their decision, you are reclaiming a part of yourself that they stole from you. \n\nFollow your brothers footsteps, and get adopted by your grandparents, if that is what you want. Don't let them guilt you or this will never end. Wishing you continued strength.", "NTA. \n\nBeth had a fantasy of being a mother. She didn't seem to know or care who you were or how you felt\u2014she just tried to make you fit her fantasy, and you're under no obligation to help her with that, no matter what she thinks. \n\nIt really sucks that your dad has been on her side with this. He must be pretty desperate to be in his own happy family fantasy, too, after your mother passed away.", "NTA - are you in possession of any photos of your Mom?  You might want to hunt those down now.  I would also get in touch with the hospital you were born at to see where you can get a copy of your original, unaltered birth certificate.  They did lie in front of a judge, so that might be an avenue to delete the adoption.", "NTA. It's understandable that you and your siblings are struggling with the loss of your mother and the adoption by your father's wife, especially given the circumstances. It's your right to decide who you consider your parents and how you want to be identified legally. While it's admirable that your father and stepmother want to work on things, it's important to acknowledge that some things can't be fixed or changed with therapy. It's up to you and your siblings to decide what you want and need for yourselves moving forward.", "NTA. Your father and Beth should never have lied in order to get their own way with your adoption. That was a very poor choice of action on their part.\n\nThey had no right to try and erase your mother like that. I don't think I can comprehend how terrible that must have been for you and your brothers.\n\nYou were not unfair for telling that that it was too late for them to fix things. Actions have consequences, and this is the consequence of theirs.\n\nI hope your maternal grandparents are able to adopt you. I also think that individual therapy for yourself would not be a bad idea.", "NTA. I can\u2019t understand why your dad was okay with erasing your mom. You guys might have come to care for her if they hadn\u2019t tried to obliterate your mom\u2019s memory. I think they need therapy. \n\nStay strong sweetheart. Your mom would want you to.", "NTA.

Bad circumstances don't always excuse bad actions and this is a case of that. Lying to the court? Not listening to OP and then making yourself \"mom\" against their will?

If your dad and Beth want a do-over, it should start with them petitioning the court to undo your adoption on the basis that they obtained it by lying to the court. And they should take whatever penalty goes along with admitting that. Once that's done, then you can decide how to move forward. Until then, they're not actually sorry, they just want to steamroll you and everyone else into accepting their desired outcome.", "NTA\n\nI'm not seeing how the grandparents adopting you really fixes anything. Yes Beth would be off your birth certificate but your mother would still be erased and that's something they can never fix.\n\nCould you have the adoption overturned in any way, and have your birth certificate reverted back to the original? If not then having your grandparents on it may be the best option as this birth certificate will follow you through your life and its better than what you currently have. But as far as agreeing to counseling it shouldn't be forced but I'd it's the only way you could go your brother route and give in and then cut them off once everything's sorted out.\n\nAlso the idea that your dad/Beth want the opportunity to be grandparents in the future is hysterical", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, Beth will never be your mother, but had she and your dad respected your and your brothers' feelings, she still could have had an important and good relationship w you guys. But no, it was all soured w the effort of eradicating your mother and insisting that Beth is. It's a sad situation and idk what your dad was (subconsciously or otherwise) thinking, but trying to replace the mom without first doing the emotional labour that is needed in order for the kids even think about this adoption thing was a big time mistake. Hope you will one day have a decent relationship w him as he is your dad, but first he and Beth need to acknowledge what happened and most importantly, why it was wrong.", "Hello, stepmom of 2 here. I say NTA. You guys were still processing and grieving the loss of your mother and your dad thrust this new woman upon you guys so fast it could make your head spin. This happens a lot with single dads, they immediately seek a replacement mom for their kids. They throw a lot of responsibility on this woman and a lot of pressure on the kids, leading to resentment on both sides and eventually a disaster of a relationship. I assume your stepmom wanted to adopt you guys because she was probably doing a lot of work raising you guys, school, doctor\u2019s appointments, etc and it was just easier if she was your legal mom. \n\nAnyhow, neither of them took you guys into account, they could\u2019ve let the relationship between stepmother/children progress naturally. Although my SD\u2019s have always gotten along with me, they always worshipped their mom, and I kept my distance emotionally and sometimes physically so as to not make them feel like I\u2019m trying to replace their mom. Over the years things progressed naturally, to the point that now 9 years later they are both super attached to me, and totally see me as a mom. They even reach out to me when they\u2019re with their mom. \n\nHad they listened to your boundaries, and let you guys set the pace for the relationship, maybe you guys would\u2019ve grown closer to her. But forcing things in this scenario always backfires enormously. \n\nFamily therapy is a great idea though and the therapist can help them hopefully understand where they went wrong, or at least understand how you feel and the things that triggered you the most.

We got married about 3 years later) but I still have enough respect to not do something like that. Both Beth and your dad are AH.", "NTA. They burned their bridges so thoroughly that therapy wouldn't help. The time for compromise was when you all were young, and lying had no part in that, it only destroyed trust. If anyone was unfair, it was them. What they did was cruel.", "NTA\n\nYou can't force a child to love you. They tried to erase your mother, you and your brothers took exception to that. They have no one to blame for how this turned out but themselves and there really is no way back from it.", "NTA. Oh wow, I am sorry that this has happened. From your post it sounds like Beth and your father aren't necessarily the worst, but Beth was simply incompatible with you children. As a Husband I am to put my wife first ahead of all things. If my wife died before we had children or visa versa we'd marry whomever, but now that we have children it would be the surving spouses job to find someone both that works for them and for thier kids. When your spouse dies your children become the most important priority. Finding a suitable \"mother figure\" is important yes for children's growth and development but a \"Replacement mom\" is outrageous. \n\n\nIf you wind up sharing this post with your father and Beth, I imagine this whole situation they've created would be alot different if the approach was different. A \"I know that I can never replace or erase your Mom from your life. But I do love your Father and I will love you to the best of my ability. I will strive do be there for you if you want me to be, and I will try to raise you in a way that your Mother would want you to be.\" and then years of building a relationship and work it would be different. So so different.\n\nI know this because I have a step mom, my bio mom is a narcissist who eventually abandoned me around 12, then my dad was finally able to get me into his custody. She did not force anything and we all called her ms.name or mam-name. I did know her from a few times I visited as a small child. Growing up I was filled with all kinds of lies both of them but I remember on a birthday within 3 years of them I had realized that this person really did love me as a mom should and that my bio mom was no mother at all, and I naturally just dropped the step or the name and it was just mom.\n\nI get my situation is a bit different but If she had forces the issue I gaurantee I never would have been able to come to love her or accept the truth let alone the damage that my father would have done if he forced the issue. He did insist on respect and obeying rules but they also would talk to each other and make changes as our family needed so. You really need to navigate blended famy situationa carefully. Let alone when their is grieving children.", "Info: Are your parents generally bad parents? Are they abusive? Do they generally neglect you and your siblings? Besides Beth adopting you, have they done or said anything else that indicates they are actually trying to erase your mom?", "NAH. Your dad and Beth clearly made some serious mistakes when they forced the adoption process. It\u2019s completely understandable that you and your brothers would be hurt and angry by their actions. I\u2019m guessing that the replacement of your mother\u2019s name with Beth\u2019s on the birth certificates wasn\u2019t something your dad/Beth asked for, it was just how the government does that - which sucks, by the way. Here\u2019s the thing: Your dad is married to Beth. He\u2019s the only dad you have. You haven\u2019t really said anything about Beth herself here\u2026only that she showed up awfully soon after your mothers death and that you were ignored when you said you didn\u2019t want her to adopt you. Family therapy is the ideal setting to get these issues on the table. Your dad probably owes you an apology. You probably could stand to have a neutral third party hear your perspective. Tell him you\u2019re not doing therapy without your brother, but that you would be willing to do family therapy. I\u2019m sorry, this is clearly a tough situation for everyone.\nEdited to add: OP, I\u2019m guessing that a lot of the comments you\u2019re getting here, telling you NTA and \u201ccut ties\u201d with your dad are from other teenagers. Think long and hard before you take that advice. You\u2019re 16. You\u2019ve got a lot of growing up to do, even if you don\u2019t think you do. Your dad f*cked up in some truly spectacular ways - no question. If you truly feel like you can\u2019t do family therapy, go to individual therapy (not with your dad and Beth) and start there.

Actually, family therapy will go differently than they think. In family therapy every family member is heard and is also held accountable. Your therapist will be a neutral audience that is trained to identify dysfunction and help the family see it for themselves, and also identify the type of boundaries that are present. The therapist won't outright point these things out like \"Here's the problem and how to solve it!\", but they will use techniques that draw it out as family members share their experiences. Also, the therapist is going to identify not just the root cause of the dysfunction, but also what drives each family member, which means your dad and stepmom will have to face the role they play in the dysfunction, and the affect of their personal insecurities and trauma on the family - every member participating will come to see the role they play. Dad and stepmom are in for an awakening they aren't expecting.\n\nAnother option is a sort of compromise. You won't do family therapy but you will try individual therapy. From how your describe your family situation you and your siblings have experienced trauma. Individual therapy sounds beneficial for dad and stepmom as well. \n\nI hope this has been helpful, but don't just take my word for it. I encourage you to read up on family therapy. You might feel better about it when you know more about what you'd be participating in. \n\nIf you have a School Counselor, utilize them. I hope you have a good one.", "NTA. Beth and your dad are assholes and idiots at best. That said, I personally would try to go to therapy, at least with your dad without Beth.", "NTA\n \nSounds like a fraudulent adoption but IANAL.

People may tell you to give family a chance, but by no means is that a requirement.", "NTA\n \nSounds like a fraudulent adoption but IANAL.

Have they truly acknowledged the damage they caused with their selfishness? If they haven\u2019t given a genuine apology, with genuine understanding behind it, I don\u2019t know if having a healthy relationship is possible. \n\nI hope you and your siblings the best outcome through this nightmare.\n\nEdited to add specification", "I'm so sorry if they ever made you think you were the asshole. This is such a clear cut case of NTA, but when you're constantly being told by your father that you're making a mistake, it must be hard not to turn blame to yourself. Your father and Beth made decisions about what was best for them and not for you and your brothers. Beth wanted kids, your father wanted Beth to be his wife and to just have a happy family. But they never took the interest of you and your siblings, and most importantly, they forced you guys to conform to this. If they had taken a gradual approach and thought for one second about how the death of your mom was affecting you, and not about moving on, I'm sure you would all be a lot happier.", "Honestly, the hierarchy of people who need therapy is: 1. Your step mom needs to resolve her issues and acknowledge that she may never have The experience of being a mother in the way she wants and that she can\u2019t force anyone to call her that. 2. your father needs to understand The trauma he created for his children by trying to force them to have a different mother, 3. your siblings should have individual therapy  (not in a group) to help resolve issues from losing your mother and having someone else forced on you. I don\u2019t really think family therapy will be productive until The ADULTS resolve their issues. The fact that it\u2019s SO IMPORTANT that your step mom just have you guys CALL HER mom even if there\u2019s no way that she plays that role in your lives is pretty indicative of how much therapy she needs. They are willing to pay thousands of dollars and legally relinquish their parental rights just to be called mom and dad? That\u2019s nuts!", "NTA. Therapy may be the one place in which you and your brothers have a protected, official place to state your experience of this process, and have your feelings given consideration also, instead of just your father's and Beth's feelings.

You absolutely may change this, also legally, along with any name change, and birth certificate change/correction you want to do. Therapy is for building the basis of a future relationship. For example, you would you state what you require, in order for you not to feel they are erasing your real mother. You can ask father and Beth to apologize for taking away your choice, and to repair the damage they've done.", "NTA This is incredibly awful of your father and this woman.  There was no need for her to adopt you, there\u2019s legal paperwork they could have put in place that she would be your legal guardian should something happen.

She wasn't trying to adopt me and my sister but she came on strong within months of marrying my dad with \"I love yous\" and ridiculous maternal behaviors that my sister and I told her and my dad from a very young age really bothered us. I one hundred percent believe this contributed to us never feeling close to her and never wanting to reciprocate \"I love you\" or call her anything other than her name. Now, my stepmom was a manipulative person in lots of ways I won't get into here, but I cannot fathom how someone can actively erase their step children's mom from their lives and their birth certificates (HOW is that even possible? She didn't birth you!) and I agree that it is too late to compromise. I felt the same way about my stepmom.Whereas, my stepdad never tried to replace my dad and never forced emotions onto us, and over years we all came to love him naturally. It makes a huge different when the stepparent is trying to force and fake a connection. It is natural to build resentment and feel spiteful. I hope you can heal from this on your own time and on your own way (solo therapy without your dad or Beth present would probably be helpful, just to unpack the impact this has had on your childhood and development) but other than this, you're not obligated to go to therapy with Beth to try and compromise.

Based on the sentiment expressed in your post, I\u2019m assuming Beth didn\u2019t turn out to be so wonderful that she won you all over, but you don\u2019t really address your relationship outside of the resentment over the initial handling, so I\u2019m just curious how things proceeded from there.

No government keeps them, only the amended version. There's also not some \"certificate of adoption\" like for a cabbage patch doll. The new birth certificate is where the new name and parents names are recorded. Somewhere there are sealed court records of the proceedings, and the AParents might get something like that - mine had a document in legaleze talking about \"finalizing the matter\" but it in no way resembled a certificate of any kind.

I dont have empathy for people who do these things and then continue to force the children to feed their happy family delusion that they want. \n\nYou can have empathy but that doesnt mean what they did gets a pass because of grief.
