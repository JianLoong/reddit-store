When they got married they sat us down and told us Beth was going to adopt us. My older brother and I objected. But we were ignored. Around that time we heard some extended family try to talk them out of it as well, saying we would be taken care of if anything happened to our father, no need to go through with the adoption. Beth told them she was our mother now and the adoption needed to happen. We spoke to a social worker and the judge before the adoption happened. Initially their request was rejected based on our conversations. But then they came up with a story that we'd have nobody else to take care of us and our family had already said they wouldn't raise us if anything happened to dad and it was done.\n\nOlder brother and I never liked it, younger brother didn't really no any better but by age 7 was saying he wished he wasn't adopted as well.

A therapist may be able to help you start sorting through your feelings and developing strategies to deal with your situation now - and on your parents dime - rather than letting all this fester inside you through early adulthood.\n\nYou\u2019re already doing an awesome job of expressing your feelings and intentions and knowing your worth! \ud83d\udc4a\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - The timeline between your dad meeting Beth and marrying her is irrelevant, them trying to force you to accept Beth as a parents and literally erase your mom was a doomed plan from the start, and they\u2019re facing the consequences of their actions.\n\nDon\u2019t go to therapy with them. You already know they\u2019re happy to bend the truth and manipulate others into getting their way. Beth is an adult, and her egotistical desire to be called mom is NOT your responsibility.

Stay in with your older brother since he has the firsthand experience.", "NTA your feelings and wants we're never considered. You had this woman forced on you to fulfill a desire she had. You never saw her as a mother due in part to this behavior. A real mother cares about the feelings and wants of her children above her own. She's selfish and not a \"real\" mom because she only cares about what she wants. She ruined any chance of having that bond by trying to force it on you. She and your father were cruel and the erasure of your real mother was traumatizing. It seems like all your father cares about is giving her whatever she wants no matter the cost. They didn't consider your feelings then so you do not have to consider theirs now.

He must be pretty desperate to be in his own happy family fantasy, too, after your mother passed away.", "NTA - are you in possession of any photos of your Mom?  You might want to hunt those down now.  I would also get in touch with the hospital you were born at to see where you can get a copy of your original, unaltered birth certificate.  They did lie in front of a judge, so that might be an avenue to delete the adoption.", "NTA. It's understandable that you and your siblings are struggling with the loss of your mother and the adoption by your father's wife, especially given the circumstances. It's your right to decide who you consider your parents and how you want to be identified legally. While it's admirable that your father and stepmother want to work on things, it's important to acknowledge that some things can't be fixed or changed with therapy. It's up to you and your siblings to decide what you want and need for yourselves moving forward.", "NTA. Your father and Beth should never have lied in order to get their own way with your adoption.

Until then, they're not actually sorry, they just want to steamroll you and everyone else into accepting their desired outcome.", "NTA\n\nI'm not seeing how the grandparents adopting you really fixes anything.

If not then having your grandparents on it may be the best option as this birth certificate will follow you through your life and its better than what you currently have. But as far as agreeing to counseling it shouldn't be forced but I'd it's the only way you could go your brother route and give in and then cut them off once everything's sorted out.\n\nAlso the idea that your dad/Beth want the opportunity to be grandparents in the future is hysterical", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I say NTA. You guys were still processing and grieving the loss of your mother and your dad thrust this new woman upon you guys so fast it could make your head spin. This happens a lot with single dads, they immediately seek a replacement mom for their kids. They throw a lot of responsibility on this woman and a lot of pressure on the kids, leading to resentment on both sides and eventually a disaster of a relationship. I assume your stepmom wanted to adopt you guys because she was probably doing a lot of work raising you guys, school, doctor\u2019s appointments, etc and it was just easier if she was your legal mom. \n\nAnyhow, neither of them took you guys into account, they could\u2019ve let the relationship between stepmother/children progress naturally. Although my SD\u2019s have always gotten along with me, they always worshipped their mom, and I kept my distance emotionally and sometimes physically so as to not make them feel like I\u2019m trying to replace their mom. Over the years things progressed naturally, to the point that now 9 years later they are both super attached to me, and totally see me as a mom. They even reach out to me when they\u2019re with their mom. \n\nHad they listened to your boundaries, and let you guys set the pace for the relationship, maybe you guys would\u2019ve grown closer to her. But forcing things in this scenario always backfires enormously. \n\nFamily therapy is a great idea though and the therapist can help them hopefully understand where they went wrong, or at least understand how you feel and the things that triggered you the most.

We got married about 3 years later) but I still have enough respect to not do something like that. Both Beth and your dad are AH.", "NTA. They burned their bridges so thoroughly that therapy wouldn't help. The time for compromise was when you all were young, and lying had no part in that, it only destroyed trust. If anyone was unfair, it was them. What they did was cruel.", "NTA\n\nYou can't force a child to love you. They tried to erase your mother, you and your brothers took exception to that. They have no one to blame for how this turned out but themselves and there really is no way back from it.", "NTA. Oh wow, I am sorry that this has happened. From your post it sounds like Beth and your father aren't necessarily the worst, but Beth was simply incompatible with you children. As a Husband I am to put my wife first ahead of all things. If my wife died before we had children or visa versa we'd marry whomever, but now that we have children it would be the surving spouses job to find someone both that works for them and for thier kids. When your spouse dies your children become the most important priority. Finding a suitable \"mother figure\" is important yes for children's growth and development but a \"Replacement mom\" is outrageous. \n\n\nIf you wind up sharing this post with your father and Beth, I imagine this whole situation they've created would be alot different if the approach was different. A \"I know that I can never replace or erase your Mom from your life. But I do love your Father and I will love you to the best of my ability. I will strive do be there for you if you want me to be, and I will try to raise you in a way that your Mother would want you to be.\" and then years of building a relationship and work it would be different. So so different.\n\nI know this because I have a step mom, my bio mom is a narcissist who eventually abandoned me around 12, then my dad was finally able to get me into his custody. She did not force anything and we all called her ms.name or mam-name. I did know her from a few times I visited as a small child. Growing up I was filled with all kinds of lies both of them but I remember on a birthday within 3 years of them I had realized that this person really did love me as a mom should and that my bio mom was no mother at all, and I naturally just dropped the step or the name and it was just mom.\n\nI get my situation is a bit different but If she had forces the issue I gaurantee I never would have been able to come to love her or accept the truth let alone the damage that my father would have done if he forced the issue. He did insist on respect and obeying rules but they also would talk to each other and make changes as our family needed so. You really need to navigate blended famy situationa carefully. Let alone when their is grieving children.", "Info: Are your parents generally bad parents? Are they abusive? Do they generally neglect you and your siblings?

They're young, grieving, emotional, and here's their dad saying to the court that if anything happens to him, these kids become wards of the state unless they let this adoption go through. \n\n\nFrankly, that's the thing the state cares about the most. They just don't want to be responsible for the kids.", "I\u2019m guessing you are right. But wouldn\u2019t it be possible the school or somewhere have one? I\u2019m trying to think of where all you have to give birth certificates.", "wtf thats just wrong and illegal. his dad was still alive and they got him adopted to step dad\n\nedit why not update the birth certificate?", "Would it be worth the effort of adult adoption? Like getting his biodad to adopt him back? \n\nI guess that's assuming biodad is still with us? \n\nSorry if that's asking more info than you want to share.", "That is incredible. I can\u2019t imagine the challenges you have faced. It\u2019s wonderful you are there for the kids. I know the child doesn\u2019t understand everything now, but they will come to really appreciate what you\u2019ve done for them. It takes a special kind of person to put themselves in a high risk situation. I applaud your willingness to help. Hugs and take care.", "That's the compromise they offered me and my younger brother. Since my older brother wants nothing to do with them. They were like grandparents can be parents on paper, just acknowledge us as your parents.", "still though your logic is really skewed and minimizes what happened to OP. None of what her father did was needed, It wasnt just her grandparents who were telling him not to do it but other family members. He did this for the stepmom to be a \"mom\". \n\nAlso i dont understand how you think the stepmom is nice when she forces them to refer to her as their mom?", "You really need to reread the post and OPs comments cause you dont seem to understand whats actually going on even when OP responds to you", ">They call Beth our mom all the time. They don't honor or acknowledge our mom at all. They're not abusive but they fucked up in a seriously unforgivable way (for me).\n\nThis was literally the comment from OP that you responded to. and this is a link to a comment thread where they ask about pictures of their mom \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122l0h5/aita\\_for\\_telling\\_my\\_father\\_and\\_his\\_wife\\_that\\_its/jdqrw2m/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122l0h5/aita_for_telling_my_father_and_his_wife_that_its/jdqrw2m/?context=3)\n\nI really dont understand how you dont see what the father did as wrong even when OP tells you in a comment to your question.", "Because they're forcing the kids to call Beth \"mom\" and placed her name on the birth certificate even though she's not the mom.... you don't understand because you lack basic English comprehension skills.", "You can probably order one from the government of wherever the child was born. I was adopted and I have two birth certificates, one with original name and info and one with adoptive name and info (adoptive parents changed my first and last name)", "Good point. I think my parents had to provide a copy of the birth certificates when they had to enroll me in school for the first time (pre-K I think) but afterwards they only had to provide Transfer Certificate when I had to change school/college.\n\nMaybe they have the certificate scanned and uploaded in the school system?", "But your brother doesnt acknowledge your dad and step mom as parents though right?", "Does she literally tell them to call her \"mom\"? Or is she just using the term \"mom\" in public settings explaining their relationship? For example, my sister is technically her step son's mom, and might refer to herself as such if someone were to ask her, but between the two of them, he calls her \"Mimi\" and reserves the name \"mom\" for his birth mom, and both my sister and her son are fine with this arrangement", "That would be great. I hope OP can locate one. I know I\u2019d want it.", "Yes, that's right. That's why they wanted my younger brother and I to do it.", "Your purposuly being obtuse now and OP has told you that she makes them call her mom and she wasnt being ambiguous and given how her father wants the stepmom as new mom its pretty clear she makes them refer to her as mom. \n\nOP has also said in other comments that they refuse to acknowledge their late mother. \n\nSeriously you need to reread the post and OPs comments before you comment again cause your asking questions that have been asked and answered.", "\u201cYour emotional needs as parents are not my responsibility to unpack and compensate for. Insisting on legally changing the nature of our relationship to fill your needs at an emotional cost to young children who had just lost their mother is horrible. Insisting publicly in court that our loving extended family wouldn\u2019t care for us when you had been told the exact opposite is atrocious, especially since it was done to overrule our wishes. \nYou two need therapy on your own to understand why one of the consequences of your \u201cparenting\u201d choices, is that I may never consider you my parents.\u201d\n\nYou are SOOOO NTA. \nIf you want to give them direction and are open to it yourself:\n\u201cIf you want any relationship with me in the future, including any contact with future grandchildren, you need to stop focusing on titles and your own emotional wants and focus on building a healthy relationship with me, regardless of what I choose to call you or who is listed on my birth certificate. \nYour issues are yours. Please deal with them yourself and leave me out of it.\u201d", "[deleted]", "Trust me, if I'm being obtuse it's absolutely not in purpose.", "The compromise is for me and my younger brother. Not for my older brother. He's not part of the compromise.", "They're asking OP not to erase them from her life like her older brother did \u2014 and like they tried to erase the kids' mom.\n\nTheir request is \"even if you follow your brother's lead an have your grandparents adopt you, can you just act like we're still your parents?\"", "well then go reread the post and the comments OP has been pretty clear about whats going on. \n\nLiterally you ignored a whole comment from OP that was in response to your question."]}
