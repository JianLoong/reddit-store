Here\u2019s why. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re playing favorites as I would assume you spent similar time with your other two boys growing up, similar Cosleep situations etc. On top of that, you tried to do this another way in which Jimmy would cosleep with your oldest. Your oldest didn\u2019t like that or agree to it, you respected that. I also agree with you that it would be odd to ask another adult male (regardless of it being his uncle), to cosleep with him. If your 10 year old is bad tempered and you know he won\u2019t agree to it or be able to commit to it as a 10 year old, I get that not being an option. So it\u2019s clearly a tricky situation. \n\nNormally I would say SIMPLE! Just make this a birthday treat for Jimmy, and then have similar experiences for your older boys when their birthdays come along. However doing that doesn\u2019t sound like an option because of Jimmy\u2019s co sleeping. How would you take either of your other boys away alone if Jimmy absolutely REQUIRES cosleeping (that\u2019s how it comes across in your post)?? So then it would be unfair. \n\nIf it\u2019s the plane ride to a work trip that is what will make each feel special on their bday then that is what you\u2019re signing up for doing it for one. It\u2019s not enough to just spend time with all of them, it needs to be comparable to remain fair. Do you want them to grow up perceiving Jimmy as your favorite who got to go on trips with you when they weren\u2019t ever brought?? Even if it is just bc of the logistics, I think that\u2019s how they\u2019ll see it. That\u2019s how most of the responders to this thread already see it. \n\nI get you\u2019re trying your best but it seems like this isn\u2019t a very sustainable choice for your family. You may not be comfortable sharing and that\u2019s totally fair, but I am wondering what your parameters for Jimmy\u2019s cosleeping are? When did your eldest 2 stop cosleeping? How did you/they make that transition? Was it a smooth transition for  them? How long did it take? Because I\u2019m (speculating)thinking that it could be an optimal time to ween him off of cosleeping. Turning 6, bday trip with dad, a turning point where it helps you out in the right now sticky situation you\u2019re navigating, while also allowing you to do the same for your older two sons for their bdays. Let them choose their desired bday celebration, if it\u2019s work trip with dad,  so be it and honor that if that\u2019s what you\u2019re choosing to do with Jimmy. But if you do it for him, you need to do it for them too (maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and they won\u2019t want an overnight trip but if they pick it and you did it for their brother, you kinda have to do it for them too).", "YTA, but i get that it's complicated.

Doesn;t have to co-sleep but can sit with your son while he falls asleep, etc. And i think you should start working on a little more independence. What if something did happen to you?

That being said hopefully it isn\u2019t a pattern of parentification, but based on what was included here, that\u2019s really rushing to conclusions to say.

The part I agree with: the middle paragraph with advice and a possible solution that also makes it easier for dad in the process as well.\n\nI don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s necessarily purposeful. I didn\u2019t get the impression that he\u2019s leaving the other two out just bc they wouldn\u2019t do what he wanted. If that\u2019s the case it\u2019s fucked but there\u2019s not really a way to know that and it certainly wasn\u2019t my impression. It honestly sounds like given their current situation and routine, that would be the most seamless course of action if his other kids didn\u2019t mind it. They do which is also understandable. I think if he could combat that with legitimate promises of comparable birthday experiences of their choosing when their bdays come (and if a flight is involved so be it), that that would be helpful. \n\nI also like that you weren\u2019t judgey about the cosleeping; I\u2019m not a parent but I think even when people are, not everyone has the answers and to judge based on someone\u2019s parental decision is kinda screwed up, which a lot of people in the comments are doing. I do agree though that this can\u2019t be a long time thing, clearly he can\u2019t cosleep forever. However if I WAS a parent I wouldn\u2019t want to start that journey in this scenario. I would argue that it could be traumatizing for the youngest to be  told that he can\u2019t go with him, when dad is always home, can\u2019t sleep with him or anyone else when that\u2019s all he\u2019s ever known, AND it\u2019s not like dad is home and in the other room if he needs him. He\u2019s not down the hall if the kid wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to find him. Sounds like a HUGE bandaid to rip off. I agree that at some point it\u2019ll have to stop. Idk logistics on what age group can benefit from cosleeping. BUT I think if that\u2019s his norm, this would be a cruel way to change that. 0-60 real quick. Throw the kid in the deep end to swim type thing. Obviously it COULD go totally fine, but if I were a parent I wouldn\u2019t chance that either.

That\u2019s evidence he cares even if he\u2019s not doing everything 100% perfect. That doesn\u2019t sound like a shit parent to me.", "I\u2019ll never understand replies like this. Calling out all the bad, and twisting words, without even offering up advice or what you think would help the situation. I also agree that it\u2019s a YTA sitch, and that the older two will view this as favoritism if the youngest ends up going alone with dad, and no alternative, comparable alone time is spent with the other two as well. But the approach is just so aggressive and negative, how could anyone even allow themself to listen to your point?? This guy is actively seeking advice on a situation to try and do what\u2019s best for all of them, and it does seem like he\u2019s coddling the youngest a bit. But he didn\u2019t force his oldest, he asked if he could help him out and respected when he said no.

I se what you mean about asking the eldest and not the 10 year old, but I also see why OP would consider his oldest and more mature son, as an option, and not a 10 year old. When they\u2019re that young there\u2019s a huge maturity gap even though the 13 year old is still a kid, even if the 10 year old wasn\u2019t ill-tempered. A lot of people in these replies seem to be assuming information, personalizing the situation, or making parenting judgments about things that aren\u2019t the point of the post (cosleeping). Dude is trying to do what\u2019s best for all of them and making everyone happy in a tough situation that he clearly doesn\u2019t deal with often and has to handle as a single dad.

Jimmy needs to learn to be his own person.", "I really dont understand how you dont think youre playing favourites, while telling us why hes your favourite?", "I\u2019m not judging at all, (I left a lengthy response myself), I\u2019m not a parent either and I\u2019m not a therapist. All of that being said, I am in my 20s and had very loving parents, and still I am currently in the process of unpacking and unraveling certain light childhood traumas I have specifically around inconsistent treatment between my parents and myself vs my parents and sibling. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing noteworthy like a trip or anything that I recall, however he has a high sense of entitlement, he assumes he is always right and doesn\u2019t challenge his own beliefs, he is irresponsible when compared to me, and yet he is enabled by my parents. I was always the easy kid. Still am. They have 2 adult children at home (brother is older than me), and in doing therapy that started over my own breakup, I\u2019ve continued and have delved into my own past with my family. So now instead of just resenting everyone without reason, I realize the exact root cause of me getting pissed off at certain family dynamics that STILL remain today. The unequal treatment of myself vs my brother being paramount. Aside from that, I have dealt with a LOT of attachment issues. \n\nFrom the love and availability my parents supplied me with as a child, I\u2019m not as bad off as a lot of people, and I prior to my last relationship was a very secure individual. But I also grew up without an understanding of proper boundaries, what my needs are, and relationships with ideal communication/conflict resolution. My parents love each other and are together, but each has an insecure attachment style that was unknowingly modeled to me my entire life. \n\nAs secure as I was, I still ended up being incredibly susceptible to developing an insecure attachment style within my first serious romantic relationship (23-26). I became incredibly anxiously attached, I didn\u2019t see red flags from my partner who was an absolutely beautiful person, but had his own childhood trauma and unacceptable habits, subpar communication and conflict resolution skills, and we became involved in a toxic cycle of arguing and him stonewalling. It ruined our relationship. I didn\u2019t even know about any of this stuff until he broke up with me. He still doesn\u2019t know about any of it. And honestly, even a year later I realize that had I known about this, we would have had more of a chance at a successful relationship because we really had strong love and a strong connection aside from all of that. \n\nOn a personal level, if you truly believe that your child is that attached, PLEASE look into attachment theory and educate yourself on it for his sake. So you know what signs to look for and how to properly influence him to grow up with a secure attachment style. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with having an insecure attachment style, and it\u2019s not a diagnosis or disorder, but it makes relationships unnecessarily harder especially later in life. \n\nI\u2019m sure you are a great dad, and you are doing the best you can. I only bring this stuff up because most people I know hadn\u2019t heard of attachment style before I learned about it. I didn\u2019t know about it despite it having a chokehold on most of my relationships friend/familial/romantic/etc. it really influences so much and a lot of it goes back to childhood. I knew things were wrong in my relationship but I didn\u2019t have the knowledge about any of this previously to help myself heal both myself and my relationship while I was still in it. And let me tell you, healing this shit as an adult is HARD. \n\nThe attachment issues regarding my ex were hard enough, and now that I\u2019m on a good page with that and leaning more into healing my own wounds from my family it is even harder. They don\u2019t always understand what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to change my behaviors with them bc it\u2019s uncomfortable, and we\u2019ve lived one way for so long that from their pov I\u2019m the one creating waves. It HURTS badly when they misunderstand me, and not that I\u2019m aware of the root cause, of this annoyance and pain and my own emotions, it is SO triggering and painful to experience more of the same treatment when it does still happen.", "It's fine when it's an occasional bonding time.

Idk how it was presented to them as op didn\u2019t really address that, but he mentioned they were mad about it so idt they\u2019re happy to be free of their sibling as much as they are jealous.

What's the logic there? Is it weird because he is not a safe adult for your kids to be around?

You should have brought all of them, or none of them. This sets up issues with favouritism, EVEN IF you don't favour your youngest. Also, co-sleeping with your child shouldn't be the only way they can sleep, especially at his age. And it probably isn't, regardless of your anxiety (and Jimmy's).\n\nThis could have been a teaching moment. Leave Jimmy with his brothers and their uncle. Daddy goes away for a night. The happiest result would be that maybe Jimmy gets upset and scared, but manages to self-soothe and fall asleep on his own. Worst case scenario? Jimmy doesn't sleep, and is maybe cranky and a little under the weather for a day or two. So you would talk to him, and explain that you had to go away for a night, but you came back.

Different cultures set independent sleep at different rates anywhere from birth to about 12. Assuming your elder sons coslept too, they appear to have transitioned to sleeping alone naturally, so I don't think there's a psychological issue.\n\nThat being said, you need to find what works for your own family. I will not pass a biased moral judgment on your practices and I understand it's important to you, but you need to be pragmatic and realistic about what works for *your family*. You are a single dad, you have to take business trips, and other family members have vocalized a desire NOT to cosleep. Cosleeping does not seem to mesh well with other aspects of your lifestyle and has caused this problem where you simultaneously need your child to sleep alone, and he needs to not sleep alone. You need to create a better long-term plan.\n\nOptions include a) remain co-sleeping, but ensure you will not take business trips away from your family; b) remain co-sleeping but ensure you will always be able to make arrangements for the whole family to come on these trips; or c) transition your youngest to an independent sleeping arrangement. Sorry, but you don't get the best of each option while pushing the consequences of those options onto your sons. \n\nIt also seems there is a favoritism aspect going on as well. It's not uncommon for parents to have a favorite and it can come in different forms - either one child has increased needs from age or disability and favoritism is an unintentional side effect, or parents have preferences in their childrens personalities (or lackthereof). Your situation seems to be a mix of both. However, even though it's a common parental experience, it's your job as a parent to listen to and meet the needs of all your children. Your defensive \"I am not playing favorites\" and your elder sons being under the impression that you are indeed playing favorites tells me everyone's aware the youngest is the favorite, including you.  \n\n\nSo yes, YTA.
