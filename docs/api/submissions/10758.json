Here\u2019s why. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re playing favorites as I would assume you spent similar time with your other two boys growing up, similar Cosleep situations etc. On top of that, you tried to do this another way in which Jimmy would cosleep with your oldest. Your oldest didn\u2019t like that or agree to it, you respected that. I also agree with you that it would be odd to ask another adult male (regardless of it being his uncle), to cosleep with him. If your 10 year old is bad tempered and you know he won\u2019t agree to it or be able to commit to it as a 10 year old, I get that not being an option. So it\u2019s clearly a tricky situation. \n\nNormally I would say SIMPLE! Just make this a birthday treat for Jimmy, and then have similar experiences for your older boys when their birthdays come along. However doing that doesn\u2019t sound like an option because of Jimmy\u2019s co sleeping. How would you take either of your other boys away alone if Jimmy absolutely REQUIRES cosleeping (that\u2019s how it comes across in your post)?? So then it would be unfair. \n\nIf it\u2019s the plane ride to a work trip that is what will make each feel special on their bday then that is what you\u2019re signing up for doing it for one. It\u2019s not enough to just spend time with all of them, it needs to be comparable to remain fair. Do you want them to grow up perceiving Jimmy as your favorite who got to go on trips with you when they weren\u2019t ever brought?? Even if it is just bc of the logistics, I think that\u2019s how they\u2019ll see it. That\u2019s how most of the responders to this thread already see it. \n\nI get you\u2019re trying your best but it seems like this isn\u2019t a very sustainable choice for your family. You may not be comfortable sharing and that\u2019s totally fair, but I am wondering what your parameters for Jimmy\u2019s cosleeping are? When did your eldest 2 stop cosleeping? How did you/they make that transition? Was it a smooth transition for  them? How long did it take? Because I\u2019m (speculating)thinking that it could be an optimal time to ween him off of cosleeping. Turning 6, bday trip with dad, a turning point where it helps you out in the right now sticky situation you\u2019re navigating, while also allowing you to do the same for your older two sons for their bdays. Let them choose their desired bday celebration, if it\u2019s work trip with dad,  so be it and honor that if that\u2019s what you\u2019re choosing to do with Jimmy. But if you do it for him, you need to do it for them too (maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and they won\u2019t want an overnight trip but if they pick it and you did it for their brother, you kinda have to do it for them too).", "YTA, but i get that it's complicated.

But, your solution really wasn't fair to the other two boys.", "I think most of us indulge our youngest, but you've gone beyond that, uoure taking a kid with you on a business trip because a storm is rolling in.

Either way, to rush to accusing him of neglect when he\u2019s seeking the best course of action for his boys even if it doesn\u2019t align with what he was planning to do, suggests that he\u2019s go their best interest at heart and doesn\u2019t neglect them. That being said hopefully it isn\u2019t a pattern of parentification, but based on what was included here, that\u2019s really rushing to conclusions to say.

The part I agree with: the middle paragraph with advice and a possible solution that also makes it easier for dad in the process as well.\n\nI don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s necessarily purposeful. I didn\u2019t get the impression that he\u2019s leaving the other two out just bc they wouldn\u2019t do what he wanted. If that\u2019s the case it\u2019s fucked but there\u2019s not really a way to know that and it certainly wasn\u2019t my impression. It honestly sounds like given their current situation and routine, that would be the most seamless course of action if his other kids didn\u2019t mind it. They do which is also understandable. I think if he could combat that with legitimate promises of comparable birthday experiences of their choosing when their bdays come (and if a flight is involved so be it), that that would be helpful. \n\nI also like that you weren\u2019t judgey about the cosleeping; I\u2019m not a parent but I think even when people are, not everyone has the answers and to judge based on someone\u2019s parental decision is kinda screwed up, which a lot of people in the comments are doing. I do agree though that this can\u2019t be a long time thing, clearly he can\u2019t cosleep forever. However if I WAS a parent I wouldn\u2019t want to start that journey in this scenario. I would argue that it could be traumatizing for the youngest to be  told that he can\u2019t go with him, when dad is always home, can\u2019t sleep with him or anyone else when that\u2019s all he\u2019s ever known, AND it\u2019s not like dad is home and in the other room if he needs him. He\u2019s not down the hall if the kid wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to find him. Sounds like a HUGE bandaid to rip off. I agree that at some point it\u2019ll have to stop. Idk logistics on what age group can benefit from cosleeping. BUT I think if that\u2019s his norm, this would be a cruel way to change that. 0-60 real quick. Throw the kid in the deep end to swim type thing. Obviously it COULD go totally fine, but if I were a parent I wouldn\u2019t chance that either.

He\u2019s on here looking for advice and opinions that go against his own for the good of his kids. He\u2019s actively looking for a better solution, and thoughts on his. That\u2019s evidence he cares even if he\u2019s not doing everything 100% perfect. That doesn\u2019t sound like a shit parent to me.", "I\u2019ll never understand replies like this. Calling out all the bad, and twisting words, without even offering up advice or what you think would help the situation. I also agree that it\u2019s a YTA sitch, and that the older two will view this as favoritism if the youngest ends up going alone with dad, and no alternative, comparable alone time is spent with the other two as well. But the approach is just so aggressive and negative, how could anyone even allow themself to listen to your point?? This guy is actively seeking advice on a situation to try and do what\u2019s best for all of them, and it does seem like he\u2019s coddling the youngest a bit. But he didn\u2019t force his oldest, he asked if he could help him out and respected when he said no. The 10 year old was described as curmudgeon aka having a difficult disposition/ill tempered, which is common for that age. I se what you mean about asking the eldest and not the 10 year old, but I also see why OP would consider his oldest and more mature son, as an option, and not a 10 year old. When they\u2019re that young there\u2019s a huge maturity gap even though the 13 year old is still a kid, even if the 10 year old wasn\u2019t ill-tempered. A lot of people in these replies seem to be assuming information, personalizing the situation, or making parenting judgments about things that aren\u2019t the point of the post (cosleeping). Dude is trying to do what\u2019s best for all of them and making everyone happy in a tough situation that he clearly doesn\u2019t deal with often and has to handle as a single dad. Have some grace and compassion. He can be the AH without being a villain/bad person/bad dad. Maybe offer up some advice on what you WOULD do in his situation since he is struggling here.", "I thought this, but putting myself in a kid mindset, it would still work out to Jimmy being perceived as getting special treatment. If he went on the special getaway and then also the trip with all three kids the following weekend, I worry that it still would seem to the kids that he\u2019s the fave.", "He did say he would play in an office, so I think he would be brought along. I was wondering the same though, kinda sounds like a mellow kid and can play in the office while OP is working.", "So the answer is no, only your favorite gets special nights with you", "That wasn't the question. Do you have alone trips with the other kids? If you do this then you should do it separately with each kid. Otherwise this absolutely comes across as playing favorites.", "That wasn\u2019t his question and so to make it easy for you the question is:\nDoes your ten year old get special one to one time without the others like your 6year old does EVERY night?\nSame question for 13 year old", "You did not answer the question.", "That\u2019s a no. No room for the other kids in daddy and jimmys bed", "It\u2019s a work trip you should t be bringing any of them", "You are 100% playing favorites.", "Then don\u2019t take any. If you take one and not the others, then yta.", "You think you are like minded with a 5 year old??... Or you just like him more? Seems like you want Jimmy to be very attached to you. Independence is not a bad thing for children. Taking only 1 kid with you for whatever reason sets a really bad precedent. Your older kids will absolutely see this as a reward for Jimmy.", "Then don\u2019t take any of them", "But you still have 3. All of them or none of them. Awful parent.", "You could take each kid on a similar trip, one at a time.", "So what? You're hiding under his desk in class? You hold his hand while he uses the toilet?", "You are \u2018like-minded\u2019 with a 6 year old?? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Stop with the gross justification. It\u2019s disgusting. Like minded with a 6yr old. Do you hear yourself? You asked and here you are arguing with everyone who is saying you e taken this too far. You favor Jimmy. It\u2019s gross. I feel sorry for your other children. Listen and learn. You aren\u2019t helping Jimmy. Jimmy needs to learn to be his own person.", "I really dont understand how you dont think youre playing favourites, while telling us why hes your favourite?", "I\u2019m not judging at all, (I left a lengthy response myself), I\u2019m not a parent either and I\u2019m not a therapist. All of that being said, I am in my 20s and had very loving parents, and still I am currently in the process of unpacking and unraveling certain light childhood traumas I have specifically around inconsistent treatment between my parents and myself vs my parents and sibling. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing noteworthy like a trip or anything that I recall, however he has a high sense of entitlement, he assumes he is always right and doesn\u2019t challenge his own beliefs, he is irresponsible when compared to me, and yet he is enabled by my parents. I was always the easy kid. Still am. They have 2 adult children at home (brother is older than me), and in doing therapy that started over my own breakup, I\u2019ve continued and have delved into my own past with my family. So now instead of just resenting everyone without reason, I realize the exact root cause of me getting pissed off at certain family dynamics that STILL remain today. The unequal treatment of myself vs my brother being paramount. Aside from that, I have dealt with a LOT of attachment issues. \n\nFrom the love and availability my parents supplied me with as a child, I\u2019m not as bad off as a lot of people, and I prior to my last relationship was a very secure individual. But I also grew up without an understanding of proper boundaries, what my needs are, and relationships with ideal communication/conflict resolution. My parents love each other and are together, but each has an insecure attachment style that was unknowingly modeled to me my entire life. \n\nAs secure as I was, I still ended up being incredibly susceptible to developing an insecure attachment style within my first serious romantic relationship (23-26). I became incredibly anxiously attached, I didn\u2019t see red flags from my partner who was an absolutely beautiful person, but had his own childhood trauma and unacceptable habits, subpar communication and conflict resolution skills, and we became involved in a toxic cycle of arguing and him stonewalling. It ruined our relationship. I didn\u2019t even know about any of this stuff until he broke up with me. He still doesn\u2019t know about any of it. And honestly, even a year later I realize that had I known about this, we would have had more of a chance at a successful relationship because we really had strong love and a strong connection aside from all of that. \n\nOn a personal level, if you truly believe that your child is that attached, PLEASE look into attachment theory and educate yourself on it for his sake. So you know what signs to look for and how to properly influence him to grow up with a secure attachment style. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with having an insecure attachment style, and it\u2019s not a diagnosis or disorder, but it makes relationships unnecessarily harder especially later in life. \n\nI\u2019m sure you are a great dad, and you are doing the best you can. I only bring this stuff up because most people I know hadn\u2019t heard of attachment style before I learned about it. I didn\u2019t know about it despite it having a chokehold on most of my relationships friend/familial/romantic/etc. it really influences so much and a lot of it goes back to childhood. I knew things were wrong in my relationship but I didn\u2019t have the knowledge about any of this previously to help myself heal both myself and my relationship while I was still in it. And let me tell you, healing this shit as an adult is HARD. \n\nThe attachment issues regarding my ex were hard enough, and now that I\u2019m on a good page with that and leaning more into healing my own wounds from my family it is even harder. They don\u2019t always understand what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to change my behaviors with them bc it\u2019s uncomfortable, and we\u2019ve lived one way for so long that from their pov I\u2019m the one creating waves. It HURTS badly when they misunderstand me, and not that I\u2019m aware of the root cause, of this annoyance and pain and my own emotions, it is SO triggering and painful to experience more of the same treatment when it does still happen.", "It's fine when it's an occasional bonding time.  It's not fine when you're preventing your kid from learning how to cope on their own or stalling their development.", "That\u2019s wayyyy too late for a kid to develop his own bedtime routine and get used to sleeping by himself. Why would you let it continue this long", "What a nightmare lmao", "10 is probably too old. I would say no older than maybe eight. But, it\u2019s a personal choice.", "Probably figures that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll pay attention to him.", "Me too. Until my son was 2. Cosleeping has benefits. Whatever this guy is doing is weird.", "Nvr know kid could remember it \ud83d\ude05 I can remember a specific time I went &slept with my mom. I was 7/8 lol", "It\u2019s only weird because he made it weird.", "Noooo, I would think it equally weird if OP were a mom.\n\nLook, sometimes my six year old will wake up early and get in bed with me and his dad. I won\u2019t kick him out but not do I encourage it or celebrate it as OP seems to.", "Im sorry but how he's wording it if this was a woman i would also say the same thing. \n\nIts really weird", "It sounds creepy here in an overly-dependent way, not in a sexual way.", "The thing is your not even realising and coming to terms that he is getting older. You wouldn\u2019t let him sleep with you when he\u2019s sixteen, six is the age when he doesn\u2019t need to depend on you too much", "Your son should be able to sleep in his own room. Why is it wrong? Look at the situation you\u2019re in now. If you raised him to be a confident child he wouldn\u2019t need to sleep with daddy every night.", ">He\u2019s on here looking for advice and opinions that go against his own for the good of his kids\n\nUh, no. This sub is specifically for asking if the person is an asshole. This is not an advice sub. YTA", ">offering up advice\n\nRule 9\n\nThis is NOT an advice sub", "That makes sense, but knowing the age group of the older boys I would think they would be happy that the youngest is gone for a night.  Now I do agree he should spend more individual time with each kid.  Knowing how kids are I would also think the older kids either pick on the youngest or he gets on their nerves.  Technically, it\u2019s a break for them from him.  Plus, if the youngest is scared to sleep by himself during a storm he\u2019s going to whine and get on the other\u2019s nerves.", "FWIW OP has said he co-slept with all of his boys, not just Jimmy. I gather this is the first time OP has had to be away overnight at least in Jimmy\u2019s lifetime.", "My 6yo has a routine. I give him his bath, help him brush his teeth, dressed, stories and cuddles. He's out by 730pm. I don't go to bed till 9.", "Yeah I can't lie re reading that line he did not help himself with that wording", "I've seen loads of mom's wanting to sleep with thier children, and at like 6-8 they stop and other people are saying savour every moment and it all seems pretty normal. Just from what I've seen it seems to be normalised for mom's but your opinions coukd differ\n\nFair enough", "He can sleep with me as long as he wants. My 10yo just started sleeping in his own room and my 13yo did the same when he was 9.", "I would normally agree but I feel like the potential favoritism aspect would get in the way of that. Obviously idk the kids but if he\u2019s not there bc he\u2019s with dad, while they\u2019re mad they can\u2019t go, it\u2019s already starting a dynamic where they see the treatment as unfair. Idk how it was presented to them as op didn\u2019t really address that, but he mentioned they were mad about it so idt they\u2019re happy to be free of their sibling as much as they are jealous. Which is easy to write off as an adult bc they likely will be doing more fun things at home, than business trip activities, however from the kids\u2019 eyes the youngest gets to go with dad and they don\u2019t. I also wonder what Jimmy is going to do while OP is doing business trip things but maybe his employers are cool with him tagging along so long as he plays quietly.", "I\u2019m getting major insecure attachment vibes with jimmy here, when are you going to draw the line with when your son stops sleeping in your bed? Will that even ever happen?", "Your Kids need independence from you asap", "Yeah I\u2019m hoping it was just a poor choice of words and not as creepy as it came off lol", "Sounds like you're delaying your kids development because you want to keep them \"young\" for as long as possible. That is not healthy at all.", "Well I\u2019m not going to argue with you but the majority of people would agree that they\u2019re too old. The fact you like it is creepy to me and hopefully eventually you see your error", "Now that is a great question.  Where and what will the youngest do while dad is at work.  I hope he figures it out."]}
