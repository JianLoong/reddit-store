If it works for you then fine, but don't force that on other people, especially if they didn't grow up how your specific culture did. Should they try to learn some of it? Sure, if they care about you they should. But to expect it all the time is unreasonable. Also, not going to lie but I see a lot of these outdated social obligations create alot of resentment and toxicity. Some are fine,  but its when it becomes having to sacrifice one's own happiness for the sake of someone else's (unless someone chooses too) that I draw the line at. It's something that has been in most all traditional cultures, but some of it is just no longer necessary. Lots of underlying bigotry/misogyny in these outdated roles. Your husband seems like a decent guy and he did what he knew to do. Just because he didn't read your ins doesn't mean he was uncaring.

Haha, seriously?", "YTA\n\nI feel if you were a little annoyed/upset and nagged him a little, this would be fine and it would be more like an N A H. But it sounds like you really went off at him and that's unwarranted. He went to check on you, got you what you needed, made sure you were okay, and then went about his business. Could he have been a more attentive? Sure. But if you needed it, you also could have called out to him when he was getting ready to leave and told him you still feel a bit nauseous and for him to stay by your side a little. Of course it feels nice to have him do that on his own without asking, but it sounds like he made sure you were okay and brought you what you needed. It would be like if someone had a stomachache and their spouse got them some ginger tea and Pepto and let them lie down then went about their day. There's nothing else to do at that point and if it's not serious, then it should be okay. Like I said, even if you nagged him a tiny bit playfully, that would be probably fine too.

You should've told him exactly what you wanted.", "NTA. He's minimizing what you experienced, and so are the people who are calling you TA.

If someone almost passed out in front of me--even if it was a stranger or someone I didn't even like--I would stick around for a few minutes to make sure they were ok. If it was my partner? Yeah, I would have sat down next to him and chill for a bit and made sure he's good to go before I wandered off. \n\nIf someone is feeling faint or dizzy they aren't in the best frame of mind to determine if they're ok. I still remember CPR and first aid training: one of the first things they teach is that people will say they're ok sometimes, even when they're having a minor heart attack, bleeding out, etc..

When you were asked if you were fine, you were not but said you were.
