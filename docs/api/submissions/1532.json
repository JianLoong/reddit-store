I'm English, and my husband is French, and we live in France.\n\nWe decided to name our son Louis because it's a name that works in both English and in French (and because we both love it). We pronounce it the French way at home (loo-ee). My brother (38m) absolutely adores Louis, and Louis loves him too. He has a lot of nicknames for him, (Little Looie-dooie, Mario and Looigi, Guadelouee - that sort of thing), and the one he uses most often is Lewis pronounced the English way. He'll say things like \"Loo *is* in the room\" etc.\n\nHe started doing this from the day he was born, and my son loves it. He calls Lewis his \"English name\", and the last time we went through passport control, he even announced to the border guard, \"My English name is Lewis\".\n\nAnyway, a couple of weeks ago, my brother was visiting and my sister-in-law was there (my husband's brother's wife). She's nice, don't get me wrong, and she's a really wonderful aunt. The problem started when my brother was calling Louis \"Lewis\" while playing with him. She got quite uppity and said \"That's not his name.\" and even after my brother explained that he knows and that it's just a nickname (and even after I told her that Louis loves it and that it's a cute nickname) she wouldn't stop. \n\nMy brother's not a confrontation-type person, so he just started using his other nicknames for Louis instead. This was the last day of his visit, so in the afternoon when it was time for him to head to the airport, he hugged my son and said, \"See you soon, Lewis Carroll\". My sister-in-law basically blew up and started telling him that he's bastardising the name and that he's being xenophobic towards my son. My brother's a really gentle-hearted person and was basically in shock, so I told her (quite aggressively, I'll admit, but I'm quite protective over my brother - he had things hard growing up and he's quite sensitive) that she needs to mind her own business and butt out, and that my son's name, and what his uncle calls him, is none of her damn business.\n\nShe basically stormed out at that point, as did my brother-in-law (her husband). My brother apologised for causing any issues but I told him he hadn't, that Louis loves the nickname and that he should 100% keep using it. My husband is on my side (and apparently, so is *his* brother), but it's causing issues with his wife and I'm wondering if I should approach her to apologise/ try to explain things.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667645375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymqjrk/aita_for_telling_my_sisterinlaw_to_buttout_over/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She may have a valid for her reason to do this.  Maybe she is thinking that he needs someone to speak up for him.  If she has ever had a nickname she didn't like but it took a long time to get people to call her something that was preferred I could see her meaning well but not communicating those intentions well.\n\nI have known more than one Sarah get upset when people drop the \"h\" because it's \"not how other friend/sister/daughter's spells it.\"  Even in gir scouts (I am in the US) I witnessed a girl named Sarah refuse to do the camp-out chores because she did not see her name there and the troop lead pointed it out to her as she had spelled it Sara (last initial) citing \"this is my older daughter's name too, I spelled it correctly.\"  The girl continued to refuse because again not her name.  The troop leader grabbed a marker and wrote the h in (the chart was typed).\n\nThe girl continued to refuse, not out of laziness, but principle, stating that it still wasn't right because it wasn't typed and she deserved to have the same consideration as Jessy, Jessie, and Jessi (one of them was another of that troop leader's daughters, 1990's had a lot of Jessica's in US elementary schools).  That girl had a reputation of having an attitude problem at our elementary school and middle school because she had to fight for all three of her names (first, middle, and last) at various intervals until she hit high school and had a chance to speak to the superintendent in his office for a formal complaint about her teachers dropping a letter that is pronounced in her last name (think like the difference between the words \"twill\" and \"till\" that one letter can make a difference) but is similar enough that \"it's not that big of a deal\" when legally it could be.\n\nIf your sister-in-law had issues like poor Sarah did or with a nickname she really didn't like, I could see some misplaced (but well meaning) sense of justice kick in.  That said, after she was told by everyone involved (especially your son) she should have let it go.\n\nI was kind if waffling over n t a and n a h to be honest.\n\nEdited for completion.", "I think that\u2019s it. Jealousy.", "Yep, jealous or she is herself xenophobic, either way she sould be the one apologising to your brother and son.", "NTA stay out of it. You have nothing to explain or apologize for."]}
