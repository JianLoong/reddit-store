{"id": 1532, "submission_id": "ymqjrk", "title": "AITA for telling my sister-in-law to butt-out over my son's name?", "selftext": "I (35f) have a son (6m) with my husband (37m). I'm English, and my husband is French, and we live in France.\n\nWe decided to name our son Louis because it's a name that works in both English and in French (and because we both love it). We pronounce it the French way at home (loo-ee). My brother (38m) absolutely adores Louis, and Louis loves him too. He has a lot of nicknames for him, (Little Looie-dooie, Mario and Looigi, Guadelouee - that sort of thing), and the one he uses most often is Lewis pronounced the English way. He'll say things like \"Loo *is* in the room\" etc.\n\nHe started doing this from the day he was born, and my son loves it. He calls Lewis his \"English name\", and the last time we went through passport control, he even announced to the border guard, \"My English name is Lewis\".\n\nAnyway, a couple of weeks ago, my brother was visiting and my sister-in-law was there (my husband's brother's wife). She's nice, don't get me wrong, and she's a really wonderful aunt. The problem started when my brother was calling Louis \"Lewis\" while playing with him. She got quite uppity and said \"That's not his name.\" and even after my brother explained that he knows and that it's just a nickname (and even after I told her that Louis loves it and that it's a cute nickname) she wouldn't stop. \n\nMy brother's not a confrontation-type person, so he just started using his other nicknames for Louis instead. This was the last day of his visit, so in the afternoon when it was time for him to head to the airport, he hugged my son and said, \"See you soon, Lewis Carroll\". My sister-in-law basically blew up and started telling him that he's bastardising the name and that he's being xenophobic towards my son. My brother's a really gentle-hearted person and was basically in shock, so I told her (quite aggressively, I'll admit, but I'm quite protective over my brother - he had things hard growing up and he's quite sensitive) that she needs to mind her own business and butt out, and that my son's name, and what his uncle calls him, is none of her damn business.\n\nShe basically stormed out at that point, as did my brother-in-law (her husband). My brother apologised for causing any issues but I told him he hadn't, that Louis loves the nickname and that he should 100% keep using it. My husband is on my side (and apparently, so is *his* brother), but it's causing issues with his wife and I'm wondering if I should approach her to apologise/ try to explain things.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667645375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymqjrk/aita_for_telling_my_sisterinlaw_to_buttout_over/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
