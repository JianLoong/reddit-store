I'm English, and my husband is French, and we live in France.\n\nWe decided to name our son Louis because it's a name that works in both English and in French (and because we both love it). We pronounce it the French way at home (loo-ee). My brother (38m) absolutely adores Louis, and Louis loves him too. He has a lot of nicknames for him, (Little Looie-dooie, Mario and Looigi, Guadelouee - that sort of thing), and the one he uses most often is Lewis pronounced the English way. He'll say things like \"Loo *is* in the room\" etc.\n\nHe started doing this from the day he was born, and my son loves it. He calls Lewis his \"English name\", and the last time we went through passport control, he even announced to the border guard, \"My English name is Lewis\".\n\nAnyway, a couple of weeks ago, my brother was visiting and my sister-in-law was there (my husband's brother's wife). She's nice, don't get me wrong, and she's a really wonderful aunt. The problem started when my brother was calling Louis \"Lewis\" while playing with him. She got quite uppity and said \"That's not his name.\" and even after my brother explained that he knows and that it's just a nickname (and even after I told her that Louis loves it and that it's a cute nickname) she wouldn't stop. \n\nMy brother's not a confrontation-type person, so he just started using his other nicknames for Louis instead. This was the last day of his visit, so in the afternoon when it was time for him to head to the airport, he hugged my son and said, \"See you soon, Lewis Carroll\". My sister-in-law basically blew up and started telling him that he's bastardising the name and that he's being xenophobic towards my son. My brother's a really gentle-hearted person and was basically in shock, so I told her (quite aggressively, I'll admit, but I'm quite protective over my brother - he had things hard growing up and he's quite sensitive) that she needs to mind her own business and butt out, and that my son's name, and what his uncle calls him, is none of her damn business.\n\nShe basically stormed out at that point, as did my brother-in-law (her husband). My brother apologised for causing any issues but I told him he hadn't, that Louis loves the nickname and that he should 100% keep using it. My husband is on my side (and apparently, so is *his* brother), but it's causing issues with his wife and I'm wondering if I should approach her to apologise/ try to explain things.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667645375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymqjrk/aita_for_telling_my_sisterinlaw_to_buttout_over/", "score": 946, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That girl had a reputation of having an attitude problem at our elementary school and middle school because she had to fight for all three of her names (first, middle, and last) at various intervals until she hit high school and had a chance to speak to the superintendent in his office for a formal complaint about her teachers dropping a letter that is pronounced in her last name (think like the difference between the words \"twill\" and \"till\" that one letter can make a difference) but is similar enough that \"it's not that big of a deal\" when legally it could be.\n\nIf your sister-in-law had issues like poor Sarah did or with a nickname she really didn't like, I could see some misplaced (but well meaning) sense of justice kick in.

He's been called Drew his entire life but in school, since he was registered under his full name, there were teachers and kids who called him Andy or Andrew sometimes. If it bothered him, he'd correct them, but mostly he didn't care.\n\nIf Louis is fine with it, she should be fine with it. It's not HER name.", "NTA I grew up with one uncle and one brother (I have 3) both calling me a completely made up word for my nick name. My brothers son (10) now calls me Aunty \u201cNickname\u201d. I love it. I love that it\u2019s special. I hope your SIL can learn to understand the fun of it.", "My aunt called me and my twin George and Georgina when we were growing up because those we our twin names. We always knew our names weren\u2019t George and Georgina and wouldn\u2019t have come if anybody else called for us like that, but we were always entertained.", "I refer to/call my husband as First Middle when I'm annoyed, any other time he's a non-name related nickname. When I miss my southern granny, who I lost a very long time ago, one of the memories that makes me smile is her chastising my father in front of me and calling him First Middle instead of the typical term of endearment. She was chewing him out about me and cookies.", "Eh, I think your definition of \u201cpretty easy\u201d and my definition of \u201cpretty easy\u201d may be different.  :-)  I wouldn\u2019t have understood how to pronounce that name just by reading it.  I think I\u2019d have to hear it to be sure.", "Yep, I agree NTA. Your son seems to love your brother\u2019s nicknames for him. Also, those nicknames are officially the cutest thing I have seen on the internet all day. It sounds like you son and brother have a wonderful relationship and it\u2019s very heartwarming!"]}
