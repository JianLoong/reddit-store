You will thereby demonstrate that you are a treasure he is throwing away, and that he is a useless wallaby.

Him being there is for your childs benefit. His family being there is for your childs benefit. Alienating one side because you don\u2019t get along with dad is a shit thing to do to your child.", "Info: why are you splitting?\n\nYTA: If he isn't abusive, violent etc., it sounds like you're depriving your daughter of her father because you picked wrong.", "YWBTA - This isn't about him. It's about your child. You don't have to go above and beyond for him. A text is sufficient. But yes, you need to let him know about it.

It's not a habit you want to start.", "NTA BUT, as someone else commented you don\u2019t want to come between the kids and their dad.  Invite him and his family, but privately explain to him this will not be a repeat of the last party. Ask someone from your family or a friend to stay with you until Ex leaves the party.  Preferably someone bigger and meaner than him.", "OP you mentioned kids, plural - so even if your 1 y/o doesn't notice dad is missing at the party, your son might. \n\nIf the dad has a good relationship with your son, YWBTA for setting a precedent that it's ok to leave a parent out of a child's milestone event. I'd agree with the other commenter who said take the long view/high road. So what if he doesn't help with planning the party? Just issue an invite and let him turn up as a guest, he doesn't need to co-host. You can mingle with the other guests and avoid him.\n\nETA: I don't know any child of divorce having two birthday parties to accomodate each side of the family, so there is some culture bias showing up in my comment. If it's common in your culture i guess you could skip inviting your husband and it would be fine?", "You can even ask: \u201cwhat day would you like to celebrate daughter\u2019s first birthday with your family?

Establish the precedent that he needs to organize events for his half of the family and you are no longer doing his emotional labor or having his energy in your life any more than absolutely needed.  The first birthday is more for the parents anyway.\n\nUnless you intend to share all birthdays and major holidays with a joint celebration, then go forward with two now.", "She's turning one. She won't know the difference. If Dad wanted to be involved, then he should've gotten involved.", "Nope. Her edit says he made a scene at their son's last birthday party after everyone left. He waited until there were no witnesses to yell at her except for their 6 month old baby and the birthday boy. Tell me what benefits did they get from that?", "I can't even drop off or pick up the kids without him starting an argument in front of them. Being around family hasn't stopped him before either.", "Please start using a parenting app that tracks all communication. You never know when you will need documentation. This would be a great first message.", "Yes, this. Great solution.", "I would do this purely to cover your own ass tbh. That way he can't claim he wasn't offered the opportunity to have his own celebration or was excluded without a chance to celebrate his child's birthday. \n\nThe fact that he argued with you in front of your child is potentially child abuse - exposing a child to domestic violence or the effects of domestic violence is child abuse. Domestic violence includes verbal abuse. Reflect on and write down the details of the argument he engaged in while your son was present. You may never need it but it's helpful to have these things documented just in case. It's worth reaching out to a local dv support service for a more objective, trained perspective on whether his behaviour is abusive - or might not be, but you also might be conditioned to excuse things that are so objective input can be really helpful. \n\nYou're NTA and given his past behaviour, you're acting in the best interests of your child/ren to prevent exposure to arguments between the two of you.", "Honestly, you don't have to explain it.  You're not his wife.  You don't plan his parties, buy Christmas cards and presents for his family, and put his name on them, remind him of his dental appointments, wash his laundry, buy him toilet paper when he's out, or any of that other stuff.\n\nNot your business.", "I saw the edit. My questions would be;\n\nWhy did he make a scene? What caused him to do that? Why are you getting divorced? Why are things bad between you guys? Who has custody- does he get to see the kids as much as you? Have you offered him the chance to help? Does he feel included in the plans?", "Yup.  She doesn't 'Wife' for him anymore, so she doesn't plan parties for him.  He can throw his own. No kid complained about having 2 parties.", "You may need a court order to force them but it\u2019s worth it!", "Thank you SO much for this"]}
