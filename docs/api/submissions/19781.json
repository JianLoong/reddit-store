That way he can't claim he wasn't offered the opportunity to have his own celebration or was excluded without a chance to celebrate his child's birthday. \n\nThe fact that he argued with you in front of your child is potentially child abuse - exposing a child to domestic violence or the effects of domestic violence is child abuse. Domestic violence includes verbal abuse. Reflect on and write down the details of the argument he engaged in while your son was present. You may never need it but it's helpful to have these things documented just in case. It's worth reaching out to a local dv support service for a more objective, trained perspective on whether his behaviour is abusive - or might not be, but you also might be conditioned to excuse things that are so objective input can be really helpful. \n\nYou're NTA and given his past behaviour, you're acting in the best interests of your child/ren to prevent exposure to arguments between the two of you.", "Honestly, you don't have to explain it.

But as he uses weaponizing incompetence to blame you for everything that doesn't go according to his little plan then he can do it alone", "Nta. \nI also wouldn't mention the party you're having until it's closer to the date. Less time for him to be petty or sabotage.", "Usually parents alternate years. My ex is not at my parties. Write him in advance, even use chatGPT if you need help. Don\u2019t say anything you wouldn\u2019t want a judge to read, don\u2019t get into a back and forth. NTA.", "He will probably be like my ex and won't even remember when the birthday is....NTA", "NTA \u2026.  As a child of divorced parents, especially non amicable ones\u2026 Celebrations should be separate If there won\u2019t be 100% agreed upon equitable effort (notice it said equity not equality, because this is financial, physical, and emotion effort and has different value to each person, so each party needs to agree what is equal to what) Every time an occasion was celebrated together, what was gained (a sense of \u201ccomplete\u201d family) was WAY outweighed by the constant weight on my chest waiting for the powder keg to blow because someone either called out a mention of non-involvement, or the other side felt guilty enough to blow up in self preservation because they knew blame was coming anyways and might as well get in front of it", "NTA. He's earned the right to be uninvited.", "Maybe give him a headsup that he and his side of the family is not welcome on your birthday party with your daughter, you certainly don't have to do this.. but I think it would be a good start of celebrating her birthday separately. You can just keep it casual and ask if he is aware you won't be celebrating birthdays together anymore.", "Have separate parties. He can do whatever he wants to celebrate the kids for their birthdays with his family and you can have your parties for the kids with your family. Let him know this is the plan going forward. Also both of you should be ok with not being able to celebrate their birthdays on the actual day.", "nope nta. having separate parties and celebrations in general are just part of the deal sometimes. maybe down the road when the beginning separation chaos has subsided you can invite him, but for now, you\u2019re not obligated. He can throw his own party for her on one of the days she\u2019s with him, that\u2019s just life for parents who aren\u2019t together anymore.", "NTA if there\u2019s time to inform him you two can do separate parties.\n\nIf you can let his parents know in passing too, that would be good so maybe they can help him and ensure your daughter is celebrated on that side.\n\nAt the end of the day, your kids best interest is that they\u2019re celebrated by those that love them. I\u2019d let his family know casually to ensure they have that chance to celebrate your kids and remain a family to them. If your exhusband is flaky, it would be a disservice to your kids to setup his failure.", "NTA How well do you think those parties are going to go with the two of you together? Probably not very. You have no obligation to have him anywhere near you. Enjoy your party and he can do whatever.", "NTA\n\nYour kid is too young to know or care. Also he can celebrate her birthday on his own time.", "Me too. NTA", "Even at age 10, the parties can be separate. My parents divorced when I was very young, and I always had separate parties, or just one, but both parents were never in attendance. The only time both families combined was for really special events like high school or college graduation, my wedding, etc.", "Even then, mine is older and one of her pros of the separation is that she gets two birthday parties \ud83d\ude02", "Yes!!  And if for any reason he says he wants to be part of your celebration, bait the hook. Talk to him about how the last time he made a scene, and that\u2019s not good for the kids to see. Keep it super civil on your side. \nIf he pulls anything else, keep a camera handy. Maybe have a close relative ready to press the record button. \nPrepare for the worst. Trust me on this.", "While this is a good take, if the kid only wants one then compromises will have to be made", "I don\u2019t have anything against this advice in general but like my specific nitpick is that I get annoyed every time I hear people talk about these cause I\u2019m so tired of how we need 5,000 different apps that each only do one specific thing. Like now I have a app to log into my work computer and a different app to log into my work VPN after I log into my work computer and a app for my bank and my pharmacy and my doctors. And now, an app for communicating with your ex spouse, yay. \n\nAt some point, \u201cthere\u2019s an app for that\u201d has started to sound more like a con than a pro.", "Depends on the judge. I couldn't get screenshots admitted into evidence by a judge I had. I was told that any texts needed to come directly from the service provider and delivered to the lawyer directly. This was a few years ago. I would definitely try to get the parenting app instead of relying on screenshots, just in case. It's less of a hassle, takes less time and is cheaper in the long run by the time you pay your attorney to fill out all the paperwork and request the actual texts.", "Genuine question. Why are parenting apps considered admissible but WhatsApp isn't?", "He can plan his own time with your child.  Why invite him to your family's celebration if you're separated and getting divorced?  Especially if you're on bad terms?\n\nNTA OP.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re separated. You have your own seperate parties.

That's what I did.\nTell him to sort him and his family out himself.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds like my ex when it comes to parties and socializing. Criticizes, complains, harasses me while I would do all the work and planning.\n\nYou're separated. You're no longer a couple. You have zero obligation to include him or his family. \n\nYou have the party when it's your turn to have your kid, which isn't necessarily on their birthday. (That's a detail to be spelled out in the parenting plan).\n\nHe is free to have a party with his family when it's his time with the kid. \n\nJust think about future kid birthdays. You won't celebrate them together. There will be times that you will have to both be present for celebrations, like school events, especially graduation. You don't have to sit together, or have a party together after though.", "NTA don't invite him but also maby don't plan the parry exactly on her birthday maby a day or two before so he dosnt turn up on her birthday to the party and cause a scene", "Your family isn't his family anymore so he's not entitled to an invite. He can organise his own thing if he wants to, with his own family.\nThis goes doubly if he's gonna kick off and spoil the nice celebration that you will organise alone for your child", "To save yourself massive fights down the line I'd probably just invite him", "You do you and he can do him", "The thing is, it\u2019s totally understandable that you wouldn\u2019t want to invite him due to his behaviour. But my concern is that if you don\u2019t invite him he\u2019ll use it against you in the divorce somehow, or use it later in life to alienate your daughter from you. Can you speak to your lawyer about this first?", "NTA, start as you mean to go on. Apart from weddings and graduations, everything else can be done separately. Celebrate Christmas and birthdays etc separately, preferably on different days so there's no clash.", "NAH- under a year is a fresh split so you\u2019re valid in wanting separate time but also it is a milestone and if it doesn\u2019t bother you romantically to be around him it seems odd not to invite him to your child-centered event which is not an event for you. Your kid won\u2019t remember it but she will see pictures. And the story will then be \u201cdad wasn\u2019t invited.\u201d You should at least prepare him to have his own party so daughter isn\u2019t like \u201cwhere was dad?\u201d later. Also maybe not good to perpetuate what sounds like your relationship issues to his relationship with his daughter. Maybe allow him try to be there more for her, step up for her. Coparenting might just be hard right now if it\u2019s \u201cout of sight out of mind.\u201d Two parties is valid for plenty of reasons but I hate this \u201cmake him do something for once\u201d attitude behind it.", "Was/is he abusive to you or your daughter? I get that he might be a huge a**h***, but sometimes, IMO, you put what\u2019s best for the kiddo ahead of what\u2019s best for you. I think you are NTA for not wanting him there, and ultimately it\u2019s your decision, but sometimes it\u2019s good if your child can see that even though you aren\u2019t together, you are together for her.", "Some people like to clutch their pearls over separate parties but they make sense in many cases unless it\u2019s a specific milestone like you mentioned or a specific birthday (bar mitzvah, quince, sweet sixteen etc.).\n\nIf mom & dad both remarry or get new long-term partners and/or have more kids, one party can be a nightmare to schedule and work out an invite list for.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Partial comment stolen from [u/Timely-References](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14afkv9/wibta_if_i_didnt_invite_my_exhusband_to_our/job2007?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Partial comment stolen from [u/Timely-References](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14afkv9/wibta_if_i_didnt_invite_my_exhusband_to_our/job2007?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "I\u2019m going to guess it\u2019s because you can get logs from the parenting app, while screenshots can easily be forged.
