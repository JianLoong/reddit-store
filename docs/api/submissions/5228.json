We had conversations with all of our siblings (all of whom live elsewhere and are coming in town for the party) 2+ months ago clarifying that there were two options: \n\n1. have a babysitter at my parents' house for all of the kids or \n\n2. split the kids up (my siblings are staying at my parents' house, while my BIL & SIL are staying at a hotel) and have two babysitters, meaning that Kate would be alone at the hotel. \n\nWe told them we would arrange one or two babysitters depending on their choice of location and that it would be someone we know and trust. We hung up from BIL & SIL with them saying they were fine with either option. Fast forward to today, SIL calls my husband and says they don't want to leave Kate with a babysitter so they've decided they'll either take the party in shifts - each parent attending the party for half and staying with my niece for the other half - or BIL won't attend at all. According to SIL, BIL will be so concerned about leaving my niece that he'll be a drag at the party.  \n\nI can understand being worried about your kid in a new situation and in a new place, but I feel that we communicated our desires and provided reasonable options that were agreed to and now they are going back on their word.

They solves their dilemma themselves. Why do you have a problem with their solution?", "YTA. They figured out something other than your plan A or B. No child will be in attendance so I don't think you have any reason to complain.", "The title is misleading: the niece will not be at your party, the parents will take turns and stay with the child in another place.\n\n\rNothing changes to you and I don't really understand what your problem is with the solution proposed by SIL.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Neither of the options they decided to go with involved bringing their kid to your party. They aren't obligated to do what you want them to, they're still respecting your desire to not have your niece there. They're just figuring out the way to respect that desire that works best for them.", "I don\u2019t really understand your issue here and I think your title is misleading. No, you\u2019re not an AH for not wanting your niece at the wedding reception. Child-free parties are a thing and it\u2019s totally fine to want that. But your BIL & SIL aren\u2019t even trying to bring your niece to the party. They aren\u2019t comfortable with the options you gave them so they came up with a solution that works for them. They\u2019re the parents and they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re most comfortable with for their child. So what is the issue here? \n\nI guess I\u2019ll say NAH but if you make an issue out of the arrangement they\u2019re most comfortable with (that also still honors your request for a child-free party) then you\u2019d be TA.", "YTA \n\nI thought they were going to insist on bringing the child but they had two good compromises.  They can, but do not have to ,accept one of your options.  It is their child.  Someone you trust isn\u2019t enough.  Why can\u2019t they do it their way?  How controlling are you?", "Info:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhat\u2019s your issue? They aren\u2019t going to bring the kid they just want a parent to watch her where is the problem?", "You know when I read the title I thought they were demanding to bring her and was fully prepared to say N T A however, they aren't.\n\nIn fact they came up with a compromise that works best for their family while still trying to be there for your wedding reception. Not your wedding just the after party. If you have a problem with that then yes YTA . They did not say they're bringing her, they said they will do it in shifts. \n\nYour title should be 'AITA for not wanting my bil and sil to come to my wedding reception in shifts\"", "If you have a problem with their arrangement then YTA. Kids are a priority in a family, and they already covered the way they will handle it. I would respect it the way it is, and its not like they are the center of the attention of the wedding. If you are okay but just concerned about how they will make it work then NTA.", "YTA - You stated 'no kids'. The parents are abiding and created a reasonable solution. You do not get to dictate all aspects of said rule.Parents have the right to decide what is best for their child.", "I'm confused by the thing you're actually asking for judgment on. If it's the question in the title, obviously N T A, there's nothing wrong with a childfree wedding reception. But it feels like you're actually asking 'would I be TA if I demanded my BIL/SIL change their plans if they want to come', which seems totally unnecessary.", "YTA. You\u2019re being selfish. You want them both at the party even after you\u2019ve been told that your brother in law won\u2019t have a good time, because he\u2019s not comfortable leaving his daughter. They\u2019re respecting your boundaries; Kate is not attending your party. They\u2019re also compromising by taking turns to attend the party and to watch their kid. You say you can understand being them worried about their kid, but you don\u2019t. If you did, you\u2019d know that your desires do not trump their concerns.", "NAH. You offered reasonable options, they decided to go with a different solution that doesn\u2019t go against your rule. I thought from the title they\u2019d be pushing to bring her but the post doesn\u2019t sound like it. You\u2019re free to impose the rule, they\u2019re free to decide how to follow it as long as they follow it.", "YTA - You can tell them that the niece is not invited to the party, but you cannot tell them how to arrange child care while they attend. They are not insisting on bringing their child to your childfree wedding - they are not even asking to bring her. They are simply telling you that they do not need you to arrange a baby sitter for them.", "NAH\n\nit sounds like you are being very accommodating for the kids BUT you don't know what Kate is like; her parents do.  Maybe BIL is being over protective OR maybe this little girl has some special issues and it would be a bad idea to leave her with somebody she doesn't know.\n\nThey are not insisting they bring Kate to the wedding; so they've come up with a solution.  They are respecting YOUR No Kids boundary, you should respect theirs.  They're sound like they're doing the best they can.", "YTA.  It\u2019s a wedding reception *invitation*, not a summons - so you can decide who is and isn\u2019t *invited*, but you can\u2019t mandate that they all come.  How the parents of a child decide to handle childcare for an adults-only event is *their* decision, not yours.  And \u201cone of us stays with our kid while the other attends the event\u201d IS a perfectly valid way to handle this, even if it\u2019s not what you would prefer or what you would do in their shoes.  So back off, you\u2019re overstepping.", "NAH.\n\nYou don't want kids at your party, that's fine. They are respecting that, and not even trying to bring her.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m all for child-free parties, but you have to understand that it means some parents won\u2019t be able to attend either. They came up with what should have been an acceptable compromise because they weren\u2019t comfortable with yours. They could have just said to forget it and not traveled in at all.", "NAH\n\nYou're more than within your rights to have a childfree wedding celebration, but it comes at a cost.  And this is the cost right here.  While you can tell parents not to bring their children, you *cannot* tell parents what to do with their children.  That is THEIR call as parents.  \n\nSome will choose to get a sitter, which you kindly offered.  Some will choose not to attend.  And some will choose to do something like this where one parent stays with the child instead of attending.  \n\nSo there's no AH here.  They're respecting your boundaries and wishes in a way that works for them, and you should respect that in turn.  If you try and pressure or push them to leave their child in a situation they have communicated they aren't comfortable with, then *you* cross into AH territory.", "YTA because they ARE respecting you no child rule, just not how you want. Accept and move on.", "YTA\n\nThey\u2019re still respecting your wish for a childfree wedding, just not how you want them to. It\u2019s a you problem.", "You get to decide who is and isn\u2019t invited to your wedding. But that\u2019s where your decisions end. You don\u2019t get to decide who watches other peoples\u2019 children, or if they\u2019re concerned about their child in a strange place.\n\nSIL and BIL have come up with a solution that they are comfortable with and respects your no-kid rules. Be happy with that. YTA", "What\u2019s the problem? Am i reading it wrong? BIL/SIL change their minds and are taking shifts to honor your child free wedding request. Are you asking if your are an AH bc they changed their minds or did you give them a bunch of crap bc they changed their minds and not leaving their daughter with someone they don\u2019t know?", "INFO \n\nThey are not bringing a child to your wedding. Why are you upset???", "YTA. Misleading title, the child won\u2019t be there.", "YTA - the aren't comfortable and came up with a reasonable accomodation.", "YTA. I think when events are made childfree, you are taking a chance with guests who have children to turn you down. The adjustment they have suggested involves no extra effort from your part. If you expect people to understand your decision to a child free event, you should return the favour by being understanding to their concerns. Also, to people saying they agreed first, isn't it normal to change your mind when no major disruptions are anticipated by doing so?", "NAH\n\nThey agreed to it, stewed on it, changed their minds, THEN came to you with a plan already. There's nothing wrong with that, imo. It's not that you didn't do enough, it's more that they want to have her be with a parent and are willing to be flexible to do so. They're not asking you to change the rules for them.\n\nIf you're upset that they changed their minds, it's understandable that you want them both there.", "Congratulations to you and your hubby. I know a lot of friends whose wedding plans got royally screwed by Miss Rona, I'm glad that you two are able to make a party happen. And props to you for being clear about your boundaries from the start.\n\nIn the military, there's a term called \"Commander's Intent\". It refers to the real motivation behind the mission objectives. For example, your squad may have the mission of holding a bridge against enemy forces so that friendlies can cross the bridge for an offensive later. Your objective may be \"prevent the enemy from crossing the bridge\" but if you blow up the bridge, you have violated the Commander's Intent, because what your commander wanted was an intact bridge for your own side's use.\n\nIt sounds like the ILs heard what you said and thought that your overriding Commander's Intent was \"no kids at the wedding\". That's what they're doing.\n\nNAH. Plans change when kids are involved. You're within your rights to be a little annoyed, but this is a small thing and they are trying to adapt in a way that respects your overall wishes. Compared to some of the inlaw wedding bullshit you see on this reddit? This is no big deal.\n\nEnjoy your celebration!", "NTA.\n\nAnd probably best if they don't attend if they plan to make drama.

Many people are extremely worried about leaving their child in someone else\u2019s care, even if it\u2019s a family member or trusted babysitter.
