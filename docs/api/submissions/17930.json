I'm 25 and my fiance is 22 and has this nature \"collection\" when it's really just gross garbage. It's a big box filled with jars of dead bugs, snake skins, rocks and shells, and weird animal spikes and feathers she finds on her walks in the nearby woods. She's had the box for a long while apparently and was collecting for years. Everything she added something to it I would tell her how gross it was and she should get rid of it she would say that it's not gross and she likes collecting it.\n\nYesterday I threw out that box because I got tired of it. I hated having all that junk in my house when she found it gone she was worried she misplaced it and I told her I threw it out because i love her. She got mad and yelled at me saying it's not fair I can collect stuff but she can't and if I can't let her have hobbies or let her leave her stuff without me messing with it that's she's done with me then left.\nSome of out friends that we share messaged me and said I messed up, but when I told my mom about out it she told me that my fiance was being toxic for not respecting my boundaries and getting rid of it earlier because I thought it was gross. \n\nSo am I an asshole?\n\n\n\nEDIT: I understand I'm an asshole. I'll try and call her so I can say sorry about what I did and hopefully I can get her to forgive me", "created_utc": 1684781123, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ozeka/aita_for_throwing_out_my_fianc\u00e9es_nature/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn\u2019t rocket science- you threw out something that belonged to someone else. Just because you don\u2019t value something doesn\u2019t she can\u2019t find value in it. I\u2019m SURE you own things she doesn\u2019t like- and you\u2019d be mad if she threw YOUR stuff out. \n\nHow can you even begin to justify throwing away something that doesn\u2019t belong to you?", "Big fat YTA. It was one box, it was hers, you had no right to touch it.  You sound very controlling and condescending.  I'm so glad she left.", "YTA.\n\n> I threw it out because i love her.\n\nThat is not why. You threw it out because you're controlling and jealous of her hobby. Grow up.", "Yes. YTA.\n\nAnd your mom thinks your FIANCEE was toxic and disrespected YOUR boundaries? I can see where you got your skewed perspective.\n\nThis is mindblowing.\n\nYour fiancee is a whole person who has a right to value the things she values. If she were collecting horsesh\\*t and storing it in the kitchen, that would be one thing, but she's been collecting things in a box.\n\nThere's nothing toxic about having a f\\*cking box to yourself.\n\nThere's definitely something toxic about pruning your partner's hobbies when they don't please you and believing THEY were at fault.", "YTA\n\nGood grief , yes you are absolutely the asshole, how could you honestly think you're not?\n\nYou threw something that was important to your fiance out, thereby telling her that her wants / needs / interests are not important to you.", "YTA. It is her property, not yours. Is that so hard to understand?", "YTA! those are things your partner can't get back. if you didn't like it, don't look at it or touch it, but you had no right to remove it from her without consent. a LOT of people are interested in vulture culture and nature collecting. just because you're not doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it. hope you can learn to be supportive of your partner's interests and hobbies, or that they leave you for someone who can. boo on this post.", "YTA, how ironic that you think she's in the wrong for crossing your boundaries after throwing away her personal belonging that she had told you she's wanted to keep...\n\nAbusers hurt people and call it love. You didn't throw it away because you love her, you threw it away because you didn't like she had something of her own that you couldn't control.", "YTA\n\nWhy would you do that?\n\nIt's not like she was leaving dead bugs and snake skins all over, it was in a box. If it truly bothered you a lot, you could have offered to buy her a nicer box with a lid or cover to remove the \"gross factor\" so you wouldn't be able to see it, and still support her interests.\n\nThrowing out something she had built up over time and held as important to her was a major disrespect of her and does the entire opposite of expressing \"love\" for her, instead veering into controlling territory.\n\nYour mom is also 100% wrong. Your fiance having interests and hobbies that are outside of your own and are not harmful or destructive as long as they're enriched properly (stored well, not developed into a hoarding habit, etc) is part of who she is and is something you should accept. How is her behaviour toxic or infringing on your \"boundary\" of thinking it's \"gross\" (and is easily solvable, again, with a closable container)? Just because neither of you can understand her interest doesn't make that interest a violation of you in the relationship.\n\nYou being willing to discard something behind her back that she cherishes is the toxic behaviour and boundary disrespect going on here. You owe her a massive apology.", "YTA and a controlling, abusive one at that. Your mommy enabling you will continue to lead you to where you are now: alone. \n\nI hope your ex fiance can retrieve her collection or start a new one, and find someone who actually loves her and respects her as an autonomous being with rights.", ">Yesterday I threw out that box because I got tired of it.\n\nYTA, and you 100% are no longer getting married to this person.", "YTA. I hope she blocks you. Your post is bad...but your comments are full of selfishness and disrespect.", "Your mom is the reason YTA. She probably spent your whole life telling you you're right, just because she loves you too much to be honest with you. She may not realise that she ruined you by doing this. \n\nEither that or she hates your girlfriend and is trying to separate you.", "Yes YTA \n\nThe box meant something to her, she was collecting the things for years. You had no right to just throw it out. \n\nAlso important side note:\n\nIf your friends say you messed up and your mom is the only one on your side... you messed up.", "What a gaslighting liar! \u201cBecause you love her.\u201d  YTA", "YTA - I feel like \u201cboundaries\u201d is the new hot word and people will throw it out for anything.

Someone tossing my personal property simply because they find it gross would make my engagement come to a screeching halt.", "You're the absolute asshole, yes. YTA. Do not throw out someone else's things!\n\nYour \"boundaries\" have to do with what does or does not happen to you. Nothing to do with someone else's property. REGARDLESS of whether or not you actually agree with them having it.", "Every damn day there is some self-righteous asshole here, who somehow thinks they have a right to throw out *someone else's property* because They Know Better.\n\nYTA. There is no possible excuse for what you did. You want it gone? DISCUSS IT.", "YTA, and have just given your fianc\u00e9e a very good glimpse into what life with you would be like.  Enjoy being single soon.", "If you want to resolve this, show her this thread, and make sure she sees your comments, too. I guarantee you will never argue with her again.\n\nYTA", "YTA. So is your enabling mom.", "YTA!  You asked her about it, she explained that it was important to her.  Instead of accepting that and moving on, or at least being mature enough to tell her that keeping that box was a deal breaker for you and she had to choose between her collection or living with you, you instead went behind her back and threw it out.  You treated her like a naughty child that brought something \"gross\" into your house.  The reality is that she is an adult, she had a well organized and contained collection, and you got rid of it stealthily to ensure that she couldn't get it back no matter what.\n\nTo add insult to injury, you claim you did it because you love her?  That's total gaslighting.  You did it because you wanted it gone and you don't respect her wants at all.  You know it took her years to gather her collection and some of those pieces might not be able to be replaced even after an equal amount of years looking.  I'm willing to bet you've never asked her what started this collection or what memories are attached that make it so valuable to her.\n\nI truly hope her friends help her to see how disrespectful and childish your actions were and she gets out of this relationship before you destroy anything else...like her self-esteem.", "YTA - On a positive note\u2026 your fianc\u00e9e now knows exactly what she **does** need to get rid of.", "YTA and a HUGE gaping one at that. I keep jars of dead butterflies and moths and dragonflies all over our house (I even have a wee lil baby bunny in a jar of preservatives) and if my husband threw them out it\u2019d be over between us. Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s things were in a BOX and by your own admission it had a lid, so you couldn\u2019t even see them. Exactly WHAT do you find so gross about those things? They\u2019re not going to make you sick or anything. I hope she finds this thread and dumps you.", "YTA.  For her sake, I hope it's ex-fianc\u00e9 soon.", "YTA - a huge gaping nasty AH. \n\nIt\u2019s rich that you and your mother would discuss \u201cboundaries\u201d and somehow manage to overlook how wrong it is to dispose of someone else\u2019s property. Truly ugly behavior. Clearly the Apple does not fall far from the tree .", ">> I told her I threw it out because i love her\n\nNo you didn\u2019t. You threw it out because *you* didn\u2019t like it or see value in it, despite knowing that she valued it. The box of nature items wasn\u2019t harming you in any way, you just decided that your opinion of it meant more than your (ex) fianc\u00e9e\u2019s feelings. \n\n>> she told me they my fiance was being toxic for not respecting my boundaries and getting rid of it earlier \n\nYour mom probably shouldn\u2019t speak on anyone else being toxic considering she has you for a son.

Yeah, but it seems like it was contained in one box or jar, so not really in the way. If it\u2019s sitting out, maybe ask to place it in a new spot.  \n\nIf this were truly something that was a deal breaker to you, there needed to be more communication, and there had to be a middle ground.  It seems like the only option was I don't like it so it goes, and when you were told no, you made it that way. That's not how a relationship works.  You didn't toss it away because you love her. You did it away because you hated it more than you love her.", "YTA. Wow, and clueless too.", "Major YTA. I'd have dumped your ass on the spot and I hope she does.\n\nNo matter what was in the box you threw away something that you knew was dear to her and that wasn't a danger to anyone and that's unforgivable.", "Yta I hope you love having a relationship with your mom", "YTA  \n\n\nalso probably not getting to that wedding if you care that little for her", "YTA  Your mom too.", "Oh dear god, I hope she\u2019s not your fianc\u00e9 for long.

Your opinion on her hobbies doesn't matter. Your opinion on her collection doesn't matter. It has absolutely nothing to do with you. If you're grossed out by what she enjoys, then I recommend you grow up. It's not gross, it's natural. \n\nYou know what is gross though? Controlling entitled boyfriends who have no respect for your property or interests.", "YTA.

You're lucky you just got dumped cause my hubby would have slit my throat.", "Info: can you explain what loving her has to do with throwing out her collection?", "YTA\n\nAnd you just violated your fiance's trust in a big way.

You don't get to make that decision for your partner. If you don't want to see that stuff,  you prolly shouldn't date or plan to marry someone who enjoys things you don't find enjoyable or cool. I hope you both reconsider the relationship, because it doesn't seem like you are compatible, and you don't respect your partner. I hope she can find more cool things to regrow her collection. \n\nEspecially YTA since all the little pieces and parts are in a box, not just laying out everywhere.

I hated having all that junk in my house when she found it gone she was worried she misplaced it and I told her I threw it out because i love her.

You\u2019re just choosing not to listen. You\u2019re hoping for internet validation, but didn\u2019t get it. I really hope you get to a point in your life where you remember everyone is allowed to have separate interests. \n\nThe world is not all about you. There\u2019s millions of humans.

You sound insufferable and controlling.", "Why not both?", "So it's okay for you to throw away her stuff but she knows enough not to touch your stuff?

Cheezus Christ on toast OP, there\u2019s the cost and then there\u2019s the sentimental value. \n\nNeither of which you care about and you tossed them like garbage cause YOU consider them garbage. So yes you ARE abusive. YTA.", "Abuse doesn't have to be physical to be abuse. Emotional abuse is still abuse. And that's what applies here. By throwing away the box, you are telling her you don't care about what makes her happy unless it's something that you approve of. Combine that with the comments about how gross and such you find it despite her clearly loving it, you have hurt her without needing to put a single hand on her. That is emotional abuse.", "A box that didn't belong to you, that you knew she wanted to keep.

That's different and not going to happen here. This reminds me of the guy who threw out his girlfriend's crazy sock collection because he didn't like them. They brought her joy, she kept them in a drawer and it literally didn't impact him. But he didn't like her wearing them, so he threw them out and replaced them with plain socks. \n\nYou threw away something that brought her joy because you didn't understand it or like it. It wasn't hurting anything, wasn't creating issues or damage. You didn't like it and rather than respect her property or even ask her to store it elsewhere.
