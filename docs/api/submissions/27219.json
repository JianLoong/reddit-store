When I explained this to my mom, INITIALLY, she was willing to miss the reception & watch the kids as she doesn\u2019t drink & the kids go to bed early (our reception will be a nighttime event past their bedtime).\n\nMy sister, however, called me \u201crude and inconsiderate\u201d for this decision, implying it\u2019s wrong for me to not want my \u201cown niece and nephew at the reception\u201d. She is thinking to not even attend the wedding at all, even though 1. Her kids will miss the RECEPTION, not the WEDDING, and 2. I explained that my mom is willing to watch the kids during the reception.\n\nI talked to my mom to tell her my sister is upset, thinking my mom would support me. Guess what? My mom FLIPS on me, telling me she won\u2019t come to the wedding either if I\u2019m going to exclude her grandkids like that.

It's an adult function anyway, kids usually get bored. You're paying for everything yourself and you want everything just so.\n\nI've been to over 100 weddings (I used to bartend for a catering company, yes yes *are we having fun yet*). While, yes, someone getting drunk and making a mess is common, I've seen more children wreak night-ruining havoc than any other instigator. I've watched fire departments get called because some kid decided that climbing a pergola was a good idea, I've seen children throw so many tantrums because they're bored, usually causing their parents to leave early whether they want to or not (even watched one push an old lady trying to entertain him), I've seen kids take off with balloon arches that were still being used, and I've watched them absolutely destroy a few wedding dressed by smearing cake onto them. If my partner and I ever get married, I sure as hell won't have kids at my reception and I don't blame anyone else for not wanting them there even if they haven't witnessed the social atrocities they're capable of. Especially if you plan on having a red velvet cake.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, instigating a \"child-free\" reception is a gift to all the parents who plan on attending. You're gifting them with a night off to be adults, guilt-free. You get to be the bad guy and parents get a small reprieve which they should all feel entitled to once in a while! It's great! Everyone wins.", "Do adults not realize that children usually never want to go to a wedding or a reception?  I mean, I was dragged to a few when I was 10-15 years old and MY GOD.  So boring.  I would have rather watched paint dry.\n\nNTA and you get to have the kind of reception you want.", "NTA\n\nYOUR wedding.  YOUR choice. \n\nIf you make an exception for your \u201conly niece and nephew\u201d how long before everyone else expects exceptions for their kids. \n\nDon\u2019t back down and enjoy your childfree wedding reception.", "NTA\n\nFind a new officiant so you aren't beholden to whether your parents decide to come. You don't have to fire your dad, but have backup ready.\n\n \n\nIf they'd rather pout than attend the wedding that is on them. It tells you exactly what they prioritize (hint: not you). Because taking over someone else's wedding is bizarre and unhealthy as is refusing to attend your own child's wedding over a child free evening event. If my parents decided to skip my wedding over something like this it would mean an *extreme* change in our relationship going forward. \n\nI hope your wedding goes beautifully, regardless of whether they come (but I hope they do!!).", "I just don't care who comes to anything I invite them to. Come don't come, but don't bully me to get your way. I'd tell them, don't come then. NTA", "NTA. This is your wedding.

We'll miss you.\"\n\nAnything less is an insult to those who played by your rules and arranged childcare.", "NAH. I think the issue is that you want your family there for an entire weekend. Not everyone has someone they can trust to watch the kids for multiple days so the parents can leave them home.

That way your mom won\u2019t have to leave. I don\u2019t get all these people who insist on their kids being at every event. When I was a little kid, I was excited to stay in the hotel room and watch whatever cable TV I wanted. ??? \n\nOur family never has kids at weddings.

Does she usually get her way? Is she the golden child?. I\u2019d go back on having the kids for the ceremony if I were you and tell her if she\u2019s going to be this way and make this much fuss than it\u2019s too much and they all shouldn\u2019t come.

Sounds like your mom, sis & kids may not be at your wedding/reception at all. Their loss. Have your event how you want it. If they miss it they are very difficult people who need to not be there. However it seems weird to have the kids in ceremony & not at reception. I, of course,  would go nuclear & say that I've changed my mind & don't want ring bearer or flower girl.

You\u2019re asking your loved ones to celebrate this day with you\u2026but telling them their beloved children, your nieces and nephews, aren\u2019t welcome. It always sounds wrong because frankly, in my opinion it is wrong. \n\nHonestly, I never understood not wanting kids at a reception. Kids are great at receptions, they dance and have a ball and everyone gets a kick out of them. They also are the kids of others who usually just got married themselves not along ago and so it\u2019s nice seeing the family grow before your eyes. \n\nI don\u2019t know, to each his own I guess.

May not have been wise to let the kids @ the wedding because that opened the door to them being @ the reception.\n\nThis is a very popular issue on this forum. I think people should be free to have a childfree wedding, but you do have to expect pushback from it.

You aren\u2019t wrong for not wanting kids at the reception, that\u2019s your choice, however you are wrong for not being willing to accept your family\u2019s choice in not attending bc of that rule. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to demand everyone respects your choices while you act a brat over theirs. They\u2019ve said they won\u2019t come if you don\u2019t include the kids.

But, do not be surprised when your rules mean people no longer wish to attend. They are not obligated to attend, you see.\n\nAs much as 3 days off to party seems amazing when you are young and childless, it is a massive bother to those with children. 24 hour childcare for 3 days is not always something you can arrange without hurdles. And this is also a shocker: Parents generally like their children and consider them a core part of the family.\n\nThis seems very much a case of you wanting your special day and consideration for other people is not on the agenda.

I agree it\u2019s your wedding and you plan it as you want it. However a multi day event is a big ask for not seeing one\u2019s children. Don\u2019t be surprised if your guest list shrinks.", "I think it\u2019s odd that\u2019s you seem upset that your family may not turn up at your wedding when you haven\u2019t invited your family to the wedding? You seem ok with them missing parts so you don\u2019t have your nice and nephew there? I mean each to their own and all but surely it\u2019s one of the best parts of a wedding- celebrating this new big family all together.", "YTA child-free weddings are absolutely unacceptable", "YTA.\n\nIt would be fine if you kept the entire wedding child-free, but letting them go to your wedding & then saying they are not allowed at the reception is *not* how it works. Some people invite *more* people to the reception if they have an intimate wedding, but you can\u2019t have them at the wedding & not the reception. That\u2019s not fair to them, it\u2019s not fair to their parents & it\u2019s extremely poor etiquette. This isn\u2019t a \u2018boundary\u2019 issue.

You're not excluding her kids because you don't care for them, you're doing it for her benefit. Suggest she asks others who have brought their kids (6ish & under) to weddings how it worked out. I can guarantee 90% or more will say they couldn't enjoy themselves & would love a night to let their hair down. \n\nFeel free to share my story with your sister, which I've heard isn't unique - My daughter (2 at the time) was one of the flower girls in my sisters wedding, which I was MOH for. There were a total of 6 kids under 6 as flower girls & ring bearers, plus my then 12 year old nephew who were going to walk down the aisle at their mostly casual, family friendly wedding. My nephew was going to take care of my daughter, since she was the only one on our side & she adores my nephew. At the last minute, she threw herself on the floor & everyone turned to see what was going on. My partner was sitting on the aisle near the back to grab her if needed (then move to the front next to my parents), my mom in the front to grab her if she made it down. I ended up slinging her on my hip, trying not to drop my huge bouquet while she squirmed in my arms as I walked down the aisle. My partner tried to grab her, but she refused, so I kept going. She did go to my mom eventually. Fortunately the ceremony & reception we're at a large B&B property, so daddy took her back to our room for a nap right after the ceremony while I did bridal party pics. Then my cousins stayed in the room while she napped so my partner & I could be in the family pics. Everyone was so kind to take more after she woke up & was happy as can be. But we still couldn't fully enjoy ourselves at the reception, as one of us always had to be watching her. My parents took turns dancing with her for a short time, but I didn't want to pawn her off on them.", "Don't give in.
