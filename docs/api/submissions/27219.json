When I explained this to my mom, INITIALLY, she was willing to miss the reception & watch the kids as she doesn\u2019t drink & the kids go to bed early (our reception will be a nighttime event past their bedtime).\n\nMy sister, however, called me \u201crude and inconsiderate\u201d for this decision, implying it\u2019s wrong for me to not want my \u201cown niece and nephew at the reception\u201d. She is thinking to not even attend the wedding at all, even though 1. Her kids will miss the RECEPTION, not the WEDDING, and 2. I explained that my mom is willing to watch the kids during the reception.\n\nI talked to my mom to tell her my sister is upset, thinking my mom would support me. Guess what? My mom FLIPS on me, telling me she won\u2019t come to the wedding either if I\u2019m going to exclude her grandkids like that.

It's an adult function anyway, kids usually get bored. You're paying for everything yourself and you want everything just so.\n\nI've been to over 100 weddings (I used to bartend for a catering company, yes yes *are we having fun yet*). While, yes, someone getting drunk and making a mess is common, I've seen more children wreak night-ruining havoc than any other instigator. I've watched fire departments get called because some kid decided that climbing a pergola was a good idea, I've seen children throw so many tantrums because they're bored, usually causing their parents to leave early whether they want to or not (even watched one push an old lady trying to entertain him), I've seen kids take off with balloon arches that were still being used, and I've watched them absolutely destroy a few wedding dressed by smearing cake onto them. If my partner and I ever get married, I sure as hell won't have kids at my reception and I don't blame anyone else for not wanting them there even if they haven't witnessed the social atrocities they're capable of. Especially if you plan on having a red velvet cake.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, instigating a \"child-free\" reception is a gift to all the parents who plan on attending. You're gifting them with a night off to be adults, guilt-free. You get to be the bad guy and parents get a small reprieve which they should all feel entitled to once in a while! It's great! Everyone wins.", "Do adults not realize that children usually never want to go to a wedding or a reception?  I mean, I was dragged to a few when I was 10-15 years old and MY GOD.  So boring.  I would have rather watched paint dry.\n\nNTA and you get to have the kind of reception you want.", "NTA\n\nYOUR wedding.  YOUR choice. \n\nIf you make an exception for your \u201conly niece and nephew\u201d how long before everyone else expects exceptions for their kids. \n\nDon\u2019t back down and enjoy your childfree wedding reception.", "NTA\n\nFind a new officiant so you aren't beholden to whether your parents decide to come. You don't have to fire your dad, but have backup ready.\n\n \n\nIf they'd rather pout than attend the wedding that is on them. It tells you exactly what they prioritize (hint: not you). Because taking over someone else's wedding is bizarre and unhealthy as is refusing to attend your own child's wedding over a child free evening event. If my parents decided to skip my wedding over something like this it would mean an *extreme* change in our relationship going forward. \n\nI hope your wedding goes beautifully, regardless of whether they come (but I hope they do!!).", "I just don't care who comes to anything I invite them to. Come don't come, but don't bully me to get your way. I'd tell them, don't come then. NTA", "NTA. This is your wedding.

We'll miss you.\"   Remember, their loving response is to insult and bully you.\n\nYou gave in on the wedding, and they're pushing on the reception. You give in on the reception, they'll push on something else, then another thing and another and another until you won't even recognize your own wedding,", "NAH\n\nYou have a right to ban kids from your wedding.

We'll miss you.\"\n\nAnything less is an insult to those who played by your rules and arranged childcare.", "NAH. I think the issue is that you want your family there for an entire weekend. Not everyone has someone they can trust to watch the kids for multiple days so the parents can leave them home.

That way your mom won\u2019t have to leave. I don\u2019t get all these people who insist on their kids being at every event. When I was a little kid, I was excited to stay in the hotel room and watch whatever cable TV I wanted. ??? \n\nOur family never has kids at weddings.

Does she usually get her way? Is she the golden child?. I\u2019d go back on having the kids for the ceremony if I were you and tell her if she\u2019s going to be this way and make this much fuss than it\u2019s too much and they all shouldn\u2019t come.

Sounds like your mom, sis & kids may not be at your wedding/reception at all. Their loss. Have your event how you want it. If they miss it they are very difficult people who need to not be there. However it seems weird to have the kids in ceremony & not at reception. I, of course,  would go nuclear & say that I've changed my mind & don't want ring bearer or flower girl.

You\u2019re asking your loved ones to celebrate this day with you\u2026but telling them their beloved children, your nieces and nephews, aren\u2019t welcome. It always sounds wrong because frankly, in my opinion it is wrong. \n\nHonestly, I never understood not wanting kids at a reception. Kids are great at receptions, they dance and have a ball and everyone gets a kick out of them. They also are the kids of others who usually just got married themselves not along ago and so it\u2019s nice seeing the family grow before your eyes. \n\nI don\u2019t know, to each his own I guess.

May not have been wise to let the kids @ the wedding because that opened the door to them being @ the reception.\n\nThis is a very popular issue on this forum. I think people should be free to have a childfree wedding, but you do have to expect pushback from it.

They\u2019ve said they won\u2019t come if you don\u2019t include the kids.

But, do not be surprised when your rules mean people no longer wish to attend. They are not obligated to attend, you see.\n\nAs much as 3 days off to party seems amazing when you are young and childless, it is a massive bother to those with children. 24 hour childcare for 3 days is not always something you can arrange without hurdles. And this is also a shocker: Parents generally like their children and consider them a core part of the family.\n\nThis seems very much a case of you wanting your special day and consideration for other people is not on the agenda.

I agree it\u2019s your wedding and you plan it as you want it. However a multi day event is a big ask for not seeing one\u2019s children. Don\u2019t be surprised if your guest list shrinks.", "I think it\u2019s odd that\u2019s you seem upset that your family may not turn up at your wedding when you haven\u2019t invited your family to the wedding? You seem ok with them missing parts so you don\u2019t have your nice and nephew there? I mean each to their own and all but surely it\u2019s one of the best parts of a wedding- celebrating this new big family all together.", "YTA child-free weddings are absolutely unacceptable", "YTA.\n\nIt would be fine if you kept the entire wedding child-free, but letting them go to your wedding & then saying they are not allowed at the reception is *not* how it works. Some people invite *more* people to the reception if they have an intimate wedding, but you can\u2019t have them at the wedding & not the reception. That\u2019s not fair to them, it\u2019s not fair to their parents & it\u2019s extremely poor etiquette. This isn\u2019t a \u2018boundary\u2019 issue.

You can have whomever you want at your wedding.", "NTA. You and your groom do it the way you want. Tell them to suck lemons.", "NTA. The only way time I believe the wedding couple are TA in a child free wedding is if they are guilting the wedding refusal of someone with children.\n\nYour NTA to want your wedding childfree and accept this means some will not be able to attend.\n\nYour guests are NTA if they graciously decline due to childcare.\n\nYour mom and sister are TAs for trying to manipulate and guilt you. They don\u2019t get to dictate who must be at your wedding.\n\nYou are handling this with grace. You mom is being really terrible. Continue being firm, saying your sorry they won\u2019t be able to attend and try not to give into manipulation. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding.", "NTA\n\nIt's your event -- I suspect the fact that you gave in to your pushy mom about having the niece/nephew at the wedding was like handing her ammo to make another demand until you are having the wedding SHE wants, not the wedding you want.\n\nSo -  let them cool off and when they ask for this \"family meeting\" just tell them that there's really no need.  Your wedding is adult only and if that's just not something your parents or your sister can deal with, they're obviously not adult enough to attend.", "NTA.  Your wedding.  If they decide to miss it, that is on them.", "Tell mom and sister your sorry they won't be at the wedding and reception however since they didn't find the compromise of having the kids in the wedding instead of having a completely child free wedding and reception you are returning to the original plan of a child free wedding and reception. Tell dad your sorry that your sisters disrespectful behavior and attitude about YOUR wedding has denied him the chance and his right to walk you down the aisle so that you still have a dad person to walk you down the aisle you will be asking your future fil to do the honor of walking you down the aisle. Tell them all your wedding is about YOU not any of them.", "Info: Can anyone else besides your mom or sister watch her kids?\n\nIf your sister had no other options for childcare besides your mom - then if you want to keep this child free you\u2019ll exclude your sister.  \n\nThen your mom might decide to not be there too in solidarity with your sister.\n\nIf that is how you want to start your marriage then you be you. But understand that you will become estranged from your family over this.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that makes you TA, but (to me) this seems pretty crazy.  The kids will probably fall asleep at the reception or your mom or sister will leave early.", "We'll get together after the honeymoon!  And you can have anyone you want at your house since you will, of course, be hosting.", "NTA. Your sister and your mom are still unhappy because they expected you to cave. Please don't let them manipulate you like that. Tell them you're sorry they won't be there and offer to let them see the videos. Happy wedding!", "To add to this:\n\nI've also seen children get hurt because NO ADULT is actually watching them.  We all assume someone else is doing it - especially when there are multiple kids from different families playing together.\n\nAdd in alcohol and getting engaged in fun conversations with other adults for once, the parents slip up.\n\nIf there is a very mindful parent, they aren't even having fun because they are worried about their kid killing themselves.", "Iykyk. Great advice from a professional. Heed her.", "How does this work when you have no one to leave your child with for several days?", "If they dont care about what the bride wants they damn sure dont care about what the kids want. Im always impressed with how people make events not about them all about them.", "This, this, 1000% this !", "scrolled to look for this answer.  Nothing wrong with personal preference.  Said personal preference may cause some people to not want or be unable to attend.  Nobody an ahole for this.", "Good one. These family mbrs are absolutely emotional terrorists. Be strong OP.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "It is normal & if they are at the reception I've always seen a separate area set up for them w various carers organizing activities, food etc so they have their own fun party segregated from the adults.", "I had kids at my wedding and it was fun but your overly romanticizing it. Especially if the reception is past the kids bedtime. There\u2019s tantrums, breaking things, screaming and usually the parents aren\u2019t parenting leaving everyone else to. It\u2019s definitely not wrong to not want kids. It\u2019s a personal choice and since she\u2019s paying for the party she gets to make that decision. I\u2019d never tell anyone paying for a party what they can and can\u2019t do", "I wouldn\u2019t want kids there. They\u2019re annoying & I just don\u2019t find it \u2018cute\u2019. That said, the only issue with OP is her lack of etiquette. If it\u2019s child-free, she either needs to stick to that for *everything* or the kids that are in the wedding party should attend the reception. It\u2019s tacky to invite people to the ceremony & not invite them to a reception.", "\u201cKids are great at receptions\u201d. Sure. Except for when they scream, shout, throw up, soil themselves, pull the table cloths (and 8 plates full of food plus n drinks) on the floor. Yeah, amazing. /s", "That\u2019s exactly the problem - inviting anyone too the wedding & *not* the reception doesn\u2019t fly. It doesn\u2019t matter who is paying.\n\nChild-free wedding & reception is 100% fine - but she can\u2019t have them at the ceremony & then say they can\u2019t come to the reception. If she reverses that to no children at all, she won\u2019t be TA. As it stands? She is.", "It absolutely \\*is\\* how it works. It's their wedding. There are free to establish whatever rules they want for the ceremony and the reception. If her sister doesn't want to go, that's fine, that's her prerogative. But OP is more than free to have kids at her ceremony and not the reception.", "Not sure where you are pulling this from, but you are extremely off base here. It is their wedding and their reception and they can have it however they want. They compromised to allow the two younger kids to be part of the wedding, but there's no obligation to have them at the reception. Again it is a night time event, for adults, past their bedtime. \n\nBut I agree, they shouldn't let the two kids come to the wedding either. No reason to compromise because someone else decided to have children.", "You say this with no concept of how difficult it is to find someone to watch your kids for three days.  OP says this is a multi-day wedding.  If OP\u2019s mom and sister (and I assume the kid\u2019s other parent) are away from home for three days - who watches the kids at home?  \n\nIf they take the kids with them - who watches the kids in this new location that they know no one at?  \n\nMy kids are 8-15 and my husband and I have been with our kids every night since my oldest  came home from the hospital because that is what it means to be a parent.", "you hire somebody or just dont go?", "Pretty soon you might as well give the whole celebration, ceremony, reception & the Airbnb (which I think was a wonderfully generous & way cool thing to do) to your mom & sister to do with as they wish & simply elope.", "I\u2019ve been to dozens of weddings, literally never have seen any of that from kids.
