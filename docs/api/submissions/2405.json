Or has his wife had to choose each year between her family or her husband's family?", "NTA.\n\nDon't bother going to your brother's house.  It is too much given your situation.  You can see the house and that family another time.  It's their choice to limit attendance and your non-attendance is the consequence of their choice.\n\nDon't cook.  Have guests bring the food (or most of it).  Order what needs to be filled in or just order the entire meal.  Many restaurants, groceries, and caterers have menus that they sell.  Spend your time relaxing and enjoying the company.", "NTA.  As others have said your brother and SIL can invite or not invite anyone they want to their house.  I do wonder if there was a communication issue between your brother and SIL which if true is their issue and not yours.  With you diagnosis, think about converting this Thanksgiving to something that doesn't involve hosting or ease it some by having it catered.  Your in-laws will most likely understand considering your current health.  My family had to do this and everything was fine.  You get to see everyone without all of the work.  Going to a restaurant tied to some other activity that isn't usually performed could get some good memories as well.  Get creative and have fun.", "NTA. But have you spoken to your brother about this? I'm wondering if his wife has even told him she's uninvited your in-laws.  It's best to check if he was involved in this decision before you make a move", "NTA\nYour brother is an AH for volunteering to host and not making his thanksgiving inclusive especially considering everything you are going through.", "NTA\n\nDo a potluck style dinner or catering to take the stress off of you. It's a life saver.\n\nUnless your in laws have done something egregious to your SIL, I don't see how two people would make such a difference, considering you've hosted her for many years. But, it's their house, so not much to argue about.\n\nTell you brother in an up front, non-confrontational way that since your SIL said that's how they feel, you'll respect it and host your in laws at your home. I don't blame you for feeling awkward after carrying the tradition for so long and feeling put off.", "NTA I would make sure you give your parents a heads up then text your brother and let them know that you appreciate the invite and when you accepted you where under the appreciation your in-laws where invited also. You are sorry for the misunderstanding but you can\u2019t let them have no place to go so you are hosting a small thanksgiving with them.\n\nThen call a place have everything catered and enjoy the laid back thanksgiving.", "NTA- he can either have everyone, or recognize that not everyone will be there. It's very simple.", "NTA.\n\nThey seem to be missing the whole concept of inclusivity that is the point of TDay. \n\nIt\u2019s my fave holiday and I love to host\u2014the more the merrier. I often have non family members join if they don\u2019t have plans. \n\nI think that them excluding your in-laws is garbage. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re strangers. \n\nI think more discussion is needed. If they\u2019re hard set that your in-laws aren\u2019t invited then yeah, do your thing. Consider having it catered though so it\u2019s less work for you or make it a potluck.", "NTA...\nBut since they are hosting they have the right to invite who they want at their home...you would think after spending Thanksgiving with your in-laws at your home your S-I-L would consider them family...\nI've been married for a bit over 25 years now and have never had a blended family holiday...I tried once~and was told by my husband's fam no...it's always been just their family and that's the way it will stay(and I was having it at OUR house!). I've never forgotten about that...and in all these years I've only hosted 2 holiday dinners. \nIf you feel strongly about your in-laws being left out...stay home...and have the holiday at ur house...but if ur not up to cooking and I'm sure ur in-laws would understand ~maybe you can go out to eat instead? I know it's hard to hurt people's feelings (ur brother) but just worry about yourself...\nHolidays sometimes just are too stressful \ud83d\ude41...", "NAH....I guess. People have to alternate years and families all the time for holidays. I think it's a little odd to assume **your** in-laws would be invited to your brother's house for Thanksgiving. But, by the same token, it's not too weird to tell bro that you'll seem them next year or something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s 2 people they have spent numerous holidays with before. Talk to your brother. Your SIL is a huge AH!", "INFO: What did your brother say to this? From your post it seems he was onboard with your in-laws coming and only SIL is saying no. Have you asked him or are you trying to save him a headache? Seems as if his wife went behind his back to disinvite your in-laws. SIL TA", "Send your brother the text and let him know that unfortunately, you will not be able to attend \n\nAlso let him know that you have already made plans with the inlaws and that even if he smooths things over with his wife, you will not be attending because you now know that your inlaws are not welcome and that his wife will likely make them feel unwelcome if they were to attend\n\nThen call up the inlaws, explain the situation, and do a lazy thanksgiving.\n\nWhat's a lazy thanksgiving?\n\nOne year my mom didn't feel like doing all the work for a traditional Thanksgiving.\n\nSo we grilled steaks and did baked potatoes, french fries, cornbread and had storebought pie for desert.\n\nNobody dressed up...we just wore jeans and sweatshirts and enjoyed a comfortable day of spending time with the family\n\nPerhaps you can do something like that with your inlaws\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Sounds like your brother was on board with your in laws coming until he told his wife.  You could possibly reach out to her and explain that since she offered to host \"Thanksgiving\" this year due to your medical diagnosis,  and that you had understood that \"everyone\" who normally attends when you host, would be included.  You can nicely ask if she would reconsider  and allow your in laws to attend.  If she says no, then you can tell her you are very disappointed but you will have to decline their invitation so you can prepare Thanksgiving for them and it will be much harder without your mom to help you and due to your medical diagnosis\n\nMy guess is she has invited HER relatives and friends and that is why she is excluding your inlaws", "NTA.  Simply state \" I was under the impression that it was the same thanksgiving we have every year but moving it to a different house this year.  But since that isn't the plan anymore, we'll just go back and do our own thing as usual because you can't dis-invite family from an annual tradition.\"", "NAH - Considering that your SIL has no real connection with your partner's parents, it makes sense that they wouldn't be invited to her party.  And, it's okay that you say, \"no\".  Yes, your brother will be upset.  You're his sister after all.  But if he's not the vindictive type he'll get over it quickly and hope to see you afterward.  Just say no with tact.", "Not sure if YTA, but your brother and SIL seem to have really crappy communication between themselves.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But why would you expect your sister to invite YOUR inlaws? Did she give you any indication she would invite them?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is nothing bad here. You have made plans without your inlaws for thanksgiving. Nothing wrong with that. They can make their own plans, they just failed to do so yet. Or they wrongly assumed they were invited without actually ever receiving an invitation. THat is solely THEIR fault. If you told them they were invited, it is your fault you lied to them. SIL and brother did nothing wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you can solve this for your inlaws, or let them make their own plans. Just as you prefer. If you want them invited, you have to host them. Or you can visit them. Or you can have thanksgiving without them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOUR choice if you decide to make this YOUR drama.

Did you confirm with your brother that your inlaws are not invited?", "NTA, but it's very odd that your SIL would have offered to take over Thanksgiving only because you are suffering medically, otherwise I'm sure the show would go on at your house with your in-laws and everyone attending as usual. I understand she can have whomever she wants in her own home, but it kind of defeats the purpose of her taking it over in the first place if you are still having to put on a Thanksgiving due to her not allowing your in-laws to  attend her event.", "YTA why would you assume YOUR in-laws are invited to the house of people they\u2019re not related to?\n\nManners would\u2019ve dictated asking the hostess and not just assuming you\u2019re still in charge of the guest list when not the hostess.", "Yes, I've always invited them. Only her sister and brother in law have attended in the past because their parents usually host their own gathering. But this year my brother and sister in law are hosting both.", "What a great idea to order the whole meal. Definitely looking into this. Thank you for that suggestion!", "I really like this idea!

OP only assumed they were invited.", "We've had the same people at my house for thanksgiving for years and the discussion was that we would be moving thanksgiving to their house this year.

So he is the real AH since he didn't bother to tell OP himself and instead set his wife up to be the bad guy.

That way they know the true reason.", "Last couple of years my family did that. I think it was $40 at Hannafords and we got a deboned turkey, stuffing, squash, gravy, and mashed potatoes that just needed to be heated up to be ready to eat. Add some corn and green beans on the side. Very low-stress.", "SIL is hosting the family get-together because OP cannot this year - that was explicitly discussed as the reason when SIL offered. It was reasonable to assume that the guest list would be unchanged, because SIL is effectively acting on OP's behalf. And since OP always invites SIL's family, it was again reasonable to assume that SIL would include OP's husband's family. Effectively, the in-laws have a standing invitation.", "Yeah ... those were YOUR guests.

But I think it's a bit AH on the SIL part to tell her at last minute too.", "But when OP mentioned her in laws were excited to see the house her brother responded that he was excited to have everyone together. And then they made plans for who was bringing what food, which more than likely included the in-laws. \n\nThat seems like they were invited.", "OP didn't mention earlier that she thought they were invited. So what reason would OP have to start a discussin about it? To THEM everything was clear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen OP mentioned it to her brother - FOR THE FIRST TIME, he was likely surprised but wanted to ask SIL if SHE had invited OPs inlaws before making a statement. That's the polite and normal thing to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen he discussed it with his wife, and the next day they called OP to clear up OP's missconception.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompletely reasonable way to handle it, from SIL'S and brother's side.", "You're right."]}
