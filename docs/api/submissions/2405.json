You can see the house and that family another time.  It's their choice to limit attendance and your non-attendance is the consequence of their choice.\n\nDon't cook.

Your in-laws will most likely understand considering your current health.  My family had to do this and everything was fine.  You get to see everyone without all of the work.

Or perhaps they did not realize that it would put you and your partner in such a tough situation. IDK but I don't think this was malicious - just unfortunate holiday stress and circumstance! Moving forward just be clear and deliberate communicating your decision, make sure they know there are no hard feelings and that they are welcome to invite whoever they want, but that you and your partner have decided that making sure you in laws have family to spend the holiday with is an important priority for you both.

Explain that you had assumed that your in-laws could attend, and since you don\u2019t want to leave them alone and it\u2019s a bit last minute for them to make other plans, you\u2019ll be doing thanksgiving with them. If that conversation goes poorly \u2026 well then your brother and his wife might be AHs, but i imagine they\u2019d understand", "NTA. I hope that your able to beat whatever your medical diagnosis is. SIL is messed up for her last minute change on who is allowed at her new home for Thanksgiving especially with your diagnosis. I hope that you are able to have a relaxing Thanksgiving with zero drama at home with those who are most important in your life.", "Nta", "Catering is the way. You don't have to exhaust yourself to have a nice meal with your family", "I need to hear about your traditional Thanksgiving.", "I am in agreement;  OP's in-laws are not SIL and Op's brother family.  OP is not the hostess this year so it is a different situation.", "One year, we made a reservation at a restaurant for Thanksgiving. Everyone with the space to host had a lot going on and no one wanted to do it. Honestly, it was kind of a crappy experience because we could only get in at the end of the day, so they were down to the last dregs of dried out turkey and they had run out of pumpkin pie. But we still got to spend the time together, no one had to cook or clean, and it gave a renewed enthusiasm for someone to host the following year, haha. Sometimes you need to change things up, and even if it\u2019s a fail, it\u2019s worth it to give you a break.", "Whole Foods (if you have one nearby) does an amazing Thanksgiving... but almost every large grocery store does this now.", "Whole Foods also does this.", "Boston Market has an amazing cooked turkey if you have one near you. Get the sides, make some Stove Top and Pillsbury biscuits and call it a day.", "My parents started doing this a few years ago and it's great! We're very casual and use chinet dishes (we've learned our lesson and spring for the extra heavy plastic ones for holiday meals) and disposable cups and paper napkins for the main which is catered by a local deli. The deli even supplies the bread baskets and serving trays and it all comes in a professionally insulated hot box. When you're done all the deli's dishes go into the hot box and that's returned a few hours later. The only thing my parents have to do is wash the silverware and dessert plates, because they prefer their their own- and those are quick (mom likes to use it as a quick break from hostessing tbh). We keep telling them to just order pizza, lol. It's about family not the food!", "I'm sorry I don't get why you would think YOUR in-laws would be invited to a house that has zero relationship with them? YTA Why would your in-laws be expected to be invited too, can't they sort their own Thanksgiving out? Your SILs life does not revolve around you, they have their own in-laws.", "I\u2019ve done the Whole Foods one and it was pretty reasonable and quite good !", "Be careful about where you go to get the entire meal. Check reviews. Look at the turkey before you walk out of the store. My mom ordered a turkey last year and it was overcooked with BURNT drippings on the bottom of the pan. \n\nIt really is a good idea, just check reviews on the store (filter to Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner).", "I do Whole Foods and you get a lot of food.", "Or go out to eat, our family has done this for a long time. Unless you don't feel up to getting dressed up to dine out.", "Before doing all that, have you checked with your brother to make sure this is what he wants too? There have been plenty of times on here where one partner goes behind another's back to exclude people.", "The HoneyBaked Ham company has amazing turkey and sides! Make sure to order ASAP though, as it's highly popular!", "This sounds like a miscommunication between your brother and SIL.  I honestly don\u2019t think it was malicious. Maybe she\u2019s just worried that it\u2019s too many people especially if they\u2019ve not yet hosted a holiday in their new home?", "I just moved into a shitty share house while I look to buy a home in a nice touristy area.  A few of my friends are coming down for thanksgiving and were literally just getting Chinese food and watching LOTR. Then on Friday were going to Hmart and getting Kbbq.", "I wonder if brother even knows she uninvited OP's in-laws?", "Looking at the post her brother seemed to be okay and thought the same as OP. It might be a case of miscommunication but I think OP thought SIL was doing this as a way to help because OP\u2019s diagnosis.", "INFO: Are you the SIL?"]}
