He watched them treat you like dirt & chose to turn a blind eye.", "[removed]", "Strong vibes of \"doing the bare minimum, expecting effusions of gratitude\" here. \n\nYour dad never tried to create a smooth transition towards blended family. He knew how abandoned and alone you felt. He let the situation go on because what mattered most was not being single anymore, not your wellbeing and feeling accepted and loved in your own home, which is basically a child's only/principal safe space. He can't go pikachu face when the step-siblings who were never interested in you are still not interested in you or in your kid. And he can't go pikachu face because you don't care that, now that you're an adult, you don't care either about them. \n\nYour dad sounds so self-centered, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that his relationship with your step-mother was not going well and he decided to make it implode in a way that \"makes him look good\" and would \"make you gain his respect\". Or something. Because what was the point of moving out, over an issue between grown children, right now? When the relationship was new and going well, it did not matter that your step siblings were casting you out. Now, he's expecting to be hailed as a hero.\n\nAnother brilliant case of FAFO. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - I think you hit the nail on the head.

Oh, I know!  Being ignored and discounted throughout your childhood **builds character**!!  I bet you're just brimming with character now and it's all his doing!\n\nOn a more serious note, I'm very sorry you had to go through that but it's very impressive that you have built a family of your own and stood firm against his \"too little/too late\" line of crap.  Good for you!", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry for your experience and you have to protect your piece of mind and family. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an added level of perspective now that you have your own kid.", "NTA for being angry at his lack of parenting and his bad choices over the years that resulted in your very unhappy childhood. However, it may be good for you, your gf and your baby girl if you can hash this out with grandpa. He should apologize, make amends, etc. Sounds like he's taken steps in that direction. Yes, it would have been better that he did so many years ago, but at least he's doing it now. My father died without ever making a single step toward mending our rift. At least your father's trying. But it will take time and effort, you have every right to your pain, anger and disappointment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
