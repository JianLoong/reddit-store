He watched them treat you like dirt & chose to turn a blind eye.", "[removed]", "Strong vibes of \"doing the bare minimum, expecting effusions of gratitude\" here. \n\nYour dad never tried to create a smooth transition towards blended family. He knew how abandoned and alone you felt. He let the situation go on because what mattered most was not being single anymore, not your wellbeing and feeling accepted and loved in your own home, which is basically a child's only/principal safe space. He can't go pikachu face when the step-siblings who were never interested in you are still not interested in you or in your kid. And he can't go pikachu face because you don't care that, now that you're an adult, you don't care either about them. \n\nYour dad sounds so self-centered, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that his relationship with your step-mother was not going well and he decided to make it implode in a way that \"makes him look good\" and would \"make you gain his respect\". Or something. Because what was the point of moving out, over an issue between grown children, right now? When the relationship was new and going well, it did not matter that your step siblings were casting you out. Now, he's expecting to be hailed as a hero.\n\nAnother brilliant case of FAFO. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - I think you hit the nail on the head. Why is he suddenly concerned with this?\n\nI wonder if there were other issues in his marriage he didn't want to address, and is using this as a smoke screen.", "NTA - Ummm, just exactly what were you supposed to be grateful *for*?  Oh, I know!  Being ignored and discounted throughout your childhood **builds character**!!  I bet you're just brimming with character now and it's all his doing!\n\nOn a more serious note, I'm very sorry you had to go through that but it's very impressive that you have built a family of your own and stood firm against his \"too little/too late\" line of crap.  Good for you!", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry for your experience and you have to protect your piece of mind and family. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an added level of perspective now that you have your own kid.", "NTA for being angry at his lack of parenting and his bad choices over the years that resulted in your very unhappy childhood. However, it may be good for you, your gf and your baby girl if you can hash this out with grandpa. He should apologize, make amends, etc. Sounds like he's taken steps in that direction. Yes, it would have been better that he did so many years ago, but at least he's doing it now. My father died without ever making a single step toward mending our rift. At least your father's trying. But it will take time and effort, you have every right to your pain, anger and disappointment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He can't just throw you to the wolves for most of your life and then think he's made amends to you because of your daughter. He never made amends on your behalf. Let him stew in his own AH juice.", "NTA. \n\nPeople need to hear these things.", "NTA I get where ur coming from but he did blow up his marriage atleast his seeing the error of his ways now maybe u could give him a chance now n see if u guys can rebuild ur relationship", ">I like you, OP. Tell your failure of a ~~father~~ *human* to go back to the shitty people he placed above you and enjoy your life with your new baby.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t earned that title.", "NTA. This is like textbook example of to little to late", "NTA\nHe wanted to left and used you as an excuse.", "NTA. He is an adult and responsible for his own relationship decisions. And trying to make you owe him for it shows that he is still not centering you or considering your emotional needs.", "NTA.\nThere is something to be said for trying to mend fences. But he should have asserted himself in this regard when you were younger. Her kids should never have been given the green light to treat you that way.\nThe way I see it, you did what you had to do, gratitude is something he has no right to expect.", "My cynical side concurs, and adds that it's likely because he only really realized after the divorce that his stepchildren never really cared for *him* either, after they told him to GTFO because he's not their kids' grandfather after he tried to visit.", "No he didn't. \n\nHe probably wanted to leave and used OP's daughter as an excuse to save face.", "Nope. He blew up his marriage because that was what he wanted. And he used OP to save face. No one watches their kid be bullied for 10+ years and wake up one day feeling like an avenger", "Yeah...my cynical ass thinks that this only happened because of ~~totally expected by everyone except him~~ \"unexpected\" consequences on the dad's side, like his former step children telling him to GTFO because he's not *their* kids' grandfather.", "Oh totally possible.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nUngrateful? For what? For being bullied through your whole childhood and your dad standing there doing nothing?\n\nHis marriage is his problem, not yours.

The part I don't understand is why in the hell would you care if her kids like you or not? I wouldn't... But maybe that's just me. Life is what YOU make it, not expect people to cater to you that don't want anything to do with you..", "NTA; The dad waited way too long to earn his Hero points in the eyes of the son.", "Nta. Too little too late. He let his step kids bully and mistreat you and that leaves scars. He didnt prioritize you then so doesnt get to be a m as martyr now.", "I think you're spot-on.\n\nThis man couldn't be bothered to stand up for his son, but expects his son to be grateful he stood up for his granddaughter?  \n\nOP's father's overdue actions are very suspect, and way too little, way too late.", "Yeah you\u2019re probably right I was just hoping up his dad was spineless and didn\u2019t see what was going on trying to hope for the best from others but the sad truth is sometimes people suck", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe man wants a medal for baseline decent behavior.", "Nta i Guess his wife dont Fuck him anymore", "NTA the timing of this seems suspicious. He was ok for his kid to be treated like an outcast but suddenly he's not okay with it extending to his grandkid? Seems like the relationship had run its course and he's hoping to gain you back by acting the martyr. I'm sorry your dad wasn't there for you.", "NTA\n\nLike you said, its basically a decade too late. He was fine with you being excluded and left behind cos obviously it wasn't a big deal and even though you spoke to him about it, you didn't cause a whole scene and just went with it.\n\nBut now the exclusion is blatantly obvious, it needs to be fixed, so he did, for the wrong person. The person he should have done it for is you. \n\nHe should be grateful that despite being excluded from the family HE chose, you still speak to him.", "NTA and you are right...he is too late. What an awful dad.", "\ud83c\udfc5 it's all I got but I think you're spot on", "I don't understand this question.

What is it you're supposed to be grateful for?\n\nNTA", "Hang on a minute, I missed something.  What were you meant to be grateful for?", "I wish this was higher. NTA on so many levels.", "NTA actions have consequences", "NTA parents protecting their kids like you are protecting your daughter is what your dad should have done. I'd consider keeping your dad away from your daughter because with his past odds are he'd do it to her to.", "NTA just stated a truth, too little too late", "So he can do the same to OPs daughter. A responsible parent wouldn't let him near his granddaughter."]}
