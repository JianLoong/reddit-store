If so, is this a break *from* your wife and are you re-thinking your relationship, and does your wife know this? And if your therapist doesn't know this, why did you leave it out? (Therapists are different, but I have a similar diagnosis and I most certainly would have have not been able to get away with something like this without some serious questions and strong encouragement to speak with my SO). Leaning Y T A", "YTA\n\nNot for needing a 2 week break, but for weaponizing your wife\u2019s ADD. You admitted you only told her once, & that when you did you were in a state of \u2018she\u2019s not listening fully right now and I don\u2019t care\u2019. 2 weeks is an extensive of enough time gone to have multiple conversations with your partner about your shared lives.", "I am changing my ruling to YTA based on this followup comment:\n\n\"When I was telling her I was kinda in like 'if she doesn't listen then fine', which I admit was wrong.\"\n\nIt is fine to want a break, using it as some sort of test for your wife makes you the AH.", "~~NTA. She needs to turn her listening ears on. Apparently, she did not learn that in Kindergarten.~~\n\nEDIT: changing to YTA because of this comment:\n\n>When I was telling her I was kinda in like 'if she doesn't listen then fine', which I admit was wrong.\n\nHer listening problem is not your responsibility, but you *knew* she would not remember after only one discussion (which was less than a minute long) due to her ADD diagnosis. I'm sure you intentionally avoided bringing it up again because you knew she would be upset about it. This behavior goes to show how little you seem to care about your wife and how much you probably resent her.", "So I see in the comments you told her one time, I guess INFO because I wonder what this conversation looked like? I can't imagine having ONE conversation with my partner about being away for two weeks. Did you tell her you wanted to go away for two weeks and that was that? Did you tell her after everything was booked so like \"I'm going away for two weeks to X location.\" If you were going to be gone for two weeks, are there any responsibilities you have at home that she would need to take care of? Cat, mow the lawn, pay the bills? If you needed her to pick up anything you usually do, then you failed to tell her that.\n\nSo you aren't an AH for not taking her on the break, at all. She should definitely listen to you and ask questions or have a discussion. But I can't help but think you are also an AH if the conversation was just \"my therapist says I should take a personal break, so I am going to go away for two weeks\" and then NOTHING else was said about it until you were packing? Because you don't lay out what you actually told your wife about this break, I'm not judging yet.", "Think you'll be having more than a two week break from her\n\nPersonally a short break for someone's mental health (where we had discussed costs dates etc in full) absolutely fine\n\nYou saying you want a break by yourself, then turning it into a two week vacation is different to me, so for that YTA (it may be both of you for the lack of communication if she knew the full dates)", "YTA.\n\nA \"trip\" would be a weekend type thing. You're using what in the US would be your entire year's vacation for yourself. Of course she's mad. How much is that \"break\" costing, that could be used for something for both of you?", "INFO how long was this conversation where you told her about it?", "INFO:  Any kids involved?  if yes, what are the ages?", "So, in this 40 second conversation, what did she say when you asked her if she\u2019d be OK with handling your normal responsibilities when you were gone? Did she say yes? Or did you just assume you could leave it all in her lap and walk out the door for two weeks?", "YTA. if my husband was packing for a 2 week vacation alone and we hadn't had a serious conversation, I would think he was abandoning me as a spouse, and I'd assume our marriage was being dissolved. Call it what it is buddy, and break from your wife. She's going to leave you for someone who takes her on trips, too. There is nothing more I want than to go on a 2 week break with my husband. If he said I wasn't invited our relationship would NEVER EVER be the same. You are now wifeless.", "YTA you only told her once and I think it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t want to actually discuss it with her. You should have 100% checked she knew and understood if it\u2019s something this important. Also 2 weeks is a really long time to go away without your wife. Do you share finances? How are you paying for this? When married you can\u2019t just go off for 2 weeks without any conversation at all about it. I have ADHD sometimes go in one ear and out the other due to it. My partner knows if it\u2019s someone important like this to make sure I\u2019m fully listening and understanding \n\nEdit: OP confirmed wife has ADD and he only spoke about it with her once for 40 seconds HUGE ASSHOLE thing to do", "I am adding a second YTA to OP for failing to mention that he had one 40 second conversation with his wife and he knew that was wasn't listening.  This was a material omission, YTA x 2.\n\n\"Around 40 seconds because I didn't really care if she did listen or not.\"\n\nI am leaning AH of the year on this one.  I hate it when people that leave things out like this.", "N T A\n\nThe part where even her parents didnt side with her stuck out to me.\n\nEDIT: After looking at additional info in the comments I\u2019m changing my vote to YTA. While I still stand with the vacation being justified and it\u2019s good you paid for it out of your own pocket, you absoltely blew it in terms of communication. When you\u2019re married, these don\u2019t become 40 second long conversations. It sounds like you deliberately made it brief so you wouldn\u2019t have to actively discuss it, to someone with ADD no less. Of course she would forget!", "INFO\n\nHow many times did you tell her?", "INFO for all those saying NTA:  OP admitted to telling his wife once via a \"40 second conversation\" because he did not care whether or not she knew.  This was passive aggressive pushback on a realtionship issue, not an honest attempt to communicate.  I think the OP is goingn to come back to huge marriage issues.", "YTA. It sounds like you were intentionally trying to hide this trip from your wife. Actually, based on your responses in the comments, it sounds like you do not even enjoy being around your wife.", "YTA - You know she is not a good listener.  I have ADD and a lot of times I do this (don't listen well) with my wife.  She knows this about me and not only repeat herself in conversation, but will talk to me about it multiple times leading up to said event.", "Tried to let her know, ONCE, per your comment when you know she isn\u2019t always listening\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nWould this be considered \"thick\" or \"thin\"?  I'm not really sure you are sticking to the idea of marriage.  \n\n\nYour WIFE has every right to be mad.", "YTA. For more than just the behavior of mentioning it once for under a minute and never again. Your edit shows that you don't have an interest in taking responsibility for your actions like an adult.

After reading your comments, your wife deserves more respect. Your mental health is not more important than hers. It's also not cool to TELL your wife you're leaving for 2 weeks. That's a long time and it requires a conversation and compromises on behalf of both parties.

I adjusted by telling him 3-4 times prior to event as well as clarifying day of before I get ready to make sure he remembers and isn't blind sided completely.... it's not that hard to be considerate of your partners even if it's a mild inconvience to yourself", "For real. My partner needs a mental health break. Not from me, but from work and stuff. Time to be him fully. And what\u2019s that? A long weekend, 3-4 days. 2 weeks is a lot. I\u2019d be upset, that\u2019s him using all his vacation time and we can\u2019t do anything together as a couple that\u2019s longer than leaving Friday and coming back Sunday. Maybe Monday if we get off the same holiday. I\u2019d be upset. \n\nI know OP need their space. But man. 2 weeks is a long time. My partner has discussed this multiple times. I know it will happen and I will have warning as to where. And my boundary was he contacts me once or twice per day to make sure he\u2019s safe and alive, since it\u2019s likely going to be remote camping. When you have a long term partner you can do what you want. But make them aware. And keep them informed.", "YTA. No discuss of what the therapist said, no discussion of timing or location, just stating that you're going on a solo vacation. You'll be lucky if she doesn't divorce you", "No, you actually *counted on* her having no recollection of this whatsoever.", "Gonna go against the group and say NTA. Really amazing how folks in the comments seem to know better than you what kind and duration of vacation would benefit your mental health! Had no idea there were so many doctors and mind readers on reddit.\n\nEven with the edits, bottom line is you did tell her. She could\u2019ve a) written it down, and b) not blown up when you reminded her and instead just acknowledged that she\u2019s forgetful. Thank you for not babying her because of her memory issues. You\u2019re an adult and you can travel as you please, and she shouldn\u2019t require daily updates on your plans; I feel like if the gender was reversed people would be calling your husband controlling. So sorry to hear you\u2019re changing your vacation plans to accomodate her irrational reaction.", "I need timeouts from everything, including my husband, but would usually one or two days.  The only exceptions are if he's doing something that wouldn't be my cup of tea - doing an outdoor event for a week where it's going to be really hot & dusty, or I want to go see my crazy, loud family for four of five days and I know he would have much more fun staying home, lol.\n\nTwo weeks seems excessive, I'm glad you talked and are finding an alternative.  A vacation together, away from stress with opportunities for each of you to have personal time should be amazing.", "As someone who is married to a complicated ptsd type, hugs.", "YTA.\nIf I were her. I'd be gone when you got back.", "YTA.  For only focusing on your own well-being and ignoring your spouse. If you are overwhelmed and exhausted\u2026..how can you not wrap your brain around her feeling exactly the same way!", "NTA.\n\nSometimes you really do need a break, and no, your partner going along will not help. This isn't a \"have a good time\" trip, this is \"decompress and put myself back together again\". Your updates are actually upsetting me and I'm pissed. Mental health is so big. \n\nI am seriously wondering if the people saying it's your fault have ever dealt with mental health for themselves, because I can't see anyone having serious issues thinking you're in the wrong. Sometimes being around people in general is the issue, and all you want to do is go stay in a hotel alone and not have to worry about dealing with anyone else's emotions since your own are already too much.\n\nI do not think this \"vacation\" is going to do any good. I could be wrong, since the specifics do matter, and I'm probably applying some of my own logic regarding my personal stuff, but... if your therapist didn't recommend the wife go...", "Lol I love this sub. Woman doesn't listen? Mans fault for not communicating better. Yeah she has ADD, but that's an explanation, not an excuse. She's 28, she should develop some skills to manage her ADD.", "Here\u2019s a thing\u2026. My husband was gone for 12 days. It was the longest I\u2019ve been absolutely alone, on my own, for 60 years.\nThe first 4 were really difficult. But I adjusted. It was truly good for both of us.\n\nI\u2019m not going to drag you. But you need to have much better communication skills in the future.\n\nYou both deserve it if this you want your marriage continue on an even keel.", "So in other words your wife who doesn\u2019t listen to you , who had a tantrum and left because you wanted to take vacation alone gets exactly what she wanted. Anyone hear that really loud whip sound. Lol, as long as your happy. All that said 2 weeks is a bit long of a break don\u2019t you think? 3 -4 days seems more reasonable.", "NTA. If he wants to do it alone for his mental health, than he can. He tried to tell her. She didn't listen. He is allowed to do those things.", "Doesn't op deserve more respect? Like his wife listening to him when he's talking to her?", "It\u2019s just so weird to have one 40-second conversation in which OP doesn\u2019t care if she\u2019s listening or not then never bring it up again until he\u2019s about to leave. Like he never discussed his itinerary or anything else she needed do extra around the house while he was gone?\n\nYes wife should work on her listening but in this instance it sounds like OP didn\u2019t even WANT her to listen.", "Not going to lie. I didn\u2019t even finish the post. I did read your comment though. \n\nI got to stay in bed until like 12:30 BOTH days last weekend. It was glorious. Until this post I couldn\u2019t tell anyone because I didn\u2019t want to brag.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t care\u201d  I hope your wife never finds this thread and learns how you talk about her.  YTA.", "Sure.  All you have to say is \"Honey, I'd like to take the next week off to do some thinking.  Is that okay with you?\"\n\nThen you put it on the calendar.  Then, if you know your partner has ADHD,  you bring it up every day.   You do not take 40 seconds to say it and announce that you didn't care if they heard it anyway.\n\nFrankly, if my beloved spouse said he needed two weeks away, I'd expect him to add \"And if you want to do the same thing after I'm back, go on a trip with friends or whatever, that goes without saying.\"", "NAH I would want to go on vacation with my partner. If he wanted 2 weeks alone we would have a huge problem. Not everyone is the same.", "I know it's too Late. But... NTA... as a person who suffers from Mental health issues, I understand  sometimes you need to process and be ALONE with your thoughts. At least I do. I too, married someone who had trouble listening (ADHD which I ALSO have in addition to other issues) and I understand why you got upset at her for not \"hearing\" your needs. I guess that makes us both the asshole. But anywho... I'm glad you patched it up with her and hopefully can use the trip as a unifying experience.", "To be fair.... I have about 136 hours of vacation time a year.... so two weeks is nothing to me", "Back in my day we used calendars for that sort of thing! Real calendars, the paper kind you hung on a wall that had boxes for each day that you could write in!\n\n(And we walked to work. In the snow. Uphill all the way!)", "AND she has ADHD and he said it when he knew she wasn\u2019t totally clued in \u2014 shit memory is literally a symptom of adhd it can\u2019t just be beaten through sheer willpower. and he mentioned it when he knew her brain wasn\u2019t all there so she couldn\u2019t even make reminders, etc", "Wow\u2026.!!!!!  I now understand the \u201cdick in hand\u201d reference. Damn mate!  Not a foot but a dick.", "Dont worry about it. If she decides to have her alone time at her parents leave her alone to sort herself out (it sounds childish to me) and you too can have a partial extension to your alone time. Who knows, perhaps you will decide you would rather live alone. You never know...", "> You're using what in the US would be your entire year's vacation for yourself\n\nHow sad is that!", "This 100% my husband and I both have ADHD, diagnosed but untreated, we have a physical calendar with everything written on it AND share our Samsung calendars and I STILL do what you described here.", "I have ADHD. Yes I have a personal responsibility--just like anyone--to listen to and understand the people around me to the best of my ability. However, my best attempt to pay attention is never going to equal the best attempt to pay attention by a neurotypical person--that's why it's a disability. I require a bit of grace from my partner when I miss things, because I'm trying my best but my best frequently isn't good enough. I could definitely be the confused and hurt wife shocked to find my husband is going away for two weeks and I didn't know. And honestly it's easier to miss things said by my partner than by my employer. While at work I'm switched on at all times so I don't miss anything (which is absolutely exhausting and I crash hard afterwards), but I can't maintain that level of focus 24/7 so at home it comes and goes."]}
