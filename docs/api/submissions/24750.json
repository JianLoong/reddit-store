My mom didn\u2019t get a DUI until I went off to college (because as teens we were supposed to stop her from driving drunk). I had to do grocery shopping at your age when she was in rehab for a month and a half. And I had to pick her up from work when she showed up drunk. I\u2019m still unraveling the effects of the parentification that I experienced as a result of her drinking and I am almost 50 and have a family of my own. I\u2019m sorry as it sounds like you are going through something similar. Chicken is a reasonable substitute for turkey. Drinking can affect their memory and that might be why she forgot the lemons (and then blamed you for not thinking about the fact that you were having company, as parents we are supposed to teach our children life tasks, not just expect them to know them).", "NTA\n\nGood for you setting boundaries and standing up to your mom.   Keep on doing it.   Don't take her abuse.", "You are set up for failure if all you get is a shopping list w/o real insight of what is going on. Your mom should go over the list with you and actually teach you how to shop for a household. Like telling you that there is a party, and that you are going to make lemonade. And she should try to accommodate your mistakes - use the ground chicken, and see how it turns out.\n\nThat said, I can also see why your mom is in a bad mood. Depending on somebody who is going to mess up and who doesn\u2018t know exactly how to fill in for her can be extremely frustrating. Demanding a list taking into account any possible alternative is pushing it a bit far on your behalf. Some people would look at that as weaponized incompetence.\n\nThe both of you should cut each other some slack and work together to make things run a bit more smoothly", "Was this a stupid mistake or does she have a drinking problem?\n\nShe sounds like a woman who is a little beaten up by the world and taking it out on you.\n\nTell her you will only go shopping with a list and you will only buy what's on that list.

I told him it would take her less than a minute to read the list and initial it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s equally driving you crazy trying to shop for someone who always finds fault with you when you do it. Also, the inconvenience of being off the road for drunk driving is the point. If there were no consequence she\u2019d keep doing it. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty simple. Either she is specific about what she wants or she can catch a bus to the supermarket.\n\nMaybe she actually enjoys being right by forcing a situation where she can always claim you were wrong. Is this sort of thing typical for her?", "NTA - your mother us a massive AH who deserves to have her life difficult for getting a DUI !  \nOnly selfish trash do that", "You are NTA.

It also has saved me more money in the long run because I\u2019m not impulse shopping.

Good luck to you, and remember it's not your fault and that they're the grownups, not you. You should be able and allowed to enjoy your childhood and youth. Experiences and chores you have at your age should be for learning, not because your parents can't handle their own responsibility. \n\nOf course I'm aware that that's not the reality for many people (including myself).

Why else does she refuse to sign the shopping lists?\n\nMom needs something to yell at her kid over.  The kid is smart enough to take away the ammo.", "Yeah, the fee seems reasonable for a whole carload of groceries, but buying one thing via a delivery service usually makes the price vastly inflated.", "I only use it now when hubby is going to be away and I have the kids because it is alot less hassle then dealing with the kids on my own, plus we only have one car. I will walk to the shops when he is away with the kids and I am home alone but if I have the kids, it is deliveries all the way, now that the delivery fees aren't as high as they were pre covid.", "I'm only a little bit into trains, but if I see the inside of a grocery store again, it'll be too soon.\n\nAdd a couple toddlers to the mix and it's just hell.\n\nEdit: [explanation of the into trains joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/trains/comments/wzrh1j/is_it_ok_to_like_trains/)", "As a former Instacart driver-- don't use them.\n\nThey recently lowered their minimum payment (again) from $10, to $7, to $4. \n\nThat means the shopper will be hunting around a grocery store, hauling heavy groceries, driving around and trying to coordinate a delivery, all for $4, maybe a $5 tip on top. All of this takes an hour to two hours, depending on delivery distance. We don't get any reimbursement for gas or vehicle maintenance.\n\nTheir fees are already exorbitant, and customers assume we get some of that $20 price gouging fee, so they're less likely to tip well. We don't get that money. \n\nThere were plans for a boycott, but it fizzled out into nothing, as expected. Just try to avoid it.\n\nI'm disabled, and Instacart had me working for $5/hr after gas with herniated disk, but I needed the money desperately. This is not how people should live.", "NTA. Your mom may be an alcoholic and she arguable can\u2019t necessarily help that, but she always had the option to prevent the DUI by not driving when she knows she\u2019s drinking. Zero sympathy is deserved for her situation of not being able to drive, because, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s like where I live and you don\u2019t get your license immediately revoked the first time. But even if it is one-and-done where you are, still zero sympathy for drunks not being allowed to drive. It\u2019s for the better for everyone.\n\nOk too of that, if she\u2019s going to be a cow about everything, you\u2019re in the right for having her sign off on a lists.\n\nAnd you\u2019re 16, it is ***regular parenting*** to teach you appropriate substitutions for meals so that you can be equipped to do efficient grocery shopping on your own when you\u2019re an adult.\n\nLastly, you are doing her and your family a massive  service by picking up the slack by grocery shopping for her when her only issue is self pity for the consequences of her own terrible actions. Driving while intoxicated is reprehensible. She should be nothing but grateful for you doing the shopping. Plus grocery shopping sucks, I\u2019d be super happy to have someone to pawn it off on.\n\nNTA. You are 100% in the right by refusing to go without a signed list. I would also think you would still be in the right for telling your mom to get bent, it\u2019s her legal responsibility to feed you until you\u2019re an adult and she can take the bus for all you care. Not like that would go over well, but you\u2019d still be in the right. There\u2019s a reason that grocery stores always have bus stops out front.", "NTA. I like your solution. it makes perfect sense to me.", "NTA, wow she sounds utterly insane and controlling, yet has no actual control over her life lol. What does she even do (besides drink and drive) that causes her not to have time to go to the store with you anymore? \n\nAlso this part was so funny \u201cdad says it\u2019s driving her crazy not being able to drive and I should cut her some slack\u201d like if only if there was something she could have done differently, but we\u2019ll never now what that is.", "NTA.  \u201cMom, if you\u2019re going to complain and put me down no matter how perfectly I follow your list, then there\u2019s no point to me even trying.  So I\u2019m not going to anymore.  From now on, you\u2019re either going to have to a) live with whatever *I* decide to buy, or b) figure out another way to get groceries.  And you have no one to blame but yourself.\u201d", "Why can\u2019t your dad do it then? NTA she\u2019s being unkind out of resentment. But the circumstances are on her.", "Your mother is emotionally abusive to you and your Dad wants you to shut up and take it, so he doesn't have to listen to her. That really sucks for you and it is unfair. NTA", "NTA- tell her to have the groceries delivered. It shouldn't be your responsibility to drive your mother around because she CHOSE to drink and drive. If it's driving her crazy than she should look in the mirror instead of taking it out on her minor child.", "I think you've shown a good amount of common sense here - it shouldn't take much extra time. NTA", "NTA. You can remind her ground chicken is waaayyy better than jail food.  Shame on her, you aren\u2019t the parent, she needs to learn gratitude and acceptance of her consequences.  I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s taking her anger and frustrations out on you, you don\u2019t deserve this.", "your mom sounds like an alcoholic. NTA op, i hope she can get the counseling she needs", "[removed]", "Tell ypur Dad the consequences of her substance addiction are her problem and her fault. Explain you are done with her abuse. This list was to protect you, no list, no persobal shopper. She can uber to the store.", "NTA\n\nAlthough you could have her write the list instead, if that might be better? Either way, it's clearly necessary to have a written list if she's going to be a problem about it, and it's usually better for most people while shopping anyway. Having substitutions for every ingredient may be unreasonable though, espeically when she's not there with you (I certainly don't remember everything in my local store XD), perhaps just substitutions for ingredients she absolutely needs and anything else if they're out you just won't buy?\n\nBut it's absolutely reasonable to not want to be berrated about things that aren't your fault! So find a way that works for that, even if it means driving her to the store every time lol. And to be fair, you ARE cutting her slack. You've been trying, she's made it clear your attempts are unwelcome, so now you're taking her instead. You haven't, say, bought out every donut in the place and brought them and nothing else home and said \"they were out of everything, so I brough these as substitutes\" or any other instance of acting out. If she can't tell you what she wants, then clearly she wants to do it herself.", "NTA, things your mom should\u2019ve thought of before getting a DUI. I\u2019d just take her and make her get what she wants", "Nope. Don't give in. I think that's a great idea. Why isn't Dad driving her grocery shopping? \n\nBtw, if the store is out of something, FaceTime Mom and ask what she wants as a substitute. Hopefully if she knows she's on speaker, she won't be such a dip with the language.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Your mom is one to talk...seriously. \n\nYou know what is unacceptable? A DUI. Uber, Lyft, etc and she couldn't think of that option before she decided to drive?\n\nIf your mom is going to bully you for making choices, she can do it your way. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I would have her initial just once rather than per item, but that's a reasonable reaction to getting flak for getting the \"wrong\" items.", "NTA, kiddo. It sounds like she is trying to make a 16 yo responsible for more than is fair. Be sure to implement careful emotional boundaries as soon as you turn 18 or as soon as you move out.", "NTA and just wanted to say sorry you're put in such a shitty situation at 16, having to be the responsible one. Luckily you have found your strength and stood your ground, wish you the best", "This is good training for when you have a micromanager later in life. Keep making her accountable.", "NTA.  She sends you to the store & then has the gall to complain that you didn't get the right stuff.  I think writing a list & initialliing it is a great idea.  She needs to be held accountable & stop blaming you.", "NTA. Your mother has several years of experience in grocery shopping, so if she does it herself, she probably has no problem if an item is out to decide for a substitute. You, on the other hand, don't have that experience. So, if you bring a substitute that she doesn't like, she shouldn't call you 'an idiot' but just explain, why it's not good and what would be a better substitute.\n\nIn general, she is responsible for the grocery shopping, so that the right things in the right amount will be bought to make the dishes she has planned to do. So, if she can't to the shopping herself, she needs to make sure, the person who does it (you) has all the information needed to do it the way she wants. So, she needs to give you a list like you suggested. Or, if you write the list, she needs to check it.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s not entitled to take the consequences of her poor decisions out on you. \n\nDrunk drivers kill people, the fact that she didn\u2019t kill anyone is she\u2019d dumb luck. Why would anyone do her a favor?", "Nta your mom sounds like a piece of work hopefully you get out of there sooner then later", "Tell her she\u2019s made her own bed by driving like an absolute bellend! She deserves to be frustrated after getting a dui, tbh she deserves a lot more than that! \ud83d\ude21\nWell done for sticking to your guns, NTA!", "NTA\n\nNot your fault your mother chose to risk other people's lives and drive while under the influence.  MAJOR AH move there and deserving of losing one's license.\n\nStand your ground and make he be responsible in at least one aspect of her life while ensuring she is not blaming you for her own mistakes.", "NTA. Your mom is an alcoholic and she'd acting like one. Sorry you're having to go through this but you are doing the right thing.", "She doesn't like your conditions, she's free to ask someone else.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019d miss her daily dose of assholery if she couldn\u2019t blame you for anything she deems stupid By giving you a list and potentially taking full responsibility there would be no entertainment left for her twisted mind.\n\nThere are only a very few types of people I despise more that those who DUI. The least she could do is show some humility and be grateful to you, not play stupid mind games.", "Sweeting, find yourself an Al-Anon group. You can find them in person or on Zoom.\n\nYour mom is being terrible to you. This situation is a direct result of her drinking, and she\u2019s making you suffer for it.\n\nNTA, and you\u2019re doing great at setting strong boundaries.
