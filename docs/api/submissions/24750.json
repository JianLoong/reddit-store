Your mom though. The DUI is enough for me. But she sounds like a control freak and I think, but I'm not sure, that this is actually gaslighting. She yells you what to buy and then gets upset if you don't buy things that aren't on the list. Keep writing stuff down.", "NTA - Your mom got a DUI and isn't helping with the grocery list. Given that you're getting chewed out unreasonably, I think it's fine to be stubborn in response. Initialing a list takes 0.2 seconds.\n\nYou're getting chewed out for nothing. Your mom sounds like she has a lot to work on, starting with communication.", "NTA. I feel like there is a better solution here. ask her for a list and if it's not there just text her. you also need to assert yourself and not let her speak down to you when you're just trying to do what was asked. Make her realise your value to the family and that you need to be respected", "Can she use instacart or peapod so they are delivered? Or is there a store near you that allows you to buy online and then they just bring it out to your car? I honestly still use this service even after Covid because sometimes the last thing I want to do after a long day is walk around a grocery store", "NTA. Well she did the drinking and driving so this is her consequence. She needs to cope with it without taking her feelings out on you. Your rule on this shopping makes a lot of sense.", "NTA \n\nIf before she had the DUI, she was driving to the store, it didn't take her any longer than it takes you to drive her.  If it's not always at a convenient time, that's part of the price of getting a DUI.  You're the one being most inconvenienced.  The least she could do is read and initial the list.", "NTA my husband will ask me if he can switch items to substitute if they don't have a certain item. Doesn't bother me or if I make a list I put down substitutes as well and if I don't he can call me and ask. \nI think what you are doing is completely acceptable and reasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
