My boyfriend and I planned a trip a month in advance with our two friends to go to a concert. A week before we were supposed to go, my boyfriend\u2019s grandmother passed, and we were told that the funeral was the day before the show. The day of the funeral, we get a text that they were going to the concert right then, and they asked if we were ready. We all planned on going Sunday- the day of the concert- and getting the Airbnb, but they mistakenly thought the concert was Saturday and rented the airbnb for Saturday. We told them we were at the funeral and we don\u2019t know about going yet. While at the funeral and burial our friend steadily sent texts asking for updates, but I did not reply because we were in the middle of service. Right after, we went to the burial. During that time of me not answering, she decided that they were gonna get another Airbnb for Sunday. When I was finally able to text, I told her that we would like to go, but the day has been emotionally exhausting for the both of us and that we aren\u2019t sure.\n\nFast forward to the day of the concert- She texts and asks if we were going to the concert. By the way, we bought our tickets, so they didn\u2019t have to pay for anything of ours on the trip if we went, and we told her that we weren\u2019t going to be able to and that yesterday was a lot on us. After sending her the text, she immediately asked if we had sent her the money for the Airbnb. I was a bit confused on why she asked, since we said we weren\u2019t going. I told her that I didn\u2019t pay and that we would but we don\u2019t see the point since we didn\u2019t go. She got upset and blamed us on them getting such an expensive Airbnb saying that we didn\u2019t update them and that they could of gotten a smaller place. They rented an airbnb for one night for $300. Her and her husband got mad and told us to pay the $150. I\u2019m not the confrontational type so I just paid and left it be.\n\nI just wanted to see what you guys think of it all. I do understand that I could have texted and updated her throughout the funeral, but I didn\u2019t want to be disrespectful while there. I just thought it was a little insensitive asking for money the day after the funeral.  AITA?\n\nEdit** I\u2019m not mad about this at all. I just thought the whole thing was insensitive and I just wanted an opinion. I never put up a fight about the money. I just sent it and went on.

The decision to pick the place they did was based on you all attending and sharing the costs, rather than choosing somewhere cheaper to suit themselves only. The fact that they even confirmed with you the day before and you agreed definitely puts the onus on you to pay your share.", "ESH.\n\nYour friends are absolute lunatics for incessantly texting you during your BFs grandmother's funeral and also dicks for insisting that you pay for the Airbnb.\n\nAt the same time, OPs automatic opinion that they aren't on the hook for their portion of a lodging accommodation that they bailed on at the last minute to attend the funeral of a person they probably never actually met does reek of odd privilege.", "Info - did you tell your friends that you wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the concert and *then* they scheduled an Airbnb?

They had to have known you could not respond for the duration of that event.  That is really insensitive.\n\nYou did tell them you were unsure as to whether or not you\u2019d be going to the concert, so their booking lodging to include you was inappropriate as you were not available to confirm.  They should have either waited until the evening to contact you again, or they should have booked for themselves alone and texted you that they were leaving your lodging up to you since your plans were fluid.\n\nI understand why you and your BF are hurt.  It was generous of you to give them the money, but Miss Manners would have told you that you were under no obligation to do so.

You agreed to pay half of one night in a rental for a concert.  Your friends were counting on you paying your half of one night in an rental.    It sounds like they asked you for one half of one night in the rental-- even though they stayed for two.   You are the one that backed out on the trip so it is fair for you to pay your share of the group plans and you fairly paid your share for one night of the rental.  \n\nYou were wishy-washy about Sunday until the very last minute.  Your friends were kind enough to think to get a bigger rental than they really needed for an additional night so that it would be easy for you to attend.  That is what friends do.", "ESH I\u2019m not sure how the Saturday booking is relevant as it looks like they asked you to cover half of Sunday, which was the original plan. Bombarding someone with texts during a funeral is wild on their part so they suck for that. But the day before the concert, you indicated that you\u2019d still like to go but you weren\u2019t sure. You left your plans up in the air so it makes sense that they moved forward with accommodations to fit everyone. Sending a formal cancellation the day of when they asked for confirmation before booking was where you went wrong.", "ESH. You were not clear with your plans. You had agreed to Sunday and the concert. They booked for Sunday and included you, as you had not said you would not come. \nSaturday was not planned or agreed upon, so they should not assume you will pay half of that cost. \nThe day of the funeral was not an appropriate time to suddenly demand confirmation of arrangements. Of course you were not free to make any decisions then. \nThis situation would not have happened with better communication on all sides.", "YTA\n\nThere's a difference between canceling plans in advanced and dropping them at the last second.\n\nIn unique situations like this I firmly believe you made the choice to not go, that doesn't mean you're entitled to mess up the trip for the people you agreed to go with.\n\nIn the future you may want to avoid these kinds of arrangements.

They could have just said \u201chey, we are getting a smaller Airbnb for tonight since you all aren\u2019t sure yet.\u201d But they decided not to wait on you to make the final decision. You were at a time of mourning and what they did wasn\u2019t right, IMO. You still paid, which is something I didn\u2019t think you HAD to do. Them texting you during a funeral bugging you about it all was kinda really insensitive and rude of them. \n So, NTA.", "I\u2019m very confused here, but it sounds like you long ago agreed to a plan was to go to a concert on Sunday and stay in and Airbnb Sunday night.  For whatever reason you did not go and you did not cancel prior to your friends booking the AirBnB.  So you owe your friends your share of the AirBnB they reserved for Sunday night.  \n\nThe funeral was Saturday so I don\u2019t see how that is relevant.  Also your friends mistakenly made an AirBnB reservation for Saturday and I don\u2019t think that is relevant either.\n\nIn any case, YTA.  You are indeed responsible for half the Sunday night Airbnb.", "Why after the death did you even consider a concert the day after a funeral? You had to know his relationship with his grandmother and how heavy it would be for him. You kept them hanging because you still wanted to go but he couldn\u2019t because he was emotionally drained. You should at least give them $75", "ESH. Quite muddled. One thing though, doesn\u2019t matter if grandma passed you need to be more responsible. A text here or there isn\u2019t hard and funeral doesn\u2019t hold you not responsible for things. Also it\u2019s HIS grandma not your mum, so that changes things a bit too. You could of communicated more. But if you found out they didn\u2019t book Sunday and then did not commit to them then it\u2019s ultimately their responsibility I guess. But, you guys had a good time planned and they had to make arrangements and were under time constraint so maybe you should pay because you just left it hanging in the air. Sounds a bit entitled from you, oh a funeral, so I just screw my friends weekend over leaving them just guessing. Not being able to send at least a text here and there is a joke.", "It was insensitive for them to blow up your phone and not have any patience while you were at a funeral.  I don\u2019t think you owed them any money.  They made the decision on their own without your agreement up front.  It might be worth the loss if you want to keep the friendship but if it is gonna always bother you perhaps it is a cheap price to pay to be out of the friendship.", "NTA. They should not have booked without a firm agreement from you on the details. No, you could not text during the middle of a funeral! That would have been disrespectful to everyone around you. \n\nI would not be happy about this either, but I would consider whether this particular friendship was worth $150 to me.", "NTA and bad friends. If I was them I\u2019m refusing to take your money, eating the bigger place and expense and chalking it up what goes around comes around.", "NTA.  You said you were not sure and so they should have texted back, \"we will just book for ourselves then\" and left it at that.  You could have texted her a similar one, but it is unclear if she would have gotten it in time, \"please do not count on us for the air bnb since we aren't sure if we are going.\"  I really can't imagine pestering someone during a funeral.  Your friends seem a bit self-focused.", "YTA. With only a day's notice, your friend needed to know whether to book accommodations for two or four people. Unless you were willing to pay your share under any circumstance (which it doesn't sound like you were, otherwise we wouldn't be here), \"I don't know\" isn't a good answer to someone who is trying to make reservations for you. It wasn't great of your friend to keep messaging you during the funeral, but that could have been avoided with a definitive answer from you.\n\nNow, I understand that you very likely weren't in the best headspace given the circumstances, but you had options. If you were really on the fence about going, a better choice would have been to tell her before the funeral that you would make a decision later AND that you would find your own lodging if you did choose to go, which would have allowed her to make a smaller, less expensive booking for herself and her husband. Instead, you left your friend hanging. Your indecision left your friend with a difficult decision to make, and she chose the option that still gave you the option to attend. How would you have felt if you had decided to go, only to find that your friend made a new booking that excluded you?\n\nHad the Airbnb originally been booked on the correct date, you still would have paid your half, right? This really isn't that different. Ultimately, she was inconsiderate, but so were you.", "NTA and I wouldn't have paid and I'd have told them that they are insensitive AHs. Harrasing you while you're putting a loved one to rest. I'd move on from these people.", "What they did was book the room to get that off your shoulders as you were busy at the funeral, which was a thoughtful act. However, as you stated, you were not sure you would even go, so out of courtesy and under the circumstances, they should not have asked for money.", "ESH\n\nBlowing up someone\u2019s phone while they\u2019re at a funeral is wild as hell.  Since they made an executive decision to book to accommodate people they weren\u2019t sure would be attending, that\u2019s their responsibility.  They either eat the additional cost if you don\u2019t go or get a space appropriate for them and y\u2019all tough it out for a single night on a couch or whatever.  There also must have been 30 seconds in the entire day, even while you used the restroom or drove from one location to the next, to quickly text you were unsure if you were going and for them to make accommodations for themselves and you\u2019ll figure out lodging on your own if you need it.", "ESH, they shouldn\u2019t be badgering you about this while you\u2019re at a funeral. Based on how you describe it, you made these plans to meet up Sunday and so the Airbnb would be for Sunday. They picked the wrong day, that\u2019s on them, but I do think giving them some amount of money for the place makes sense because that was the original plan. I do think you should\u2019ve been more communicative and not strung them along. You should\u2019ve decided right then and there you couldn\u2019t go and been done with it.", "ESH\n\nthey\u2019re the AH for texting you repeatedly during a funeral and not giving grace in replies. Also AH for booking wrong day - did they make you cover for Saturday too? \n\nYTA because although you never explicitly agreed, you also never explicitly said no. And as a planner myself, I worry about booking things before things are gone/ too late and also to ensure everyone has comfortable arrangements. Your friends should have got a clear confirmation from you before booking but they prob were under the assumption that since you had your tickets and you expressed that you would like to go but are unsure that it leaned more towards going.\n\nIn the future, if it involves bookings / money, both parties need to communicate clearly. Being unsure is not an answer.", "NAH\n\nHmmm, I can see it from their perspective since they\u2019re only asking for the Sunday Airbnb.\n\nThey contacted you numerous times to ask if you were going to stay Sunday night, but got no reply. \n\nSo they had to decide whether to assume you\u2019d join them and get a bigger place or just get a much cheaper one for the 2 of them. They made the wrong choice, but you\u2019re inability to communicate did force them to make that choice.\n\nI think paying you 1/2 the cost might have been a reasonable compromise.", "Nta, except for to yourself. You paid 150 to learn a lesson, so learn it and don't talk to them again. They didn't give a shit about your grief, only their pleasure.", "Well, there's room for improvement by both you and your friends:\n\n* Considerate people do not hound someone about entertainment plans while that person is AT A FUNERAL. Just. Don't. (This is the worst thing that your friends did.)\n* I gather that their mistake booking for Saturday night is something that they did not expect or ask you to pay for.\n* While you didn't see their texts during the funeral, you did see their texts BEFORE they had booked anything and answered that you didn't know whether you would be coming or not. This is where all three of you could have done better.\n\n1. Friends (once the confusion was cleared up and you let them know you were uncertain about plans for Sunday) should have texted you ONCE to let you know that (1) they were sorry for bf's loss and understood you two were with family and (2) if you were able to let them know whether you were coming or not, that would help. If they didn't hear from you by X time, they would book a place that accommodated both couples.\n2. They should have minimized the expense since they did not know if you were coming.\n3. When you saw their texts and knew they wanted an answer (but still didn't know if you would attend), you should have encouraged them to find a place that was good for just them but ALSO offer to pay for some of the costs. (1) It's understandable that your minds were not on the concert, but then you should have just released them from worrying about whether you were coming or not. (2) You should have offered to share some of the costs because the plans had been for the four of you to share the cost of Sunday night. While the funeral taking over your plans is completely understandable, it is not the fault of your friends. You should have offered to offset any excess cost above what they would have spent had you attended.\n4. They could have also offered to just pay for the AirBnB. It would have been more likely if you had let them know to not worry about you. They could have booked a smaller place and only paid a little more then their half of a shared rental with you. Because you just kept saying 'you don't know,' you left them feeling a bit obligated to include you in the accommodations.\n\nI think in the end, I'm going with ESH. Them for their complete lack of compassion during your funeral (that is, if your description of them hounding you with texts is accurate). You for keeping them on a string (that is NOT a cancellation) and not recognizing that the cost of you two going to the funeral shouldn't fall on their shoulders.", "YTA.  \nYou planned on going... you're part of the reservation.   You are responsible for your share.  It is not your friends' fault or responsibility that you bailed out of a RESERVATION.\n\nYes, YTA and you already knew that.", "INFO: did they purchase the Saturday tickets before gma passed?", "Understandably alot is going on when a loved one dies, but when exactly did OP know what day the funeral would be and why not tell the friends then that there was a funeral they would be attending.  From the post it sounds like the friends didn't know they were at a funeral when they first texted to see if OP was ready to go.", "Yta for paying for something you had no business paying for.", "NAH - They needed to make a decision.\n\nYou could have refused to pay, but it isn't worth the cost of the friendship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then they\u2019d be the bad guy bc they cancelled and left their friends hanging when they already had concert tickets.

It sounds to me you owe half of whatever night you originally agreed upon.  \n\nGiving to cover one night saved your friendship.  She lacked complete compassion for texting you so much during the service.  Sounds like she panicked a bit when she had the wrong night.\n\nNTA but I am not sure the friend is either.", "I think regardless you do owe her for one day. They agreed to the concert expecting to split a room. The details are probably irrelevant and if this is a close friend, not worth fighting over.", "Yes you're right. However I think OP should have cancelled when the grandmother died, or cancelled when the friend asked if they're going. OP just said \"idk yet\" and I can see how frustrating that would be if you're trying to make plans.", "OP did commit to it. She never gave her friend a definite answer so her friend proceeded with the original plan.", "They were at a *funeral*. \n\nWhat kind of jerk continually texts someone who just told them they were at a *funeral* and didn't know if they'd still be going to the concert, and then doesn't give them time to answer back? Holy cow. \n\nIf they could not wait a bit longer to book an AirBNB (understandable) then just text that you've booked your own and if grieving friends decide to go they'll have to make their own accommodations. \n\nBut I cannot imagine not showing *some* grace to someone who has just lost a family member or showing them some grace when the funeral disrupts previous plans. Like. If ever there was a forgivable cancellation, this is it.", "Dude. They were at a fucking funeral. It could have waited or they could get a hotel if they needed one. They did not ask these people to arrange housing for them.  Same day rentals are also a thing, of they wanted one.", "ummm. fucking FUNERAL??!!  good god dear person\u2014 you are the new AH!!!", "Sure you can but then the proper response is your friend doesn\u2019t include you because you didn\u2019t respond.

What they should have done was book an Airbnb for just the two of them and if OP could go they could figure out their own lodging (price of being indecisive).", "I disagree. If I\u2019m the friend of OP and I get a wishy washy answer; I\u2019m just gonna book for myself and my boyfriend. Not my problem if they can\u2019t commit.\n\nInstead they took the risk assuming they were coming. \n\nAt the end of the day the friend didn\u2019t book the airbnb correctly which caused this whole thing and was trying to make plans while OP was AT A FUNERAL.", "So what were they supposed to do, she asks if they need to include them in the new Airbnb and she says, I really want to go. What are they supposed to do? That means I want you to include me. She can\u2019t have her cake and eat it to, this is a zero sum game. OP chose to keep the option open, OP has to pay for that, particularly when it sounds like OP isn\u2019t being asked to pay for the original night that they all agreed to. \n\nSo the friends in this case let them off the hook for Saturday bc of the funeral, not bc they messed up bc OP admits in other comments they messed up the date and agreed to the Saturday airbnb too, but the friends DIDNT charge for that. They then ask about the second one, a whole new deal, and OP wants to keep their options open, well then OP needs to pay for it. So the friends get a larger second airbnb after taking on the cost of the first one and OP bails on that too. That\u2019s unreasonable to expect them to eat both costs even though the funeral is the reason for the cancellation. They only got the larger second airbnb bc op wanted to be able to come if they decided they were able to, there\u2019s absolutely no reason the friends should pay for that.", "I agree, the friends should have been more considerate about the situation. Both parties could have handled this better.", "This. Geez.", "I wouldn\u2019t have booked the larger AirBnb either but that doesn\u2019t absolve OP of her poor communication.

She should have just told them not to worry about her and her bf.", "I'd be inclined to say NAH - that everyone did their best in a complicated situation. Friends just wanted to help get everyone a fun place to stay together at the last minute \u2013 and planning was obviously confusing for all, especially with the unplanned funeral. The question of whether or not OP had implicitly committed to the rental to some degree is debatable. Everyone lost some money. Shit happens. \n\nBut friends seemed to show a real lack of empathy for a death in the family, placing their entertainment needs ahead of OP's family/emotional needs.

Because I wouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019d have said, hey, we went ahead and booked our own place, no worries, expecting that if OP changed her mind she\u2019d make her own arrangements. This was a bad call on the friends\u2019 part and I wouldn\u2019t have paid her or possibly paid half of that amount as a good grace effort. OP paid her anyway and they are STILL pissed off at her.
