My (19m) son moved out over a year ago but was back within 6 months and living in our lounge room on a mattress as we didn\u2019t have the spare bedroom. We had to move soon anyways as our lease was ending, so we discussed it with my son on what his plans were, as the current rental situation is hard to get into he decided to stick it out at home (he was working full time bringing in about 1 grand per week). We moved into a new bigger house giving everyone their own space. We discussed with him to pay his way, 180 for rent 40 for all bills and 100 towards food this he agreed too. Shortly after moving into the new house my son was made redundant and received a payout (which he spent most of it on Uber eats) since then he hasn\u2019t paid for anything, is currently about 13 weeks behind on rent, he refuses to look for work refuses to help out around the house doesn\u2019t clean up after himself and sleeps all day and up all night playing on his Xbox.\nRecently the company my husband worked for was liquidated and we were left with nothing to pay the bills or get food, the last few weeks have been really hard trying to feed everyone and keep the bills paid we still haven\u2019t gotten a full payment and are now behind on everything. Since this has happened we have had to limit food to make it last which my son has been eating nonstop at night (enough for 2-3 people per meal) and just doesn\u2019t seem to care when I bring it up with him. It has gotten to the point where I don\u2019t eat so that the kids can. \nHe just got his tax done and straight away he has ordered Uber eats again while the rest of us struggle. he just doesn\u2019t care and expects us to pay and cover him financially which we can\u2019t afford to do.\nWIBTAH for kicking him out\n\nTo answer a few questions, my 13yo and 5yo are both autistic the 5yo has been non-verbal up until last year, they both have therapy sessions weekly, which take up most of my time during the day. My 5yo will be starting school next year so I am studying at night to increase my chances at a better job to contribute more. We were able to run the household on my husbands wage before the liquidation happened but since then he has had to take what he could and his hours have been cut due to this. \nWe did have savings but it was used up during the move it cost us 8 grand to move and we hadn\u2019t had the chance to replenish it yet. Where I live I only get child support up to 18 years from his father and what I did get was not enough as he didn\u2019t work. \nWe both sat my son down and spoke to him about everything as he is an adult we started with him sorting out his own food, he has his own pantry, fridge and even part of the freezer to store food, but he would just order food instead causing weight gain. So we discussed him paying to help with the food bill since it worked out to be a lot cheaper on him, since losing his job we haven\u2019t charged him for food/rent just asked that he be more considerate of everyone else I have also asked that he helps out more around the house instead of paying his share but he refuses to help out. We have also discussed his mental health issues, and I have helped as much as I can, by helping to clean his room and wash all his clothes (took 3 days there was so much) I even started waking him up in the mornings as he was struggling to get up.", "created_utc": 1692960042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160vl9g/wibtah_for_kicking_my_son_out_after_he_refuses_to/", "score": 5342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After a few months of this my dad sat me down and told me and told me that between paying for a wasted year of college and letting me move back in rent free they had done enough for me and it was time for me to grow the fuck up and start being a man.

He's 19 and needs to get a job", "Kick your asshole son out.", "NTA for wanting him to help out and to pay what he agreed to, especially in a situation like the one you're in, but ESH a bit in this situation. \n\nI know things are different in different countries, but it's still a bit of a cultural shock when I read about parents asking for their children to pay rent when they're barely out of school. Here, if you go to college for instance, careers are really long, so assuming you study in your own city (which is pretty normal), people usually live with their parents until their mid 20's. And even if you're not studying, kids move out when they're ready to do it, it's not assumed you have to start paying rent only because you're legally an adult. Paying rent to your own parents at all is really unheard from in my country, like sure, you obviously move out when you have the means to do it, but in the meantime, if your family is in a good place economically, they prefer that you save your money so it's easier for you to become independent in the future (though helping out with chores is basic education at any age). But of course, if the family is struggling, it's common sense that everyone has to contribute, get a part time job while studying if needed, etc.\n\nNow, your son is definitely TA for his actions during this time. Like, cleaning up after himself and not ordering delivery while the entire family is struggling is basic decency. But honestly, kicking your own son out of the house rubs me the wrong way. Even if he's legally an adult, I believe that 19 years old is still way too young. I suppose you have spoken to him seriously about this already. Maybe try a different approach? Like, tell him that, since you're barely making ends meet, he'll have to pay for his own food from now on, and that if he doesn't clean up after himself, nobody else will. And of course, make him look for a job. Give him a deadline or something. I know it obviously doesn't depend entirely of him, but at least make sure he actually is looking for one. I just feel that kicking your own son out of the house when he doesn't even have a job and is most likely not ready for the real world should be the absolute last resort. Not to mention that nor kicking him out nor the $320 he's supposed to contribute will fix the terrible situation you're in. Is it really worth it to kick him out then? He's still your son, and parenting doesn't end at 18. It's not like there's nothing you can do for him anymore, there's still some discipline you can apply on him to make sure he's a functional adult. Just giving up on him and throwing him into the lions like this won't help him nor the rest of your family.", "The couple hundred dollars that your son was giving you per month wouldn't save you from this situation. Kicking him out isn't going to pay your bills. And though it seems like a dick move, he's eating out instead of eating your food. Yeah, if I were in his situation I would want to help my family. But he is just a typical 19 year old boy. If your family is struggling this hard, you need to look to work from home or get a regular job once your children start school. You and your husband are the leaders of this household, not your son, and you need to set an example if you want to see your son work harder.", "No, you would not BTA.  He needs a little bit of tough love.  It's unfortunate that he lost his job but there is such a thing as unemployment to tide him over until he finds another job.

I've been fortunate enough not to quite reach that level of stress. I will talk about your son a bit. Or rather I will talk about my own, and maybe you will find something applicable\n\nMy son struggled a great deal in his late teens and early 20s. College didn't work out for him, and he was in and out of work, really not knowing what he wanted to do with his life.  He basically was making enough money to pay for his own hobbies and fun. We had very little success getting him to do any chores, and there was a lot of arguing. We did give him an ultimatum of sorts. Either be in school, be in training for a trade, or work. We are not rich, but out situation was not desperate.  This meant we could afford to help a little with school, and we could collect and save his rent (to give back to him when he eventually moved out).  And we were flexible, being unhappy but forgiving when he failed to live up to his end.  \n\nAll that is context for this next bit. Aimless kids do usually find a path.

You have also stated that your husband has found new employment, so hopefully things aren't as dire. As far as the 19 year old, there is a responsibility to contribute to the household, regardless of whether or not you are financially struggling. If they can't work and pay rent, AND aren't going to school, they could at the very least, be assisting with the upkeep and cooking in the household. I don't think you're wrong to ask him to contribute or find a new place to live.

I don't have a job and spend most of the day on my computer, my father has expressed increasing frustration at me not paying for other things myself (Food and medical expenses, mainly), my dad's had some issues with money lately, he kind of wants me gone. He will tell anyone that listens that I make his life hell, I do nothing but sit on my ass all day, etc.\n\nI will tell you, reader, as the person on the other end of this- There is always more to the story and it nearly always chalks up to shitty parenting in one way or another.\n\nWhat my father wouldn't say if he made a post like this is that I'm physically disabled (Very bad case of Rotoscoliosis- Can't bend down or lift at all on a bad day, among other things undiagnosed to do with chronic/joint pain) and also in therapy dealing with a lifetime of trauma from my horrific mother and stepfather. To put it lightly, those two would go to jail if I had any proof of anything. Of course I had a terrible example. When I came to live with my father to escape those two, he expected me to know how to function like a normal human being and to this day berates me for asking him to help me or show me how to do things like do laundry or make my bed.

She is desperate for a scapegoat. \n\nIf \u201cpay your way or get out\u201d is the stance you are supporting here, you are also saying that OP\u2019s landlord should evict this family as soon as possible. I agree that the son may be an AH, OP is the bigger AH, and her problems will NOT vanish in the absence of her son.", "Not sure if you\u2019ve ever worked graveyard or know much about how it affects you physiologically but it can be intensely taxing on you with measurable, negative effects. A cursory google search can give you a range of insight & evidence a lot less anecdotal than mine. But I do recommend learning more before committing if it\u2019s something you haven\u2019t done before\u2014or, did *before* kids.", "A lot of these redditors haven't had to support themselves and do not have life experience/.", "These responses are from other Redditors about the same age who want to absolve themselves of guilt for acting in a similar manner as OP's son. The only mistake mom made here is coming to Reddit for advice.\n\nI can literally smell the rooms of the commenters from here.", "Everyone in the house sounds like an asshole. \n\nBut I think the 19yo son might be depressed or something from the sleep all day and overeating description.\n\nHe moved out a year ago, so right after he turn 18? \nWhere\u2019s his room, did the family immediately move to a smaller house and throw out his stuff, why is he sleeping on a mattress with no privacy despite bringing in 1k per week? \n\nSounds like there\u2019s no care or love from the family. \nYoung son got laid off unexpectedly and mom just opens her balance sheet, and goes \u201che\u2019s 16 weeks behind on rent\u201d", "They only moved so that the son could live with them. The money was meant to just cover the extra expenses they'd have as a result of him moving back in.", "I'd like to hear your six solutions to allow both parents to go to work with an autistic 5 year old child in the household.", "its been 13 weeks that he hasn't paid rent.... its been much longer than summer break. He's going into month 4, now.", ">  He\u2019d only need to work 31 hours a month at $7/hour to earn what they are asking.\n\nI'm pretty sure those are weekly amounts. OP mentions hes 13 weeks behind in rent", "Mine was literally 42 MINUTES past the deadline and had to wait and entire school year\u202642 minutes!!\n\nMany places are facing such a shortage of childcare spaces\u2026even worse finding affordable childcare spaces\u2026then add government subsidized spaces\u2026.you could be on a wait list for a generation to get one. \n\nWhere I am, just the program for before and after school care (so I can work a normal work day) is about 7k per kid. That\u2019s for roughly 3 hours of care a school day\u2026and that\u2019s considered reasonable.", "That sucks. \n\nWhen I was a kid my school district's cutoff date was December 1st. \n\nMy birthday is in January, which means that I was more than 5.5/almost 6 when I started kindergarten as well. \n\nOn the \"up\" side, turning 18 halfway through my senior year meant that I had 5 months during my senior year where I could look for jobs without having to get a note from my school (I went to HS in California) in order to work.", "All the kids I knew from school who came from poor families are now crack addicts. I\u2019m not coming from nowhere here. If you can\u2019t support yourself, you can\u2019t support children.

I came from poverty, abuse, and a broken home and I\u2019m not a crack addict. Neither are any of my similarly impoverished friends. Nor are the many poor kids I\u2019ve taught over the years. Again, with your way of thinking, no one would have kids. You have people in power actively working to keep people impoverished and uneducated. So you tell me again, how the people in power and of wealth should have control of reproduction, because that\u2019s the ONLY way it happens in your world. Also, you don\u2019t account for the reality of life and circumstance. It\u2019s not people\u2019s faults that the system is set up for them to stay poor. I\u2019m no less of a person because I grew up poor and neither is anyone else. I also know A LOT of rich kid drug abusers, so spare me that. Arguing this point is ridiculous so I\u2019m done with it."]}
