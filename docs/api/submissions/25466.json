This never really came into play for us since my brother and I both moved to the US for school and basketball at 17 (separately, without parents).

Even people who have a steady paycheck are supplementing their income with food banks and might be living in their cars because they can not afford rent with their paychecks.\n\nWhatever led to OP's predicament is not important at this moment- this is a family in crises. There are 3 adults in the household and at least two should be working. I see that OP stated that her husband got another job which is good. If he hadn't, I was going to suggest that they both apply for fast food jobs with opposite shifts so that one parent can remain with the youngest child at all times. I love how people suggest daycare  and/or babysitting as if these don't cost money that the family doesn't have. And even if OP worked, most of her salary would go to daycare. And depending on the severity of the child's autism, it might be difficult and costly to find care.\n\nThe 19 year old can work, even if it's part time. He has money for an x box and to order food so he can contribute to the household in which he lives. He can also stop eating more than his share of food so that everybody gets to eat. It's not a right to have your parents pay for college, it's a privilege. If your parents can not afford it,  the onus is on you to get scholarships, take out loans, get a job, etc. If he isn't in school, he needs to find a job to either contribute to the household or support himself.

Your rates and expectations were fair. \n\nHe has broken those expectations,  and due to circumstances out of your control, you're unable to make up the shortfall. It's unreasonable of him to be selfishly eating all the communal food and leaving the rest of you short. As an adult  he should be paying his way (rent, bills and food), whether that's with you or independently. If he won't contribute, he needs to make his own way in the world. If he wants to stay, he needs to prioritise finding work and paying his debt as well as being responsible for his share of the chores, not sitting around playing Xbox and adding to your workload.\n\nI don't understand why you're getting stick for being a SAHM, especially when your youngest has additional needs.
