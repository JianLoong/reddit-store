This never really came into play for us since my brother and I both moved to the US for school and basketball at 17 (separately, without parents).

Also \u2014 if he was earning $1K a week and paying about $320 a month, i see lots of opportunity to save up and move out. \n\nA question for you: where is all your contempt for this kid\u2019s father? The one who should be paying child support and potentially offering him a place to stay? Why are you saving all the contempt for the mother?", "I don\u2019t misunderstand generational wealth. Who the fuck is talking about old money?\n\nI\u2019m not going to create invisible contempt for someone that was never mentioned in the post. \n\nI come from NY where child support can be court ordered until 21- if she isn\u2019t receiving anything from their father, it\u2019s not up to the children to report that. It\u2019s on Mom again."]}
