This never really came into play for us since my brother and I both moved to the US for school and basketball at 17 (separately, without parents).

I knew a special ed teacher who told me that she was under pressure to deny IEPs and evaluate children as not needing services.

However, I agree, the 19 year old could have been responsible for taking care of the 5 year old while mom worked. Then he would at least be contributing something instead of just take, take, taking. Also, any sort of government program takes TIME to receive it. It took my husband 9 months to receive his unemployment once. I qualified for food stamps once, but because I had a whole whopping 500 dollars in the bank I did not qualify for emergency food stamps.

Proceeding through the school district would have given us group therapy at the district, which would have been completely inadequate to her needs. We had in-home one-on-one therapy multiple times a week for many years, which was expensive but changed her life. Her personality has been shaped by her early inability to be understood, but thank God she can be understood now (e.g., she told me she never asks for help because as a little kid, whenever she asked for help, the person she asked could never understand her, so she just learned to muddle through). \n\nI'm actually a lawyer, BTW. And yes, there is a federal law, but that doesn't mean all the school districts are equal. There are huge disparities. And I would be careful about sounding like its's the parents' fault if a kid doesn't get what they need. At parent-teacher night at the SF school my daughter went to, a huge number of the parents (possibly a majority) did not speak English and relied upon their kid to translate and explain things to them.
