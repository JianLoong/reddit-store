Instead, this will likely be the gift everyone wants and admires.  You are generous to donate both your funds and your time.", "NTA\nBut...

Why don't you just say that it is handmade or put a little note on it? You should stick to the rules (which you do) and i think something selfmade is way more beautiful than something store-bought", "NTA I think it\u2019s fine but if you\u2019re really worried about it, maybe ask your neighbor if it would cause problems as they might know how it might be perceived", "NTA. Id say perfectly fine. There isnt much expectation of getting a great gift under $15 anyway. But if spent $9 and it looks great, thats a pass in my book", "NTA - that sounds fine. have fun", "NTA\n\nTo be honest though, I\u2019d be less worried about \u201cone-upping\u201d people and more that people would be annoyed at homemade stuff when they spent $.  With a $15 limit I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine, but not everyone puts the same (or any) value on handmade items.  So if it were a higher amount and someone spent their money, they might not feel that they got something comparable back.", "NAH - youre fine.", "INFO: how much time did you spend on the project?

What about adding in the elements you had and your labor cost? Imagine you're selling on etsy and have to factor those into the sale, would it be over 15?\n\nNTA either way, but if you are worried about the perceived cost, do some math on what it would  cost.", "I got so screwed on Friday I got a $21 Anker bluetooth speaker as my gift, and I got a hand held balancing metal stick thing for pro cameras or camcorders labelled 2018 and when I looked it up online it sells for $8\n\nNobody admitted to bringing it. I didn't make a big deal but what a shitty low effort gift", "It does add to its value, but not the cost if the gifter chooses not to address that. Because if time is money then each person should only be spending an hour of their pay on something. The idea of a price range is so that no one feels cheated when gifting/receiving the gifts amongst acquaintances especially; if OP doesn\u2019t feel cheated when she receives socks then all is well. I could see more people deciding to get creative in the future and some coveting the more creative gifts which is all in good fun.", "I probably wouldn\u2019t do that.  That feels like you\u2019re fishing for compliments and seems really awkward.  If people comment or ask and it naturally comes up then of course share that it was handmade.  But otherwise I\u2019d keep quiet.", "> Who even buys socks as a gift?\n\nAll of my favorite people, lol. As a kid, I used to hate getting socks for christmas. Now, as an adult, I hate getting crap that clutters my house, but freaking love a good pair of darntoughs.", "Sign it or add a label   \"Made by Jane 12/2023\"", "LOL, NTA\n\nMy Mother was in an art association back in the 80s and they had a $5 gift swap. So, Mom and I went to the church Christmas fair which included a white elephant and found cool things to use in a still life for under $2 (lace-trimmed hanky, pottery, knicknacks, etc for 25-50 cents each), then went to an art supply place and found a small pad of paper on sale and added it to the grouping.\n\nEveryone was all - this person spent TOO Much! But actually, we didn't - we were just clever.\n\nOne Yankee Swap, I brought a pair of beer glasses from a local brewery which cost me nothing as I got them as a free promotion when I was a bartender - they were the most desired and traded for gift. I was clearing out things, so it was a win-win.\n\nI think your mosaic sounds wonderful.", "NTA this sounds wonderful!\nJust one remark: do not put all your heart in it, handcrafted pieces are sometimes not everybody's Taste. I remeber some stories in the past, where people got quite mean about it. Gifting some bought stuff first could be a helpful protection if such people are around there.", "In your shoes I would wait to get to know the group's other members properly first before taking a gift that will stand out from the others.  Maybe get something along the lines you mentioned this year (socks, mugs, bookmark etc) and hold onto the gift you made till next Christmas.", "NTA I think you're overthinking this. I'm all for someone tooting their own horn and you do say it doesn't seem like the gift would be more than $20 were it actually store bought. But I would bet that the group would not see this is \"one-upping\" and instead either a. appreciate that it's handmade which is thoughtful, or b. feel you went the cheaper route by saving money to make the thing yourself. But ultimately we're talking $15 amongst casual friends in a group, nothing to lose sleep over.", "NAH I don\u2019t see a problem. \n\nThere\u2019s no conflict here.", "NAH\nWhile your time is valuable and it does technically add to the overall gift \u201cmoney value\u201d, I don\u2019t think it would be an issue and the materials weren\u2019t overly expensive either. \n\nI feel like $15 is such a low stake & even if you spent a couple of hours on it, I can\u2019t imagine people asking so they can count the \u201clabor cost.\u201d", "NTA but you\u2019re overthinking this. Just ask your neighbor since they invited you and any impression you make will also reflect on them. They also know the group better so they will know if the gift will be appreciated or not. If they say it\u2019s a no-go, just buy the bookmarks/socks/book light and be done with it.", "NTA.\n\nDon't discount the value of your labor and artistic skills! Add that in and you might have easily hit or slightly exceeded the $15. Tell people it's handmade; book club folks tend to be under the broad umbrella of types who really appreciate/enjoy handmade stuff. And if what you made is super-cute, you may just find yourself with some new potential clients for your art! (Just be sure to charge accordingly. Don't undersell your value.)", "Just make it known that you hand-made the gift", "NTA- in the USA, skilled labor is a minimum of $100.00 per hour.", "Nta.  I shop clearance for gift exchange.   $15 of bed bath and beyond at 75% off is a decent gift and thrifty", "NTA. Times are tough and making presents is almost cheaper (and often is) then buying gifts.", "NTA I think is this the whole idea of this tradition", "NTA but consider your labor for another person (even for funsies) is actually worth money and that can be a slippery slope.", "YWNBTA. Maybe if it looked worth $50 or more because you used your bulk-purchased materials and spent hours making a professional quality piece of soldered metal jewelry but it \"technically\" only cost you $15, then it would be weird - we tend to look at *value* for these things rather than the actual money spent for the purchase.\n\nBut the difference of maybe $5 is completely negligible. No one is going to nitpick over that. If they *are* nitpicking over it, *they* are probably TA and feeling inadequate because your thing is cool and getting more attention than theirs, which is a really weird way to behave at a gift exchange of any kind lol.", "YTA. No one is going to ask for receipts. Your gift will be perceived as not respecting the limit.", "NTA...sounds a lovely gift. Maybe put a little card with it saying handmade with love so they know you've not spent loads if that makes sense?", "Remember to value your time. Give yourself at least minimum wage when doing the calculation. Item if well made (sure it is) is worth over the limit. But don't see that as a major issue if you explain the hobby.", "This here.", "This exactly. I used to be into jewelry making and made a friend a pair of earrings as a birthday gift, then overheard her mom and sister saying how cheap and tacky it was of me to go for something handmade instead of actually spending money for a gift.", "I\u2019m sorry they were so rude! With a gift I think handmade items can be wonderful, and no one is owed a gift.\n\nGift exchanges get a bit iffier for me.  It\u2019s more transactional that everyone brings something worth $X and takes home something worth $X.  So in that case I think you can be upset that you spent $25 or whatever and ended up with something handmade that you personally don\u2019t see any value in.  \n\nI think OP is fine as $15 is low stakes anyway, but any higher and I\u2019d skip the handmade items unless you know the group will appreciate them", "I think we\u2019re saying the same thing. An hour of work, sure! 3 hours? Probably over $15", "$15 is the upper limit, there will probably be gifts worth a few dollars less because usually you won't find anything for exactly the right price. OP spend $9 on materials specifically for this gift and also used some stuff they already had, so it sounds like the material value is already close to $15.", "Agreed.  And again for $15 I think it\u2019s fine regardless.   But I think there\u2019s something to be said for usable items and in many cases that\u2019s what people expect in a gift exchange.  You will use/consume a book, bookmark, socks, mug, coffee/tea/cocoa set, etc."]}
