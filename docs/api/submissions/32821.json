Why don't you just say that it is handmade or put a little note on it? You should stick to the rules (which you do) and i think something selfmade is way more beautiful than something store-bought", "NTA I think it\u2019s fine but if you\u2019re really worried about it, maybe ask your neighbor if it would cause problems as they might know how it might be perceived", "NTA. Id say perfectly fine. There isnt much expectation of getting a great gift under $15 anyway. But if spent $9 and it looks great, thats a pass in my book", "NTA - that sounds fine. have fun", "NTA\n\nTo be honest though, I\u2019d be less worried about \u201cone-upping\u201d people and more that people would be annoyed at homemade stuff when they spent $.  With a $15 limit I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine, but not everyone puts the same (or any) value on handmade items.  So if it were a higher amount and someone spent their money, they might not feel that they got something comparable back.", "NAH - youre fine.", "INFO: how much time did you spend on the project?

I didn't make a big deal but what a shitty low effort gift", "It does add to its value, but not the cost if the gifter chooses not to address that. Because if time is money then each person should only be spending an hour of their pay on something. The idea of a price range is so that no one feels cheated when gifting/receiving the gifts amongst acquaintances especially; if OP doesn\u2019t feel cheated when she receives socks then all is well. I could see more people deciding to get creative in the future and some coveting the more creative gifts which is all in good fun.", "I probably wouldn\u2019t do that.

Now, as an adult, I hate getting crap that clutters my house, but freaking love a good pair of darntoughs."]}
