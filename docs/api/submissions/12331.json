Although, the fact that it was All the friends (not knowing how many people were there), may indicate that op was more frustrated or angry then they thought.", "I mean some people will say folks are yelling when they feel uncomfortable, kinda like how people will say someone is \"hostile\" or \"difficult to work with\" when they're giving valid criticisms", "Stupid take. Being anything other than positive and welcoming can make some people uncomfortable.", "This question belies a lack of experience. There are a ton of people who believe standing up for yourself in any context makes you bad.", "A lot of people now days especially younger people hate it when people advocate for themselves. They are so afraid to be considered a Karen for even complaining on something that shouldn\u2019t have happened. Add that to the fact they said the friends are socially awkward then I can see how someone raising their voice when angry can take it as someone shouting, when in fact they were just raising their voice in anger (which almost everyone does). This restaurant is in the wrong and I would have also gotten upset if I had to pay for their mistake. NTA", "Why didn't his friends stand up for him?", "Probably because they're too afraid of any type of confrontation. I had a time at a restaurant where myself and my friends got our food and started eating. As I'm eating my food, the staff asks us to get up and move our food to a different table as some regulars like to sit where we are sitting. I calmly refused and said they should've said something before they brought us our food or had signs to reserve the table, as it's really degrading and disrespectful. They gave some push back and my friends folded and got up and moved while I sat there disgusted and confused, just wanting to enjoy my meal. I even ended up paying for the food still since my friends couldn't handle me trying to stick up for what's right. I cut those friends out of my life after about a year or so.", "I once ate out and my order came back completely wrong, my friends saw me looking for our waiter to tell them, I was begged not to even mention it, so even just saying \"this isn't what I ordered\" would have been too much for my friends", "The friend also said that OP should have just paid for the extra steak and not argued at all. So clearly the friend doesn't like any confrontation at all and is probably uncomfortable with any kind of arguing.", "Well I never condone yelling in any situation. But OP was not yelling at them because they messed up the order. He was yelling because they were deliberately charging him double for messing up their order and not correcting the bill. Yes he should have asked for a manager but honestly I would not have payed double either. Also assuming they took back the well done steak and never gave it to him.", "The waiter was definitely trying to pull a fast one on OP, thinking they wouldn't speak up about it. They most likely entered the steak order in wrong the first time, and then when they had to re-order another correct one from the kitchen they tried to add it onto the bill as a second steak, probably so that they wouldn't get in trouble with their manager or the kitchen.\n\nIn this case I would say it's a more serious situation than your order being \"messed up.\"", "Like you, I\u2019ve also worked in many restaurants (25+ years experience, actually) which is why I offered my insight regarding your question.\n\nI fully agree with your description of check procedure- if a manager can\u2019t immediately comp, then split it off to be done later. That\u2019s why I mentioned the waiter not preparing the bill correctly or being too lazy to fix his mistake", "Maybe so but we don't know the rest of the story. The waiter explained why he was getting charged twice, he wasn't arguing at that point. The argument started after the waiter said that and OP didn't provide the rest of the story.", "Honestly, sometimes you can't considering how dark some restaurants keep their lighting.  Taking a bite is perfectly acceptable to see whether you can enjoy the food or not.  The proof of the pudding, after all, is in the eating.", "You might be able to, but you might also not. I personally don't inspect my food before eating and trust the restaurant to cook the food i ordered.", "He might\u2019ve taken a note then realized it was well done. You can\u2019t tell from looking at the outside some steaks look well done on the outside and they\u2019re nice and pink in the middle. Then you take a bite or two and say wait minute that\u2019s well done. Then you cut into it a little more to check", "no bites... you cut into the steak, you return the steak without taking any bites. Why would anyone take a bite of a steak they didn't want? Why takes one or two bites of an overdone steak to see when it's clear from cutting into it that it's overdone.\n\nNo one cuts a piece, shows their friends it's overdone with the intent to return, and then eats the piece? wtf. \n\nOP clearly ate too much of the steak and is obfuscating that part of it.", "If you're at a restaurant, you assume they (the people paid to cook professionally) cook your steak to required doneness: you don't consciously change your eating habits to \"check doneness\". \n\nI order my steak blue.  If I cut a slice from the very edge I expect it to be \"overcooked\", so I could very easily and happily eat a few mouthfuls before realising that the whole thing is, in fact, overdone.", "Nah, I could see trying a bite to see if it's still okay, then making the decision to send it back.\n\nNTA", "I'm so tired of these questions about whether someone acted appropriately only to be accused by friends or family of being overly confrontational or some crap.

The server is running a scam on OP, fuck them.", "... and that's what businesses with sleazy practices count on when they overprice or overcharge. They expect people to just shake their heads, tighten their lips and pay in silence.", "In some ways I hate these people more than the ones who fuck everything up around themselves and necessitate confrontation in the first place. \n\nIf you wanna be a meek little worm about everything, mote power to you, and if I'm being *rude* please stop me. But don't try to make me the bad guy for asking for my money back when it's owed.", "My wife is like this. I raise my voice in general when I'm agitated, whether it's excitement while talking about something I love OR from getting angry about something, but she equates it to \"yelling\" because of the tone and is uncomfortable because I'm not usually confrontational.", "This. \n\nThere are people I know that will go to literally any length to avoid confrontation, especially in situations like this. \n\nI have a very simple rule I live by: I will never pay for things or services that are not fulfilled. \n\nI am more than happy to pay and tip at a restaurant. But I'd personally do a charge back if this happened to me and they can get $0. \n\nAbsolutely no reason to refuse to a refund for something they messed up. I shouldn't have to ask for a C suite executive to get a refund. If the waiter isn't going to initiate that, I don't really think it's my responsibility to do their job. They can get $0 and maybe if that happens enough they will change their policy.", "Not true at all.\n\nWell, maybe with the current young'ns, but, in general, most people don't have that attitude.", "I know one or 2 like this.................and when you stand up to them YOU are the problem......................NOT.

I\u2019m not sure what else you\u2019re looking for.", "You can literally always tell if you look at it, but it doesn\u2019t matter. They served him the wrong thing it\u2019s their responsibility", "They clearly wanted a steak else they wouldn't have ordered one. Your logic makes perfect sense for someone who goes into a restaurant *expecting* them to fuck up their steak, but some people actually expect that what they're eating is what they ordered when it ends up in their mouth.", "Don't be ridiculous, it's perfectly acceptable to return food after tasting it. \n\nSteak sometimes cooks unevenly.

You are tired of being \"nice\" and compliant.  \n\nSome older people really are like the Karen meme and need to be called out.
