Getting heated with the waiter doesn\u2019t help.  Going to the person with the authority to do something probably would.", "I think it\u2019s a mistake to punch down.  If it had been me I\u2019d have asked for the manager.", "ESH.\n\nIt's understandable that you were frustrated with being charged for both steaks when the restaurant made a mistake with your order. The waiter messed up because, as long as you didn\u2019t eat the steak before you sent it back, there\u2019s no way you should\u2019ve been charged for *their* mistake.\n\nHowever, arguing and shouting with/at the waiter and causing a scene may not have been the best way to handle the situation. Next time ask for the manager and explain the situation in a calm and respectful manner.", "NTA:\n\nThe first steak was prepared incorrectly and they took it back (you did not eat it). They have no right to charge you for that (it was their error, they acknowledged that and took the steak back) and you really should have stood firm on your refusal to pay for that first one. That's not selfish, that's just paying for what you ordered/received.\n\nThe fault for any scene lies with the restaurant for trying to overcharge you.\n\nNow, naturally, I don't know what language you used with the waiter or what the tone of voice was, so it's possible you were both correct and rude, but seeing as how the restaurant created the situation I can't call you an asshole for that (unless you were really *that* rude...).", "I mean, idk what kind of scene you caused, maybe asking to speak to a manager (I know, I know) would have been better. \n\nI've never heard of a restaurant making the customer pay for the restaurant's mistake. Did they let you keep the overdone steak, too?", "As a waitress myself I wouldn't have charged you twice for the meal, I've had to change peoples food lots of times. You don't add it again. Understandable that you asked about it cause places don't normally do that but I don't know what you did to make everyone uncomfortable.\n\nYou should have asked to speak to a manager about the issue really, cause we just follow whatever the rules are.", "NTA I hate confrontation with a passion, and I would not have blamed you. That is an extremely unusual policy. I would not have been ok paying. Most places, if it is a mistake in the cook, or heck even figuring out quickly you don't like it, they have a lot of grace on fixing food. Being rude to waitstaff is obviously not a good thing, but this sounds like a valid thing to push back on.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t pay for their mistake", "NTA. They messed up your order, the restaurant should've covered the cost of the new steak. Next time don't argue with the waiter if they're refusing to comp the messed up meal, ask for a manager.", "NTA- you shouldn't pay for wrong order...they screwed up and they should pay", "NTA. Either the waiter made a mistake or the kitchen did. In neither case should you be expected to pay for their error.", "YTA. The waiter isn\u2019t in the back cooking your steak. \nShouting? You\u2019re legit shouting at another person over food. If you\u2019re this stressed out, go to therapy, not restaurants where you\u2019re shouting at another human knowing you\u2019ll have no repercussions. In fact, shouting and expecting to be rewarded", "NTA and what sort of restaurant charges a customer twice for an order they got wrong in the first case. It was their mistake and its upto them to incurr the expense. Do write a decent review about the restaurant for charging you double and most people would have simply refused to pay for the wrong order. Also tell your friend to grow a spine as you were neither selfish or unreasonable to ask for what you didn't consume to be taken off your bill. I wouldn't personally ever go back to that restaurant as they suck at customer service.", "Info:\n\n\nHow much of the first steak did you eat?", "NTA.  You shouldn't have been charged for both.  Time to leave some reviews...", "NTA if you just argued as you were in the right, but YTA if you actually shouted at the waiter, who isn't responsible for the decision. Don't shoot the messenger.", "Oh hell no. Now forgive me if this was some kinda hella high class place cuz I ain't never been so it might be different but even then when u order something a certain way and it's not right then you shouldn't be charged for their mistake. And if that is the case then the waitress or waiter should have to tell that. Even then it just sounds wrong to made to pay for a mistake that's beyond your control.", "ESH bc why the hell would they charge you for another steak when they messed up the first one?? Dumbassery. But also, you should never be yelling at a server. Maybe ask for their manager next time.", "ESH. The restaurant shouldn\u2019t be charging him for a second steak when they messed up the first one, but he also shouldn\u2019t be yelling at the staff. Best course of action is to ask for a manager.", "It was definitely frustrated voices I wouldn't shout at waiting staff as I know the struggle as I have been one myself. But my friends told me it wasn't the fault of the waiter as I technically did order both", "It depends when he started shouting. If it was only after the waiter pushed back several times then he's really not TAH. It's basically theft what happened to him. There's only so long a person can stay reasonable when they are being extorted.", "And a customer should not have to escalate the situation to the manager. And the waiter argued back anyways when they should have got the manager. YTA for saying he's the AH. He didn't get what he ordered nor did he eat it. \nNTA", "Agreed! ESH I don\u2019t get all these N T A votes bc while the restaurant sucks and was in the wrong, he still shouldn\u2019t be yelling at the staff. Should\u2019ve asked for a manager.", "OP\u2019s headline said they shouted.  That\u2019d be the part that made people uncomfortable.", "ESH. The restaurant shouldn\u2019t be charging him for a second steak when they messed up the first one, but he also shouldn\u2019t be yelling at the staff.

One of my pet peeves is when someone posts here then does not respond promptly to pertinent questions like this.", "Then why didn't you ask for a manager as surely you knew the waiter had no power to change the bill", "But you never asked for the well-done steak.  You shouldn\u2019t have been charged for it, unless you ate more than a bite or two before sending it back.", "Tell them no technically you ordered 1 medium rare steak and recieved 1 medium rare steak.  A well done steak may be similar but not the same order.  \n\n\nIf they ordered Soft Tacos & recieved Hard Tacos which were taken back and replaced with soft tacos would they be okay with paying for both? I think not. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", ">But my friends told me it wasn't the fault of the waiter as I technically did order both\n\nThe hell you did! \n\nYou ordered a medium-rare steak and they messed up. Messed up your order, messed up your meal, messed up your evening, and to top it off, tried to screw you on the bill!\n\nBut like others have pointed out, just get the manager involved right away.", "You say in your response to the judgement bot that you shouted at the waiter. Did you, or didn\u2019t you raise your voice?", "From OPs post it sounds more like \nOP: why have I been charged for both?\nWaiter: unfortunately as we had to cook you 2 steaks we have to charge for both \nOP: argues", "Considering op did comment under the post, this feels very intentional and is definitly annoying.", "No I didn't shout though I admit I raised my voice a bit it was more because my friends seemed to be crawling into their skin so I didn't escalate the shouting and just left it as I didn't want to cause a major problem"]}
