He should never have had to pay for 2 steaks.. even if only to make his friend happy.", "Clearly, since OP ended up paying for two steaks, they actually argued with the waiter for less time than was necessary.", "Your \u201cevidence\u201d you put in quotes doesn\u2019t actually prove your point lol. I think you need to re-read it.\n\nIt honestly does seem like one conversation OP had with the waiter when the bill came out. It just sounds like OP and their friends are young, and the friends want to avoid conflict even if they are in the right (which OP was).\n\nI have a feeling you\u2019re young as well. Once you get older, you realize how silly these situations are to get worked up over. Usually it can be handled with a simple conversation like OP tried having with the waiter.", "I'm a waitress too, at my work were told to get a manager as soon as a customer mentions any kind of issue. This may not be policy where OP went or the waiter may be new and still finding their feet\nEither way, yelling at staff is not OK.

You should have cut into it then sent it back after seeing it wasn't done properly. It is impossible for you to have not known then that it was wrong unless you picked up the entire thing on your fork and took a bite that way. And why would you even need to eat it to show your friends? The difference between medium rare and well done are so vastly different in both look and feel. Even with cutting it.", "The post says OP argued, nothing about anything from the waiter after explaining the bill\nIf OPs reaction is anything like some of the customers who've come to where I work then the poor guy probably couldn't get a word in.

I'm not paying to leave empty handed when the only ones who did something wrong worked for the restaurant.\n\nIf OP had eaten more than a couple bites I would feel differently (I have seen people eat a whole steak before complaining, that's not a situation where they deserve anything comped).", "Two bites is fine to have before sending something back. First bite you might think it was just that mouthful that could be overcooked. You cut into it more, realise it's not cooked properly. You try a second bite to see if you can put up with it, you can't, you send it back. Hell sometimes you don't realise something is bad until you get to the middle. The only thing OP did wrong was complain to the waiter and not the manager", "i'm a server and no, OP is not an AH for eating 2 bites of steak then sending it back. that is fine. if they ate half+ of it, then it would be an issue.", "> If OPs reaction is anything like some of the customers who've come to where I work then the poor guy probably couldn't get a word in\n\nSo you're judging OP as being as bad as the worse customers you get? Interesting take and a bold assumption that that someone trying to get their bill corrected wouldn't let the person correcting the bill get a word into the conversation. It sounds like you're projecting rather than being objective.\n\nA professional would have called their manager over, especially as waiters usually supposed to deal with complaints as they aren't approved to rectify the situation. Waiter fucked up by double charging and rather than check with other staff whet the policy really is, or get a manager to explain the policy to the customer, he doubled down. He frustrated the customer to the point the customer left, having been greatly overcharged and having a terrible experience in the restaurant. The restaurant lost custom and part of their reputation over what, an overcooked steak that can't be resold and has to be thrown away regardless?\n\nIf OP  wasn't shouting (apparently no raised voices) then his only mistake was not ignoring the waiter and asking for a manager directly, and that doesn't make him TA.", "How would you not notice the difference between a medium rare and a well done steak while cutting it though? Especially if he's using a seratted steak knife. It's two entirely different amounts of effort and feel. Well done steaks are generally more stiff through the entire cut. Hell, op even said it was tough.", "Two bites of a filet mignon could very easily be near half of a steak though.", "I'm judging based on the fact title says they shouted and OP has said in comment they raised their voice. Manager is probably the one who added the second steak to the bill. We don't know if the waiter is new but I know from my own experience working in not just hospitality but also customer service that when a customer starts to raise their voice its a challenge to be able to speak or even be heard", "Maybe OP cut a piece from the edge, not cut a hole in the middle of the steak? Edges cook more through than the centre, so you can end up with a medium well piece in a medium rare steak.\n\nYou're complaining that OP didn't dissect the steak thoroughly before deciding it was good enough to put in his mouth, which is nonsense. He *could* have done that if he wanted to, but that's not what you're obligated or supposed to do. Unless he ate most of it and asked for a refund then OP did nothing wrong. He didn't ask for a refund, he returned it and asked for a replacement.", "Doesn't matter in the slightest", "The title says shouting but OP has clarified the there were no raised voices, it was an argument. It shouldn't have been an argument, either OP asks for the manager or the waiter does his job and gets the manager.\n\nYou're making so many wild assumptions! What makes you think the manager stepped in to manually run a second steak through someone's order at full price?\n\nYou're projecting wildly, you're not being objective and you're defending unprofessional behaviour because you feel personally attacked because you're in the same industry. It's ok to feel defensive, but the OP did nothing wrong, the waiter acted unprofessionally and didn't escalate the situation to a manager."]}
