However, I was running 15-30 minutes late as I got ready. While I was in the bathroom, she began to cry and shout loudly. When I rushed out, I found her sobbing uncontrollably and sitting on the floor for support. She expressed her frustration about potentially missing the open house.\n\nAlthough we typically attend open houses every weekend and can often visit on Sundays if we miss one on Saturday, I responded to her distress by saying, \"I am ready and I was already hurrying up in the bathroom. You have grown up. Even now why are you crying like a child for something so small as that. Even if we can't make it to the open house today because it gets closed, it will still be open tomorrow and we can go. You are 32 years old, and still you show childishness, maybe you think it seems hot or something.\"\n\nAfter this, I got dressed and asked if we were still going. My wife angrily grabbed frozen chicken from the freezer, slammed it into the fridge, and said, \"You're right. So this is your shelf in the refrigerator. This is your chicken. From now on, you'll cook for yourself and sleep in the hall. I'll lock the bedroom door.\"\n\nFor the past five days, she has remained in the locked bedroom, leaving only for bathroom breaks and meals. We live in a one-bedroom apartment, so I've been forced to sleep on the carpeted living room floor. We don't have a bed or couch in the living room, and she is only cooking for herself, so I've been eating out or cooking on my own.\n\nOn the first night, I knocked on the locked bedroom door, asking for my pillow so I could sleep in the living room. She replied, \"Fuck yourself.\" I asked again for the pillow, and she said, \"Fuck yourself. Fuck yourself outside. You're saying I'm 32 years old and not sexy anymore. Your face is as dark as your asshole.\" Note that I never said you are 32 years and not sexy anymore. I only said 32 years and acting childish, maybe you think it is hot or something.\n\nWe are both Asian Indian with brown skin, but my complexion is darker than hers, so her comment felt offensive. I chose not to respond to avoid escalating the situation, as she might have started screaming and disturbing our neighbors. Instead, I slept on a bedsheet on the floor, using a blanket as a pillow.", "created_utc": 1681987534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12subsu/aita_for_labeling_my_wifes_tears_as_immature_and/", "score": 356, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And also said maybe even though she is 32 years old, she thinks it's hot or something showing childishness like this. So I want this action of mine to tell her crying as childishness to be judged.\n(2) Since I labeled her as childish, it may probably feel as though I was completely insensitive.

This weekend was one of the rare ones in which I did not plan much and she looked at one house in the app and told me on Friday night that we should go tomorrow. So, that's why her uncontrollable crying seemed more so unreasonable because 1) we are just looking and have not yet made the commitment among ourselves that we are buying. 2) we have gone to many open houses and have not felt attached to any specific house. 3) It was just Saturday, so there was still Sunday available if we aren't able to make it on that day.", "What are the subjects of conversation with your parent?\n\nIs she reacting to you talking to your parents, or to what is being said?

Stressful enough. \nThey want to go to an open house, op is 30 minutes late. His wife gets upset instead of apologising for being late, they berate her for being upset at them. \n\nWife then stops cooking for him, stops doing his chores and leaves him to his own devices. He\u2019s now crying to Reddit because she isn\u2019t letting him sleep beside her and she isn\u2019t doing anything for him?! \n\nSeems to me it was a build up of bs from op and she snapped. I wouldn\u2019t be sleeping beside my husband if he called me unattractive.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
