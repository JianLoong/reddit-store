However, I was running 15-30 minutes late as I got ready. While I was in the bathroom, she began to cry and shout loudly. When I rushed out, I found her sobbing uncontrollably and sitting on the floor for support. She expressed her frustration about potentially missing the open house.\n\nAlthough we typically attend open houses every weekend and can often visit on Sundays if we miss one on Saturday, I responded to her distress by saying, \"I am ready and I was already hurrying up in the bathroom. You have grown up. Even now why are you crying like a child for something so small as that. Even if we can't make it to the open house today because it gets closed, it will still be open tomorrow and we can go. You are 32 years old, and still you show childishness, maybe you think it seems hot or something.\"\n\nAfter this, I got dressed and asked if we were still going. My wife angrily grabbed frozen chicken from the freezer, slammed it into the fridge, and said, \"You're right. So this is your shelf in the refrigerator. This is your chicken. From now on, you'll cook for yourself and sleep in the hall. I'll lock the bedroom door.\"\n\nFor the past five days, she has remained in the locked bedroom, leaving only for bathroom breaks and meals. We live in a one-bedroom apartment, so I've been forced to sleep on the carpeted living room floor. We don't have a bed or couch in the living room, and she is only cooking for herself, so I've been eating out or cooking on my own.\n\nOn the first night, I knocked on the locked bedroom door, asking for my pillow so I could sleep in the living room. She replied, \"Fuck yourself.\" I asked again for the pillow, and she said, \"Fuck yourself. Fuck yourself outside. You're saying I'm 32 years old and not sexy anymore. Your face is as dark as your asshole.\" Note that I never said you are 32 years and not sexy anymore. I only said 32 years and acting childish, maybe you think it is hot or something.\n\nWe are both Asian Indian with brown skin, but my complexion is darker than hers, so her comment felt offensive. I chose not to respond to avoid escalating the situation, as she might have started screaming and disturbing our neighbors. Instead, I slept on a bedsheet on the floor, using a blanket as a pillow.", "created_utc": 1681987534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12subsu/aita_for_labeling_my_wifes_tears_as_immature_and/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And also said maybe even though she is 32 years old, she thinks it's hot or something showing childishness like this. So I want this action of mine to tell her crying as childishness to be judged.\n(2) Since I labeled her as childish, it may probably feel as though I was completely insensitive.

This weekend was one of the rare ones in which I did not plan much and she looked at one house in the app and told me on Friday night that we should go tomorrow. So, that's why her uncontrollable crying seemed more so unreasonable because 1) we are just looking and have not yet made the commitment among ourselves that we are buying. 2) we have gone to many open houses and have not felt attached to any specific house. 3) It was just Saturday, so there was still Sunday available if we aren't able to make it on that day.", "What are the subjects of conversation with your parent?\n\nIs she reacting to you talking to your parents, or to what is being said?

Since she needed to ask.   \nYou can't have it both ways.", "I would say maybe opinion or observation.\n\nAnd, no, I don't believe OP is a child for his wife to care for. I just used that analogy to indicate that, in both cases, it is not acceptable to kick someone out of their room and leave them to sleep on the floor."]}
