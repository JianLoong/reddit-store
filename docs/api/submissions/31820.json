I also have Josh, 16m from another relationship (long story.) Joe and I divorced 8 years ago. Joe is remarried and has a kid with his new wife, that kid just turned 1.\n\nToday, Josh had to be at an activity for several hours and all kids under 18 had to have an adult present. I didn't sleep well last night and had a headache today so I told Molly that she needed to take Josh because otherwise he couldn't go. Molly initially refused and told me to ask her grandparents (my parents) but they just returned from a trip out of state and are tired from traveling. I didn't have anyone else to ask and ended up telling Molly either she takes Josh or he doesn't go at all. Molly finally agreed to take Josh. I guess Molly called Joe and told him she couldn't come to the kid's birthday party because I \"forced\" her to take Josh to his activity, which was planned out way in advance. Joe called and went off on me for \"making\" Molly miss the party, that I was being manipulative and should have taken an advil, sucked it up and took Josh or found anyone else to take him. I tried explaining to Joe that I had a headache and it was too last minute to find anyone else so Molly was my only option, if she didn't do it, Josh would have to miss out on something he's been looking forward to for a long time. Joe had some more choice words for me and hung up. Later when I told Molly her dad was unreasonably upset over her missing a baby's party, Molly actually sided with Joe and that surprised me. Now I'm wondering if maybe I was in the wrong?", "created_utc": 1701051474, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184rygv/aita_for_making_my_daughter_miss_my_exs_kids/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Clearly Molly wanted to attend her younger siblings party and quite frankly you did make her miss the celebration. You literally backed her in a corner where she had to choose between her siblings, which is more than wrong. It may not seem important to you or a big deal because it doesn\u2019t involve you, however, Molly, and that child share blood. First birthdays are typically a big deal, so I am quite sure the birthday party was not just planned out of the blue that day, which means you knew of this prior engagement, you just didn\u2019t give a damn. \n\nWere other classmates at this event? Did Josh have friends who attended? Could one of his friend\u2019s parents allow him to car pool with them? Could you not have taken some pain meds and dropped him to the event, then picked him up later? There were a lot of other alternatives, that you clearly did not care to consider. You\u2019re selfish and need to get over yourself.", "YTA. Molly and Joe are right...Josh is not Molly\u2019s responsibility, he\u2019s yours, period dot.   \n\n\nSo is Josh an affair baby?", "I gotta go with YTA.\n\nYou forced your adult daughter to chaperone her younger brother, who by your timeline was conceived while you were still with your ex.\n\nWith no consideration to if she wanted to go to this party or not.\n\nIt seems like being with her half-sibling was important and you just ignored that.", "YTA not sure why forced is in quotes - you did", "YTA - you put the burden of being a parent on your teenage daughter. Did you ask your parents? Did you take any medication? What activity was it? Was there no one else going that you knew that could have watched him?\n\nShe\u2019s 18. She could be moving out or going to college, what are you going to do then?\n\nWas this headache or migraine level? Like you could have tried to suck it up.", "YTA. Honestly, I agree with your ex here. So you were tired and had a headache? Take some ibuprofen and power through it for the sake of your kid. It's one day, you'll survive. Josh is not Molly's responsibility, he's YOURS. It was unfair of you to put Molly in that position. Do better.", "Who gets to stop being a parent because they have a headache?  YTA", "YTA.\n\nBoth your children had obligations. It was your job to do what you could so both children could make their commitments.\n\nIt sounds like you didn\u2019t even ask your parents or try other options.\n\nIt also sounds like you either value your son\u2019s commitments over your daughter\u2019s or you intentionally want to sabotage your daughter\u2019s relationship with her father and her sibling.\n\nNeither are a good look.", "Sometimes as parents, we have to make sacrifices for our children. Our other children should NOT have to do this for their siblings.\n\nSorry OP but YTA here. Molly had important plans, but even if she didn\u2019t, it was not on her to spend the day with Josh at his event. You also made Molly feel guilty for not wanting to take him as YOU were unwilling to be a parent for Josh. \n\nYou should have had some coffee and taken some Tylenol and taken your son. This is completely on you.", "YTA \n\nThis isn't your ex's kid. It's your daughter's baby brother. In my eyes you just told her that her brother through you is more important.\n\nYou have a headache take some Excedrin and nut up for your kid.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re the parent not Molly and I don\u2019t believe for a second that you didn\u2019t know what you were doing. You used your kid as a weapon against your ex\u2026 bravo, the shitty parent award goes to\u2026", "YTA -sometimes we have to do do things when we have a headache. Selfish af. That isn\u2019t just your \u201cexs kid\u201d that\u2019s your daughter sibling.", "YTA. Did you really need to ask?  Seriously?  I suppose there is a slight chance you didn\u2019t do this intentionally.  But from your language\n\u201cthe kid\u2019s birthday\u201d and the timing, it sure reads like you did this intentionally.\n\nAnd your daughter appears to be far more honest than you.  You did. \u201cForce\u201d her.  That is exactly what you did.", "YTA.  It's on you to see that Josh can attend, not your daughter.  Also, you seem to have some difficulties grasping that 'ex's baby' is as much Molly's brother as Josh is.", "I love how all the responses are rightfully calling you out for being the asshole and you\u2019re just continuing to prove them right with your comments lol. YTA", "So based on your comments you\u2019re a gold digging, former addict who cheated on her ex and had another man\u2019s baby and now you resent the fact that he moved on and you\u2019re taking it out on your kids. Did I get all that YTA", "YTA.\nPart of being a parent is that we still have to be parents when we don't sleep well and have headaches.\n\nYour daughter is not Josh's parent, YOU are. The only person you should have considered passing your parenting responsibilities off to is Josh's father", "YTA sorry. Your daughter wanted to go to her brothers first birthday party and she missed it for an \u201cactivity\u201d. Parents have to push through to make it work for their kids. You should\u2019ve popped an Advil and pushed through.", "YTA and you have to know it.  Stop joshing yourself.", "Absolutely YTA.  Molly is not the parent: you are. It's your job to suck it up and make sure your son can do his actions.  I *might* understand if you had an actual emergency,  business your reasonable options were to deal with it or have your son miss it. You're basic saying that tour son's needs and wants take precedence over your daughter's.", "YTA, you shirked your responsibility onto your daughter and forced her to choose between her siblings. That little 1 year old is her sibling too. You emotionally manipulated her because you had a headache. You owe your daughter a big apology.", "YTA: Your son is YOUR responsibility not your daughters! You totally played a guilt trip on your daughter. Get off your lazy a$$ and be a parent! A headache is no f'ing excuse. I had cancer and still manage to parent my own children. I'd be pissed too if I were your daughter, your son and your ex. You totally suck!", "YTA. I'm a single mom who frequently gets migraines. This means that sometimes my daughter misses things, and often I take her places while I am miserable with a migraine.  Those were your two appropriate choices here.", "Yup, YTA. If you're too sick to take your kid to his activity, and everyone else has other plans, then I'm sorry, but he doesn't get to go. And Molly was one of the people who had other plans. Molly's plans are not less important than Josh's plans, and because Josh is a minor, it's your responsibility to obtain supervision for him, not hers. Just because you have the ability to control her and force her to cancel her other plans doesn't mean you're not an asshole for actually doing so. You're parentifying your older child in order to get childcare for your favored younger child, and she is absolutely correct that you were wrong to do so.", "YTA . This was all about forcing your daughter to skip on attending her baby brother\u2019s birthday or letting her other brother down .\n\nYou are toxic person who doesn\u2019t have a problem hurting their kids for the sake of getting back at your ex.\n\nThe dysfunctional dynamics is very obvious . you had an affair 16 years ago although you would like to call it a relationship, that resulted in a baby. Your marriage is over 8 years after , I highly doubt they were a happy 8 years considering that your ex obviously kept the relation with only his biological daughter . I actually feel very sorry for your kids .", "YTA\n\nYou DID force her to take Josh.\n\nI would not be surprised AT ALL that you did it on purpose just so Molly would miss the party.\n\nYou were surprised that Molly sided with Joe?  No, you were not.  You cannot be that clueless.\n\nMolly is not Josh's parent.  You are.", "YTA. I'm hoping for all the children's sakes that this is just rage bait, but just in case it's not let's break this down for you and explain all the ways you are the AH.\n\n>Today, Josh had to be at an activity for several hours and all kids under 18 had to have an adult present\n\nOk, so Molly has a birthday party to go to, and you (or his father) have to take YOUR son to his activity. Looks like everyone has things to do today.\n\n>I didn't sleep well last night and had a headache today so I told Molly that she needed to take Josh because otherwise he couldn't go.  \n>  \n>I didn't have anyone else to ask and ended up telling Molly either she takes Josh or he doesn't go at all. Molly finally agreed to take Josh. I guess Molly called Joe and told him she couldn't come to the kid's birthday party because I \"forced\" her to take Josh to his activity, which was planned out way in advance. \n\nI don't know why you put forced in quotes. You did force your daughter to go with Josh and not to the birthday party. You make it very clear that you aren't taking him, despite it being your responsibility - because he is your child - and that if Molly doesn't she's the one who ruined the event for him (when in actuality you would have been the one to ruin it). While its nice for siblings to step up and help out when necessary, it is not her responsibility to drop her plans, which you had to have known about because there is no universe in which her siblings first birthday party was planned the day of the event, to take your child (not hers) to his event. I have chronic migraines, and you know what I do when I have something I have to do and my head feels like someone is splitting it open with a hammer? Take my prescription and power through. I don't make everyone else drop what they're doing to take over my responsibilities. Drink a redbull and take him yourself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Good parents also teach their children to be there for family and to keep important commitments. A baby's party is not something important.  \n>  \n>Biologically yes, but it's a huge age gap. Molly has nothing in common with that baby.  \nJosh is Joe's child. Just because another man's name is on his birth certificate doesn't make Joe any less of a father to Josh.  \nJosh was also invited to the party. I had to firmly remind him that he had a more important obligation today that would negatively impact his new volunteer group if he didn't attend.\n\nYour comments on family are also something that I can't wrap my head around. So good parents teach their kids to be there for family and to keep \"important\" commitments - why are you picking and choosing which commitments are important? The party was for family AND important to your children, and you stopped them from attending. In your own words not something a good parent would do. It seems Molly wants to have a relationship with that baby. And (plot twist) they do have something in common! Their father! SO maybe stop trying to stop her from having a relationship with her family, because that child is her family. If Josh can be considered Joe's child despite him being the child of your affair partner, I think that Josh's new baby can be considered your children's family. \n\n \n\n>It's not my problem to facilitate a relationship between my kids and my ex's new kid.\n\nFinally - you're right it isn't your problem to facilitate a relationship between your children and their half-sibling. But you also should not purposely hinder the relationship either. Molly and Josh both wanted to go to their siblings 1st birthday party and you refused to let them. Something I find incredibly petty of you both for the harm you are doing to your own children, and the vindictive behavior towards your ex who raised a child you had from an affair for eight years, and according to your comments, continues to treat like his own child. And despite that you can't find it in yourself to be kind towards any of these people and deal with your own shit for a few hours. \n\nIf this is real you need to learn to grow up before your children cut you off.", "YTA!! Doing things for our kids with a lack of sleep and headache is what parenting is all about! It\u2019s not always easy or glamorous, and you making Molly take him definitely comes off on you not wanting to share in her siblings 1st birthday!", "YTA Convenient headaches are convenient.\n\nEdit : Reading OP's comments, so she manipulated both children so they couldn't attend a family event that was important to them.\n\nHorrible, selfish parenting.\n\nIn an attempt to destroy your kids' relationship with their father and sibling, you are going to end up destroying your relationship with your kids.\n\nKarma is funny that way.", "YTA, from the attitude in your post and comments I won\u2019t be surprised when you post \u201cmy daughter moved out & went no contact\u2026I just don\u2019t understand\u201d.", "You\u2019re most likely the a-hole", "Molly isn\u2019t Josh\u2019s parent. You are.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Unless your headache was so bad that you were experiencing dizziness/nausea which made you physically incapable of driving, then there is no excuse. As parents, we still have to do what needs to be done even with headaches/lack of sleep.\n\nI really feel like this was more about trying to damage her relationship with her father and new sibling than anything else. Especially based on the comments you've been making. Just because there is a significant age gap doesn't mean there won't be a sibling bond. That's for your daughter to decide and not you. Clearly, she feels different as she wanted to attend the party, but you forced her to take her other sibling to an even YOU should've taken him to. \n\nIn one comment, you mentioned you don't care about your ex and his new family, but you do about your daughter making the best possible decisions. Which made it seem like her spending time with her father and his family isn't one you'd consider good. That's not cool. If she wants to be part of their lives, then she can because that's HER father and sibling. \n\nHonestly, her brother might remember that she took him to the event. He'll probably also remember that because of that,  she missed the party. The baby won't remember that their sister couldn't make it or why. However, I can tell you, your daughter will forever remember that you forced her to pick between her siblings because you had a \"headache.\"", "YTA", "Sorry but YTA\n\nYou do not have to care about the fact that your ex got remarried and has had another child, but you do have to care about that your child has a new sibling\nThat she is probably very excited about, and you have just made her miss a milestone that she will never have a chance to get back\n\nOk Josh was looking forward to something, but so was Molly right?\nIt\u2019s just that you didn\u2019t care so it wasn\u2019t a priority", "YTA & an even bigger one for having to ask were you wrong.\n\nOh & then I read further to your responses to questions and wow !! \n\nMy personal favorite   \n\n\n>\tMolly has nothing in common with that baby.  \n\n\nOh OP you're a real winner aren't you!", "YTA.\n\nYou come across as very manipulative in this instance. It's unfortunate that you backed your daughter into a corner with guilt. \n\nI read that you're in recovery-good for you! I personally know that's a tough journey. Maybe take this time to reflect and see if some old patterns of behavior are creeping up. This is behavior I have seen in a lot of self focused people. You had many choices available and you chose the one that manipulated and hurt someone you love. Not ideal. \n\nGood luck!", "reading this I say YTA.  reading the comments you left makes me worry about your mental health!", "YTA for all the reasons everyone is telling you.  The fact is you absolutely sound like a person who didn't want Molly to go to her siblings 1st birthday party and actually take a little pleasure from sticking it to your ex.", "YTA   \n\n\nJosh is not Molly's responsibility, he is YOUR responsibility. Funny how...Josh isn't allowed to break a commitment...but you and Molly are required to. Stop making excuses, you are a parent and it is YOUR responsibility to follow YOUR commitments.  If your head hurt so bad, take something for it and stop making excuses. You owe Molly an apology, you DID make her miss something SHE \"looked forward to for a long time\" as well", "Biggest AH I\u2019ve seen on here", "And you suck as a person", "yta", "YTA!!  It was so intentional on your part.", "YTA - At first I was thinking you might not be TA then I kept reading then the icing on the cake were your comments in response to others. You seem to be jealous of the fact that even though Joe raised Josh for years her now has his own son. You sound like you want Molly and Josh\u2019s relationship to be the only one that Molly cares about. You don\u2019t sound like you actually are supportive of her having a relationship with her baby brother. You sound bitter and resentful of Joe and his new relationship even though he clearly stayed longer than most people would\u2019ve with you having an affair and getting knocked up from it.", "You're downplaying the situation even in the way you relay it. It shows in your wording that you didn't care about the party at all. \n\nIt was your kid's siblings' party. Your kid should have been there. I agree you should have sucked it up and handled it. Or at the very least, allowed the Father to know in case he could pick the kid up. Family friends probably came from all directions. I bet there was a ride. I think you just didn't care. It shows that you just didn't care. Pretty messed up.\n\nAlso it's not fair when a parent expects the other kids to handle parent things. It was YOUR responsibility to be sure the kid got to his thing. It was not your other kid's problem to handle. The other one had plans too but you decided they weren't important and that she should handle YOUR responsibility for you instead. I'm betting this kind of thing is a pattern, by the way you word and portray things. This didn't have to be an issue. It's only one because you didn't exhaust all options as you claim you did. She should have been at that party and in the pictures that will be around for years to come. It's where she belonged.", "YTA - you resent a baby because it\u2019s your ex\u2019s kid, and now you want your children to resent that baby as well. You\u2019re selfish, a bad parent, and it\u2019s not surprising you got a divorce. Though it\u2019s baffling it didn\u2019t happen sooner.", "YTA. Take some meds and be a parent to your son. You DID force Molly to miss the party by having her choose between Josh not attending his event or her not attending her event. You have a kind and selfless daughter. You had a headache so you couldn\u2019t do your responsibility as a mom? WTF. Last night I got 4 hours of non-consecutive sleep because both my kids had a really hard night. You know what i did with my tiredness, headache, backache and short fuse today? I stretched and took a hot shower, took ibuprofen and drank a butt-load of coffee and spent all day BEING A RESPONSIBLE MOTHER. Ugh.", "YTA please stop giving birth to kids you can't take care of wtf", "YTA-- Josh is not Molly's responsibility. He's yours. You can ask Molly if she's willing, but instead you guilt tripped her into it and made her miss another event that was also planned in advance. \n\nYou should've taken an advil and gone, or Josh should've missed it. \n\nYou turned your problem, and Josh's problem, into Molly's problem and you didn't give her a choice.", "YTA and I knew that half way through reading this. Your comments just solidified that. \n\nJosh didn\u2019t even want to go to this event that you made Molly take him to. He wanted to attend the baby\u2019s birthday party with his sister. But you decided that HE made a commitment to go to this activity and conveniently forgot about the commitments that YOU and your daughter also made. You made a commitment to your son to take him, and Molly made a commitment to go to her siblings party. You could have just as easily allowed your son and daughter to go to the party but you had to be petty and make your daughter miss her siblings first birthday. \n\nA lot of people barely get sleep and wake up with headaches and still do the things they are supposed to. You found a convenient way to stick it to your ex and in the process hurt both of your children. Way to go! Hope you\u2019re proud of yourself. It\u2019s behavior like this that causes children to go no contact with parents by the way. You used your son to force your daughter to miss the birthday, luckily she blames you and not her brother.", "YTA.", "YTA", "YTA you should\u2019ve sucked up your little \u201cheadache.\u201d We all know you\u2019re jealous he moved on & has another kid.", "That\u2019s her sibling. The fact you don\u2019t understand how that would make her upset makes YTA. Yes, she also took her brother to an activity but in doing so you made her miss out on time with a baby sibling that she likely does not get to see very often.", "YTA huge huge AH\n\nYou bailed on your responsibility as a parent and forced your daughter to do it because you had a \u201cheadache\u201d.

Molly had plans already. You forced your daughter to cancel her existing plans to prioritise her brother\u2019s plans because you had a headache.", "YTA. That shouldn\u2019t even be a question. How do you not see a problem with your actions?", "YTA. You are a cartoon villain with a handlebar mustache.", "YTA", "YTA - you could have dealt with your headache in any number of ways and still made the event happen for Josh.  Even migraines can be handled in the matter of a hour or so if you have the proper treatment (chronic migraine sufferer here).

You put Molly on the spot and whether you did it out of spite or subconsciously, you deliberately blocked her from participating in something that was important to her.", "YTA.

Shame on you.", "Yta wow, crappy mom award goes to you. You\u2019re a parent it\u2019s your job to take care of your child . You should have sucked it up take some d**m pills and take him to where he needed to be.", "YTA. You gave some very weak excuses. As a parent I can\u2019t imagine using \u201cI have a headache\u201d to my kid to bail on something I had committed to, unless it was a massive migraine that wasn\u2019t responding to strong meds (which you didn\u2019t say). Being tired from traveling is also a weak excuse, unless the grandparents are elderly and in poor health. You also didn\u2019t mention asking another parent to take him - did he not know any other kids who were participating in this event and whose parent could also cover for you?\n\nMolly seems to be onto something. I wonder if your headache was jealousy.", "Info: do you always pretend to be sick to manipulate your kids or just when it involves your ex-husband?", "YTA.\n\nYou owe your daughter AND your ex an apology.", "YTA. Don\u2019t pawn your responsibilities off on a teenager.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA\nWhy is your daughter responsible for your other child? If he missed the event bc you were sick, so be it.

It obvious that you don't want her to have a relationship with the baby as you're jealous of them.", "YTA. So you had an headache and didn\u2019t sleep well. Suck it up with some painkillers (I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have mentioned if the headache had been debilitating). But no, Molly had to miss the party that you find unimportant.", "Seems another person came for judgement but then argues when it doesn\u2019t go their way. YTA. It sounds like you were unreasonable and unwilling to try to do what your kid wanted. What\u2019s the real motivation here?", "YTA. Josh is not Molly\u2019s responsibility. Your responsibility as a parent is to do what you need to do to support your children, headache or not. Take some ibuprofen and push through.", "You pressured one child be the legal adult for another child against their will?\n\nYTA. \n\nYou basically made Josh\u2019s event priority over an event Molly wanted", "YTA OP\n\nYou made your daughter be a parent to your child Josh. Molly and Joe are 100% correct Josh is not Molly's responsibility. Josh is YOUR responsibility period, stop pawning your child Josh onto Molly. Because again Molly is NOT josh's responsibility. You are responsible for Josh.\n\nYou made Molly miss the younger siblings celebration. A celebration she wanted to go to yet you backed her into a corner and made her choose.\n\nThere were other alternatives that you could have used instead of Molly.

You take something for your headache and you keep being a parent.", "YTA. You forced Molly to miss out on her event so Josh didn\u2019t have to miss out on his. You\u2019ve showed everyone where your priorities are (and also your vindictiveness). Stop lying to yourself. You know you were being an AH.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is NOT required to be the \"Adult\" for her half-sibling.  Haranguing and guilting her into is is AH behavior.\n\nAlso yes, since you describe this as a \"headache\", I'm going with take an Advil and suck it up TOO.  That is what being a parent is about.\n\nOh lord, after reading your comments you are a IRREDEEMABLE asshole.  \nYou kept JOSH from going to party, you kept Molly from going to party.

I also have Josh, 16m from another relationship (long story.) Joe and I divorced 8 years ago. Joe is remarried and has a kid with his new wife, that kid just turned 1.\n\nToday, Josh had to be at an activity for several hours and all kids under 18 had to have an adult present. I didn't sleep well last night and had a headache today so I told Molly that she needed to take Jess because otherwise Josh couldn't go. Molly initially refused and told me to ask her grandparents (my parents) but they just returned from a trip out of state and are tired from traveling. I didn't have anyone else to ask and ended up telling Molly either she takes Josh or he doesn't go at all. Molly finally agreed to take Josh. I guess Molly called Joe and told him she couldn't come to the kid's birthday party because I \"forced\" her to take Josh to his activity, which was planned out way in advance. Joe called and went off on me for \"making\" Molly miss the party, that I was being manipulative and should have taken an advil, sucked it up and took Josh or found anyone else to take him. I tried explaining to Joe that I had a headache and it was too last minute to find anyone else so Molly was my only option, if she didn't do it, Josh would have to miss out on something he's been looking forward to for a long time. Joe had some more choice words for me and hung up. Later when I told Molly her dad was unreasonably upset over her missing a baby's party, Molly actually sided with Joe and that surprised me. Now I'm wondering if maybe I was in the wrong?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Thank goodness your ex-husband is finally in a happy marriage.  He deserves it.", "Except he had the audacity to celebrate his own childs birthday. Which narc mommy sabotaged.\nJosh needs to take his bio kids and get out.", "\u201cChoice.\u201d You put poor Josh in the middle, forcing Molly to choose between protecting him from your petty games and sharing an important day with her dad and his family.", "Hopefully her future choices are to not see you. That would be best for her", "And like I said, she should have told you no.", "She told you no. You DID force her to go. That wasn\u2019t her choice. Take an Advil and be a freaking parent. YTA", "The ONLY reason Molly made that choice is because you said if she didn't take Josh, he couldn't go. And the only reason Josh was going to the activity instead of his sibling's party was because you told him that NOT going wasn't an option. You're really big on other people keeping to commitments, but you suck at doing it yourself.", "Yeah, because you guilt-tripped her!", "What lifestyle?", "So he wouldn\u2019t spend enough money on you?  \n\nSo where is the anger at Joe coming from?", "It\u2019s okay. You can call it a drug addiction. You don\u2019t have to pretty it up for us.", "So how\u2019s that lifestyle looking for you now?", "She did say that the birthday party was planned way before SHE SIGNED HIM UP for the activity, so I'm going all in.", "Or maybe she was raped.", "Molly could have refused to take Josh and attended the party if it meant that much to her. Instead she chose to be there for her brother today.", "Or it.", "Or \u201cthe kid\u201d", "I don't see how the gender of the baby is relevant.", "He actually wanted to go, but OP made him go to a team building group for homeschool kids. Once again, she prevented her kid from going to the party. Joe seems to be including him since OP didn't say he wasn't invited & only mentioned that she told him he'd committed to the group & couldn't go.", "No she wouldn't let Josh go", "Josh was also invited to the party. I had to firmly remind him that he had a more important obligation today that would negatively impact his new volunteer group if he didn't attend.", "Given she complained in another comment about her husband not keeping her in the manner she desired to become accustomed to, I\u2019m betting she\u2019s butthurt that he\u2019s spending money with his new wife. \n\nI mean how dare he move on to a supportive relationship and not someone who leeches off him, can\u2019t we all see how unfair it is on her that he didn\u2019t spend all his money on her most deserving self? /s", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Joe and OP divorced 8 years ago, but Josh is 16 and not Joe's child.", "Joe made very good money over $350k annually with bonuses. But he's cheap. He'd rather us live in an older 3 bedroom ranch than a nice subdivision. He could have afforded the best for his family if he'd wanted to.", "Molly told you no, but you kept asking it sounds like. You said she finally agreed which meant you kept asking.", "As I've said twice before...she should have refused.  And again...as I've noted numerous times, the baby is her brother.  You are just so determined to deny that...it's fascinating to watch just how you try to skirt that.", "She did refuse, when she asked you for other alternatives. You refused to work with her, and instead made her think there was no other option when there absolutely was. I bet your parents would've said yes if you...ya know...actually asked instead of assumed", "You kept pushing & guilting her with saying you had a headache & didn't sleep well. You absolutely made sure neither kid could go because you want them to have a wedge between them. Stop lying because both of your kids know what you're doing.", "You\u2019re gaslighting.  In the purest sense of the word.  You know you made it impossible for her to refuse, and now you\u2019re telling us (and likely her) that her refusal was always an option.  You\u2019re really gross.", "So, how many times would Molly have had to say no to you before you would have accepted that as the answer? She didn't \"choose\" anything, you coerced her.", "You didn\u2019t let her say no. You guilted her. You would guilt her forever if she stuck to her guns and make a point to her sibling to blame it on her.", "\u2026she refused", "Because you threatened her with her brother\u2019s happiness/activity.", "No, she didn't choose, you emotionally blackmailed and guilt triped her into taking your son, it would be stupid of you to think such a pity technic will work on her forever, one day she will hit her breaking point, she's gonna wake up and realize you're a toxic person in her life and she'll go very low contact with you if any at all, and it would be totally your fault.", "\" I told Molly either she takes josh or she doesn't go at all\" do you know what a choice is? Becaise this sounds like an ultimatum. YTA", "No she did not choose to be there for her brother today. Instead you FORCED HER HAND. Which is extra shitty because you're the parent not Molly. We all get headaches, and we do what we need to do to honor our commitments.  We all have problems sleeping sometimes and yet we still honor our commitments.  Yta for sure.", "Narcissist", "because you were standing there and her face basically telling her that if she didn\u2019t pick her brother then she was saying that he wasn\u2019t important and because that is her little brother that she grew up with she would never do that because she is 1000 times the person you are and will ever be", "Because you guilted her.", "She tried, and you had a fit. YTA", "You manipulated her into missing it to take Josh. The baby won't remember it, but she will. And she's old enough now that this could be one of the final nails in the coffin of how your relationship progresses in her adult life.", "She has 2 brothers FYI", "It\u2019s relevant that Molly said no to you but that doesn\u2019t seem like it mattered either.", "Because the baby is your daughter\u2019s *family*.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s relevant.\n\nAnd you seem to be *pretending* to misunderstand because you don\u2019t want to acknowledge that the baby is Molly\u2019s sibling, her family.", "Because your child's sibling is a person, a person with a real relationship to your daughter. And just like Molly and Josh get to have names and genders and relationships in your story, so does their sibling. The fact that you refuse to acknowledge that makes clear that you're trying to distance your daughter from her sibling.", "Then say \"Molly's sibling\" or \"Molly's half sibling\" if you're so determined not to say the gender.", "MOLLY TOLD YOU NO", "And yet you told Molly it was something Josh had been looking forward to. More lies. More manipulation. She should have taken Josh to the party instead since you don\u2019t care enough to drive him.", "So you forced BOTH kids to miss a family event they wanted to attend, but still don't see how what you're doing is interfering with their relationship with your ex and their sibling...", "Josh and Molly both wanted to go to their brother's birthday party and you forced both of them not to attend.  YTA really doesn't begin to cover it.", "Oh I see so it is not a coincidence at all. Instead of everyone happily going to the party you intentionally forced this \"more important obligation\" and then conveniently took away both Molly and Josh's opportunity to meet family, which is absolutely much more important! How can a volunteer group be more important than family? If you tell me this is all an accident I do not believe you.\n\nThe only thing Molly did wrong was to take your BS and not just take Josh over to where they should be going in the first place.", "*Firmly* *remind* him\u2026meaning he wanted to go too and you said no.", "It couldn\u2019t have been that important if you couldn\u2019t take him due to a simple headache. \n\nYTA.", "so you are forcing your children to alienate them new sibling what is wrong with you genuinely??", "So you force your son to attend an activity he didn't want to attend when you were the one who signed him up for it in the first place, then you forced your daughter to take him to it and be his babysitter for the day.\n\nYou just keep making excuses that doesn't make any sense, you say you have no problem with them going to that party but you force both of them not to go, you say he wanted to go to both the party and the activity but from your answers it was clear he DIDN'T  want to go to that activity, at the very least the party was a priority for him, but you forced him to go when you couldn't even take him, you say he made a commitment when you were the one who made the commitment for him, you say your daughter chose to take him but you didn't even give her a choice in the matter, you say your ex is your son's dad and blood doesn't matter, but when he have a baby you can't even call them a sibling, you say you want your son to honor his commitment but you had no problem cheating on your ex just because of a hard time in your relationship, and even now after so many years you refuse to acknowledge the fact that you broke your commitment (marriage vows) which is way more important than a simple activity, you still refuse to say that you cheated and say that you accidentally got pregnant by someone else, it's like the only problem with this in your eyes was getting pregnant, why so stressed about others fulfilling meaningless commitments when you can't even keep your legs closed? Why do you refuse to acknowledge your mistakes? Why being a hypocrite?\n\nI said it before and I'll say it again, if you really belive the excuses you make, then you're down right delusional, and you may as well get some therapy for your narcissism before your kids cut you out of their life as they should, because you're only going to make them miserable.", "Don't get why you came here to ask that. \n\nYou are clearly TA but argue every comment stating as much. \n\nVery delusional if you are that low on self-awareness.", "Oh so even josh didn\u2019t care about this event and wanted to be at the party. Your ex is 1000% right about you and your kids will see it soon enough.", "So your son wanted to celebrate his new sibling and you guilted him out of going, then guilted Molly out of going and effectively erased two siblings out of a milestone birthday. Nothing you say here makes you sound like a good parent or person.", "Ohhhh, a gold digger... who could not dig enough gold.\n\nIt all makes much more sense now.", "Josh's dad couldnt keep up with the narc addict lifestyle.", "We did not divorce because of Josh. I never said that. We divorced when Josh was 8.", "So you're a gold digger who wanted him to support you so you could go out and have more affair babies? Why didn't Josh's father take him to his thing?", "So, he stood by you through your addiction & even put his name on another man's child (that you became pregnant by *during* your marriage), but he was suddenly a bad partner because he didn't want to move you into a big, nice house in a fancy subdivision? Yeah, you're a major AH & really showing yourself in these comments.", "So basically you were lazy to contribute to the family and was too busy getting high? \n\nYou\u2019re lazy and a crap parent.0", "And what did you contribute towards buying a house in a nice subdivision?", "\u2026.so you\u2019re a gold digger and a ho. Got it.", "I read that as she forced her hand...", "What\u2019s really crazy is that Josh is 16. Old enough to work and drive. You can tell she didn\u2019t want neither of them to go due to bitterness. She didn\u2019t want to ask the grandparents, hell we live in the age of Uber/Lyft but yet this was the only event that needed a parent or at least someone 18 to be there constantly?", "Right? That would have been boss, but OP is probably pretty scary when she gets mad.", "Josh had been looking forward to both. It was unfortunate they happened on the same day.", "She dug herself right out of that marriage. And is seemingly now single, and I suspect the lifestyle that wasn\u2019t good enough for her is a lot better than what she\u2019s got now.", "You probably divorced cause you did nothing of value to contribute to the household and expected your ex to father and provide for another man\u2019s kid.", "So he found out Josh wasn\u2019t his, by any chance?", "To be fair, she might not know who josh\u2019s father is, she might have been too high.", "Hey, drugs aren\u2019t cheap!! She had to fund her drug addiction. Oops, sorry, her *pill* *problem*."]}
