We split up before he was born, and to be honest I\u2019m not very involved with the parenting besides being generous with child support and occasionally having Mark over.\n\nI have a chronic and terminal condition that recently landed me in hospital. I had a really horrible flair up and had to be admitted to ICU. To make it worse, it happened during the time I was supposed to have Mark over. I was unconscious and on life support and so I couldn\u2019t answer Kate\u2019s calls.\n\nWhen I woke up, I checked my phone and saw all the missed calls and messages. Kate was very upset as I basically ghosted her, and she sent a lot of rude and judgemental messages. So I snapped a pic of me in the hospital bed with all the tubes attached and sent it to her with the caption \u201csorry was busy trying not to die\u201d.\n\nKate obviously freaked out and apologised, and I, being high on meds, told her that \u201cit\u2019s okay just a normal day having X\u201d.\n\nTurns out Kate didn\u2019t know about my condition. We didn\u2019t really have a relationship, she was just a girl from my school whom I hooked up with and it didn\u2019t end very well. And we don\u2019t have much contact aside from Mark-related stuff. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t tell her, probably forgot or something.\n\nObviously it made her freak out even more. Kate called me and started crying and yelling at the same time, basically having a breakdown over the phone. She said I should\u2019ve been upfront with her about it back then, that it\u2019s my fault if Mark ever gets sick (it\u2019s not a genetic neither a transmittable condition so he\u2019s okay btw). She also said it\u2019s unfair that we made a baby who will lose his dad at a young age, and this is where I might have been TA. I said \u201cyou know what would be more unfair? Fucking dying before my only son graduates high school.\u201d\n\nIt upset her even more and she said that I\u2019m the asshole for making her and Mark go through this. I said it\u2019s not my fault, she said it is because if I was upfront with her, she wouldn\u2019t have hooked up with me. I told her it\u2019s too late and she called me an ah, hung up and told everyone I was an AH to her.", "created_utc": 1701038434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184n60w/aita_for_telling_my_bm_that_ill_die_before_our/", "score": 916, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What if, a few years from now, you die, and your son and Kate had no idea this was a possibility? You should have told her. Not for her sake but for your SON'S sake.\n\nEdit: And a thought just struck me, what if you had died in the hospital and your son hadn't had the chance to say goodbye? Can you imagine what that would have done to him?", "You were under no obligation to share your medical history prior to hooking up, but YTA for not disclosing it when the two of you share a child who will be affected when you die.", "soft YTA\n\nAnd god damn, I can't believe I'm having to say that to someone who is dying.  I'm sorry that life dealt you that hand.\n\nNone of her business on a hookup.  However, you should have disclosed the second she told you about the pregnancy that you had a medical condition that meant she's facing bringing a child into the world that will have to deal with that. By not speaking up, you wronged both her and Mark. \n\nWhile she could have reacted better, the way you dropped it on her wasn't exactly gentle.  She's obviously feeling upset over how this will hurt Mark, because it will.  And she had an emotional meltdown in the heat of the moment.  You're drugged and going through shit, too.  I get that.

This would be like Kate having the baby without telling you she was being pregnant and upon sending you a pic of the kid saying \u201cturns out he didn\u2019t know I was pregnant\u201d.\n\nYou should have mentioned what the condition is, or at least something vague. As it is we don\u2019t know how much it would affect you caring for the child or exactly how important this info would have been to share with an expectant mother.\n\nAs it is it seems pretty relevant to maybe let her know before giving birth that you won\u2019t be financially, emotionally or physically supporting the child because you\u2019re terminally ill?\n\nI\u2019m guessing this is just made up between the missing info and the bizarre information withholding.", "YTA. I agree with everyone else that you should have told her when you found out she was pregnant, so she'd be able to decide whether she wanted to raise a child with someone with a terminal illness. But also, YTA for having a 4-year-old visit you unsupervised when you know you have a condition that can cause you at any time to need to be suddenly hospitalized. What if that happened when Mark was with you? It's irresponsible and neglectful to take on caregiving responsibilities when you can't trust your body not to suddenly give out and leave the child unsupervised.", "I just want to know how you think she should have reacted having something like that suddenly revealed to her?", "As someone with a medical condition I forget about until it's a problem, I wanted to weigh in here.\n\nWhen these kinds of things are just part of your life that you don't think about and are as natural to you as breathing, it's understandable that you're not going to tell every single person you meet or hook up with that you have said condition. \n\nFrom your post, it sounds like you and Kate were a short-term thing that neither of you intended to be more than a teen romance. Therefore, not telling her about your condition is perfectly find and understandable. You weren't intending to have kids with her, so why would you have told her?\n\nBut when you did have a kid, that's where it becomes a bit of an asshole move to not say anything. Even if you're not in the kid's life, and it's not genetic/transferable, the fact you have a medical condition that will impact his life is important to share. If nothing else, then because you're a part of his life, and if you could potentially one day drop down dead, think of how that's going to affect your kid. If he doesn't know that daddy gets sick some times, it's gonna be a massive shock and trauma, compared to if he knew that dad has a medical condition that may mean he's not around for the future.\n\nYour ex also should have been made aware because of situations exactly like this. I understand sometimes forgetting your condition because it's just a part of your life, but you're also aware you have it, and that it is terminal. It's not like you had a stroke or heart attack unexpectedly. You knew this was a consequence of your condition. She deserves to know that there may be times where this exact situation may happen: it's your turn with the child, but you have a medical emergency and can't take him. \n\nAlso, consider this. What if you'd had your child, and this had happened? If you'd had an episode that required hospitalisation. How would you have dealt with that? How would your son have reacted, seeing his dad like that? What kind of trauma could you have inflicted, had you collapsed in front of him, needed an ambulance, no one is explaining to him what's going on, what happened to daddy, if he's going to be ok, and who's going to take care of him in the meantime. \n\nI'm going to have to go with YTA, and you've been very irresponsible. I know it's hard when this is just your life, and you fear you won't see your child grow up, but you should have told her so that you could work together to try and ensure your condition has as little horrible impact on your son as possible.\n\nAnd please don't give up hope. My cousin had a degenerative disease diagnosed at 25 and told she would only live to 35. She died a month after her 60th birthday, having seen her children grow up, graduate school, go to university, start their own businesses and meet their girlfriends. Medical advances can occur very quickly, and research is always ongoing. I hope you are able to have far more years than you're currently expecting, and get to see all those important milestones.", "YOU are the one with a terminal condition that it sounds like you knew you would lose your battle to young, so it\u2019s YOUR responsibility to either practice safe sex or disclose this information to someone who will potentially be having to deal with a child who has been traumatized by the death of a parent  and will also end up being the one to raise said child alone.", "You're barely in your son's life but you somehow care about dying before he graduates high school? Kate's the one who's actually giving up her life to raise him and you kept information that could impact him away from her.", "YTA \n\n\\-\"generous with child support\" what does that mean? Its the bare minimum. Unless you are coughing up 3x what is necessary you are not generous. \n\n\\-you should have told her about your condition the minute she showed positive on a pregnancy test. It is very much her business whether or not her unborn-son would 1. inherit any illnesses from you. Family medical history is important, *chronic or not*. 2. lose his father earlier than most. Stuff like that really matters both emotionally and financially, for both her and Mark. \n\nThe only things you are not an AH about in this post is: going to the ICU without telling her, and having a chronic disease. Apologize to her and you really should be talking to Mark in the future WITH Kate there, about you dying.", "She does sound a bit self centred but holy fuck you didn't even bother to inform the mother of your child that you're terminally ill? YTA", "YTA. \n\n1. You didn\u2019t tell the mother of your child you had a serious condition.

She had no idea you were in the hospital so she reasonably assumed you were ignoring her and shirking your responsibilities to your son. A pic of you in the hospital captioned \u201ctrying not to die\u201d is a really cruel way to fill someone in on information you deliberately withheld. \n\n3. She was expressing valid concerns about your son and you made another AH comment. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re sick and your lifespan may be cut short, but you were in the wrong here.", "Of course YTA and you know it. The fact that she blew up on you suggests this is absolutely not the first time you ghosted her and if it's so bad you're going to die in the next decade or whatever she ABSOLUTELY should've been told when it was clear you were going to have this baby together.", "ESH\n\nI think you should have told Kate about your condition if only so you have a plan for if you were ever taken ill while caring for your son and to prepare herself for telling Mark if the worst happens.\n\nIt's pretty clear neither of you planned on having a child and maybe Kate's anger is a reaction to the shock of your diagnosis, but the comment about making a baby whose father will die when he's young seems like she's thinking if she'd known she'd have had an abortion.  I think that might be a big part of what she's angry about.", "E S H for no condom and bc on her side (edit: okay I'm wrong to assume that, sorry!)\n\n YTA  If you knew you were sick with this, when she got pregnant, that is when you should have told her. it might have changed her decision on having the baby\n\nYTA for saying child support is 'generous' as if you deserve kudos for supporting a being you recklessly helped bring into the world", "Hey siri, file this under \u2018things that didn\u2019t happen\u2019.", "YTA.

Kate, obviously, for making your terminal illness all about her.

You absolutely had the obligation of providing this information.", "ESH \nYou are an absent father and withheld extremely important information that may or may not have affected her decision to keep the baby AND continued to keep that information from them.  \nShe did not respond well but made it about her.", "YTA. This is information you should have communicated much, much earlier.

And the fact that your kid doesn\u2019t even know now to make the most of your time left is super heartbreaking.\n\nKinda tells me enough that you wanted a kid as a legacy/lineage thing and impregnated someone on purpose, knowing you were gonna die. That\u2019s super fucked up and manipulative.", "So she thinks you're the villain for \"making her and your kid go through this\"? ESH, because even though she's freaking out and being a bit irrational now, the idea that you somehow forgot to mention your terminal condition to the mother of your child at some point in the past 4 years of co-parenting is hard to swallow.", "NAH\n\nYou both have a lot on your plate to deal with.

Kate was very upset as I basically ghosted her, and she sent a lot of rude and judgemental messages. So I snapped a pic of me in the hospital bed with all the tubes attached and sent it to her with the caption \u201csorry was busy trying not to die\u201d.\n\nKate obviously freaked out and apologised, and I, being high on meds, told her that \u201cit\u2019s okay just a normal day having X\u201d.\n\nTurns out Kate didn\u2019t know about my condition. We didn\u2019t really have a relationship, she was just a girl from my school whom I hooked up with and it didn\u2019t end very well. And we don\u2019t have much contact aside from Mark-related stuff. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t tell her, probably forgot or something.\n\nObviously it made her freak out even more. Kate called me and started crying and yelling at the same time, basically having a breakdown over the phone. She said I should\u2019ve been upfront with her about it back then, that it\u2019s my fault if Mark ever gets sick (it\u2019s not a genetic neither a transmittable condition so he\u2019s okay btw). She also said it\u2019s unfair that we made a baby who will lose his dad at a young age, and this is where I might have been TA. I said \u201cyou know what would be more unfair? Fucking dying before my only son graduates high school.\u201d\n\nIt upset her even more and she said that I\u2019m the asshole for making her and Mark go through this. I said it\u2019s not my fault, she said it is because if I was upfront with her, she wouldn\u2019t have hooked up with me. I told her it\u2019s too late and she called me an ah, hung up and told everyone I was an AH to her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
