{"id": 29564, "submission_id": "17f46fq", "title": "AITA for telling my uncle to stop \"gifting\" my daughter extravagant trips", "selftext": "So, a little backstory. When my sisters and I were kids, every year for our birthdays and Christmas my uncle would give us cards. Inside those cards would be a printed out picture of some place (i.e. local theme parks, the zoo, aquarium, museums, any place a kid would love to go). After we opened them, he would tell us that we're going to that place. He would say things like \"it's gonna be the best trip of your life!\" That would obviously make us very excited. Here's the thing. We never went on any of those trips. We never went to any of those places. \n\nAs a young kid, it would be disappointing. But after a while I started expecting it and just going along with it. I don't hold any animosity towards him at all obviously. As an adult now, I understand he did that because he didn't have the means to buy us gifts. \n\nHere's where I'm starting to have a little bit of an issue with it. My daughter's fifth birthday was last week. My uncle gave her a card, she opened it to find a printed out picture of a theme park about two hours away from our house. And he promised her a fun weekend away. He promised her things like a giant hotel room with a swimming pool, all the snacks she could ever want, and tickets to every show she wants to see at the park. She was over the moon. For the past week, my daughter has talked non-stop about this trip. She keeps telling me how excited she is and how excited her whole class at school is for her. It breaks my heart to look at that smile on her face knowing it's not gonna happen. I remember how disappointing it was for me, and I don't want her to go through that. \n\nSo. I texted my uncle. Here's what the message said, \"Hi! Your message in \\[daughter's name\\] card was so beautiful. Do you think next time you could leave out the promise of an extravagant trip? The thought and gesture is amazing. However, I never know what to say when she asks me when this trip will be. She absolutely loves spending time with you so I know the promise of even a nice lunch together would make her so happy.\"\n\nHe never responded, but my aunt told me he was upset. She said something like he was offended that I implied the only thing he could afford was a \"nice lunch.\" I didn't mean it like that at all. I just wanted him to understand that she loves him and wants to spend time with him and he doesn't need to promise impossible things to make that happen. But I can see why he interpreted it the way he did. And that's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. This has been an unspoken thing in my family for so many years so I'm now wondering if I should've just kept it that way. I just can't stand the thought of my little girl getting disappointed so many times. My sisters and my mom agree with me. My mom even said she wished she stopped it when we were kids.

There is zero need for it.", "NTA. \n\nStop being nice because he\u2019s not being nice. He knowingly is getting a child\u2019s hope up and then crushing it. There isn\u2019t one nice thing about what he\u2019s doing. \n\nTell him he\u2019s no longer allowed to give gifts because he\u2019s a known liar, and that all attempts will be intercepted by you.", "NTA, but why are you being sensitive to his feelings when he wasn't sensitive to yours when you were a child? Tell him that his actions caused you repeated disappointment when he didn't follow through on his promises and that you don't want your child to experience the same. IOUs are not presents. As you say, a lunch or an activity on the day would be lovely, but other than that, stick to an actual gift or give nothing at all.", "NTA and I would definitely protect your daughter. Because that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing. The disappointment for everyone when it doesn\u2019t happen is so harsh for a child. It\u2019s not a life lesson she needs to learn. Too bad he\u2019s upset about your implication. Your daughter comes first. He\u2019s making empty promises and setting her up to not believe or trust when someone gives her something exciting. You already went through that and no how it feels. She doesn\u2019t deserve that also.", "NTA. He is absolutely in the wrong. He lied to you when you were a child, and he is lying to your daughter now. You stomp that behaviour, HARD. The adults in your daughter's life will KEEP their promises to her, or you'll know the reason why.\n\nDude is offended because he knows he's lying and getting a little girl's hopes up, only to duck out before they realize it was nothing but vapourware.", "NTA The kindest interpretation I can make is that your uncle has fully deluded himself for years that the children he's giving these \"gifts\" to are actually getting something positive out of it.\n\nRegardless, the disappointment you felt as a child is the reality of his \"gifts\" and that is always what will come of them. Any idea he might have that the child is given a wonderful dream and is satisfied with that is pure delusion -- and this is me assuming no malice on his part. He doesn't need to have any in order to be hurting children's feelings with his behavior. The behavior does that regardless of his intentions. \n\nI think it's high time this is spelled out to him clearly. He has no room to be offended here and is only able to feel that way because he is so deluded. \n\nThe bottom line is that while his feelings will be the ones being hurt for once hopefully an end will finally be put to him hurting the feelings of the children in your family, as should have happened years ago when he first started doing this.\n\nETA: The unspoken rule in your family is to sacrifice the children for your uncle's sake. This has always been wrong thinking. The innocent children should not have to repeatedly suffer disappointment just so your uncle doesn't have to feel sad the one time he is told what his actions are actually doing to the children.", "People who gaslight others usually get offended when they're called out. Even in the kindest manner. Because this exposes their lie, and how dare you do that!! How dare you think your feelings or the little 5-year-old's feelings are as important as his? Tut, tut!! I only wish I'd stood up for my kids in similar situations! NTA", "NTA\n\nYour uncles intentions might be good, but doing this to a small child is just cruel. And your uncle playing a victim of hurt feelings, GOOD! He deserves some hurt feelings for his broken promises in order to boost his ego. \n\nThere's zero wrong in affording to gift just a lunch. But there's a lot wrong in using children's birthdays as an ego boost and making yourself look wealthy at the expense of small children.", "NTA! \n\nYour uncle is being cruel to another generation.\n\n\u201cI know you feel offended by what I said, but you are being cruel to my daughter by promising a trip that will never materialise. You did exactly the same thing to me and my sisters when we were children, so I know for a fact how much it hurts to have these grand promises made but never seen through, and I will not allow you to hurt my daughter in the same way. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a lack or time, finances or another reason, it is unacceptable to make a child feel this way. \n\nYou know my daughter loves spending time with you, she would have been so happy with a trip to the local park and ice cream - spending TIME with you, instead now I will have to deal with a little girls broken heart (like mine was many times). \n\nPlease think about the consequences of your actions, just because you don\u2019t witness them doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t happen.\u201d", "NTA and he's a massive one for doing that. Maybe he'll be upset for a while, but at least he won't likely do it  again. Mind you, the next time he sends a card for your child, open it first and check to make sure he hasn't done it again.", "NTA\n\nsomething is wrong with your uncle. Even if he had good intentions, he should know that it\u2019s wrong to lie. In this instance, it\u2019s completely unnecessary. And you know, it does sound like \u201ca nice lunch\u201d is all he can afford. Not your fault he can\u2019t face reality, and is offended by it.", "NTA. Good for you to stand up for your child in a way your mother couldn\u2019t bring herself to do. That would be a heartbreaking experience for any kid. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d pre-open any cards from him and confiscate them if needed, even if that needs to be done in his presence.", "NTA. It\u2019s cruel and sick for him to do that.", "NTA for one very simple reason, when a child is consistently lied to by an adult they love and trust/should be able to trust, they often have trust issues as adults. Either that or they accept being lied to in relationships as normal, neither outcome is one you want for your child. \n\nYou are not only saving your daughter disappointment in the here and now, you are likely saving her from having difficulty with relationships in her future.\n\nAlso if anyone in your family has issue with you simply ask them who feelings should you work towards not hurting? A child or a grown ass man?", "NTA.  At all.  What he does is cruel and he should be called out on it.  He needs to know that your daughter has told her entire class about this trip and everyone is excited for her.   Why you\u2019re worried about his feelings is beyond me.  \n\nI would absolutely tell him if he doesn\u2019t follow through with this trip, he isn\u2019t allowed to make anymore unfulfilled promises.   Screw his feelings.  Be angry.   Protect your kid.", "NTA\n\nYou know what I'd do. I think I'd apply a little malicious compliance. I'd start calling him every day and ask him when the trip is. \n\nLet's schedule it. Niece is so excited and has told everyone how her awesome uncle is taking her to \"expensive park\". Let's set it up! Is Saturday good for you. You certainly will follow through right? You're not lying to a five year old right?\n\nMake him feel as guilty as possible for crushing her dreams\n Then if you possibly can - you take her.", "NTA. You should have stopped it before he gave her the lying card.", "My grandparents used to do this albeit in a different way.  Every year they asked me what I wanted for my birthday or Christmas. I would get excited give them my list (prices of items being reasonable, don't want to burden them) just to receive some random thing that I never wanted or asked for.  For years they did this, and I never understood why.\n\nIt wasn't even about the gifts but rather the fact that they made me excited just to disappoint me.  I mean I would have been fine if they did not ask at all, and I get whatever they give me if they wanted to.\n\nThis happened for years, and I asked my mother about it, she just told me to accept it.\n\nOne year I completely lost my cool. My grandmother as per usual phones me and ask me to tell her what I wanted. I told her why bother? because you guys are just going to disappoint me again.  I unleased the fury from hell from both my grandparents and my parents.  My grandmother cried told my grandfather he called my dad.  I got blasted from all sides.\n\n\" Why are you being so cruel with your grandparents? \" What the hell man?  I was branded the AH from there on out.\n\nI was gob smacked.  Probably the reason why I hate hypocrisy so much today.\n\nAnyway, the giveaway here is that it really screws with your head, and I resented them for years over something so dumb that could have easily been avoided.\n\nI know this is a very long story just to say:\n\nNTA", "NTA. And you need to respond to her that, if he had actually follow through with any of his promises of trips when you were a kid, you wouldn\u2019t need to do this in the first place.

Especially to children. Put a stop to it.", "NAH.  This is tough though.  He sounds both lovely and painfully oblivious, not understanding how hurtful his unfulfilled promises ended up being when he just wanted to bring you joy.  \n\n\nIs it possible that you could plan a trip to this place that's 2 hours away - if it's within your means, of course - and invite him to join you for the day?
