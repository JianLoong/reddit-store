{"id": 29564, "submission_id": "17f46fq", "title": "AITA for telling my uncle to stop \"gifting\" my daughter extravagant trips", "selftext": "So, a little backstory. When my sisters and I were kids, every year for our birthdays and Christmas my uncle would give us cards. Inside those cards would be a printed out picture of some place (i.e. local theme parks, the zoo, aquarium, museums, any place a kid would love to go). After we opened them, he would tell us that we're going to that place. He would say things like \"it's gonna be the best trip of your life!\" That would obviously make us very excited. Here's the thing. We never went on any of those trips. We never went to any of those places. \n\nAs a young kid, it would be disappointing. But after a while I started expecting it and just going along with it. I don't hold any animosity towards him at all obviously. As an adult now, I understand he did that because he didn't have the means to buy us gifts. \n\nHere's where I'm starting to have a little bit of an issue with it. My daughter's fifth birthday was last week. My uncle gave her a card, she opened it to find a printed out picture of a theme park about two hours away from our house. And he promised her a fun weekend away. He promised her things like a giant hotel room with a swimming pool, all the snacks she could ever want, and tickets to every show she wants to see at the park. She was over the moon. For the past week, my daughter has talked non-stop about this trip. She keeps telling me how excited she is and how excited her whole class at school is for her. It breaks my heart to look at that smile on her face knowing it's not gonna happen. I remember how disappointing it was for me, and I don't want her to go through that. \n\nSo. I texted my uncle. Here's what the message said, \"Hi! Your message in \\[daughter's name\\] card was so beautiful. Do you think next time you could leave out the promise of an extravagant trip? The thought and gesture is amazing. However, I never know what to say when she asks me when this trip will be. She absolutely loves spending time with you so I know the promise of even a nice lunch together would make her so happy.\"\n\nHe never responded, but my aunt told me he was upset. She said something like he was offended that I implied the only thing he could afford was a \"nice lunch.\" I didn't mean it like that at all. I just wanted him to understand that she loves him and wants to spend time with him and he doesn't need to promise impossible things to make that happen. But I can see why he interpreted it the way he did. And that's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. This has been an unspoken thing in my family for so many years so I'm now wondering if I should've just kept it that way. I just can't stand the thought of my little girl getting disappointed so many times. My sisters and my mom agree with me. My mom even said she wished she stopped it when we were kids.

There isn\u2019t one nice thing about what he\u2019s doing. \n\nTell him he\u2019s no longer allowed to give gifts because he\u2019s a known liar, and that all attempts will be intercepted by you.", "NTA, but why are you being sensitive to his feelings when he wasn't sensitive to yours when you were a child? Tell him that his actions caused you repeated disappointment when he didn't follow through on his promises and that you don't want your child to experience the same. IOUs are not presents. As you say, a lunch or an activity on the day would be lovely, but other than that, stick to an actual gift or give nothing at all.", "NTA and I would definitely protect your daughter. Because that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing. The disappointment for everyone when it doesn\u2019t happen is so harsh for a child. It\u2019s not a life lesson she needs to learn. Too bad he\u2019s upset about your implication. Your daughter comes first. He\u2019s making empty promises and setting her up to not believe or trust when someone gives her something exciting. You already went through that and no how it feels. She doesn\u2019t deserve that also.", "NTA. He is absolutely in the wrong.

Any idea he might have that the child is given a wonderful dream and is satisfied with that is pure delusion -- and this is me assuming no malice on his part. He doesn't need to have any in order to be hurting children's feelings with his behavior. The behavior does that regardless of his intentions. \n\nI think it's high time this is spelled out to him clearly. He has no room to be offended here and is only able to feel that way because he is so deluded. \n\nThe bottom line is that while his feelings will be the ones being hurt for once hopefully an end will finally be put to him hurting the feelings of the children in your family, as should have happened years ago when he first started doing this.\n\nETA: The unspoken rule in your family is to sacrifice the children for your uncle's sake. This has always been wrong thinking. The innocent children should not have to repeatedly suffer disappointment just so your uncle doesn't have to feel sad the one time he is told what his actions are actually doing to the children.", "People who gaslight others usually get offended when they're called out.

You did exactly the same thing to me and my sisters when we were children, so I know for a fact how much it hurts to have these grand promises made but never seen through, and I will not allow you to hurt my daughter in the same way. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a lack or time, finances or another reason, it is unacceptable to make a child feel this way. \n\nYou know my daughter loves spending time with you, she would have been so happy with a trip to the local park and ice cream - spending TIME with you, instead now I will have to deal with a little girls broken heart (like mine was many times). \n\nPlease think about the consequences of your actions, just because you don\u2019t witness them doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t happen.\u201d", "NTA and he's a massive one for doing that.

I\u2019d be like hey! She\u2019s so excited for the trip! When can you take her? We will make sure to clear our schedules since she really wants to go. And I would just text him that everyday and see what happens. If he gets annoyed just be like, yeah so how do you think my child feels that you\u2019re lying to her.", "NTA. If your own mother said she wished she stopped it for y\u2019all, then you stop it for your child. That comment alone tells you your mother didn\u2019t appreciate when he did it to her and she, for whatever reason, didn\u2019t stop it or controlled it. At least, you KNOW what he will do and can stop it head first as this is NOT okay to do to a child. If he broke, he broke and needs to do things that support his brokeness. But tryna act rich and like you gotta like that but fails to uphold your end, will end up with no one taking you seriously and doing what Op is doing. Tell your uncle he either needs to stop doing what he\u2019s doing with the fake promises and find something you ACTUALLY can do or just don\u2019t offer to do anything at all but definitely tell your uncle how you feel/felt about what he did when you were a child, so you know what you\u2019re saying is coming from a place to not repeat certain things.", "Who the eff cares if your uncle is offended?

Call him up and say \"Daughter cannot stop talking about the weekend trip, would the weekend of the 15th or the 30th work best for you? Because I am planning a spa weekend while you take her with a romantic couples dinner with SO.\" Pin down a date. Don't let him forget about it. Don't let him break the hearts of a new generation of niblings. If there's pushback, point out the dozens of failed promises that broke your little heart time after time.", "NTA.

If he did that for years already, everybody already knows that he can't afford more than a 'nice lunch'. Why does he still do that same old trick?\n\nEven your mother wanted to stop this years ago, but somehow she wasn't able to do. So, go ahead and stop him now.

He wants to impress your children as he wanted to impress you and your sisters (it's normal for parent/older family to want to be seen as providers and spoilers of kids). I think the gesture is sweet and you do, too, it seems.\n\nBut you're totally right. Any intent to make your daughters happy will be outweighed by them getting crushed when it doesn't happen. I feel like you were very kind in pointing out that he didn't need to do that and everyone would be happy with something smaller.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes someone's insecurity is SO bad that even saying \"you don't need to be insecure about this\" is going to set them off. It's one of those touchy parts of human brains. But I think you acted honorably.", "Technically he's been gifting vision board material. Because he's not actually following through on any of it. I understand him not being able to afford the trips, but the expectation is still there. Especially for children and that's just not okay. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your uncle is a rotten guy. Getting a little kid excited about going somewhere special and never following through on the trip is cruel. The adults in your family should have told him to stop doing this years ago when you were little. \n\nStopping this charade is the best thing you can do for your daughter. Your uncle feels bad?

Emphasise how your daughter has told everyone at her school about it and would be so embarrassed in front of them, and so disappointed, if it doesn't happen. It's not too late, so hold him to it. If he comes up with excuses, or even a good reason why it can't happen, then you can tell him how miserable it made you as a child, and that you will not allow him to put your child through the same bullcrap and disappointment. Tell him he either has to specify a date when these things are going to happen, armed make sure they happen, or stop doing it. Moving forward you will have to intercept his cards and open them to take out the false promise gifts before your child sees it. NTA", "ETA uncle is obviously TA for gifting empty promises. He wants credit for the thought without any action! \n\nI think you\u2019re TA because as a parent, you should shield your child from someone like this.

As you know, a child takes a promise very seriously and disappointment hurts forever.
