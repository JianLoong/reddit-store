{"id": 29564, "submission_id": "17f46fq", "title": "AITA for telling my uncle to stop \"gifting\" my daughter extravagant trips", "selftext": "So, a little backstory. When my sisters and I were kids, every year for our birthdays and Christmas my uncle would give us cards. Inside those cards would be a printed out picture of some place (i.e. local theme parks, the zoo, aquarium, museums, any place a kid would love to go). After we opened them, he would tell us that we're going to that place. He would say things like \"it's gonna be the best trip of your life!\" That would obviously make us very excited. Here's the thing. We never went on any of those trips. We never went to any of those places. \n\nAs a young kid, it would be disappointing. But after a while I started expecting it and just going along with it. I don't hold any animosity towards him at all obviously. As an adult now, I understand he did that because he didn't have the means to buy us gifts. \n\nHere's where I'm starting to have a little bit of an issue with it. My daughter's fifth birthday was last week. My uncle gave her a card, she opened it to find a printed out picture of a theme park about two hours away from our house. And he promised her a fun weekend away. He promised her things like a giant hotel room with a swimming pool, all the snacks she could ever want, and tickets to every show she wants to see at the park. She was over the moon. For the past week, my daughter has talked non-stop about this trip. She keeps telling me how excited she is and how excited her whole class at school is for her. It breaks my heart to look at that smile on her face knowing it's not gonna happen. I remember how disappointing it was for me, and I don't want her to go through that. \n\nSo. I texted my uncle. Here's what the message said, \"Hi! Your message in \\[daughter's name\\] card was so beautiful. Do you think next time you could leave out the promise of an extravagant trip? The thought and gesture is amazing. However, I never know what to say when she asks me when this trip will be. She absolutely loves spending time with you so I know the promise of even a nice lunch together would make her so happy.\"\n\nHe never responded, but my aunt told me he was upset. She said something like he was offended that I implied the only thing he could afford was a \"nice lunch.\" I didn't mean it like that at all. I just wanted him to understand that she loves him and wants to spend time with him and he doesn't need to promise impossible things to make that happen. But I can see why he interpreted it the way he did. And that's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. This has been an unspoken thing in my family for so many years so I'm now wondering if I should've just kept it that way. I just can't stand the thought of my little girl getting disappointed so many times. My sisters and my mom agree with me. My mom even said she wished she stopped it when we were kids.

There isn\u2019t one nice thing about what he\u2019s doing. \n\nTell him he\u2019s no longer allowed to give gifts because he\u2019s a known liar, and that all attempts will be intercepted by you.", "NTA, but why are you being sensitive to his feelings when he wasn't sensitive to yours when you were a child? Tell him that his actions caused you repeated disappointment when he didn't follow through on his promises and that you don't want your child to experience the same. IOUs are not presents. As you say, a lunch or an activity on the day would be lovely, but other than that, stick to an actual gift or give nothing at all.", "NTA and I would definitely protect your daughter. Because that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing. The disappointment for everyone when it doesn\u2019t happen is so harsh for a child. It\u2019s not a life lesson she needs to learn. Too bad he\u2019s upset about your implication. Your daughter comes first. He\u2019s making empty promises and setting her up to not believe or trust when someone gives her something exciting. You already went through that and no how it feels. She doesn\u2019t deserve that also.", "NTA. He is absolutely in the wrong. He lied to you when you were a child, and he is lying to your daughter now. You stomp that behaviour, HARD.

Any idea he might have that the child is given a wonderful dream and is satisfied with that is pure delusion -- and this is me assuming no malice on his part. He doesn't need to have any in order to be hurting children's feelings with his behavior. The behavior does that regardless of his intentions. \n\nI think it's high time this is spelled out to him clearly. He has no room to be offended here and is only able to feel that way because he is so deluded. \n\nThe bottom line is that while his feelings will be the ones being hurt for once hopefully an end will finally be put to him hurting the feelings of the children in your family, as should have happened years ago when he first started doing this.\n\nETA: The unspoken rule in your family is to sacrifice the children for your uncle's sake. This has always been wrong thinking. The innocent children should not have to repeatedly suffer disappointment just so your uncle doesn't have to feel sad the one time he is told what his actions are actually doing to the children.", "People who gaslight others usually get offended when they're called out.

I only wish I'd stood up for my kids in similar situations! NTA", "NTA\n\nYour uncles intentions might be good, but doing this to a small child is just cruel. And your uncle playing a victim of hurt feelings, GOOD! He deserves some hurt feelings for his broken promises in order to boost his ego. \n\nThere's zero wrong in affording to gift just a lunch.

You did exactly the same thing to me and my sisters when we were children, so I know for a fact how much it hurts to have these grand promises made but never seen through, and I will not allow you to hurt my daughter in the same way. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a lack or time, finances or another reason, it is unacceptable to make a child feel this way. \n\nYou know my daughter loves spending time with you, she would have been so happy with a trip to the local park and ice cream - spending TIME with you, instead now I will have to deal with a little girls broken heart (like mine was many times). \n\nPlease think about the consequences of your actions, just because you don\u2019t witness them doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t happen.\u201d", "NTA and he's a massive one for doing that.

For years they did this, and I never understood why.\n\nIt wasn't even about the gifts but rather the fact that they made me excited just to disappoint me.

I turned down offers of 4 other cribs because she had a lovely one, but when the time came she gave me a dumb reason why I couldn't have it. I was so upset that I had turned down other offers. She never gave us clothes or anything else either. \n\nDon't promise what you don't plan to deliver!", "NTA. Someone should have stopped him from doing this years ago.

You might understand it now as an adult, but a) you're not asking for something extravagant, and b) your uncle is only gifting disappointment.

Then when he doesn't post it's been rescheduled/ he didn't take her. Tag ****everyone****. Public shame does wonders.\n\n\n\nThird also mean plan. Promise them stuff and don't deliver.

I wish I had a tradition that made me a good person for not spending money, but at least I don't lie to children.

Should OP admit that *they* made the trip or pretend the uncle pulled through when he didn't? \n\nI would say it's absolutely counterproductive, bc what happens if the uncle suggests a more expensive place or somewhere that's farther away next time?
