She had a small list of mandatory daily chore that she has to do to teach responsibility and contribute to the house (stuff like make her bed, take dirty clothes to the laundry room, put dishes into the dishwasher). But then there\u2019s another list of more difficult or time consuming chores that she gets paid for (unloading the dish washer is a dollar, watering the plants is a dollar, folding laundry is 2 dollars etc). She has to pick at least 3 of the more difficult chores to do per week, but then she can do more if she wants to earn money. I think this encourages her to prioritize if she wants to save up for something or if she\u2019d rather just play more that week. My kid is responsible and she usually does more than required and saves her money. As a result she\u2019s able to buy herself the toys stuff she doesn\u2019t get as gifts. \n\nSo the issue is that my boyfriend recently moved in with me. He has an 11 year old daughter that stays with us every other weekend. He likes my chore system and wants his daughter to participate as well. That\u2019s fine but she\u2019s there way less often so my daughter usually gets to most of the chores, especially the stuff that pays more. She also saves a lot so she usually has a bunch of cash stashed in her room. This makes my boyfriends daughter jealous and sad. He wants me to limit the chores that my daughter is allowed to do so there are some left for his daughter so she can earn money too. I told him no. He can come up with a separate chore list for his daughter if he wants, but tbh there isn\u2019t much left that needs to be done. I get that he wants his daughter to earn spending money too, but we\u2019ve been doing it this way for years and I don\u2019t want to limit my daughter. It doesn\u2019t seem fair to my daughter who lives here full time. I think her own mother can have a chore system at her house if she wants.

I'd say if you're not strapped for cash have one load and the other unload the dishwasher and they each get a dollar.

You don't have to start over, but a bit of modifying is in order. \n\nThe easiest would be \"reset\" the paid chores starting on the weekend.  Instead of having all week for your child to snag up all the good ones, this kind of set the tone that everyone is in it together instead of bf's daughter only getting the leftovers.\n\nYou can do what you want, but on the surface it seems like you are low-key trying to edge out the other child.

If he\u2019s expecting it all to be on your shoulders, I don\u2019t fully agree with that.

None of you, particularly not his daughter, can control what the mom does at her house when it comes to chores, so that argument is garbage.

My 9-year-old helps me wipe down the tub once a week. My 12-year-old helps me dust my shelves once a month.\n\n There are more than just the daily or weekly chores. If there are things that only need to be done like once a month, why couldn't those be like something for her?\n\n I would absolutely have your boyfriend sit down and brainstorm this with you as this is his child, and unless he was willing to sit down and put in the mental work for this list, I wouldn't do it. You could acknowledge it and empathize, but until he's willing to help you at least brainstorm some alternatives, you're on a great path for your kiddo I think.\n\nI do something similar with my kids. Although we use different size pom poms, and they exchange that for\"money\" that we put into a bank account for them so they can have spending money when we go out.

The idea of her getting her own chore list is great, so maybe there are outside things she could help with like lawn work or washing the vehicles or vacuuming them, weeding flower gardens. There are always options so that even when she is just there during short periods, she should feel as though she is a part of something, after all, you are family also and having stepparents is rough for some kids as they are not always treated well. This is something your boyfriend and you could work out together, so it doesn't seem like you really don't care for his daughter or whether she is treated the same when she visits. This does not need to limit your daughter in anyway, it just means you and your boyfriend need to get creative. If she doesn't have much opportunity at home with her financially strapped mom, then you have the opportunity to enrich her life in a way that could benefit her greatly. A parent's significant other can seriously affect a child's life by the way that child gets treated, I've seen children that feel unwanted and unloved because they are not included in the same way as the partners kids. This is so sad, yet it happens all the time.

There can still be additional, harder chores that are worth more money. \n\nWe have 2 kids, 10 and 13, and have used a similar system. They have a set of daily chores such as make bed and hang up bath towels and feed the dog. Then they each have separate chores they get allowance for such as emptying the dishwasher, cleaning up after dinner, picking up the dog poo and gathering all the trash. They get their age in allowance each week. The 10yr old gets $10 and the 13 yr old gets $13. This is split between their debit card accounts and their savings account and ONLY if they do all their assigned chores. Then I have other chores they can opt to do and they often ask for a chore so they can earn more spending money. These chores have a higher payout and 100% goes on their debit cards to spend. These chores include cleaning the baseboards downstairs $10, brushing the pool $10 (we don\u2019t have lawn or pool maintenance, the pool is my job and I hate it LOL) vacuuming and dusting the stairs $5.

Provided these chores are always done together (one child can't get $10 for cleaning the kitchen by themselves).\n\nA separate set of chores that pay slightly more ($3 for helping cook dinner, $4 for cleaning toilet, $15 for deep clean of bathroom) for the older child is also good compromise. The 11 yo is older, so you can structure this as a list of chores your daughter is able to participate in once she turns 11 as well.\n\nPaying the child for doing chores at her mother's house could work, but I'd worry the mother might agree to say she'd done chores she hasn't just to get an allowance.\n\nIMO there are three issues here: teaching responsibility, giving a child some money of their own (to have some fun money, and to teach financial responsibility), but also incentivizing learning how to do basic house stuff.\n\nLearning how to clean a bathroom or kitchen properly, as well as learning to take pleasure in collaboratively running a nice, clean, harmonious household, are important life skills that many kids don't learn, and then they move out to become terrible roommates (speaking from personal experience here).", "Some chores don\u2019t get paid for, and they need to learn to keep themselves, their room and shared spaces clean.

But I also think if they are blending families, they need to be inclusive of things like this. Saying the dad should come up with chores is not useful since OP admits there\u2019s few desirable ones left. Allowing daughter to choose all the good chore and leave the stepchild with crappy ones will only breed resentment. Work together and figure something out.

The parents need to find a way to treat their children equally, not just teach one to be happy with less. OPs boyfriend is invariably contributing to the 9yos quality of life. The 11yo old might not be able to enjoy a similar quality of life, living with a single mother, so small things like pocket money are even more important to preserving harmony. A really low bar.\n\nYes, jealousy over other people having things is a part of life everyone should learn to move past. I think a common way to deal with that is not spending a ton of time around people who have significantly more than you, and thus not having those things rubbed in their faces, so to speak.
