She had a small list of mandatory daily chore that she has to do to teach responsibility and contribute to the house (stuff like make her bed, take dirty clothes to the laundry room, put dishes into the dishwasher). But then there\u2019s another list of more difficult or time consuming chores that she gets paid for (unloading the dish washer is a dollar, watering the plants is a dollar, folding laundry is 2 dollars etc). She has to pick at least 3 of the more difficult chores to do per week, but then she can do more if she wants to earn money. I think this encourages her to prioritize if she wants to save up for something or if she\u2019d rather just play more that week. My kid is responsible and she usually does more than required and saves her money. As a result she\u2019s able to buy herself the toys stuff she doesn\u2019t get as gifts. \n\nSo the issue is that my boyfriend recently moved in with me. He has an 11 year old daughter that stays with us every other weekend. He likes my chore system and wants his daughter to participate as well. That\u2019s fine but she\u2019s there way less often so my daughter usually gets to most of the chores, especially the stuff that pays more. She also saves a lot so she usually has a bunch of cash stashed in her room. This makes my boyfriends daughter jealous and sad. He wants me to limit the chores that my daughter is allowed to do so there are some left for his daughter so she can earn money too. I told him no. He can come up with a separate chore list for his daughter if he wants, but tbh there isn\u2019t much left that needs to be done. I get that he wants his daughter to earn spending money too, but we\u2019ve been doing it this way for years and I don\u2019t want to limit my daughter. It doesn\u2019t seem fair to my daughter who lives here full time. I think her own mother can have a chore system at her house if she wants.

I'd say if you're not strapped for cash have one load and the other unload the dishwasher and they each get a dollar.

If he\u2019s expecting it all to be on your shoulders, I don\u2019t fully agree with that.
