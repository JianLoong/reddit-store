She had a small list of mandatory daily chore that she has to do to teach responsibility and contribute to the house (stuff like make her bed, take dirty clothes to the laundry room, put dishes into the dishwasher). But then there\u2019s another list of more difficult or time consuming chores that she gets paid for (unloading the dish washer is a dollar, watering the plants is a dollar, folding laundry is 2 dollars etc). She has to pick at least 3 of the more difficult chores to do per week, but then she can do more if she wants to earn money. I think this encourages her to prioritize if she wants to save up for something or if she\u2019d rather just play more that week. My kid is responsible and she usually does more than required and saves her money. As a result she\u2019s able to buy herself the toys stuff she doesn\u2019t get as gifts. \n\nSo the issue is that my boyfriend recently moved in with me. He has an 11 year old daughter that stays with us every other weekend. He likes my chore system and wants his daughter to participate as well. That\u2019s fine but she\u2019s there way less often so my daughter usually gets to most of the chores, especially the stuff that pays more. She also saves a lot so she usually has a bunch of cash stashed in her room. This makes my boyfriends daughter jealous and sad. He wants me to limit the chores that my daughter is allowed to do so there are some left for his daughter so she can earn money too. I told him no. He can come up with a separate chore list for his daughter if he wants, but tbh there isn\u2019t much left that needs to be done. I get that he wants his daughter to earn spending money too, but we\u2019ve been doing it this way for years and I don\u2019t want to limit my daughter. It doesn\u2019t seem fair to my daughter who lives here full time. I think her own mother can have a chore system at her house if she wants. But she struggles financially and can\u2019t really afford any kind of allowance. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really my problem.

What about setting up the table for dinner? Vacuuming?", "NTA. Since she is only there every other weekend though I am sure you could find a special set of chores for her.

Let your daughter continue the regular stuff that is daily or weekly and his daughter can do stuff that can wait 2weeks to a month.", "NTA.  He can think up a few chores for her to do.

He's putting his responsibility onto you to solve an issue he's created.\n\nYou are NTA but your boyfriend seems to be.", "NTA.  I can always come up with more chores!

They all need to get done, even the very last one. \n\nEssentially, your BF is asking for dibs on the chores so that his kid can get the \"good ones\" and your daughter gets the less desirable ones (like toilet cleaning). The other alternative is he adds more to the list and saves them for his kid. \n\nCalling dibs and saving chores isn't reasonable, it means stuff isn't getting done in a timely manner.

If he wants to give her money for chores, then he can communicate with his daughter\u2019s mom and ask her what chores she does over there and just pay her for that instead of trying to limit what your daughter can earn. Or you guys can come to an agreement on a different set of chores that don\u2019t infringe on your daughter\u2019s chores, like loading the dishwasher, running loads of laundry, etc especially because she\u2019s older and what\u2019s considered difficult for a 9 year old shouldn\u2019t be difficult for her.", "NTA\n\nhe can give his daughter money for chores he makes up", "NTA.

He does need to work out chores for his own child to do, either at your house or at the mothers house.  Maybe she can wash or clean his car to earn some spending money.", "What's your goal with the families?  Is this his daughter is his, yours is yours? Do you want to be an integrated family?  \n\nIt's either ESA or NAH, depending on your goals I guess.", "NTA!\n\nSo your bf has his daughter 4 days out of the month and wants his daughter to do chores at his house on those days?

It seems like chores are a custodial parent thing so just let her have fun the 96 hours she gets to see her dad every month.", "Could the chore list reset on Saturday morning?  That way on weekends when both girls are there they would both have an equal shot at the chore list?  Then anything that is left after the weekend your daughter has the option of doing during the week?", "Could you BF not give his daughter the money for doing chores at her mums house then if that what he\u2019s wishes to do.", ">She also saves a lot so she usually has a bunch of cash stashed in her room.

But she struggles financially and can\u2019t really afford any kind of allowance\n\nSoooooo, why isn't your BF offering to pay for a similar system for his daughter at her mother's house?\n\nThat'd be the logical way to handle this situation.\n\nHis daughter gets to earn a little cash, learn responsibility, it's a co-parenting win, and everyone should be happier...", "NTA. Who is going to be paying his daughter for the chores? Are you supposed to take away from your daughter and give to his with your own money or will he be financially contributing? Because it sounds like he wants to find a reason for you to give money to his daughter. I\u2019m really confused how a grown adult man with a job can\u2019t create a chore list for his child and reward her. Also\u2026 I would watch the money your daughter earns and make sure some isn\u2019t going missing since you\u2019re saying that your boyfriend\u2019s daughter is jealous.", "YTA. Saving up a couple of chores for the other child to do is a completely reasonable request. If your kid is so mature and responsible she can learn about being considerate and sharing with her stepsister. It\u2019s not a huge change he\u2019s requesting.\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty icky that you\u2019re starting to blend families with your boyfriend but see his child\u2014 in theory your future stepdaughter\u2014 as \u2018not my problem\u2019.", "NAH.   \n\n\nThis is just a tough family situation with no easy answer. It's reasonable for you to not want to diminish your daughter's experience, and it's understandable for him to not want his daughter to feel otherized by this system.  \n\n\nFiguring out solutions to these problems is kind of what bringing together families is all about. Both of you standing up for your biological children is laudable, though both of you should also come together to find a solution for the other, as well; Simply because that'll help strengthen everyone's bond.", "NAH, but teamwork makes the dream work. I'd say if you're not strapped for cash have one load and the other unload the dishwasher and they each get a dollar. So pick a set time for some of these chores, maybe Saturday morning, so bf daughter can participate. They do 50-50 of a chore without making each other miserable? Each gets a dollar. And have bf come up with some chores. You need to come together as a family to make this work.", "I get where you are coming from, why screw around with a good setup, but YTA.\n\nThe system needs to change b/c it isn't fair or equitable in any way. Right now it is set up for ONLY your child, no intruders allowed!  You don't have to start over, but a bit of modifying is in order. \n\nThe easiest would be \"reset\" the paid chores starting on the weekend.  Instead of having all week for your child to snag up all the good ones, this kind of set the tone that everyone is in it together instead of bf's daughter only getting the leftovers.\n\nYou can do what you want, but on the surface it seems like you are low-key trying to edge out the other child. It is giving me an \"ick\" feel, and i don't really know why.", "I\u2019m leaning NTA but also curious, is he willing to put money in the pot to pay his daughter for her chores? Or would he expect you to? If he\u2019s willing, I\u2019m sure he could think up some more things for her to do. If he\u2019s expecting it all to be on your shoulders, I don\u2019t fully agree with that. It\u2019s just something to consider for the future of a blended family if you\u2019re wanting him to be around a while.", "Maybe just a little TA.   \nI don't think it would be too hard for the both of you to tweak the system so there are some chores which can only be done on the weekend.   \nIt seems like you could absolutely meet him half way.", "YTA. You want to have a blended family household, then act like it. \n\nYou can\u2019t have your cake and eat too. This is either as much his home (and by extension his daughters home) as it is yours or he\u2019s just a rando tenant.\n\nWork with your BF to come up with a solution that optimizes both daughters home experience.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to budge or compromise - then you really should rethink living together.", "YTA.  None of you, particularly not his daughter, can control what the mom does at her house when it comes to chores, so that argument is garbage.  In the end, you want to maintain a system that treats his daughter as a second class do to zen in the household so that your daughter doesn\u2019t have to compromise in the slightest.  Not a promising way to start out cohabitating.", "Honestly, YTA. It's not that har,  let the girls pick one chore each and share another. Have them split folding the laundry and pick one of the other two chores.", "> He wants me to limit the chores that my daughter is allowed to do so there are some left for his daughter so she can earn money too. **I told him no**\n\nYTA. Your house. Your rules... Your judgement.
