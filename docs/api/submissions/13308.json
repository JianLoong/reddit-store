{"id": 13308, "submission_id": "123jdb4", "title": "WIBTA if I breakup with my girlfriend a week before our 3 week trip abroad?", "selftext": "  \n\nSo I'm in a right pickle and I don't know what to do. We have been together since last summer but we live far away from each other and don't see each other in person that much. Me and by best friend were planning this epic trip involving a particular activity that can have up to 3 people, and it seemed like a good idea to invite her to join us. She was keen and has paid for her own flights, her share of the cost of the activity, has booked the time off work and told all her friends and family she's going. \n\nThe problem is, in the time since the arrangements were made I have realised we are absolutely incompatible and I need to break up with her. This really hit me this week when after an argument I thought we had already resolved she ended up sending me some quite horrible messages, including accusing me of cheating. She later suggested that if I can't stop being 'weird' I shouldn't go on the trip because I'm having some kind of breakdown and that her and my friend should go without me. The 'being weird'/having a breakdown in her mind is due to me being unwilling to spend several hours a day on the phone with her while I have family friends visiting and am very busy. This is also a part of what the arguement was about. \n\nI know I'm the asshole for letting the situation come to this and I should have realised sooner but didn't want to admit it to myself. Now I know that I cannot continue the relationship, I don't know what's the least asshole thing to do. \n\nI could break up with her now and offer to either repay all the money she has spent or still go together as friends and I will share rooms with my friend instead. Honesty is the best policy right and she gets to make an informed decision on whether she goes or not? I know I don't have the right to tell her she can't come but I do worry that she will come on the trip and spend the time trying to make me change my mind, or just try to ruin it for me out of spite. I hate to think she would do this but the way she has been messaging makes me think its possible. And I do have my friend to consider who would be stuck in the middle of it if it got ugly.\n\nOr I could just try to get through the trip and wait till we get back. Some of my family are saying that I WBTA and I can't break up with her with just a week to go when she has invested so much into the trip. I feel that it would be awful to pretend but the main reason I'm even considering this is that she is a very proud person and cares a lot about how things look to other people, another thing that makes us incompatible. I'm thinking this option means she doesn't have to deal with explaining to everyone why she isn't going if she decides she doesn't want too, doesn't waste the time off work and we can quietly end things once its over. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I break up with her before the trip?", "created_utc": 1679914625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123jdb4/wibta_if_i_breakup_with_my_girlfriend_a_week/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I might be the asshole if I do this because she is really looking forward to it and will have to explain to everyone she'd told why she isn't going and will be stuck with 3 weeks off work and nothing to do with them, or will come anyway and it will be awkward at best and a lot of drama at worst for all of us.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Break up with her and repay her for the trip, but don\u2019t leave the option open for her to still go. She will absolutely ruin the trip for you and your poor friend who is completely innocent in this.  Should probably have the friend weigh in before you make decisions.", "Don't they make horror movies about vacations like this? Someone gets all stabby in a mountain cabin or someone gets framed with drugs in a foreign country. But it would be awkward AF even if there was no homicide.\n\nBreak up now. Offer to reimburse her if she cancels her bookings. If she refuses, you and friend need to change your plans and vacation elsewhere, somewhere she doesn't know about.\n\nNTA", "YWNBTA, especially if you offer to repay her for everything. Sometimes people just aren't meant to be together, and you wouldn't want to spend 3 weeks with someone you're planning on dumping. That's how you get the midsommar treatment lol.", "She's TA for saying you shouldn't go on a trip you originally planned.  Don't pretend for her, break up.  Offer the three choices: Pay her back, she goes as a friend only, or she can just not go.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, people literally get left at the alter, it\u2019s better than going though with it. Break up with her, pay her back her portion and go on the trip without her. It is the least shitty option available.", "NTA. Be honest and if you do have the means to get her her money back do that. I would hate to look back on a trip like that and realize my partner was planning on breaking up w me the whole time", "This one is interesting. I hope there\u2019s an update", "NTA. \n\nYou're even willing to come to several compromises, repay for her expenses, have her come as a friend, etc. Regardless of what you decide, or what transpires, you're being honest!\n\nBetter to do it before the trip than it blowing up on everyone's face during, where it will be messier, more expensive, and painful for everyone.\n\nLet us know how it goes.", "NTA. Break up now. She has a lot of nerve trying to suggest you bow out of the trip and she goes with your friend. She sounds nuts.", "The writing is on the wall but she\u2019s just not reading it, so dude you need to spell it out loud and clear. Talk to her. Lay out the options and let her decide. \n\nSpare a thought for your friend though. He didn\u2019t sign up for you sharing his room or a couple sniping at each other. Either way, he could be in for an awkward three weeks.", "NTA if you break up with her before the trip, and then she can decide if she wants to come along or not.\n\nDon't wait until after the trip, you would just be stringing her along, and trust me it'll make the trip awful (talking from experience, when I was the friend going with a couple were one of them wanted to break up, the other person could tell where things were headed and it was just a nightmare all around)", "Pull the plaster off. Time to end it. The way youve portrayed her isnt in a good light anyway, if she threatened that you shouldnt go on the trip, then obviously she doesnt care all that much. So dump her. NTA assuming she is as bad as she sounds", "NTA, but you do need a long talk.\n\nThe way you frame her, it seems that she needs some reassurance that you'll have fun spending all this time together. She isn't going to the sites, she was coming with you and your mutual friend. She wants to know it will be fun, and she is safe. \n\nYou not having time to call hours per day is fair, but don't use the excuse of family friends, just set some dates to call each day, and follow up.\n\nIf you break up, that's fine, but give her some real options:\n\n1. She comes along as friends, and acts that way\n2. She goes her seperate way once she is there\n3. She tries to get refunds, you refund the rest\n\nYou prob want to figure this out next time before you plan a weeklong event", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I say this because you say in your post I realized a couple/few weeks ago we were not compatible.  That was the moment in which you would not have been the asshole and it is now past.\n\nHowever, your mind is made up now and you know that the relationship is not a good fit and you need to break up.\n\nIt\"s your job to do that as soon as possible so you can both move on.  Like I said, you're already on asshole, but doing it now is understandable, doing it tomorrow makes you a bigger ah.\n\nStaying with her after typing the above out is a lie and you know that.\n\nYou say you have and can easily return the money and I would absolutely do this.\n\nEven having called you an ah--only the kind we all are and not a big one yet.

You need to end it and state you\u2019ll pay her back the funds, DO NOT go on the trip with her as she will either use it to get back at you or just plain ruin it. \n\nIt\u2019s also not fair to your friend to be stuck in the middle of this.\n\nIt would hurt her far worse to find out after/during the trip that she was only there to make up numbers etc.", "He shouldn\u2019t have to refund her at all.
