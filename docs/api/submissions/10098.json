How will he make friends at 13 years old alone in an unfamiliar state during summer vacation? YTA.", "INFO: What would your son do all summer in a strange place where he knows no one and you work?", "YTA for assuming he will just make friends. How would you feel if your dad hauled you away from your friends and your life every summer? He\u2019s 13. (I have a 13 yo too). He wants to be with his friends. Five years til college. In a few he will probably want a summer job and what\u2019s he likely to do? Get one where his friends work. Why take these summers from him, so he can spend what time you\u2019re not working with you? What will he do the rest of the time?\n\nThink about what\u2019s best for him. I guarantee if you force him to do this that he will resent you. Mine already resents her father for something similar.", "YTA. Not for wanting to move but for wanting your son to give up time with his friends just to make it easier on you.

He\u2019s got nothing where you\u2019re moving. Except you. He\u2019s got no friends there, no school, nothing that ties him there. You want him to just give up all his friends and activities for a long while just so you get what you want. Your son is still a kid, but he\u2019s old enough to know what he wants. He doesn\u2019t want to be away from all he knows for long periods of time. \n\nListen to your son. Don\u2019t try to force him to visit you for long periods of time when that\u2019s clearly not what he wants.", "I would strongly reconsider taking the job until your son is grown and left for college. You\u2019re obviously capable of doing this level of work, so more opportunities like this will become available to you in the future. But you cannot undo the lost time spent with your son. \n\nThe job opportunities will always be there, but your son only has a few short years left living at home. The arrangement that you have at the moment means that he is secure, and that he has the support and love of both of his parents. \n\nIf you move out of state, you will inevitably see him less, and not only will you see him less, if you go to court to try to force him to spend time at your house you will make yourself the bad guy and probably permanently damage your relationship with him.\n\nYou\u2019re working all day, he will have nothing to do during the day while you\u2019re there. He won\u2019t be spending time with you \u2013 he\u2019ll be sitting there feeling resentful that you forced him to be there, because you have put your desire for more money ahead of his need to have a stable upbringing, and two loving parents present in his life.\n\nYou are NTA, but you would be the arsehole if you try to force him into that situation via the courts. \n\nAnd I would suggest that you would be an arsehole if you moved away from him at this critical point in his life development. Teenage boys *need* a father figure. If you\u2019re not there, he\u2019ll find someone else; or he\u2019ll take his cues from tv or movies; or from older boys who may or may not have his best interests at heart, but who certainly won\u2019t have your life experience and abilities. \n\n>\tYour relationship with him is more important to his future any money that you can provide for college. \n\nThat stability that he currently has, will give him an emotional basis that will allow him to perform at a high level for the rest of his life. And you can\u2019t buy that with money.", "i dont think anyone would be the ahole in this scenario because its your choice if you want to get a larger salary and move, but it would affect how your son feels about spending time with you. it just depends on whether or not you want to spend more time with your son and earn less than you can/your regular wage or earn more money but spend less time with your son. you wouldn't be an ahole either way to me.", "YTA in this instance for going against your son's wishes.\n\nHowever, you haven't moved yet. Your son hasn't experienced living day to day life without you close by. By the time summer is there, maybe he'll change his mind & want to spend all his time with you.\n\nI think you should let your son take the decision on where he wants to be.

Up to you though!", "No one's the AH in this situation, especially if you're doing this to save up for your son's college fund.  But your son is just about to hit an age when he wants to spend more time with his friends than with his parents so I can understand why he wouldn't want to go for the whole summer if he has no one to hang out with when he gets there.  Also at 13 it may be time for your son's custody arrangement to be reviewed anyway as he's at a different stage of life now.   Or maybe consider moving out there for a year or two, having him over when you're taking annual leave yourself and then move back if that doesn't work out?", "I don't think anyone is TA...yet\nYou can either earn more money, pay for his college and live a nicer life, the cost is time with your son\nHe doesn't want to go because he will be away from his friends.

I understand where he is coming from\nIf you have more money you could perhaps afford to fly him to you a couple of times\nPerhaps discuss he could visit you for half of summer, sounds like you've had a pretty good deal so far such that he is able to spend some of term time with you\nAt the end of the day it's your choice to move or not and you can't help other people's reactions. If you forced him to chose or his mum to send him, you'll only damage the relationship with your son and ex, and like you say potentially the courts will rule not in your favour perhaps its best to keep it in house and discuss different options that work for you all\nMaybe he does Christmas and a month of summer with you. Maximising his time with you during the periods that count, and he gets time at home during summer and your ex has swapped Christmas with additional summer time.

It wasn't any one thing we just weren't working out. I moved to a new place just 5 minutes across town, so I could stay close to our son (13) The custody agreement was that his mother gets custody during the school year (September 1st to June 22nd) specifically, and I get it during the summer. Now because we lived so close and my ex-wife and I had a pretty good co-parenting relationship, this wasn't very strict. My son often visits for weekends during the school year, and during summer goes over his mom sometimes. Plus we lived in a city so with public transportation and such once he was older we pretty much let him and his friends go whereever as long as they were back at somebodies house at a decent hour.\n\nI recently got an offer for a new position on the West coast, it's almost double my salery now and has the chance for more advancement. The thing is that means when I move in the spring my son would have to fly over for the summer. We talked with his mother and he doesn't want to do that. He doesn't want to spend his summers away from all his friends, which I understand.\n\nThe way things work in my state, unless there's abuse kids my sons age have a lot of leeway with who they choose to live with. My son told me he doesn't want to go, and would prefer to just visit for a week or two once in the summer. I really don't want to lose so much time with my son. \n\nThe issue is that the court would probably listen to him, and if his mom fights this they might be able to change the custody to what he wants. I don't want to hurt my son's relationships but at the same time this job would allow me to pay for his college no problem.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I assume as you cannot fly to visit him you will be working and he will doing what exactly?   He is at that age in high school his friendship and connections are extremely important to his  future development and being able to deal with being an independent adult.  \n\nHe has stated what he wants, he has offered an compromise to you, he sounds much more mature than you at the moment.   I have seen many an adult that were forced to move in teenage years by parents as soon as they are old enough move back.   \n\nDo you have family in your home state, or would your Ex let you stay?  Why not offered to fly back on some weekends if you want to spend more quality time with him.", "NAH\n\nYou can move to provide better for your son but he doesn't have to give up his entire summer for you. You have to come to terms with that. Maybe he spends half his summer with you and you call weekly or more to stay connected to him.  Your new job sounds like it will help him later but it will be difficult in the mean time. \n\nEither way, he needs to be involved in the conversation and his wants need to be considered.", "YTA\n\nEven if you enforced the custody arrangement as it is, and even if your son agreed to it, you are still losing out on time with him. By your own admission, you currently are very flexible on when he is at each parents home and you see him over a lot of weekends, even if it isn't your actual custody schedule, why would you willingly give that up and then only see him for 8 weeks of the year?\n\n>I moved to a new place just 5 minutes across town, so I could stay close to our son (13)\n\nWhat's changed? I don't understand why you would willingly move yourself so far away from your child? Is the job offer really so once in a lifetime that you would never have this opportunity again? Are you struggling financially so much that your current role is untenable? Are you genuinely never going to be able to get a better role in your sector more? \n\nI get that college is expensive and all that, but are you going to want to pay for college for your son when you have very little contact and have barely seen him in 5 years, because that is likely what you will be doing.", "Kids just want their parents. They want to spend time with them. They could care less about the money. YTA if you chose money over your son.

Whatever you do stay in touch with him daily and make sure he knows he is a priority.", "NAH. You want to get ahead financially at a time when the world economy is tanking. Your kid rightfully has reservations about his social life, and USA has shit time off provisions as a general rule. \n\n\nMy two cents; kids are smarter than most adults give them credit for. Why not have a Saturday lunch with the kid AND your ex, and actually explain the pros and cons to them? Maybe the visiting could be a week every holiday season and half a summer instead? Work with your boy, genuinely listen to him, and see if maybe he suggests a middle ground that all the adults have overlooked. Good luck with it all, sounds like you're in a no win position and trying to do your best...", "Ask your son and his mother if he wants to go to college one day.  Tell him if you take the job, you will be able to pay for his college.  But if you move and they want to cut you off and your son doesn't want to visit, why would you go?  So if you stay, he pays his own college.   Maybe his mom cosigns his loans, but you don't.   Explain exactly how much college costs.  If they don't budge, I think you should stay.  Don't sacrifice 10 years of your relationship with your son to do something for him.  If you want to go for you,  accept it is for you. Also 13 is still young.   I think you could win in court still.  15 forget it.", "I assume he'll make new friends, plus it's mot like I'll be working all the time.", "With thirteen, his son has a mind of his own and is his own person.

You are watching too much Fox News. California is stunning and the cities are a lot of fun especially for younger people.

And I assume you'll be working during the day most weekdays? You won't have leave yet if you just start. So my question stands.", "No, no he will not.\n\nHe'll spend his time online trying to keep in touch with the friends he already has and not miss out on the things that happen with them.\n\nYour son will resent you. And yes, at some point he'll refuse to go at all.", "If he's not at school in that area, and only living there just over a couple of months a year, there's not much chance for him to make new friends. This is a genuinely awkward situation but just dismissing the difficulties it would cause for him doesn't help.\n\nCould you negotiate for more holiday in return for less pay so you could fly out and spend a chunk of the summer with him in his home town? Could you work remotely for a few weeks for a similar reason?

He is not 3, at 13 you can't make new friends after 1 day at the playground.\nIt looks like there's a chance for him not only not make new friends, but also loose some of his current friends.\n\nHave you done anything to make it easier for him to make friends at new place or overall have better summer with you? Like finding some activities, trips, art/sports course or whatever he likes? Maybe his best friend can come and stay for 2-3 weeks? Of course, your son could still feel it's better to stay in his hometown, but it looks like you haven't done anything to accommodate his needs so far.\n\nI'm not saying anything about taking/not taking the job.

He wants his son all summer and doesn't want to give up on time with him. He says he understands his kid but still makes it his sons obligation to see him enough instead of the other way around?

Not the best for him anyway. The best for you? You clearly think so.
