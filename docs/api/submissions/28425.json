Then a few days ago, she says I have an invite to her family\u2019s Thanksgiving meal. Even though I didn\u2019t say I was coming. Then she says that she wants to go to my family\u2019s Christmas vacation but I have to pay for her plane ticket. \n\nAt this point I was astonished but I kept my composure and offered to pay a portion of the ticket. She has a smaller Salary than mine so I understand she may not be able to afford the entire ticket. She said she will think about it. Immediately the next day first thing in the morning she texted may you please pay my ticket. I told her no. My family will be hosting her and providing transportation, lodging, and food. If you really want to come you can pay for your own ticket.

NTA. \n\nEveryone get their own relationship timeline, so while 6 months is slightly early for holidays together (in my mind), the holidays are coming up and you've been dating long enough that it wouldn't be weird to be included at all. \n\nBut there is a big difference between being invited to spend a holiday with an SO's family and INVITING YOURSELF. I live a couple of hours from my parents and we have very casual holidays together, so I can see myself bringing my partner of 6 months with me. But I would never invite myself on a family trip and ask for it to be paid for, that's an entirely different thing. First there is cost of course, second is family trips are more complicated than a shared meal, then there are logistics (families often share rooms, so how does adding a person change that), and finally, it us up to the family, not even you, if they want here there. \n\nI'd shut her down fully- if she feels she isn't getting the \"support\" she needs, well that is on her. I'd say additional red flag on her for using buzzwords to try and make her feelings your problem. Let me break this down for you:\n\n1. She stomps on basic etiquette by inviting herself to your family vacation- red flag\n2. She expects you to pay for her at 6 months in to the relationship- red flag\n3. She expects you to pay for her on something she invited herself to- red flag is now neon and glowing\n4. When you say no, she makes it about emotional support- run dude, run. \n\nWhen people have different expectations in relationships, no one is at fault. Her passing of her want of financial support and to go on a FREE vacation is not \"emotional support\" it is entitlement. Emotional support is canceling a night at the bar to be there when a pet is put down, or making breakfast before a big exam. Emotional support is never monetary, and it is never about having to match your SO's relationship timeline.", "NTA, she sounds at best immature, at worst a manipulator.\n\nShe's not feeling supported? Because you won't pay for her every whim? It would be different if you were expecting her there, but this is what she wants. Sounds to me like she wants a vacation on you and your families dime.\n\nPersonally going half is more than fair, does she expect you to pay for most things in the relationship, like food and dates?", "NTA. One doesn't just invite themselves to a family vacation, especially after only dating for 6 months.", "The fact that you titled it \u2018short term gf\u2019 rather than recent and that you don\u2019t care if she spends time with your family makes me wonder if you just have different senses of the seriousness right now.", "Whoa, red flag on that huge reaction of hers. Why is she crying and saying that she is not supported here? This sounds like either a huge manipulation or a massive miscommunication. Her reaction worries me more than anything.\n\nNTA", "NTA, run that chick is toxic.", "NTA but it sounds like she\u2019s not listening to you here.\n\nYou don\u2019t even want to do thanksgiving with her family, and don\u2019t seem to care if she comes to yours.\n\nI agree with you, as this is a new relationship. If she wants to be moving faster then she can break up with you, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being unreasonable", "NTA\n\nYou're fine having separate holidays.  She's pushing for holidays together and using emotions to manipulate you into paying her travel expenses.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Those are some flags as red as Santa's suit.", "NTA. Given the nature and context of your dilemma, you are under no obligation to pay for her ticket. The holidays can become needlessly convoluted with stress that defeats the purpose of gathering together to catch up and enjoy each other\u2019s company.", ">She then proceeded to cry and says she is not getting the support she needs in the relationship.\n\nI laughed SO hard at this. There are tears in my eyes as I type this. \n\nCongrats on dodging a gold-digging bullet. \n\nNTA", "NTA \nIt\u2019s a little weird that she invites herself and then ask you to pay for it..\nYou probably should talk with her about the expectations for this relationship on both sides, because it seems to me that you\u2019re not as serious on it as her or you feel like its going to fast (wich I understand) and for both of your sakes you should talk about it before someone gets hurt", "NTA. But if you continue to stay with this woman who appears to be either a grifter or a bit on the smothering side, then YTA", "NTA\n\nBTW, don't be surprised when she wants a \"cute little ring\" she saw, for Christmas.", "NTA\n\nSix months (seven or eight by the holidays) and you are traveling to visit each other\u2019s families? \n\nThat\u2019s crazy fast.", "NTA \n\n\ud83d\ude06 support comes in the form of cold hard cash for this girl. I'm lucky tears don't move me in any way.", "NTA. But what is really going on? She is not getting the support she needs?\n\nThis might not actually be about the holidays.\n\nThat being said the plane ticket thing is too much and too soon.", "YTA.\n\nJust be honest with the girl that you don't seea future together, rather than dancing around trying to make excuses about your \"hesitations.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her family will set an extra plate at the meal, no extra expense.  She wants you to pay for her airfare, and your family to pay for the rest.  You admit it is a long-distance romance (5-hour drive). You said you have split 50/50. Go back through things.  Has it really been 50/50?", "NTA\nShe seems to be the only one really enthused about joining eachother's family holidays.

Okay. Going along on your family's trip? That's another level.", "NTA What happened to her plans to leave around Christmas with her family? Hasnt she booked it?
