You could have phrased it better when talking to your fiance. \"I'm not feeling too social after all of this driving and helping, I feel drained and don't want to spend the next 13 hours feeling like I have to entertain people and socialize, is there anychance you could come back and maybe fly out another time.\"", "You pegged it in your explanation.\n\nOut on your big boy pants, you can deal with a car ride without her holding your hand.

Nothing adds up here. \n\nThe whole situation implies that your time, your comfort and your energy don\u2019t matter and you\u2019re being taken advantage of.
