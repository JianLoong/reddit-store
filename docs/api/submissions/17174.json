See her reasoning but shared misery is part of a relationship, esp when helping her family.", "Let's say everyone gets paid $10 an hour. For just the drive that $1040 plus gas. And you guys worked for 3 days. Using 8 hour days that's $960.\n\nYou guys probably worked longer hours than that and get paid better at your job so everyones time was worth more than that $2000+ figure. Now paying for moving with packing and unpacking services isn't cheap but there is a reason movers get paid.", "Are you sure you want to marry into this family?", "It sounds like you don\u2019t get much say in your relationship. There was no attempt at finding a compromise. Think hard before getting married if your feelings are routinely ignored. That\u2019s the sort of thing you need to work out in couples counselling *before* you make a legal commitment to each other.", "I love the references to Soul Plane AND Frontier", "NTA, and what kind of disorganised students can't move house? Unless the last place burned down or something, why move during exams?", "It was N--TA till you revealed important info in the comments.\n\n\nHer parents are paying MOST of your wedding AND your home renovations. They don't have the extra money to spend on hiring movers. Her parents told you It's too expensive. You seem very annoyed and stuck on that point. If you wanted to not help with the move you should have told them to keep more of the wedding or home renovation money they are spending on you and use that to hire movers instead.\n\nIf you didn't want to make the drive back you could have flown home on Sunday...and your girlfriend on Monday. But you didnt want to let her take a seperate flight from you.... You keep dodging that question too... Why is it a big deal to take different flights and let her spend the day with her sister??\n\nSorry but you went into ahole territory... Soft YTA.... The drive sucks... but there was room for you to be flexible and you chose not to.....", "NTA\n\nI understand your GF just wants to help her sister.  She is ignoring your needs.  \n\n13 hrs is a very long time in a car.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to do that with their future in-laws, without their partner.", "Do you mean you also have to take your card back, and basically be in convoy with her parents? Or share her parents' car? If it's the latter, why don't you also fly back?", "NTA but don\u2019t force this issue, just remember this when you\u2019re asked to do something similar in the future.", "No, you\u2019re NTA.", "Good lord that\u2019s a lot to do for someone else\u2019s family AND the boyfriend? I\u2019d feel very used if I did all that and my SO breezily announced she was staying longer without me. Can you get your own plane ticket home? \n\nNTA btw", "NTA and your fianc\u00e9 sounds ungrateful and selfish -", "That's really unreasonable of her imo.", "I see this all the time on Reddit.  I was in a bad situation and hired movers from a reputable company.  They showed up days late and stole or damaged a lot of my stuff.  Because of the contract I signed, I apparently had no recourse.  \n\nIf I ever have to move again I will absolutely be driving 13 hours one way.", "The fact they didn\u2019t pack anything bring this up several levels.", "Ahhhh. This changes things.", "Don't do her family any more favors", "I\u2019m all for helping others but this would have been one of those times a \u201cwork emergency\u201d would \u201cforce\u201d me to stay home.", "Hoo boy, you nailed it.  Fianc\u00e9 is great wanting to help, but this is five full days of really hard work for everyone. I don\u2019t blame his fianc\u00e9 for wanting to fly home & avoid the drive with 2 dogs, not a great life choice if you\u2019re in med school, but she\u2019s being really oblivious here. This family dynamic is a touch scary.", "So why can\u2019t you fly back on Sunday, and she can drive back with her parents on Monday?\u2026 definitely NTA!", "You\u2019re \u2026 splitting the gas? You\u2019re the free labor. Why would they ask you for gas money?", "They didn\u2019t \u201chelp\u201d with their own move. \n\nI\u2019m out.", "Well, is your fianc\u00e9 beside you?  You mentioned that they\u2019re giving you a gift to have your basement finished for your wedding, but for the love of heaven, if they say \u201cIt\u2019ll be cheaper if we do the work ourselves!\u201d  Well, they\u2019ll mean \u201cYour free time will be consumed for 6 months.\u201d  Get yourself self a nice meal OP, you\u2019ve earned it.", "NTA. Your girlfriend and -- by extension -- her family think of you as a useful idiot. They've shown you no consideration, overruled your very sensible suggestion and now expect you to continue participating in this ridiculous farce of a plan. I'm also concerned that you're involving yourself with such impractical, stupid people. You're going to be cleaning up their messes and \"helping them out\" in ludicrous situations indefinitely. You should take a stand now. If I were you, I'd leave her.", "These people do not see their time a valuable, which is not good, this med school couple sound kind of icky.", "They better get their butts in the car themselves, I have a feeling that\u2019s not going to happen.  I want an update to this whole thing!", "In my car: 27 hours at mostly highway speeds with a couple hours of breaks in that drive time is 1500 miles.  That\u2019s 46 gallons of gas for my small car, at $3.49/gallon, that\u2019s only $160.\n\nEven with a ridiculous truck nuts dangling pickup with 22 mpg highway it\u2019s about $237.  Twice that if they\u2019re pulling a trailer box.\n\nA mover would cost a heck of a lot more.\n\nBut.\n\nThe anguish of spending 27 hours in a car, packing a home, unpacking a home, and dogs in the car on the way back?  I\u2019d be happily donating plasma for a year in order to write a check to sister to hire movers instead of having to do that.", "No. You\u2019re not. Your GF is TA though and takes you for granted. Does she always treat you this way?", "Where are all these cheap movers? I\u2019m moving a studio apartment 6 hours away and quotes are coming in at $5k", "Little bit of a red flag, let's not sugar coat this now...", "Movers are not that cheap. We moved an 800 sq ft house across town 5 years ago and it was 2,600.", "It\u2019s cheaper to hire movers to move someone to their new place an hour away than it is to drive 27 hours round trip. Your quote is higher than the 27 hours round trip because you\u2019re moving 6 hours away and need to pay for the round trip gas and driving time on top of moving costs.", "I hear you Chimp but we don\u2019t know the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of this relationship. I will say this, I\u2019ve been married for 18 years and love my wife dearly but I\u2019d never travel 12 hours in a car with my in-laws to move my sister in law. Simple would never happen."]}
