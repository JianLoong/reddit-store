You did an incredibly nice thing agreeing to ride 13 hours (each way?) with her family and spending 3 days helping her sister move.\n\nNow your fiance is ditching you to ride back alone with her parents and two dogs while she flies back alone in comfort. You're getting played here.", "I don't even know **_WHO_** to be angry with here because:\n\n#13hrs driving to help someone *move locally* is \\* **RIDICULOUS** \\*\n\nFFS, **_hire_ some movers**.  \n\nAnd then to drive 13 more hours **_with_ TWO dogs**?!?\n\nThis sister had better cure cancer after all this shit.", "Nta. That's really unreasonable of her imo. You agreed to drive all that way to help her family for her to just ditch you before you come home? \n\nCan you fly back Sunday instead? \n\n13 hours is a long time to spend in a car with people you're not that close to.", "NTA. You went waaaay above and beyond for your fiancee's family and now she wants to ditch you for some fun time?! That's pretty insensitive.This may be your life after marriage. Better use those 13 hours to think about things.", "Info. Why did you all go there to help her and the bf move? Why couldn\u2019t they use a moving service?", "NTA. Flying back is obviously more comfortable and time-efficient so she's trying to choose the easier route. That's not fair since all of you rode together, so you must all drive back together as well.", "NTA. You did much more than anyone should expect a non family member to do. Secondly, I would be upset if I had to go on a 13 hour car ride with ANYONE.", "If you get along well with them what is the issue?", "YTA, you have to go home, well she doesn't. You have a good relationship with the parents, then explain your not feeling that up to a convo, but still don't mind small talk here or there. (Example, needs something like a rest stop) You just want a calm drive back. I'm assuming your fiance will not be visiting that often. From your comment about they will be fine without help, it makes me think she's just gonna miss her sister. Let her have some time, and just try to make the best of the situation. You could have phrased it better when talking to your fiance. \"I'm not feeling too social after all of this driving and helping, I feel drained and don't want to spend the next 13 hours feeling like I have to entertain people and socialize, is there anychance you could come back and maybe fly out another time.\"", "You pegged it in your explanation.\n\nOut on your big boy pants, you can deal with a car ride without her holding your hand. They are about to be your in laws, fella, and this is a big deal for you to drive a spell with them?\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s actually moving an hour away from our home so it\u2019s 14 hours back now..", "Trust me I expressed my frustration but i guess hiring movers is too expensive. I love her family and want to help out as much as I can, so I figured I\u2019d suck it up. But I also think that after doing this for my fianc\u00e9 and her family I deserve a ride home in comfort.", "She is planning on flying back Monday morning, so unfortunately it\u2019s not an option. Plus an extra expense that I think would be unnecessary when we can all just split gas on the drive home.", "They are in med school and too busy.

Yes that is where I am feeling like an asshole. Phrasing would help though, it was just surprising to me that she would even consider that. \n\nIn my defense I think after sacrificing my 4 day weekend to drive 13 hours and work 10 hour days moving her sister 1 hour away, just to drive back, I deserve a comfortable ride home.", "Lol, you are a completely deluded, condescending, disgusting loser.  Do the world a favor and curl up in a gutter somewhere and just let go of your pathetic life.", "She was planning on flying monday, plus both of us flying would be around 500 bucks, not worth the extra expense.", "> i guess hiring movers is too expensive. \n\nExpensive, sure, but only **_too_** expensive if you consider your family's time to be *worthless*.", "There would be no amount of money too great for me to avoid this hassle.

You do have to get home though so might just have to suck it up. \n\nNAH except maybe fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister and bf for not sorting out their own moving arrangements.", "Why did you agree in the first place? Did you think you get to be nice guy for only half the trip? It is a HUGE commitment to take this trip on. And not to mention, you\u2019re marrying into this family now. Don\u2019t be surprised if more of this pops up. Use this as a learning lesson, but now see your commitments through. \n\nFianc\u00e9 has every right to spend time with her sister during a big move while she\u2019s already busy to begin with and I\u2019m low key embarrassed that her own fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t see why this would be meaningful to her. Next time use your big boy words and say no to a future arrangement like this, or better yet, have a nice talk with her parents explaining that you need to leave asap and they need to find their own arrangement.

And I hate being the guy to persuade her from staying and extra day with her sister. I just think with the the amount of sacrifice I\u2019ve made this weekend, she can cut me some slack. \n\nThis was my 4 day weekend. I worked 2p-2am Thursday morning,  hopped in a car at 230am when I got home and started driving with the family. Now we drive back tomorrow and I go straight back work the next day.", "Maybe you should have stayed at home\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re starting to sound a bit assholeish now."]}
