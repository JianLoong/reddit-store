He didn\u2019t mention he was expecting anyone so when his friends turned up, I was caught off guard. I explained to them that my boyfriend wasn\u2019t home and that they could come back later but they wanted to wait inside for him. I\u2019ve known my boyfriend for a long time but we\u2019ve only been dating for a month so I haven\u2019t met all of his friends yet and I felt uncomfortable letting them in while he wasn\u2019t home.\n\nSo, I told them I couldn\u2019t let them in and they would have to come back. They asked me if I was serious and I told them yes and quickly shut the door because I didn\u2019t want to argue with them. \n\nMy boyfriend came back 20 minutes later and let them come inside since they were sitting outside in their cars. To say it was awkward would be an understatement. His friends kept joking about how I was like a frightened mouse and that I was acting like they were going to eat me. \n\nOne of his friends is also his cousin and while I\u2019ve seen him around my boyfriend, he\u2019s only ever said two words to me before. He was the most visibly annoyed that I had made them wait outside. I did apologise but he kept asking me what I thought they would do to me and he wouldn\u2019t drop it even after my boyfriend told him to shut up and leave me alone.\n\nMy boyfriend ended up kicking them out but even he thinks I should've let them in since I knew they were his friends.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695045819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lwgce/aita_for_making_my_boyfriends_friends_wait/", "score": 1201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Assuming your bf locks his doors and he wasn't home so they would have ???? sat in the car waiting for him to get home?", "NTA .. he didn't tell you they were coming over... you weren't familiar with them... he could have just as easily come back to them in your house and said he didn't feel comfortable with you letting them in because he might not have... it's weird how they made such a big deal of it.", "NTA\u2014I don\u2019t love that we live in a world where women feel the need to be as cautious as you were, but that is the one we live in. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about taking steps to protect yourself. \n\nI don\u2019t love that they mocked you and berated you for your actions; that says to me they are either grossly ignorant about SA culture or are disgustedly dismissive of it. \n\nAnd also, and I know this will stir up controversy, who cares that your boyfriend knows them? People get hurt by people they know all the time, the majority of the time even! \n\nStand up and say that you were taking steps to protect yourself. Don\u2019t let people wear you down into accepting situations you aren\u2019t comfortable in.", "Not. And as a man, I wouldn't be annoyed at either side. I wouldn't have minded waiting outside if I was visiting a friend who wasn't home and I wouldn't mind coming home to find my friends waiting outside because my girlfriend wouldn't let them in. Nobody should make a big deal about this really.", "So a bunch of people who are basically strangers to you showed up at the door, when you had no reason to expect them. And you told them they couldn't come in.\n\nSeems reasonable to me. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou don't really know them.  You had no heads up from your BF that company was coming.  You were home alone and at least 2 men showed up, unannounced.  Even if  you knew them, they don't get to be automatically let in just because they show up.\n\nIf your BF knew they were coming, then the biggest issue isn't them hassling you, it's your BF not telling you to expect company.", "NTA. It's your boyfriend's home and you don't know them well. There could have been any number of things they could have done before your bf got home that he or you wouldnt have liked, and he may not have wanted people inside while he's not home in the first place. It was up to him to notify beforehand.", "NTA!  It wasn't your place to open up, especially to people you don't know well.  Your bf should be glad you erred on the side of caution, especially after they made a big deal about it.\n\nI wouldn't even let my best friends into a place that wasn't mine.", "NTA. \n\nYou don't know them. If you were not there, they would have been sitting in their cars anyway so what is the problem? Then the fact that they kept bringing it up vs. respecting your decision it what really caused the issue.", "NTA\n\nMost of the friends I have that have gone through things like sexual assault etc has experienced it from people either they or their partners knew. One friend was raped by a man she met through her ex husband and who had been a close friend of hers for 20 years. \n\nIts true we shouldnt tar every man with the same brush and its very sad that they will feel upset by how you may have seen them. But its not a perfect world and you dont know them well enough. Hell even when you do you never know. But this was perfectly acceptable and guys need to understand that women have a different viewpoint in life that they often do.\n\nThe worst part is, imagine if something HAD happened? You get had a go at if you make them wait outside, but if you didnt and you get hurt, you then get people saying stupid victim blaming shit like 'she let a bunch of guys in that she doesnt even know?'\n\nWe are damned if we do. Damned if we dont. The liklihood of course is that nothing would happen. But as women we dont have the luxury to think that way.", "NTA. I believe that most men simply do not understand the level of fear that women carry around men. They will argue with you, laugh at you, and mock you for it, but then if you\u2019re attacked by a man, these same men will blame you for it by saying, \u201cwell, why did you let strange men into your house?\u201d", "Info: do none of you have working phones? Why not text the BF and ask if his friends were expected and what to do with them?", "And if you had let them in, and they stole your bf's stuff? Or hurt you? You didn't know all of them, they weren't expected, it isn't your house. Furthermore, they had a car to sit in. And guys who joke about women being timid around strange men are just encouraging rape culture. Or abusers themselves.\n\nYou're NTA, and your bf needs to rethink his priorities, because if your safety isn't first on the list, he can be dumped.", "NTA - I wouldn't let randos into someone else house either- like it's the 21st century people- They could have called the BF and have the BF call her or just wait like adults\n\nWhy would you shame someone who was uncomfortable with you - it's not going to make them like you anymore", "NTA, as a woman alone I perfectly understand you not wanting to be alone in the house with his friends, most of whom you do not know.\n\nYour safety & your fears are more important than his friends", "NTA - You didn't know these people at all.  And your BF didn't say or know they were coming over.  Most good people would understand your hesitancy and say thank you and wait outside.  I know I would have and have in the past in a similar situation.  So these friends of his are obnoxious jerks and its no wonder he kicked them out for their ongoing outrageous behavior towards you.  Good on him.", "NTA\n\nNot my house, I don't have instructions to let you in, you don't get in. That's it.", "NTA they may have been your boyfriends friends, but you didn't know them. It's totally understandable that you wouldn't be comfortable with several strange people in the house with you. Especially since they just showed up and you had no prior knowledge of them coming over.", "NTA\n\nYou were a good partner to your BF.\n\nIn addition to taking care of your own safety, to my view your decision also accomplished these results:\n\n* Stayed within your authority, in that BF didn't authorize you to admit anyone.\n* Protected the premises from a trespass.\n* Protected his stuff from theft or damage risk.\n* Stuck up for your own personal boundaries.\n\nI could easily imagine a scenario where one of these \"friends\" is the troublemaker of the group, unbeknownst to you.  Letting him in without BF present could have given him a platform for causing trouble or chaos, e.g. smoking inside, hiding things, eating important food, etc cet.", "NTA\n\nNot your place, not your decision whether to let them in. If it was that big a deal they could have called your boyfriend (assuming he has a cell phone) and gotten everything cleared up. It also isn't like you knew they were coming, and it seems your boyfriend didn't either. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou don't know them, you didn't call them then you have no reason to let them in. They are strangers after all. BF should've called them to tell them he will be 20min late so they can come later when he's back.  \n\n\nThem being bunch of jerks were just uncalled for.", "NTA. Your boyfriend should have been home to greet them. \n\nThe friends should have been OK waiting in their cars. Men need to be more thoughtful about situations like this and to defer to women in situations where their safety is the most important thing.", "Absolutely NTA. A big reason women remain vulnerable to attack by the unscrupulous is that men like your bf and his cousin make it clear that, if you were a good person, you would always, politely, remain vulnerable to men. See how that works? Then, should one of them prove unscrupulous, it\u2019s still your fault, they would blame you for not taking precautions and some might even say you invited it. Your bf and his cousin were evidently raised like that. Are you sure you feel safe around them?", "NTA\n\nYou didn't know who they were and you weren't told to expect guests. \n\n>I did apologise but he kept asking me what I thought they would do to me and he wouldn\u2019t drop it even after my boyfriend told him to shut up and leave me alone.\n\nBro.....I love when they play stupid. My safety trumps your convenience *every time*.", "NTA. I'm sorry they were so shitty to you after you're just trying to make a safe and responsible choice.\n\nNot that you should have to, but I'd suggest simply not answering the door at all if your man isn't home. They can decide what they want to do with their time, and you don't have to deal with an argument.\n\nMost of the time women end up hurt, it's by someone they are at least acquainted with. And probably all of his friends are cool, but if just one of them is the kind of person to make passes at you when dude's not around, that puts *you* in a bad spot. Even being honest about that kind of stuff can become a problem in your relationship with your man, because many dudes don't wanna have to pick a side (though the side there *should* be obvious!). Just consider yourself unavailable to the door. \n\nI feel like you made the best choice, and you weren't heard when you gave a reasonable explanation. If you find yourself not heard in this relationship a lot, keep track of that; it may not be the right place for you.", "> he kept asking me what I thought they would do to me\n\n\u2026interesting that this is where his mind went and this is what he\u2019s harping on. In my experience, dudes who get overly defensive about women keeping themselves safe are\u2026not great men. \n\nYou didn\u2019t know if bf would be ok with it. You respected his space until you could know and confirm his boundaries. NTA", "NTA - BF should have told randos where coming over so you could decide to be in a house alone with said randos", "NTA  \n\nYou could have been about to run out, take a shower, not in the mood to socialize, not wanting to let people into bfs place without his awareness, etc.  They immediately thought you were afraid that they would do something -which is a valid concern\u2026 especially since you just met them. I\u2019m sure they could rationalize that much too but they took it personal. It\u2019s weird that they would try to make you feel bad about it rather than attempt o become better acquainted.", "NTA\n\nYeah obviously if you don't know them, why would you want to be alone with them? You put your own safety first, the friends mocked you for it. Seems like crappy friends.\n\nI would have understood if I was the friend.", "NTA. Also his cousin and friends wouldn\u2019t know if you\u2019d ever been through anything traumatic, so the fact that they mocked you about being cautious is awful. It shows a total lack of regard and awareness of what statistically a significant percentage of women have experienced. I would absolutely hate to be around men like that.", "NTA It's fine you were uncomfortable and they were strangers.", "NTA. It's perfectly okay to not feel comfortable being alone with a bunch of men you don't know. I certainly wouldn't and a lot of women wouldn't.", "INFO: couldn\u2019t you have called them? Or couldn\u2019t *they* have called him?", "ESH. \n\n1.  Why didn\u2019t you call or text your boyfriend to see if he was cool with them coming in?\n\n2.  Why answer the door in the first place? It\u2019s not your house. \n\n3.  For closing the door in their faces. You could\u2019ve been more polite about it.\n\n4.  If bf knew about the visit, then he should\u2019ve told you.\n\n5. Friends should\u2019ve let it go, once the boyfriend got home. It was only 20 minutes.", "That's an old way. You're NTA. That's how is was done for thousands of years. Women wouldn't be alone with ANY other men that weren't her blood family. It left no room for doubt. That's what porches were for.", "Nah u did the right thing.", "You should have just called your bf . Since you don't really know anyone you don't know if they were planning to steal stuff etc or if they were on good terms.", "Hell to the no.\n\nYou don't know these guys from a hole in the wall.\n\nFor all you know, they thought your BF had left and they were going to rob him.  How pissed would your BF have been if you let people into his home he didnt want there simply because they claimed they knew him.\n\nIf anything, they could have easily called your BF and have him call you to tell you it's ok they are allowed to be there.  Instead, the poor things had to wait a few min in their car.  Did all of them survive?\n\nThey are wrong.. and so is your BF for agreeing with them.  Tell him next time a random stranger comes to the door and says they are his long lost uncle, you will let him in.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\nAbsolutely NTA, without a doubt.  And if your boyfriend doesn't back you up 100% on this then he is either an idiot or has no concern for your safety.  You did the right thing - don't let anyone tell you otherwise!", "NTA\n\n>  I felt uncomfortable letting them in while he wasn\u2019t home\n\nEnd of story. Clearly, none of them have any idea what the world can be like as a female, and the dangers involved.", "NTA, You didn't know them, you were outnumbered, you didn't know they were coming.\n\nBetter safe than sorry.", "Nope. NTA. Pretty woman taught us this lesson.", "NTA, there have been instances where this scenario has gone horribly wrong, better safe than sorry.", "NTA\n\nYou are a woman alone. Men you didn\u2019t know requested access to a private space with you. Your choice minorly inconvenienced them but in another situation could have protected you against a violent encounter. Your safety is more important than their convenience", "NTA.   \nHow lucky for men not to have to worry about their safety in the same vein women do. How wonderful their lives are to be so untouched by SA that they can joke and trivialise it. Urgh!", "NTA\n\nAll these YTA comments are wild. If something had happened to you,  these would be the same folks criticizing your decisions and telling you it could have been prevented.\n\nYes you could have called your BF but honestly he should've given you a heads up they were coming.", "ESH: assuming this is true\u2026 why didn\u2019t anyone call bf? I understand OP stated even if bf said to let them in she wouldn\u2019t, but at least that could be conveyed to bf and then to bf\u2019s friends. \u201cHey my gf isn\u2019t comfortable around people she doesn\u2019t know, can you wait 20mins for me to get back?\u201d Is that so hard? Learn to communicate.", "NTA. Just have better communication next time. A good lesson to have \u201chey, to prevent this again. Please let me know if you plan company when i may be here alone. I wan\u2019t to respect your space as I would hope you do mine\u201d", "NTA. When I\u2019m at my boyfriend\u2019s and he\u2019s not home, I\u2019ll only open the door to snatch a package that has arrived, or to take out the trash.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't know they were coming, didn't recognize many of them, and didn't feel comfortable. It's fair enough, and his friends are overreacting.\n\nIt's not like they had to wait for hours. It was 20 minutes. If you hadn't been there and the house was empty, they would have had to wait outside for him, anyway.", "NTA", "NTA this is BASIC common sense respect for another persons space. You do not let people in to other peoples houses under any circumstances. Was your boyfriend raised in a barn or what?\n\nI used to live in a house with 5 people plus 2 folks living in trailers in the back yard. One night, as I was getting in bed, someone came knocking on the door. It was 11pm and I had work the next day. Some chick is out there asking about her friend that lives in the backyard, saying she isnt home, when will she be home? The other housemates dog isnt letting her into the backyard to wait for her friend. Can she use the bathroom inside the house? Me: \"How the fuck should I know? She is an adult. I am an adult. I am not her keeper. It is 11pm why the fuck are you knocking on my door? No, you cannot come in, I got my ass out of bed to answer the door and Im not gonna wait for you to use the bathroom. Feel free to piss in the front yard or go to one of the many restaurants 4 blocks away. You have a phone, your friend has a phone. Figure it out. If she isnt answering, go away.\"", "NTA. So what, \"they were his friends\" - who HASN'T read/heard a story of a woman being attacked by \"friends\" of hers or her partner? \n\nBottom line - you weren't comfortable being alone with them. So you don't have to be.", "So some random dudes, one of whom you\u2019ve seen around your boyfriend and some of whom you\u2019ve never met before, claimed to be your boyfriend\u2019s friends and asked you to let them into his house, and people are claiming you\u2019re an AH? That\u2019s the recipe for a burglary: pretend to be someone authorized to go inside, then steal the person\u2019s stuff. Don\u2019t let strangers in the house is literally the first rule we teach young children about how houses work. If your boyfriend wanted to let these random dudes you didn\u2019t know in, he should have been home. NTA", "This is like the old \u2018my car broke down,can I come in and use your phone?\u2019 routine. Do none of these people own a cellular phone? They could have texted the BF who then could have texted you if it was cool for them to come in. That didn\u2019t happen,meaning that they were the rude ones,even if their intentions were innocent. \n\n NTA,and your BF should seriously consider upgrading his friend group.", "YTA.", "Gonna get down-voted to hell but YTA\n\nYou couldn't just call your bf and make sure people were coming over. Then let them in. Would've been handled in 30 seconds and you wouldn't look like a fucking weirdo lol They would understand too. Something like \"Hey, let me just check with bf. Can never be too careful\" and they wouldn't even have batted an eye.", "NTA, and I say this someone who, were I in the friends/cousins shoes, would be annoyed too. I'm a male that gets sensitive about how males can be perceived as threatening, and the expectations society sometimes places on us because of that.\n\nSo I'd be annoyed. But also, totally understanding. You were alone in your BFs place having only been dating for a month, so on top of not really knowing his friends well you probably also weren't feeling too comfortable in his place alone just in general, when some people you're not familiar with show up that your BF didn't tell you he was expecting. AND you knew he would be back pretty soon.\n\nSafest move is exactly what you did; tell them to wait outside for him to come back. Besides, imo, on their side I don't see a significant difference between waiting outside vs waiting inside, except waiting inside means awkwardly hanging around your buddy's new GF that you don't know well yet while you all wait for BF to come back.\n\nSo yeah, even though I think they were justified in at least being a little annoyed and possibly hurt, you're NTA and did what was the best and safest for you. Hopefully this is just a funny future story to laugh about later!", "The fact it was even an issue for them is A huge red flag. NTA", "NTA", "Nta, I wouldn\u2019t have even opened the door. I don\u2019t open the door for strangers and would have pretended not to be home. Boyfriend wasn\u2019t even there anyways.", "It's not only a matter of being cautious about your own safety (which is reason enough), but it's about it not being your place. For all you know, there's a problem with one of his friends helping himself to food or whatever. NTA.", "Nta.", "NTA. You didn't know them, they could have been lying. It sucks but that's the world we live in and the fact that they don't understand that just shows how ignorant and privileged they are.\n\nEdit: if the cousin brings it up again go ahead and say it, make him uncomfortable with facts. Tell him about what it's like being a woman around men who are strangers and what can happen if a woman trusts the wrong person. Absolutely fucking shame his ignorant ass.", "NTA. If you have no idea whether they're expected and aren't comfortable letting them in, having them wait out in their cars is fine.", "Definitely NTA! His friends were very freaking rude, they could have just go for a walk while waiting, instead they choose to be a pain in the ass. Your behavior was totally normal and your bf seems nice too, I just hope he changes such friends", "NTA and I'd show these comments to your bf.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is wrong, you don\u2019t know them.", "NTA- he should've let you know they were coming. I wouldn't have sat at my man's house with a bunch of guys I didn't know, either!! He was inconsiderate about you in this situation, and so was everyone else.", "NTA. Even ignoring that she's a woman and for her it is a safety issue, she's a guest in her boyfriends home. For all she knows this is a shitty friend he never lets in because he steals, or makes him uncomfortable. \n\nUnless I've been with a partner a long enough time to know I'm allowed to invite my own friends over and to know who they would let in then I'm not letting other people into a house uninvited.", "NTA -you live, you learn, and it seems his cousin needs to learn some manners. We women view the world vastly differently from how males do, and it's when we let our guard down that bad things can happen.\n\nI think you handled this situation fairly well. If you're the responsible party IN THAT MOMENT then it is your prerogative to protect his home -regardless of who was at the door. Repeat this to your BF and let him know that others out here are happy you exercised caution.", "NTA\n\nIf one of my buddies girlfriends asked me to wait outside because she didn't know me. I would totally understand. What I don't understand is how some men can't comprehend the logic of being cautious.", "NTA. But they were definitely acting like a-holes to give you a bad time about it. On top of that, they ignored your boyfriend, telling them to cut it out to the point he had to throw them out. They sound very immature, at best. And at worst, they simply don't respect women.", "NTA they could have been there to rob him they could have been there to rape you they could have done so many things. These things happen to people all the f****** time. Never ever let them in I don't care how embarrassing or awkward this was. They should have come back later, like you asked. How hard would it have been for them to hit up a gas station and go get a couple drinks while they waited instead of sitting there and acting like you're a bad guy for not just taking their word for it that they were expected company. And even if they were expecting company why do you have to be alone in a home with them?", "NTA - It\u2019s not your home. You don\u2019t need to be letting in people you don\u2019t know regardless of who they say they are.", "NTA, not even close. You were respecting the place that wasn't yours to allow people in. If your boyfriend was expecting them, it's his fault for not telling you to let them in. These friends honestly sound like the aholes.", "NTA. How hard would it have been for them to call/text your boyfriend and let him know they were coming, so you could have known as well?", "I have a daughter and her rule is no one strange gets in range. You did the right thing, trust your instincts, it\u2019s better to be wrong and apologize afterwards. The alternative doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.", "> since I knew they were his friends.\n\nBut, as you said, you didn't. You knew one of them. That's not enough to let the other, strangers to you, in the house.  \n\n\nHe should be glad you waited; if they had had ill intentions he for sure would have blame you for letting them in.  \n\n\nNTA.", "I was actually typing Y T A until I read your BF didn't tell you they were coming. Yeah you definitely did nothing wrong, dudes sometimes don't understand the extents we have to go to as women to protect ourselves.", "NTA as far as your bf friends concerned, they are as good as strangers since y\u2019all never met. They being assholes to you for not believing a completes stranger\u2019s word. It\u2019s the normal reaction", "NTA - not sure why anyone thinks they have a right to entering your residence when they have a tangential relationship at best. You did what I (32M) would have done in your situation. Fuck them for trying to make you feel bad or calling you a \"scared mouse\" they're just pissed because they couldn't get their way.", "NTA at all!\n\nI'm glad your BF was on your side and ultimately ended up kicking them out. \n\nThe world is a crazy place and you never know who you can trust. So good for you for looking out for yourself and also not being in a position with a bunch of other guys alone in a room without your BF to give the BF the wrong impression too. \n\nI think a simple conversation with your BF how you're not comfortable hanging with his friends when he's not there should suffice.

Why didn't they reach out to him? \n\nYou can never be too careful. One alone girl with a bunch of dudes you bearly know?
