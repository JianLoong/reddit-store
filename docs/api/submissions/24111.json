I have heard this before, the constant complaining about something in their life but never moving to make it better. Any suggestion to do so is met with either excuses of why it won't work or anger that you aren't being supportive.", "NTA\n\nyou reasons are pretty valid. If she's not ready to divorce/separate, ok her choice, but she's not entitled to live with you so it takes it to leave it situation. She's not in an emergency,she just wants to \"try out\" if she will be able to live without your father probably, but that would leave you used and probably with higher rent than you can afford. \n\nAlso if she decides to talk to you again, tell her to stop complaining about her marriage to you all the time, she can seek a professional marriage counselor for that, it seems to be stressing you out a lot.", "NTA. Anyone that asks you to light yourself on fire to keep them warm is the jerk, not you for refusing. If she cannot commit to contributing financially to your household then she can't move in with you.\n\nAlso, it's super weird that your mom is so dependent on you that she discloses that much about her marriage and thinks that she's entitled to live with you. I bet your BF is not fully comfortable with that plan, and I don't blame him. You deserve to have privacy with your BF. Your mom is an adult. Why is she relying on *you* rather than the other way around? She should figure out her own relationship and her own living situation rather than imposing on you. Actually, she shouldn't be asking to move in with you *even if* she was getting a divorce. Why can't she arrange to get her own place? She's your mother, not your child. Yet she's asking you to serve as her mother.\n\nI say this from a place of deep sympathy, OP, but your mom sounds like a narcissist and/or emotionally immature. I cut my mom off because she was the same way. She did not work, got me way too involved in her money issues, and then expected me to support her when she made mistakes. I looked back over my life and realized she never was there for me when I needed it, but I was always expected to be there for her. She also *hated* my dad and basically ruined my relationship with him for 30 years by telling me lies. So I cut her off after she absolutely *flipped out* at my attempts to set healthy boundaries. Now I have a great relationship with my dad and she's not blowing up my phone because she's in her 60s and so immature she can't figure out how to call AAA and have someone change her car battery when it dies.\n\nSounds like you need boundaries, OP. Because her request isn't normal. Neither is the degree she's involving you in her own relationship.", "I highly recommend the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C Gibson, it'll help explain her behaviour, your feelings, and your relationship dynamic.\n\nNTA", "NAH.  You can explain why you made that request -- bc you can't afford it if she changes her mind.  However, there are reasons people stay married.  For whatever set of reasons, they're not quite ready to get divorced.\n\nIn your shoes, I would plan on a place I can afford without my mother's financial contribution.", "NTA and she\u2019s trying to make you responsible for her financial and emotional well-being. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your mom has been parentifying you for quite a while now.\n\nWhat she\u2019s doing isn\u2019t right. Besides burdening you, she\u2019s putting a burden on your boyfriend too. Don\u2019t let her move in if you value your relationship with him.", "NTA she just wants a place to escape to when they have fights but doesn\u2019t want to responsibility of paying to have it", "NTA. You can always decide whether or not to accept a family member as a tenant (for that's what they become, whether or not there is payment involved), for any reason. And you should make decisions financially on your own apartment that make sense for YOU.\n\nHowever, it is not your role to arbitrate your parents' marriage. Ultimately, your mom (and dad) are grown adults, and especially your mother may have financial or other reasons to stay with your dad. Your mom may be trying to \"have her cake and eat it too,\" or just starting her own process of leaving the marriage, but it would make far more sense for you to be a loving daughter and not tie all this to her being your tenant/roommate and/or the legal \"push\" factor. It could erode your relationship with one or both parents.\n\nIf you are upset with your mom for complaining about her marriage, you need to set stronger boundaries on that. There's a way to lovingly say \"Mom, I love you, but I don't want to hear you complain about Dad anymore and we need to talk about something else.\"", "No not at all", "NTA\n\nYour home lease can't be her trial separation test run.  If she's not committed to divorce, then you can't commit to paying for a place for her to live.", "Yes, exactly this. Like another comment, I probably should ask her nicely to stop complaining about him to me", "I agree. Being asked to suddenly start a divorce process after 20+ years I\u2019m assuming is difficult even if she wants to be divorced. She\u2019s not wrong for those feelings and OP isn\u2019t wrong to look out for their financial future.", "Exactly, she is dragging you in and then making you the bad guy. That is not acceptable. Congrats on your move!", "NTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But: Have you even asked your partner if he is ok with your mom moving in?**", "INFO\n\n> I told her, I\u2019d be okay with that\n\nCleared FIRST with your boyfriend?", "NTA", "NTA- You need to protect yourself if she leaves and goes back to her husband. Your father.\n\nThat she hasn't brought up again means she knows that's a possibility.   You are not a trial run for her to try living semi-independently.", "NTA", "She obviously did not expect to have to contribute.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore like a nice holiday, where you paym cleen and cook for her, and pamper her.", "Agree. Parents shouldn't involve their children in their relationship that much. It's damaging.", "Oh man... I did this song and dance with my parents. My dad talking about divorce since 2002, my mom being volatile (multiple mental health and personality issues) and blaming me. My dad moved about 15 storage bins into my apartment when I was in my early 20s. He continued to whine about my mom. He used my grad school graduation to trap my inlaws for about 2 hours talking about his impending divorce and made that miserable. I finally told him he wasn't going to use my wedding to announce his divorce and I didn't want my mother there (incredibly abusive). I told him to shit or get off the pot, we were all tired of hearing it and I didn't want to be his therapist anymore. He and my brothers went out of their way to ruin my wedding day to \"put me in my place\" and \"show me who the boss is\"\n\nTurns out I was raised by two narcissists. I went NC with both of them. \n\nNTA. but I think you should see a therapist and get some space. This isn't healthy, seems enmeshed, and isn't sustainable for your happiness.", "NTA. This sounds exactly like my parents and their subsequent 8 year divorce. You aren't the A H pretty much no matter what you do in this situation, she is being one to herself. Life after the divorce is so much better for everyone in my family. I'm sorry you are going through this/have spent 27 years with your parents clowning around", "Agreed. Your it your mom's friend your her daughter. She shouldn't complain to you in the first place. And you shouldn't be put in a position where she relies on you for moving out. She's a grown woman. Let her get her own place"]}
