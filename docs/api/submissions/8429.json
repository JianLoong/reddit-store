A single top from those kind of places can run almost $80+ where as I was able to buy enough pieces for a whole weeks wardrobe - with no repeats - from Shein for about $100. \n\nDoes it feel shitty to have to use a company you know isn't great? Yeah absolutely. But when your choices are; save up for few months to afford one piece, or save a few months and afford a whole wardrobe, then you do what you gotta do.\n\nOP you are so far from being TA, but your (hopefully ex) boyfriend sure is!

However if I order a dish vegetarian and the server brings me a plate with chicken on it ... that animal is already dead. Me sending it back or throwing away the meat isn't going to make it any less dead or improve the conditions it lived in before it died.
