He then tells me that I can go home unless I throw my coat away because he can't be with someone who is that ignorant, whether it is a gift or not and that my supervisor is probably 'just as stupid as me'.

He sounds abusive for yelling at you for something out of your control.", "NTA let\u2019s face it we all know it\u2019s wrong to buy that type of brand but throwing it away at this point is just plain wasteful.

The boyfriend is a problem. And while Shein may be unethical, throwing the coat away doesn\u2019t solve a problem, and if he really cared about it that much, he\u2019d buy you a replacement coat.", "While Shein is absolutely unethical, for some they're the only choice, which could absolutely be a part of it here. We have no idea what the supervisors finances are like, and to some people who struggle financially buying \"high quality\" ethical clothing isn't possible, so you do what you have to.\n\nI'm a bigger person, so to buy clothing anywhere is usually ridiculously expensive, even more so if I try to shop at \"ethical\" plus sized stores. A single top from those kind of places can run almost $80+ where as I was able to buy enough pieces for a whole weeks wardrobe - with no repeats - from Shein for about $100. \n\nDoes it feel shitty to have to use a company you know isn't great? Yeah absolutely. But when your choices are; save up for few months to afford one piece, or save a few months and afford a whole wardrobe, then you do what you gotta do.\n\nOP you are so far from being TA, but your (hopefully ex) boyfriend sure is! Fast fashion is shitty, sure, but if you take care of your clothes, they can last a long time too! I still have a few pieces I bought from Shein when it first came into mainstream and there's no sign of wear and tear at all, even with frequent use.", "LMAO. Right? Does he have a phone? A car? Eat chocolate? Eat meat? Shop at a business that uses phones, cars & trucks, or sells chocolate? \n\nHe is massively full of shit. \n\nOur world is inherently unethical and we live at a time where extremely bad labor practices are being used to secure resources that are being used in the developed world at an enormous cost to the developing world. But rejecting a gift from Shien is literally no different than any other ethical decision. \n\nOP's (hopefully ex)BF is a toolbag of massive, epic proportions.", "This is the way and I absolutely refuse to believe he threw you out over a philosophical debate on the environment.

That is super controlling of him, and it was a gift, it's not like you bought from them.", "He's done you a HUGE favor.\n\nLets set aside the issue of you didn't pick the retailer that you got the coat from.  Under no circumstances should a loved one call you stupid or yell at you in the way your BF did.  He's being VERY unreasonable, even if we assume that his underlying point is correct he's going about it in a very negative way and is just not how you treat people.

His food, his clothing, his electronics, his cleaning supplies, etc.\n\nIf not, then why is fast fashion where he draws his \"ethical\" line?", "NTA.
