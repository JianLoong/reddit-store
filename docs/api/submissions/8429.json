A single top from those kind of places can run almost $80+ where as I was able to buy enough pieces for a whole weeks wardrobe - with no repeats - from Shein for about $100. \n\nDoes it feel shitty to have to use a company you know isn't great? Yeah absolutely. But when your choices are; save up for few months to afford one piece, or save a few months and afford a whole wardrobe, then you do what you gotta do.\n\nOP you are so far from being TA, but your (hopefully ex) boyfriend sure is!

Kicking someone out when they've traveled to see you especially is a dick move.", "He did you a favor by throwing you out. Don't go back NTA", "Controlling, demanding... you WANT THIS MAN in your life?", "Well you did what he asked you and made the right decision - you went home, and have not reached out. Well done. He\u2019s an abusive person. Throwing you out into the cold for that? \nNTA. Steer clear of such people.", "NTA\n\nBf sounds exhausting\u2026", "Your boyfriend is a massive jerk. NTA. Ditch that guy", "NTA Your (hopefully ex-) boyfriend is tho", "Her boyfriend called her stupid. Who needs that in their life? He sounds controlling and verbally abusive, which often escalates to controlling and physically abusive.", "Also, just about every clothing manufacturer is unethical. It is in no way limited to Shein. You can pretty much guarantee he's also wearing something made by a worker in a sweatshop.\n\nThere's no ethical consumption.", "Not only that, he threw her out of his apt in the cold rather than have an adult conversation about his big feelings. \n\nDon\u2019t look back on this guy.", "Also, she didn\u2019t buy it. \n\nIf it\u2019s a gift or thrifted why stress?", "And insult her and her supervisor and throw her out because she didn't make \"the right decision\" - a decision HE made for her. \n\nOP, you're NTA but think about how your boyfriend treated you. It sounds like he's looking down on you.", "It's already been bought; the damage is done. While you wouldn't want to support the brand, the responsible thing to do would be to keep it and wear it, I'd think.", "Agree NTA. It's also shitty to call her and her supervisor stupid.", "Apple literally has suicide nets surrounding their factories so the workers can't jump.", "He\u2019s acting like Shein is the only unethical company. Obviously it\u2019s not ok and we should all be trying our best not to support these practices, throwing the coat away is worse. And he likely supports a gazillion companies that do equally bad things. Going nuclear about a gift is insane", "I second this! And as me-specific add on point, because my size changes frequently, Shein or it\u2019s sister company, Emrey Rose are really the only places I can afford to buy clothing from that fits my style (and quite frankly my age), and is also work appropriate.\n\nWhether you want to admit it or not, having options outside of places like Shein and Emery Rose is a privilege that not everyone has.", "OMG! I thought I was gonna be burnt at the stake!\n\nInstead we found someone having the same experience \ud83e\udd17 SO MUCH YAY !!\n\nI'm 57. They have stuff I've wanted to have since I was 16!\n\n& post divorce naughty clothes YAY!\n\nSHEIN clothing has been such a huge part of my healing and being myself & finding my sassy, & yay!\n\n\"For $10!\"\n\nMy friends now answer their own compliments, \"You look amazing, SHEIN? $15 or less?\" \ud83e\udd23", "I'm a vegetarian too and I agree with you completely.", "I think it's PETA and those militant types that ruin the rep for all of us unfortunately.\n\nUpvoted btw"]}
