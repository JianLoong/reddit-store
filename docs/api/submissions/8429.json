My supervisor (who is awesome and everyone loves her) remembered me saying that I wanted a royal blue peacoat (my favorite color) but was not able to find one that I liked. Well she apparently got me for Secret Santa and when I opened my gift it was a blue peacoat from Shein and I was so happy that she remembered such a small detail about me and I've honestly been wearing it every day because I love it so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell fast forward to last week, my boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship (he lives about 4.5 hours from me) and I went to go and visit him. All is fine and dandy until he discovers my coat is from Shein and it turns into a huge argument. He started yelling at me about how can I be so selfish to wear something that is fast fashion and don't I know that Shein uses cheap slave labor and that the people who make the clothes are abused in the sweatshops they work in under terrible condtions. I tell him that the coat was a gift from my supervisor. He then tells me that I can go home unless I throw my coat away because he can't be with someone who is that ignorant, whether it is a gift or not and that my supervisor is probably 'just as stupid as me'. I tell him that it's cold outside and that I'm not going to throw my coat away and that I don't shop on Shein anyway and he ends up kicking me out of his apartment and to reach out to him again once I've made the right decision. I ended up going back home and haven't reached out since.

But please, be kind and loving to yourself and do not attempt to stay with this man. You deserve better than being with someone who treats you like that. What you have described is a huge red flag.", "Nta. I agree that Shein is a no go. But it\u2019s even more wasteful if you throw it away now. \nYour boyfriend sounds like a dick. Manipulative as well. \n\nYou already made the right decision! Don\u2019t go back to him.", "NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend is right about the fast fashion industry but he definitely did not need to take it out on you, as it was a gift. \n\nHe sounds like a jerk tbh, I'd throw him out and keep the coat instead.", "NTA.  If you're an A about anything, it's about not breaking up with this controlling bf then and there.     There may be valid arguments about buying from countries that exploit labor, but his demand is way out of line, and even if you felt the same way, throwing away what is thought to be a thoughtful gift from your boss would be idiotic.", "NTA.\n\nWhat he's saying is true, but this is pretty much how almost every single industry where manufacturing is involved works. Wait until he discovers his phone was most likely manufactured at Foxconn.\n\nLet's not forget however that you weren't even the one who bought it. He doesn't sound like a good bf -or a good person in general- if he gets angry over this of all things.", "NTA. Why is he acting like you paid for it or made the decision to buy and support the company? \n\nAlso if you\u2019re in a LDR 4.5 hours apart, he sounds like a moron for picking a fight over that, because you can easily just cut ties with him.\n\nGuarantee he has some clothes/shoes from companies that have similar issues", "NTA- Shein is ethically a shit company but in this case it is utterly beside the point. \nKicking you out of his apartment because you refused to throw away something that offended him?\nRun. Or rather don't contact him ever again. \nGood news is he showed you early on what a controlling AH he was.", "You. NTA\n\nHim. Major AHOLE.  \n\nUmmm run girl. He\u2019s getting this mad about a coat? Imagine what other things will tick him off in the future that he kicks you out in the cold again.", "Yeah, your BF has issues. Ultimatums are never cool. Insults are never cool and him calling you stupid is verbal abuse.\n\nDump him. NTA", "BF made this big a ruckus over a coat? Sounds like he was looking for a reason to end things with you. Specifically calling you ignorant and stupid? Those are huge red flags. That tells you exactly what he thinks of you and his level of respect for you.\n\nEnjoy the nice warm coat. By not reaching out to him, you've definitely made the right decision.\n\nNTA", "NTA, throwing away the coat isn't going to magically fix slave labor used to make it. *If it bothers you* it might be best to bring it up with your supervisor that you appreciate the coat, but Shein isn't an ethical company to buy items from. Also, leave the boyfriend. He sounds abusive for yelling at you for something out of your control.", "NTA let\u2019s face it we all know it\u2019s wrong to buy that type of brand but throwing it away at this point is just plain wasteful. Mainly tho thank goodness he showed his true colours before you ended up married to him. Ditch the BF not the coat.", "NTA - It not his coat and sounds like if he wants to go off at you for that then he one who what ever you wear could trigger it. Call it a near miss of what is to come. Does he wear pure ethically made stuff?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You\u2019re not supporting the slave labor and sweatshops. You didn\u2019t even buy the coat. \n\nYour bf is a jerk for being that ridiculous and insensitive about expecting you to go without a winter jacket in the cold. Aside from that, ultimatums and guilt trips and silent treatments are a form of manipulation. Manipulation is a form of emotional abuse. He\u2019s emotionally abusing you. I\u2019d say that\u2019s far more serious of a problem for you. \n\nHis abuse is still abuse and not much better than the abuse that he is so upset about with slave labor and sweatshops. Abuse is abuse.", "NTA unless you plan to stay with him. He called you stupid, kicked you out, and told you not to contact him again until you acquiesce to his demands ie make \"the right decision\"... ugh, so much eye roll here! Dump him! He will always steamroll right over your opinions and feelings if you stay with him. Enjoy your new coat! :-)", "It\u2019s a gift!

Look, yes shein has unethical labor and environmental practices. But you as one human being accepting one piece of clothing as a gift from a supervisor are not changing that, and you even said that you don\u2019t shop from there yourself.\n\nThat\u2019s not even the biggest issue though - the big issue is that your boyfriend\u2019s reaction is over the top and abusive. If your choices are the coat or the boyfriend, you picked the better option.", "NTA\n\nYour bf sounds like a proper righteous prick tho.", "NTA keep coat. Throw away BF", "NTA. Dump his ass", "NTA. It is your coat and your life. He is being controlling and while on a ethical scale he could have a point, he doesn't have a right to police your situation. Also it would put you in a massively awkward situation at work.", "NTA\n\nWhile many people have issues with fast fashion, your boyfriend was unbelievably rude and inconsiderate to you. Break up with him, keep the coat.", "Toss the boyfriend out. I understand the fast fashion thing but it is much more important to be mindful of the things you already have. Now I do shop locally but I also have products from amazon or shein that I bought long ago. I have already bought those things so throwing them out wouldn't change anything. Fast  fashion is dangerous. Don't wear something once and then throw it out.\n It was a gift.\nOP can't control what she got or where the gift was bought from. The boyfriend is taking this too far. \nNTA", "NTA and run like the wind. That man is off his meds. He was looking for something to be upset about and I think he wanted to see how much control he has over you. He Is TAH.", "Your boyfriend is abusive, high-handed, and obnoxious.

Keep the coat dump the boyfriend he sounds like a controlling AH", "people who buy a few items from shein aren\u2019t even the problem anyways when it comes to buying fast fashion. the people who do those massive hauls where they buy like $600 worth of a ton of items are the one abusing it. people who buy a few items because they cannot afford to buy from a more expensive and better company really are not the problem. also, throwing out the coat wouldn\u2019t solve anything, it\u2019s already paid for and you would just be wasting clothing. bf needs to get off his high horse. NTA", "NTA. Shein is filth and the excuses people make for their Shein hauls make my skin crawl. But you didn\u2019t buy the coat and throwing it away isn\u2019t going to solve a single thing. Unless he was offering to replace it with something he considered ethically made his demand and actions were outrageous. Dump that loser, keep your coat and live a happy life.", "NTA. Dump his self-righteous, manipulative & verbally abusive ass.", "NTA. As well as thanking her for the gift, please also remember to thank your supervisor for helping you dodge a bullet.", "I am so sorry to hear about your soon to be ex boyfriend being stupid but you are NTA", "You are entirely right. The boyfriend is a problem. And while Shein may be unethical, throwing the coat away doesn\u2019t solve a problem, and if he really cared about it that much, he\u2019d buy you a replacement coat.", "While Shein is absolutely unethical, for some they're the only choice, which could absolutely be a part of it here. We have no idea what the supervisors finances are like, and to some people who struggle financially buying \"high quality\" ethical clothing isn't possible, so you do what you have to.\n\nI'm a bigger person, so to buy clothing anywhere is usually ridiculously expensive, even more so if I try to shop at \"ethical\" plus sized stores. A single top from those kind of places can run almost $80+ where as I was able to buy enough pieces for a whole weeks wardrobe - with no repeats - from Shein for about $100. \n\nDoes it feel shitty to have to use a company you know isn't great? Yeah absolutely. But when your choices are; save up for few months to afford one piece, or save a few months and afford a whole wardrobe, then you do what you gotta do.\n\nOP you are so far from being TA, but your (hopefully ex) boyfriend sure is! Fast fashion is shitty, sure, but if you take care of your clothes, they can last a long time too! I still have a few pieces I bought from Shein when it first came into mainstream and there's no sign of wear and tear at all, even with frequent use.", "LMAO. Right? Does he have a phone? A car? Eat chocolate? Eat meat? Shop at a business that uses phones, cars & trucks, or sells chocolate? \n\nHe is massively full of shit. \n\nOur world is inherently unethical and we live at a time where extremely bad labor practices are being used to secure resources that are being used in the developed world at an enormous cost to the developing world. But rejecting a gift from Shien is literally no different than any other ethical decision. \n\nOP's (hopefully ex)BF is a toolbag of massive, epic proportions.", "This is the way and I absolutely refuse to believe he threw you out over a philosophical debate on the environment. He picked a fight for some other reason. Please don\u2019t waste your time with someone who would behave so badly and treat you like you\u2019re less just because of a coat. NTA", "Exactly! Throwing it away now benefits no one. The labor has already been done. NTA", "yes, if you find out you that somethin you got or bought is actually a product that was made unethically. Do not throw it away, but find a way to compensate for the damage that has been done. For instance by donating the equal amount to a charity fighting child labor", "Agreed entirely! Great points.", "She should however throw the whole boyfriend away."]}
