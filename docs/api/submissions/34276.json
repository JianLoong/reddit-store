We drove around forever before finally seeing one spot and immediately beelined for it, but when we go to pull in we see a kid (10 or 11 years old) just standing in the middle of it. I roll my window down to see what she\u2019s doing there and she immediately starts yelling \u201csorry can\u2019t park here, the spot is taken\u201d. I was confused because I saw no sign of a car or her parents anywhere. I super calmly and nicely said \u201csorry kid, you can\u2019t take a parking spot by standing in it\u201d. The kid ignores this and keeps reciting the same thing as before, which is clearly a script given by her parent who told her to stand there. At this point I was admittedly starting to get pissed because a) we had been looking for parking forever, b) everyone knows it\u2019s a dickhead move to stand in a spot to \u201creserve\u201d it and c) I knew there was a jerk parent who was the real instigator of the situation, and a pretty big part of me didn\u2019t want the parent to get their way. One more time I decided, with a little more assertiveness, to say \u201chey, you really need to move out of the parking spot now\u201d. At this point she goes \u201ccan I stay here? Please?\u201d. This is where I did feel pretty bad for her but I put on a nice voice and just said \u201cI\u2019m sorry but no\u201d, at which point she stomped her way out of the spot and we pulled in. \nNext thing I know this lady comes raging towards our car and starts banging furiously on my window. I roll it down and immediately start getting screamed at with her saying \u201chow dare you ask my daughter to move, this spot was taken. She\u2019s crying her eyes out in the car now and it\u2019s your fault. I\u2019m gonna report you to management for taking our parking spot\u201d. She then pulls out her phone and starts taking pictures of everything - of me and my friend, our lisence plate, different angles of our car. This went on for at least 20 minutes, with my friend and I calmly trying to talk to her and this lady absolutely RAGING at us the whole time. After a while she eventually just drove off, we were never contacted by the resort and heard nothing further. \nDid I handle the situation poorly? \nOn the one hand, the kid was a bit older like I said, and I spoke nicely and calmly to her the whole time, never raised my voice. We purposely kept the car in the lane the whole time and never tried to advance into the spot, since I knew that would scare her. I always assumed the reason the mom was SO mad was because deep down she knew that she never should have asked her daughter to do that, and she felt guilty so she took it out on me instead. \n\nOn the other hand I felt pretty horrible about the fact that apparently she cried after. Maybe I should have just never engaged with her at all and realized it was a battle I shouldn\u2019t have fought in the first place?", "created_utc": 1704324893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xxrw1/aitah_for_asking_a_10_year_old_kid_to_move_from_a/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s most likely due to the fact that she\u2019s afraid of the consequences she might face due to moving and succeeding. Mom sounds like she could be a bit harsh and if I was the kid I might react similarly. I don\u2019t think it was wrong to ask her to move either. This is a great lesson, that apparently her mother isn\u2019t teaching (or rather teaching the opposite) that 1) we don\u2019t always get what we want and 2) parking lot etiquette frowns upon using a body block to reserve a space and if you decide to do it, you might get into an uncomfortable social situation and 3) just because we feel entitled doesn\u2019t mean we are deserving.", "100% the daughter was crying because the mother yelled at her and berated her for moving and allowing you to park there. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Adults who do this -- or would have their child do this by proxy -- are obnoxiously entitled. You do not get to reserve a spot by standing in it or placing something in it. Period. As long as OP wasn't being aggressive in trying to get the kid to move (like revving the engine or creeping closer), I would consider this an instance of a kid being educated in what is/isn't okay, and an entitled parent who didn't get their way. And while I kind of don't believe the kid actually was crying -- that sounds like a very convenient exaggeration from the mom -- being assertive is not the same thing as being aggressive, and sometimes kids learn common etiquette and social rules from non-parental adults. This is how life works. It just sucks for the kid that their parent is such an ass.", "NTA.\n\nWho uses their kid as a parking spot saver?\n\nWho bangs on someone's window?\n\nAn asshole, that's who.", "NTA\n\nThe only asshole for miles here is that entitled and unhinged parent. They made the girl cry, not you. They can try to reserve a spot this way as long as other people let them.

Mom for putting her child in that situation and you for intimidating the child to give up the spot. Spots are first come, first served. If you reserve it with your body for a car just round the corner, fine with me. Also, it was a kid (which yes, plays in to mom\u2019s hands, but life is not always black and white). So you got your space and maybe the kiddo misses skiing. And cries. Happy holidays.", "NTA - You created a lesson. Don't pawn the safety of your child in order to park a vehicle.

I\u2019d have walked off after ONE minute.\n\nThe fact that the kid there suggests that the mum had left her there for a minute. Why? It\u2019s a crazy busy day and mum has left her 10yr old (barely old enough to stand up for themselves, as evidenced by what happened) in a parking lot at the snow\u2026 is Mum dropping a disabled relative off at the entrance (and hoping to get a close enough spot to collect them easily at the other end of hte day), is mum a raging narc who is forcing child to do weirdly odd things for her own pleasure (maybe, but putting the kid under the spotlight doesn\u2019t help matters), or was there a spot, a long crawl of slow traffic, and mum sent kid across a row of parked cars to stand in it until she could get to it?\n\nTwo of those scenarios make you the AH, one makes you a bit the AH. 2.5 out of 3 the AH in my mind. ESH. Mum shouldn\u2019t use a kid as a blocker (or given her a better script \u201cMum\u2019s dropping grandpop at the door and coming back here.

The little girl will be fine", "NTA in a lot of places parking spots are considered in the same light as roadways meaning that pedestrians can be ticketed for being in the parking space blocking them... So in no way do I ever consider it fair for someone to stand, sit, etc in a parking spot to save them because they are not meant for a person, only meant for a car with a driver to drive into and then for a driver to drive out of. No saving them by a person without a vehicle for someone else. Don't have a vehicle, get out of it, plane and simple, even if it's not a law or regulation in your area.

Did she leave her kid there to go some where the WTF", "Honestly I think you should have let her stay but NTA. I only say you should have let her stay because my mom was like this and if I moved I would have been in trouble and actually been punished which would definitely make me upset and cry when I told my mom I was \u201ckicked out\u201d which only slightly helps my case and I would still get punished just not a lecture too.
