You told them you have no interest in babysitting, having done it before with your cousins. They disrespected your wishes as they continued to call repeatedly and asking constantly for you to babysit. It was time to set a boundary, even if you had to do it harshly. They couldn't listen with your wishes when you put it simply. So aggression had to be taken. At day's end, their new child is their responsibility.

You've told them you don't give a shit about them or their child, and did so in no uncertain terms. Your comfort is more important than trying to help out and always will be. You couldn't care less.\n\nNow you're going to get a child-free experience, but probably also a parent-free experience. Hope you never have an emergency and have someone to turn to.

That\u2019s just cold, man.", "NTA. so much of this story is honestly\ndepressing. it\u2019s sad that 2 middle aged adults are full time workers and are still unable to easily afford child care. imo it shouldn\u2019t even be a question that they can afford that. it\u2019s also sad that they\u2019re having a kid so late in life. he\u2019s probably going to have most of his relatives die while he\u2019s still fairly young. what\u2019s done is done, but his life is going to be harder for sure.\n\nbut you aren\u2019t responsible for the economy nor your parents decision to have another kid. and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to form a bond with him either. any chance at a sibling relationship between you two was lost when your parents tried turning bonding time into charity case. it turns your little brother into work and a burden you have no desire for and only further ostracized you from him. you\u2019re lucky that you\u2019re an adult and can easily turn them down. had you still been living there they definitely would\u2019ve forced parenthood on you. i\u2019m glad you\u2019re remained firm, hopefully they learn to respect your wishes! \n\ni would also like to suggest giving them a little bit of emotional leeway! for 9 months now neither of them have probably had much sleep and are both incredibly overworked and getting older. a lot of people become very desperate for reprieve and i doubt either of your parents are their best selves. if they don\u2019t normally act this way, then it\u2019s probably sleep deprivation talking. just keep sticking to your boundaries and ride the wave until things calm down!", "NAH\n\nYou have a right to your choice here. \n\nBut you were also kinda harsh. I mean, they ARE your parents, and this IS your little brother. \n\nI have to admit that I really don't understand why so many people are so against watching their cousins/siblings or demanding pay for it?\n\nMy older cousin never got paid for watching my sister and me. I never got paid for watching my sister's kids. \n\nSeems to me like family ought to be helping family, y'know?

I'm assuming at their age it wasn't intended. I would also argue, would it kill the OP to sacrifice a tiny bit of his free time to make them extremely grateful and help them get some rest?\n\nWhether or not you want a relationship with your brother is not the issue for me, its how much of a good son are you willing to be for your parents?\n\nBeing a parent myself, if my son came at me like you did in this scenario.

Don't fuck up your relationship for life. This baby is another being, your sibling. I'm not sure why you are so keen to write off any relationship with them when you have the opportunity to be someone for somebody else, perhaps it's too much pressure and you are not ready for the responsibility. \n\nThe way you spoke to your parents was unnecessary...yes they keep asking because they are DESPERATE.", "NTA You set a boundary that they keep crossing. Perhaps next time don't be so harsh with people.\n\nI would also wait regarding your brother, while the age gap is big he is ultimately still your brother and you may love him once he is old enough to form his character. First give a chance and try and then make decisions based on experience. Otherwise you may miss on some things.", "NAH. \n\nI think it's reasonable when people ask other family members to do them the *occasional* favor of looking after a child so they can get a little break. Babies are exhausting. \n\nIt's also reasonable to say no. \n\nSlight YTA lean for snapping at them, but I can also understand the frustration with dealing with repeated requests, though there are better ways to set boundaries.", "Not the asshole, but also not not the asshole. This is your brother, and although your parents chose to have a newborn you should offer to spend time with your brother. This is for your relationship rather then a babysitter relationship. If you\u2019re not comfortable when he\u2019s 9months old, I hope you would consider once he can start recognizing you. This would be to preserve your relationship rather then babysitting. Obviously, with you grown, out of the house responsibilities change, you shouldn\u2019t be expected to babysit.

Especially when it comes to infants, not everybody is comfortable watching them.\n\nHowever, I feel like there is more going on here.\n\n- You say that your parents are burnt-out and desperate for help, and yet you not only refuse to help them every single time but even state that you will never help them in the future.\n- You say that you don't want any kind of relationship with your brother. \n- You even go as far as saying \"stop asking or stop calling\".\n\nYour post almost reads like you have been an only child for 20 years, and suddenly having a brother has shifted your relationship with your parents. Is it possible that you are jealous? Or has your relationship with your parents been bad before your brother was born?

Great perspective \ud83d\udc4c.", "The stories here mostly involve the kinds of parents who dump their kids on family members, demand that person gives up their freedoms and life, often don\u2019t ask for permission before putting responsibility on them, or parents asking siblings to bear the burden of parenting siblings to the detriment of their own growth. \n\nIt\u2019s never cute baby, maybe shared with a cousin sitting it\u2019s unreasonable.  Free childcare is not an expectation it\u2019s a gift should be done freely.", "It's not about money, they offered to pay and I still said no.

It took awhile to build a relationship with her (she was married and starting her family by the time I was 5), she is NC with our parents and a few other familial traumas. But we\u2019re both glad to have each other now. Your brother won\u2019t be one forever. Your relationship is yours to dictate, but you can absolutely have a positive one with him one day.", "You do it like you would with a puppy: you build trust, by being a little silly with it, you both laugh & learn toappreciate each other gradually.\nHe\u2019ll learn fun stuff from you, youll have a little fun being goofy as you show him new stuff. It builds over time. Start real slow & you could build a relationship that becomes important to you both.  Start slow, not hours at a time,  if you decide you want to.", "Spoiler: he won't be a one year old forever.", "It won\u2019t be like siblings, but more closer to an uncle/nephew one. It can still be a worthwhile relationship.\n\nAnd when your parents eventually pass, you\u2019ll be grateful for having immediate family.\n\nEdit:  and that kid won\u2019t be 1 year old forever.  Eventually he\u2019ll be someone you can play video games with, build Lego, watch movies, talk to, etc.  \n\nAlso, put yourself in his shoes: how would you feel if you had an older brother, but he never gave a rat\u2019s ass about you?", "I have friends with half-siblings 15-20 years younger than them. Not much interest in them at first because when you're like 15-20 years old yourself, you don't have much in common with a baby or toddler. But give them a few years and wait until they can start forming full sentences and having some coherent thoughts and then you can start building a meaningful relationship. My friends' half-siblings are now in their 20s and are a meaningful part of my friends' adult lives. (The relationship is definitely different from siblings who are only a few years apart from them in age.)", "But they're not asking for any of that. There's no unfair burden. \n\nJust babysitting his own brother once in a while. \n\nAnd in my day, free childcare by older siblings/cousins was an expectation because that's what families do. \n\nMust be a cultural thing.", "This is very true but also a somewhat (understandably) selfish and lonely way of thinking. You don\u2019t have to help them, he is in fact their child,  you are allowed to honor your child free life, but you aren\u2019t seeing a bigger picture- you\u2019re a big brother even if you didn\u2019t ask for it. \n\nYou will always have a little brother now. \n\nIf you don\u2019t think siblings require any acknowledgement or love because there\u2019s no obligation, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s true and your choice. But man, you got a built in support system for life, and he will grow up seeing you either as Superman or super villain and that\u2019s going to be all on you.", "Well the reason would be if you want any kind of relationship with your parents going forward or your sibling at any point in the future. Being part of a family means helping and supporting members of that family. You\u2019re under no obligation to babysit a kid you didn\u2019t make and don\u2019t want. But that also means you\u2019re choosing not to be an integral member of the family.", "You don't have to. \n\nBut it would be a kind thing to do for your parents who raised you and ensured you had what you needed growing up so you could be as independent as you are today. \n\nAfter all, I'm sure they worked very hard to meet your needs growing up. \n\nAnd in my day (understand I'm twice your age, approximately, so closer to your parents' age), family helped family, and older siblings helped their parents by watching younger siblings. \n\nIt would definitely be good to apologize to your parents for being so harsh.", "And it's okay to not want kids. \n\nI'm not childfree by choice, but due to infertility and poverty. And now my husband and I are at an age and in health states to where we can't adopt. \n\nBut I still don't understand family not helping family. Family should be good to each other.", "I mean it sounds like the prior times he declined without explaining his reasons. I thought the explanation was good and would have sufficed. He didn't need to hang up on them.", "You don\u2019t have to stare at the baby, you can literally do whatever you want while keeping an ear out for him. But your decision, he\u2019s not your responsibility. Also don\u2019t be surprised if this ruined your relationship with your parents.", "Hmm I am going to go with YTA then based on your first answer. Your family is desperate for help and you are the only one who can provide it and you know it. Give your parents a break they would do the same for you.", "Spoiler: op can bond with him when he's not one then.", "This may be exactly the reason Op doesn't want a relationship with his baby brother or be involved. He probably does not want to be forced to take responsibility for the kid if something happens to his parents. But Op, you will have to discuss this", "It\u2019s routine childcare from a person with limited days off working a physically demanding job.

Some people just aren\u2019t into family. I have zero contact with my entire family save for my sister with whom I have very limited contact.

But he comes off like he will never have interest in bonding with his brother.", "Yeah, agreed. OP, you better find out if your parents have advanced directives, and what role you want to play.", "No, as I said I have nothing against him and can stand being around him fine. If he think I'm mad at him or don't like him I'll make sure he knows that isn't true.", "He says he\u2019s not even interested in a sibling relationship with his sibling. That\u2019s nothing close to an \u201cintegral family member.\u201d", "Not if that\u2019s what the family needs at that time. If you don\u2019t want to provide what the family needs even if you\u2019re able to do so, you\u2019re choosing not to fully participate. And that\u2019s fine. But that choice means you are not an integral member of the family.", "Toxicity and abuse is one thing. \n\nChoosing to be cruel to someone who hasn't done anything wrong is entirely different. \n\nAnd that's the part I don't understand.", "Do you even have a good relationship with your parents?", "Never expect sure, but never allow?  Why not?  Most people are extremely grateful for grandparents who babysit, if they are responsible adults.", "That is shitty, and if you read all his comments it seems like he has no idea how to interact with babies and he feels really uncomfortable around them which is why the childcare situation is extra baffling. \n\nA person modeled good behavior would know that you can develop a bond with a baby just spending time with them, cuddling, playing.

I hope you don\u2019t say that to people\u2019s faces in the real world", "And his parents are free to refuse to help him with anything in his life ever again. Should've kicked him out of the house the second he turned 18 when his legal obligations ended. That's the best way to go through life right?", "No, it would be *logical* for the parents to blow him off if he asks for help from them in the future. He\u2019s an adult, he can take care of himself.\n\nI think although OP shouldn\u2019t be expected to babysit, his adamant refusal and harshness to his parents means the end result is he\u2019s being an AH - to *himself.* He\u2019s alienated his parents and lost the chance of a relationship with his sibling that might have been a source of happiness in the future. He\u2019s made his bed, now he has to lie in it.", "Idk why you're trying to reach so hard. It's not that hard to understand that a childfree person won't bond with a kid even if that kid happens to be their sibling.", "The last sentence \"I worry I may have been too harsh\" leads me to believe home life wasnt that bad. If it were, I highly doubt he'd be worried about being too harsh", "See that's the sensible thing to do, I just want to make it clear I'm not sitting g on them for having a child at nearly 50 because there's not much wrong with it, but it's the fact they haven't even attempted to adjust their lives to accommodate for their own child. It shouldn't be on their eldest shoulders to pick up their slack, if they were serious about being parents again they had 9 months to get a game plan going.", "Totally agree.  I had heard.  You realise not all the world is extremist Republicans.", "How many pregnancies are unplanned? 1/3? 1/2?", "First, my little smiley should give it away that humour was intended.  Is it shitty?   Nope.  What happens in real life is never what is planned.  We shall see. \n\nYou are the person who finds a joke \u201cpatronising \u201c. I suggest you look up what patronising means. No where do I give of any sense of superiority.\n\nStop taking offence and being outraged at life.", "Sure, because this is all about legal obligations and not choice. Want to become a part time caretaker because of their likely poor planning? No thanks.\n\nBecoming a parent is a choice and a years long commitment. Becoming a child is, well, not a choice. You're describing a significant imbalance in the situations.", "It feels very weird to me that OP isn't allowed to have *one* boundary without it biting him back in the ass. I just don't get it, should he sacrifice every day off to babysit for free a child his parents decided to have because said parents want to enjoy *their* day off?\n\nI'd understand the \"don't expect help when you need it\" part if OP had refused while parents were in emergency mode, but it's literally the parents saying \"can you take over with the kid cause we wanna chill a bit?\" and I get that parenting is stressful and they want a day off but it's not their oldest's responsibility\n\nAnd from the phrasing of the post, it sounds like the parents are calling *exclusively* when they need babysitting. If my parents never talked to me unless it was to ask for a free service that would take up the only time I get for myself, I wouldn't be that inclined to oblige either", "YES, it is hard to understand why you wouldn't want a relationship with your sibling simply because you don't want kids your self. I have no kids and don't want any, but I still see and talk to my siblings. Just to be clear, I don't mean bonding with a baby or even a small child, but that child will grow up one day and be a teen and an adult who may want to know who their brother was/is.", "Having an unplanned pregnancy doesn't mean you have to have an unplanned child. Abortion exists. I have no idea how many pregnancies are unplanned, but just being unplanned doesn't mean it's happening to someone who never wants children so unless you have THAT statistic, it's irrelevant. And regardless of ALL of this, it's still shitty to learn someone has made the choice to not have children, then laugh and tell them that choice doesn't matter and they'll have them anyway.", "How many men are gay? 1/2 or all of them, but just dont know a good dicking?\n\n\"I'd have to say all. You *can't not* try it.\" - you, more or less", "OMG, that high?\n\nWell, even more glad that I live in a country were birth control is free for teenagers and subsidized for adults. (Because of taxes...)\n\nI think we have like 1/5 unplanned here.", "it wasn\u2019t a very good joke if that\u2019s the case", "My first kid was unexpected, although I actually wanted kids (just not right that second). I adore kids, adore taking care of them, love mine, other people's, used to babysit for FUN instead of ie going out clubbing. You get the idea.\n\nAnd when someone tells you that they don't want kids, you do NOT smirk and wink and reference crap like \"life is what happens when we're making other plans\". You shut your cake hole.\n\nIt's awesome when people know what they want. I love that we have contraception, and abortions, and vasectomies/tubals available.\n\nIt's OK to not want to have kids. It's OK to not want to be around kids. It's less OK to pull gross faces while doing so; but that's nowhere NEAR as rude as patronising the crap out of people by insinuating that their choice to not have kids is invalid or will be overruled by some trite aphorism.\n\nKnock it the hell off.", "Surprise surprise, the person who thinks they can tell people their choice to not have kids means nothing doesn't like it when someone tells them they're being an asshole. I honestly don't give a shit whether you intended humor or not. It's not fucking funny. You are absolutely being shitty. Dismissing someone's choice to not have kids is absolutely patronizing, and \"i sUgGesT yOu LoOk uP wHaT pATrOniZinG mEaNs\" is doubly so. And you don't get to just tell someone to not be offended by something you said. Maybe try not saying offensive shit?", "His parents are finding easing a kid in their forties isn\u2019t the same thing as in their twenties, that\u2019s for sure! \n\nThey\u2019re calling him far too much and I think it\u2019s reasonable for him to refuse, but \u201cboundary\u201d is a great word here. The baby sibling may grow up to be someone OP wishes to know - but will say, my \u201cboundary\u201d is I don\u2019t want to have to make nice with somebody who couldn\u2019t be bothered with me.\n\nI think a reasonable amount of babysitting, that wouldn\u2019t destroy OP\u2019s life but also not destroy his relationships, would be maybe once every couple of months.", "Sure, but people do nice things for family even when it's not their \"responsibility\" or \"job\".", "I will give you the shitty bit. I would say he should use condoms with spermicide and make sure she is on the bc shot or implant. Once she is pregnant whether she has a abortion or not is up to her (getting an out of state abortion would be more $$$ & needed if he lives in some states in America!)", "Perhaps not.", "Thank you so much. My friend loves children and wants like five and I'm super childfree and want five cats but we both respected and support each other. I wish more people would be like you and my friend.", "And?", "No, you are wanting to take offence. The world is not about you.", "I'm sure he has his birth control methods well in hand. It's literally none of our business. If OP wants advice on bc, he'll ask for it.", "Oh goddess, I love my child free friends. They ensure I remember to be a Person, not just a Parent.\n\nThe ones who like kids spoil them; the ones who don't are a refuge away from smols. Everyone is valid, and everyone is part of the family.\n\n... Even the people who don't like dogs (which is super unbelievable) are welcome ;)", "You want to not be the bad guy here, but what you want and what happens in reality are two entirely different things. You should stop being offended. You might think you're not being shitty now, but you'll change your mind. We shall see.", "No you\u2019re just super not funny and now you\u2019re getting all defensive. Like just accept your comment was not funny and was very dismissive of people\u2019s life choices. Try again next time k?", "Lmaooo it's too bad they don't do free awards anymore because I'd sooo give you one", "I\u2019m not offended.", "Really? You do make assumptions. Typical"]}
