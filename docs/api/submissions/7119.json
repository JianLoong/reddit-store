You told them you have no interest in babysitting, having done it before with your cousins. They disrespected your wishes as they continued to call repeatedly and asking constantly for you to babysit. It was time to set a boundary, even if you had to do it harshly. They couldn't listen with your wishes when you put it simply. So aggression had to be taken. At day's end, their new child is their responsibility.

I'm assuming at their age it wasn't intended. I would also argue, would it kill the OP to sacrifice a tiny bit of his free time to make them extremely grateful and help them get some rest?\n\nWhether or not you want a relationship with your brother is not the issue for me, its how much of a good son are you willing to be for your parents?\n\nBeing a parent myself, if my son came at me like you did in this scenario.

Don't fuck up your relationship for life. This baby is another being, your sibling. I'm not sure why you are so keen to write off any relationship with them when you have the opportunity to be someone for somebody else, perhaps it's too much pressure and you are not ready for the responsibility. \n\nThe way you spoke to your parents was unnecessary...yes they keep asking because they are DESPERATE.", "NTA You set a boundary that they keep crossing. Perhaps next time don't be so harsh with people.\n\nI would also wait regarding your brother, while the age gap is big he is ultimately still your brother and you may love him once he is old enough to form his character. First give a chance and try and then make decisions based on experience. Otherwise you may miss on some things.", "NAH. \n\nI think it's reasonable when people ask other family members to do them the *occasional* favor of looking after a child so they can get a little break. Babies are exhausting. \n\nIt's also reasonable to say no. \n\nSlight YTA lean for snapping at them, but I can also understand the frustration with dealing with repeated requests, though there are better ways to set boundaries.", "Not the asshole, but also not not the asshole. This is your brother, and although your parents chose to have a newborn you should offer to spend time with your brother. This is for your relationship rather then a babysitter relationship. If you\u2019re not comfortable when he\u2019s 9months old, I hope you would consider once he can start recognizing you. This would be to preserve your relationship rather then babysitting.

It took awhile to build a relationship with her (she was married and starting her family by the time I was 5), she is NC with our parents and a few other familial traumas.

It builds over time. Start real slow & you could build a relationship that becomes important to you both.  Start slow, not hours at a time,  if you decide you want to.", "Spoiler: he won't be a one year old forever.", "It won\u2019t be like siblings, but more closer to an uncle/nephew one. It can still be a worthwhile relationship.\n\nAnd when your parents eventually pass, you\u2019ll be grateful for having immediate family.\n\nEdit:  and that kid won\u2019t be 1 year old forever.  Eventually he\u2019ll be someone you can play video games with, build Lego, watch movies, talk to, etc.  \n\nAlso, put yourself in his shoes: how would you feel if you had an older brother, but he never gave a rat\u2019s ass about you?", "I have friends with half-siblings 15-20 years younger than them. Not much interest in them at first because when you're like 15-20 years old yourself, you don't have much in common with a baby or toddler. But give them a few years and wait until they can start forming full sentences and having some coherent thoughts and then you can start building a meaningful relationship. My friends' half-siblings are now in their 20s and are a meaningful part of my friends' adult lives. (The relationship is definitely different from siblings who are only a few years apart from them in age.)", "But they're not asking for any of that. There's no unfair burden. \n\nJust babysitting his own brother once in a while. \n\nAnd in my day, free childcare by older siblings/cousins was an expectation because that's what families do. \n\nMust be a cultural thing.", "This is very true but also a somewhat (understandably) selfish and lonely way of thinking. You don\u2019t have to help them, he is in fact their child,  you are allowed to honor your child free life, but you aren\u2019t seeing a bigger picture- you\u2019re a big brother even if you didn\u2019t ask for it. \n\nYou will always have a little brother now. \n\nIf you don\u2019t think siblings require any acknowledgement or love because there\u2019s no obligation, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s true and your choice. But man, you got a built in support system for life, and he will grow up seeing you either as Superman or super villain and that\u2019s going to be all on you.", "Well the reason would be if you want any kind of relationship with your parents going forward or your sibling at any point in the future. Being part of a family means helping and supporting members of that family. You\u2019re under no obligation to babysit a kid you didn\u2019t make and don\u2019t want.

And now my husband and I are at an age and in health states to where we can't adopt. \n\nBut I still don't understand family not helping family.

I hate being around children, particularly the youngs, and always hated babysitting when I was growing up too.

Asking for some help/babysitting is not irresponsible. It is not foisting or pawning off a baby on someone. It is not selfish to ask your only family for help (read the comments, people). Wanting a babysitter so you can take a break is not an outrageous or unreasonable ask - parents of all ages need some time away to relax with their partner. It's not a sign of immaturity, poor preparation, inability to care for/raise a child, irresponsibility, or anything else that people are suggesting is some kind of deep flaw in the parents' characters. \n\nAnd where are people getting this idea that he's expected to be a routine caretaker and partial parent to this child? Let's be clear that asking someone weekly if they can find it in their heart to grant you a favor that week is wildly different from someone asking for a weekly all-day caretaker. Yeah the latter isn't so reasonable IMO. But you can't *ever* take a few hours to do something to benefit someone who isn't you? Yeah sure, no one is *owed* a favor and it's \"not your job\" to babysit. Technically correct.

You could even watch him during nap time so you wouldn\u2019t have to actually do anything but be a presence in the home in case he\u2019d happen to wake up. \n\nMy guess is your parents made plenty of sacrifices over the years for you.

IMO if all he did was internalize his feelings until they exploded like a volcano all over his parents, then yeah, op is definitely being an AH here.  Now if he's explained to his parents that he doesn't like being around children and hates babysitting and will never do it, and then they keep asking him to babysit, they are also being an AH.\n\nBut either way, OP blew up on his parents, literally said \"don't ask or don't call\" which they could imply means he wants to go NC, and its equally possible that they had no knowledge about how upset their asking him was making him.  This whole thing seems like it could have been solved by OP just talking to his parents in a healthy, constructive, fashion (like an adult) instead of just internalizing it until it explodes.\n\nSo, IMO, OP's parents may be an AH, but OP is definitely an AH for how he handled it.

Now, you never agreed to be in any kind of debt to those people for the time and care they gave. But it\u2019s still there. And now you have an opportunity to pay some of that back.
