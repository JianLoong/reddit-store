You told them you have no interest in babysitting, having done it before with your cousins. They disrespected your wishes as they continued to call repeatedly and asking constantly for you to babysit. It was time to set a boundary, even if you had to do it harshly. They couldn't listen with your wishes when you put it simply. So aggression had to be taken. At day's end, their new child is their responsibility.

You've told them you don't give a shit about them or their child, and did so in no uncertain terms. Your comfort is more important than trying to help out and always will be. You couldn't care less.\n\nNow you're going to get a child-free experience, but probably also a parent-free experience. Hope you never have an emergency and have someone to turn to.

That\u2019s just cold, man.", "NTA. so much of this story is honestly\ndepressing. it\u2019s sad that 2 middle aged adults are full time workers and are still unable to easily afford child care. imo it shouldn\u2019t even be a question that they can afford that. it\u2019s also sad that they\u2019re having a kid so late in life. he\u2019s probably going to have most of his relatives die while he\u2019s still fairly young. what\u2019s done is done, but his life is going to be harder for sure.\n\nbut you aren\u2019t responsible for the economy nor your parents decision to have another kid. and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to form a bond with him either. any chance at a sibling relationship between you two was lost when your parents tried turning bonding time into charity case. it turns your little brother into work and a burden you have no desire for and only further ostracized you from him. you\u2019re lucky that you\u2019re an adult and can easily turn them down. had you still been living there they definitely would\u2019ve forced parenthood on you. i\u2019m glad you\u2019re remained firm, hopefully they learn to respect your wishes! \n\ni would also like to suggest giving them a little bit of emotional leeway! for 9 months now neither of them have probably had much sleep and are both incredibly overworked and getting older. a lot of people become very desperate for reprieve and i doubt either of your parents are their best selves. if they don\u2019t normally act this way, then it\u2019s probably sleep deprivation talking. just keep sticking to your boundaries and ride the wave until things calm down!", "NAH\n\nYou have a right to your choice here. \n\nBut you were also kinda harsh. I mean, they ARE your parents, and this IS your little brother. \n\nI have to admit that I really don't understand why so many people are so against watching their cousins/siblings or demanding pay for it?\n\nMy older cousin never got paid for watching my sister and me. I never got paid for watching my sister's kids. \n\nSeems to me like family ought to be helping family, y'know?

(I was definitely not planned and my mom had me when she was 32). All my siblings moved out by the time I was 12, so I was pretty much an only child in that respect.

I'm assuming at their age it wasn't intended. I would also argue, would it kill the OP to sacrifice a tiny bit of his free time to make them extremely grateful and help them get some rest?\n\nWhether or not you want a relationship with your brother is not the issue for me, its how much of a good son are you willing to be for your parents?\n\nBeing a parent myself, if my son came at me like you did in this scenario.

Don't fuck up your relationship for life. This baby is another being, your sibling. I'm not sure why you are so keen to write off any relationship with them when you have the opportunity to be someone for somebody else, perhaps it's too much pressure and you are not ready for the responsibility. \n\nThe way you spoke to your parents was unnecessary...yes they keep asking because they are DESPERATE.", "NTA You set a boundary that they keep crossing. Perhaps next time don't be so harsh with people.\n\nI would also wait regarding your brother, while the age gap is big he is ultimately still your brother and you may love him once he is old enough to form his character. First give a chance and try and then make decisions based on experience. Otherwise you may miss on some things.", "NAH. \n\nI think it's reasonable when people ask other family members to do them the *occasional* favor of looking after a child so they can get a little break. Babies are exhausting. \n\nIt's also reasonable to say no. \n\nSlight YTA lean for snapping at them, but I can also understand the frustration with dealing with repeated requests, though there are better ways to set boundaries.", "Not the asshole, but also not not the asshole. This is your brother, and although your parents chose to have a newborn you should offer to spend time with your brother. This is for your relationship rather then a babysitter relationship. If you\u2019re not comfortable when he\u2019s 9months old, I hope you would consider once he can start recognizing you. This would be to preserve your relationship rather then babysitting. Obviously, with you grown, out of the house responsibilities change, you shouldn\u2019t be expected to babysit.

Especially when it comes to infants, not everybody is comfortable watching them.\n\nHowever, I feel like there is more going on here.\n\n- You say that your parents are burnt-out and desperate for help, and yet you not only refuse to help them every single time but even state that you will never help them in the future.\n- You say that you don't want any kind of relationship with your brother. \n- You even go as far as saying \"stop asking or stop calling\".\n\nYour post almost reads like you have been an only child for 20 years, and suddenly having a brother has shifted your relationship with your parents. Is it possible that you are jealous? Or has your relationship with your parents been bad before your brother was born?

It took awhile to build a relationship with her (she was married and starting her family by the time I was 5), she is NC with our parents and a few other familial traumas. But we\u2019re both glad to have each other now. Your brother won\u2019t be one forever. Your relationship is yours to dictate, but you can absolutely have a positive one with him one day.", "You do it like you would with a puppy: you build trust, by being a little silly with it, you both laugh & learn toappreciate each other gradually.\nHe\u2019ll learn fun stuff from you, youll have a little fun being goofy as you show him new stuff. It builds over time. Start real slow & you could build a relationship that becomes important to you both.  Start slow, not hours at a time,  if you decide you want to.", "Spoiler: he won't be a one year old forever.", "It won\u2019t be like siblings, but more closer to an uncle/nephew one. It can still be a worthwhile relationship.\n\nAnd when your parents eventually pass, you\u2019ll be grateful for having immediate family.\n\nEdit:  and that kid won\u2019t be 1 year old forever.  Eventually he\u2019ll be someone you can play video games with, build Lego, watch movies, talk to, etc.  \n\nAlso, put yourself in his shoes: how would you feel if you had an older brother, but he never gave a rat\u2019s ass about you?", "I have friends with half-siblings 15-20 years younger than them. Not much interest in them at first because when you're like 15-20 years old yourself, you don't have much in common with a baby or toddler. But give them a few years and wait until they can start forming full sentences and having some coherent thoughts and then you can start building a meaningful relationship. My friends' half-siblings are now in their 20s and are a meaningful part of my friends' adult lives. (The relationship is definitely different from siblings who are only a few years apart from them in age.)", "But they're not asking for any of that. There's no unfair burden. \n\nJust babysitting his own brother once in a while. \n\nAnd in my day, free childcare by older siblings/cousins was an expectation because that's what families do. \n\nMust be a cultural thing.", "This is very true but also a somewhat (understandably) selfish and lonely way of thinking. You don\u2019t have to help them, he is in fact their child,  you are allowed to honor your child free life, but you aren\u2019t seeing a bigger picture- you\u2019re a big brother even if you didn\u2019t ask for it. \n\nYou will always have a little brother now. \n\nIf you don\u2019t think siblings require any acknowledgement or love because there\u2019s no obligation, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s true and your choice. But man, you got a built in support system for life, and he will grow up seeing you either as Superman or super villain and that\u2019s going to be all on you.", "Well the reason would be if you want any kind of relationship with your parents going forward or your sibling at any point in the future. Being part of a family means helping and supporting members of that family. You\u2019re under no obligation to babysit a kid you didn\u2019t make and don\u2019t want. But that also means you\u2019re choosing not to be an integral member of the family.", "You don't have to. \n\nBut it would be a kind thing to do for your parents who raised you and ensured you had what you needed growing up so you could be as independent as you are today. \n\nAfter all, I'm sure they worked very hard to meet your needs growing up. \n\nAnd in my day (understand I'm twice your age, approximately, so closer to your parents' age), family helped family, and older siblings helped their parents by watching younger siblings. \n\nIt would definitely be good to apologize to your parents for being so harsh.", "And it's okay to not want kids. \n\nI'm not childfree by choice, but due to infertility and poverty. And now my husband and I are at an age and in health states to where we can't adopt. \n\nBut I still don't understand family not helping family.

He didn't need to hang up on them.", "You don\u2019t have to stare at the baby, you can literally do whatever you want while keeping an ear out for him. But your decision, he\u2019s not your responsibility. Also don\u2019t be surprised if this ruined your relationship with your parents.", "Hmm I am going to go with YTA then based on your first answer. Your family is desperate for help and you are the only one who can provide it and you know it. Give your parents a break they would do the same for you.", "Spoiler: op can bond with him when he's not one then.", "This may be exactly the reason Op doesn't want a relationship with his baby brother or be involved. He probably does not want to be forced to take responsibility for the kid if something happens to his parents. But Op, you will have to discuss this", "It\u2019s routine childcare from a person with limited days off working a physically demanding job.

But he comes off like he will never have interest in bonding with his brother.", "Yeah, agreed. OP, you better find out if your parents have advanced directives, and what role you want to play.", "No, as I said I have nothing against him and can stand being around him fine. If he think I'm mad at him or don't like him I'll make sure he knows that isn't true.", "He says he\u2019s not even interested in a sibling relationship with his sibling. That\u2019s nothing close to an \u201cintegral family member.\u201d", "Not if that\u2019s what the family needs at that time. If you don\u2019t want to provide what the family needs even if you\u2019re able to do so, you\u2019re choosing not to fully participate. And that\u2019s fine. But that choice means you are not an integral member of the family.", "Toxicity and abuse is one thing. \n\nChoosing to be cruel to someone who hasn't done anything wrong is entirely different. \n\nAnd that's the part I don't understand.", "Do you even have a good relationship with your parents?", "Never expect sure, but never allow?  Why not?  Most people are extremely grateful for grandparents who babysit, if they are responsible adults.", "That is shitty, and if you read all his comments it seems like he has no idea how to interact with babies and he feels really uncomfortable around them which is why the childcare situation is extra baffling. \n\nA person modeled good behavior would know that you can develop a bond with a baby just spending time with them, cuddling, playing.

I hate being around children, particularly the youngs, and always hated babysitting when I was growing up too.

Asking for some help/babysitting is not irresponsible. It is not foisting or pawning off a baby on someone. It is not selfish to ask your only family for help (read the comments, people). Wanting a babysitter so you can take a break is not an outrageous or unreasonable ask - parents of all ages need some time away to relax with their partner. It's not a sign of immaturity, poor preparation, inability to care for/raise a child, irresponsibility, or anything else that people are suggesting is some kind of deep flaw in the parents' characters. \n\nAnd where are people getting this idea that he's expected to be a routine caretaker and partial parent to this child? Let's be clear that asking someone weekly if they can find it in their heart to grant you a favor that week is wildly different from someone asking for a weekly all-day caretaker. Yeah the latter isn't so reasonable IMO. But you can't *ever* take a few hours to do something to benefit someone who isn't you? Yeah sure, no one is *owed* a favor and it's \"not your job\" to babysit. Technically correct.

You could even watch him during nap time so you wouldn\u2019t have to actually do anything but be a presence in the home in case he\u2019d happen to wake up. \n\nMy guess is your parents made plenty of sacrifices over the years for you.
