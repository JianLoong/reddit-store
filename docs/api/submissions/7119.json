You told them you have no interest in babysitting, having done it before with your cousins. They disrespected your wishes as they continued to call repeatedly and asking constantly for you to babysit. It was time to set a boundary, even if you had to do it harshly. They couldn't listen with your wishes when you put it simply. So aggression had to be taken. At day's end, their new child is their responsibility.

You've told them you don't give a shit about them or their child, and did so in no uncertain terms. Your comfort is more important than trying to help out and always will be. You couldn't care less.\n\nNow you're going to get a child-free experience, but probably also a parent-free experience. Hope you never have an emergency and have someone to turn to.

That\u2019s just cold, man.", "NTA. so much of this story is honestly\ndepressing. it\u2019s sad that 2 middle aged adults are full time workers and are still unable to easily afford child care. imo it shouldn\u2019t even be a question that they can afford that. it\u2019s also sad that they\u2019re having a kid so late in life. he\u2019s probably going to have most of his relatives die while he\u2019s still fairly young. what\u2019s done is done, but his life is going to be harder for sure.\n\nbut you aren\u2019t responsible for the economy nor your parents decision to have another kid. and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to form a bond with him either. any chance at a sibling relationship between you two was lost when your parents tried turning bonding time into charity case. it turns your little brother into work and a burden you have no desire for and only further ostracized you from him. you\u2019re lucky that you\u2019re an adult and can easily turn them down. had you still been living there they definitely would\u2019ve forced parenthood on you. i\u2019m glad you\u2019re remained firm, hopefully they learn to respect your wishes! \n\ni would also like to suggest giving them a little bit of emotional leeway! for 9 months now neither of them have probably had much sleep and are both incredibly overworked and getting older. a lot of people become very desperate for reprieve and i doubt either of your parents are their best selves. if they don\u2019t normally act this way, then it\u2019s probably sleep deprivation talking. just keep sticking to your boundaries and ride the wave until things calm down!", "NAH\n\nYou have a right to your choice here. \n\nBut you were also kinda harsh. I mean, they ARE your parents, and this IS your little brother. \n\nI have to admit that I really don't understand why so many people are so against watching their cousins/siblings or demanding pay for it?\n\nMy older cousin never got paid for watching my sister and me. I never got paid for watching my sister's kids. \n\nSeems to me like family ought to be helping family, y'know?

(I was definitely not planned and my mom had me when she was 32). All my siblings moved out by the time I was 12, so I was pretty much an only child in that respect.

I'm assuming at their age it wasn't intended. I would also argue, would it kill the OP to sacrifice a tiny bit of his free time to make them extremely grateful and help them get some rest?\n\nWhether or not you want a relationship with your brother is not the issue for me, its how much of a good son are you willing to be for your parents?\n\nBeing a parent myself, if my son came at me like you did in this scenario.

Happy to have him whenever. \n\nOf course we have had him overnight when she\u2019s needed us. but as she knows our stance she\u2019s not pushing it on us! \n\nI\u2019m 40 now and when I was 21, no way I\u2019m looking after a baby and even if I said yes, no way I\u2019m looking after them responsibly even if i tried my best!", "YTA yes it's not your responsibility to look after your brother, but your parents were open with you that they are struggling, and this is an opportunity for you to support and bond with family.\n\n Science suggests the brain does not fully mature until 25, this could account for your lack of empathy or understanding of what your parents are going through and how appreciative they would be for your support. Don't fuck up your relationship for life. This baby is another being, your sibling. I'm not sure why you are so keen to write off any relationship with them when you have the opportunity to be someone for somebody else, perhaps it's too much pressure and you are not ready for the responsibility. \n\nThe way you spoke to your parents was unnecessary...yes they keep asking because they are DESPERATE.", "NTA You set a boundary that they keep crossing. Perhaps next time don't be so harsh with people.\n\nI would also wait regarding your brother, while the age gap is big he is ultimately still your brother and you may love him once he is old enough to form his character. First give a chance and try and then make decisions based on experience. Otherwise you may miss on some things.", "NAH. \n\nI think it's reasonable when people ask other family members to do them the *occasional* favor of looking after a child so they can get a little break. Babies are exhausting. \n\nIt's also reasonable to say no. \n\nSlight YTA lean for snapping at them, but I can also understand the frustration with dealing with repeated requests, though there are better ways to set boundaries.", "Not the asshole, but also not not the asshole. This is your brother, and although your parents chose to have a newborn you should offer to spend time with your brother. This is for your relationship rather then a babysitter relationship. If you\u2019re not comfortable when he\u2019s 9months old, I hope you would consider once he can start recognizing you. This would be to preserve your relationship rather then babysitting. Obviously, with you grown, out of the house responsibilities change, you shouldn\u2019t be expected to babysit.

Especially when it comes to infants, not everybody is comfortable watching them.\n\nHowever, I feel like there is more going on here.\n\n- You say that your parents are burnt-out and desperate for help, and yet you not only refuse to help them every single time but even state that you will never help them in the future.\n- You say that you don't want any kind of relationship with your brother. \n- You even go as far as saying \"stop asking or stop calling\".\n\nYour post almost reads like you have been an only child for 20 years, and suddenly having a brother has shifted your relationship with your parents. Is it possible that you are jealous? Or has your relationship with your parents been bad before your brother was born?

Great perspective \ud83d\udc4c.", "The stories here mostly involve the kinds of parents who dump their kids on family members, demand that person gives up their freedoms and life, often don\u2019t ask for permission before putting responsibility on them, or parents asking siblings to bear the burden of parenting siblings to the detriment of their own growth. \n\nIt\u2019s never cute baby, maybe shared with a cousin sitting it\u2019s unreasonable.  Free childcare is not an expectation it\u2019s a gift should be done freely.", "It's not about money, they offered to pay and I still said no.

It took awhile to build a relationship with her (she was married and starting her family by the time I was 5), she is NC with our parents and a few other familial traumas. But we\u2019re both glad to have each other now. Your brother won\u2019t be one forever. Your relationship is yours to dictate, but you can absolutely have a positive one with him one day.", "You do it like you would with a puppy: you build trust, by being a little silly with it, you both laugh & learn toappreciate each other gradually.\nHe\u2019ll learn fun stuff from you, youll have a little fun being goofy as you show him new stuff. It builds over time. Start real slow & you could build a relationship that becomes important to you both.  Start slow, not hours at a time,  if you decide you want to.", "Spoiler: he won't be a one year old forever.", "It won\u2019t be like siblings, but more closer to an uncle/nephew one. It can still be a worthwhile relationship.\n\nAnd when your parents eventually pass, you\u2019ll be grateful for having immediate family.\n\nEdit:  and that kid won\u2019t be 1 year old forever.  Eventually he\u2019ll be someone you can play video games with, build Lego, watch movies, talk to, etc.  \n\nAlso, put yourself in his shoes: how would you feel if you had an older brother, but he never gave a rat\u2019s ass about you?", "I have friends with half-siblings 15-20 years younger than them. Not much interest in them at first because when you're like 15-20 years old yourself, you don't have much in common with a baby or toddler. But give them a few years and wait until they can start forming full sentences and having some coherent thoughts and then you can start building a meaningful relationship. My friends' half-siblings are now in their 20s and are a meaningful part of my friends' adult lives. (The relationship is definitely different from siblings who are only a few years apart from them in age.)", "But they're not asking for any of that. There's no unfair burden. \n\nJust babysitting his own brother once in a while. \n\nAnd in my day, free childcare by older siblings/cousins was an expectation because that's what families do. \n\nMust be a cultural thing.", "This is very true but also a somewhat (understandably) selfish and lonely way of thinking. You don\u2019t have to help them, he is in fact their child,  you are allowed to honor your child free life, but you aren\u2019t seeing a bigger picture- you\u2019re a big brother even if you didn\u2019t ask for it. \n\nYou will always have a little brother now. \n\nIf you don\u2019t think siblings require any acknowledgement or love because there\u2019s no obligation, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s true and your choice. But man, you got a built in support system for life, and he will grow up seeing you either as Superman or super villain and that\u2019s going to be all on you.", "Well the reason would be if you want any kind of relationship with your parents going forward or your sibling at any point in the future. Being part of a family means helping and supporting members of that family. You\u2019re under no obligation to babysit a kid you didn\u2019t make and don\u2019t want. But that also means you\u2019re choosing not to be an integral member of the family.", "You don't have to. \n\nBut it would be a kind thing to do for your parents who raised you and ensured you had what you needed growing up so you could be as independent as you are today. \n\nAfter all, I'm sure they worked very hard to meet your needs growing up. \n\nAnd in my day (understand I'm twice your age, approximately, so closer to your parents' age), family helped family, and older siblings helped their parents by watching younger siblings. \n\nIt would definitely be good to apologize to your parents for being so harsh.", "And it's okay to not want kids. \n\nI'm not childfree by choice, but due to infertility and poverty. And now my husband and I are at an age and in health states to where we can't adopt. \n\nBut I still don't understand family not helping family. Family should be good to each other.", "I mean it sounds like the prior times he declined without explaining his reasons. I thought the explanation was good and would have sufficed. He didn't need to hang up on them.", "You don\u2019t have to stare at the baby, you can literally do whatever you want while keeping an ear out for him. But your decision, he\u2019s not your responsibility. Also don\u2019t be surprised if this ruined your relationship with your parents.", "Hmm I am going to go with YTA then based on your first answer. Your family is desperate for help and you are the only one who can provide it and you know it. Give your parents a break they would do the same for you.", "Spoiler: op can bond with him when he's not one then.", "This may be exactly the reason Op doesn't want a relationship with his baby brother or be involved. He probably does not want to be forced to take responsibility for the kid if something happens to his parents. But Op, you will have to discuss this", "It\u2019s routine childcare from a person with limited days off working a physically demanding job.

Some people just aren\u2019t into family. I have zero contact with my entire family save for my sister with whom I have very limited contact. Some people don\u2019t have families worth being in contact with and some just don\u2019t value those relationships.", "I would never expect ask or allow my parents to watch any hypothetical kid i might have.", "Agreed. But he comes off like he will never have interest in bonding with his brother.", "Yeah, agreed. OP, you better find out if your parents have advanced directives, and what role you want to play.", "No, as I said I have nothing against him and can stand being around him fine. If he think I'm mad at him or don't like him I'll make sure he knows that isn't true.", "He says he\u2019s not even interested in a sibling relationship with his sibling. That\u2019s nothing close to an \u201cintegral family member.\u201d", "Not if that\u2019s what the family needs at that time. If you don\u2019t want to provide what the family needs even if you\u2019re able to do so, you\u2019re choosing not to fully participate. And that\u2019s fine. But that choice means you are not an integral member of the family.", "Toxicity and abuse is one thing. \n\nChoosing to be cruel to someone who hasn't done anything wrong is entirely different. \n\nAnd that's the part I don't understand.", "Do you even have a good relationship with your parents?", "Never expect sure, but never allow?  Why not?  Most people are extremely grateful for grandparents who babysit, if they are responsible adults.", "That is shitty, and if you read all his comments it seems like he has no idea how to interact with babies and he feels really uncomfortable around them which is why the childcare situation is extra baffling. \n\nA person modeled good behavior would know that you can develop a bond with a baby just spending time with them, cuddling, playing.

That\u2019s insane.", "becuase it isn't their job.", "This lowkey reminds me of my sister who was all \"I don't need no help if I have a baby\" in her early 20s and then in her late 20s said that the only way she'd consider having a baby is if our mom would live with her for the first 6 months after birth LOL (she changed to child free in her 30s). Anyway, time and perspective are important.", "Choosing not to help when you\u2019re perfectly capable of doing so it excluding yourself from the family.

Not your kid not your problem.", "Technically NTA but you are being an immature jerk. Is it possible that you\u2019re jealous of your new baby brother? (It happens!) It seems like there\u2019s more at stake / reason for the escalation.", "Eh, you're right, your brother is their responsibility and you can say no to babysitting. \n\nBut I hope to God you'll never need your parents help,cuz you just burned that bridge.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being an asshole, but if you can\u2019t help with some childcare, could you help your parents in other ways?

In a way that doesn\u2019t put you in an uncomfortable situation.\n\nAnd hopefully you can come around to having a relationship with the baby as he/you get a little older. Not close siblings, but you sound a little resentful in your post so hopefully that doesn\u2019t come out when you spend time together", "Definitely NTA although I'll say a bit harsh IMO\nBut im childfree too and know I hate taking care of kids myself and you aren't by no means owed free or even paid childcare \nHope things smooth over", "What's more important your dislike of kids or your love for your parents who raised you?\n\nFfs give them a couple of hours of peace to see them happy and make their life easier.\n\nYTA", "What's more important your dislike of kids or your love for your parents who raised you?\n\nFfs give them a couple of hours of peace to see them happy and make their life easier.\n\nYTA", "If your parents were abusive or shitty parents to you when you were growing up, then NTA. If they were good parents, then YTA. Not for refusing to babysit but for your seeming lack of care for them and your brother.

Did your parents drop you as a kid? Maybe you are at an ate that you only consider be friends with people around your age, and that would be bizarre either way, but to cut off a brother.... eww get over yourself", "YTA \n\nWhat is this new child free shit?? I thought that simple meant that you weren\u2019t going to have children yourself. \n\nYou can\u2019t help your parents out here and there? And even if not how you responded to them was gross af.\n\nIf I was them you wouldn\u2019t be able to ask me for a cup of sugar in the future", "NTA.  You tried being polite, they weren't listening.  At 46 after raising you they knew that having a child takes a lot of work so can't pretend they didn't know what they were in for.  I understand that everyone needs a break sometime, but it's not your responsibility to look after their child, if you did I can only see them expecting you to eventually raise your brother as they get older.", "NTA, your parents should have considered the implications of having another child later in life as they have. You're your own man and not a babysitter. This is all without the fact that electricians work long hard days so giving up one of your days for RR to look after a screaming child sounds pretty selfish on their part.", "NTA I do feel for them but no. Besides, looking after a baby is a very very different task too.", "YTA because you haven't given any indication that your parents were anything less than great parents to you all your life and now they need support from their adult son. If they were crappy parents to you and have always used you then maybe you're not. But this just screams jealously, they were yours and now you have to share them. \n\n\nAt work as an electrician you probably interact with men in their 40s every day and can talk to them, have a laugh with them. That will be you and brother some day. He'll be 15 and you will be 36 and you can play games together or go hiking or watch football games or whatever. Imagine your favourite hobby you have a little person to introduce it to, watch him experience all the amazing about it for the first time but without the responsibility of having to raise him. I have a sibling 20 years younger than me and it is amazing.", "You are an adult. I don't know the relation to your parents, if it was not good and is not good there is no reason to have contact just because they want your help.\n\nBut when you  usually have a good relationship? Family is usually helping each other out. Like, when you would have an accident, and needed care or maybe when you couldn't afford to pay your rent anymore for any reason, would you move back to them? And would they take you back?\n\nAnd then there is the thing with you hating to babysit... In your age you probably have a partner, or close friends. You could say OK, I'm babysitting together with them now and then... And also develop a  relationship to your brother.\n\nBut somehow I have the feeling that yours is not a nice and supportive family full of harmony - and in that case, just forget all of the above. You don't owe it to them, and if they weren't that supportive of you even tho it was their job as a parent, then you  don't need to be supportive now, when it def. is not your job.", "Gonna go against the grain here and say ESH. Parents are TA for assuming that because you're the brother you're automatically free childcare. You're 21 now so they should be allowing you to live your own life and at least try to find someone else to watch the kid before coming to you for help because you're right, it is their responsibility and you didn't ask for it. Living arrangements will be a consideration too, you live with two other guys so would they be comfortable waking up nights to the cries of a baby? \n\n But dude come on you're kind of TA too, you can't just say you won't ever look after your own brother full stop, or even try to have a relationship with him. I hope you guys can try to talk out a compromise where you can watch the kid once in a while while still maintaining your own freedom.", "YTA\n\nFamily helps family. They certainly shouldn't take advantage of you, but in your own words they are desperate. I hope they're spending a shit-ton of money on childcare that's coming out of your inheritance. Or perhaps more correctly, your little brother's inheritance.", "Agreed OP is NTA. Remember the parents will be NTA also when they don't take care of the grand kids when he is exhausted from work and needs help. (Or take more drastic steps like excluding him from their wills)", "Taking care of a baby is a whole ordeal, especially if you're not used to it.  Maybe when the kid is older and can clean and feed himself, things can change in like an uncle kind of way, more than a sibling.  \n\nBut you don't owe them that, ever.  You set your boundary and they kept pushing.  What would they do it you lived in another state?  Demand you come back and raise their kid for them?\n\nNTA", "Especially so |they| can get out of the house on their days off? Nah, they signed up for the child. Eldest did not", "Totally agree with this. The comments on this thread are ridiculous, acting like it's the height of chutzpah to request a bit of help from family.\n\nI won't call OP an asshole, because he is only 21, and 21 year olds can be a little selfish / self involved. It's normal. I just wish the other comments were more balanced, rather than so many \"NTA how dare your old ass parents have a baby and ask you for a bit of help, they are irresponsible monsters\". OP needs more perspective.\n\nOP, I would just advise you to think about your family. If they have always been good to you, helped you and loved you, then it would be nice if you would reciprocate and offer to look after your brother for just a few hours once in a while. Its not really a lot to ask. I know that it seems they are asking all the time, but that is because parenting a baby is pretty relentless, and a few hours break is refreshing, sounds like they are pretty desperate. I would understand your position if you sometimes babysat and they consistently asked for more, but that doesn't seem to be the case.", "NTA.\n\nCurious what help OP would need or be able to get from people who cant even care for their own kid.\n\nEmpty threats imo.\n\nI personally think its more immature to have children you cant afford or dont have the time to take care of.", "He didn't choose to have a child, his parents did. He is absolutely not responsible for his brother, his parents are. They've had a child, they know exactly what to expect. It's not OP's responsibility to raise their child because *gasp* it's not easy, which they once again, already knew. \n\nThey made the choice to have this child. OP didn't. They knew what to expect and took FULL responsibility for that when they decided to go through with the pregnancy.", "Exactly. OP seems very immature and self centered. I can't imagine putting in so much effort and time and heartache into raising a whole human being to be so callously brushed off when I ask for help... they must have been shitty parents to have earned such little love and respect from their son.", "NTA - but you, he is your brother and even if you can work or game while he's sleeping it'll give you a connection. He is your brother.", "A no is a no.\n\nTry asking 15 more times, see what it gets ya.", "In 2022 no one has to keep an unwanted child.\n\nHe moved out at 20, something tells me it wasn't the best environment especially given the economic issues going on right now.", "Parents: \"It wasn't our choice to go speeding and crash your car. You want us to take care of you while your broken leg heals? Not our problem.\"", "Clearly parents are supposed to be there for their adult children without ever asking them to so much as lift a finger.  Ever.  /s", "Yep, youngest by 9 years. My older brother only valued me once he started having kids and wanted a free babysitter. My only childhood memories of him are of him beating me up. I did babysit my nephew. I did eventually cut off contact with my brother because of how he treats my nephew who thankfully lives full time with his mom now. I visit my nephew at her place.", "OP said they're not going to have kids, so I doubt they're worried about that.", "Yeah I'm a little surprised by the comments vilifying the parents for just asking and assuming the worst of them. Asking family for some babysitting so they can get a little break isn't necessarily exploitative, abusive, irresponsible, and/or inconsiderate. (I mean, it can be under certain circumstances, but not clear that is the case here.) \n\nAlso I feel like the parents' age is kinda irrelevant to a lot of the criticisms. Babies are exhausting and the lack of sleep is rough at any age. Even parents in their 20s and 30s struggle with young babies and would welcome help and breaks.", "You realise they both work full time so don't struggle in general it's childcare and that's expensive for everyone even here in the uk ppl struggle with the price of childcare. I'm not sure how your family manages but when 2 people work FULL TIME they generally need help with care and as for help if he's ever homeless, needs food, medical care. It could be anything small to something big. When you get older you realise life's not just black and white", "I think there could be more than that in play here.  It doesn't sound like OP has made much if any effort to bond with his brother.  That is his choice not my place to question that but I think what the parents are likely trying to do is force that bonding more than just looking for a free babysitter.  My guess at least.", "WTF I said that I said not to cut of contact with his little brother and that he shouldn't expect his parents to be there for him when he needs them and I've raised a 16 yo son as a single parent so I know how hard it is trust me. He should just expect that his parents may use this against him the future", "Shitty parents.. yet theyre goin for round 2 lmao", "Uh that\u2019s no longer true with the loss of Roe v Wade. That has gotten COMPLICATED AF and in a practical way isn\u2019t true for lots of women. Theoretically this is true.

I do think a compromise (should you ever be open to) would be to hang with your brother while the parents are home.  Just for like a couple of hours. They probably would appreciate the ability for a nap, do chores around the house, and you wouldn\u2019t be left by yourself in case you are unsure about something. As you get comfortable then maybe your stance will change or maybe it won\u2019t at all.", "He doesn't want a kid, he doesn't have a kid, it's not fair to expect him to be responsible for someone else's just because they don't want to be, no matter how temporarily. \n\nThe whole \"they would do it for him\" thing is total bullshit too - they already did it for them. It's clear they either don't share his aversion to being responsible for a kid, or just don't have the capability to anticipate the consequences of their decisions. You don't get to pull the \"they would do it for you\" card if they would actually do it anyway.", "You might need help in other ways in the future. You might need a place to stay for a while: You could get laid off. You could get injured. Your house could burn down. Have you looked around the world recently? Your future is not as secure as you think it is."]}
