I even work in mental health and with and around therapists. I have adhd and see a psychiatrist regularly for 10+ years, though I wouldn\u2019t call him a therapist. We actually have a bit of a weird \u201ccolleague\u201d type relationship where we discuss work related things during my med appointments. \n\nI (30F) have a couple close friends who are all in therapy and see their therapist regularly. One of my friends is kind of\u2026 high strung? Everytime I see her, she tells me everything about her therapist and what happened in their weekly appointment and what was discussed etc. She also constantly posts about it on social media and is always telling everyone they need to go to therapy. I don\u2019t have a problem with this, tbh. Like cool, she\u2019s probably right. \n\nI don\u2019t want to try and gas myself up here, but I\u2019ve always had a very laidback and relaxed type of personality. I don\u2019t have drama, I\u2019ve never been in fights with friends or family. I don\u2019t have \u201cenemies\u201d or people I avoid.

I don\u2019t have a problem apologizing or admitting when I\u2019m wrong. I naturally set boundaries with people and don\u2019t have a problem doing so. All in all I think I am a well adjusted, practical, and reasonable person. Sure I\u2019m not perfect, who is? But I think I have the tools that therapy provides people already built into myself and have from a young age. \n\nAfter probably the 20th time my friend told me I should go to therapy and how everyone needs it I told her that I genuinely don\u2019t think I need it. That perhaps everyone could theoretically benefit from it, but that not everyone actually needs it. That some people are actually okay mentally and that\u2019s okay too. And that she doesn\u2019t need to champion mental health care to someone who works in mental health. \n\nShe got incredibly angry and left my house crying.

Even reading this back I think I could across like I\u2019m \u201ctoo good\u201d for therapy but can I get an outside opinion? One can still be objectively correct and still be an asshole.

You need a new friend, not therapy.", "NTA. Ngl it feels like your friend has a lot of attention seeking behavior regarding her own therapy. Therapy is great, but you should never seek validation just because you\u2019re proactive about your mental health.", "Wow! She really needs all that therapy she is getting lol\n\nAnd agreed, therapy is not for everybody.", "I'm in your camp.  I don't think I need therapy either, for very similar reasons.  Sure, I've had hard stuff happen in my life, but I've worked through it.  I've made mistakes, but grown and learned from them.\n\nSometimes I read the constant comments on Reddit about someone needing to go to therapy, and often it's valid, but sometimes I think whatever the topic is, it's just part of life, and if you are normally stable and have a reasonable life, therapy is not necessary.  Things can be worked through, figured out, learned from without having to go and have therapy.  If you have good family and friends, your chances are even better.\n\nOf course, therapy is extremely helpful for many people, and some people don't have the right tools in their life to manage themselves, or some issues are very serious and do need help.  But not everybody is in that position.", "Mostly NTA\n\nIn truth, 99.9% of people could probably benefit from some level of therapy or life coaching or just \"general talking it out with an uninvolved 3rd party\".  I think that is a basic truth of the human condition.\n\nThat doesn't mean everyone SHOULD pay for therapy.\n\nYou're right to refuse.  You probably unintentionally hurtful.  It's more than fair to say to your friend, \"I agree that it could be very helpful, I'll look into it.\" and drop it.  If they insist, cut them off with \"I appreciate your concern.  I feel this is a somewhat private and something I want to work through on my own.\"", "NTA.

Because she\u2019s saying there\u2019s something wrong with you, and that would get pretty old pretty fast. \n \nThe problem you have here, is that she seems to have built her entire personality and existance around being a person who gets therapy, so when you said that you don\u2019t need it, you inadvertantly undermined *her entire existance*. \n\nFrankly she sounds ghastly, but no doubt you have a good reason for being her friend.

It's not my job to tell you what you need to do for your health. It would be stupid if I tried to give you medical advice like \"do this diet for X health benefit\" or \"Y medication helps with Z,\" and mental health isn't different. How the fuck should I, or anyone else, know what you do or don't need?\n\nYour friend is being weird. Probably taking it personally that you rejecting therapy means something negative for her.", "NTA. I'm from the UK and I don't know a single person who has had therapy.

The therapists in the US must make a killing.", "NTA, therapy isn't the only tool for taking care of your MH and her pushing it on you is kinda an AH move. In your shoes I might have asked her why she thinks you need it specifically cause it's pretty obnoxious & pointed to tell someone to go over and over like that\n\nIt sounds absolutely like what you've said; it helped her so everyone needs it & she hasn't given that stance any nuance or considered what it means when she bullies individuals to go over and over again", "Do you have any idea WHY  your friend feels you need therapy, beyond perhaps a general perspective that literally every person in her social sphere should be in therapy?

I ask because I wonder if there is some 'problem' she is perceiving you're having that would benefit from therapy.

Or do you just generally feel like all adult humans should be in therapy?\"  \n\n\nNTA for your perspective or trying to gently push back on what felt like a nagging, obsessive approach that she had to trying to get you to go to therapy, though it sounds like your delivery was a bit abrasive.", "NTA.

I don\u2019t talk all the credit for it, ive had a good childhood with fantastic parents.\nIve had a big health problem last year, some days are hard, ive had anxiety about the future, but im learning to handle it, and overcoming it slowly.
