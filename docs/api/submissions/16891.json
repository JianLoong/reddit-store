Things can be worked through, figured out, learned from without having to go and have therapy.

You do sound very well adjusted. Not everyone is. I was told by a therapist years ago that I was perfectly normal and honestly had no need of therapy.

I've been in therapy at different times in my life, as a kid when my parents were getting divorced, in college, post college. \n\nIt's been helpful, usually it's nice to have a professional to bounce some humdinger of a problem off of, someone totally detached. So at most, I go to 2-3 sessions, figure out what it was, thank the doc and go on my way.\n\nI have a friend who's been after it for years. That's her thing. It's not everyone's thing. Some people just don't need it, it's a waste of money and time for them. And that's ok. \n\nI do get worried when someone has a specific problem, goes to the same therapist for years, and doesn't seem to make much headway on it. I don't really know what's going on there, but if a therapist is a \"head mechanic\", I'd be looking at a different mechanic after that amount of time.

From a work perspective, I'm sure you are aware of how short handed the mental health field is right now.

Just be open to the possibility that you may benefit from it in the future.\n\nIt's also worth noting that it is a medicine with a limited supply: there are only so many trained therapists. In many areas they are very booked up and difficult to access. If every single person went to therapy regardless if they needed it, there would be almost no appointments available for the people who really need it.", "Burn! NTA by the way.", "Nice!", "This exactly.  I could definitely benefit from therapy, but I know myself well enough to know I will just lie to the person and waste both of our time.\n\nNTA either.", "My husband is like OP. He tends to have pretty rational logical ways of dealing with his feelings, he sets boundaries on his own, he cares about other people without feeling obligated to them most of the time, and he can have direct conversations about problems if they arise. There are things he will do that aren't optimal social behavior, but I think that's just part of personing. He's working on those things. Some people really do have a voice in their head that says \"I'm having a bad time about this, what would I or a therapist to tell me to do if a friend came to me in this situation\" that gives them good advice and that they can then follow and be totally fine. Doesn't mean there wouldn't be anything there for him, but it's probably not worth it.\n\nI on the other hand have been through therapy for social anxiety, and while it doesn't make financial sense to get therapy at this point it probably wouldn't hurt even now? I stopped going because I was reaching the point where when I encountered situations I employed tools and the main problem was with my remembering to employ the tools I had been taught, not with whether or not I had them. I wasn't really getting anything new out of it and my therapist agreed that we had accomplished what we had set out to accomplish. I still do struggle with my mental health shit, but therapy has provided me the tools to do it much more successfully and I am a much happier person now.\n\nIn general I think my rule of thumb is that if you deal with significant mental health related distress on a regular basis therapy is probably good for you and if you're mostly a happy stable person with good relationships it's too expensive and we have too much of a shortage of mental health professionals for it to be a good use of resources. \n\nI suspect you're very much right about the friend. There are a lot of people who make mental health and the process of handling it more of their identity than is probably a good idea, and I could definitely see OP's statement feeling like either an attack on that identity or feeling like it was looking down on that person and all the work they're doing. Which is not what it was! But it seems very likely that she's projecting something that she feels or that she thinks other people feel about her onto the statement.", "I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one who noticed that \ud83d\udc4d", "Thanks for the insight! It's great to hear that it's not as rare a thing as I thought it was. Your input only reinforces my original stance: OP is definitely not wrong for reacting the way they did."]}
