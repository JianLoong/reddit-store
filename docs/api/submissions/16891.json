I could definitely benefit from therapy, but I know myself well enough to know I will just lie to the person and waste both of our time.\n\nNTA either.", "My husband is like OP. He tends to have pretty rational logical ways of dealing with his feelings, he sets boundaries on his own, he cares about other people without feeling obligated to them most of the time, and he can have direct conversations about problems if they arise. There are things he will do that aren't optimal social behavior, but I think that's just part of personing. He's working on those things. Some people really do have a voice in their head that says \"I'm having a bad time about this, what would I or a therapist to tell me to do if a friend came to me in this situation\" that gives them good advice and that they can then follow and be totally fine. Doesn't mean there wouldn't be anything there for him, but it's probably not worth it.\n\nI on the other hand have been through therapy for social anxiety, and while it doesn't make financial sense to get therapy at this point it probably wouldn't hurt even now? I stopped going because I was reaching the point where when I encountered situations I employed tools and the main problem was with my remembering to employ the tools I had been taught, not with whether or not I had them. I wasn't really getting anything new out of it and my therapist agreed that we had accomplished what we had set out to accomplish. I still do struggle with my mental health shit, but therapy has provided me the tools to do it much more successfully and I am a much happier person now.\n\nIn general I think my rule of thumb is that if you deal with significant mental health related distress on a regular basis therapy is probably good for you and if you're mostly a happy stable person with good relationships it's too expensive and we have too much of a shortage of mental health professionals for it to be a good use of resources. \n\nI suspect you're very much right about the friend. There are a lot of people who make mental health and the process of handling it more of their identity than is probably a good idea, and I could definitely see OP's statement feeling like either an attack on that identity or feeling like it was looking down on that person and all the work they're doing. Which is not what it was!

Sounds like your friend needs therapy.", "In some ways I'm a lot like your friend. I see people in my life who I believe would benefit from therapy and I wish I could somehow push them into it. But I once had a friend who tried therapy and was insistent that I must try it. I had, years prior (and since), but I was not in a position to at the time. Well, she ended up telling me that she wasn't willing to watch me ruin my life (to put it nicely) and insisted that I call a therapy hotline *while she was in the room, so she could be sure I actually did it*. Which would involve talking to someone about my issues to find an appropriate therapist. I was not comfortable with that, and the friendship ended rather abruptly right there. \n\nThis is all to say that deep down I'm a pretty big hypocrite when it comes to therapy, but I agree that people who are pushy about it are annoying and not always correct. You're NTA and I'm honestly quite jealous of your coping skills and emotional balance haha", "Not to belittle therapy, but some people think everyone *must* have a chiropractor and a lawyer and get facials (and nails and hair color and maybe Botox) done regularly, when this is clearly not the case.

Even for those that aren't mentally well, therapy honestly just isn't for everyone. I have many mental health conditions and have tried therapy many times, with me feeling that it just wasn't helping.\n\nPeople really need to start viewing therapy more as a potential tool to help you on your journey rather than a \"magical life fixer\".

Need therapy and could benefit from therapy are two entirely different things.\n\nI think pretty much anyone could benefit from occasional therapy sessions just to have someplace and someone to vent to about struggles, etc., who is going to be absolutely neutral. There are so many tools and techniques that many people never learn, too, that therapists can help teach.  Finally, talking to a therapist can help catch things, like serious stress or anxiety, before it has a chance to grow into something bigger.\n\nBut need? No, not everyone needs it, and I do say this as someone who *does* need it. \n\nBut I can also say that sometimes, when my depression or anxiety is particularly bad, it's hard to remember that not everyone feels this way. Your friend may be in that sort of state - she's so naturally highstrung (which is often code for frequently stressed or anxious) that she doesn't realize her baseline is off from normal. So she thinks everyone else feels the same way, and needs therapy as much as she does. Obviously I can't read her mind, but it's the first thing I thought of when reading your post.", "NTA. My friend is like this with her therapist. She loves her therapist. Talks to therapist every week. Every week for years. I am sometimes tempted to ask her if she thinks her therapy is working or if she should maybe try a new therapist as she seems to be making no progress with hers. I haven't because she is a bit histrionic and probably just likes having the undivided attention.", "NTA", "LOL.\n\nA good therapist will also point out to this lady that she (the friend) isn\u2019t a therapist and is waaaay outside of her lane in continuing to advise people to go to therapy.  She is simply unqualified to make the determination as to whether or not someone needs therapy.  \n\nFurthermore, patients have an array of legal protections regarding the confidentiality of therapy, including whether or not someone is or has been a patient, what their diagnoses were or were not, and who their provider is.  Depending on the jurisdiction, publicly discussing therapy could be a waiver of privilege.  Anyone who understands the confidentiality surrounding medical care should not be pressuring people to \u201copen up\u201d about their own therapy or lack thereof.\n\nFor extra fun: therapists are supposed to respect people\u2019s autonomy.  The therapist can advise about a course of action, and accepts that unless the person is at risk to themselves or others, the patient\u2019s autonomy must be respected.  You *cannot* help someone in therapy by overriding their autonomy.\n\nNow I\u2019m an attorney, and our ethical codes overlap with those of therapists, so I shamelessly roast people like this friend.", "Its honestly rare to hear people having a good childhood and no trauma stuff happening, i think you are right the stigma about seeking mental healthcare is still rather large and they hear judgement where there is none, mixed in with disbelief and/or jealousy\n\nI dont think people realise how super duper important a stable foundation built in childhood actually is, just a general idea, but not how everything else in life gets built on that foundation, no matter how hard you work you can never repair that foundation as properly as its suppose to be done in childhood, not with the rest of your life (house) gets built on top of that foundation\n\nPeople who do had a good childhood have a huge advantage later in life dealing with ups and downs cuz of that smooth strong foundation, makes sense to me that you dont feel like you need a therapist, your tools were built into your foundation\n\nI\u2019m jealous as heck, i would love to know how that feels, am also happy for you though", "INFO: You regularly meet with a mental health professional to discuss your life but you think you don\u2019t need therapy?

She needs to stop projecting her feelings on other people.", "NTA\nI went to therapy as a child and through my school years. At first it helped, and then as I grew older, I sort of realized it wasn't working for me. And I went through multiple therapists. They just didn't click with me.

I scheduled it and after a few months of having really nothing to talk about besides some really super shitty doctor appointments I dealt with by switching doctors, my therapist was like well you\u2019re remarkably self assured, emotionally regulated, and doing all the things you need to be doing so I think you can discontinue therapy. She liked my sessions cause they weren\u2019t stressful for her either and I\u2019d always show her whatever arts/crafts/self care I\u2019d been doing since I didn\u2019t really have anything else.
