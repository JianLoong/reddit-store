If she wants to do it, what\u2019s the problem?\n\nSecond, you say there\u2019s a history of abusive manipulation in her family, and your solution is to\u2026. Tell her what she can and can\u2019t do?\n\nFinally, being in the second trimester of pregnancy doesn\u2019t render you an invalid. She can\u2019t scoop the litter box because cat litter boxes carry a specific risk of toxoplasmosis infection that can harm the fetus. That\u2019s like saying \u201chow is she supposed to take care of her grandma when she can\u2019t even shoot whiskey anymore?!\u201d Assuming grandma is a human, not a cat, it\u2019s not an issue.", "YTA What is this \"let her\" baloney.  She should leave you just for that additude toward her.  She is not your child, she is your partner.  Your equal.  She can't scoop the cat box because of something she can catch from it.  2nd trimester of pregnancy does not make most people disabled.  Your wife can do what she normally does pretty much.  With any of those kind of surgeries they get people out of bed and moving real quick.  Butt out.  Your wife is an adult.", "Using the word \u201cabuse\u201d in this situation from her Dad to her is so flippant.", "YTA. You might be coming from a place of love and concern, but it\u2019s not your call to make. You can\u2019t \u201crefuse to LET her\u201d take care of her grandma. If she\u2019s happy doing it, you\u2019re gonna have to deal with it.", "Yta if she didn't want to do it, then you'd have a case. However,  you call her family abusive and controlling then turn around and........act the same.", "It\u2019s probably a little presumptuous to ask but be honest. What\u2019s the extent of your disability? Are you against her helping her grandmother bc she\u2019ll have less time for you? I agree with the consensus here - YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re trying to come across as the \u2018concerned husband\u2019 who\u2019s only thinking about the welfare of his wife but I get the impression your feelings aren\u2019t quite as selfless as you\u2019d like them to sound. \nSo she\u2019s in her second trimester? That\u2019s not a cause for concern. This isn\u2019t the 17th century when pregnancy reduced women to being invalids. It\u2019s not as if your wife\u2019s going to be strapping gma to her back and running a 10k. She\u2019s offering to help the woman who, I\u2019m sure, has helped her countless times throughout her own life. \nBe thankful you married a woman who values Family time and enjoys helping others. Sounds like she\u2019s going to make a great mom! You don\u2019t need to fight her battles when it comes to her family; just be supportive and let her know you guys are a team and you\u2019ll help her with anything she needs. Offer advice **IF** she asks, be a sounding board when she needs to vent her frustration, and know when to bite your tongue. You don\u2019t need to badmouth her relatives; it\u2019s only going to make you look petty. \n\nLook, you\u2019re obviously on the right track bc you care enough to solicit the advice of complete strangers on the internet lol Just stand back a little and let your wife decide how much she can/wants to help.", "YTA it\u2019s up to your wife.  She\u2019s pregnant not incapacitated! Like her grandmother will be for a week or so.  Get over yourself", "The idea of \u201c refusing to allow your wife\u201d to act in this way or that is a bad start. You discuss it and try to come to mutual understanding or agreement. YTA.", "YTA... \n\nFirst: It is not your choice to make. And you sound tad controlling.\n\nSecond: Second trimester is normally not that debilitating that she cannot care a bit for an old women who i assume lives alone and is normally fit enough to do so. So its just about cooking a bit or helping her change cloths. Who also jsut had a serious surgery.\n\nAnd in that case she JUST took her from the hospital to her home. It was literally the first day out of the hospital dude.", "Gently put, YWBTA if issuing ultimatums is your 'love language'.  This is a pretty stressful situation, and I would be worried if I were in your place. I would guess, however, that like most people your wife will be quite upset if you take over and make decisions for her about whether or not she is capable of caring for her grandmother.  Maybe instead of just saying nope and creating additional stress for her,  you can do some legwork now to help your wife find additional help for her grandmother.  Contact the hospital's social worker to ask about discharge planning and what would be needed for home care in cases like Gramma's (you won't be able to get specific information on her, but you can ask for a general idea of what is needed). Call the home health care agencies in your area to  find out their rates and whether or not Gramma's insurance covers this sort of service. Get a quote for out of pocket for night care from the agencies, so you can give it to FIL, who apparently has a job. Both of you reach out to your wife's health care provider,  to get a good understanding of what she can and can't do physically in the second trimester in terms of caring for Gramma.  Instead of putting your foot down, stretch your hand out a bit to your wife and her grandmother- it may not be appreciated by the rest of the  family, but I rather think your wife will be very thankful for your help here.", "Sounds like you just want all her attention for yourself instead, smh\n\nYour \"wifey\" is a grown ass woman who knows better than you what she is or is not capable of right now. YTA", "YTA. Just because she\u2019s pregnant doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s useless. If she wants to take care of her grandmother, let her. I don\u2019t see the problem here. Why are you so against it?", "YTA. She's your Wife, not your property. She's allowed to make her own decisions in life over she does or doesn't feel capable of doing. And if you genuinely think differently to that, then it's not her Father who's the abuser, it's you.", "YTA She isn't your property. She gets to decide if she's going to take care of a family member. She's pregnant, not helpless.", "So as a disabled vet I assume she takes care of you. And you don\u2019t want her to be distracted from that. And instead of offering up solutions like a strong, confident and capable man, instead you condemn and attack like a threatened and weak child. How sad and tragic for your wife.", "YTA your wife is pregnant and expected to look after her grandmother and your not willing to help. Even if you can't physically you can arrange something for grandmother so at least the physical toil is lessened and as for affording it you can always have a meeting with her family about costs", "I\u2019m going with NAH though you don\u2019t explain the living arrangements or what your wife\u2019s dad may or may not be doing to help.\n\nIf you are concerned with your wife\u2019s physical well-being I will tell you the assistance she will be providing is not physically demanding. I\u2019m helping someone with this right now and, post 2 weeks, I really don\u2019t have to do anything except drive to pt appointments, though I do continue to do most of the meal prep. That\u2019s where you can help - make some meals that can be popped into the oven and reheated.  Primary tools needed for recovery are - walker then a cane, ice therapy machine, and a shower chair. If they don\u2019t have those things do what you can to borrow/buy those items As they will help tremendously.", "NAH\n\nYou want your wife to stand up for herself, which is understandable, but this is ultimately her decision. She has to form boundaries with her own family if she feels she is being used or, as you put it, abused.\n\nI will just say, though, that nothing you're saying here indicates abuse. It sounds like her father should probably be doing more, but going to a hospital, helping get grandma home after surgery, and contributing to her wellbeing after surgery is not in-and-of itself full-time caretaking. I would do this for my grandparents in a heartbeat because I love them. Have you considered that maybe she wants to be there for her family during hardships like these?\n\nShe can't scoop a litter box right now because being close to feces could risk very specific diseases, but nothing you're stating here indicates that she is infirm, on bedrest, or cannot help out. Nothing you're saying here indicates that the work she is being asked to do is specifically physically difficult, either. \n\nUltimately, it is her body and she has to draw those lines. I admire that you care so much for your wife. Continue to encourage her to care for herself and put her foot down if it gets to be too much.", "NTA to worry about her health, but realistically, even if you refuse, what's going to change? It's not like you can physically prevent her from caring for her grandmother, and it doesn't seem like she is willing to listen to your concerns.", "The hospital won't release her to home unless she is able to do some things on her own.

I love how OP put in that thing about the litter box thinking we'd all be like \"oh wow, she's so debilitated from pregnancy she can't EVEN scoop the litter box!\" Like no one on Reddit has ever been pregnant or known a pregnant person well enough to know that cleaning cat litter is one VERY SPECIFIC thing that is recommended to avoid during pregnancy because of the risk of exposure to one VERY SPECIFIC parasite.\n\nOP, YTA for that and thinking it's up to you to \"let\" your wife care for a relative.", "NTA.\n\nOnly people who have been abused by their family (abuse takes many  forms) or saw someone they love suffer from it get it.\n\nBeing a caretaker take a HUGE toll on people mental and physical health, you feel like she is in a vulnerable situation due to her pregnancy and want to push her to see to her need and health first.\n\nIts not like you ordered her, you gave your unfiltered opinion about a situation which you find unacceptable.\n\nWho can blame you for this?", "This sounds more like.....\"Not fair!

First - there is a serious risk to a fetus with changing the cat litter. It\u2019s not like she can\u2019t bend over. Your wife can make her own decisions on who she can help and take care. Helping her grandmother for a week or so is not going to hurt her.", "As others have said. Your wife should do this if she wants to. You can have the talk about her spending too much time and attention on her family another time.\nAlso, knee surgery patients need a lot of help the first few days while on crutches. I was up and around in a limited way in a couple days. I could get myself a meal and then remember i couldn't carry the plate to the dining table. She won't be able to drive for a few weeks, but the PT people will come to her the first week or even 2. So though she needs someone there, your wife should have plenty of rest time and time to herself.", "NTA, your wife is a people pleaser and her family doesn't care about her, so you have to. It is literally your role as her husband to try to get her to see this, and to protest when she's hurting herself. Who else should be expected to speak with her? \n\nEspecially while she's pregnant, it's not wrong for you to just tell her straight up, no, what you're planning to do is bad for your and our child's health.", "My dad just turned 80 today & he had both knees replaced in the last 2 years.  The first couple of days were rough & he needed a little bit of help.  But after that, he was doing everything on his own.  He had his walker & would cook in the kitchen, shower & use the bathroom without help.  Granted, I was there, but he didn't use me for any of it.  I don't see any reason why she should have to care for her for several weeks.  There s/b no reason she can't do most of the stuff on her own.", "YTA, this isn\u2019t the same as cleaning the litter box. Unless her doctor has told her that she can\u2019t do any lifting or personal care there\u2019s no reason that she can\u2019t assist if she chooses to do so. It is not abuse for her father to let her or even ask her to care for her grandmother. If she wants to do it, you have no right to tell her she can\u2019t.", "YTA ... so because other family will let grandma suffer you will too.  I have worked up until my children's birth, so unless she has a reason she cant, quit dictating to her what she can and can't do.  Grandma is going to need help for a finite period and then your wife can back off.  Also, unless your disability preevnts you from doing anything, you should be there too.", "And why would she want to read the cat's mail? (Sorry couldn't resist).", "It really, really depends on the grandmother's current state after the surgery and what the wife is expected to do. Is grandmother bedbound, will wife have to give personal care on her own, etc. Full-time caregiving can be very physical work and I can understand OP's point of view if there's reasonable risk to his wife's/the baby's health (eg heavy lifting). I don't think we have enough info to properly judge here.\n\nSource: worked as a carer", "Right?  Can't imagine the letterbox has anything but crap in it anyways.", "Hahahaha I missed that.", "Always so much shit in the mail!"]}
