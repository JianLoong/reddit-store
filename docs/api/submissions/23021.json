Tell her what she can and can\u2019t do?\n\nFinally, being in the second trimester of pregnancy doesn\u2019t render you an invalid.

She should leave you just for that additude toward her.  She is not your child, she is your partner.  Your equal.  She can't scoop the cat box because of something she can catch from it.  2nd trimester of pregnancy does not make most people disabled.  Your wife can do what she normally does pretty much.  With any of those kind of surgeries they get people out of bed and moving real quick.  Butt out.  Your wife is an adult.", "Using the word \u201cabuse\u201d in this situation from her Dad to her is so flippant.", "YTA.

That\u2019s not a cause for concern. This isn\u2019t the 17th century when pregnancy reduced women to being invalids.

Sounds like she\u2019s going to make a great mom! You don\u2019t need to fight her battles when it comes to her family; just be supportive and let her know you guys are a team and you\u2019ll help her with anything she needs. Offer advice **IF** she asks, be a sounding board when she needs to vent her frustration, and know when to bite your tongue. You don\u2019t need to badmouth her relatives; it\u2019s only going to make you look petty. \n\nLook, you\u2019re obviously on the right track bc you care enough to solicit the advice of complete strangers on the internet lol Just stand back a little and let your wife decide how much she can/wants to help.", "YTA it\u2019s up to your wife.

This is a pretty stressful situation, and I would be worried if I were in your place. I would guess, however, that like most people your wife will be quite upset if you take over and make decisions for her about whether or not she is capable of caring for her grandmother.  Maybe instead of just saying nope and creating additional stress for her,  you can do some legwork now to help your wife find additional help for her grandmother.  Contact the hospital's social worker to ask about discharge planning and what would be needed for home care in cases like Gramma's (you won't be able to get specific information on her, but you can ask for a general idea of what is needed). Call the home health care agencies in your area to  find out their rates and whether or not Gramma's insurance covers this sort of service. Get a quote for out of pocket for night care from the agencies, so you can give it to FIL, who apparently has a job. Both of you reach out to your wife's health care provider,  to get a good understanding of what she can and can't do physically in the second trimester in terms of caring for Gramma.  Instead of putting your foot down, stretch your hand out a bit to your wife and her grandmother- it may not be appreciated by the rest of the  family, but I rather think your wife will be very thankful for your help here.", "Sounds like you just want all her attention for yourself instead, smh\n\nYour \"wifey\" is a grown ass woman who knows better than you what she is or is not capable of right now.

I\u2019m helping someone with this right now and, post 2 weeks, I really don\u2019t have to do anything except drive to pt appointments, though I do continue to do most of the meal prep. That\u2019s where you can help - make some meals that can be popped into the oven and reheated.  Primary tools needed for recovery are - walker then a cane, ice therapy machine, and a shower chair. If they don\u2019t have those things do what you can to borrow/buy those items As they will help tremendously.", "NAH\n\nYou want your wife to stand up for herself, which is understandable, but this is ultimately her decision. She has to form boundaries with her own family if she feels she is being used or, as you put it, abused.\n\nI will just say, though, that nothing you're saying here indicates abuse. It sounds like her father should probably be doing more, but going to a hospital, helping get grandma home after surgery, and contributing to her wellbeing after surgery is not in-and-of itself full-time caretaking. I would do this for my grandparents in a heartbeat because I love them. Have you considered that maybe she wants to be there for her family during hardships like these?\n\nShe can't scoop a litter box right now because being close to feces could risk very specific diseases, but nothing you're stating here indicates that she is infirm, on bedrest, or cannot help out. Nothing you're saying here indicates that the work she is being asked to do is specifically physically difficult, either. \n\nUltimately, it is her body and she has to draw those lines.
