We do usually get along well but this is tanking our relationship.\n\nI'm getting married later this year. We don't have anything against kids but just want everything to go as smoothly as possible, and there's venue capacity, so we decided no kids under 10.\n\nAlice's daughter, my niece is currently 6 months (will be almost 1 by the time of the wedding). I could kind of understand if she was 8/9 (not at a disruptive age), but she's not. Alice demanded I allow her to bring her daughter, but I said no.\n\nSo now she told me she can't come to the wedding.\n\nI thought this was insane because both me and fiance have friends and family with young kids, arranging babysitting and making the effort to attend. I even offered Alice to get in touch with some of my friends and their trusted sitters. She refused.\n\nI kind of lost it at her and said she can't even make an effort to attend her own sister's wedding and has attachment issues. (also side note, earlier Alice also dropped out as one of my bridesmaids, which wasn't great but I understood.)\n\nShe got really pissed and is now refusing to talk to me. Parents are telling me to apologize to her for saying all that and I'm overreacting.\n\nEdit with some more info: Alice lives locally, she doesn't have to travel far. Babysitting would only be for an afternoon since she would be attending as a guest, not a bridesmaid. And she's very well off financially, one afternoon of babysitting money is not much. Even if that was the issue, her in laws live in the area and not attending my wedding so they could look after her for the time.", "created_utc": 1682603668, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130mx9x/aita_for_losing_it_at_my_sister_after_she_said/", "score": 1336, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All she knows is that the last 6 months have been the hardest of her life, and she would be foolish to underestimate how hard it would be to rock the boat with baby care (at which she is no expert, being a first-time mom!) at some unknown point in the near future.\n\nSpeaking from really painful experience: It is a nightmare to run back and forth to check on a little baby during a wedding, and even worse if you are still nursing and need to worry about either pumping or stepping out at the perfect time to meet baby's needs. When the baby is there, it gets fussy and you know it's time to nurse. When the baby is not there, you are tethered to a phone and constantly worrying that your baby will start screaming in hunger and will be miserable until you manage to get there, possibly with painfully engorged and leaking breasts, trying to enjoy being the only sober one in the room and not really in the mood to dance anyway.\n\nIf you want her there and want to forbid her from bringing the tiny human that depends on her 24/7, *you* should set everything up to make it happen and thank her profusely for putting up with your childless wedding rules. My close friends with childless weddings arranged to have babysitting at a room steps away from the wedding facility, at their expense, so that I could slip out and back in very quickly. And even that really significantly impinged on my enjoyment of the night. Although there's a limit to the fun you can have with a baby in tow, I had such a better time at the weddings that welcomed my baby, and I was never rude enough to allow the fussing to be a disruption. My husband and I just teamed up, and when it was a wedding for one of \"my people,\" he took over the lion's share of the baby duty, and vice versa.\n\nWhen she \"asked/demanded,\" perhaps she was trying to tell you that she would only be able to come if you allowed the baby there or worked very hard with her to make sure that the baby could be just steps away.", "lol this is such a crazy post \n\n\"im having a child free wedding, my sister with a child understandably says she's not coming unless her child is coming and now I'm mad\"\n\nETA: \n \njudgement is yta obviously, and it got even worse, her sister was recently widowed.

You for blowing up at your sister, your sister for demanding to bring her child and refusing to even consider childcare. I definitely understand not wanting to have children at your wedding and have been to many that did not allow them. As a parent, I prefer not to have my own kids at a wedding I'm attending anyway. They're a pain at an event like that. Your sister should at least consider the childcare option though but I get why she is reluctant, especially if it's her first child. Parents are REALLY protective of that first one and since this is a family wedding most the people she would trust to watch the child will probably be unavailable since they are at the wedding. I think you may need to just have a talk with your sister and explore options. For example, when my wife and I had our first child we had a family wedding to attend when he was 4 months old. We were uncomfortable leaving him with a sitter at the time so we rented an extra hotel room in the hotel where the reception was. We rotated between the two of us checking on him and having friends and family watch him. It made us more comfortable that he was in the care of people we knew and that we could check on him if we wanted. This might not be something that is possible for you but it just shows that there ARE options you can discuss. Even her coming alone and leaving the baby in the care of the husband. Also, 6 months down the road she may become more comfortable leaving the child with other people and decide to do that anyway. That first child is really hard", "Wow, you picked the wrong day to post OP. There's been similar AITA posts that always get N T A/N A H.\n\nI'm actually going to say ESH, but mainly the sister. OP slightly because it is your sister's choice whether she wants to come or not, so you can't really object to that.\n\nOP mentions in a comment that the sister lives locally, so it's not like she has to fly out or something. The kid will be close to 1, so not a newborn. I think for a few hours, for your own sister's wedding, you absolutely should be able to find a sitter. OP even offered to introduce her to some potential sitters, but sister refuses.\n\nHonestly, I don't think she considers you as someone close to her.

I could kind of understand if she was 8/9 (not at a disruptive age), but she'll be almost 1 by the time of the wedding. Alice asked/demanded I allow her to bring her daughter, but I said no. \n\nSo now she told me she can't come to the wedding.\n\nI thought this was insane because both me and fiance have friends and family with young kids, arranging babysitting and making the effort to attend. I even offered Alice to get in touch with some of my friends and their trusted sitters. She refused.\n\nI kind of lost it at her and said she can't even make an effort to attend her own sister's wedding and has attachment issues. (also side note, earlier Alice also dropped out as one of my bridesmaids, which wasn't great but I understood.)\n\nShe got really pissed and is now refusing to talk to me. Parents are telling me to apologize to her for saying all that and I'm overreacting.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is perfectly your right. However, you do need to realize that when you make that decision there are going to be people who straight up refuse to come based on that principle alone. There are going to be people who are not able to find a babysitter. There might be people in your sister's situation where they straight up refuse to get a babysitter. And that's perfectly reasonable as well. You don't get to get mad at them. You don't get to say that they are tanking your relationship with them, because they are prioritizing their child, a human being that they made and literally depends on them for everything, over you. That is not something you get to accuse them of. That is disrespectful. It was ultimately disrespectful of you to do that to your sister. To view your relationship with your sister in this way.\n\nsecond of all. Your sister is recently widowed. Meaning, that around the time of your wedding is going to be around the time of the 1-year anniversary of her husband passing. Meaning, that you will most likely be depressed and probably want to be around her child, you know the living breathing human being that she made with her now deceased husband, who probably helps remind her of her DEAD HUSBAND and brings her a little bit of joy/comfort (Not that I'm advocating for parents using their children for emotional support).\n\n third of all, you say that she is in a decent financial position right now. But keep in mind, that her husband just died. The other half of her household income has suddenly ceased. Unless he had life insurance, or any sort of money stashed away, she is now for the most part on her own. Yes I'm sure she will have a support network, but financially she is now responsible for everything. Which means that come time your wedding, she might not still be in the same financial position. She might not want to burden her in-laws around the anniversary of their son's death to watch her child so that she can go off and go party for the celebration of your marriage.\n\nAnd lastly, You are absolutely the most idiotic or dimwitted person to think that your sister might not be hurt or upset or depressed around the time of your wedding, you know a celebration of love and a life together that also is going to be happening around the anniversary of her dead husband's passing. Even if she did agree to go to the wedding now, who knows how she'll feel then. By that point she might decide that it's too much, she can't handle it, however her emotions are affecting her. Would you be upset with her then too? Would you expect her to sacrifice her comfort and her emotional well-being for your happiness? Knowing that she has a child to raise on her own? Knowing that doing so could potentially put her into a worse state of mind that would absolutely have repercussions no matter how big or small not only on her, but on her child? Potentially on you, as she might blame you in that eventuality? \n\nAll I'm seeing here is me me me me. I understand that it's your wedding, I understand it's a special day for you. But the rest of the world doesn't stop, other people's lives don't stop continuing just because you're getting married. That's something you need to get a quick grip on right now, before YOU are the one that damages your relationship with your sister, NOT the other way around.", "My god YTA. I was actually gonna say not the asshole because I had had a child free wedding and I feel like a sibling should put in the effort to attend given the low barrier for entry so to speak but *her husband died*. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine I would be even remotely functional after a couple months none the less want to be away from the only person that still has a connection to her deceased husband. \n\nHow selfish.", "Well I had already given my judgement before she shared that piece of information\u2026", "Omg what?!

I was just disagreeing with the notion that she\u2019d have to leave her child in a potentially abusive environment if strangers were the sitters.", "having an age limit isn\u2019t an issue at all here, it\u2019s the complete lack of empathy that OP seems to have for her sister who has a newborn infant and is recently widowed. if she doesn\u2019t want to make an exception then that\u2019s no one\u2019s prerogative but hers and her fianc\u00e9s but she really has no business reacting negatively to her sister\u2019s inability to attend", "Well, what age do you pick then? 18? 16? 21? Does it count if they turn that age that year or do they have to be any of those ages at the wedding?\n\nIt's rather random however one does it. She gave her reasons, they're fair enough.

I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave my baby with anyone out of fear. OP seriously lacks empathy.", "One of my husband's siblings is engaged and trying to get her wedding together right now. She doesn't want kids there, that's fine. Now she's asking people to book their hotel room two years in advance so they can get this castle venue/hotel. The only way they can get the venue is if they either pay to book all of the rooms in advance or guests book all of the rooms in advance. No. If you're telling me my kids can't come along I am not booking a hotel room 2 years in advance.", "There\u2019s definitely a newly prevalent idea that children only belong in child specific spaces, instead of just\u2026 in society. It\u2019s kind of wild to me, who grew up in a very integrated culture. Kids were everywhere growing up, that\u2019s how they learn to be adult humans. By being around adults. I worry for these isolated children when they hit maturity.", "I don't think anyone outside of the US thinks a child free wedding is a thing tbh.", "I totally get it if it's a cost thing. I've seen it happen more than once, especially on Reddit, where it isn't a cost issue. The couple just doesn't want kids at their wedding and then they get upset that a third of their guest list isn't coming because they don't want to or can't get a babysitter.", "You probably already know this, but if you have no intention of getting married and this is a long term partner go see an estate attorney to get a will and power of attorney set up!", "You can invite who you like, but people you exclude will feel excluded and thought less of.  You must undstand that.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Yes THANK YOU! I am so sick of all these child free wedding posts on this sub. So so so many and they are all the same.", "Exactly, what an adorable age. She could\u2019ve been involved lil flower girl spreading flower petals whatever  or just sit back looking like a princess. I would want my niece there. Especially  with it being such a monumental family event. Theres like a few exceptions when someone should break the rules and this is one.  Hopefully, she apologizes to both her sister & her niece and begs them to attend. She\u2019ll regret it one day when she\u2019s older and she\u2019s looking through her wedding photos and her niece asks her aunt why aren\u2019t I there? Wasn\u2019t I born? Hopefully she makes it right bc life\u2019s to short.", "Exactly! In this case it\u2019s publishing terminology that just happens to be a homophone with a word that might also make sense. It\u2019s no wonder most folks don\u2019t know about it, but it\u2019s always good to learn new things too!", "You\u2019re not wrong - either will do. It\u2019s a journalism term and they invented lede - I just found this out on another sub!", "Well, they are in my country too, but I can accept that not all countries are the same.\n\nYou don't see...any difference between a 17yo and a 4yo though? Why is your number not arbitrary but hers is?", "SHE JUST LOST HER HUSBAND! She doesn't want to attend a wedding!", "It's a wedding, not a court summons. Get over yourself.  Your wedding is only really important to you and your fiance.", "Being very well off means you can afford a sitter, not that you\u2019re comfortable with every sitter you meet. \n\nCurious, is your sister being very well-off at all related to her husband\u2019s death (insurance etc) or his family?", "Is she well off financially due to the **VERY RECENT LOSS OF HER HUSBAND??? YOUR BIL!!!!** Or are you truly that dense that you can truly look past that? Pull your head out of your rear. Welcome to earth, ya rude asshole.", "That and the \" not having a plus one\"\nExcept during pandemic where numbers were extremely  limited, I've never heard of not allowing plus 1", "My fianc\u00e9 and I aren\u2019t inviting kids to our wedding. His best friend has a daughter who will be six, and even the best friend said \u201cDon\u2019t invite kids.\u201d", "This has been on my to do list for this year actually! I have a home and a business and my three kitty cats so I\u2019ve been working on what I\u2019d like to happen with all of that if something happens to me. It\u2019s definitely a priority to get taken care of this year after I had a near death accident last year. Im finally in a place where I can work on my future again.", "[removed]", "Maybe her in laws aren't up for baby sitting because they also are grieving the death of their own son. Have you stopped to think about a single person other then yourself? Your wedding is an important day in YOUR life, no one else's. Your sister is a very recent young widow who is also an unexpected single mom....do you not care about her at all? Who in the world thinks it is normal to prioritize a party over intense grief? What is wrong with you?", "That\u2019s her prerogative. You chose to have a children over 10 rule for your wedding and you should also accept there are some parents who will choose not to come because of it. You don\u2019t get to be pissed off because she decided she can\u2019t come because of it, YTA", "Hopefully you have taken a fraction of the voluminous comments to heart. You\u2019re not only TA, you\u2019re in the running for TA of the year.\n\nThat said\u2026 \n\nApologize to your sister. You have gone batcrap wedding crazy. Ask if she would be ok with it if her in laws attended the wedding and waited outside of the ceremony itself with the baby so your sister can be present. Then everyone joins for the reception. That group can leave early if they wish. \n\nIf someone questions your exception, you go ahead tell them to f right off and you will be putting your family\u2019s needs above your desires on this subject. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a child free wedding, but there are times when empathy and family need to come ahead of that desire. This is one of those times.", "It's a very difficult situation asking the in-laws of your recently dead husband for baby-sitting help. You don't know how they are dealing with his death.", "Trusted by you and your friends. That means nothing to your sister. I trust no one other than my parents or my in laws with my kid until she\u2019s old enough to talk/tell me about what happened while I was gone. \n\nAlso her husband JUST died.", "Sorry I realise this didn\u2019t come across how it sounds. OP has behaved terribly."]}
