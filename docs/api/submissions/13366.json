He drove there in a separate car and met his mother and I at the dinner. The dinner started at around 7. My son let us know he was planning to head home at around 8:30 or 9:00 pm.\n\nAt 8:45, my son came over and let me know he was heading home. He asked if I wanted a ride, because his mom tends to stay late at parties like this and I leave earlier. I told him I'd leave with him, but asked him to wait 15 minutes while we completed prayer (this was a Ramadan dinner). He seemed okay with it, and joined us for the prayer.\n\nNow, here's where I may be TA. After we prayed, the host announced that they wanted to do an additional Ramadan prayer. (this prayer is optional, but is about 3 times as long as the first prayer we did). My son looked at me and said \"Okay, let's go now?\"\n\nBut I felt it would be rude  that the host and the other men were staying to pray longer, so I told him we should stay instead. Part of me was also grateful for the opportunity to pray extra. He looked annoyed, and like he wanted to just leave me there, but he ended up staying. All in all, it took a while, and we ended up leaving at 10 pm.\n\nWhen we finally got in the car, he asked what I was thinking and why I made him stay so long. I told him it would have been rude to leave once the men had already started praying, and that the situation gave us no choice. I also told him he should have just left without me if he wanted to go so badly. He said that actually he couldn't leave, because he made a commitment to take me home, and he's a man of his word. I think this is all his fault for sticking around if he didn't want to.\n\nHe told me I could have just said I had an early morning at work and left, and now he's going off about how, \"Yet again, we put his needs absolutely last, and that we accommodate strangers and other family members way before we ever think about him.\" I think he's being a bit dramatic, and he has a tendency to blame other people for his own problems. Why didn't he just leave? He had the car keys.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679954350, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12425un/aita_for_making_my_son_wait_an_extra_hour_and/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
