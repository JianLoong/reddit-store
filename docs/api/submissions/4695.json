We each have 3 children from previous relationships. I have literally burnt myself out from going above and beyond to do everything and be what everyone needed. I cooked, cleaned, emotionally, mental and financially supported everyone for 3 years. Our children are aged between 8-15 and I have made sure birthdays, Christmas and everything in between are special and the children are looked afer and loved. I also work full time. My eldest stepdaughter (15) has a track record of lying and making serious accusations against anyone who poses a threat to what she wants to the point where we have had child protection and police involvement. At first I took what she said seriously and supported her with the trauma she claimed to have gone through, until it was clear she was lying and had a pattern to her behaviours. Each time she accuses someone, I am the one who basically has the receipts for timeframes, behaviours and inconsistencies and have had to prove the innocence of the people she accuses. My own children, her father and even her siblings being amongst those she has tried to lie about. Even through all of this I have remained neutral towards her and sought counselling, medical appointments and school support to help her process her emotions and get to the bottom of the issue. Her mother was mentally ill when I came into the picture and could not cope with the demands of being a parent. During that time I made sure all of my step children's needs were met and went out of my way to make sure they felt loved and cared for, while my partner buried himself in work because he didn't know how to deal with any of it. At no point have I ever spoken badly about their mother to them nor have I tried to replace her. The issue is now that my stepdaughter realises that she can't lie to me or manipulate me, she has decided to move in with her mum and blames it on not liking me. She has not spoken a word to me since she moved out but continuesto say she doesn'tlike me. Today was her birthday. Normally I would go out of my way to buy presents, decorations and cook for her. She told her dad that she wanted a home cooked meal at our house. When he told me this just last night, I said to him that we haven't had a proper discussion about rules and boundaries for her to help prevent the perpetuation of her lies. He told me I was being an asshole and refused to discuss it firther. Today, I refused to participate in her birthday dinner or sing her happy birthday. I kept my distance and made myself scarce. I explained to my partner that I was not going to play happy families and participate in her birthday dinner when she only speaks to him or wants to be around us when she wants us to pay for things.

It sounds like she has 2 not good parents with trauma from a mom that was not mentally well enough to take care of her and a dad who is disinterested in her.  She clearly needs help and therapy. Being a parent means unconditional love and can be a thankless job. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019re hurt, but using her birthday to take a stand against a child and basically saying well I don\u2019t like you either, is cruel.

Her bio parents will give her a lecture and then wait for the drama to die out. My issue was that nothing was actually being addressed and she showed no empathy or remorse for her actions and wasn't being made accountable. As long as she does her chores and keeps up her grades at school, she's ok according to them.

She received a lot of attention after her first serious accusation when she was 11 because obv everyone wanted to show their love and support. It got worse after that but now even the her school and the police have a record of all of her allegations and have spoken to her about the seriousness of her actions. She made up rumours about a male teacher which caused an investigation of him. She made up lies about her dad and he was investigated. She's made up stories about multiple boys at school. But no medical professional will assess her for anything more than neurodivergency because they refuse to diagnose her at this age with anything deeper. She refused to participate in her therapy sessions once she realised that they weren't going to act on her stories anymore.", "I think you're spot on.", "I am a teacher who specialises in working with teenagers with behavioural issues. I understand brain development and disorders that present particular behaviours which is why I have spent so much time and energy trying to support her. She's too young to be diagnosed with a personality disorder and has been dismissed by medical professionals for this reason. When I tried pushing my partner to do more to get her diagnosed or create clear boundaries with real consequences, I was told that it wasn't my place and to back off. So I very hesitantly did. But still observed and expressed my concerns when I noticed anything concerning. He still thinks that ITA and has threatened to end our relationship over the dinner.", "*sigh* Working mostly. He does try his best in the ways that he knows how. Generally, by showing affection and buying her things or giving her money for chores. Takes her to appointments  etc. But he struggles with rectifying behaviours and tends to use his childhood as a guide - very old school. I put my whole heart and soul into providing for all of our children as equally as possible so I think I deserve a little appreciation, maybe it's a little vain of me but it's true.", "You:\n\n>She clearly needs help and therapy.\n\n\nOp:\n>She refused to participate in her therapy sessions once she realised that they weren't going to act on her stories anymore.\n\n\nYou:\n>Being a parent means unconditional love and can be a thankless job\n\nOp= stepparent and I say thus because there is only so much Op can do.

You\u2019re absolutely right though, and she\u2019s running out of time to learn and grow where the consequences of poor behaviors are still relatively minor for her. The consequences for anyone trapped in her lies aren\u2019t small, and thank goodness you\u2019ve been so diligent on keeping track of things, but this is no way for you or your children to live. This is your background. This is what you are trained to do.

I have no doubt you have quite the collection of records, having that all in his face at once may be a reality check.

You can\u2019t control either of them. You can only control yourself. Think about the toxic environment your own children are growing up in. It\u2019s your job to protect them. They\u2019re going to grow up thinking all this is normal and might either perpetuate it or accept it in a future relationship.", "NTA\n\nChances are very high you have a budding personality disorder on your hands. Protect yourself, protect your children. Also wedge a boot up your husband's arse and tell him to parent his child.", "NTA but her mom and dad aren\u2019t doing her any favors.
