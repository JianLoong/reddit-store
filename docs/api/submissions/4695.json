We each have 3 children from previous relationships. I have literally burnt myself out from going above and beyond to do everything and be what everyone needed. I cooked, cleaned, emotionally, mental and financially supported everyone for 3 years. Our children are aged between 8-15 and I have made sure birthdays, Christmas and everything in between are special and the children are looked afer and loved. I also work full time. My eldest stepdaughter (15) has a track record of lying and making serious accusations against anyone who poses a threat to what she wants to the point where we have had child protection and police involvement. At first I took what she said seriously and supported her with the trauma she claimed to have gone through, until it was clear she was lying and had a pattern to her behaviours. Each time she accuses someone, I am the one who basically has the receipts for timeframes, behaviours and inconsistencies and have had to prove the innocence of the people she accuses. My own children, her father and even her siblings being amongst those she has tried to lie about. Even through all of this I have remained neutral towards her and sought counselling, medical appointments and school support to help her process her emotions and get to the bottom of the issue. Her mother was mentally ill when I came into the picture and could not cope with the demands of being a parent. During that time I made sure all of my step children's needs were met and went out of my way to make sure they felt loved and cared for, while my partner buried himself in work because he didn't know how to deal with any of it. At no point have I ever spoken badly about their mother to them nor have I tried to replace her. The issue is now that my stepdaughter realises that she can't lie to me or manipulate me, she has decided to move in with her mum and blames it on not liking me. She has not spoken a word to me since she moved out but continues to say she doesn'tlike me. Today was her birthday. Normally I would go out of my way to buy presents, decorations and cook for her. She told her dad that she wanted a home cooked meal at our house. When he told me this just last night, I said to him that we haven't had a proper discussion about rules and boundaries for her to help prevent the perpetuation of her lies. He told me I was being an asshole and refused to discuss it further. Today, I refused to participate in her birthday dinner or sing her happy birthday. I kept my distance and made myself scarce. I explained to my partner that I was not going to play happy families and participate in her birthday dinner when she only speaks to him or wants to be around us when she wants us to pay for things.

It got worse after that but now even the her school and the police have a record of all of her allegations and have spoken to her about the seriousness of her actions. She made up rumours about a male teacher which caused an investigation of him. She made up lies about her dad and he was investigated. She's made up stories about multiple boys at school.

I wish you the best. This sounds like ny ex wife and I still living together because its too expensive to do it alone. Luckily we have a relatively good relationship and remain good friends and parents.", "Ma\u2019am it sounds like you have 7 children and not 6. Your husband should spend more time with the kids to remind himself that he\u2019s actually their father instead of sticking his head in the sand to ignore a very real problem that could hurt his child, the family as a whole and the next stranger she tries to lie about. Crying wolf one too many times never ends on a good way for all involved.", "NTA, but you need to take a hard look at if both you and your husband are expected to put forth the same amount of effort and respect to your kids.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, we had to move out of my childhood home, and we moved into my mom then boyfriend's house. Both my mom and him had two girls, my sister and his oldest daughter being the same age and off to college already. That means it was me, my mom, him, and his youngest daughter. And boy howdy, did she make things difficult. She lied, she stole, she did drugs, etc. One time my mom and him were out looking for her all night and found her hiding in her friend's closet. Next day, my mom went to work on no sleep. What was the daughter doing? Sleeping, because my mom's boyfriend thought it would be mean to send her to school when she had gotten so little sleep the night before. Anywho this plus a whole bunch of other things triggered a depressive episode in me so my mom moved us out. \n\nLike you, my mom didn't feel like it was her place to parent her boyfriend's kids, so she didn't says anything to him about it. But in case you haven't noticed, her boyfriend wasn't particularly good at disciplining his child. Eventually the daughter either moved or went off to college, I don't remember which. And my mom and him got married in Hawaii. They were fighting by the end of the trip and TOOK SEPARATE CABS TO THE AIRPORT ON OUR WAY HOME. What was the fight about? Yep, my new stepsister. \n\nTen years ago by, and they end up getting divorced. What was a major contributor to it? My now ex-stepdad's unwillingness to ever discipline or set boundaries with his daughter, and expecting my mom to just put up with any disrespect that got thrown at her. And after over a decade of biting her tongue, my mom was freaking done. \n\nThe moral of the story, is that it's not just about your stepdaughter. It's also hugely about how your husband handles your stepdaughter. Is he willing to discipline her? Or are you just expected to put up with it? Because if you think it's bad now, imagine how you'll feel about it in ten years if nothing changes.", "Edited to add the person Id listen to as I didn\u2019t reply to the comment\u2026\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlnyjc/aita_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my/j080s9h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3\n\nI would listen to this person and try and frame it differently. \n\nIt sounds like you are the first person to provide consistency, boundary and unconditional support to your step child. So it\u2019s natural she\u2019s testing that boundary. \n\nWhether there is something more significant in terms of abuse. Or if that abuse was the parenting of her poorly Mum and avoidant father is important but not necessarily for you to work out. \n\nYou reached the end of your tether because you are carrying EVERYTHING and being the only parent for all kids. You decided to absent yourself because that is a lot. NTA.\n\nBut this child needs consistent adult support and love. And if you no longer want to be the person to provide that (and absolutely NTA if you decide that. She isn\u2019t your child and that\u2019s a lot to take on) then there needs to be a very serious intervention with your husband and his ex wife to determine their role and agree strategies together. \n\nThe more division there is between the three of you the more harm you are causing a kid who is obviously hurting a lot. \n\nThis is tough. You are awesome for having done as much as you have.", "So basically your husband needed a parent for his kids so he didn't have to and now that you are forcing him to step up he is noy happy.\n\nNTA, but you need to do something about the husband.", "NTA", "NTA - it does sound like your husband is using you though.", "LoL a match made in heaven", "NTA, but your husband is a lousy parent and partner, not to mention emotionally abusive. How much does *he* do for *your* kids?", "NTA for not participating in the dinner. Because the disagreement between your husband and you should not ruin her birthday.\n\nBut both you and your husband are very much YTA.\nBecause the two of you do not agree on how to handle raising her. The way you describe how he is doing everything wrong (like burying himself in work and not giving her consequences the way -you- feel it should be done). And him calling you a \"spiteful child\".\nThis does not sound like a good dymanic. Your husband and you should really work this out, and reach an agreement. On how to handle all your (steph)children. As long as that's not solved, small issues (like how and where to celebrate birthday dinner) will keep happening.", "INFO: you went above and beyond but... What does your husband do for you, your children and his? Does he do something other than work?", "Something is not adding up with this story.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time a youngster who is trying to tell their truth has been accused of lying.\n\nWhy did the child choose to live with her bio mum if she is mentally unwell? Why did that seem like a better option to her?\n\nI\u2019d be very interested to hear the other side.", "So your husband is literally mad at you for doing what he\u2019s done for 4 years. NTA but he is"]}
