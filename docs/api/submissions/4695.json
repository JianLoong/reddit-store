I cooked, cleaned, emotionally, mental and financially supported everyone for 3 years. Our children are aged between 8-15 and I have made sure birthdays, Christmas and everything in between are special and the children are looked afer and loved. I also work full time. My eldest stepdaughter (15) has a track record of lying and making serious accusations against anyone who poses a threat to what she wants to the point where we have had child protection and police involvement. At first I took what she said seriously and supported her with the trauma she claimed to have gone through, until it was clear she was lying and had a pattern to her behaviours. Each time she accuses someone, I am the one who basically has the receipts for timeframes, behaviours and inconsistencies and have had to prove the innocence of the people she accuses. My own children, her father and even her siblings being amongst those she has tried to lie about. Even through all of this I have remained neutral towards her and sought counselling, medical appointments and school support to help her process her emotions and get to the bottom of the issue. Her mother was mentally ill when I came into the picture and could not cope with the demands of being a parent. During that time I made sure all of my step children's needs were met and went out of my way to make sure they felt loved and cared for, while my partner buried himself in work because he didn't know how to deal with any of it. At no point have I ever spoken badly about their mother to them nor have I tried to replace her. The issue is now that my stepdaughter realises that she can't lie to me or manipulate me, she has decided to move in with her mum and blames it on not liking me. She has not spoken a word to me since she moved out but continuesto say she doesn'tlike me. Today was her birthday. Normally I would go out of my way to buy presents, decorations and cook for her. She told her dad that she wanted a home cooked meal at our house. When he told me this just last night, I said to him that we haven't had a proper discussion about rules and boundaries for her to help prevent the perpetuation of her lies. He told me I was being an asshole and refused to discuss it firther. Today, I refused to participate in her birthday dinner or sing her happy birthday. I kept my distance and made myself scarce.

If she can't stop trying to destroy people she should probably be committed before she makes herself a target.", "For real. Makes you wonder just how \u201cmentally ill\u201d the ex is and how she got that way. Being everything for everyone is surely the path towards losing your mind.", "He did. Struggled to find the ingredients in the pantry because he hardly goes in there, but he did the cooking.", "It's never too late for counseling.  \n\nOne may regret the time it took to make counseling happen, but the counseling itself can be productive.", "I did not cook. I stayed late at work, then went home, poured a drink, and worked on my little side project. A little bit of role reversal!", "I have to disagree that this kid's only trauma is her parents' divorce.  Having a mentally ill mother and a checked out dad can be very damaging, and that all happened before you arrived on the scene.\n\nYou (and we at reddit) don't have specific info on bio mom's mental illness.  Was its manifestation recent or has it always been a factor in how this daughter was parented and cared for?  Was your now husband so checked out of his first marriage that he didn't notice when his wife's mental illness began to affect her mothering?  Frankly, I would not trust him as a historian for his ex-wife's coping and his daughter's troubled state.   He has a history of not being engaged with family dynamics.  It sounds like the daughter desperately wants her dad's attention.  Your husband needs to show up as a parent.  This 15 year old is the squeaky wheel, but how are his other kids REALLY doing?  How are YOUR kids doing with all this turmoil?", "I'm sorry you are going thru this. NTA. I beg you to consider how this is affecting your kids. You seem to be bending over backward for 3 yrs for his daughters behavior trying to get her help. What are you doing for your own children? Are they going to resent growing up in this setting? Are they going to be angry with you for tending to your partners child over their own needs?? And I say this because there is no possible way that your 3 kids are going thru all of this without some sort of negative feelings on their own part. It's time to put you and your kids first. Let the bios figure out the daughter on their own and get yourself and your kids somewhere safe. And I say somewhere safe, because there is NO WAY that your kids feel safe in your house with that other child's behavior. You're risking your own kids' health and mental well-being as well as your future relationships with them. I can 100% say your kids are not going to want the drama of all this once they are old enough to have a say in it. Ask yourself what your kids' graduations, weddings, baby showers, parties are going to look like, and how you and your partner are going to react when they don't want his daughter involved in their lives. Failure to protect your children going forward would definitely make me reconsider my judgment.", "HA! And he thinks he can handle her on his own? Pull up a chair and popcorn and see how that goes down!", "Good for you!", "NTA \n\nWell done OP\n\nYou should not be the workhorse holding everything together through the hard parts while your husband joins to be \u2018fun parent\u2019. \n\nI do strongly agree with the suggestion of therapy. Perhaps you go by yourself then expand to couples therapy. \n\nAnd if husband declares he will not consider therapy then sadly I suggest your next consult be with an attorney.", "\ud83c\udfc6", "Bingo!", "It may be blessing to OP (and obviously, Dad) to have the daughter living at Mom's, but this doesn't address what the 15 year old needs from her parents.  She's the child that really needs the help before she grows up into a very troubled, unstable adult.", "Make copies of all that stuff before giving it to him so that her own kids are protected when his dear daughter makes accusations against her kids. And it's just a matter of time before it happens."]}
