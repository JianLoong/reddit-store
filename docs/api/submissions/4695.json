We each have 3 children from previous relationships. I have literally burnt myself out from going above and beyond to do everything and be what everyone needed. I cooked, cleaned, emotionally, mental and financially supported everyone for 3 years. Our children are aged between 8-15 and I have made sure birthdays, Christmas and everything in between are special and the children are looked afer and loved. I also work full time. My eldest stepdaughter (15) has a track record of lying and making serious accusations against anyone who poses a threat to what she wants to the point where we have had child protection and police involvement. At first I took what she said seriously and supported her with the trauma she claimed to have gone through, until it was clear she was lying and had a pattern to her behaviours. Each time she accuses someone, I am the one who basically has the receipts for timeframes, behaviours and inconsistencies and have had to prove the innocence of the people she accuses. My own children, her father and even her siblings being amongst those she has tried to lie about. Even through all of this I have remained neutral towards her and sought counselling, medical appointments and school support to help her process her emotions and get to the bottom of the issue. Her mother was mentally ill when I came into the picture and could not cope with the demands of being a parent. During that time I made sure all of my step children's needs were met and went out of my way to make sure they felt loved and cared for, while my partner buried himself in work because he didn't know how to deal with any of it. At no point have I ever spoken badly about their mother to them nor have I tried to replace her. The issue is now that my stepdaughter realises that she can't lie to me or manipulate me, she has decided to move in with her mum and blames it on not liking me. She has not spoken a word to me since she moved out but continuesto say she doesn'tlike me. Today was her birthday. Normally I would go out of my way to buy presents, decorations and cook for her. She told her dad that she wanted a home cooked meal at our house. When he told me this just last night, I said to him that we haven't had a proper discussion about rules and boundaries for her to help prevent the perpetuation of her lies. He told me I was being an asshole and refused to discuss it firther. Today, I refused to participate in her birthday dinner or sing her happy birthday. I kept my distance and made myself scarce. I explained to my partner that I was not going to play happy families and participate in her birthday dinner when she only speaks to him or wants to be around us when she wants us to pay for things.

And your point exactly?", "OP needs to visit with a lawyer to figure out how to protect herself, her family and other people.", "Has this girl ever gone to therapy? This is ringing a lot of alarm bells in my head.", "Please protect yourself and your children from her. I think it\u2019s time to separate your family from your husband\u2019s family, especially since he doesn\u2019t help in anyway, he\u2019ll he barely acknowledges her having a problem. She is on her way to some serious issues in the future and your children are entitled to a fighting chance of normalcy and life!!!", "> He still thinks that ITA and has threatened to end our relationship over the dinner.\n\nFor your children\u2019s well-being and safety this is likely for the best. Your husband is a shitty father and partner.", "Bring up to him the fact she claims you alone are the reason she moved in with mom. So why on earth would you have dinner or be around her in general when she claims she dislikes you so much she physically packed up and moved out.", "Seeing how this is a 15 year old teenage girl? Yeah. She has fucking issues.", "He didn't really try his best though. It sounds like he did the minimum and left you to do everything else. That isn't fair to you.", "It\u2019s not vain. Why are you putting up with this? He sounds like he married you to be the housekeeper and nanny. You don\u2019t need his support. Why don\u2019t you just move out of that ridiculous situation you are putting yourself and your kids into? You\u2019re not doing good by your children being this girls savior.", "It sounds like your husband is just throwing money at the problem and your stepdaughter is acting out as a way to get attention from her father. \n\nYour husband needs to act like a father.

The daughter chose to live with her mom - dad and OP didn\u2019t send her away. And he saw her today, on her birthday, despite OP refusing to participate. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty good evidence that he\u2019ll continue seeing her and that he didn\u2019t choose OP over the daughter.", "I mean, she made false allegations against dad to the point of there being an investigation and CPS involvement, and there were no consequences from the parents. How do you continue to support that? How is it OP\u2019s responsibility, as a step parent, to maintain a family after that?", "...You do realize she's probably here because she DOES love her step kids but is at her wit's end right?", "That\u2019s\u2026 not what the comment said. It said there\u2019s only so much OP can do. Like legally, re therapy, punishment, etc.", "She didn\u2019t even refuse to see her.
