He knows what she's doing is toxic, but we moved back to a small/midsized town and it's been much more difficult to find people we vibe with here, so having her as a social proxy has been really helpful for him.\n\nMitch had some mental health issues during the lockdown due to not being able to get out and see people, so I see Alice as the lesser of two evils. Mitch knows where I stand though, so if her ever cheated on me, even emotionally, with Alice, we'd be done in a heartbeat.

There is a reason he is always so forgiving towards her, he doesn't have your back and he is obviously the last from his friend group holding to her. I am not telling, they are still FWB. But I am telling, this FWB thing still influences him. If your partner is not prioritizing you, his spouse, it would be a deal breaker for the most people. And him still holding to her is concerning as hell.\n\nPS: It is your choice to forgive her, but you dont owe it to her. Nor to your hubby. But you say, she still did not say a word of apology, so why should you at all?\n\n\n\nETA: If someone looks bad in an age-gap-relationship, it is always the older part.
