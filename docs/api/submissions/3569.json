He told her he didn't want to hear anymore of her opinions about me, but she didn't stop talking to all the rest of their friend group. I didn't want him to lose all his friends and he is a great guy, so I sucked it up and kept going to all of these functions, hoping to show them I wasn't a bad person, and it worked for the most part, apart from Alice, who still acts cold and demeaning toward me.\n\nTheir friend group has since been separated as people move away for work or family and only a few of the group remain.

She has no friends?  I wonder why /s\n\nI would question why hubby is taking her side over yours.  Did they ever have a romantic relationship?", "NTA and I'd be questioning your husband's motives towards her.  She is probably jealous of you as she wants him.  Your husband either likes her attention or feels bad about not choosing her or is manipulating the situation.\n\nThere's a reason Alice has no friends.\n\nYour husband needs to be on your side.  If he's not with you, he's with her so you may need to look a little closer at your relationship and decide whether you want to be with someone who is happy for another person that makes his partner feel bad.", "NTA\n\n> Mitch is saying that Alice has lost most of her friends, is in an unhappy relationship, and only ever said the stuff she did out of jealousy and pettiness and I should be the bigger person and go, but I won't budge.\n\nSo is she in a better place now, because going isn't being the better person, it's letting yourself be drawn back into a toxic environment.\n\nMitch is deeply in the wrong, from your description of Alice's behavior there's very good reason that Alice has lost most of her friends.", "NTA for not wanting to go where an enemy is hosting.  It's so easy for your husband to rationalize Alice's behavior and how because she's unhappy and friendless (thank god for poetic justice!), that \"you should be the bigger person.\"\n\nThat's up to you, and when if ever, that'll feel comfortable for you.  \n\nYour husband should consider himself lucky that you are already being generous in your wanting him to keep his old friends.  But he should respect that you need to recuse yourself so you don't get treated badly.  \n\nAlice sounds like the petty type who'll make it a point to gush over some people in front of you and then cut you dead so you'll feel awful.", "I broke up with a really great guy because one of his friends did something like that to me.\n\nNTA.", "And even if Alice does apologize, be wary.  She could just be trying to look good to others (including your husband). \n\nSomething says that Alice won't be sincerely sorry for stirring up your husband into thinking that you are a bad partner, and her other unkindness towards you.\n\nThe good thing is, Alice seems to be on a winning streak for losing friends, who probably see through her!", "Because the kinds of people who expect everyone else to let it go and be the bigger person are always causing problems.\n\nPeople who aren\u2019t troublemakers don\u2019t always need to develop that behavior", "NTA You need to have a proper talk with your husband about this. you have taken the abuse from this woman because you didnt want him to lose friends as she was queen bee. He stopped her bad mouthing you to him but not other people. \n\nYou need to ask him why Alice's feeling are more important that yours. Why she gets to treat you badly but you are expected to be the bigger person. Why her being in an unhappy relationship is your problem as on many occasions she has made you unhappy in your relationship because your husband picked her feeling over yours. \n\nIts a hard conversation, i had to have this with my husband over his FBF when we started dating but once we were both on the same page and tackled the issue as a couple I ended up with a very good friend in her myself once she realised hubby alway had my back.", "NTa.  And to be quite Fran I would not be happy at his going to her functions.  My husband\u2019s of work would do lunches, it was basically retired people, no spouses.  He stopped going because I was not included.  I didn\u2019t retire from there but I had worked there and worked and was friendly with all of them.  It just pissed him off.", "NTA. He shouldn't be demanding that you turn the other cheek, he should be sticking up for you. Plus, there's the fact that she's apparently lost most of her friends.\n\nMaybe because she gossiped about everyone behind their back?", "NTA. But why is your husband so insistent that you should be the bigger person and make Alice feel better about her life BY ALLOWING HER TO TEAR YOU DOWN?? WTF?", "Info \n\nYou do realize that while Alice herself is an issues, the real problem is your husband's inability to tell someone who bad-mouthes the woman he loves to fuck off, right? \n\nLike Alice shouldn't talk about you, sure. But your husband should've shut that down long time ago. The fact YOU had to TELL him that he should defend you, and only then did he grow some balls is so insulting. \n\nSo no, you're not the asshole for not wanting to go. Alice is an asshole but your husband is the biggest asshole here and also a coward. \n\nAlso maybe your husband should stop defending someone who insults his own wife and also question *why* Alice is so alone.", "If I would have an award I would give it to you . \n\ud83e\udd42\ud83c\udfc6", "I didn't think it was relevant to this specific situation, but yes, I assume her hostile behavior stemmed from the fact that they were FWB before we got together. But they weren't serious at all and both slept around during that time.\n\nThe main thing that irked her though is she thought I was a young golddigger. I was 20 and just dropped out of university, for external circumstances beyond my control, and was working low wage jobs at the time, whereas Mitch was 26 and settled into a well-paying career when we met.\n\nI mean, I can maybe understand her concerns of the age gap when we met or some momentary jealousy, but it's the persistence of her behavior and the insinuation that I'm a gold digger that really rubs me the wrong way. Again, if she had apologized, I would've swept it under the rug and called it bygones, but yeah...", "I mean, that's fair. \ud83d\ude0f But she needs to let it go.", "1000% this", "Copied from another response.\n\n'I didn't think it was relevant to this specific situation, but yes, I assume her hostile behavior stemmed from the fact that they were FWB before we got together. But they weren't serious at all and both slept around during that time.'\n\nThat being said, he shut her down after we got together, so she knows where he stands in that regard. But I think he just feels like if he dismisses her outright that he won't get invited to events anymore since she's the one that primarily plans them.", "This is something that resonates. Everyone agrees that you can't tell her anything without everyone knowing. She's like a walking public bulletin, which people either love or hate. Personally, I'm not a fan unless it's topical, like did you hear so-and-so are engaged, not private confidential info that most people would balk at.\n\nBut, to be fair, I don't know what's been happening for her to have lost so many friends recently, I didn't care to ask.", "Thanks, I consider myself awarded \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d", "I have a few guesses, and none of them paint a charitable picture of her as a person.\n\n1. She tried to sabotage all her friend's relationships the same way she attempted to sabotage the relationship between you and Mitch.\n2. You aren't the only one she talks trash about behind their back. She does that to everyone.\n3. She's been trying to get her male friends to cheat on their significant others.\n\nOr maybe it's a fourth option \u2014 that emotionally, she still behaves like she's in high school, and her friends simply got tired of dealing with petty, childish drama in their adult lives.\n\nEither way, my original statement stands. I know for my part, I no longer have the energy to deal with anyone I can't trust. And someone who would spread around things I said in confidence and spread hurtful gossip is **not** someone who can be trusted.", "NTA - AGAIN the person being wronged is being told to be the bigger person in order keep the AH happy !!", "Why is your husband still friends with someone he used to sleep with.  And why is he asking you to go to her parties and take her abuse", "Is your husband in love with her or what?? NTA.. But you should leave him.", "Husband remaining friends with a previous fwb isn't always a problem but in this case it absolutely is.\n\nThat previous connection is the main reason they are still friends, the residual feelings they shared are the anchor of this friendship, in a complete platonic friendship her actions should and would cause him to drop all contact when she attacked his gf/wife. The other friends did and I'm guessing that's because none of them had sex with her.\n\nHe could of still seen his other friends one on one while limiting/dropping time with her, it didn't have to be an all or nothing situation, and now you should be the bigger person and ignore everything she did to you when he only spoke up because you asked, it should have happened instantly without him having to be told, he's let you down, he's put their friendship and their history above you, your feelings and your marriage imo. \n\nI'm surprised this hasn't been a bigger issue sooner to be honest.\n\nEdit. NTA . Obviously.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband needs to rethink his position - who is his wife? Where does his first loyalty lie? I wouldn't set foot in that woman's house. She can reap the rewards of being an unkind person.", "Born 6 years apart, destined to fail.  Chinese astrology.", "So she clearly acted out from jealousy, and bitterness. She might have entertained the idea they could have been more. She might resent you as you\u2019re the living proof he wasn\u2019t unwilling to be in a relationship, just not with her, quite a blow for her ego - and you have nothing to do with it.\n\nIts up to her to decide to be happy for her friend, take action to change what doesn\u2019t make her happy, and not take it as rubbing her own failures. \n\nThe fact she settled down in an unhappy relationship while he is with you, must make her feel like she screwed up in her choices. Her bitterness can\u2019t be for nothing with others windrowing from her life. It\u2019s on her, however more easy to target you, than having to take responsibility for her own behaviour and choices. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to subject yourself to her unhappy self, nor have to keep trying -as it have to come both way. You deserve to respect yourself and avoid the one who won\u2019t.", "That is definitely relevant. NTA, she needs to grow up."]}
