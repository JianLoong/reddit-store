Did they ever have a romantic relationship?", "NTA and I'd be questioning your husband's motives towards her.  She is probably jealous of you as she wants him.  Your husband either likes her attention or feels bad about not choosing her or is manipulating the situation.\n\nThere's a reason Alice has no friends.\n\nYour husband needs to be on your side.

She could just be trying to look good to others (including your husband). \n\nSomething says that Alice won't be sincerely sorry for stirring up your husband into thinking that you are a bad partner, and her other unkindness towards you.\n\nThe good thing is, Alice seems to be on a winning streak for losing friends, who probably see through her!", "Because the kinds of people who expect everyone else to let it go and be the bigger person are always causing problems.\n\nPeople who aren\u2019t troublemakers don\u2019t always need to develop that behavior"]}
