It was her birthday last week and I spent the past few months planning everything for the day, as well as her actual party, which is next week. On the day, I organised balloons and cake for her classmates and friends and had everything delivered at school, including her first gift. I wished her a happy birthday and told her I loved her and she replied with an okay, which I felt was strange. I didn't get a thank you for anything, either. Later on that day, I found out that her mom had come home and surprised her with a dinner or something and effectively told everyone that the party I had planned was cancelled because she had made better plans for her daughter. I was a bit taken aback by this because my partner had been in constant communication with his bm and let her know what my plans were long before I started putting deposits down for the venues, games, activities, etc. I spoke to Anne to ask her what was going on and she told me that she was no longer interested in the party and wanted to spend time with her mom. I told her that her mom was more than welcome to attend the party next week and I would stay home but she turned that suggestion down as well and she hasn't replied to any of my messages or calls since then. I'm feeling a bit upset by this as I've lost thousands in deposits but mostly, I put a lot of work and effort into the planning, only to be snubbed at the last minute. Her dad works unusual hours so I do 90% of everything for her from PTA meetings, fundraisers, homework, pickups and drop-offs, doctors visits, etc and I do this because I love her but idk if I can keep taking this because it happens every time her mom visits, then when she leaves, Anne starts talking to me again. I understand that she's a child and misses her mother dearly and that's why I even pay for her flight tickets to visit her as well as resources for international calls but I'm also human.

My partner and I have had multiple conversations with Anne in the past about respecting our efforts and allllll of that and during our latest conversation, she told me that I need to remember that I\u2019m not her mom and that she\u2019ll always end up doing what her mom wants when she\u2019s here. Between Anne\u2019s parents, her mom has always been the more financially stable one and has compensated for her absence by using money and until recently, my partner was unable to afford a lot of things so Anne would often tell him that she\u2019ll only visit when he\u2019s been paid and that\u2019s why I stepped in with the love and affection and all of that, hoping to show her that money isn\u2019t everything but my partner emotionally checked out a few years ago and also just tries to compensate with money now.", "created_utc": 1691148145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hxee5/wibta_for_not_maintaining_my_relationship_with_my/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Intermittent reinforcement is one of the most powerful motivators, and also the most neurotic, anxiety producing tack. \n\nIt\u2019s very sad, for everyone but especially Anne, who is clearly desperate for her mom\u2019s presence, love, approval & acceptance - which seem pretty conditional on her perpetuating her mom\u2019s jealousy & insecurities as an extension of her mom. \n\nThe one silver lining here is time. \n\nBe steady & solid - don\u2019t leap ahead into \u201cbest parent\u201d Olympics nor fall back into spectator - just be warm, consistent & solidly trustworthy & ready with whatever amount of love Anne feels safe accepting because know that your love comes with a cost to Anne, set & levied by her mom \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude25\n\nDon\u2019t be a part of that \u201ccost\u201d structure.

Pulling back in the measured way you describe seems totally reasonable. \n\nOne thing I think after reading people\u2019s comments is that rather than just talking to Anne about how your feelings were hurt, which you say you\u2019ve done multiple times in the past, maybe you need to just tell her you think maybe it will be less challenging for her if you pull back on primary parenting a bit, at least until Anne seems more comfortable navigating this terrain, so that\u2019s what you\u2019ll be doing so she knows and understands what\u2019s happening. And also ask if she wants you to ask her Grandma and her parents to discuss the possibility of Anne living with her mom now. Before everyone freaks out, I\u2019m not suggesting OP kick Anne out of her life, but people are noting that she might be torn about how to navigate everything which is probably true. I\u2019m only noting that maybe she\u2019s worried about bringing this up so it\u2019s something OP might want to just ask her about. Since I don\u2019t want her to think OP is trying to get rid of her, I think OP should ask her about it first, so her mom doesn\u2019t get the chance to twist it around and tell Anne OP is trying to kick her out of her dad/OP\u2019s life. If Anne takes stock and realizes that she does want to continue with OP, Dad and Grandma, then I would def leave these big moments (and their financial expenditures) to Dad and Grandma.

They may be zero interest and short term, but you\u2019re allowed to have boundaries too, not just Anne.\n\nEdit: weirdly (or not since AITA is dull of stepfamily posts), there was just a post about a stepson who doesn\u2019t want to celebrate his stepmom on Mothers Day. In typing that, I was noting that you can\u2019t mandate affection, but the stepson OP should be prepared to have the stepparent withdraw a bit. I suggested there that stepmom would probably have an easier time of it if she tried to equate stepson with a young brother in law. With kid in laws, you naturally have more emotional distance and it\u2019s easier to keep the parents in mind.

You should take care of yourself first, be kind to her, but keep boundaries in making sure that you don't overextend yourself to please someone that is going to abandon any and all plans to be with her flaky mom.\n\nI can't know the future, but neither can any of these people on here. Everyone saying that she will learn to love and respect you, can't guarantee that. How many stories have been on here where the step-parent gets snubbed in favor of the bio-parent on the wedding day despite paying for everything and being there for the child for 20+ years. How many stories are there of adopted children finding their \"real\" parents and abandoning their adoptive parents when they do. I don't know if this normal or happens often, but there is enough of a pattern in these stories and the little girl you described that it doesn't seem like a stretch to say it might happen. \n\nIt's a sad reality that this might happen, and there is no shame or anything wrong for protecting yourself. Again, all this to say, don't ignore her or anything, just  stop setting yourself on fire to keep her warm.", "This is good advice! It's a lesson that her actions has consequences and if she hurts people's feelings those consequences might effect her. She can't claim to be surprised if there is no more parties in the future. I think it's fair to tell the rules in advance!", "It's pretty clear the mother is self-conscious about her role in her daughter's life, and she manipulated the daughter into cancelling the party in order to prove to herself that her daughter loves her more than you...\n\nBut the reality is that the daughter doesn't trust her mother, so daughter will do whatever it takes to make her mother happy.\n\nDaughter trusts you and is comfortable saying no to you...  \n\nbut for your own sake you do need to figure out how to get your partner more involved, because it is your partner and bio-mother who are taking you for granted and abusing your generosity here.\n\nDaughter is caught in the middle and just doing her best to keep everyone happy with her...\n\nYour partner is the one who needs to step up and put the mother in her place, so your efforts don't get bulldozed like this in the future!", "The mother did this on purpose. She wanted to \"put you in your place\" and is using her daughter to do so. Your husband needs to \"check\" back in and start actually parenting. Once her mom leaves again just be civil to Anne. Don't go out of your way to talk/care for her. I'm not saying neglect or ignore. Treat her like a cat. Show that you are open but let her make the first moves. Maybe that will help her realize just how much you actually do and care for her.", "I also agree with this. \n\nShe is a child and deserves love and support but OP has gone above and beyond. It's not OP's responsibility to overcompensate for the mother and father's relationship to their daughter. I think it's wonderful she has a relationship with Anne and should continue to have one but she is perfectly reasonable to want to step back and reevaluate how much effort she should be putting in.", "Treat your stepdaughter right, but remember that her father is the real parent. You are entitled to your feelings. But don't hold a grudge against your stepdaughter. It's not her fault she's dealing with feelings of abandonment, considering how her mother is behaving.", "This, OP. Her bio mom sucks and I\u2019m sure on some level she might even realize that it\u2019s not someone she can count on, but coming to terms with the realization that your parent isn\u2019t who you need and want them to be is hard even for adults. Just look at every other thread here and how often grown ass adults struggle finally cutting their parents off or accepting that they\u2019ll never be supported by them, no matter how abusive or horrible they act towards them. It\u2019s a child who\u2019s still clinging to hope that her mother will be there for her."]}
