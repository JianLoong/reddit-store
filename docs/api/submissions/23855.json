It was her birthday last week and I spent the past few months planning everything for the day, as well as her actual party, which is next week. On the day, I organised balloons and cake for her classmates and friends and had everything delivered at school, including her first gift. I wished her a happy birthday and told her I loved her and she replied with an okay, which I felt was strange. I didn't get a thank you for anything, either. Later on that day, I found out that her mom had come home and surprised her with a dinner or something and effectively told everyone that the party I had planned was cancelled because she had made better plans for her daughter. I was a bit taken aback by this because my partner had been in constant communication with his bm and let her know what my plans were long before I started putting deposits down for the venues, games, activities, etc. I spoke to Anne to ask her what was going on and she told me that she was no longer interested in the party and wanted to spend time with her mom. I told her that her mom was more than welcome to attend the party next week and I would stay home but she turned that suggestion down as well and she hasn't replied to any of my messages or calls since then. I'm feeling a bit upset by this as I've lost thousands in deposits but mostly, I put a lot of work and effort into the planning, only to be snubbed at the last minute. Her dad works unusual hours so I do 90% of everything for her from PTA meetings, fundraisers, homework, pickups and drop-offs, doctors visits, etc and I do this because I love her but idk if I can keep taking this because it happens every time her mom visits, then when she leaves, Anne starts talking to me again. I understand that she's a child and misses her mother dearly and that's why I even pay for her flight tickets to visit her as well as resources for international calls but I'm also human.

My partner and I have had multiple conversations with Anne in the past about respecting our efforts and allllll of that and during our latest conversation, she told me that I need to remember that I\u2019m not her mom and that she\u2019ll always end up doing what her mom wants when she\u2019s here. Between Anne\u2019s parents, her mom has always been the more financially stable one and has compensated for her absence by using money and until recently, my partner was unable to afford a lot of things so Anne would often tell him that she\u2019ll only visit when he\u2019s been paid and that\u2019s why I stepped in with the love and affection and all of that, hoping to show her that money isn\u2019t everything but my partner emotionally checked out a few years ago and also just tries to compensate with money now.", "created_utc": 1691148145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hxee5/wibta_for_not_maintaining_my_relationship_with_my/", "score": 1023, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Pulling back in the measured way you describe seems totally reasonable. \n\nOne thing I think after reading people\u2019s comments is that rather than just talking to Anne about how your feelings were hurt, which you say you\u2019ve done multiple times in the past, maybe you need to just tell her you think maybe it will be less challenging for her if you pull back on primary parenting a bit, at least until Anne seems more comfortable navigating this terrain, so that\u2019s what you\u2019ll be doing so she knows and understands what\u2019s happening. And also ask if she wants you to ask her Grandma and her parents to discuss the possibility of Anne living with her mom now.

Since I don\u2019t want her to think OP is trying to get rid of her, I think OP should ask her about it first, so her mom doesn\u2019t get the chance to twist it around and tell Anne OP is trying to kick her out of her dad/OP\u2019s life. If Anne takes stock and realizes that she does want to continue with OP, Dad and Grandma, then I would def leave these big moments (and their financial expenditures) to Dad and Grandma.

In typing that, I was noting that you can\u2019t mandate affection, but the stepson OP should be prepared to have the stepparent withdraw a bit. I suggested there that stepmom would probably have an easier time of it if she tried to equate stepson with a young brother in law. With kid in laws, you naturally have more emotional distance and it\u2019s easier to keep the parents in mind.

How many stories are there of adopted children finding their \"real\" parents and abandoning their adoptive parents when they do. I don't know if this normal or happens often, but there is enough of a pattern in these stories and the little girl you described that it doesn't seem like a stretch to say it might happen. \n\nIt's a sad reality that this might happen, and there is no shame or anything wrong for protecting yourself.

She wanted to \"put you in your place\" and is using her daughter to do so. Your husband needs to \"check\" back in and start actually parenting. Once her mom leaves again just be civil to Anne.

Just look at every other thread here and how often grown ass adults struggle finally cutting their parents off or accepting that they\u2019ll never be supported by them, no matter how abusive or horrible they act towards them.

If Anne wants to miss her own party, well, I'm sure her friends will fill her in later.\n\nI agree that you're the most reliable adult in her life (apart from grandma), but this isn't a competition. You can have lots of people love you; and return that love equally, yet unique to each relationship.\n\nI could get past the ignoring you because mum's home act, but blowing off a party she ASKED FOR and PLANNED is that step too far for me.

That\u2019s understandable; but try and imagine how hurtful and confusing it is for Anne to go along with whatever her mother wants only to have her leave again.  It\u2019s going to take her a long time to realize how little her mother actually cares for her.\n\nThink about it.  Her mother is selfish.  She knew that Anne was excited for the party, she just didn\u2019t want you to be the one to make her happy.  She knew that Anne would cancel the party if she told her to.

Another comment says kids often lash out at people they feel safe with and I can't emphasize that enough. She probably doesn't realize it herself.\n\nDon't try to buy your way into her heart because at least one of her parents is doing that. Show her, don't tell her, you're always there for her and on her side whether she's right or wrong. Being a physical presence, and steadying influence, in her life will do her more good than expensive shoes or a new iPhone every year. This is especially important when she acts out makes mistakes, or is in the wrong.

With my daughter (6 y/o) we tell her we love her even when we're frustrated with her and when she's mad at us. Daniel Tiger has a great song \"You can be mad at someone you love; When you are ready, give them a hug\". One fight or hurt is rarely awful enough to destroy love.

You're in a tough spot, but please don't withhold affection from Anne because of this.\n\nI am a grandparent, and my partner and I have been raising a grandson.  For many years, his mother (my daughter in law) lived with us, but she ignored him.  We went through time after time where we had provided everything he needed.

And, on those few rare occasions where she was present, all his attention was on her.  Of course it hurt - but we also had to remember the hurt of a young boy who just wanted some attention from his mom so that he could be assured that she did love him.  She finally moved out just before the pandemic, and he's pretty clear how much he dislikes her now.\n\nAnne may not understand how much pain she caused you over this, but she will down the road.  Just keep being the presence that she needs. It's a hard, hard thing to do, but this child needs you to do that.\n\nEditing to add - make sure you take care of yourself.

Her emotional well being should come first. \n\nHowever, I think this needs to be a heart to heart discussion with her. You need to ask her if she feels she is betraying her mom by accepting you as another motherly figure in her life. You need to explain that you don't wish to make her choose between you, but need to know how to make her feel safe telling you exactly where she is at or what she wants. You then need to not react but respond to what she shared with you. Explain that you do feel sad, and frustrated that money and time was spent for no reason but that is not on her, her dad and mom also play a role in how it turned out. \n\nYou don't have to be the mom, but you are still a role model. There is no such thing as a child being loved too much, but they should never have to choose between loyalties. If her mom is the instigator of cancelling the party, tell the daughter that is something you will have to discuss with her dad and birth mom. It should not be up to her to have to navigate this alone. \n\nShe likely withdraws because she doesn't know what to do, or how to properly handle it. Her birth mom and grandmother probably say all kinds of messed up things to guilt her into making choices that seem like they shun you. Be the safe place she can come to ask if you really are trying to replace her mom or such. Her emotions are real and valid and at the end of the day when Mom is once again in the distance she will turn to you. \n\nIf you decide to just stop caring and disengage with her the relationship will never be a good one. There will be no bonding. \n\nShe is 11, will be going through way more identity issues, finding herself and navigating choices that will help her become an adult that is well adjusted. \n\nYou absolutely have the right to wash your hands of it if you wish to. If you need to because you realize you are not equipped to deal with the dynamic. \n\nHowever it's kind of crappy to be the parent until they don't do what you would wish them to do.

Children are keen observers, but terrible interpreters.  They see *everything*, far more than we might imagine, but often are unable to properly understand what they\u2019re seeing.  That means we as parents need to be that much more mindful of how children may interpret our actions, and either explain to them what they are seeing in a way they can comprehend, or adjust our behavior so that our intentions are clear.  \n\nIn this case, if you pull back from Anne in response to this incident and stop doing things you used to do, she\u2019s not going to interpret it as \u201cOP still loves me, she\u2019s just having a hard time managing her own complicated emotions so she\u2019s taking a step back for a bit to lick her wounds.\u201d  Instead she\u2019s going to interpret it as her own emotional level, which tends to be very self-focused at that age.  She is more likely to interpret it as \u201cOP hates me.  It\u2019s not my fault my mom made different plans at the same time as OP\u2019s party.  And it\u2019s not like I had a choice - it\u2019s my mom, I had to go.  And now she is being mean and over something that wasn\u2019t my fault.  I can\u2019t trust her for anything anymore.\u201d\n\nThe problem for you is that you probably can\u2019t explain what you want to do in a way she can understand at this age.  All you can do is act in a way that beat communicates your intentions.  Sometimes as parents we have to take it on the chin a bit because that\u2019s what our children need.  It may be that you are not able to do that at this age/stage in life, and that not an indictment of you.  Coming into a step-parent situation for an older child can be really hard if you haven\u2019t already had the experience of raising a child to that age/stage from birth because you haven\u2019t had the opportunity to learn and grow as they develop (because little kids, little problems; big kids, big problems).  If you are not ready for that role right now, that doesn\u2019t make you a bad person but you do need to be honest about it because you can do a lot of damage if you aren\u2019t honest.", "Your partner kind of sucks for not being more active in the child's life, and i hope he eventually realizes that he needs to be present.", "She's an 11 year old child with a manipulative mother that abandoned her pretty much and a neglectful father, not an abusive menace.

When you get on a rollercoaster, the safety harness comes down. The first thing you do is pull really hard on that harness and shake it about to check it will hold you and keep you safe. Kids do the same thing - they push you away and treat you terribly because they are checking that you will still be there and keep them safe. The more reliably you support them, despite the behaviour, the less frequently they will test you as they grow up. Then they will look back at their childhood and see you as the secure safe person, not mum.

My mom and I had a very difficult relationship when I was growing up and this was one of the reasons why. She probably should be in therapy if she isn\u2019t already to deal with all of this, especially at her age when her mind and  body are starting to change.

I could mostly just go hide in my room. Sounds bad, but my parents took care of it and it was just the stress of it that had me hide, my parents were great to me too. Maybe reading about childhood issues with parents might help. My parents always got reading material and as my husband says I'll read anything with words, so even from a early age I knew what was going on, even if when I was young I didn't REALLY understand, it started with \"kid hurts inside, kid gets comfy, trusts adults, acts out\" and like any kid pushes boundaries and rules to make sure they are still there, the caretakers still care, etc. Only obviously foster kids had a lot more confusion and anger and acting out than happy family kids (who still tend to push to see what happens). As I got older I understood more of the whole process bit by bit.\n\nIt may sound bad but to be clear I don't wish it any other way. It was hectic and chaotic (I literally never knew if we'd have a kid that day or if they were going home, I'd know about court dates and that a kid might go home to, I wasn't kept in the dark). But so many different kids (52) and half my childhood in a big city so much culture, because my parents would get them at least some food or things that were important to them so of course I got to try the food and see things. \n\nI found Pocky at a store once.

There is an important lesson you need to learn at your age that you can't treat people poorly and expect them keep giving to you and supporting you the same as they did before. What you expect out of the people in your life MUST be reflected in the way you treat and regard those same people.\n\nSo let's look at what this means when it comes to a friend for example. Imagine you have a friend who gets really awesome packed lunches. They get all of these snacks that you're a fan of and because they have more than they need to feel full they start giving you a snack everyday at lunch. They didn't have to do this for you. You weren't starving. But for months they gave you something out of their lunch because they're your friend, they care, and they feel happy when they see how happy you get from that gesture. Then they realize that you stopped saying thank you a long time ago and came to expect that the snack would be given regardless, even though they never HAD to do this for you. One day they ask before giving you the next snack if you could do something like say thank you going forward again if they're going to keep giving you a snack. Instead of accepting that you could stand to show them a bit of gratitude out of being a good friend who was doing this to make you happy, you snap at them and tell them *'Whatever I can just go and get these snacks myself if you're not going to give them to me.'* And things shift between you and your friend after that because it becomes bigger than you taking the snacks for granted, your friendship with them is effected now because they feel unappreciated.\n\nThat is a small version of how things between us have felt lately. But we can work on this if you can help explain what you actually expect out of me. It would help both of us a lot if we could resolve some contradictions in your expectations of me. For example, after what happened with your birthday party this year - do you expect me to be prepared to do the same for you next year even if the outcome may be the same? Do you expect me to be prepared to do the same for you next year if you simply promise that you won't drop everything if your mother decides she'd rather do something else on your birthday? Did you make these decisions around your birthday party this year with the idea that you could simply get the same next year or did you make this decision with the understanding that you might not get the same again as a natural consequence of your choices? Would you feel it is unfair to you if I refused to do the same for you next year, essentially letting you stage the party you actually want on my money? Now why would you feel that is unfair when you were the one who expressed that I shouldn't be acting in a supporting family role towards you in the first place?\n\nHere lies the disconnect of your own expectations, and having to confront the outcomes of the choices you are making here. This is why I haven't fully accepted the choice you've expressed to disregard me as non-family, because I don't think you fully understand the **outcomes** of the decisions you're making here. If you choose to stand by the belief that because I am not family to you it does not matter how little regard you have for me, then you have to stand by all of the outcomes of that choice too. Which means the withdrawal of my support and provision. If you really mean it when you say it would make you happier if I stopped trying in this capacity, then you have to accept that the rest of your expectations have to fall in line with that. Love can't be bought. I'm not telling you to pretend to have any relationship with me that you don't want to have in order to keep getting the things that you want. **I'm telling you that you need to be honest with yourself and me.** If you have no room in your heart for me, and you'd rather picture a life without me being so involved in it, then you need to speak your truth and **you need to accept the outcomes of that truth**. If this isn't how you actually feel, then you need to accept the way that you're treating me has been hurting me and our potential for a great relationship and that needs to change going forward. Which grants the outcome of my continued support. **The one thing you can't do here is to choose to treat me like I'm not family and that my feelings don't matter while also expecting me to continue giving and doing what it takes to make you happy.**\n\n**The way that you treat people is a reflection of the expectations you have of them**. If you expect me to give and provide, then the way you treat me has to reflect that. I am here for you not because anybody else expects me to be, but because I can see that despite how you've behaved towards me that you are a good kid who deserves so much love and care. How you receive and regard this is entirely your choice, I can't make you feel one way or another I can only help you understand the choices that you are making better.\"", "The person you responded to is totally wrong; the issue is that her father is not stepping up to deal with this.

The unfortunate thing is that, whiles yes you're hurt, in the long run Anne will be hurt more.  Eventually she'll realize just how little her mom really cares, and that will break her apart.  Be ready to be there for that.  I understand wanting to take a step back, but maybe do that financially, but not emotionally.  Still be present, caring, and supportive, but put your foot down on money spent.  You also need to have a talk with your husband about checking back in, as well as how dangerous it is to throw money at the situation instead of connection, affection, and support.

Be good and kind to your husband, and cordial to Anne. You are not her parent. Stop trying to be. Just love in the same space when she decides to be there. Her mother can pay for everything else.

They gave and gave and gave and still I would hit them with \"you're not even my real family\".

I remember one night I was suppose to finally get to see him, he was going to pick me up and take me to a movie. But instead he got drunk and never showed up. I fell asleep on the front porch waiting for him and my actual dad carried me inside and put me in bed. The couple times I had hope I treated them so coldly but they never gave up on me and that made a big difference.\n\nLook how I refer to them now.
