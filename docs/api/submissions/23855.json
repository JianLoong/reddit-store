It was her birthday last week and I spent the past few months planning everything for the day, as well as her actual party, which is next week. On the day, I organised balloons and cake for her classmates and friends and had everything delivered at school, including her first gift. I wished her a happy birthday and told her I loved her and she replied with an okay, which I felt was strange. I didn't get a thank you for anything, either. Later on that day, I found out that her mom had come home and surprised her with a dinner or something and effectively told everyone that the party I had planned was cancelled because she had made better plans for her daughter. I was a bit taken aback by this because my partner had been in constant communication with his bm and let her know what my plans were long before I started putting deposits down for the venues, games, activities, etc. I spoke to Anne to ask her what was going on and she told me that she was no longer interested in the party and wanted to spend time with her mom. I told her that her mom was more than welcome to attend the party next week and I would stay home but she turned that suggestion down as well and she hasn't replied to any of my messages or calls since then. I'm feeling a bit upset by this as I've lost thousands in deposits but mostly, I put a lot of work and effort into the planning, only to be snubbed at the last minute.
