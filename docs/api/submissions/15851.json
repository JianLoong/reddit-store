Perhaps waiting at the table would have been \"nicer\".   But getting up with everyone else so staff could prepare the table for the next patrons was a thoughtful gesture.

If you had actually left and went outside that would be one thing, but waiting while still in the restaurant with 2 kids in tow seems fine to me. \n\nMaybe she has separation anxiety?", "NTA. Turning tables is how servers make money. It was considerate of you to give up the table to allow them to turn it. And it's not like you left the restaurant. You were at the door.

She knew everyone was leaving.", "NTA.\nWife overreacted. Was she afraid she was going to get lost walking to the front door or something? Nobody \"left\" her. Seems petty.

I dont expect anyone to wait, but there have been times someone stays back to make sure I know where they're going if the situation is appropriate.", "NTA\n\nYou waited for her, which is considerate. You also were considerate of the restaurant staff, which is incredibly reasonable.", "This is beyond petty and I can't believe your wife even cares that much about something this small and unimportant. Was the front door hard to find? Did you promise her you'd wait at the table no matter what? Is she actually mad at you about something else and using this as the conduit for her anger about a different thing?", " NTA. But your wife is. That\u2019s diva behaviour, tell her to knock it off.", "NTA. You did everything right. Considering the wait staff and allowing them to clean the table was a good call. I might suggest in the future that, if your wife takes her cell phone to the bathroom with her, maybe just text her that you left the table and are waiting by the door, so as to avoid any confusion in the future. But other than that, I do feel like she may have been overreacting a bit.\n\nStill, this may be one of those \"bite the bullet\" arguments. It might be best to apologize for upsetting her and talk about ways to prevent that situation from happening in the future.", "NTA. That\u2019s a big table and you all were done - you let the restaurant get the table turned over, and you waited at the door.

Plus, unless she had a bout of food poisoning, I doubt she'd have taken more than a few minutes. It's not like he'd have been sitting there for 1/2 hour - that would hold up a table and the next party. 3-4 minutes isn't going to make much of a difference and the staff can bus with him there. I would've waited for my spouse vs standing at a door with my two kids, but I also wouldn't have made a big deal if my spouse and kids were already at the door.", "XD well, that's a first, having both OP and the other person involved respond to a comment. \n\nI think a more fair assessment would be NAH. The others may have interpreted you getting up to use the restroom as their cue to start heading out too (assuming their dessert was almost done when you left), since the cheque had been paid. Your husband had justifiable reasons for getting up as well. With the prior assessment of \"they probably didn't intend to be rude\", I wouldn't jump to \"that's a bit rude\" either. It's a logical assumption that you'd want to leave as well after using the restroom. \n\nThe only other point of clarification would be: was your husband in sight of the table? It's entirely possible you didn't notice as you were heading back to the table, because you weren't looking, but that's not really a reason to get mad about it.", "Why do you think it was rude? I genuinely don\u2019t understand the problem. They were eating, you went to washroom, they thought you started to pack so everyone else did too. Why are you fighting over this? What difference does it make where your husband waited for you? I genuinely fail to comprehend what made you feel \u201cembarrassed\u201d?", "you could also be mad at the others that they just left and he followed . They could have waited but didn't so don't blame your hubby for that and you couldn't see the door ? how big was the restaurant", "Fair enough. It is also unclear how long the wife was away for, so I don't imagine either option is any easier with kids", "Well, let her read the answers then, I guess. Definitely NTA. The marriage isn't gonna go great if you take out momentary embarrassments on each other like they are crimes. After she reads all the NTA responses, give her a kiss and forget this bullshit.", "I\u2019m probably going to continue to get downvoted, but I don\u2019t think what you did is rude at all. You didn\u2019t leave her purse or other belongings behind or anything, from your telling. If this was a kid, and not your adult partner, than yeah, it would be wrong. \n\nBut the *rude* thing would have been to continue occupying that table after everyone was done with their meal. Servers get paid on tips. Being able to squeeze in *one* more table before closing might be a significant difference in that server\u2019s pay at the end of the day. \n\nIf the restaurant was busy than you definitely should have cleared out, because that\u2019s the polite thing to do. If the restaurant *wasn\u2019t* busy, she should have had no problem seeing that you were waiting by the door for her. Still NTA.", "Yeah. NAH. \n\nI'd have waited or at least told her that you were going to head out to the car before she left the table but it's an issue that takes all of 5 seconds to figure out.", "Actually I chose you as sort of a blanket, since I saw a few others say the same nonsense thing, but yours happened to be the highest.\n\nAlso Im not insulting you as a person, Im criticizing what you (and others) did.\n\nAlso ironic that you feel insulted on a sub where posts, lets be honest, usually get alot of undeserved scathing attacks of character rather than some tough but fair constructive criticism.", "How far do you actually think the door is from their table?", "Unless we're driving all together the other people don't need to wait for her lol.", "I'm the same as the husband I would have got up. Because there are other people who want to eat there too. \n\nWhy not get up and wait at the door so other patrons can have a seat. Especially if it's a large party.  Because there's either another large party waiting or they have to break down the tables to fit smaller parties.  Sounds like he's just being respectful to the restaurant and staff", "Haha, glad to offer my perspective on it. It's a very big restaurant and I walked around the perimeter of the restaurant to find the table empty and they were all outside, I felt kind of embarrassed that they just left without me. \n\nTo be honest and at the expense of sounding even more petty, this happened over a month ago. At the time, I was a little annoyed but didn't even mention it at the time. Today, we were at our kid's appointment and both stopped to use the restroom and I got out after a couple of min, he wasn't there waiting for me so I assumed he left and went to the waiting room in a different part of the building, so I went there but he wasn't there, I texted him that I was there. When he got there, he said \"You didn't wait for me?!\" That comment sparked my anger and I brought up the restaurant incident. He claims he was joking, he might've been, but that comment brought out the inner fury in me lol.", "I agree with the wife that it\u2019s rude. In principle, I just think it\u2019s rude for a group of people to move while one person is momentarily away and unaware. Because the person comes back and thinks \u201cwhere the heck is everyone, did they leave without me?\u201d and may have to scramble, may have to fetch something at the first location that was forgotten, etc. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s pretty low key and well within the realm of \u201cnormal things people do sometimes that\u2019s maybe a little technically rude but doesn\u2019t require a reaction.\u201d  Definitely not worth getting angry or fighting over.", "This feels too civil for this sub. It's confusing. I feel like I should insult you or something.\n\nInstead we can be fairness buddies.", "OP\u2019s wife did chime in! The backstory is slightly interesting. At least, it reinforced my ESH take.", "The difference is that the posters offer themselves up to be judged ..also theres nothing constructive about calling someone rude and stupid", "No idea, depends on the size of the restaurant and where they were seated relative to the door.", "Did I say \"need?\"\n\n I did not.\n\nEven if they're all driving together, as long as they wait in or at the car it's *okay.*  Sometimes people want better than \"okay.\"", "It\u2019s worse if some of the group are just driving off without saying your goodbyes.", "Hahaha well how\u2026 interesting\u2026 that he left out that detail!", "Yeah; that\u2019s pretty critical information.", "Yeah he\u2019s a big AH then. This should be in the post.", "Okay I get it now but yeah not worthing fighting over for sure. You feel perplexed and then you are like \u201coh we are leaving\u201d and join the group. That\u2019s all it has to be.", "> Because the person comes back and thinks \u201cwhere the heck is everyone, did they leave without me?\u201d\n\nOr maybe \"huh they must be outside.\"\n\nLike, come on, if you come back from the bathroom *after dinner* and the table is empty and your first thought is \"I HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY MY LOVED ONES\" then the problem is not with said loved ones", "I'll give you a freebie.

Op responded everyone was waiting in the parking lot and saying their goodbyes there", ">  Op responded everyone was waiting in the parking lot and saying their goodbyes there\n\nI realize that but there was a time before they left the table where OP could have said they could wait. If you look back at my first comment, you'll see that it's just a more reasonable sentence than the only thing you could think of to have them wait.", "It didnt occur to me in the moment to try to get everyone to wait before people had started already heading away from the table and I wouldnt have tried to make everyone wait anyways, now knowing how she reacted to this I will be sure to wait myself.", "YTA\n\n\"No man left behind\" rule applies in group situations like this.", "Wild that you even still remember it a month later tbh", "Same for the comments you leave behind, it is an open forum after all. If you think he is ok doing something rude, then they should be fine receiving it as well.\n\nAlso I clearly said that what they did was rude and stupid, not them.

Did you leave any of her belongings at the table? \n\nAssuming there was no indication that people were ready to head out imminently, I feel like the options were:\n\nA) Tell everyone you\u2019re gonna hang out til your wife gets back (the group probably would\u2019ve hung out with you.)\n\nB) Gather up all of her stuff and join the rest of group outside.

On the other hand, waiting a minute or two for someone to come back is not going to make a significant difference with that.

However, you could have hung back to wait for your wife since she didn't even know the plan was to leave (personally I would wait by the restroom instead of by the table). Nobody was so horrible that I'd call them an asshole, but it was a bit of a miscommunication, and I always thing it's good to wait for the other person if they don't know where to find you.

I feel like women can only \"overreact\".", "She commented, she only \u201coverreacted\u201d a month later he got an attitude about her leaving the table when he was in the bathroom.", "You're on a sub that labels men as the worst very consistently. That just isn't true.", "??? You think op just got up and left his kids at the table?", "I'm sure you don't allow your husband to DO anything unless he thinks of you first.", "And just out of curiosity, do you and your wife not communicate in these situations. If everyone was getting ready to leave how hard was it for you to say to your wife when she was leaving the table, \"I'll meet you out front\" or \"I'll wait till you get back\".\n\nWhenever we go out with friends or family and someone leaves the toilet in your situation, we usually all wait and leave together or say we will meet them outside. You and your family essentially abandoned your wife at the restaurant as soon as she left the table.\n\nI'll say NAH  and give you the benefit of the doubt and being a clueless sheep and following the group, but you owe your wife an apology, and you both need to learn to communicate better.", "Wow OP is definitely a big asshole then. Why does he think she has to wait for him but he doesn't have to wait for her?", "That's highly untrue of this sub", "Should they have all clapped when she got back to the table too?", "They said want, not allow", "I did apologize and will be better next time", "Apparently they do, and then do a happy dance because the woman managed to go to the bathroom by herself."]}
