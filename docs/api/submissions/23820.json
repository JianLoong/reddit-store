{"id": 23820, "submission_id": "15hgx5u", "title": "AITA for being \"rude\" to my aunt?", "selftext": "I(M18) am bisexual. I've known this since I was 12, and am very open/proud about my identity. Although being bi, I tend to date women typically. I find dating men to be different then dating women, and I have preferred dating women. I have hooked up with other guys, and dated a few(very briefly).\n\nA little background. A week ago, my sister had her sweet 16. The entire family came, close and extended. I brought my girlfriend(F 19), who I've been dating for 5 months. Despite the relatively short time, she's become one of the family. My mom, dad, siblings, grandparents, and everyone else loves her.\n\nMy dad's sister is somewhat estranged from the rest of us. As a teenager, she was a reckless drunk, who managed to get kicked out every month. In her early adult life, she changed and was apart of the family again(distantly). She was always rude, however. She would act nice around my grandparents, but around my dad and his other siblings, she would be a mega bitch. We only saw her at parties my grandparents threw, rarely outside of those.\n\nFor my sister's sweet sixteen, my grandparents offered to cover it. Both pairs are well off with money, and split the cost 50/50(we later found out this was because my parents purchased my sister a car). But, because my dad's parents were paying for it, my aunt got invited. When we saw she RSVP'd, we weren't thrilled, but decided to just ignore her for the party.\n\nOkay, now onto why I'm posting. About 2 hours into the party, my aunt showed up VERY late. We had the venue for 5 hours (6-11) and she showed up around 8:30. Off the bat, she started complaining to my dad about starting without her(again, we would've had to delay over 2 hours). She walked over to where me, my girlfriend, and my sister were sitting. She asked us how we were, then said:\n\n\"Damn, I thought you were bisexual. Why have I never seen a boyfriend?\"\n\nImmediately, my table, my parents' table, and other surrounding tables went silent. You could see the rage on my sister's face, and my girlfriend's(I warned her about how bitchy and rude my aunt was.) I took a lot of offense to this, and quickly shot back:\n\n\"Damn, you're in your late 30's and straight, why haven't I ever seen a boyfriend?\"\n\nMy aunt looked like I had just shot her, and instantly started crying. She screamed a string of expletives, and ran out. I don't know where she was going, since she ubered here and was going to get one back to her apartment.\n\nThe next day, I got calls from my grandparents, saying what I said was \"rude and uncalled for\", knowing her struggles in finding a partner. I told them that it was perfectly called for, and her struggles in dating aren't my fault. She texted me a long paragraph, essentially calling me an asshole and that she was just asking a question. Now, some of my family members are saying what I did was rude, \"knowing how she is, I should expect it\". I can't help but wonder if I did cross a line.
