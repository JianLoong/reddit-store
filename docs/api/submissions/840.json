In life we don't always win and part of life is learning how to deal with losing.  You learn what you are good at and what your gifts are.

He is going to grow up with a warped view of life.  \n\nBeat his ass and teach him.", "NTA he's got to learn some time that the world won't \"let\" him win everything. He needs to learn about showing good sportsmanship whether he wins or loses. Because otherwise, I promise he won't have many friends. No one likes the kid that throws a fit when he doesn't win, and goats when he does. I'd say stop pulling your punches. Never let him win again. If he wins by his own merit, great!

Your brother needs to learn how to lose & lose gracefully, because life itself is not going to pander to his bent feelings every time something goes wrong.

I had to do the same with my little sister. If I didn't lose, I would get punished. Well, I did like you. One day I started winning.

If they can't win fairly, you should let then win some of the time. By 11, they should know that sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. As he gets older, letting him win should make him upset too.

It's not a good situation if your brother thinks anyone who beats him must have cheated. Do you parents ever reprimand him for mocking you? I'd be inclined to just stop playing games with him at all. Go on strike! Surely your brother has his own friends he can play with. NTA and I'm sorry your parents are such jerks.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let him win anything.

He's now much older than you were when you started letting him win.\n\nThere are a vouple things you could do that might help. The first is to \"spot\" him a few pieces, do that the game is harder for you than for him. That way you can play your best and he still has a chance to \"win\".\n\nAnother is to find different games. Games with actual chance involved can be more fun, especially when skill levels are very different. Or find a game for 3 players and badger your father to play it with the two of you, and see how he likes being the bad guy if he wins. (Or better yet, team up with your brother to crush him.)", "NTA.  You should tell your family how you feel.  At 11 yo your bro needs to learn the facts of life, like he won't always win!  By making you let bro win every time, your parents are setting up your brother for a long series of disappointments.\n\nMy son was really good at checkers and chess really young, but he also had a temper.  At about 4 yo I started telling family to NOT LET HIM WIN.  Every one said I was terrible to do this to my son.  But I saw a 4 yo throwing a checkerboard across the room and screaming when he lost, and that was simply not acceptable.  If he couldn't learn to be a good sport at 4, when would he?\n\nSo, we all played fairly with him and you know what? He doubled-down and got better and better.  He is still a super competitive person now, in a good way.  But he was a holy terror at 4 yo.  I don't regret my actions one bit.\n\nPlus, you don't deserve to be frustrated like that.

He never let me win.  It probably took about a decade but I became an exceptional chess player and finally beat him a few times.  Him not letting me win let me learn how to lose.  AND I became excellent at chess because I had to constantly learn and up my game.  That game really is about critical thinking and concentration.\n\nTo this day, no one can beat me at chess.  I'm obviously not a pro or anything.\n\nUnless you are playing Candyland with a toddler it really doesn't help to let someone win at a game when you are simply better than them.  Especially if then your brother makes fun of you about it after the fact.\n\nIt can just be your life rule:  I'm not letting someone win.  If they want to play with me that's the rule.  \n\nMy Dad passed about 20 years ago and I really miss playing chess with him!\\~", "NTA. Playing games with his sister is a privilege for your brother.
