{"id": 3095, "submission_id": "z37khg", "title": "AITA for saying my boyfriend\u2019s roommate can\u2019t come to Thanksgiving Dinner?", "selftext": "Me (26F) and my boyfriend (34M) have been dating for nearly a year and a half now. Tomorrow, he\u2019s coming to Thanksgiving dinner at my dad\u2019s house and meeting my family for the first time. I\u2019m extremely family oriented and it\u2019s so important to me that he\u2019s finally meeting them. This also means the world to my family because I rarely bring men home and they\u2019ve been wanting to meet him for a long time. He\u2019s aware of this and how much this meeting means to me and has assured me that he\u2019s looking forward to it too. \n\nThis afternoon, he asked if his roommate could come too. I was caught off guard and said no. I didn\u2019t even ask my family who I\u2019m sure would say yes, but it\u2019s a hard boundary for me. I barely know his roommate but he\u2019s military and will not be able to be with his own family for the holiday, which is why my boyfriend asked. I understand and appreciate his compassion and kindness but I need this event to be just him, me, and my family without his buddy who is a stranger to me. I called him to talk through it, but he\u2019s extremely upset and wasn\u2019t really responding. I asked if he\u2019s still coming and he said yes. Then, I asked if he\u2019s okay and he said no but that he will be. I told him to reach out to me when he\u2019s ready and that I understand if he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me right now so I haven\u2019t heard from him since the phone call a couple hours ago. I feel like a massive asshole but this is one of the rare events where I\u2019ve put my foot down in this relationship and refused to accommodate his wants. So, AITA?\n\nUpdates:\n\nFor more clarity and because people are making a lot of unfounded assumptions, I have briefly met his roommate (ie \u201chi, bye\u201d) on multiple occasions. We barely know each other, though, because he has a schedule that makes it so he\u2019s rarely around when I am and we\u2019ve never had the opportunity to have a full conversation surpassing basic greetings. I made it very clear that I\u2019d love to have him and include him in my family but the first meeting between my parents and boyfriend wasn\u2019t the place to do so.\n\nMy boyfriend has not met my family because I\u2019m very particular about who I bring home and will not bring someone home unless I am 100% comfortable that that is the correct choice. I\u2019m protective of my family and don\u2019t want them to get attached. I get it\u2019s unconventional but it\u2019s my choice and every party involved respects that.\n\nI ended up apologizing to my boyfriend, asking my parents, and inviting his roommate (who wasn\u2019t aware my bf had asked about him coming). He can\u2019t even come anyways. I appreciate the comments, even the ones calling me a heartless monster, but no one is put out in the end.", "created_utc": 1669256015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z37khg/aita_for_saying_my_boyfriends_roommate_cant_come/", "score": 9118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s very possible that your boyfriend found out his roommate has nowhere to go on Thanksgiving and wants to extend the invitation to join you according to custom.

You\u2019re NTA for that. But your boyfriend is also NTA for being deeply disappointed that you\u2019re unwilling to budge on this.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the bond of those who serve together. It runs deep \u2014 especially if they\u2019ve seen combat together. Not every military spouse or significant other has to go \u201call in,\u201d but I\u2019d caution you to think about how you\u2019ll handle certain aspects of military life as a team \u2014 especially if things continue to progress.\n\nGood luck.\n\n(Note: I actually met my husband because of the \u201cleave no battle buddy behind\u201d mentality. His company had recently returned from a deployment, and a friend from college had a date with his roommate. At the last minute, his roommate found out he had no plans and refused to go on the date unless my friend found a date for him. One phone call later, enter me.

Tomorrow, he\u2019s coming to Thanksgiving dinner at my dad\u2019s house and meeting my family for the first time. I\u2019m extremely family oriented and it\u2019s so important to me that he\u2019s finally meeting them. This also means the world to my family because I rarely bring men home and they\u2019ve been wanting to meet him for a long time. He\u2019s aware of this and how much this meeting means to me and has assured me that he\u2019s looking forward to it too. \n\nThis afternoon, he asked if his roommate could come too. I was caught off guard and said no. I didn\u2019t even ask my family who I\u2019m sure would say yes, but it\u2019s a hard boundary for me. I barely know his roommate but he\u2019s military and will not be able to be with his own family for the holiday, which is why my boyfriend asked. I understand and appreciate his compassion and kindness but I need this event to be just him, me, and my family without his buddy who is a stranger to me. I called him to talk through it, but he\u2019s extremely upset and wasn\u2019t really responding. I asked if he\u2019s still coming and he said yes. Then, I asked if he\u2019s okay and he said no but that he will be. I told him to reach out to me when he\u2019s ready and that I understand if he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me right now so I haven\u2019t heard from him since the phone call a couple hours ago.

The fact that OP even admits that's her family would have welcomed the roommate makes it even worse.

I'll get to hear about what everyone is grateful for, not exactly an original tradition, but not one that we practiced in my family of origin. I can see the argument for both sides, and I've experienced both ways, neither is necessarily wrong, but I know which holidays I prefer.

The one near me is doing a Ruck tomorrow and meal afterwards for anyone who doesn\u2019t have plans.", "You\u2019re entitled to do whatever you want, but I was raised that you wouldn\u2019t let someone be left alone for something like thanksgiving. Especially someone from the military that is unable to travel home. I\u2019ve invited many ppl home to my family\u2019s holiday meals. It wouldn\u2019t feel right to me or my family knowing they\u2019re all alone. \n\nAlso. This is clearly a huge deal for you and bf. And he knows that. Maybe he wants his friend there to help alleviate some of the pressure that he\u2019s feeling.", "INFO:  Does OP's family have military experience?  If so, They would probably insist the roommate came if they knew about him.", "YTA isn't Thanksgiving supposed to be about kindness and generosity and being grateful for what you have? If my partner was happy to let a friend be alone, when they're already away from their own family, it would honestly change the way I feel about them.\n\nI think you're putting too much importance on your bf meeting your family - yes it's a milestone in a relationship, but after the initial meet and greet is over, it's just dinner really. I wouldn't be able to enjoy it knowing my roommate was eating shitty food on their own, missing their family.", "YTA. You're focused on trying to get a perfect first impression and he's focused on trying to ensure his close friend (military brother from the comments I'm reading) isn't left to spend the holiday alone. To me it says a lot about both of your character, especially since you seem certain your parents would say yes to the roommate coming. If there was any holiday where this request would be reasonable, Thanksgiving is the one! \n\nI think this would reflect even better on him in the eyes of your parents, showing he is compassionate and caring. Even though he will \"be okay\" he's going to see you as unkind. I am writing all of this assuming you at least know that the roommate isn't a huge jerk or something though.", "YTA and I know this will be the minority opinion apparently. You obviously said that it wouldn't be a big deal to invite another person just that you didn't want to because this is your big moment. Obviously your boyfriend knows his roommate. What does it take to be kind to someone who doesn't have the ability to spend time with their family. It shows more about you that you are deliberately cutting someone out that you are indeed not obligated to invite but is an AH move.", "I\u2019d like to say NTA because I understand that you want this to be special, but it\u2019s thanksgiving. It\u2019s very much a family event, and this guy is going to be sitting at home alone. Are you obligated to invite him? No, of course not. But having him over would be the more kind, compassionate response. And I\u2019d guess your bf won\u2019t make a fuss tomorrow, but he\u2019s clearly upset with you and probably won\u2019t forget it.", "NTA, him waiting to the last minute to ask this was him being not only disrespectful to you, but to your parents the hosts. He is expecting you last minute to play messenger to your parents to ask permission to bring another stranger, cuz your boyfriend is a stranger, to their family event when you yourself are not comfortable with that stranger being there.\n\nIt's a problem that he is not only expecting you to jump when he says jump, but the fact that you are noting that you have noticed him trying to push your boundaries and get you to jump when he wants to. Given that so many people are bringing up his military service like it's irrelevant detail, it means he and his friend have the option of not being alone on Thanksgiving cuz they will be there with other servicemen. Him demanding entry to your parents' event is not only showing a fundamental lack of respect for your parents, but for you. If you are feeling something in your gut, listen to your gut. You shouldn't feel like an asshole because you want basic boundaries", "OMG  my heart is kinda breaking for this poor guy without a family to be with for Thanksgiving, and OP saying no. Holy crap. Thanksgiving is all about including the random orphan, and doing it with love. I\u2019m so sorry OP that you are being so selfish on a day where it is about inclusion of everyone and thanking the universe for our community. Love is not a finite thing.", "YTA!! You can not bring your bf roommate for Thanksgiving but he is NEVER going to forget that you left his roommate out and alone on Thanksgiving.", "YTA.  He has nowhere else to go and it sounds like your family will welcome him.  His presence will also take some of the pressure off your boyfriend.  Kind of a buffer?  Because meeting your parents/ family for the first time on Thanksgiving is a LOT of pressure.  Be a decent person and change your mind.", "If you are so family oriented, what haven\u2019t they met him after a year and a half?", "Tbh I\u2019m just shocked that you have gone about a year and a half without having him meet your family. I\u2019ll never understand why people wait so long but I\u2019m going with a soft YTA. Thanksgiving and Christmas are both holidays that are inclusive of everyone and I think that y\u2019all should have met on a non holiday occasion as there\u2019s also going to be holiday stress in play. And as a military kid I also will say I think your boyfriend has every right to be upset with you, however I\u2019m again so confused how you don\u2019t know boss roommate. Do y\u2019all like just not get together with friends or family ever? If I never knew my boyfriends best friends or family in over a year even I\u2019d be concerned. I think y\u2019all need to evaluate some things and get on the same page - like why did you wait so long to meet family, let alone friends? None of this makes any sense to me", "Thanksgiving where you express gratitude for all you have...and refuse to let someone that has nowhere else to go come along.\nGlad my house has always been that anyone can bring anyone.  Only rule is everyone helps clean up.", "YTA. I had to spend Christmas alone one year, and being alone for the holidays can be extremely depressing. You mentioned that you appreciate your boyfriend\u2019s compassion, but you don\u2019t seem to have any yourself.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend has no business inviting someone else to an event neither of you are hosting.", "If anything, your family would get to see your bf's compassionate side by having his roommate along. But your bf is seeing your less than compassionate side, although I do understand your reasoning.", "Is there logic to your choice? Sure. Does that make it the right or moral choice? No. You have the power to make someone's Thanksgiving less lonely in an incredibly easy way, which should be enough. On top of that, it's something that matters to your bf and costs you nothing. Not to mention, while you should invite anyone, this is a service person who may one day put their life on the line for you, and that does make it even worse.\n\nYou have no real reason to say no other than it ruins your perfect image of the day. YTA. Your bf is going to break up with you as well, because things like this will seep into his opinion of you (rightfully so).", "A lot of differences of opinions here but I'm going to say a very slight YTA. You've been dating your SO for over a year and a half and your family has never met him, nor have you met his roommate? His roommate is a stranger to you and your BF is a stranger to your family. This is the time to get to know everyone and it would be nice to extend the invite to someone who will be alone this holiday season. You know your family will be more than happy to have an extra person, so why not? Your family will be interested to get to know both. Now your bf is upset and in a way I don't blame him, but on the other hand he kinda put this on you last minute.", "YTA \n\nI would never leave someone alone on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter if it was within my power to allow them to come. It\u2019s a huge sign of compassion to me. If I were your boyfriend, this would be a deal breaker for me.", "YTA. I think you should reflect on what the holiday season means and how we should act towards each other during the season (and beyond). I can\u2019t think of a single reason why excluding your boyfriend\u2019s roommate is in the spirit of gratitude, kindness, and even family. \n\nAdd the fact that the roommate is an active duty military member with nowhere to go, my goodness you are a jerk.", "I think you're a selfish (fill in the blank) What the hell is the big deal? The guy's military. He has no place to go and you only care about yourself. You are the definition of selfish.", "YTA you\u2019re not going to have to worry about your boyfriend getting along with your family. You\u2019ve shown him who you are and that\u2019s enough for him to second guess your relationship. Are you really that self centered that you couldn\u2019t include his friend for the holiday? You come across as heartless. Do you think your boyfriend will be comfortable and enjoy the holiday knowing his friend is alone? It could have been a great bonding experience to share together but you didn\u2019t want to share.", "NAH.\n\nI dont think you\u2019re an asshole but i do think you should rethink this. I think your bf is being inconsiderate but it depends on why he waited until the day before to ask if it was okay to bring his roommate. Sure, maybe it was poor planning. But maybe a flight got cancelled, maybe it was a money issue, maybe something got messed up with his leave.\n\nI get wanting meeting the family to be special. I get not feeling comfortable inviting the roommate over for a holiday. If I had suggested bringing a guest for the holidays my mom would have acted like I was committing a cardinal sin. My father would have been all for it. My father is a former marine. My ideal holidays will one day be a found family gathering, not necessarily just a blood family one.\n\nI think that how you respond to this will determine if your relationship continues. It seems important for your boyfriend to be able to include his roommate- especially since they\u2019re far from home this holiday season. I also understand you want this meeting to be special. A good compromise might be to invite the roommate for thanksgiving, but organize a dinner with your parents and boyfriend this weekend if you can so they can have some more \u201cone on one\u201d time.\n\nThe time to have the \u201cI need more than one days notice to invite people to family gatherings\u201d is a conversation that can wait until after this one day, I think. I\u2019m sure if you were somewhere unfamiliar you\u2019d be grateful to have somewhere to go for a holiday meal.\n\nInvite the roommate, have a nice dinner with your family, and /then/ have a chat with your boyfriend about notice for family events. I think this event will have a large impact on your relationship one way or the other.", "Growing up in a military town and married a military guy,  I knew my mom made enough to feed an army and drug strays home for Thanksgiving for years.\n\nOP, I get the first family meet is super important,  but a 19-22 y/o who is away from family on an important holiday, it would be a kind gesture to include them but not required. \n\nNYA But it wouldn't kill you to show some empathy.", "My first thought was that your BF was imposing.\n\nAnd yes, but his roommate is in the service. We're supposed to do a little more than just thank them for their service. \n\nYTA. \n\nIf you had problems with the roommate, I could see your stance, but he seems pretty neutral and is someone in the service away from home.", "I Don\u2019t understand all the YTA. Yes, thanksgiving is about coming together and being a community. Yet at the same time its also about family, which can be small and private. You are allowed to chose who you want at your dinner. Also it\u2019s the first thanksgiving op is bringing her SO to, that\u2019s a big deal. Her SO asking to bring a plus 1 isn\u2019t ok, even if his heart is in a good place. Nobody knows him, let alone nobody knows his plus 1. NTA NTA NTA", "NTA. If someone told me they were going to meet their girlfriend\u2019s family for the first time, there is no way I\u2019d even think about tagging along. Yeah it\u2019s kinda shitty to spend thanksgiving alone, but it\u2019s a holiday. It happens every year. Get some yummy takeout and watch a movie or something, it isn\u2019t THAT big a deal. \nI think the boyfriend is actually kind of shitty for even asking to be honest. If he hasn\u2019t met the parents in a year and a half of dating, clearly it\u2019s a pretty big deal for him to be doing so. OP already said she doesn\u2019t usually bring men home so this meeting is an important event in her life. For the friend, it would be a nice afternoon eating with some strangers and thinking \u201cthis is a nice family\u201d, for OP, it\u2019s possibly one of the biggest events in her life. It\u2019s the people she cares about the most in her life finally meeting. The boyfriend should understand this and shouldn\u2019t be making her feel guilty about wanting this moment to be special and not wanting some stranger there.", "This seems so odd honestly and i can\u2019t wrap my head around people saying you\u2019re the asshole. You\u2019re not an asshole for not wanting a stranger glued to your boyfriends hip the first time he meets your family, at an event you\u2019re not even hosting nonetheless. And not to mention the extremely rude fact of asking the night before which is inconsiderate to both you and your family hosting who would need to make sure there\u2019s enough room/food, but apparently that\u2019s okay to your boyfriend as long as his friend can come with him.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - you don\u2019t have any personal connection to this roommate. Also, military guys are used to doing unconventional things on the holidays. I doubt he\u2019ll mind either way.", "NAH, But, he's 34, you're 26, and he seems to be a lot more worried about his roommate's plans for Thanksgiving than you and your family. You're asking AITA about this because your instincts are telling you something is wrong here. Listen to your instincts! Most of the shit choices I've made my life happened because I ignored my instincts and hoped for better. And I'm 48. Please, learn this lesson sooner than I did.", "Instead of a soft YTA, I'm going to go with a HARD YTA, and here's why: he may not get another Thanksgiving. Ever. \n\nA lot of people, and I work for DoD for the military, severely underestimate the requirements that many who enlist put out there when they sign up. If he has a chance to have something, even if it's with his roommate, which does NOT surprise me since they're both military, then personally, the odd one out, is you. I never served, but it was my friends who did that stuck their necks out for me and gave me the opportunities of a lifetime and changed my life for the better. If they wanted Thanksgiving dinner at my house and wanted to bring people I didn't know, the door is open, the turkey will be on the table and I'll be ready to hand them a plate. \n\nI think there's a reason why Veterans' Day is in the same month as Thanksgiving.", "NTA. OP set reasonable boundaries, and I wouldn't want to bring a stranger along with a newly introduced significant other to family. \n\nIf anything, you guys can all have a Thanksgiving lunch together, then go to dinner as boyfriend and girlfriend.", "NAH\n\nYou're allowed to have boundaries and under most circumstances I'd agree especially given the first time meetings involved. \n\nBut you're leaving someone along on a holiday about being with people. Harsh but your prerogative\n\nMaybe compromise, hang out with him and his friend early in the day or the next day, show him you care!", "OP, you are NTA. This is a ridiculous ask on your boyfriend\u2019s part. \n\nOr, possibly, you\u2019re a character in a hallmark movie about to find out over an unbelievably awkward Thanksgiving dinner that the love of your life isn\u2019t your boyfriend, it\u2019s his best friend. If you meet a scrappy kid whose rough exterior just hides a need to share all the love they have to give in the next few days, it\u2019s probably that.", "NTA it\u2019s your family you can say no, it would be uncomfortable for everyone to have a complete stranger at an event where everyone knows each other. Plus he would probably stay by your boyfriend and prevent your bf from being able to connect with your family", "NAH.  You have a right to say no when a guest asks to be a guest.  That said, I don\u2019t like what you did and would find that choice incompatible with dating a person.  Compassion and generosity would be my preference in a partner.", "NTA you\u2019re doing introductions for the first time. My family is the kind that brings every loose stranger into our home for thanksgiving but I can\u2019t imagine trying to manage the stress of fielding the introduction between family and and a new partner and on top of that being in charge of the extra guest you don\u2019t really know. Any other year it would be fine to have the roommate come but this isn\u2019t any other year. Also, I can promise you there are others on base who aren\u2019t going home that roomie could team up with to have their own thanksgiving together.", "NTA, it's unreasonable for him to ask for some dude you barely know to come to your family Thanksgiving. Personally, I won't even invite close friends to Thanksgiving because I feel like it's a family holiday.\n\nMy guess is that he already told the dude he could come assuming you would say yes, and now he's frustrated/embarrassed.", "NTA - Irrelevant that it\u2019s thanksgiving, it\u2019s really about your family meeting him for the first time, he needs to be alone and he\u2019s kinda dumb or selfish for not understanding this.", "NAH \n\nI honestly don't understand all the You're The AH. \n\n1) This is the first time BF will be meeting BF.

Do you not go to his house, like ever?", "This right here, and like the fact that the people who are on his side as a military member are only basing on the argument that you should bend to his wants or you will lose the relationship is an indicator of the problem.

However, I do understand the military bond so I\u2019m going with NAH.", "The military point is entirely irrelevant here. BF is meeting OP's family for the first time.

If OP wants, she could pick another day for the BF to meet her family so that Thanksgiving isn't such a high pressure situation, but it sounds like they've been planning this Thanksgiving for a while, and the boyfriend asked to bring a friend at the last minute, just a day before the event.

The only thing the boyfriend could do, within the bounds of good manners, would be to casually mention that the roommate would not have family to be with on Thanksgiving.  Not in a \"hinting for an invitation\" kind of way, but as part of another conversation.

She was acting kind of squirrelly, and as I pieced things together, I realized that when she was acting squirrelly, it usually meant she had a BF. \n\nI was pissed at her and it wound up be friendship-ending for three reasons: 1) There was no need for her to have lied to me; had she just told me that she was bringing the BF to meet the family and wanted it to just be the two of them with her family, I would have totally understood.  But she hadn't even introduced me to him, just told me stories about him that made him sound sketchy; 2) She lied to her mother and made me look flaky, and then she TOLD me she lied to her mother, but didn't tell me why; and 3) my mother had died two days prior to the previous Thanksgiving, and this kind of pulled the rug out from under me emotionally and left me with no plans and seemingly no support. \n\nSo with no plans, I wound up adopting a dog, who hung around for the next 18 years.", "I\u2019ve known family-oriented people who are protective of their family and wait until relationships get REALLY serious before introducing their partners to their family.

Mine would too. I wasn\u2019t talking about that. I was talking about OP\u2019s boyfriend bringing someone else along for the first time meeting OP\u2019s parents. You can agree or disagree with me there, but pointing out that your family would host someone is doing neither.", "Agreed. Op will be under stress herself. It\u2019s reasonable she would want to head off even more stress.", "I don\u2019t know man maybe it comes from not having anywhere to go for Thanksgiving and knowing what that feels like but like at this point they\u2019re both strangers to OP\u2019s family\u2026 Not all of the attention is going to be on her partner as it\u2019s an all family dinner it\u2019s not like this is just a one on one or whatever so I\u2019m sure uncle Fred or whoever can entertain the other stranger if they wanna have a what are your intentions with my daughter type talk. Like it\u2019s one dinner and one day out of the year again maybe it\u2019s because I know what it feels like but the more the merrier and it\u2019s not even that awkward because again there are a bunch of people there and OP even said her parents wouldn\u2019t feel weird about it but that she personally does which is extra fucked up to me. Also? How is this person supposed to be focused on making a good impression and doing all that shit when he\u2019s probably worried about someone he sees as a brother being depressed as fuck and alone", "Agreed she isn\u2019t being unreasonable about the first time meet.  However boyfriend/roommate are both military which anyone in the military will tell you makes them family.  No one says they can\u2019t go early and the roomie could meet a little later for dinner?  There are options if she is willing (because it sounds like the family wouldn\u2019t object, just her).  \n\nObviously it\u2019s her call but to not even consider advancing an invite to a man fighting for our country on the day we give thanks for it seems just so\u2026.wrong.", "Or he isn't seeing this as the big deal OP sees.

That\u2019s not such an odd thing. I get that OP wanted this event to be about just her bf meeting her family for the first time, but if bf is that upset about his roommate then she can\u2019t really expect him to be in a cheery holiday mood at Thanksgiving dinner.

I ask first if I\u2019m not hosting but to me Thanksgiving is all about sharing what you have. I mean, that\u2019s the goal; obvs not the reality practiced in it\u2019s conception. \n\nI understand that this day is important to OP and they don\u2019t want anything to \u2018derail\u2019, but my parents would be WAY more proud of me for bringing the roommate on that special day and recognizing that of allllllll the days in a year, this one is one of the tougher ones for someone to sit out alone. \n\nAlso - OP may not know roommate well, but her BF sure does. I get she deserves to be comfortable and have boundaries, but it seems to me the kinder choice would have to agree. And since this is AITA, I think I\u2019ll have to vote ESH. It\u2019s poop that BF asked at the last minute. It\u2019s poop that she said no without considering it much. It\u2019s poop that someone is gonna be alone on T-day.

And if he doesn't get along with her family, that will reflect badly on the boyfriend.\n\nMy family has always had an open door policy for holidays. Anyone we know who would be alone, is more than welcome. Until that guy......\n\nHe constantly shared his racist opinions, we're open minded and mixed races. He was very fat shaming, we're all sizes from underweight to obese. He's from a very narrow minded religious background. We're mostly atheist. It was horrible.", "Are you kidding? There's going to be all kinds of scrutiny on him as the boyfriend.  \n\nHaving the roommate there might actually dispel some of that, but only if she knew him well enough to know that he was good company.  But he's a stranger to her.", "It just seems so odd? He's never met her family but wants to invite some ther dude they don't know to thier house? I guess if it's a big neighborhood type of party, but if it's just family + op's boyfriend then it's wierd to try and shoe horn in another random guy who they never would have invited.", "I've had many thanksgivings alone and I completely disagree with what you're saying. The bf needs to prioritize his gf's feelings and his relationship here. This is a massive relationship milestone. Should the roommate have come to the first date, should he be there for the engagement, maybe eventually in the delivery room?\n\nEdit: alone*, not along", "I agree here, probably because I view Thanksgiving as a time that's for both family and friends and truly a time to be thankful for what you have and to share when you can. My family will always invite those who don't have somewhere to go, especially friends who couldn't make it home. Spirit of the holiday and honestly can't imagine feeling good about leaving a friend alone. I get OP has built this meeting up because it's the first but it would greatly disappoint me if my partner felt as she does.", "Old lady, here. If I were the boyfriend, I would break-up with her. If she is this selfish now, imagine their marriage-her way or the highway, with no compassion for anyone else. I would also make my apologies and skip the dinner and have pizza with my roommate. \n\nIf it were an ordinary day, I doubt that the roommate would mind spending it alone. Thanksgiving is a family day, it\u2019s a day that is meant to be shared. The roommate can\u2019t get to his family, but because having an extra at dinner ruins her plans of who should share that day, she is showing that she is very self-centered.", "If they're family then he should have introduced the roommate to the gf before inviting him to thanksgiving! Come on people this isn't that complicated.", "She said he's military so it's possible they were long distance", "That still doesn't make it a small ask, but that's all beside the point anyway. The boyfriend knows how important this introduction is to her and is trying to bring along an emotional support bro because he's getting cold feet at the last minute. He should show up for her without distraction at this big moment in their relationship.", "Everyone isn\u2019t \u201ca hive\u201d just because most people disagree with you.", "This right here, like I really want her to dig into this.", "I get that lots of families would do that, but I\u2019m talking about OP\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s thought process.", "My family would absolutely welcome the friend, especially if he was alone on Thxgiving. My mom feeds home repairmen and sends homemade rolls with our UPS driver around the holidays. We have a more-the-merrier mentality.", "If it were my daughter, I\u2019d be extremely disappointed she didn\u2019t ask and invite him. To knowingly leave someone alone on a holiday is not something I\u2019d be proud of. She even says her parents would definitely say yes. It\u2019s like she\u2019s worried the friend will steal the thunder or something.", "I can easily see myself in the position of the bfs roommate, and I would be absolutely mortified if my roommate wanted to take me along, not to his families thanksgiving but the thanksgiving of his gfs family who he has never met", "It's odd as heck and completely disregards OP's feelings", "It\u2019s not odd if you\u2019ve been in the military. I get why it\u2019s odd to civilians though. We frequently end up bringing a buddy along if we have family and that person doesn\u2019t, specially during special occasions like these. \nThat said, I get why she isn\u2019t comfortable. She doesn\u2019t know the guy.", "I\u2019d agree if it was a random family get together but it\u2019s Thanksgiving and as many people have pointed out being in the military and being alone on holidays can be pretty heavy. OPs bf feels for his friend so he\u2019s working through that and having to tell him he\u2019ll be alone. OP is not wrong for her feelings but she said herself her family would have said yes.\n\nIt\u2019s also not a random guy, it\u2019s his roommate. She doesn\u2019t have anything negative to say about him she just doesn\u2019t know him well which can be resolved by spending more time around him. She needs the day to only be about her relationship and family. Understandable enough, but guarantee bf isn\u2019t going to be as \u201cthankful\u201d as she\u2019d want knowing his roommate/military brother is alone.", "I assumed thanksgiving was different\u2026like people all alone are generally welcomed somewhere. I\u2019m not American so this is an impression.", "I have an open house in general, but ESPECIALLY on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  \n\nI think I was like 7 maybe and my uncle's best friend came over for Christmas.  I asked my mom why he was there (even tho I loved him) because he wasn't family.  And she told me holidays are about friends and family and that he couldn't be with his bio family so he was celebrating with us. And besides that he WAS family and no one should have to be alone if they don't have to be and that's what we do for people.   \n\nI'm paraphrasing because I dont remember her exact words but I 100% remember having that conversation in my great grandmother's living room.\n\nIf my girlfriend waa like hey babe my friend is gonna be alone can she come? I'd instantly say yes, and then I'd just tell my mom we have an extra person coming cuz she can't be with her family. And she's be like okay cool, grab an extra bottle lol.  \n\nYou don't have to be that way, but I am and I'd like something close to that in return.", "Yeah I'm getting downvotes but whatever I'll die on that hill.\n\nI went to Thanksgiving with my ex once and it was at her aunt's place and said my cousin couldn't come.  So my cousin just sat alone at my place watching TV and are checkers.  \n\nThe entire time I was there I couldn't enjoy myself cuz j felt so guilty. I also so no real reason why he couldn't have attended while I was there.  This was like 10 years ago and I still remember it vividly.", "No excuse though I\u2019ve done long distance and I\u2019m also a military kid - there\u2019s a thing called video chats that has been around for years and with Covid (as they got together during Covid) there\u2019s so many virtual things they could have done.\n\nEdit note: when I dated anyone long distance I had them meet my best friends within the first month and interacted with them regularly. The fact that they don\u2019t know either family for friends/roommates in any form and are considered strangers is a big flag for me.", "If they are both military and roommates, and BF's roommate can't see his family for the holidays, pretty sure I can see the thought process. BF is worried about his friend. Lots of service members cut off from family and stuck in the barracks get *really* bad around the holidays. Especially since the workload gets pretty hectic. (They force you to go to two or three \"fun days\" a week, but you have to get the same amount of work done as a regular week. In half the time with usually half the people.)\n\nBF is probably worried his boy will either a) get way too drunk and do something stupid or b) intentionally hurt himself. Also might not want to come out and say this because it looks and sounds bad. \"I'm not ok, but I will be\" is a phrase you hear all the time. It usually translates to \"I am terrified or extremely hurt, but I'm gonna complete the mission.\"\n\nThis is sort of a NAH in this particular situation, because bf has the right to ask, op has right to say no. Also sort of ESH because there's probably a lot more going on that isn't going to be talked about because it's too uncomfortable, but absolutely needs to be talked about when everyone can handle doing so.", "This is how my family is and I don\u2019t understand most of these comments. It\u2019s thanksgiving!!  This would seriously make me question this relationship. If you can\u2019t trust my close friends what does that say about your real opinion of me?  You meet them and they do something I\u2019ll cut them off but making someone close to your partner spend thanksgiving alone is heartless.", "Yeah that\u2019s kind of a strange thing to be worried about. She\u2019s worried that the friend will get all the attention instead of her bringing home a serious boyfriend?", "At the same time if I was the bf and my close friend was about to spend thanksgiving alone I\u2019d be heartbroken and (ask permission then) make him come.", "It\u2019s not really odd at all. Honestly if I was the BF I\u2019d be more likely to cancel so my buddy isn\u2019t alone.", "Totally understand bringing them to your own family's thanksgiving/holiday/party whatever. What is weird is that BF hasn't met OP's family yet, and OP doesn't know the roommate. This whole situation is weird to me. \n\nI have brought random friends, occasional BF for Thanksgiving myself. I never would ask or bring my best friend or siblings first time I met my husband's family. My family's, sure.", "Spending more time with him...before tomorrow? BF sprung thus on her at the very last minute. It's also not his event to randomly invite another person to. It's just rude to ask to bring a +1 when you don't know anyone and you're already a +1.\n\nI also don't understand why the BF is 'working through having to tell him' anything? If he didn't have plans this weekend wouldn't he already be expecting to be on his own? Did he just expect to be invited to his roommate's new girlfriend's parents house for the holidays?", "I think it's a household to household thing. Some people grow up in households that aren't as open to other people coming around. I've been to my friends get togethers for holidays, and I would have never invited someone else that they didn't know. (But that may have been the vibe their family gave off). My dad welcomed everyone to our house, so I wouldn't mind if it was my own families.", "Usually that IS how it goes because that IS what thanksgiving is really about; being thankful for what you have, however/whatever it may be and sharing it with those you care about and those who can\u2019t be with their loved ones.", "Great but this is a massive relationship milestone that happens to fall on a holiday. This isn't any normal thanksgiving. It's a special one. Your rules don't apply and he's basically telling OP that his roommate's feelings matter more than hers. Yikes.", "I love that for you guys. My dad didn't care if our friends were over whenever, and I also spent a lot of holidays at some of my friends families. I personally plan on having an open house to my son's friends when they're older. It's awesome to be that welcoming BUT I also can understand why OP would only want it to be her BF while he's meeting her family for the first time. I would think that the BF would be preoccupied trying to keep his friend comfortable that he wouldn't be as into conversations with her family (but I could be assuming wrong) It might turn into him and his friends hanging out as the new comers instead of him being there with OP. NAH, her BF is allowed to ask, and OP is allowed to say no. IMO", "When you say military kid do you mean you\u2019ve served or your family was military?", "Thank goodness I am seeing these comments. I am so confused by most of the other comments who would not accept this friend for dinner. I couldn't imagine turning down a request like that and I certainly wouldn't date someone who would.", "They\u2019re in the military they can\u2019t exactly plan out flights home months in advance. They often don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll get leave until the week of. Those are important details to why YTA", "My dad served not myself personally but I\u2019ve been close friends with and known military people from most of the branches my whole life and even briefly dated some and I\u2019ve also had long distance relationships with non military so I\u2019m also speaking from experience in a variety of forms.", "NAH - thanksgiving varies, family varies, what seems like a no big deal request for one can be super difficult for another. For some households thanksgiving means a big crowd and the more the merrier, for others not so much. It would have been awkward to have random people at my bio parents, it was usually just the three of us, or two, since it was common to have one person freak out and leave, something I was willing to subject exactly one understanding boyfriend to once. But my foster fam: they are a welcoming bunch and tend to have big potluck style holidays or multiple activities / options over a couple of days so it would be pretty easy to accommodate one more last minute. I think it's common to have big welcoming thanksgivings but it's also not uncommon to have high stress dysfunctional ones, don't know what kind OP's family usually has. Some families budgets or planning styles or stress and labor efforts would make adding in one more person a big challenge (food expenses, preplanned portions and place settings instead of all you can eat style, a host who's already struggling to do all the things).", "I think this really depends on the family\u2026 My family has always gladly taken in \u201cstrays\u201d for holidays, as has my husbands. One of our favorite thanksgivings to date is when my husband\u2019s best friend brought his THREE college roomies to thanksgiving while they were over here for school and obviously didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go. They were utterly delighted to partake in a \u201ctraditional American holiday\u201d. My husband\u2019s family still loves to talk about the year of the Dutch Bros lol. Personally seems pretty heartless to not even give the hosts the option to open their doors to someone actively fighting for their right to eat turkey\u2026. This has the potential to be a very fun thanksgiving to look back on as you begin to spend many more together as a couple. Who knows, maybe your parents would have gently said no anyway and then it would\u2019ve been out of your hands. But again - different folks, different strokes.", "Maybe I've been away from the US for too long (35 yrs) but there would NEVER be an \"unwanted\" guest at our Thanksgiving table.

But keep this in mind, how you treat others is a reflection of your character. In your bf eyes he may see you as something that's not so flattering for being so focused on the first meeting being perfect and dismissing his concern for his friend who will not be able to see his family during a special holiday that's menat for family and friends to be together and be thankful. You have every right to say no BUT be aware that your decisions may have consequences", "NAH. I can definitely see that this is important to you and it would make it harder for your family to get to know your BF if he\u2019s entertaining his friend. \n\nOn the other hand, your bf might have some reasons for inviting his roommate: \n1. What if he assumed his roommate had plans and then found out today he didn\u2019t have any and didn\u2019t want his friend to be alone? \n2. What if your boyfriend is nervous and wants someone else there besides you as a \u201csafety net\u201d to make things easier?

I understand your desire to want this to be about you and your family. I truly do. But, people who serve together become family, oftentimes that bond is lifelong.

When I was first separated from my husband, one of the girls I was friendly with at work but not close (we're much closer now) found out I had no family in the state, and had me come with her to her mother's for Thanksgiving.  My husband's family has \"adopted\" kids who were friends of their kids in high school, and for whatever reason needed a safe space or a stable place to live for a time, and are now just considered part of the family (though one of them actually did marry in), and they would also be the type to tell their kids to bring people to the holidays if they had nowhere to go. \n\nI also understand that there are families who are much more private, and consider holidays a much more family-only activity.  I am not going to say that either set of beliefs or customs are wrong...but they may not be compatible.  Two people with vastly differing beliefs about this are going to have trouble hosting the holidays together as a couple.  One person will feel constantly intruded on, or the other will feel like their partner has no compassion or room for other people who don't have family on these days.  That creates a strain, and there may be a moral judgement attached to the other's attitude if they feel it either devalues their family relationships, or shows a coldness to other people.  \n\nI do think this may be something which ends the relationship, or at least gives him pause about whether you two would be compatible long term. I'm not telling you to change your comfort zone- just to set realistic expectations about what will happen with a partner who finds your boundaries incompatible with their beliefs and ideas about friends and family. \n\nI am sort of curious, though, if you know your family would say yes why you seem to have such different views than you grew up with on such things? Not to justify yourself, but just wondering why you seem to feel so differently from how your family would.", "Well he asked. You didn't ask the hosts (your parents) but  instead immediately said no...and he knows that. \nYou stated him and his roommate are both military and both stationed away from their families.

For others, getting together on holidays as an intimate group is the way that they keep connected as a family.\n\nIf this is a deal-breaker for him - then it\u2019s not really about his friend. I doubt his friend is more important to him than his partner - especially as she doesn\u2019t really know roommate. But what it could be is a rejection of her family\u2019s interpersonal style.\n\nIt\u2019s not his event, he doesn\u2019t get to use his partner as an extension of his own generosity / let alone her parents. \n\nBut I do really take issue with you assuming that not inviting them has anything to do with her heart.

If he was worried about the roommate then he should have made the roommate HER friend by having him around more. If she's not military or from military its odd to think you're a packaged deal.  I'd wonder as a parent why he needs his friend and roommate there for the first time meeting who isn't a friend of my daughter at all. A first dinner, a first meet and greet to the family if VERY important.  This means she's taking the relationship seriously.   \n\nMy worry would be is the new BF really taking this relationship seriously.  Is he actually gay using her as a beard keeping her tricked.  Those things happen. Since I have only heard about the new BF so far. Love can be blinding.  OR he could feel he needs the back up because he's nervous therefore I'd wonder if he doesn't have what it takes to be a good partner. Having some backbone or nerve is important. Maybe he needs to grow up a bit. Those are two things that would cross my mind when meeting the BF for the first time at a gathering not hosted by my daughter with someone she isn't fully comfortable with in tow who isn't invited.   If this was maybe the third meeting or a event in the park pot luck/banquet style is different. If it was a brother or cousin who dropped in from out of town okay. But this roommate could have made plans himself.   Thanksgiving isn't a last minute thing. Both knew it was coming. If the BF knew then the roommate could have made plans with some of his family like military family for the holiday.  Bad planning. Or he could have planned the BF would have threw a fit and ditched it to \"hand\" with him. Or the BF actually doesn't want to go but hopped his friend could come, make it better and get free food.  If he couldn't hack it, should be honest.  Whatever the motive, BF definitely knew how important this was to her. \n\nHolding it against OP for saying NO, when it was rude in the first place is wrong.   Didn't hurt to ask but the \"I'm not okay you said no,\" is stupid.   Why is the roommate such a bad planner? Does he not have any other friends or family in the area?

That's my question.", "BF hasn\u2019t met her family yet - NTA.", "I understand where you're coming from but it's the first time meeting family and it's just not appropriate.

They need to be getting to know each other without a wild card in the dynamic", "I don't think OP is an asshole here but asking for a little time to think/process stuff isn't giving the silent treatment and isn't immature", "He's not giving the silent treatment though? He had no problem talking with her he just wasn't super thrilled his friend is being left out and so she literally told him to reach out when he feels better. It's only been hours. It's completely reasonable for someone to be disappointed and need some space to get over it. He wasnt guilting her or trying to convince her to change her mind. He communicated clearly that he needed some space to get over his disappointment. That *is* very mature.", "Not really silent treatment. Silent treatment is not talking as a punishment to the other person. Not simply not talking because you don't feel like it.", "> Leave requests can be denied last minute \n\nAnd some people that may know they'll not be going anywhere won't say something until last minute, either because they think they won't care or just don't want to impose to eagerly.", "He asked if his friend could come with and accepted her answer. There is literally no harm in asking and there\u2019s also nothing wrong with being disappointed in the answer and needing space. They\u2019ve literally only not talked for a few hours.

I say NAH, he had every right to ask and she had every right to say no.", "He can go to a USO office then.", "To be fair, OP acknowledges that their family would gladly have said yes to adding the plus one. It's not so much that an unexpected guest would not have been accommodated but that the OP is so focused on making the first meeting with the parents perfect despite the bf wanting to include a military member who would be alone on a special holiday. This can reflect poorly on OP from bf's eyes. Yes, she has every right to say no but she must also accept that this can reflect bad character from their bf's perspective", "I never had to ask. Never.\n\nAnd later, after I married, we hosted several unaccompanied squadron members for the holidays every year until I separated.

Bf is from a different culture, and yes, military people who've been in as long as he has count as culture. Your squadmates can become family. Everything is very last minute because the military denies and overwrites leave all the time, so flexibility is a must. If he came from a military family, inviting strangers to TG and other holidays was likely a regular occurrence. Judging people for a different culture is shaky, entitled ground. Not everyone has to think like you.\n\n2. See point one. Strangers and meeting strange families just isn't as big of a deal in military circles. He's probably not being rude or insensitive from his perspective, just trying to extend kindness to his buddy who'd be alone.\n\n3. You can ask for things and people can say no. And you're allowed to have emotional responses to those answers and process them as long as you communicate. Nothing OP stated was unreasonable. I don't have to smile and act happy when your boundaries are disappointing, I just have to respect them and not punish you for them.\n\nHe's not married, they don't give you off post housing 90% of the time if you're not married.

Visit to HER family --> this event is about HER not about HIM", "If I was the girl, I would feel emotionally ignored that my boyfriend is more concerned about where his friend will be on Thanksgiving versus thinking about the step we're taking forward meeting my parents for the first time.", "This is very beside the point though.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it would or wouldn't inconvenience her family or the food portions - it's about the fact she wants to have an emotional milestone with her partner and family with the intimacy and privacy to match, and having someone there whose an acquaintance at most to her and a stranger to them imposes on that.\n\nAnd the fact the boyfriend more or less manufactured this conflict for no real reason as the roommate didn't even know he'd been invited and had his own plans for the holiday just makes the boyfriend look like he was deliberately trying to avoid the exact emotional gravity of the meeting OP wants to engage in.", "Her post says room mate is military- and even if he is the bf brother and in the military- the same reasons could apply as to why she doesn\u2019t know him well yet. \nI just don\u2019t see the huge ordeal in allowing a lone military member to be included in a holiday meal. I think it reflects well on the bf for asking- and not so well for her refusing to even consider it.", "We can ask why is this the first time that she's introducing her boyfriend to her family. This is heartless move.", "She kind of is, though... because this is a holiday for the whole family/ country. Thanksgiving isn't about OP and her boyfriend. I get that this meeting is important to her and that's completely reasonable. But does everyone else there have to put their holiday on hold because this year is about OP and her boyfriend? Can no one else invite guests OP doesn't know or make pregnancy/ engagement announcements at the table because this year is about them? Of course not. Thanksgiving is bigger than this couple meeting the parents, and it's kind of selfish to unilaterally decide that a whole family holiday is about you. Her boyfriend is also celebrating Thanksgiving and would like his friend there if their hosts are willing. I think if she wanted to have a meal be all about her and this step forward in her relationship, they should pick a different day. Or arrive early and spend time together before the rest of the guests get there. \n\nAlso...I realize this sounds like I think Thanksgiving is some sacred national thing. I don't even like Thanksgiving. I'm just saying.... you can't just decide a whole holiday is going to be about you and your relationship. YTA, OP", "That's just it. OP is all about \"the day being about her\" while someone sits alone without their family because they are active duty. And boyfriend is active duty? Guarantee he is thinking this thru tonight.", "Some of it is about Thanksgiving and some of it also probably breaks down by cultural, regional, and individual family expectations. I'm from the South, which traditionally places a big emphasis on hospitality, so in my family, knowing someone will be alone for Thanksgiving and not inviting them would be really looked down on. My family Thanksgivings have included complete strangers and family friends and other people's relatives. \n\nFor us, about half the Thanksgiving guest list this year is family by blood or marriage plus 2 people who are related to an in-law and another family from abroad who are friends of someone else attending but are super excited about celebrating a traditional Thanksgiving. This was our same formula last time, though one of in-law relatives is different this time around. (Someone's sibling versus someone's nephew.) I really only know half the people who will be there.  \n\nI noted in another comment, my family often combines Christmas with Thanksgiving for one branch of the family, and we have extra gifts and cards on hand for anyone else in attendance, so they don't feel left out. That's probably not as normal, but that's very much the spirit of the holiday that I was raised with--being kind and welcoming to people, regardless of how you know them or even if you know them.", "Christmas is maybe a little different, but we frequently had friends or neighbors come to thanksgiving if they didn\u2019t have anyone to spend it with, like if parents had to work, or if they were living far from home and couldn\u2019t go home for the holiday.  It really is a thing.", "It\u2019s different for everyone. I, too, am from the \u201cSouth\u201d, and no friggin way would I be ok with my bf inviting some guy I barely know to this event. I\u2019d feel differently and would be open to the friend being included IF\u2026\n\n-My bf had already met my family \n\n-I myself knew the friend better, and/or \n\n-if I cleared it with whoever was hosting first. This part is important because if the host is cooking a meal and anticipating a certain number of guests, the addition of an unexpected guest would potentially mean that the host would need to make *more* food, possibly venture back to the store (which would be a nightmare at this point what with it being last minute and the stores are not only crowded but in a lot of instances, they\u2019re running out of stuff), and adjust my planning entirely. Some of these people have never hosted an event like this or cooked a huge meal and it really shows. To just spring a surprise guest on the host at the last minute is *incredibly* rude and inconsiderate. To hell with so-called \u201csouthern hospitality\u201d! \n\nAnd all these comments saying \u201cmy family would be *appalled* if I didn\u2019t include someone for Thanksgiving\u2026\u201d \n\nOk. And?? We\u2019re not talking about *your* family. Every family is different. And OP is completely within reason to not want a guy that, to be fair, is a complete *stranger* to her, to be present at an event that will serve as the *first time* her bf meets her parents and extended family.", "Yes, yes, yes, a thousand times YES. Damn I wish I had coins to give you an award because this comment *truly* deserves it. \n\nIn the meantime I can at least give you this \ud83c\udfc6", "THANK YOU!! Every other commentor is acting like the holiday itself somehow magically bends all rules of family dynamics. Newsflash, it doesn't. You wouldn't do this if it were a regular family dinner with a first meeting? I know people like to think opening your home to strangers is SUPER common practice but it isn't. We aren't talking about what all of you WOULD do on your moral high grounds, this guy is stranger to her. If this were any other dinner OPs BF would be completely the AH for asking especially considering he has never met these people and for putting her into such an awkward position as asking her family so close to the day of. \n\nIf OPs family is viewing this meeting the same way she is, how does it look that this strange man (bf) has tried to invite some stranger into their home the first time they are meeting him? If this were any other dinner OPs BF would be getting labeled the AH. And add to it the BF wasn't just audacious enough to put OP in this position he did so without even asking the roommate first. \n\nThis is man making all sorts of decisions for the people around him without discussing any of it with them. That's the bigger problem here.", "The edit OP added makes the boyfriend look even worse!\n\nThe boyfriend didn't even ask his roomie if he wanted to come nor did the roomie express a desire to come. The boyfriend just assumed the roomie wouldn't have plans by the sound of it only for the roomie to actually have conflicting plans.\n\nSo she apologized to her boyfriend over an issue *he completely caused* that didn't end up inconveniencing the roommate in any way, shape or form.", "It's not a wingman, it's a close friend who is home alone for the HOLIDAYS.  And to me that's the issue it's not about her or him it's about leaving someone stranded and not really caring.", "Yeah, if I was OP, I would be totally put off by my bf\u2019s insistence that his friend come along because he would otherwise be alone on Thanksgiving. What the *hell* is so terrible about being alone on Thanksgiving??? I\u2019m American and totally understand the hype surrounding it, but being alone on Thanksgiving is *not* the end of the world. Christmas, MAYBE, but Thanksgiving???\n\nIf it were my bf trying to throw a wrench in my plans for him to meet my parents for the first time, I\u2019d be so irritated and pissed that I\u2019d tell him that if he\u2019s so concerned about his friend being alone on that day, then he can sit this one out and spend the day with his buddy instead of spending it with me and my family. Since his buddy\u2019s feelings are so GD important and all\u2026", ">He could be upset because he realizes that he and OP do not share some core values and that may make them incompatible\n\nThat's a big leap imo. OPs bf probably didn't think it would be a big deal to her seeing as they've been dating 1.5yrs\n\nI was dating this chick for all of 2 months and had to stop by an extended family members house to drop something off for my BIL so he could pick it up in the morning(his sisters house was half way). A bit short sighted on my end I guess but it was late at night and we were doing the post coitus cuddle so I asked if she wanted to tag along - not knowing they were having a party with his entire family there. Whom she met.. I didn't think anything of it but she thought I invited her so she could meet everyone and make it a serious relationship.. My thought process was hey.. it's late at night, we just banged it out, we could drop this off, get some food and keep eachother company for about a 2hr round trip drive\n\n\"Can I come in with you?\" yea.. \"are you sure? you don't mind if I come in the house with you?\" that should have been my hint she thought it was a big deal but I missed it and didn't think anything of it again until I broke it off with her and she said \"but I met your whole family\" and then I awkwardly explained that they're extended family, not direct", "Same. I come from a family where inviting people who would otherwise be alone is welcome and expected. I grew up with \u201cif you\u2019re friend, you\u2019re family.\u201d We had friends of friends at holiday events and were always embraced.", "If her family is so important to her, why doesn't the BF know her at all? \nSometime after the stars don't align, and with the friend in the military who knows when and how long he's deployed", "You\u2019ve made my night, thanks!", "Why are you guys so convinced that this will end the relationship? Bunch of drama llamas. The update sounds promising, because they just talked to each other.", "What dont you get??\n\nThey've been together awhile and..\n1- her BF hasn't bothered to introduce his 'close friend'\n2- first holiday meeting her parents.  Could set the whole tone of their future family dynamic.\n\n\nThe more the merrier thing is nice, but some days are special.  This is one of them for her.\n\nGuilt and shaming is a bad look for randos you have no clue are being as honest as they sound.\n\nSounds like a damn hallmark movie; let me guess, all your families volunteer at soup kitchens too..\n\nAlot of people say that, but soup kitchens always seem to need help??", "I agree It would ruin my holiday if my partners best friend had asked to come and I said no and he was alone for the holidays! Also it may be BF is nervous, she's surrounded by her family and he's basically alone in a room full of strangers, maybe he wanted someone to help break the ice. But then we are a the more the merrier family. I just don't see how having his friend come would ruin the holiday.", "The whole scenario would make me question the relationship. Why had I not met the family in a year and a half? After that long, why choose to introduce me at a family holiday when those are already so loaded with expectations? Had I met the family more informally before now, would she have said yes to the roommate coming? (i.e. Are our values around inclusion the same? She's already told him they are not and the roommate did not even want to go.)\n\nShe calls herself family-oriented yet doesn't see the importance of being around family together as a way to progress in a serious relationship.", "NAH, OP, though y'all should split up. Find yourself a nice civilian man, stay away from military folk, military isn't for you. I understand that you aren't part of us, so you don't get it, and that's okay. It simply means that you aren't compatible. This is only ONE aspect of our military family raising it's head. It will do so again. \n\nThe roommate is an \"orphan.\" We don't leave orphans alone on holidays. Period. 22 of our brothers and sisters unalive themselves a day on average, and that is higher during the holidays. We trust each other to have each other's backs, we trust each other with our lives, even if we've never met. If your bf and his roommate were where I'm at, I have them for Thanksgiving and Christmas so they have family around them. No idea who they are, and I don't care. It's immaterial. They're military, and they're away from loved ones, so I've got them, no questions asked. Matter of fact, I checked with our local base this past week to see how many orphans they need me to take this year; everyone's good to go. We take care of each other. IT'S WHAT WE DO, IT IS BY NATURE WHO WE ARE. You're interfering with that. \n\nWe are a family. These are my brothers and sisters, moms and dads, sons and daughters. Drunkest I ever got was after my grandpa's funeral, his surviving WWII buddies came, I got to be the NCOIC of his funeral (Non-commissioned Officer in Charge). One of his buddies trying to give me a bit of a hard time (that's what military often does to each other) said to me \"Huh. They allow females to be SGTs now?\" \"Yes, sir, we do.\" \"Ever have a problem with the menfolk not listening to you?\" \"Same as any other SGT, yes sir, I do.\" \"What do you do about it?\" \"Take 'em out back and kick the $#!^ out of 'em. They tend to listen after that, sir.\" He CRACKED up, called the rest of the guys over and told them what I said. We then all went to the local bar and got ABSOLUTELY RIPPED. They were WWII, Dad was Vietnam, I was Iraq. We all still had pretty much the same stories to share, mostly just locations and names changed. The rest of the funeral party had to come pick us up, we were too drunk even to walk home \ud83d\ude02 Never met them before, but I got totally faced with a bunch of 90 year olds, because we're family.", "YTA. Do you even understand the meaning of Thanksgiving? Someone is alone and without family nearby; you count them in. Leaving an acquaintance and good friend of your partner alone for a holiday is mean spirited.", "If this was my family... I'd be guilted so hard I wouldn't be able to eat. Hard YTA. You said your family would say that it was fine, so basically you would rather someone be alone on Thanksgiving than share your boyfriend for the day. This holiday is supposed to be about family and friends coming together, and sharing what we have with others. We almost always have one or two people that only one person in the family knows, it's never been an issue at all. \n\nYour boyfriend is upset because he feels like he has to abandon his friend. Do you want him to come spend the day with your family feeling guilty and sad about his friend sitting at home by himself? Do you think it's going to be a positive experience for him?", "Yes and then the edit - the roommate didn\u2019t even know about any of this!\n\nBoyfriend sounds quite manipulative, he is a champion of making OP feel like TA.", "I think the BF is a massive AH for some of the reasons that you mentioned, and more. \n\nIt was a super last minute request and he basically pouted and sulked when he got told no. Like you said, this is very rude to the host. Thanksgiving isn't a 'the more the merrier' type situation in some families. Food and seating is involved, and the host shouldnt be put in the position to scramble to fit an extra person. \n\nBasically pouting and being a emotionally manipulative that OP dare to decline his last minute invite request.\n\nMinimizing how important this first meeting was for OP (which many other commenters have also done). That first meeting in a relationship is very important for many people, like OP. I get the BF wanting to be kind to his roommate, but his response to \"no\" was an AH move.  \n\nHe didn't even ask his roommate if he wanted to come to this dinner - where he would be the third wheel as his roommate met his GS family for the first time. The BF tried to make OP feel guilty about declining this last minute invite, when the roommate couldn't even attend the dinner in the first place.", "THIS.  THIS is what I thought.  I think this is his main reason to invite the roommate and why he\u2019s so unreasonably pissy about it, considering he didn\u2019t even know that the roommate already had plans.", "People really believe OP is an asshole for not inviting someone she doesn\u2019t know well to a Thanksgiving dinner that she isn\u2019t even hosting???? If this is the bar for asshole, we\u2019re all going down", "May I ask how many strangers who would be alone otherwise you're hosting this thanksgiving?", "Definitely a problem if he\u2019s 8 years old", "I saw the edits on your final post but was wondering about your BF's military status. You're NTA, to be clear. Introducing a significant other to your family should be a special moment.\n\nJust wanted to include that military friends, especially roommates, can be like family. Neither of them have family nearby, so service members lean on each other as family. I'd still prefer to spend Thanksgiving with my Army over dealing with the bullshit drama my sisters always bring haha.", "I just don't get why he even asked, let alone pouted and sulked until he got a yes, when he hadn't even asked his roommate if this was something he wanted. \n\nI don't know about you, but I would never want to be the third wheel when my roommate meets their SO's family for the first time - especially so if I am practically a stranger to the SO - especially if it's at a major holiday.", "Nta! You have your boundaries, he has to respect them, it was supposed to be the first time meeting your parents! \n\nHe can hit the road.\nMost answers here reek of stolen valor.\n\nThe ones saying yta, have their heads up to their \u201cbrothers in arms\u201d arses, they can\u2019t see family values alone.", "I accidentally skipped over that part when initially reading. Someone above mentioned it, and my eyebrows almost shot into my hairline. It\u2019s extremely concerning behavior. This worries me.", "I have been alone for *a lot* of major holidays. It\u2019s really not that big of a deal. You can just use the opportunity to spend a relaxing day at home doing whatever you want to do. The only time it\u2019s going to be depressing is if the reason you\u2019re alone is depressing by itself, eg your entire family was murdered, or they\u2019ve disowned you for being gay. Simply being unable to go home because you have work commitments isn\u2019t traumatic. \n\n\u201cStrangers are better than nothing\u201d is some awfully codependent and unhealthy shit. \n\nI\u2019ve also been invited to spend Christmas with others a few times, and it\u2019s goddamn **fucking awful**. Worst Christmas. I\u2019d much rather be alone than have to deal with that awkwardness and stress again. If anyone invites me these days then I know they\u2019re not my friend because a friend would know that I\u2019m not going to enjoy Christmas with strangers. \n\nSeems like the Bf\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d didn\u2019t want to come over either, so can\u2019t be much of a friend if he didn\u2019t know that.", "First reasonable response I've read so far. Definitely NTA.", "I agree. I grew up in a military family and we lived a country that wasn't the US for many years. We often hosted single men for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners that couldn't fly home for the holidays. My family barely knew them but my father was the co-host so it really wasn't a big deal. It would have been a big deal to invite an unknown friend to an extended family member's dinner.\n\nI think if the bf had a previous relationship with OP's family, it would be more acceptable, even if OP didn't really know the roommate that well. I don't think it's appropriate that he bring a friend along for the first time meeting them. If the bf had met OP's family previously, I would maybe lean towards AH. But a first meet with family plus an unknown friend is not worth the stress and anxiety OP would feel during dinner, imo.\n\nI absolutely appreciate the bf's kindness to include his friend/roommate though", "Bf is in the military, and this is his roommate on base. OP is free to do as she pleases, but it\u2019s not a good look for her to her bf that she refused to even ask if his fellow servicemen be allowed to dinner.

And not being \u2018polite\u2019 to ask if someone with no place to go can come to a thanksgiving dinner must be some new tradition I\u2019ve never heard of.

I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s a first holiday event, she barely knows the guy. I\u2019m not having a stranger with me", "typo :(", "As an American I think you are misunderstanding. The fact that the guy is in the military is only relevant as an explanation for why he\u2019s alone on Thanksgiving.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty common to invite people to Thanksgiving who otherwise have nowhere to go, even complete strangers. The sharing and generosity are part of the holiday.\n\nObviously not everyone does this, but I think you\u2019d get the exact same responses from people whether the guy was in the military or not.", "This isn\u2019t a military thing so much as a thanksgiving thing for many people. I\u2019ve never heard of a family that wouldn\u2019t be kind of excited and honored that someone without a family to go to came to their dinner, because the holiday is about sharing with people who don\u2019t have. It\u2019s just odd to celebrate that holiday without that spirit (which it doesn\u2019t sound like the parents are, which is why they wouldn\u2019t have a problem). I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s obligated, just explaining why so many Americans might find it surprising that someone has an issue with someone asking for a friend (and the military only coming up as an explanation as to why it might be last minute out of necessity).", "The crazy part is, most military members I\u2019ve come across always feel so awkward when the civilians start their semi-worship thing.

He hates it when strangers find out and thank him for his service because he doesn\u2019t know how to respond without sounding like an ass. Both my nephews were also in the military, different branches. Same thing. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just my family members.

Who knew so many people wouldn't extend such a unique/special kindness that is inherent to the holiday? I've always loved Thanksgiving for this reason.

If my family finds out I know about a friend who's alone for a holiday and I don't invite them, they'd be pretty mad too.\n\nI've had some fun Christmases at home where there was a pretty odd selection of random people (and some strangers to me) at our place.", "And the roommate doesn't even *want* to go and has his own plans!\n\nBoyfriend pretty clearly just fears getting through this emotional milestone and tried to manufacture some roadblock to either kneecap it or forcefully volunteer someone to wingman him through it.", "Then maybe talk about it when making the original plans, like when you first agree to come over? Springing it on someone shortly before Thanksgiving (I assume Thanksgiving is very soon) is a dick move, and then sulking about getting told No is a double dick move.\n\nMeeting family for the first time is a big deal to most people and it's disrespectful to take away from that occasion.

Not much I can do there\n\nBut to not even ask? That would upset me", "...\nHe asked to bring someone to share not just any event,  but Thanksgiving.

This would be my exact reaction to this situation and I\u2019m from New England.\n\nI am sure my family would begrudgingly OK the extra guest but they\u2019d be judging the BF for being rude and inviting an extra person, and it is rude to invite an extra person - a stranger - when the family hasn\u2019t even met the BF. Plus, it\u2019s incredibly last minute. People have already shopped for food.

She seems pretty clueless about military culture and he seems career military (if this turns into a serious relationship, she is in for a very rude awakening if she is that inflexible as a military spouse) and their initial lack of communication is almost worthy of a bad sitcom episode. She never asks why it's last minute and he never explains. They also seem to have a pretty big disparity in views on hospitality and family, which again points to, at the very least, a huge potential problem if she ends up being a military spouse and I'm not sure he's the type who is going to make it any easier. \n \nMost of it was me looking through as the lens of her seeming to find the relationship pretty significant while still seeming to be so clueless about military culture because I've seen this dynamic happen and it often doesn't end well because the civilian side is so blindsided and confused by the reality of being with someone in the military and the military side is so frustrated and blindsided because they incorrectly assumed the person was ready. I wouldn't have had quite the same reaction if they were both civilians. \n\nSo, I don't really think it is being a drama llama to interpret his initial response as potentially ominous for the relationship without her apologizing and making an effort to invite the roommate like she did. It's good they seemed to have worked it out and are moving forward. Hopefully they learn from it and grow together as a couple.

Some families operate with kind of an \"open table\" attitude over the holidays -- others do not and even bringing her BF could be seen as \"inviting a stranger\" into their family time.  She's the one who, with experience and knowledge of her own family's attitudes toward such, has to decide whether such a last minute request would be taken well, or would cause strife in the family.  It's a lot to ask someone who's probably been working on a holiday meal for days, to have to readjust to extra people at the table last minute.  It can mean having to add a dish or two so that there's more food to accommodate such a request.\n\nAdd in that her BF hasn't even met her family before -- but wanted to ask them to accommodate yet another unknown person at the table.....  how that is taken depends a lot on the family's attitude toward the holidays.

There were at most 6 people, and bringing a roommate could make it more awkward if it was also the first meeting between parents and bf.

He also knew the importance of this day, he also knew he was meeting your family for the first time, he also knew you don\u2019t really know his roommate\u2026\n\nHe asked anyway.\n\nAnd you didn\u2019t trust that he wanted what you did for this meeting or understood your plans. You didn\u2019t trust that he wouldn\u2019t have asked if it wasn\u2019t important. And you didn\u2019t partner up with him with compassion for his values. \n\nLike what ProfPlum said, don\u2019t be surprised if this is the beginning of the end. Though you updated that you changed your answer so that\u2019s a hopeful sign.\n\nHopeful today goes really well.", "I disagree especially because he asked the day before and I think that makes him TA. If he'd asked a week ago then maybe she could have done a low key intro with bf  and brought his friend on the day. But I think it is weird for the bf to think he can bring a friend who has barely met OP to her parents house who he also hasn't met for thanksgiving. It's fine to ask, it's fine if it's a no.", "Totally disagree.\nHe has invited a practical stranger to a family's dinner he hasn't even met.\nMeeting family for the first time is a big deal to many people, it's almost as if he's communicating that it isn't.\nAlso wtf, asking the literal day before? Nope, rude.", "I wouldn't even think soft. How are YOU as the plus one meeting a family for the first time gonna try to last minute a plus one for yourself that literally NO ONE knows? She's NTA", "Was it \u201cworth him thinking differently\u201d of the OP? Are you serious? So she should be a meek and submissive gf and never let him know if something upsets her or ever voice her opinion? \n\n\nIf the bf doesn\u2019t like \u201cthis side of her\u201d (which is what, the side that stands up for herself?), then she should find out sooner rather than later. A lifelong partner should accept all sides of you.", "The boyfriend is visiting OP's family for the first time. Squeezing in someone she barely knows at the last minute is not really it, boundaries are boundaries. If she has to break her own to satisfy him there's a problem that needs to be discussed.", "If he mattered then why hasn\u2019t he tried to foster an actual relationship between OP and the roommate? Why didn\u2019t he ask sooner if he knew and was so concerned?", "It is a cult, thank you for noticing.", "If the boyfriend tell her family about this, that\u2019s so rude. He shouldn\u2019t be trying to make her look bad to her family.", "It's not a cultural thing around Thanksgiving. It's weird", "I wouldn't have a problem with that, but the first time meeting the GF's parents shouldn't include a room mate.  If the BF had already met the family and knew them, and if the GF was actually friends with the roommate all of those would be a different situation.", "That's an excellent point! If bringing an unexpected guest could cause a hardship, then it's more polite not to ask. That would put the host in an uncomfortable position of having to say that they can't afford to feed another person. \n\nI do understand why OP wants to have it be an intimate dinner with her boyfriend so everyone can get to know him, but it's sad to leave a service member alone on the holiday. If it was me, I'd approve the invite. I think it's the right thing to do. \n\nStill..I don't think anyone is exactly wrong here. It's just a clash of priorities.", "You say that, but my sister's ex tried to molest me and was a creep from the start. We tried welcoming him", "I hope you get there again someday soon", "That\u2019s really harsh to say \u201cbecause your heart isn\u2019t big enough,\u201d cause I\u2019m guessing most people on here haven\u2019t had this situation and wouldn\u2019t be genuinely good with having a stranger at their family Thanksgiving. Everyone thinks feeding the homeless is a good idea, but I\u2019m willing to bet 99% of people here who would support that don\u2019t actually help the homeless. It\u2019s also very inconsiderate to put this kind of ultimatum (because let\u2019s be honest, if you ask something and demand yes as the answer or you\u2019re not coming, then that is an ultimatum) and the boyfriend needs to understand and respect others\u2019 feelings. NTA", "Exactly. \u201cYeah, no. He\u2019s a stranger. Oh. He\u2019s in the military? Then oh of course! He\u2019s practically family.\u201d \n\nIf you don\u2019t even know anything outside of his name, he\u2019s basically a stranger.", "Do you understand how often these guys get relocated? He may have just been transferred to this base", "I come from an Irish Catholic family, and we're the same as you describe.   My mom (RIP) once invited a complete stranger to Thanksgiving dinner when she learned he had no one to celebrate with.  A co worker I barely knew insisted I join her family for Thanksgiving one year, when I couldn't go home to my family.   I'm glad it seems OP and her bf have talked it out.", "How much planning to you need for an extra person", "There is somewhat of a thing around Thanksgiving specifically about  inviting \"orphan\" acquaintances who don't have family nearby to spend the holiday with. Many families do. (An example is that grandma who went viral for texting a wrong number the family TG plans, then just invited the stranger and now they've been coming for 7 years). Very different from Christmas, where that would be really unusual. But it's by no means an obligation and this is not how it works.\n\nHow it works is that the HOST invites you, like any other social event. You don't invite yourself, let alone invite someone else when you are already one step removed from the hosts (a guest of a guest yourself). You can gently fish for an invitation and still be considered polite (\"Your tg sounds lovely! I won't be able to make it home this year myself *sad face*\"), but that's the limit. Some families or friend groups may have a \"the more the merrier\" policy around TG, but then that is KNOWN and again, coming from the hosts."]}
