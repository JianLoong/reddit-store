Tomorrow, he\u2019s coming to Thanksgiving dinner at my dad\u2019s house and meeting my family for the first time. I\u2019m extremely family oriented and it\u2019s so important to me that he\u2019s finally meeting them. This also means the world to my family because I rarely bring men home and they\u2019ve been wanting to meet him for a long time. He\u2019s aware of this and how much this meeting means to me and has assured me that he\u2019s looking forward to it too. \n\nThis afternoon, he asked if his roommate could come too. I was caught off guard and said no. I didn\u2019t even ask my family who I\u2019m sure would say yes, but it\u2019s a hard boundary for me. I barely know his roommate but he\u2019s military and will not be able to be with his own family for the holiday, which is why my boyfriend asked. I understand and appreciate his compassion and kindness but I need this event to be just him, me, and my family without his buddy who is a stranger to me. I called him to talk through it, but he\u2019s extremely upset and wasn\u2019t really responding. I asked if he\u2019s still coming and he said yes. Then, I asked if he\u2019s okay and he said no but that he will be. I told him to reach out to me when he\u2019s ready and that I understand if he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me right now so I haven\u2019t heard from him since the phone call a couple hours ago. I feel like a massive asshole but this is one of the rare events where I\u2019ve put my foot down in this relationship and refused to accommodate his wants.

You are clear what you want this visit to be about so I think your SO should try to understand that.", "NAH. You're allowed to set whatever boundaries you want, but don't be surprised if, after thinking it over, he decides it's a dealbreaker. People in the military together often become family to each other, so from his POV, you basically told him he has to leave a brother alone because your heart isn't big enough to include him. He'll probably honor his commitment to your family to attend, but I'll be very surprised if the relationship lasts past this weekend.", "INFO: The last line of your post about finally putting your foot down and not accommodating this one request or something to that nature seems odd.

If he's not deployed or on a military base, but is instead living in a private apartment as your boyfriend's roommate whey can't he enjoy Thanksgiving with his family?\n\nAnd why did he just ask this on Wednesday afternoon, after people have already planned the number of dinner guests, bought the food, etc.?", "INFO: why hasn\u2019t your bf met your family previously?

I personally think it would\u2019ve been good to see the bf interact with people he just met along with someone he is comfortable with.

Bf isn't wrong to want to make sure his roommate has somewhere to go for the holiday, but maybe meeting your parents for the first time isn't the best time to bring a friend.", "NAH.\n\nI think this is a situation in which you really need to consider military culture. \n\nIn a \u201cworld\u201d in which so many people can\u2019t be with extended family for holidays, it\u2019s customary for military personnel/families to invite others to join their own celebrations. It\u2019s very possible that your boyfriend found out his roommate has nowhere to go on Thanksgiving and wants to extend the invitation to join you according to custom. (It\u2019s also extremely possible that the Chain of Command has \u201cstrongly suggested\u201d that those with plans include their less fortunate comrades.)\n\nI understand why you\u2019d feel more comfortable not including the roommate. You\u2019re NTA for that. But your boyfriend is also NTA for being deeply disappointed that you\u2019re unwilling to budge on this.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the bond of those who serve together. It runs deep \u2014 especially if they\u2019ve seen combat together. Not every military spouse or significant other has to go \u201call in,\u201d but I\u2019d caution you to think about how you\u2019ll handle certain aspects of military life as a team \u2014 especially if things continue to progress.\n\nGood luck.\n\n(Note: I actually met my husband because of the \u201cleave no battle buddy behind\u201d mentality. His company had recently returned from a deployment, and a friend from college had a date with his roommate. At the last minute, his roommate found out he had no plans and refused to go on the date unless my friend found a date for him. One phone call later, enter me. We\u2019ve been married for 15 years \u2014 7 during which my husband was active duty and which included 3 year-plus deployments.

Because EVERYONE would be shocked and saddened. So you will fake it tomorrow. And not bring it up. Sure hope nobody asks your boyfriend. That will get awkward very fast.\n\nHardly the good impression you were hoping for.", "I get why it's not ideal for you, but isn't the whole point of Thanksgiving about being generous and welcoming? \n\nIt's a romanticized and probably untrue version of history, but according to tradition, on the first Thanksgiving the American Indians, who probably weren't thrilled about having the Pilgrims as their new neighbors, nonetheless shared their bounty with them as a gesture of goodwill.

Your bf may feel just as strongly, however, and he may see his roommate as family and he feels bad leaving him alone for the holiday.  This alone may put a taint on the picture perfect day you are trying to create and may be a sticking point that comes up later in your relationship.  \n\nSince, if I were in the same spot, I wouldn't hesitate to bring the roommate along, I don't have any appropriate advice to give you other then to caution you that this may bring blowback into your relationship in the future, so tread wisely!", "NTA.

The last minute request to bring him along with the fact that he\u2019s never met the family is a big deal. If it was his family or he\u2019d actually met them before it would be another deal but OP is being perfectly reasonable. Also if they live a drive away why not just come back to BF\u2019s place for drinks or desserts  or go to the bar together?

I'm the type to fall back on that mentality too, keep strangers out but there is a speciallness about holidays that does in some minute way bring people together. It also may be less stressful for the BF having someone around on \"his side\" so to speak, I'm sure you're family is fine people but I'd wager he may have some anxiety about the situation.", "YTA.

I have to say something because this rings alarm bells in my head. Please don't be guilted when you stand up for yourself. Sacrificing yourself for someone else's wants only ends in tears.

Proceed with at least some caution, and pay attention to his reaction any time you say \"no\" in future.", "NTA, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this causes a big problem in your relationship.

I think it's worth considering what this says about you to your fianc\u00e9 though. It would strike me as pretty cold blooded and it would make me second guess the relationship.

I think it would probably be good for his roommate to come with him, they\u2019ll be able to keep each other company when your family inevitably talks about things they aren\u2019t a part of.

I'd normally say NTA, but your boyfriend is the closest thing that guy has to family right now. Set your hard boundary, but maybe agree to a small special dinner at your boyfriends to include the roommate. It would allow for you to meet the roommate and for him to have a special meal that you all can make and enjoy together, but it wouldn't overstep the boundary you're making around your family.", "NTA for now because there is a very simple follow up conversation to have...ARE THERE ANY OTHER FRIENDS ON BASE THAT HE COULD REACH OUT TO?

Tomorrow, he\u2019s coming to Thanksgiving dinner at my dad\u2019s house and meeting my family for the first time. I\u2019m extremely family oriented and it\u2019s so important to me that he\u2019s finally meeting them. This also means the world to my family because I rarely bring men home and they\u2019ve been wanting to meet him for a long time. He\u2019s aware of this and how much this meeting means to me and has assured me that he\u2019s looking forward to it too. \n\nThis afternoon, he asked if his roommate could come too. I was caught off guard and said no. I didn\u2019t even ask my family who I\u2019m sure would say yes, but it\u2019s a hard boundary for me. I barely know his roommate but he\u2019s military and will not be able to be with his own family for the holiday, which is why my boyfriend asked. I understand and appreciate his compassion and kindness but I need this event to be just him, me, and my family without his buddy who is a stranger to me. I called him to talk through it, but he\u2019s extremely upset and wasn\u2019t really responding. I asked if he\u2019s still coming and he said yes. Then, I asked if he\u2019s okay and he said no but that he will be. I told him to reach out to me when he\u2019s ready and that I understand if he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me right now so I haven\u2019t heard from him since the phone call a couple hours ago.

I'll get to hear about what everyone is grateful for, not exactly an original tradition, but not one that we practiced in my family of origin.

I am writing all of this assuming you at least know that the roommate isn't a huge jerk or something though.", "YTA and I know this will be the minority opinion apparently. You obviously said that it wouldn't be a big deal to invite another person just that you didn't want to because this is your big moment. Obviously your boyfriend knows his roommate. What does it take to be kind to someone who doesn't have the ability to spend time with their family. It shows more about you that you are deliberately cutting someone out that you are indeed not obligated to invite but is an AH move.", "I\u2019d like to say NTA because I understand that you want this to be special, but it\u2019s thanksgiving. It\u2019s very much a family event, and this guy is going to be sitting at home alone. Are you obligated to invite him? No, of course not. But having him over would be the more kind, compassionate response. And I\u2019d guess your bf won\u2019t make a fuss tomorrow, but he\u2019s clearly upset with you and probably won\u2019t forget it.", "NTA, him waiting to the last minute to ask this was him being not only disrespectful to you, but to your parents the hosts. He is expecting you last minute to play messenger to your parents to ask permission to bring another stranger, cuz your boyfriend is a stranger, to their family event when you yourself are not comfortable with that stranger being there.\n\nIt's a problem that he is not only expecting you to jump when he says jump, but the fact that you are noting that you have noticed him trying to push your boundaries and get you to jump when he wants to. Given that so many people are bringing up his military service like it's irrelevant detail, it means he and his friend have the option of not being alone on Thanksgiving cuz they will be there with other servicemen. Him demanding entry to your parents' event is not only showing a fundamental lack of respect for your parents, but for you. If you are feeling something in your gut, listen to your gut. You shouldn't feel like an asshole because you want basic boundaries", "OMG  my heart is kinda breaking for this poor guy without a family to be with for Thanksgiving, and OP saying no. Holy crap. Thanksgiving is all about including the random orphan, and doing it with love. I\u2019m so sorry OP that you are being so selfish on a day where it is about inclusion of everyone and thanking the universe for our community. Love is not a finite thing.", "YTA!! You can not bring your bf roommate for Thanksgiving but he is NEVER going to forget that you left his roommate out and alone on Thanksgiving.", "YTA.  He has nowhere else to go and it sounds like your family will welcome him.  His presence will also take some of the pressure off your boyfriend.  Kind of a buffer?  Because meeting your parents/ family for the first time on Thanksgiving is a LOT of pressure.  Be a decent person and change your mind.", "If you are so family oriented, what haven\u2019t they met him after a year and a half?", "Tbh I\u2019m just shocked that you have gone about a year and a half without having him meet your family. I\u2019ll never understand why people wait so long but I\u2019m going with a soft YTA. Thanksgiving and Christmas are both holidays that are inclusive of everyone and I think that y\u2019all should have met on a non holiday occasion as there\u2019s also going to be holiday stress in play. And as a military kid I also will say I think your boyfriend has every right to be upset with you, however I\u2019m again so confused how you don\u2019t know boss roommate. Do y\u2019all like just not get together with friends or family ever? If I never knew my boyfriends best friends or family in over a year even I\u2019d be concerned. I think y\u2019all need to evaluate some things and get on the same page - like why did you wait so long to meet family, let alone friends? None of this makes any sense to me", "Thanksgiving where you express gratitude for all you have...and refuse to let someone that has nowhere else to go come along.\nGlad my house has always been that anyone can bring anyone.  Only rule is everyone helps clean up.", "YTA. I had to spend Christmas alone one year, and being alone for the holidays can be extremely depressing. You mentioned that you appreciate your boyfriend\u2019s compassion, but you don\u2019t seem to have any yourself.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend has no business inviting someone else to an event neither of you are hosting.", "If anything, your family would get to see your bf's compassionate side by having his roommate along. But your bf is seeing your less than compassionate side, although I do understand your reasoning.", "Is there logic to your choice? Sure. Does that make it the right or moral choice? No. You have the power to make someone's Thanksgiving less lonely in an incredibly easy way, which should be enough. On top of that, it's something that matters to your bf and costs you nothing. Not to mention, while you should invite anyone, this is a service person who may one day put their life on the line for you, and that does make it even worse.\n\nYou have no real reason to say no other than it ruins your perfect image of the day. YTA. Your bf is going to break up with you as well, because things like this will seep into his opinion of you (rightfully so).", "A lot of differences of opinions here but I'm going to say a very slight YTA. You've been dating your SO for over a year and a half and your family has never met him, nor have you met his roommate? His roommate is a stranger to you and your BF is a stranger to your family. This is the time to get to know everyone and it would be nice to extend the invite to someone who will be alone this holiday season. You know your family will be more than happy to have an extra person, so why not? Your family will be interested to get to know both. Now your bf is upset and in a way I don't blame him, but on the other hand he kinda put this on you last minute.", "YTA \n\nI would never leave someone alone on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter if it was within my power to allow them to come. It\u2019s a huge sign of compassion to me. If I were your boyfriend, this would be a deal breaker for me.", "YTA. I think you should reflect on what the holiday season means and how we should act towards each other during the season (and beyond). I can\u2019t think of a single reason why excluding your boyfriend\u2019s roommate is in the spirit of gratitude, kindness, and even family. \n\nAdd the fact that the roommate is an active duty military member with nowhere to go, my goodness you are a jerk.", "I think you're a selfish (fill in the blank) What the hell is the big deal? The guy's military. He has no place to go and you only care about yourself. You are the definition of selfish.", "YTA you\u2019re not going to have to worry about your boyfriend getting along with your family. You\u2019ve shown him who you are and that\u2019s enough for him to second guess your relationship. Are you really that self centered that you couldn\u2019t include his friend for the holiday? You come across as heartless. Do you think your boyfriend will be comfortable and enjoy the holiday knowing his friend is alone? It could have been a great bonding experience to share together but you didn\u2019t want to share.", "NAH.\n\nI dont think you\u2019re an asshole but i do think you should rethink this. I think your bf is being inconsiderate but it depends on why he waited until the day before to ask if it was okay to bring his roommate. Sure, maybe it was poor planning. But maybe a flight got cancelled, maybe it was a money issue, maybe something got messed up with his leave.\n\nI get wanting meeting the family to be special. I get not feeling comfortable inviting the roommate over for a holiday. If I had suggested bringing a guest for the holidays my mom would have acted like I was committing a cardinal sin. My father would have been all for it. My father is a former marine. My ideal holidays will one day be a found family gathering, not necessarily just a blood family one.\n\nI think that how you respond to this will determine if your relationship continues. It seems important for your boyfriend to be able to include his roommate- especially since they\u2019re far from home this holiday season. I also understand you want this meeting to be special. A good compromise might be to invite the roommate for thanksgiving, but organize a dinner with your parents and boyfriend this weekend if you can so they can have some more \u201cone on one\u201d time.\n\nThe time to have the \u201cI need more than one days notice to invite people to family gatherings\u201d is a conversation that can wait until after this one day, I think. I\u2019m sure if you were somewhere unfamiliar you\u2019d be grateful to have somewhere to go for a holiday meal.\n\nInvite the roommate, have a nice dinner with your family, and /then/ have a chat with your boyfriend about notice for family events. I think this event will have a large impact on your relationship one way or the other.", "Growing up in a military town and married a military guy,  I knew my mom made enough to feed an army and drug strays home for Thanksgiving for years.\n\nOP, I get the first family meet is super important,  but a 19-22 y/o who is away from family on an important holiday, it would be a kind gesture to include them but not required. \n\nNYA But it wouldn't kill you to show some empathy.", "My first thought was that your BF was imposing.\n\nAnd yes, but his roommate is in the service. We're supposed to do a little more than just thank them for their service. \n\nYTA. \n\nIf you had problems with the roommate, I could see your stance, but he seems pretty neutral and is someone in the service away from home.", "I Don\u2019t understand all the YTA. Yes, thanksgiving is about coming together and being a community. Yet at the same time its also about family, which can be small and private. You are allowed to chose who you want at your dinner. Also it\u2019s the first thanksgiving op is bringing her SO to, that\u2019s a big deal. Her SO asking to bring a plus 1 isn\u2019t ok, even if his heart is in a good place. Nobody knows him, let alone nobody knows his plus 1. NTA NTA NTA", "NTA. If someone told me they were going to meet their girlfriend\u2019s family for the first time, there is no way I\u2019d even think about tagging along. Yeah it\u2019s kinda shitty to spend thanksgiving alone, but it\u2019s a holiday. It happens every year. Get some yummy takeout and watch a movie or something, it isn\u2019t THAT big a deal. \nI think the boyfriend is actually kind of shitty for even asking to be honest. If he hasn\u2019t met the parents in a year and a half of dating, clearly it\u2019s a pretty big deal for him to be doing so. OP already said she doesn\u2019t usually bring men home so this meeting is an important event in her life. For the friend, it would be a nice afternoon eating with some strangers and thinking \u201cthis is a nice family\u201d, for OP, it\u2019s possibly one of the biggest events in her life. It\u2019s the people she cares about the most in her life finally meeting. The boyfriend should understand this and shouldn\u2019t be making her feel guilty about wanting this moment to be special and not wanting some stranger there.", "This seems so odd honestly and i can\u2019t wrap my head around people saying you\u2019re the asshole. You\u2019re not an asshole for not wanting a stranger glued to your boyfriends hip the first time he meets your family, at an event you\u2019re not even hosting nonetheless. And not to mention the extremely rude fact of asking the night before which is inconsiderate to both you and your family hosting who would need to make sure there\u2019s enough room/food, but apparently that\u2019s okay to your boyfriend as long as his friend can come with him.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - you don\u2019t have any personal connection to this roommate. Also, military guys are used to doing unconventional things on the holidays. I doubt he\u2019ll mind either way.", "NAH, But, he's 34, you're 26, and he seems to be a lot more worried about his roommate's plans for Thanksgiving than you and your family. You're asking AITA about this because your instincts are telling you something is wrong here. Listen to your instincts! Most of the shit choices I've made my life happened because I ignored my instincts and hoped for better. And I'm 48. Please, learn this lesson sooner than I did.", "Instead of a soft YTA, I'm going to go with a HARD YTA, and here's why: he may not get another Thanksgiving. Ever. \n\nA lot of people, and I work for DoD for the military, severely underestimate the requirements that many who enlist put out there when they sign up. If he has a chance to have something, even if it's with his roommate, which does NOT surprise me since they're both military, then personally, the odd one out, is you. I never served, but it was my friends who did that stuck their necks out for me and gave me the opportunities of a lifetime and changed my life for the better. If they wanted Thanksgiving dinner at my house and wanted to bring people I didn't know, the door is open, the turkey will be on the table and I'll be ready to hand them a plate. \n\nI think there's a reason why Veterans' Day is in the same month as Thanksgiving.", "NTA. OP set reasonable boundaries, and I wouldn't want to bring a stranger along with a newly introduced significant other to family. \n\nIf anything, you guys can all have a Thanksgiving lunch together, then go to dinner as boyfriend and girlfriend.", "NAH\n\nYou're allowed to have boundaries and under most circumstances I'd agree especially given the first time meetings involved. \n\nBut you're leaving someone along on a holiday about being with people. Harsh but your prerogative\n\nMaybe compromise, hang out with him and his friend early in the day or the next day, show him you care!", "OP, you are NTA. This is a ridiculous ask on your boyfriend\u2019s part. \n\nOr, possibly, you\u2019re a character in a hallmark movie about to find out over an unbelievably awkward Thanksgiving dinner that the love of your life isn\u2019t your boyfriend, it\u2019s his best friend. If you meet a scrappy kid whose rough exterior just hides a need to share all the love they have to give in the next few days, it\u2019s probably that.", "NTA it\u2019s your family you can say no, it would be uncomfortable for everyone to have a complete stranger at an event where everyone knows each other. Plus he would probably stay by your boyfriend and prevent your bf from being able to connect with your family", "NAH.  You have a right to say no when a guest asks to be a guest.  That said, I don\u2019t like what you did and would find that choice incompatible with dating a person.  Compassion and generosity would be my preference in a partner.", "NTA you\u2019re doing introductions for the first time. My family is the kind that brings every loose stranger into our home for thanksgiving but I can\u2019t imagine trying to manage the stress of fielding the introduction between family and and a new partner and on top of that being in charge of the extra guest you don\u2019t really know. Any other year it would be fine to have the roommate come but this isn\u2019t any other year. Also, I can promise you there are others on base who aren\u2019t going home that roomie could team up with to have their own thanksgiving together.", "NTA, it's unreasonable for him to ask for some dude you barely know to come to your family Thanksgiving. Personally, I won't even invite close friends to Thanksgiving because I feel like it's a family holiday.\n\nMy guess is that he already told the dude he could come assuming you would say yes, and now he's frustrated/embarrassed.", "NTA - Irrelevant that it\u2019s thanksgiving, it\u2019s really about your family meeting him for the first time, he needs to be alone and he\u2019s kinda dumb or selfish for not understanding this.", "NAH \n\nI honestly don't understand all the You're The AH. \n\n1) This is the first time BF will be meeting BF. OP has said she's rarely brought a partner home.\n\n2) SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE ROOMMATE. \n\n3) BF chose to ask last minute.

Do you not go to his house, like ever?", "This right here, and like the fact that the people who are on his side as a military member are only basing on the argument that you should bend to his wants or you will lose the relationship is an indicator of the problem.

However, I do understand the military bond so I\u2019m going with NAH.", "The military point is entirely irrelevant here. BF is meeting OP's family for the first time.

If OP wants, she could pick another day for the BF to meet her family so that Thanksgiving isn't such a high pressure situation, but it sounds like they've been planning this Thanksgiving for a while, and the boyfriend asked to bring a friend at the last minute, just a day before the event.  It shows he doesn't appreciate what a big deal it is for her to bring a guy home to meet her family.\n\nNTA", "This is a ridiculous take. \n\n1. You don't invite strangers to someone else's event.

A few times people have tried to drag me along to their family's events, wouldn't take no for an answer and get really offended when I decline, since they already asked the hosts if I could come.

Even asking her parents is kinda rude, because it puts them on the spot, and they would feel obligated, but depending on how her parents normally feel about strangers at family parties, it could be (barely) acceptable. The only thing the boyfriend could do, within the bounds of good manners, would be to casually mention that the roommate would not have family to be with on Thanksgiving.  Not in a \"hinting for an invitation\" kind of way, but as part of another conversation.  IF OP then said, \"oh, my parents always LOVE having extras at Thanksgiving, why don't you ask him if he wants to come along?\", he'd be within bounds.  \n\nThis would be true even if they were actually brothers, or cousins or any other connection, so the fact that the boyfriend may consider the roommate \"family\" is irrelevant...guests don't invite their own guests.

She was acting kind of squirrelly, and as I pieced things together, I realized that when she was acting squirrelly, it usually meant she had a BF. \n\nI was pissed at her and it wound up be friendship-ending for three reasons: 1) There was no need for her to have lied to me; had she just told me that she was bringing the BF to meet the family and wanted it to just be the two of them with her family, I would have totally understood.  But she hadn't even introduced me to him, just told me stories about him that made him sound sketchy; 2) She lied to her mother and made me look flaky, and then she TOLD me she lied to her mother, but didn't tell me why; and 3) my mother had died two days prior to the previous Thanksgiving, and this kind of pulled the rug out from under me emotionally and left me with no plans and seemingly no support. \n\nSo with no plans, I wound up adopting a dog, who hung around for the next 18 years.", "I\u2019ve known family-oriented people who are protective of their family and wait until relationships get REALLY serious before introducing their partners to their family.

Like it\u2019s one dinner and one day out of the year again maybe it\u2019s because I know what it feels like but the more the merrier and it\u2019s not even that awkward because again there are a bunch of people there and OP even said her parents wouldn\u2019t feel weird about it but that she personally does which is extra fucked up to me. Also? How is this person supposed to be focused on making a good impression and doing all that shit when he\u2019s probably worried about someone he sees as a brother being depressed as fuck and alone", "Agreed she isn\u2019t being unreasonable about the first time meet.  However boyfriend/roommate are both military which anyone in the military will tell you makes them family.  No one says they can\u2019t go early and the roomie could meet a little later for dinner?  There are options if she is willing (because it sounds like the family wouldn\u2019t object, just her).  \n\nObviously it\u2019s her call but to not even consider advancing an invite to a man fighting for our country on the day we give thanks for it seems just so\u2026.wrong.", "Or he isn't seeing this as the big deal OP sees.  It's been 1.5 years.  Surely they could have met at other times so it would be just about them and not a holiday gathering.", "It\u2019s been 1.5 years and he\u2019s never met her family and she doesn\u2019t know his roommate/best friend and views them as a stranger - there\u2019s a lot of issues with this alone", "No clue, OP provided 0 info. For all we know the roommate just got back from a tour, just broke up with a spouse, recently moved to town, or any of\n100 other possible scenarios.", "But to the people who's house it is he's a rando. He's a guy who lives with thier daughter's new boyfriend whom they've never even met.", "\u201cOh big tough guy can\u2019t handle the holidays alone\u201d. What point do they even think they\u2019re making here lol ?!?", "Ohhh sorry, I just meant their wages are typically pretty low. It was a \u201cnothing\u201d like \u201cpractically nothing.\u201d I should\u2019ve been more clear!", "While unusual, a lot of families would open their doors to someone who doesn\u2019t have anywhere else to go for thanksgiving. That\u2019s not such an odd thing. I get that OP wanted this event to be about just her bf meeting her family for the first time, but if bf is that upset about his roommate then she can\u2019t really expect him to be in a cheery holiday mood at Thanksgiving dinner. It\u2019s one thing if OP asked and the host said no, it\u2019s another for OP to be saying no herself.", "In my family it\u2019s not unusual at all to have strangers at thanksgiving. If we know someone is going to be alone, we invite them along. I\u2019ve brought friends, coworkers, one time a recently re-housed individual who didn\u2019t have friends or family\u2026. I ask first if I\u2019m not hosting but to me Thanksgiving is all about sharing what you have. I mean, that\u2019s the goal; obvs not the reality practiced in it\u2019s conception. \n\nI understand that this day is important to OP and they don\u2019t want anything to \u2018derail\u2019, but my parents would be WAY more proud of me for bringing the roommate on that special day and recognizing that of allllllll the days in a year, this one is one of the tougher ones for someone to sit out alone. \n\nAlso - OP may not know roommate well, but her BF sure does. I get she deserves to be comfortable and have boundaries, but it seems to me the kinder choice would have to agree. And since this is AITA, I think I\u2019ll have to vote ESH. It\u2019s poop that BF asked at the last minute. It\u2019s poop that she said no without considering it much. It\u2019s poop that someone is gonna be alone on T-day. It\u2019s poop that this will probably end the relationship :(", "So weird, what is wrong with all these people? I'm pretty sure they're all the types to deprioritize their partners compared to all the other important relationships in their lives.", "Maybe she's worried about how he'll act/ if her family will like him. And if he doesn't get along with her family, that will reflect badly on the boyfriend.\n\nMy family has always had an open door policy for holidays. Anyone we know who would be alone, is more than welcome. Until that guy......\n\nHe constantly shared his racist opinions, we're open minded and mixed races. He was very fat shaming, we're all sizes from underweight to obese. He's from a very narrow minded religious background. We're mostly atheist. It was horrible.", "Are you kidding? There's going to be all kinds of scrutiny on him as the boyfriend.  \n\nHaving the roommate there might actually dispel some of that, but only if she knew him well enough to know that he was good company.  But he's a stranger to her.", "It just seems so odd? He's never met her family but wants to invite some ther dude they don't know to thier house? I guess if it's a big neighborhood type of party, but if it's just family + op's boyfriend then it's wierd to try and shoe horn in another random guy who they never would have invited.", "I've had many thanksgivings alone and I completely disagree with what you're saying. The bf needs to prioritize his gf's feelings and his relationship here. This is a massive relationship milestone. Should the roommate have come to the first date, should he be there for the engagement, maybe eventually in the delivery room?\n\nEdit: alone*, not along", "I agree here, probably because I view Thanksgiving as a time that's for both family and friends and truly a time to be thankful for what you have and to share when you can. My family will always invite those who don't have somewhere to go, especially friends who couldn't make it home. Spirit of the holiday and honestly can't imagine feeling good about leaving a friend alone. I get OP has built this meeting up because it's the first but it would greatly disappoint me if my partner felt as she does.", "Old lady, here. If I were the boyfriend, I would break-up with her. If she is this selfish now, imagine their marriage-her way or the highway, with no compassion for anyone else. I would also make my apologies and skip the dinner and have pizza with my roommate. \n\nIf it were an ordinary day, I doubt that the roommate would mind spending it alone. Thanksgiving is a family day, it\u2019s a day that is meant to be shared. The roommate can\u2019t get to his family, but because having an extra at dinner ruins her plans of who should share that day, she is showing that she is very self-centered.", "If they're family then he should have introduced the roommate to the gf before inviting him to thanksgiving! Come on people this isn't that complicated.", "She said he's military so it's possible they were long distance", "That still doesn't make it a small ask, but that's all beside the point anyway. The boyfriend knows how important this introduction is to her and is trying to bring along an emotional support bro because he's getting cold feet at the last minute. He should show up for her without distraction at this big moment in their relationship.", "Everyone isn\u2019t \u201ca hive\u201d just because most people disagree with you.", "This right here, like I really want her to dig into this.", "I get that lots of families would do that, but I\u2019m talking about OP\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s thought process.", "My family would absolutely welcome the friend, especially if he was alone on Thxgiving. My mom feeds home repairmen and sends homemade rolls with our UPS driver around the holidays. We have a more-the-merrier mentality.", "If it were my daughter, I\u2019d be extremely disappointed she didn\u2019t ask and invite him. To knowingly leave someone alone on a holiday is not something I\u2019d be proud of. She even says her parents would definitely say yes. It\u2019s like she\u2019s worried the friend will steal the thunder or something.", "I can easily see myself in the position of the bfs roommate, and I would be absolutely mortified if my roommate wanted to take me along, not to his families thanksgiving but the thanksgiving of his gfs family who he has never met", "It's odd as heck and completely disregards OP's feelings", "It\u2019s not odd if you\u2019ve been in the military. I get why it\u2019s odd to civilians though. We frequently end up bringing a buddy along if we have family and that person doesn\u2019t, specially during special occasions like these. \nThat said, I get why she isn\u2019t comfortable. She doesn\u2019t know the guy.", "I\u2019d agree if it was a random family get together but it\u2019s Thanksgiving and as many people have pointed out being in the military and being alone on holidays can be pretty heavy. OPs bf feels for his friend so he\u2019s working through that and having to tell him he\u2019ll be alone. OP is not wrong for her feelings but she said herself her family would have said yes.\n\nIt\u2019s also not a random guy, it\u2019s his roommate. She doesn\u2019t have anything negative to say about him she just doesn\u2019t know him well which can be resolved by spending more time around him. She needs the day to only be about her relationship and family. Understandable enough, but guarantee bf isn\u2019t going to be as \u201cthankful\u201d as she\u2019d want knowing his roommate/military brother is alone.", "I assumed thanksgiving was different\u2026like people all alone are generally welcomed somewhere. I\u2019m not American so this is an impression.", "I have an open house in general, but ESPECIALLY on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  \n\nI think I was like 7 maybe and my uncle's best friend came over for Christmas.  I asked my mom why he was there (even tho I loved him) because he wasn't family.  And she told me holidays are about friends and family and that he couldn't be with his bio family so he was celebrating with us. And besides that he WAS family and no one should have to be alone if they don't have to be and that's what we do for people.   \n\nI'm paraphrasing because I dont remember her exact words but I 100% remember having that conversation in my great grandmother's living room.\n\nIf my girlfriend waa like hey babe my friend is gonna be alone can she come? I'd instantly say yes, and then I'd just tell my mom we have an extra person coming cuz she can't be with her family. And she's be like okay cool, grab an extra bottle lol.  \n\nYou don't have to be that way, but I am and I'd like something close to that in return.", "Yeah I'm getting downvotes but whatever I'll die on that hill.\n\nI went to Thanksgiving with my ex once and it was at her aunt's place and said my cousin couldn't come.  So my cousin just sat alone at my place watching TV and are checkers.  \n\nThe entire time I was there I couldn't enjoy myself cuz j felt so guilty. I also so no real reason why he couldn't have attended while I was there.  This was like 10 years ago and I still remember it vividly.", "No excuse though I\u2019ve done long distance and I\u2019m also a military kid - there\u2019s a thing called video chats that has been around for years and with Covid (as they got together during Covid) there\u2019s so many virtual things they could have done.\n\nEdit note: when I dated anyone long distance I had them meet my best friends within the first month and interacted with them regularly. The fact that they don\u2019t know either family for friends/roommates in any form and are considered strangers is a big flag for me.", "If they are both military and roommates, and BF's roommate can't see his family for the holidays, pretty sure I can see the thought process. BF is worried about his friend. Lots of service members cut off from family and stuck in the barracks get *really* bad around the holidays. Especially since the workload gets pretty hectic. (They force you to go to two or three \"fun days\" a week, but you have to get the same amount of work done as a regular week. In half the time with usually half the people.)\n\nBF is probably worried his boy will either a) get way too drunk and do something stupid or b) intentionally hurt himself. Also might not want to come out and say this because it looks and sounds bad. \"I'm not ok, but I will be\" is a phrase you hear all the time. It usually translates to \"I am terrified or extremely hurt, but I'm gonna complete the mission.\"\n\nThis is sort of a NAH in this particular situation, because bf has the right to ask, op has right to say no. Also sort of ESH because there's probably a lot more going on that isn't going to be talked about because it's too uncomfortable, but absolutely needs to be talked about when everyone can handle doing so.", "This is how my family is and I don\u2019t understand most of these comments. It\u2019s thanksgiving!!  This would seriously make me question this relationship. If you can\u2019t trust my close friends what does that say about your real opinion of me?  You meet them and they do something I\u2019ll cut them off but making someone close to your partner spend thanksgiving alone is heartless.", "Yeah that\u2019s kind of a strange thing to be worried about. She\u2019s worried that the friend will get all the attention instead of her bringing home a serious boyfriend?", "At the same time if I was the bf and my close friend was about to spend thanksgiving alone I\u2019d be heartbroken and (ask permission then) make him come.", "It\u2019s not really odd at all. Honestly if I was the BF I\u2019d be more likely to cancel so my buddy isn\u2019t alone.", "Totally understand bringing them to your own family's thanksgiving/holiday/party whatever. What is weird is that BF hasn't met OP's family yet, and OP doesn't know the roommate. This whole situation is weird to me. \n\nI have brought random friends, occasional BF for Thanksgiving myself. I never would ask or bring my best friend or siblings first time I met my husband's family. My family's, sure.", "Spending more time with him...before tomorrow? BF sprung thus on her at the very last minute. It's also not his event to randomly invite another person to. It's just rude to ask to bring a +1 when you don't know anyone and you're already a +1.\n\nI also don't understand why the BF is 'working through having to tell him' anything? If he didn't have plans this weekend wouldn't he already be expecting to be on his own? Did he just expect to be invited to his roommate's new girlfriend's parents house for the holidays?", "I think it's a household to household thing. Some people grow up in households that aren't as open to other people coming around. I've been to my friends get togethers for holidays, and I would have never invited someone else that they didn't know. (But that may have been the vibe their family gave off). My dad welcomed everyone to our house, so I wouldn't mind if it was my own families.", "Usually that IS how it goes because that IS what thanksgiving is really about; being thankful for what you have, however/whatever it may be and sharing it with those you care about and those who can\u2019t be with their loved ones.", "Great but this is a massive relationship milestone that happens to fall on a holiday. This isn't any normal thanksgiving. It's a special one. Your rules don't apply and he's basically telling OP that his roommate's feelings matter more than hers. Yikes.", "I love that for you guys. My dad didn't care if our friends were over whenever, and I also spent a lot of holidays at some of my friends families. I personally plan on having an open house to my son's friends when they're older. It's awesome to be that welcoming BUT I also can understand why OP would only want it to be her BF while he's meeting her family for the first time. I would think that the BF would be preoccupied trying to keep his friend comfortable that he wouldn't be as into conversations with her family (but I could be assuming wrong) It might turn into him and his friends hanging out as the new comers instead of him being there with OP. NAH, her BF is allowed to ask, and OP is allowed to say no. IMO", "When you say military kid do you mean you\u2019ve served or your family was military?", "Thank goodness I am seeing these comments. I am so confused by most of the other comments who would not accept this friend for dinner. I couldn't imagine turning down a request like that and I certainly wouldn't date someone who would.", "They\u2019re in the military they can\u2019t exactly plan out flights home months in advance. They often don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll get leave until the week of. Those are important details to why YTA", "My dad served not myself personally but I\u2019ve been close friends with and known military people from most of the branches my whole life and even briefly dated some and I\u2019ve also had long distance relationships with non military so I\u2019m also speaking from experience in a variety of forms."]}
