Tomorrow, he\u2019s coming to Thanksgiving dinner at my dad\u2019s house and meeting my family for the first time. I\u2019m extremely family oriented and it\u2019s so important to me that he\u2019s finally meeting them. This also means the world to my family because I rarely bring men home and they\u2019ve been wanting to meet him for a long time. He\u2019s aware of this and how much this meeting means to me and has assured me that he\u2019s looking forward to it too. \n\nThis afternoon, he asked if his roommate could come too. I was caught off guard and said no. I didn\u2019t even ask my family who I\u2019m sure would say yes, but it\u2019s a hard boundary for me. I barely know his roommate but he\u2019s military and will not be able to be with his own family for the holiday, which is why my boyfriend asked. I understand and appreciate his compassion and kindness but I need this event to be just him, me, and my family without his buddy who is a stranger to me. I called him to talk through it, but he\u2019s extremely upset and wasn\u2019t really responding. I asked if he\u2019s still coming and he said yes. Then, I asked if he\u2019s okay and he said no but that he will be. I told him to reach out to me when he\u2019s ready and that I understand if he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me right now so I haven\u2019t heard from him since the phone call a couple hours ago. I feel like a massive asshole but this is one of the rare events where I\u2019ve put my foot down in this relationship and refused to accommodate his wants.

You are clear what you want this visit to be about so I think your SO should try to understand that.", "NAH. You're allowed to set whatever boundaries you want, but don't be surprised if, after thinking it over, he decides it's a dealbreaker. People in the military together often become family to each other, so from his POV, you basically told him he has to leave a brother alone because your heart isn't big enough to include him. He'll probably honor his commitment to your family to attend, but I'll be very surprised if the relationship lasts past this weekend.", "INFO: The last line of your post about finally putting your foot down and not accommodating this one request or something to that nature seems odd.

If he's not deployed or on a military base, but is instead living in a private apartment as your boyfriend's roommate whey can't he enjoy Thanksgiving with his family?\n\nAnd why did he just ask this on Wednesday afternoon, after people have already planned the number of dinner guests, bought the food, etc.?", "INFO: why hasn\u2019t your bf met your family previously?

I personally think it would\u2019ve been good to see the bf interact with people he just met along with someone he is comfortable with.

Bf isn't wrong to want to make sure his roommate has somewhere to go for the holiday, but maybe meeting your parents for the first time isn't the best time to bring a friend.", "NAH.\n\nI think this is a situation in which you really need to consider military culture. \n\nIn a \u201cworld\u201d in which so many people can\u2019t be with extended family for holidays, it\u2019s customary for military personnel/families to invite others to join their own celebrations. It\u2019s very possible that your boyfriend found out his roommate has nowhere to go on Thanksgiving and wants to extend the invitation to join you according to custom. (It\u2019s also extremely possible that the Chain of Command has \u201cstrongly suggested\u201d that those with plans include their less fortunate comrades.)\n\nI understand why you\u2019d feel more comfortable not including the roommate. You\u2019re NTA for that. But your boyfriend is also NTA for being deeply disappointed that you\u2019re unwilling to budge on this.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the bond of those who serve together. It runs deep \u2014 especially if they\u2019ve seen combat together. Not every military spouse or significant other has to go \u201call in,\u201d but I\u2019d caution you to think about how you\u2019ll handle certain aspects of military life as a team \u2014 especially if things continue to progress.\n\nGood luck.\n\n(Note: I actually met my husband because of the \u201cleave no battle buddy behind\u201d mentality. His company had recently returned from a deployment, and a friend from college had a date with his roommate. At the last minute, his roommate found out he had no plans and refused to go on the date unless my friend found a date for him. One phone call later, enter me. We\u2019ve been married for 15 years \u2014 7 during which my husband was active duty and which included 3 year-plus deployments.

Because EVERYONE would be shocked and saddened. So you will fake it tomorrow. And not bring it up. Sure hope nobody asks your boyfriend. That will get awkward very fast.\n\nHardly the good impression you were hoping for.", "I get why it's not ideal for you, but isn't the whole point of Thanksgiving about being generous and welcoming? \n\nIt's a romanticized and probably untrue version of history, but according to tradition, on the first Thanksgiving the American Indians, who probably weren't thrilled about having the Pilgrims as their new neighbors, nonetheless shared their bounty with them as a gesture of goodwill.

Your bf may feel just as strongly, however, and he may see his roommate as family and he feels bad leaving him alone for the holiday.  This alone may put a taint on the picture perfect day you are trying to create and may be a sticking point that comes up later in your relationship.  \n\nSince, if I were in the same spot, I wouldn't hesitate to bring the roommate along, I don't have any appropriate advice to give you other then to caution you that this may bring blowback into your relationship in the future, so tread wisely!", "NTA.

The last minute request to bring him along with the fact that he\u2019s never met the family is a big deal. If it was his family or he\u2019d actually met them before it would be another deal but OP is being perfectly reasonable. Also if they live a drive away why not just come back to BF\u2019s place for drinks or desserts  or go to the bar together?

I'm the type to fall back on that mentality too, keep strangers out but there is a speciallness about holidays that does in some minute way bring people together. It also may be less stressful for the BF having someone around on \"his side\" so to speak, I'm sure you're family is fine people but I'd wager he may have some anxiety about the situation.", "YTA.

I have to say something because this rings alarm bells in my head. Please don't be guilted when you stand up for yourself. Sacrificing yourself for someone else's wants only ends in tears.

Proceed with at least some caution, and pay attention to his reaction any time you say \"no\" in future.", "NTA, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this causes a big problem in your relationship.

I think it's worth considering what this says about you to your fianc\u00e9 though. It would strike me as pretty cold blooded and it would make me second guess the relationship.

I think it would probably be good for his roommate to come with him, they\u2019ll be able to keep each other company when your family inevitably talks about things they aren\u2019t a part of.

I'd normally say NTA, but your boyfriend is the closest thing that guy has to family right now. Set your hard boundary, but maybe agree to a small special dinner at your boyfriends to include the roommate. It would allow for you to meet the roommate and for him to have a special meal that you all can make and enjoy together, but it wouldn't overstep the boundary you're making around your family.", "NTA for now because there is a very simple follow up conversation to have...ARE THERE ANY OTHER FRIENDS ON BASE THAT HE COULD REACH OUT TO?

Tomorrow, he\u2019s coming to Thanksgiving dinner at my dad\u2019s house and meeting my family for the first time. I\u2019m extremely family oriented and it\u2019s so important to me that he\u2019s finally meeting them. This also means the world to my family because I rarely bring men home and they\u2019ve been wanting to meet him for a long time. He\u2019s aware of this and how much this meeting means to me and has assured me that he\u2019s looking forward to it too. \n\nThis afternoon, he asked if his roommate could come too. I was caught off guard and said no. I didn\u2019t even ask my family who I\u2019m sure would say yes, but it\u2019s a hard boundary for me. I barely know his roommate but he\u2019s military and will not be able to be with his own family for the holiday, which is why my boyfriend asked. I understand and appreciate his compassion and kindness but I need this event to be just him, me, and my family without his buddy who is a stranger to me. I called him to talk through it, but he\u2019s extremely upset and wasn\u2019t really responding. I asked if he\u2019s still coming and he said yes. Then, I asked if he\u2019s okay and he said no but that he will be. I told him to reach out to me when he\u2019s ready and that I understand if he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me right now so I haven\u2019t heard from him since the phone call a couple hours ago.

I never want anyone to be alone on holidays or days of observance. \n\nMy thought was he military and living away from family or his normal home base. My sister is in some country almost every holiday and is usually invited by locals to celebrate. I would extend the same offer if put in that situation.", "Agreed\u2014 I find it so sad this \u201cthe magic of gratitude and pilgrims being saved from starvation by the indigenous people they were slaughtering\u2014 ew, I don\u2019t want it wrecked by some stranger at the table!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s sad that so many Americans only have a family dinner once or twice a year and there\u2019s always a ton of these \u201cew\u2014 it was ruined because some stranger was there!\u201d", "I mean, if he's near the base, he could go to the mess hall and be with other service members. All during my youth my Dad would collect the singles in his unit and bring them to our house for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter or any major holiday. Those young men were far from home, most for the first time, and appreciated the welcome. It's ultimately OP's choice as to what she is comfortable with, but I don't see why a little grace and compassion couldn't be extended.", "The day before does not count, that is absolutely without warning.", "Wtf are you talking about? Devaluing feelings because they\u2019re men? He asked if his roommate could come for dinner and she said no. That\u2019s not a big feeling hurting issue. \n\nIf he asked her to move in together or proposed marriage and she said no, okay, he got his feelings hurt and needs time to regroup. She said his buddy can\u2019t come for Thanksgiving dinner. I can\u2019t imagine a reality where that is a big deal. There\u2019s no reason his feelings should be hurt but he\u2019s acting like a big baby about it. My opinion would be the same whatever their genders were.", "If you were invited to the holiday of a family you didn't know, would you invite a stranger?  And, if so, would you get upset at the person who didn't automatically say yes?  \n\nIt's a fine ask if you already have an established relationship with the family hosting, but otherwise, it's pretty strange.", "Even more of a reason.  It's a huge holiday dinner where he's meeting her family for the first time.  Again, even if he asked, getting upset is crappy.", "I guess, but it\u2019s also her family and she should be able to choose who she introduces them to, no? Like is OP not allowed to choose who she takes to her family home for thanksgiving, or want the first time she brings her bf home to be an intimate event?\n\nI get her bf is upset and he can be, but I still don\u2019t think she\u2019s in the wrong for it \u00af\\(\u30c4)/\u00af", "It is a bit weird but also not that weird. I had a friend of my gf , who I hardly knew, join our Christmass dinner (which admittedly is 20+ people), because she couldn't go home (foreigner student). \n\nShe was happy to be there and I'm glad she didn't have to be home alone\n\nBut I also understand  that the smaller the dinner, the bigger the ask and if this is the first time you are introducing your bf it is more awkward.\n\nSo I'd agree with NAH (although you could say N T A, because your bf should also try to understand and accept your viewpoint)", "She even says her family would say yes, she\u2019s the only one stopping it", "I would hold resentment if my roommate was home alone and my girl said no without even asking her parents.  Honestly, that's not the kind of heart I desire in a mate.", "It's \"normal\" for some people, not normal for everyone. In your case, your own partner is military, so that's what you do. It's perfectly fine \\*not\\* to do this, too.", "I don\u2019t think the YTA or having the hospitality to include someone who is unable to be with family should be \u201conly because of the military thing\u201d. It should include anyone who is unable to be with their family for any reason (other than said person being an AH who isn\u2019t welcome at family events). Whether it\u2019s \u201cmy buddy is in the military and couldn\u2019t get leave\u201d or \u201cmy buddy lives here for work/school and wasn\u2019t able to go home because money/weather/work\u201d, it should be a courtesy to include them.", "I asked my husband (military) what he would have done if I hadn't allowed a \"roommate\" to come for Thanksgiving. He told me he wouldn't have come either... and would have been rethinking our relationship. That's the sentiment of everyone I know in the service (minus maybe 2). I can't even tell you how many random battles came to events throughout the years. I hope OP rethinks it.", "Hmm. I guess people just have different comfort levels with that. I wouldn\u2019t mind as long as the BF could vouch he was a good guy. Appreciate the explanation though, perhaps OP feels more similarly to you. I\u2019m guessing her boyfriend has a perspective closer to mine so didn\u2019t see his ask as a big deal. I do think there are a lot of people who are very willing to go the extra mile for servicemen at the holidays so he was probably surprised his request wasn\u2019t well received.", "It's Thanksgiving, ffs...", "It\u2019s not an AH mindset. This is the first time her family is meeting her bf, and his roommate is a stranger to her.", "You're selling her reason short by saying it doesn't exist. She's introducing her long term boyfriend to her family for the first time and doesn't want the distraction of a rando. I could speculate that he's trying to hide behind his bro because he's nervous, but that doesn't even matter - he knows how important it is to her and should respect that.", "I agree, I'm having 12 people over for Thanksgiving tomorrow, and I'm not going home. None of them are family, some are close friends and some are more distant or I don't know them well. I've spent the last couple weeks making sure that anyone in my class who isn't going home has somewhere to go. I'm so grateful to have people to share the holidays with. I've had friends say over the last few days, \"Oh by the way, I invited X.\" My answer is great, make sure they know what time to come and what my address is. We'll have traditional and international food, because no everyone cooks American food. It will be wonderful. As long as someone knows everyone who is coming (I don't invite complete strangers) they are welcome to come. I've invited partners, siblings, and friends of friends. \n\nI've been privileged to host this type of Thanksgiving celebration a few times, and it's so much fun to hear about everyone's traditions, introduce them to mine, and try the food that everyone loves most. The number of people in my home for Thanksgiving has expanded over the years, and I love it. \n\nMy own family of origin is more similar to what it sounds like OP's thinking is. Holidays tend to be more exclusive, with long-term partners being included, but not really inviting friends who might not be able to be with their own families for some reason. I tend to prefer my holidays now. They're less stressful, even though I'm taking on more work. I'll get to hear about what everyone is grateful for, not exactly an original tradition, but not one that we practiced in my family of origin. I can see the argument for both sides, and I've experienced both ways, neither is necessarily wrong, but I know which holidays I prefer. Since I'm not going home for Christmas I'm hoping that one of my friend's families will adopt me this year, but if not, I'll spend a quiet day at home or team up with friends again.", "When my husband and I were in the Navy this is what we would do.  We couldn't invite everyone who was alone, but we tried to include the most we could.  It sucks being away from home and family.  It's the compassionate thing to do.  YTA.", "I mean when people just bring someone to a party or event without asking, then it\u2019s awkward. At least he asked.", ">What irks me is that he\u2019s now acting all hurt and refusing to talk to you...\n\nThat is literally devaluing.", "So this man wants to have a brother with him when he heads to one of the most nerve-wracking encounters of his-life, meeting the girlfriend's parents for the first time, and you're writing it off as \"his buddy can't come for Thanksgiving dinner\", and calling him a big baby. I don't see how much more devaluing you could be.", "Well, I\u2019m not in the service, but if I for some reason had some service member friend who I\u2019d just found out would be alone, I might ask if the host was open to it, but definitely not be pouty if they said no, I agree that\u2019s very rude. I probably also wouldn\u2019t ask for just anyone, but I guess I thought the rules were a little different for servicemen?! Since they\u2019re serving their country getting paid nothing and away from their families and all. But, I might be a bit old fashioned and based on the rest of these comments, I\u2019m thinking maybe things have shifted and this really isn\u2019t the vibe anymore?", "Yeah, all that traditional part about reaching out to strangers far from home and sharing a meal with them is for the birds anyway. . .", "It\u2019s called being kind. It\u2019s super selfish to only thing about yourself and not wanting to include someone with your family when OP said she\u2019s sure her family will be fine with him coming!!!!!!!", "Yes. But this is one dinner because the roommate cannot go home. It\u2019s being kind and doing something nice. Being selfless.\nDon\u2019t expect people to be nice to you if you can\u2019t be nice to them.", "Generally under normal circumstances yes, but this is the first time he\u2019s meeting her family and seems like she hasn\u2019t met the roommate or at least doesn\u2019t know him well. OP isn\u2019t being unreasonable by wanting this day to be about the two of them meeting her family for the first time.", "Thank you! Many people are calling her heartless but it\u2019s literally a holiday to celebrate w loved ones. Not to mention a moment for her family to finally meet her partner after almost 2 years. \n\nWhy would the boyfriend think it\u2019s okay to impose on that so last minute?", "Her partner is military. That guy could be her partner in a few years when he's stationed elsewhere. It's just sad.", "OPs BF is military. That\u2019s the point. It\u2019s normal for people in the military and their families. If she wants to consider this person her family then she needs to recognize that because he is military there are things that come with that. Like not letting one of your team mates/shipmates whatever you wanna call them be alone for the holidays.", "It's not a BYOB house party, it's Thanksgiving dinner. The shopping and likely some of the cooking has already been done. Adding another place setting is not a trivial ask, especially not for a stranger.", "Do you sincerely believe that not getting what one wants is always a valid reason for hurt feelings? Maybe you\u2019re right\u2026 I don\u2019t think so, but maybe I\u2019m wrong. \n\nRegardless, it has nothing to do with gender as suggested, and everything to do with the triviality of the issue. Seems like a temper tantrum to me but maybe I\u2019m just not as sensitive as other people.", "If he can\u2019t handle meeting the parents without a friend to hold his hand, maybe he isn\u2019t ready for an adult relationship? \n\nI think the issue here is that I don\u2019t attribute that much significance to a dinner, even a holiday dinner. The comments I\u2019m getting suggest that many other people think it\u2019s a bigger deal than I do. I sincerely just feel like it\u2019s dinner. Not intending to offend, upset, or trigger anyone.", "Serviceman do get paid? Idk where you heard that they're unpaid.", "Look, I get it. Had I been in the situation,  I probably would have invited him because idc about my family meeting my partner for the first time under certain conditions. But that\u2019s me. Everyone has their own opinion in this scenario, I just think it\u2019s a bit unfair for OP to not be able to say who she does or does not want to be present for a family event. Would it have been the kind thing to do, yes. Is she an AH for not doing it? In my opinion, no.", "I understand the circumstance but if the situation was reversed, I wouldn't say no.    \n\nAnd I'm not saying id break up with her, but I'd remember the moment.  And I wouldn't look favorably on it.", "yeah, but look at all those downvotes! Lots of arbiters of what Thanksgiving should be in these comments.", "In which case presumably over time she\u2019d get used to the idea and start inviting some people rather than just being thrown in at the deep end, with one day of warning, on an occasion that\u2019s obviously important to her (and probably already has her nervous).", "Sure, that's probably true. But if that's an expectation for being in a serious relationship with this guy, I'd think it would be on him to actually tell her that at any point over the past year and a half, rather than asking for an invitation to a stranger (to her) the day before a holiday.", "Every thanksgiving dinner has leftovers. Meaning enough food for everyone and more. One person isn\u2019t going to make it hard. \n\nAlso OP said she was sure her parents would say yes to him coming too.", "No, I think he is hurt because he cares about his friend who is going to be alone for Thanksgiving, and he thought he had a way to help him but was turned down.\n\nExactly what kind of spoiled monsters do you think men are? FFS...", "Yeah I feel like you don't put much significance to empathy or positive human interaction either. Some people are just built different. To each their own.", "I guess it's not common for other people, but I feel like there's an unspoken rule that if you're invited somewhere by someone you don't go inviting other people (especially people that aren't associated with whoever you're going with). I get not wanting to leave a friend at home, but if my friend was going to meet their SO family for the first time I would turn down the invite.", "I honestly learned to accept that everyone here is like a hive. Or think it\u2019s easily black or white. \n\nThere were various points in this post that raised some warning bells for me\n\nBut the holidays, I understand that it\u2019s about celebrating family/love or whatever. But not everyone is comfortable w having complete strangers in their home. Nor should they be forced to", "I\u2019d like to know if the OP\u2019s partner waited until the last minute to invite his friend.", ">thrown in at the deep end\n\nDo you think this is the Thunder Dome? It's one guy coming to dinner at her parent's house. I'm just saying it makes me sad thinking about it from her husband's perspective. My dad was military and the brotherhood is real. It's hard to see your brother turned away at the holidays, especially since you know it could be you next year.", "Agree the communication should have been better but it\u2019s a two way street. The military is probably a huge part of his life. I find it difficult that after all this time she doesn\u2019t understand something pretty fundamental of the culture.", "Oh my god, it has nothing to do with being a man. I think you\u2019re projecting a bit here because we could be talking about a man or woman and my opinion would be the same.

And even if maybe someday, assuming she stays with the BF, she\u2019d be more ready to do things like this, it\u2019s unfair to treat her as if she\u2019s somehow deficient and could never be part of the military culture because she\u2019s not up for this just after dating someone for a year and a half, and taking it slow enough that her family is just now meeting him.\n\nEdit: ask, not ass. Also pretty sure the start of my comment was eaten.", "So not only are you insanely biased, but lack any real emotional reasoning... yet he is the problem. K.", "How am I insanely biased or lacking in emotional reasoning? But actually don\u2019t answer that because I don\u2019t care.
