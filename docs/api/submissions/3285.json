This will likely not be temporary. Of course your family is going to pressure you because, in all reality, they don\u2019t want her living with them either. If what you\u2019re saying about your mom is true, I wouldn\u2019t allow her to stay either.", "Nta you are estranged for a reason.", "Nta. If they call and start bugging you about it just ask them if this is the purpose of the call. When it\u2019s an inevitable yes, just hang up.", "NTA\n\nAnd letting someone move in \u201ctemporarily\u201d rarely ends up that way and then you have to formally evict them.", "NTA. Ask each family member if they plan to reimburse you for housing costs. When they say no, play the uno reverse cars and point out that theyre the reason your mom cant live with you.", "NTA. Don't do it bruh there is only downsides to letting her stay with you. They're probably putting the pressure on you cause they're assuming your the one who would crack and say yes. I'm guessing they know how much of an asshole she is which is why none of them are taking her in. Don't. Let. Her. Stay.", "NTA\n\nKeep on telling them they\u2019ll have to take mom in. Do not give in.", "NTA Also, no is a complete sentence. They see every reason you offer and every conversation you entertain is just another opportunity for them to change your mind. Just tell them, \u201cas I told you before, I will not be letting her move in.\u201d then end the conversation of if they persist.", "NTA.\n\nYou have to protect you and *your* family from your **estranged** mother.\n\n> When my family calls or texts to pressure me to let her live here, I encourage them to let her live with them, but they always have excuses\n\nObviously no one in the family wants to take mom in. \n\n\nSister has the same living situation (husband and two kids), and claims she doesn't have room and lives too far away.\n\nThis isn't OP's problem.", "NTA - It\u2019s time to start blocking the family members that are harassing you.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t give in if that\u2019s really how you feel. Your home is the only place to get away from everything else. It should be a positive, welcoming place for you. Having negativity in your space is draining.", "NTA. Next time they bring it up, gently tell them you\u2019re not interested in unsolicited advice.", "NTA. \u201cTemporary\u201d stays have a tendency to be anything but. Also, if the rest of the family don\u2019t want her, then you don\u2019t want her either. I suspect that her difficulty finding a place to live is the consequence of being \u201cbitter, petty, intolerable\u201d her whole life. \n\nStay firm. If she really is as bad as you say, you do *not* want to subject your children to this person on a daily basis! You cannot image the harm this will do to them. Your sister already realizes this, which is why she is trying to foist her off on you.", "NTA - Stand your ground. If she moves in, she will never move out.", "NTA!  Stand your ground. Peace in your home is what matters. I think it's amazing you are drawing that boundary !", "NTA. She's a grown woman, she needs to figure it out and since your family members are so invested in trying to force her on you, they should have the time to find alternative living arrangements for her.", "NTA-other family members could make it work, its just easier to pawn her off on you. Stand your ground.", "NTA. Announce that you will block anyone who asks again. And do it, if one of them brings it up again.", "NTA. Tell your family one last time that you will not be housing your mother and are done with the conversation. Stop replying to them and, whatever you do, if your mother actually just shows up at your door, do not let her in.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let \u201cfamily\u201d bully you. There\u2019s a reason shelters exist.", "N T A.  It is fine to tell your family that asks your final answer is no and that if they cannot accept your decision or, at minimal, stop bringing it up that you will have no choice but to cut contact with them until they can as you need to put your, your SO and children wellbeing first.\n\nAlso, if you are in the USA, her living with you even a short time often gives her automatic tenant rights.  You don't want that problem", "NTA. Seems like 4 people in one house is the max allowed (according to your sister) so your house is maxed out too!!
