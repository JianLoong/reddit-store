This will likely not be temporary. Of course your family is going to pressure you because, in all reality, they don\u2019t want her living with them either.

If they call and start bugging you about it just ask them if this is the purpose of the call. When it\u2019s an inevitable yes, just hang up.", "NTA\n\nAnd letting someone move in \u201ctemporarily\u201d rarely ends up that way and then you have to formally evict them.", "NTA. Ask each family member if they plan to reimburse you for housing costs. When they say no, play the uno reverse cars and point out that theyre the reason your mom cant live with you.", "NTA. Don't do it bruh there is only downsides to letting her stay with you. They're probably putting the pressure on you cause they're assuming your the one who would crack and say yes. I'm guessing they know how much of an asshole she is which is why none of them are taking her in. Don't. Let. Her. Stay.", "NTA\n\nKeep on telling them they\u2019ll have to take mom in. Do not give in.", "NTA Also, no is a complete sentence. They see every reason you offer and every conversation you entertain is just another opportunity for them to change your mind.

Next time they bring it up, gently tell them you\u2019re not interested in unsolicited advice.", "NTA. \u201cTemporary\u201d stays have a tendency to be anything but. Also, if the rest of the family don\u2019t want her, then you don\u2019t want her either.

If she really is as bad as you say, you do *not* want to subject your children to this person on a daily basis! You cannot image the harm this will do to them.

Asking for reasons is just trying to find ways of convincing or coercing me. Man, this fucking family is a piece of work.", "NTA. Stick to your boundary. As you say, the rest of the family are making excuses. Tell them to FIND a way to make it work if they're that worried about her.", "NTA. Sounds like you're not the only one who has issues with your mom's behaviour. *Of course* they all have excuses to not take the unpleasant, intolerant woman in. Of course. \n\nAt any rate, as mentioned elsewhere, not your circus, not your monkeys. Skip the arguments and simply keep repeating that you will not be taking her in.

Strange excuse of your sister.  She lives too far away from what?  If your mom lives with her there is no distance at all.", "NTA\n\nStick to your guns, and don't allow anyone to pressure you into it.\n\nMy advice is that when they start pressuring you, simply tell them that if they once again suggest, or try to talk you into it, you will be blocking them, and no longer willing to talk to them. It is not right that you should sacrifice when they won't do it themselves. \n\nAnd if it is such a dire situation, then they should make that room for her first and foremost, before they even consider asking you to do it yourself.", "Anything but temporary.", "NTA. Time to block and go no contact", "NTA. You have the same excuse as your sister- a spouse and 2 kids, no room. Why is she entitled to refuse and not you?  \n\nIf you have the money you could offer to pay a share (eg if 4 siblings, 1/4 the cost?) of the moving costs and first month to get her into a small apartment she can afford. But ONLY if all her relatives bugging you pay a share. \n\nOr say you will meet with the family AND A TRAINED MEDIATOR (who is not family, to direct  the meeting) to find a solution. \n\nIf those are not accepted, just say no and block them on phone, text etc. so they cannot continue harassing you.", "NTA.", "OP=NTA  I'd consider going low contact on these people\n\nYou could try one more time with your sister and point out your HOUSEHOLD(2 adults/2 kids) is same size as YOURS and that once your Mom moves in with her--she won't live \"too far away.\"", "NTA Stop answering calls.

Why would you want this toxic person around your children?

You\u2019d want to say something along the lines of, \u201cI\u2019ve already given my answer and it\u2019s not up for discussion.\u201d Then either redirect the conversation, or if they don\u2019t let you, tell them, \u201cI\u2019m not discussing this and I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d  Then do it, and repeat this behavior until they get it and stop.\n\nIt\u2019s hard work to retrain people, and any time you slip and let yourself get pulled in to the discussion, you basically have to start over, but I promise you it\u2019s worth it.  Eventually, they know better than to continue once you\u2019ve said no.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Block the people who keep.pressuring you for a while. You've told them no and they know you are estranged. Block them so they can't harass you as much.", "This, OP don\u2019t JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain). They are pressuring you because they don\u2019t want to deal with her. Time to start giving out consequences. \u201cWe\u2019ve already discussed this and my answer hasn\u2019t changed. If you continue to bring this up I will end the call\u201d. Then you have to actually follow through. This isn\u2019t your problem to solve."]}
