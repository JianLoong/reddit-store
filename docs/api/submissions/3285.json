Of course you do not allow a person that is mostly estranged from you stay with you.  **You have valid reasons f**or this situation, and that's a good reason to not suddenly invite them into your safe space.\n\n**Your home should be your safe space.**  It should be where you relax and rest and recuperate from the trials that happen in the world.  Which means, you don't invite people to stay there, even for a day, that make your life worse and that you have to protect yourself from by limiting contact.\n\n *her own financial mismanagement,* \n\n**For this reason, alone, you would have valid reason** to not invite her to stay with you.  You cannot trust her handling of her own finances to know she would ever leave.  \n\n  *I very much doubt that this will be temporary.*\n\nYour doubts show that you already know better than to trust her.  **For that reason alone, it's valid to say no.** \n\n *I don\u2019t want her in my house. She\u2019s a bitter, petty, intolerable person*\n\n**For this reason, alone, it's valid to say no.** \n\nYou are being pressured.  You have valid reasons to say no.  You know that you have valid reasons to say no, and you have been saying No.  \n\n***So the problem is:  that they are still talking about this as if you haven't made a final decision.***  The heart of this problem is that while you have made a decision, they are refusing to accept your decision.  So, it's a lack of respect for you and your right to make decisions for yourself.  They seem to not have a problem telling you they can't do this, or with demanding you do it.  They just are all refusing to accept your decision.  \n\nSo, **what can you change about this?** \n\n* when they call you or text you, **refuse to discuss her situation**.  Don't talk with them about her finances, or her plans.  Give them three times the first conversation, and twice the next, and after that, once.   If they bring up the topic more than those numbers, end the conversation and say why.  \"I see you can't stop talking about this, so I'll talk with you another day, when we can maybe discuss something else.  Love you bye.\"  \n* If you hang up and they flood you with texts, **refuse to discuss her issues.**  Tell them once, and then do not respond at all to texts about her issues.  \"I will not be answering any texts about mom's finances or housing.\"  Respond to normal texts, normally, just not to those about her issues.  **You've made your decision and do not owe them more discussion about it.**\n* When you first start to do this, respond to them without giving your reasons for your decision, only give the decision.  They don't care about your reasons, they have the same reasons.  What they want is her off their hands, and on yours.  So **do not discuss your reasons with them at all.**  From now on the focus isn't on your reasons.  You don't need their approval to know your reasons are valid, they are valid.  \n* **Focus on the simple fact that there is not any reason to discuss this ever again, because:  You already made your decision.**   You can repeat this, short and sweet, many times.  Instead of reasons, say some version of: \"I've made my decision, and there's no more discussing it.\"  \"We aren't discussing this again, as I've told you my decision.\"  \"Do you remember that I already told you my decision?\"   \"Why are you still bringing this up?  I said no.\"  \"No, I'm not discussing my decision.\"  \"My decision is already final.\"\n\n**The plan:   State your decision.  Refuse to discuss your reasons for that decision.  Restate the decision and then refuse to discuss it further.  Then, either move to a new topic, or use an exit strategy and end the conversation.**  \n\n**Ignore all** the accusations, insults, manipulations and rudeness.  You have as much reason, maybe more, than they do to say No.  If they resort to these things, you do not owe any response.   Most manipulative people will resort to these things for one reason:  to keep us discussing the topic they want to force us to comply with.  Instead of responding, ignore those sorts of comments and digs.  It's hard.  It's hard when they accuse with lies, but they are doing it to get her to be your problem and not theirs.  \n\nWhatever issues your mom has, those are hers to resolve for herself.  If she had put effort all her life into being a responsible, kind, loving person that you enjoyed having around, her situation would be different.  But she didn't.  So, that's on her, too.\n\nAND **make a plan for what to do if she shows up at your door.**  Some manipulators will do this--expecting you will have to let them stay if they show up.  I've heard of them doing this with their moving van and another person had a parent come in an ambulance from the hospital, to the house of an adult child who was no contact with them.  **What to do if your mom shows up?  Do not let her inside.**  Text that you can meet at a local coffee shop the next day, but you \"aren't available\".   Make sure your kids don't let her in, either.  If a mistake happens and she gets in, pick up her suitcase and take it outside for her, immediately, not waiting for her to agree.  Then do the same with her coat, etc.  And if you have to call the police to escort her out, do it.   You can't give that inch here.   Another option is to have some cash set aside to pay for a single hotel night for her.  And then meet her in public, where you can walk away easily and make it clear that you already told her your decision, it's no, and it's final.   What she does is up to her, not you.", "NTA: Even if you had a solid relationship you can say no to things.  You've said no.
