{"id": 32488, "submission_id": "18c7ug2", "title": "AITA for not getting rid of my furniture for my roommate?", "selftext": "Sorry for the long post. \n\nI(21) am a broke college student. I live in an unfurnished apartment so I had to buy some furniture, but the rent itself is very cheap so I decided on the apartment for the long run. I also have a roommate who wants to save money as well, but she has problems with some of my furniture.\n\nI bought a mini couch off a friend who was moving away after graduation. It\u2019s sturdy and had a cover on, so I thought it would be okay to bring it home and change the cover. However, my roommate thought it was disgusting to sit on a used couch. I told her that my friend is super clean (she\u2019s one of the cleanest people I know), and that the mini couch would only be in my room. She still had her opinions but couldn\u2019t really say much because it would be my possession and would be in my room. We moved on.\n\nSomeone in our hall was moving away, and they put out signs in front of their door that they were selling/giving away a bunch of stuff. I was trying to buy a full mirror but didn\u2019t have the time to buy one, and they were very conveniently selling their full mirror for $5. I brought it home and put it in my room. I cleaned the mirror with the all purpose spray and it looked as clean as it could get. My roommate however didn\u2019t like the idea of me bringing used furniture inside the house, but she couldn\u2019t really tell me to get rid of it because it was again also inside my room, therefore wouldn\u2019t even be in her sight.\n\nA lot of students put up posts for move out sales on fb, and this one person was selling their monitor. I don\u2019t have a desktop and only work on my laptop, and the small screen has always been bugging me. I decided to buy the monitor and set it up in my room. I completely love how my desk looks now. But again, my roommate wasn\u2019t happy that I brought home a used item. (I honestly don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s so upset about it) She asked me if it was clean and if it was in good shape, and that cheap pricing isn\u2019t the only thing I should worry about. I told her that I\u2019m just trying to make my way around the tight budget I have. \n\nSeveral days ago, my roommate told me that she\u2019s been having nightmares of ghosts coming from my room. She said she has been having nightmares terrors ever since I brought the mirror home, and asked if I could get rid of it. I was pissed, but I honestly wasn\u2019t using the mirror much and didn\u2019t want to start an argument with my roommate, so I got rid of it. The day after that, she told me she had a night terror with a nightmare of a ghost crawling out from the monitor and asked me to get rid of it too. I told her no, and told her that she needs to stop thinking about my stuff, that she might be having night terrors because she\u2019s thinking too much about it. She told me that having these night terrors are not a joke, that it might mean something, but I never had a problem with the items, and I honestly think she\u2019s making stuff up to make me get rid of them. I told her I\u2019m not going to get rid of my stuff, and if she really wants me to throw them away, she would have to compensate for me. She was reluctant to do it, so I told her no and ended the conversation.\n\nThat was two days ago, and she\u2019s still fixated on the topic. She tells me that I\u2019m \u201ccheap af\u201d and that I should be more investing towards my possessions. Most of the stuff that I have are bought from amazon, walmart, and ikea. I had three items that were used, and now that I threw away the mirror, I\u2019m left with only two. I told her to get over herself and leave me alone, but she tells me I\u2019m inconsiderate that I would leave her to her night terrors for my \u201ccheap taste\u201d.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Could it be that she\u2019s really having nightmares and that the things I brought could be haunted? I\u2019m not familiar with supernatural things, so I don\u2019t understand if I\u2019m being a shit person or if my roommate just has a problem with me.

Don't let her do any more.\n\nNTA", "Replace her pillow with one you found in an alley.", "Seriously, does she even know she\u2019s living in a USED APARTMENT? \ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b", "I would be horrified by that. Fabric items are not something I would pick up from the side of the road.", "You sound like me.  The only things that are new are the mattresses.  I have antiques from when I lived over seas, my great grandmother\u2019s dining room chairs and table and a bunch of other old family pieces.", "Wait till she finds out about all the strangers who have sat on the toilet seat!", "Or rugs.  But I watch too many forensic-type shows.", "NTA.  She\u2019s neurotic and manipulative.  You might suggest she go to student health for counseling to help with her fears.  At least it\u2019s free.", "The night terrors definitely mean something, but it's not that the mirror is haunted. Let her move out and try to furnish an apartment of her taste/standards snd see how far she gets. NTA", "If she is having night terrors, she should see a psychologist to treat them. Make this about her, everything. Tell her to leave your belongings out of her mental issues and that she needs to help herself by getting help!\n\nTell her having you remove the triggers is not going to help her get better, it will just mask her emotional issues until she sees another trigger. Since discarding your stuff won't really help her, you see no reason to do that. Then tell her you hope she gets the help that she needs.\n\nI mean if she meets a friend, and goes to their house, is she going to not sit because the furniture is used!? No, she will sit fine! \n\nSeems she just wants to feel in control to me. Whether she wants to control you, or just the apartment I don't know. But she definitely wants to control something. Seems more like she wants to control you more than anything else. Is she also narcissistic? \n\nNta!", "NTA. It\u2019s a rite of passage to decorate your room with used furniture and found objects when you\u2019re first starting out on your own. I\u2019m old and still have some great stuff that I bought used. Your roommate is weird. \n\nHer \u201cnight terrors\u201d are most likely bullshit. What would be funny is if you hid a tiny speaker in her closet or bed and made haunted noises late at night.", "[removed]", "NTA - You have a unbalanced roommate on your hands. What you are doing is very appropriate and smart. Your roommate on the other hand need to learn to keep her opinions to herself. You need to establish some firm boundaries with her and certainly tell her her comments are rude and unwarranted. If she does not like it find another more hospitable roommate.", "NTA. I love used furniture, the older the better! As long as it isn\u2019t nasty\u2026 I just picked up a set of 4 wooden folding chairs from the 50\u2019s from a sweet old lady at church. Yay more seats for book club!", "She just sounds entitled and has someone paying for all her shit. Probably has no concept of how much furniture actually costs. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with buying anything used. All my furniture is used, got hella good deals. I probably have about 3 grand worth of furniture I got for 400 bucks. \n\nIt's also leather so it was really easy to clean off.", "Lord, I\u2019m in my 30s and I\u2019m still transitioning my belongings from all the used things I was given or purchased when I was in college and in my early 20s. NTA.", "Tell your roommate to mind her own business.", "NTA\n\nSome people are more sensitive than others about the history of objects. You've done your best to accommodate your roommate's sensitivities. If you're determined to stay put and keep her as a roommate, tell her to look up ways to \"purify\" her surroundings and suggest she try some things out because her phobias aren't putting money in your pocket to buy furniture right now.", "NTA\n\nTell her the only way you will get rid of anything is if she buys you replacements \\*first\\*", "NTA -- good grief, tell her crazy self to move out.  That SHE may be able to afford all new everything, but you're not so privileged and maybe she'd be better off living with someone else who has more money than sense.  I'd probably also walk around changing \"reduce, reuse, recycle\" to get that point across.... she sounds very wasteful.", "NTA, and start locking your bedroom door. If she's obsessed enough with your things that she thinks it's haunted (or lying about it, not sure which is worse), I wouldn't be surprised if they suddenly disappeared.", "How on earth is your roommate not going crazy from *living in a used apartment?!*  I can guarantee a LOT more people have used any particular apartment than any one piece of your gently used furniture.\n\nOh yeah, NTA.", "Your roomie is bat shit crazy. Good luck.  NTA", "NTA, roomie has issues.", "I've had my book shelf for 15 years. It's cute too, has a little pull out desk. I found it sitting in the dumpster area of a business in my neighborhood.

They don't make things like they used too.", "My couch is new too, it was a floor model half price on tax-free weekend. My arm chairs are antiques I had reuphostered. By the time it was time for my last couch to be redone or replaced, I couldn't find anyone to reupholster it for less money than a new couch. I do like the new couch - it's Italian and while modern, it hearkens back to antique lines as it has a bucket shape - so it's transitional - it also fit through the doors, which was a big issue I had for my old house - lol! Oh, and it had a single cushion for the seat - because if you are going to nap on a couch, you always fall between the cushions, so that was a thing, too."]}
