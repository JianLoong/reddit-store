My sister\u2019s had boyfriends, but if she suddenly kissed a girl while having a boyfriend, I would: i) think it\u2019s shitty of her to do that when she already had a boyfriend; ii) think she was bi, as OP does, and not that she was a lesbian.\n\n\u201cNon-het erasure\u201d lmao don\u2019t even.", "I agree thanks for calling it out", "Yeah, there's no way you don't know your parent's views on things like that. I picked up on mine by 7 or 8 and it's not like they hid it cause kids are usually overlooked as not understanding stuff, but forget they're usually very intuitive", "It was proven a thousand times that trying to keep teenagers from having sex does not prevent teenage pregnancy at all. If you aim to prevent unwanted pregnancies, educate them about contraceptives from early on and provide them.\n\nWhere I live, the huge majority of teenagers are allowed to have sleepovers with their bf/gf when they are about 16. They are educated on safe sex at like 13 the latest. It's completely normal to get contraceptives on every grocery store checkout. Our teen pregnancy rate is a fraction of the US. And most of those are because of the few religious nutjobs (people who don't handle it like this are seen that way).", "Well, it's not in the top 5 or 6 comment threads. I don't have time to go through comment by comment.", "Depends on what was meant by restricted from the house and if it's a reaction to them being gay or him sneaking people into the house to kiss them or lying or something", "I see what you did there \ud83d\ude02", "That's what she said", "~~I had the same first reaction, but actually we don't know the gender of the friend.~~\n\nEdit: It was a guy.", "I might have missed something, but I wasn't clear on whether the friend was male or female.", "How do we even know if it\u2019s a male friend? It could have been a female friend!\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Seriously. I always knew my dad wouldn't approve but I never would have guessed he was going to completely go scorched earth on the entire family over it. If I was living with him at the time I came out it would have been on the street. He disowned me even though he knew he was going to lose the rest of his family over it. So now nobody talks to him. All hed have to do is apologize but he'd rather die alone and bitter than acknowledge a trans daughter.", "Same here", "Yup ,I was similar, fortunately not hated but still, fortunately I had one thing going for me: I was so dense I didn't know enough to talk about!", "Yes it is. Ignorance isn\u2019t an excuse. Sorry not sorry.", "ops added comments confirms friend was a guy", ">unless they are actually from the middle east, OP shouldn't have had to worry was he actually about to out his gay brother (who possibly isn't even gay) to his parents and put him in danger.\n\nMy brother in Christ, do you realize how ignorant and racist that is? Bigots exist everywhere and can be any age or race, that's why it's important to not out people without their consent, because you **don't** how they'll react. Even if Wolfe isn't gay, his parents will carry that idea for the rest of their lives and will treat him differently as a result. OP is 16 in 2023, he should know that outing people is wrong and even if he didn'the isn't taking responsibility for his actions and is shifting the blame onto Wolfe in the comments. The reason people are going after him is because he should know better and Wolfe wouldn't be in this situation if OP didn't out him.", "I don't think it's possible for him to have not known his parents are homophobes.", "Bigots aren\u2019t going to change because you tell them to. OP knows how his parents are and still decided to shit on his brother. He\u2019s not any better than his parents.", ">have **had** girlfriends\n\nNeither currently has girlfriends, but they have had girlfriends in the past (and nobody gay has ever had a straight relationship while figuring themselves out or as a beard /s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I would: ii) think she was bi, as OP does, and not that she was a lesbian.\n\nExcept that's not what OP thinks, he thinks that his brother is straight (at most they'd be bi but prolly not even that tbh).", "But, you had time to make these two comments.", "OP provided more context in the comments. The friend was a regular and parents knew friend was there. They were planning to go somewhere. OP explaining things far differently than your mother who seemed to have a very practical and loving approach with you.", "It would seem that you kiss differently to most people.", "Or his brother considering his parents have already barred his friend from the house.", "Oh okay so he just outed his brother, lovely", "I assumed it was a guy- and this worst than an asshole moment if the sibling outed the brother before he was ready to be \"out\"", "Seems unlikely if friend was female they would be restricted from the house because of it and that OP's brother was embarrassed and went out of his way to deny being in a \"romantic\" relationship.", "Doubt they'd ban a girl from kissing when he's 18.", "I mean, I think regardless of friend gender OP is TA, so for me it doesnt really matter. But I can acknowledge it's an important factor that takes this farther than just \"i snitched to my parents my brother was kissing his friend upstairs\" because homophobes exists and will do horrible things to their children upon finding out and in the end what OP did is classified as outing his brother which I don't feel like I need to explain why that's wrong.\n\nMost parent's reactions to finding out their young adult male child is kissing a female friend in the home would be to either set rules about what is not allowed to be happening under the roof (doors open, no sex, etc) or try to start getting to know the girl thinking she'll be the next girlfriend, not ban her from the house entirely. The fact that these parents went straight to a complete ban of their son's male friend upon finding out they were kissing implies there is some hefty homophobia going on. OP did more than just break his brother's trust, he put him into a potentially dangerous and extremely vulnerable situation that he was not yet ready to be in and that's why gender matters here.", "Yes, absolutely. While the brother could get in trouble if the friend is a girl, he could've been in legitimate danger, if the friend is a boy. Like I don't know why some of you don't understand how dangerous outing someone can be. From being ostracized to getting kicked out and real violence.", "There's a difference between honest ignorance and willful stupidity", "How is ignorance not an excuse?  Were you born with an entire library of etiquette pre-built magically into your brain?\n\nHonestly, this is the issue with this sub, and with modern society in general; social conventions are treated as strict liability.  Say the wrong thing, and you're in the wrong, period.  And this leads to kids dressing up as their favorite Marvel characters being accused of just perpetuating the evils of minstrel shows.", "The OP definitely shouldn't have outed his brother, I totally get he has potentially taken away the brothers right to his own identity regarding his sexualiry. I'm not defending that beyond saying I genuinely don't think he knew it was an issue. I think that's actually a hugely positive thing. It feels like I'm one of the few who are actually criticising the actual homophobes. We should be teaching our children to stand up against homophobia, not to be scared of it.", "Yes, it takes 2 seconds to make a short comment and a long time to read hundreds of comments.

Hell, by then some people are raising their own child. Though they really shouldn\u2019t be.", "Ignorance of the law doesn\u2019t mean freedom from the law. Ignorance is a stupid excuse when any simpleton with the gift of thought could come to a rational conclusion.", "Thank you. As a homeschooling individual I am often in similar predicaments.", "I really doubt OP \"didn't know\", homophobes are never quiet about their bigotry, Father is very much vocal about how disgusted he is by Queer people especially Homosexual Men and Trans women, outright saying queer people should not be seen in any form of media and unprovoked telling me \"if you date a guy I'd be disappointed\" and at least one uncle I know is very open about using slurs against others.(I'm not open about my identity to family).\n\nIt's not \"being scared' of homophobia, it's being aware of your own safety more than anything, and in most cases in the US and abroad it is better to stay  within yourself, especially when you don't have the option to find somewhere where you can be yourself.", "You don't stand up against homophobia by throwing your brother under the homophobia bus though. We should be teaching our children to stand up against homophobia, but we should also be teaching people with the privilege to not be affected by it to protect the people it actually does affect from it. \n\nIt's also kinda ridiculous to think he didn't know it was a problem, it's literally a massive topic in any queer related media. If he knows about gay people, he knows about homophobia.", "Love to out the bigots here.", "For me it's grapefru- oh fuck...", "You guys are being too harsh on a 16 year old imo. People make mistakes. This was an AH move by OP but i hope he learns and grows from it. Or do you and every single one of your friends had everything figured out by 16? Hell, I'll bet most of you still don't."]}
