Those same tv shows show plenty of \u201cvillians\u201d as the newly gay teens\u2019 own parents\u2026so there are still plenty of warnings of the reality of what I am saying. \n\nYou don\u2019t know the parents, OP is only 16, and advising he tell his parents against brother\u2019s wishes, and then to tell brother they gang up against bigot parents, you have no idea the consequences of that either.
