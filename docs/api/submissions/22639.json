He just answered honestly. \n\nI'm covering a very soft YTA because OP is old enough to understand that certain things are private and should be kept that way", "\"I outed my brother without knowing if he was even ready to tell my parents.

Wolfe made no mention of keeping it secret to you before you went downstairs, just looked a bit embarrassed.\n\nYou didn't \"out\" him as other have claimed because he didn't confide in you in anyway, did you even know it was a factor?\n\nSo many people on reddit are quick to jump on the current trend they forget simple logic it seems -how was OP meant to know bro wanted it to be secret when bro said nothing when OP saw them and was open about it?", "Unpopular opinion idc but ESH, kind of.\n                          \nYou, for outing him.

I assume it will be hard for them to change their minds anytime soon sadly.\n                \nAnd your brother, I wouldn't say he's an AH, but he's definitely not the brightest tool in the shed. If you want to keep something a secret, then try your best to keep it a secret and don't make a surprised Pikachu face when things come out because you weren't more careful. Kissing someone openly when you want to keep the relationship or whatever in secret was not very smart. I wish the best luck, poor dude.", "NAH....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh no he was kissing his girlfriend... how dare he do something that's totally natural... for shame...\n\nUgh, who cares, there's worse things to be dicks to each other about.", "NTA - You were just \"kissing\" the truth! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udf08", "These people are all wrong.
