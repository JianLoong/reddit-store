(It most likely not helping the predicament, and probably made it a bit worse for his brother outing him, but it seems like they know cause only the friend got into trouble.) I got grounded for like 6 weeks for having my door closed once with a girl in my room.", "OP has said in other comments the friend is male.", "i see it. It reads like OP was really trying to avoid trying to gender the friend, knowing full well that this bit of information is vital to the story. \n\nDefinitely assumed this was the case, then confirmed when OP gave out this fact.", "OP mentioned it in the comments", "OP mentioned it in the comments", "Not just that, don't out people before they're ready to come out.", "Sometimes even if you\u2019re pretty damn sure your parents will be supportive they can surprise you in the worst way. I learned that the hard way.", "Not the story told in the post, but in the comments section he confirmed the friend is male.", "also, parents who would treat an 18yo this way have always been asshole parents. OP surely knew their reaction would not be favorable. YTA.", "Hello, autistic person here! I've managed to go my life without ever outting someone \ud83e\udd70", "No, actually, it isn't.  An ignorant person can learn.  A malicious person is hurting people for a reason.", "Not buying it. Even for very straight-and-narrow siblings, you don't tell the parents/adults when they kissed someone.\n\n\"\\[SIB\\] is still hanging out with \\[FRIEND\\]. I told them to come down\" is what you say.\n\nOP is YTA", "If he was in his own home or out in public I\u2019d agree. This isn\u2019t though. He just turned 18 and brought this person into his parents home. They have a right to know what\u2019s happening and with whom in their home.", "OP replied that the friend was MALE. YTA for every word you typed here and honestly, not worth my time. It WAS about outing them. You probably have very few friends. YTA and so is OP. Learn to read. Such an asshole.", "Yea I definitely assumed it was that type of situation", "How tf do you know? Your brother could be gay and be hiding that bc your parents are clearly homophobic, he could also be bi or just experimenting. Either way, homophobes like your parent's arent going to care to know the context, everything is gay to them", "Kid, if he was kissing another boy, he's at least gay-curious or bisexual.  Outing someone literally just means you shared private information that the other person may not have been ready to share yet.  \n\nFrom your comments, it seems you maybe genuinely didn't realize that it was a big deal.  That makes it even more important for you to take this lesson for what it is.  Know moving forward, that it's not your place to share information about other people unless they have given you permission to do so. Like literally ever. Any information at all.\n\nRumors only need one person to start, and they can ruin people's lives.", "My brother in Christ, he was kissing a BOY. How do you know he's not gay? Do bi/pan people not exist? Is it only outing someone if they're EXACTLY gay? But not even that, what was the goal in telling the parents? Just to stir the pot? If he didn't want people knowing he should have been more careful, sure. But it's also INCREDIBLY weird for you to randomly tell your parents! Who does that? I get the vibe that you just don't seem to give a fuck at all about anything from your post and all your comments. But there's being \"chill\" and then there's having no regard or respect for other people. If I were your brother, I would be pissed too.", "This. You have idea if you put the friend in danger, OP.", "It\u2019s a guy. You read it correctly. It was implied if the friend wants to go too and that OP said it in the comments.", "It\u2019s said in the post, I took the \u201cif he wants\u201d as meaning the friend not the brother.", "Why does gender matter in this case?", "Ya think? Are you always an impulsive snitch or just w gay stuff? Have you heard of discretion? \n\n16, past time to learn. YTA.", "then why did you tell them?", "Reading stuff like this makes me glad I never had any siblings lol", "I find it hard to believe that you didn't know how your parents feel either about gays or about kids dating. (I'm assuming their problem is that your brother was kissing a *boy* rather than that he was kissing *at all*, but hey, could go either way.)\n\nIf you're sure you honestly, truly had no way of knowing, then... you still need to apologize, because you *badly* misread the situation.", "depends heavily on degree/type of autism- have def interacted with severely autistic folks in my occupation who are intellectually advanced; but, socially challenged- even to the degree where responding factually to a question would be the only response they would consider- even to their own detriment.", "Yeah OP shouldn't have to worry. But depending on where they live, it's still a big deal. If we assume they're American, because that's generally what happens on this site, then what if they're the type of fundamental Christians who are salivating over DeSantis' 'don't say gay' and anti-LGBT+ bills? It's not some tiny possibility that they're homophobic, and it could have very real consequences for OP's brother.", "I hope you realize you are a terrible ally. As a member of the community you like to objectify, please stop.", "Do you not pay attention to the news? The world is still full of bigots, outing anyone is still dangerous. We don't get to pretend that we live in the world as it should be, we have to deal with it as it is.", "As a individual who is actually in the community as a Trans AroAce, your example is completely invalid.\n\nYour friend is clearly openly out as a Lesbian, where as OP's brother is not openly out, he is clearly very insecure about being out, if he even is Gay, based on the response \"we're not together romantically\" the brother is exploring his identity and does not want to be labeled or outed.\n\nOP asked if they are the asshole, not if the parents are the asshole.\n\nOP took away their brother's right to come out or not to come out.\n\nThen there's you, James, you're defending OP's actions suggesting the parents are the assholes when that has nothing to do with the question.\n\nYou're not an Ally, you're a person who uses us as a tool for your own personal gain.", "> I don't have to worry about saying to someone else she is gay as it's not a secret and there's nothing wrong with it,\n\nwhere do you live where you can just tell anyone your friend's sexuality and be 100% certain the person you're telling isn't homophobic? like...you actually don't have that privilege, because you aren't the one who'd be getting hate crimed! i'm saying this as a very visibly obviously queer person -- you DO have to worry about that because you are not the person who has to deal with the consequences.", "Regardless of gender, OP outed a relationship and screwed his older brother over. But since the friend is male, OP might\u2019ve outed both the relationship *and* Wolfe\u2019s sexuality + it\u2019s possible that OP and/or their parents did what they did out of homophobia.", "[removed]", "\u201cAt most\u201d smh \ud83e\udd26", "YTA and a bad brother honestly.", "1. You outed your brother that\u2019s not your place 2. You do not ever get to dictate what someone\u2019s sexuality is.", "No. You need to listen. OP is sixteen and it's 2023. There is no excuse for outing someone at this point. None. Even if it was an accident, it's a shitty thing to do and had apparently shitty consequences, and OP is still defending himself with \"but I shouldn't have to lie for him.\" He didn't even feel bad about it.", "Bisexuals exist.", "Well, I wouldn't say that. There are plenty of men who identify as straight who hook up with other men.", "Well congrats on ruining your relationship with your brother forever i guess.", "It's very clear why your brother doesn't seem to trust you with information like him being into a guy. YTA. And homophobic too", "You guess so ? You know exactly what you were doing when you did it take some responsibility for outing your brother.", "OP...Apologize and have a conversation with your bro !! this is a sad situation, don't let it fester", "Why the fuck do you think that would be a good idea?", "Bisexuals do exist. But with that, being bisexual automatically means you're not straight.", "A straight mam doesnt hook up with men. Identifying as straight while living gay is called lying", "A bad person?\nYou don't know him or what kind of person he is.\nPeople can do bad things without being a bad person.\n\nAdding OP, YTA!\n\nThat was an awful thing you did to your brother. Do better.", "By definition lol", "No its called being bi curious"]}
