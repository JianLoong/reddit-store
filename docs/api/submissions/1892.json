She may say 'You should want the best for me' but why at the expense of you getting the best? Plus you spent double on it!

It\u2019s your dress no one gets to demand you to give them your dress.", "NTA\n\nWTF?  It is your dress\u2026. She has a dress.", "NTA \n\nTell her she can do two things.\n\n1) buy her second choice dress who cares they look similar.\n\n2) Go and buy your dress too - spend another 12K  and you both wear it.\n\nStop entertaining this discussion, stop reassuring her, just point blank stop it. She can do one of the above. You will wear your dress and thats all. No one is stopping her doing one of the above two choices. It has no impact on what you wear.\n\nAlso learn from this - dont share things even to family ahead of time. Tell people its a surprise. Keep baby names to yourself too. Also you know that a 12K dress will be better than a 6K dress so just say i want to surprise you all on the day and end off.", "Hahaha this isn\u2019t real right\u2026\n\nShe wants your dress. So what? To bad.\nThis can\u2019t be real. Like seriously. What kind of person is actually like\u2026.\n\nGive me your dress. I deserve it.

WTH! It is your dress.", "NTA.\n\n>I really don't understand why she can't be happy in what she picked.\n\nSimple, she doesn't want you to be in her second-choice dress.", "NTA She is unreasonable. No one will take her side. Let her talk. It's all BS. You did a better job choosing s dress and she's jealous. Let her be jealous. Don't give her power to make you upset in any way.", "NTA. It's your dress that you picked out, she had an option and chose a different one.

So there\u2019s that. Your sister is acting disturbed.", "NTA. Brides can lose all perspective and demand ridiculously unreasonable costs and sacrifices from everyone around, instead of doing everything possible to give the guests an unforgettable celebration. At least once week here on AITA we get cringeworthy examples of brides exploiting friends and family in the name of some 2 hour visual fantasy. If i understand this story, OP and sister showed each other their wedding dresses simultaneously and sister immediately decided she liked OPs dress more, and demanded they swap dresses. In what moral universe does that make any kind of sense?", "NTA she choose her dress not your problem if she's now seen yours and changed her mind", "NTA seems like she didn't wanted to spend so much money for her dress and bought a cheaper dress, her secong choice. Now she is pissed that you have the dress she wanted but didn't wanted to spend so much money for it, so she want to make a dress swap - and voila she gets her dress for 6k.
