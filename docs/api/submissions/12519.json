A diaper would lead to a messy (possibly painful) daily bath, and probably skin problems because dogs aren't supposed to be washed daily. It must be very frustrating, but it also sucks to be old, taking care of an old pet you'll likely outlive. Not all fights are worth winning. Edit: just read about the back yard.

I'd still go the dirt route, but I see your frustration better.", "He should take his dog to a vet.

I wouldn't like to report anyone's dog to animal services, but that step might be warranted here, if the owner refuses to walk his dog in a sanitary way.", "I\u2019ve seen neighbors carry around pieces of paper for diarhea. It\u2019s not perfect but if the dog gives signs they are about to go, they slide the paper under. Makes cleanup easier. Just another suggestion instead of the diaper.

Your dog being old isn't an excuse to create a public health hazard. \n\nIf the dog has diarrhea, that's not an excuse to get diarrhea on the public sidewalk. It's every bit as bad as leaving any other feces on the public sidewalk, but also worse, because diarrhea signals potential infectious disease, and they are knowingly and willing creating a public health hazard. \n\nI personally would suggest taking the dog to do its business where it won't be leaving potentially infectious diarrhea where people walk or where children play. Perhaps the diaper comment was inappropriate, but the sentiment that he has no right to spread potentially infectious diarrhea all over the public sidewalks was absolutely valid.", "There\u2019s little squits of water and then there\u2019s piles of diarrhoea.

(i also will DEFINITELY be keeping in mind the paper towel suggestion for my own dog!!)", "It\u2019s a tough one when they get old. We lost our girl just over a year ago and towards the end she was very bad with diarrhoea. We did a few things to combat it. Firstly we would take her out to the garden multiple time in the lead up to her walks so hopefully she would get it all out there (and we collected what we could and hosed down the grass but it was our enclosed back garden so if there was a bit left on the grass it only affected us). However no matter how many times she would go out back when she went on the walk there were of course times it happened. First plan of action was that we took flattened poop bags, split open, or even kitchen roll or when things were very bad we cut up puppy pads and would just slide it under her butt as she went then it was easy to wrap up. Of course you can still miss things so we took a big bottle filled with water and ziplock bags with sand in them. You can usually clear up some of it using a poop bag with kitchen towel lining it inside, kind of half wiping the ground and half picking up \ud83d\ude02 and then rinse the area and sand over it. To be honest it wasn\u2019t that long before she was too tired to go on the walks anyway so the back garden took all the abuse. After she passed we just put fresh grass seeds down and it was all fine. It\u2019s never easy but with some planning you can actually take responsibility! It\u2019s not right to just leave it. Definitely the best way was catching her just as she was going and slipping a cut up bit of puppy pad under the butt. Just have to pay attention! The man is an ass, OP you are right to say something.", "I know, just because a dog is old doesn\u2019t mean it automatically will have diarrhea???", "Lol if you think animal services are going to do something about an elderly dog having diarrhea, wow we live in different worlds", "He also says it's because the dog is old, but how do we know? How do we know he doesn't just let it walk around with Pavo and refuse to treat it?", "No he is not, if your dog has diarrhea and you are in an apartment your definitely taking the dog outside to poo. You clearly do not own a dog so do not try to speak for dog owners.", "Can\u2019t really do that with diarrhea, but otherwise I agree", "on HIS land then. Not the public land.", "They were developed for keeping female dogs clean while in heat, for dogs with urinary incontinence that dribble urine when they sleep, and for assisting in potty training.  That\u2019s it.  They wouldn\u2019t help here because they\u2019re designed to still allow dogs to poop while wearing them, but don\u2019t bash something with a legitimate purpose just because you don\u2019t understand it.", "Whoa holy hostility. My dog is fixed she had her first period at 7 months. I have had palliative dogs. I\u2019m actually a rescue dog home. I wasn\u2019t suggesting diapering all the time constantly just if it\u2019s really bad. I don\u2019t see how calling me a moron is helpful here?

And it wouldn\u2019t hurt for him to carry a jug of water with. I usually only bring one on our long hikes but if my pup was having these issues I\u2019d definitely carry one.

Our dog constantly had diarrhea and her butt would be covered in it and she\u2019d leave little drips everywhere! Like outside, I mean. So I\u2019d only attempt to clean it up if it winter because snow makes it is so much easier to pick up.

Lately, I've put my girl on probiotics, and I can't tell you how pitifully thankful I was to hear a dry fart this morning.
