A diaper would lead to a messy (possibly painful) daily bath, and probably skin problems because dogs aren't supposed to be washed daily.

We lost our girl just over a year ago and towards the end she was very bad with diarrhoea. We did a few things to combat it. Firstly we would take her out to the garden multiple time in the lead up to her walks so hopefully she would get it all out there (and we collected what we could and hosed down the grass but it was our enclosed back garden so if there was a bit left on the grass it only affected us). However no matter how many times she would go out back when she went on the walk there were of course times it happened. First plan of action was that we took flattened poop bags, split open, or even kitchen roll or when things were very bad we cut up puppy pads and would just slide it under her butt as she went then it was easy to wrap up. Of course you can still miss things so we took a big bottle filled with water and ziplock bags with sand in them. You can usually clear up some of it using a poop bag with kitchen towel lining it inside, kind of half wiping the ground and half picking up \ud83d\ude02 and then rinse the area and sand over it. To be honest it wasn\u2019t that long before she was too tired to go on the walks anyway so the back garden took all the abuse. After she passed we just put fresh grass seeds down and it was all fine. It\u2019s never easy but with some planning you can actually take responsibility! It\u2019s not right to just leave it. Definitely the best way was catching her just as she was going and slipping a cut up bit of puppy pad under the butt. Just have to pay attention!
