Super sassy and bossy but still sweet nonetheless. However, whenever she sees her mom she does a complete 180 and to put it bluntly, makes it very hard to be around her. She comes back with the nastiest attitude and princess syndrome. Well, her mom wanted her last weekend, she wanted to go, etc. She's been rotten ever since. We had our annual camping trip planned so this came at bad timing. We headed out Monday after she returned from her mother's. We have a large camper (36foot).

Callie is literally losing her shit. She starts screaming at any of us for going in to \"her\" bedroom.

I talked to her father and said that as soon as it stops raining, she will be staying in the tent. I'm at my wits end. He agrees. So as soon as the rain stopped, he set up the 2 room tent outdoors and him and her stayed out in the tent for sleeping. This rubbed her the wrong way because she no longer had access to the TV or charging ports to charge her tablet (she's constantly on video call with her friends from school). She said I was treating her differently because she's \"not mine\" (I have NEVER said that- as I've been the mother figure in her life for 6 years and always say \"my kids\"- her included).

If it's not good enough then she's learned a lesson. Yes, she's a kid. But kids need to learn and it sounds like she has since she realises that it was better to be in the camper with other people \"in her space\" than in the tent without easy access to electronics.", "At 11, her hormones are probably kicking in. Get ready for a bumpy ride, puberty sucks.\n\nNTA, but boy are you in for some fun.", "NtA. She needs to learn that there are consequences to her actions. \n\nAnd playing the \"because I'm not yours\" card is not going to get her preferential treatment. She's 11, she knows how to manipulate, imagine hearing that excuse till she moves out. Stop it now before it's too late.", "NAH. It's very common for a kid's behavior to fall apart every time they visit their dysfunctional birth parent. Sometimes they're grieving what they're learning about the parent as they see them up close or they're unconsciously testing you to see if you're going to throw them away too. (But you're doing amazing work supporting those visits. As painful as it is, there is great data to support that kids with a realistic relationship with their absent parent do better than kids who just had a fantasy idea of the parent.)\n\n1) Get her a therapist. See if your local school can refer one.\n\n2) Think of her first week back as a tender week. A week to stay home and be fairly chill. Definitely not a week to try to gut out four days in the rain.\n\n3) As she comes into puberty she might start getting moodier and you might need to prioritize vacation plans that include some sort of private space for her to get away from the crowd.", "NTA as long as it was a safe option. I would have just taken away the pull out option and made her stay in a bunk bed and if she continued the attitude then escalate the punishment accordingly", "NTA as long as you weren't putting her out in the rain.   \nBut perhaps you and/or your husband should look into what's going on with her and her mother. maybe get her a therapist or something and make sure everything is okay. If she asct out every time she sees her mom, something deeper could be going on there.", ">She said I was treating her differently because she's \"not mine\"\n\nNo, you're treating her differently because she thinks she owns the entire camper.\n\nNTA", "NTA...She needs to understand that it was HER behaviour that put her in that situation.  You are the parents. The camper is yours, the television is yours, and the couch is yours.  Your punishment did not put her in any danger.  Hopefully, if she agrees to behave, she'll be allowed back in.", "As long as this solution applies equally to all your kids.

She needs to learn that lesson.", "INFO: have you talked to Callie about WHY her attitude changes every time after she comes back from staying with her bio mom? \n\nIt must be hard on a little girl to only see her biological mother once a year and then say goodbye to her for another year, so it makes sense for her emotions to bubble up. Add to that then spending a week in a camper without having her own room or privacy I can see how that would turn her mood sour. Obviously she should come to understand that it doesn\u2019t excuse being rude to your family, but I also think that you set her up for failure in this situation.", "NTA, if the same would happen if one of the other kids acts up. Also, if I were you and your husband, I would have a set amount of time, she is allowed to have the tablet and tv. She is 11 and you are on vacation as a family. ...", "NTA.

Sounds toxic.", "NTA. In that situation I'd have moved to the tent to get away from her.", "Years ago when my sons father decided to start seeing him and have overnight visits my son would be utterly nasty to me when he came home. Keep in mind my son and I had a strong relationship and he was normally a pretty good kid.  After several visits like this I finally sat him down and told him his actions where not acceptable and that if he had any questions or concerns he needed to talk to me.  There was anger and crying then he told me that his father had been saying pretty shitty things about me and blaming me for keeping them apart all those years.  Which was truly not true. His father has chosen not to a part of his life until and I swear I quote \u201che was old enough to be interesting\u201d. I literally showed my son the child custody papers that outlined his father\u2019s unlimited visitation rights. I had spent years not throwing that man under the bus because that was not in child\u2019s best interest.  But I was not going to allow him to alienate my son from me.  \n\nAnyhoo, long way round the bushes to say you have no idea what crap the bio mom is feeding your daughter when she is there.  But if the horrible attitude only happens after those visits something is happening or being said while she is there.  And that is what you need to figure out.  Talk to your daughter. Have your husband talk to her.  Let her know that she can ask you about anything that needs a concerning her. There may be some tough conversations but it will build a better relationship with her.", "oh boy, you are definitely gonna need to learn how to deal with the attitude her mother instills in her and quick, cause it will get worse as she enters her teen years.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nAnd I was going to put \"gently\" in there, but the more I think about it, the less I feel like you deserve the \"gently\", specifically because of you calling it \"princess syndrome\", which implies that her behaviour is some version of acting spoiled or entitled, instead of what it actually is: a trauma response.\n\nI don't know if you're just genuinely ignorant of how trauma works in kids, or wilfully choosing to perceive your child's behaviour this way, but I'm so sad for her, and you need to hear this . . . and not gently: Callie is (very predictably) being traumatized by these random, out-of-nowhere visits with her mother that disrupt the stability of her life as a young child and turn her whole world upside down, and that's why she lashes out and becomes obnoxious EVERY SINGLE TIME she comes home after one of these visits. I honestly don't know how you've made the connection about WHEN this is happening and haven't figured out the WHY. \n\nThis child has a bio \"mother\" who pops in and out of her life, as you put it \"maybe once a year (whenever they see fit basically)\", and leaves her reeling emotionally. How is she supposed to feel about that? Loved? By a mum who can't be arsed to see her more than once a year, but then probably acts like it's NBD and no time has passed, not acknowledging that she's barely in Callie's life? Abandoned? Once-a-year visits mean that this woman is basically a stranger to her . . . and yet people use the word \"mother\" to describe her. I can't imagine how destabilizing this must be for that poor kid.\n\n. . . and all you're concerned about is that it's \"bad timing\" because it happened when you'd planned a vacation. JFC, maybe worry less about your vacation and more about the serious long-term damage these visits are doing to your child's mental health. \n\nCallie needs to either not see her bio mom, or have a structured plan in place to help her cope when she does. She needs therapy - ongoing therapy with a professional who can help her make sense of why she has a mother who only wants to see her once a year, and why that's not her fault, and how to cope with the feelings around that. And you and your husband need to talk to a therapist about how to help her cope *so she's not melting down every single time she sees her mom*.\n\nYTA, massively, because your child is having a complete emotional meltdown every single time she comes back from seeing her bio mom and you're treating it like she's being a disruptive brat, and punishing her for it.", "ESH\n\nShe is acting like a normal hormonal teen, and I think the enclosed space is probably making it worse.\n\nYou as the parent should understand and give a little bit of grace to her.\n\nInstead of making the tent a punishment, it could have been offered as a compromise. Offered her a space of her own, instead of banishing her and making it like a time out.", "NTA\n\nbut why do you and your husband know that she  is always acting up after she was with her mother and then let her go to her mother before going to the camping trip?", "YTA for expecting a child to be all sunshine and sweetness after spending time with the parent who has made it very obvious she's unwanted. There was a better way of handling the situation.", "She sounds entitled/rude.   \n\n\nBut four days with six people total crammed in a camper sounds like toture not like vacation.", "NTA, an agreed upon punishment was given and followed through on, good for you.", "YTA! Do you really expect an 11 year old girl to have her supposed mother only see her once a year or so, then get rejected and sent back for another year, and she should be all sunshine?\n\nShe must be so confused and hurt. Kick her out of the camper? How about try to be more loving and understanding. \n\nTween girls are getting towards puberty. I'm sure her brain and hormones are flooding", "YTA. This was a parenting moment. Children are emotional beings just like the rest of us, but sometimes, they lack the experience to navigate their emotional life without guidance.\n\nI get it. She was being a pain in the ass. No one ever said parenting is easy. \n\nThis was a moment where this child needed support. I think sending her to the tent was the easier option for you in the moment, but it sent the wrong message to a child who was clearly struggling.\n\nI would feel differently if you sat her down and discussed her behavior and presented her the option to sleep in the tent in order to preserve her \"own space.\"\n\nFurther, I would be OK with it if y'all presented it as a consequence of her attitude and behavior not improving.\n\nI think sending her out to the tent without a preceding discussion sends the wrong message and fails to support her when she clearly needed it.", "Wow you just dump a child outside!!!!! She is clearly struggling with things and in response you mad mouth her online and then dump her outside in a piece of tarp. Get her professional help instead of dumping her outside and yes you are treating her differently. I can't see you treating your own biological sons this way!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What I did read incorrectly was that the step daughter rarely sees her mother. I can\u2019t imagine how that\u2019s affecting her but makes even more sense why the behaviours are there. Thanks for your input as well.", "I mean, there's a point long before four days in that you realize this cramped camper situation isn't going to work given the weather and you either head home or make alternate arrangements. OP and her husband absolutely dropped the ball there.", "Either way, it's not a situation that's going to HELP a tween manage their emotions.", "Oh good, reinforce the sense that her Dad's blood ties are the only thing that she has going for her and that she doesn't have a claim to a family unit.", "Bio mom doesn't have custody or a visitation schedule. Knowing they have the trip coming in they could have said no to a visit at this time and scheduled one for when they came back.\n\nThey went ahead with the visit with mom knowing she's going to be struggling when she returns and not making any plans to help soothe her until she feels secure again.", "So they have to cut their trip short because she\u2019s choosing to be awful? Or one parent is stuck taking care of all the set up without the other? Why would the grandparents want to deal with her shitty attitude?", "Why do you think it's on OP when dad agreed to it, and also, how do you know they haven't talked about it?", "Why do you think it's on op and not the dad", "no worries sorry if i came off aggressive its just the comments on this post that have been just ignoring the elephant in the room and having fun calling her a brat and entitled was getting to me.", "True, but every campsite that I've been at, you do have to pay a non-refundable deposit and since this trip was planned in advance they probably prepaid for their spot.  \n\n I think that I would have been holding out hope for a couple more nice days/improved behavior and not losing their deposit rather than packing up and heading home on day two for example.", "What? If she is so dumb and egoistic not to see family around her for years- nothing would help her.\n\nShe asked for personal space- she got it. She is not abandoned, she had an adult with her. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a claim to family shared space, what is not how it works", "She's a kid! She's not choosing to be awful. She's living though a shitty situation and doesn't have the tools to handle it well. She deserves some grace.", "She is a CHILD who spent time with a parent who has made it very obvious she's not wanted. She's not choosing to be awful. She's a hurt child.", "I think choosing to be awful and shitty attitude apply to you for saying this.", ">2 hr. ago  \n>  \n>Wow you just dump a child outside!!!!! She is clearly struggling with things and in response you mad mouth her online and then dump her outside in a piece of tarp. Get her professional help instead of dumping her outside and yes you are treating her differently. I can't see you treating your own biological sons this way!!\n\nOn account of how the OP doesn't place the root cause of the behaviors as the trauma, nor does she do anything to help the child deal with the trauma.", "I suspect if you own a $35k+ camper you can probably afford to eat the cost of the deposit and try again a different week.", "How old are you?  Because if the answer is more than 16 you need to take a long, hard look in the mirror and ask yourself why you see the issue here as an 11 year old's entirely predictable response to trauma and not the trauma itself.  \n\nBlaming traumatized eleven year olds irrationality on a personality flaw is... a choice, I guess."]}
