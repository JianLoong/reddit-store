I talked to her father and said that as soon as it stops raining, she will be staying in the tent. I'm at my wits end. He agrees.

Get ready for a bumpy ride, puberty sucks.\n\nNTA, but boy are you in for some fun.", "NtA. She needs to learn that there are consequences to her actions. \n\nAnd playing the \"because I'm not yours\" card is not going to get her preferential treatment. She's 11, she knows how to manipulate, imagine hearing that excuse till she moves out. Stop it now before it's too late.", "NAH. It's very common for a kid's behavior to fall apart every time they visit their dysfunctional birth parent. Sometimes they're grieving what they're learning about the parent as they see them up close or they're unconsciously testing you to see if you're going to throw them away too. (But you're doing amazing work supporting those visits. As painful as it is, there is great data to support that kids with a realistic relationship with their absent parent do better than kids who just had a fantasy idea of the parent.)\n\n1) Get her a therapist. See if your local school can refer one.\n\n2) Think of her first week back as a tender week. A week to stay home and be fairly chill. Definitely not a week to try to gut out four days in the rain.\n\n3) As she comes into puberty she might start getting moodier and you might need to prioritize vacation plans that include some sort of private space for her to get away from the crowd.", "NTA as long as it was a safe option. I would have just taken away the pull out option and made her stay in a bunk bed and if she continued the attitude then escalate the punishment accordingly", "NTA as long as you weren't putting her out in the rain.   \nBut perhaps you and/or your husband should look into what's going on with her and her mother. maybe get her a therapist or something and make sure everything is okay.

You are the parents. The camper is yours, the television is yours, and the couch is yours.  Your punishment did not put her in any danger.

Add to that then spending a week in a camper without having her own room or privacy I can see how that would turn her mood sour. Obviously she should come to understand that it doesn\u2019t excuse being rude to your family, but I also think that you set her up for failure in this situation.", "NTA, if the same would happen if one of the other kids acts up.

Sounds toxic.", "NTA. In that situation I'd have moved to the tent to get away from her.", "Years ago when my sons father decided to start seeing him and have overnight visits my son would be utterly nasty to me when he came home. Keep in mind my son and I had a strong relationship and he was normally a pretty good kid.  After several visits like this I finally sat him down and told him his actions where not acceptable and that if he had any questions or concerns he needed to talk to me.  There was anger and crying then he told me that his father had been saying pretty shitty things about me and blaming me for keeping them apart all those years.  Which was truly not true. His father has chosen not to a part of his life until and I swear I quote \u201che was old enough to be interesting\u201d. I literally showed my son the child custody papers that outlined his father\u2019s unlimited visitation rights. I had spent years not throwing that man under the bus because that was not in child\u2019s best interest.  But I was not going to allow him to alienate my son from me.  \n\nAnyhoo, long way round the bushes to say you have no idea what crap the bio mom is feeding your daughter when she is there.  But if the horrible attitude only happens after those visits something is happening or being said while she is there.  And that is what you need to figure out.  Talk to your daughter. Have your husband talk to her.  Let her know that she can ask you about anything that needs a concerning her. There may be some tough conversations but it will build a better relationship with her.", "oh boy, you are definitely gonna need to learn how to deal with the attitude her mother instills in her and quick, cause it will get worse as she enters her teen years.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nAnd I was going to put \"gently\" in there, but the more I think about it, the less I feel like you deserve the \"gently\", specifically because of you calling it \"princess syndrome\", which implies that her behaviour is some version of acting spoiled or entitled, instead of what it actually is: a trauma response.\n\nI don't know if you're just genuinely ignorant of how trauma works in kids, or wilfully choosing to perceive your child's behaviour this way, but I'm so sad for her, and you need to hear this . . . and not gently: Callie is (very predictably) being traumatized by these random, out-of-nowhere visits with her mother that disrupt the stability of her life as a young child and turn her whole world upside down, and that's why she lashes out and becomes obnoxious EVERY SINGLE TIME she comes home after one of these visits. I honestly don't know how you've made the connection about WHEN this is happening and haven't figured out the WHY. \n\nThis child has a bio \"mother\" who pops in and out of her life, as you put it \"maybe once a year (whenever they see fit basically)\", and leaves her reeling emotionally. How is she supposed to feel about that? Loved? By a mum who can't be arsed to see her more than once a year, but then probably acts like it's NBD and no time has passed, not acknowledging that she's barely in Callie's life? Abandoned? Once-a-year visits mean that this woman is basically a stranger to her . . . and yet people use the word \"mother\" to describe her. I can't imagine how destabilizing this must be for that poor kid.\n\n. . . and all you're concerned about is that it's \"bad timing\" because it happened when you'd planned a vacation. JFC, maybe worry less about your vacation and more about the serious long-term damage these visits are doing to your child's mental health. \n\nCallie needs to either not see her bio mom, or have a structured plan in place to help her cope when she does. She needs therapy - ongoing therapy with a professional who can help her make sense of why she has a mother who only wants to see her once a year, and why that's not her fault, and how to cope with the feelings around that. And you and your husband need to talk to a therapist about how to help her cope *so she's not melting down every single time she sees her mom*.\n\nYTA, massively, because your child is having a complete emotional meltdown every single time she comes back from seeing her bio mom and you're treating it like she's being a disruptive brat, and punishing her for it.", "ESH\n\nShe is acting like a normal hormonal teen, and I think the enclosed space is probably making it worse.\n\nYou as the parent should understand and give a little bit of grace to her.\n\nInstead of making the tent a punishment, it could have been offered as a compromise. Offered her a space of her own, instead of banishing her and making it like a time out.", "NTA\n\nbut why do you and your husband know that she  is always acting up after she was with her mother and then let her go to her mother before going to the camping trip?", "YTA for expecting a child to be all sunshine and sweetness after spending time with the parent who has made it very obvious she's unwanted. There was a better way of handling the situation.", "She sounds entitled/rude.   \n\n\nBut four days with six people total crammed in a camper sounds like toture not like vacation.", "NTA, an agreed upon punishment was given and followed through on, good for you.", "YTA! Do you really expect an 11 year old girl to have her supposed mother only see her once a year or so, then get rejected and sent back for another year, and she should be all sunshine?\n\nShe must be so confused and hurt. Kick her out of the camper? How about try to be more loving and understanding. \n\nTween girls are getting towards puberty. I'm sure her brain and hormones are flooding", "YTA. This was a parenting moment. Children are emotional beings just like the rest of us, but sometimes, they lack the experience to navigate their emotional life without guidance.\n\nI get it. She was being a pain in the ass. No one ever said parenting is easy. \n\nThis was a moment where this child needed support. I think sending her to the tent was the easier option for you in the moment, but it sent the wrong message to a child who was clearly struggling.\n\nI would feel differently if you sat her down and discussed her behavior and presented her the option to sleep in the tent in order to preserve her \"own space.\"\n\nFurther, I would be OK with it if y'all presented it as a consequence of her attitude and behavior not improving.\n\nI think sending her out to the tent without a preceding discussion sends the wrong message and fails to support her when she clearly needed it.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly I agree with your decision, especially given that it was a joint decision and your husband even went with her. She wants her own space, she got it. I'd heavily suggest avoiding saying things like \"rotten\" or \"spoiled\" in front of her though. Words really matter especially words like that. And besides, a kid can't be spoiled unless someone is spoiling them. And even though her mother is likely spoiling the hell out of her, that's not the norm. I'm sure her mother also encourages the idea that she isn't really a part of the family because she isn't biologically yours. You didn't specify, but I'd say it wouldn't be cool if you didn't let her back in the camper at all. As long as you're letting her in to use the bathroom, and eat, and charge her tablet, you're not in the wrong at all.

I would offer to let her come back into the RV to sleep and get her old spot back, under the condition that she understands that this is still a shared space. Be kind, gentle, and firm.

Either way you should sit her down and have a conversation with her. And if she gets emotional let her know it's ok and she is in a safe place to let it out. And be there and go through it with her.

Course I was just a kid back then with no filter. and as an adult now I simply would just start cleaning lol. \nIn this situation I don\u2019t think the mom was out of line. I do think some things could be added though. I\u2019d remind her that she didn\u2019t pay for that camper so none of it is hers. And I\u2019d also try and talk about why she\u2019s acting out to begin with. Sometimes it can be a trauma response and others it can be because they simply got used to a certain way of life and are now having to transition back. Kids don\u2019t have the capacity to really do that easily so you have to remind them and work with them. But like actually talk to them about those skills and acknowledging the difference between vacation life and normal responsibility life. You may get to use the tv all day when your on a trip with so-and-so but your back to your normal life and need to be able to work on doing that transition naturally.

It's awful.  But you've really exacerbated something that was very predictable.

A lot of people on here are calling giving her the tent a punishment, but I don't see it that way.  Your stepdaughter expressed a want/need for her own space.

She\u2019s a young girl going through significant trauma and around the age puberty starts. It\u2019s more than normal for her to want her own space, especially right after coming back from a very emotionally trying visit with her biomom. Presenting the tent as an option for her to have her own space rather than as a punishment would have been so much more constructive. And why wouldn\u2019t she have been able to come in to use her chargers like the other kids? I\u2019m sure she already feels separated from the rest of the family being the only one with a different bio mom, and to be cast out into a tent on her own or with her dad would definitely compound that feeling.\n\nPlease be sure she\u2019s getting therapy and that you give her opportunities to tell you how she feels without fear of punishment or scorn.

She needs both and you, as a parent, need to figure out how to provide it.\n\nShe's going to be very sensitive in being thrown out right now.  It wasn't the time for a camping trip for her, and the timing sucks, but I'd end the whole trip early and take care of her.  And the other kids need to learn compassion.

This is probably a reason why she's on the phone all the time, control of her weekends in non-existent.\n\n-Code shift between parents and change her personality based on who she's staying with\n\n-Understand the complex push and pull between parents. She may not comprehend that her birth mother is playing fun parent and is probably treating her a lot better b/c she is only there on occasion. This makes the gap between the fun parent and the serious parent seem unfair in comparison, so of course she's going to feel like you don't like her as much.\n\n-Contend with siblings for love and affection.

If she isn't respectful of others in the space, this no longer becomes an option. \n\n- In her own tent as soon as the rain stops, but with no electricity.\n\nGiven the scenario, hopefully she would choose to behave, and if she doesn't she's not surprised when she's forced into the tent.

With respect to the camping trip specifically, it seems like a lot of what she's upset about -- having space just for herself and having that space respected -- is directly related to her feelings of instability and her place within the family. Of course, Callie's behavior wasn't great, but she's *11* years old. She needs reassurance that she is a valued member of this family (not easy when her stepmother thinks of her as a nasty brat -- which I guarantee Callie has picked up on), which includes reassurance that there is *literally* a place for her within the family space. It sucks to be the one person whose personal space is given over to family usage every single day. To Callie, that is sending the signal that she is the least important person in the family and the person who can be mostly easily erased.\n\nIt doesn't matter that it's logical for Callie to be the one on the couch. It doesn't matter that this might be the only arrangement that makes sense financially. Callie is still getting the worst part of this vacation through no fault of her own, and she is feeling big feelings about it that her parents are just ignoring. No wonder she is acting out! \n\nAlso, once the weather improved, why couldn't the boys have slept in the tent for the rest of the vacation while Callie took the bunk room? Callie has put in her time in the shittiest \"bedroom\" on this trip. Or why couldn't OP have curtained off the couch for a portion of the day (e.g., from bedtime until noon?) so that Callie could have some semblance of a personal space? Yes, it might be less convenient for everyone else, but the arrangement as is was extremely inconvenient to Callie, and ignoring that fact validates her feeling that everyone else in the family matters more than she does.

If she wants to watch tv or charge her phone she can stuff the attitude and rejoin the family.\n\nI get it may mess with her mind having her mom barely having contact when her and that\u2019s unfortunate but she can\u2019t just take it out on the family that actually stayed around.", "It needs to be addressed but not allowed. I deal with this same thing every time my 11yr old twin daughters come home. They go to counseling and still act out when they first come home. While I do my best to make sure they know I UNDERSTAND why they do but THEY are in control of their emotions and how THEY treat others. By simply ignoring it, you are enabling they way they test someone based off emotion. In fact, My daughter learned how to manipulate us by doing this. Had to find another way to work around it.", "The psychological consequence better be I'm not that important and if I act like an asshoke I'll be treated like one. Kids aren't stupid, they can learn bad behavior leads to bad consequences without everlasting trauma. It's unfair trauma that leads to issues.", "They were stuck in the rain with nothing to do for 4 days, at least let the girl have her phone jfc. She's clearly already feeling isolated and your solution is to  make her feel even more isolated? Her ability to contact her friends sounds like its the only thing giving her comfort right now.\n\nIve been this girl before. Punishing her and isolating her is not the way.", "I mean, a couple of unfortunate camping/motel trips in a row right around when I hit puberty are what convinced my parents we were not going to go on vacation unless we could afford some more space. Honestly, I was probably not the most cheerful person, but my Dad ended up being the one that could totally not handle it.", "But at least she can find *somewhere* to go be by herself for a while at a motel.\n\nShe doesn't have that option when she's locked in a camper during a four-day deluge.", "Dude I\u2019m here for ya if you need someone to vent!", "If Callie hasn\u2019t been to see a therapist yet, I think it\u2019s time.", "[removed]", "I mean it's absolutly random, no idea why it's been given an award", "Bad behavior is a symptom, not a cause. Yeah, they can probably get her to stop with enough punishment. But a more effective solution is to help the root of the problem -- in this case, the emotional damage the deadbeat parent is doing.", "Exactly. OP and her husband did not handle this well.", "That\u2019s fair. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to be ignorant to something that clearly requires attention either, its too easy to look at the behaviour and assume she\u2019s being a brat when it\u2019s definitely a lot deeper. Difficult not to feel irate. Sorry if my post somehow came across that way too.", "I suspect any downvotes would be because people here seem to be really annoyed by \"This\" comments that don't add to or expand on the conversation, fwiw. \n\nI do think telling her she could either have exclusive use of the tent OR share the camper nicely, let her pick, and then holding her accountable for her choice would be better than just banishing her to the tent. I think I'd have also camped somewhere out of cell range.", "This. So much this. Edited: I expect to be downvoted by people that don\u2019t understand trauma.", "Yup, my mom and stepdad had a camper for a time and they told me the same thing. And unless there was a hurricane forcing evacuations or a deity coming down from the heavens, they absolutely would remain in that spot they \"paid good money for.\"\n\nThankfully, they had their camper days when we were all grown and well out of the house. As for me, give me a nice hotel or AirBnB instead.", "> True, but every campsite that I've been at, you do have to pay a non-refundable deposit and since this trip was planned in advance they probably prepaid for their spot.\n\nToo bad.  That's the risks you run when you go camping.  You don't punish an eleven-year-old for not wanting that. \n\nHell, I wonder if she was being forced to go in the first place.", "trust me this person repeats the same thing over and over again dont even engage not worth it", "I wish I could up vote your comment more than once.", "Many, many people buy used campers, and therefore pay significantly less than that.", "You don't  punish the whole rest of the family that were looking forward to a trip just because inconsistent biomom pops up either. \n\nBlended families are hard enough without the outside parents being this kind of inconsiderate and alienating. Trying to balance everyone's needs and expectations when a rando deadbeat pops their head up at their own whim is not always possible. \n\nBut you can't tell a kid who rarely sees her biomom that she can't see her because it's too close to family vacation. And you don't tell everyone else \"Too bad so sad you wanted to go camping but your sister doesn't want to so fuck everyone else.\" \n\nIf we let the desires of teens and preteens determine how we operate our families, it would be unhealthy for everyone involved. \n\nThere is literally no indication that the kid didn't want to go beforehand, you're writing fanfic now."]}
