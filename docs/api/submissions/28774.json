There has never been issues about driving until recently. \n\nA couple weeks ago he got a flat on Friday & couldn't get it fixed until Monday...

It's YOUR car. You were being kind enough to let him use it once in a while but now he's taking advantage. What about your miles? The fact that he's fine with using and abusing yours is a huge red flag. He should show respect towards your things.", "NTA\n\nGet your keys back.  He can get his flat fixed, he's just too cheap or too lazy to get it done.", "NTA\n\nLet me pile on with the others.  YOUR car, YOUR rules.  He is taking advantage of your meekness.  Get a backbone and stand up to him.  You don't have to justify anything.  It's your car.  Take your keys back and lock them up somewhere.  \n\nAnd move out.  This is not a good person to be living with.", "NTA. Hell, no. So he wants to beat your car into the ground rather than his own. I don't think so. That sounds pretty selfish to me", "Either share cars or have seperate cars. He wants the best of both worlds. He is being an AH about it. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nmake sure he can't get to the keys.

If he's not helping you buy and support your car, he needs to leave it alone.", "Is he paying half or more of the note? No? No keys for him.

Take the keys.", "NTA.\n\nSo ... his car is his and your car is \"ours\"? How about no. Don't let him use your car for *anything* if he's going to be that way about his car - it should go both ways, not just his way. And, BTW, putting 1000 miles on your car in 3 days is ridiculous - he cant possibly have racked all those miles just for work, and if he did, you're due the cash for that mileage from his workplace or income tax deduction.", "Nta. \n\nAsk him if he is gonna repair your car after it breaks due to the extra miles and usage he is doing tobit? \n\nAnd when he says no tell him thats why he needs to use his own car.", "So he wants to put all the wear and tear on your car so you\u2019re the one having to fork out for new tyres and god knows what else never mind having to service it more often.

Unless you live in Vegas, then that wouldn't be very exciting...", "This doesn\u2019t sound like a give and take type thing. Sounds like he\u2019s just taking.

Just because you don't drive as much as he does, it does not entitle him to use your car whenever he wants--ESPECIALLY if he's not going to respect it. It's your car, YOU get to decide what happens with it. You could park it for weeks, doesn't mean he automatically gets to use it.", "NTA.\n\nTake your keys away from him. He can put miles on his own car.\n\nHe obviously doesn't respect you because he thinks it's OK to put lots of wear on your can instead of his, as if your transportation needs don't matter. He has a car, so make him use that.", "NTA at all", "NTA.  Your car so do not let him use it.  If he takes it without permission report it as stolen.

And not by practically stealing your car. You don't use it as much?!? Then why did he get that deal? Tinted windows? Why did he get them; all leased cars don't have tinted windows.\nHe made a bad deal, and now he expects to use your assets to fix it.

But I agree! waaaaay too many miles for 3 days. & he did put the spare on the car but it sat in the driveway until it was fixed.", "What makes it worse is he crashed his last car. Got a settlement check (nice one) to put down on this current car. He financed it for 4yrs, and bought the tinted windows after knowing it was on the verge of illegal amount. Why he all of a sudden is scared to drive w/ tint at night is beyond me ( & per him, his car is too nice to take it off.. lol) .. That's why I think he's more paranoid about his mileage. But as I've gathered here, it's not my problem! I just need to be firm from now on. I drive like 7-8k miles a year and he seems annoyed my car isnt used as much or something idk.", "This is clearly a relationship red flag issue. Perhaps you should not be living together.
