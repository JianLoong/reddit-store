She's my aunt, she should be in my life, she should know what's happened.\n\nOn one hand, it feels petty and I tell myself to be the adult in the situation and let it go.

That would be really mean and make YTA.  \n\nIf you want your aunt to be more involved in your life, just pick up the phone and call her.  It takes 2 people to keep a relationship going;  it\u2019s not solely up to her.  Ask yourself what you know about your aunt\u2019s life for the past year.

It\u2019s nice she even included \u201cfur kids\u201d in the card bc sometimes people dont even think twice about other peoples pets", "YWBTA. I'm very sorry to hear about your losses, but your aunt May be doing this as an effort to try again. She had no idea, and this could be your chance to reach out and tell her about your life. Get to know each other. It sounds like an honest effort, don't be mad that your family doesn't reach out if you bite their hands every time they try", "YWBTA. She was reaching out and had no way of knowing about your cat. Hell, I got a Christmas card one time a month after my father passed from an old college friend that said \u201c Say hi to your parents for me.\u201d I was thrilled to hear from her and understood we had not had a chance to update each other. Get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nSpare your aunt this misdirected rage and call your therapist.\n\n>  She's my aunt, she should be in my life, she should know what's happened.\n\nThat's ridiculous. It's an *aunt*.", "YWBTA. Seems like she made an effort to reach out despite your estrangement and wish you a merry Christmas, and you returning the card like that just makes you look silly and petty.", "yta - unless your aunt has a crystal ball she can wave her hand over she would not have known your pet passed on.  sounds like she was thinking about you so she posted a card to you.  look at it as an olive branch of sorts.", "YTA- wow\u2026. Is the rest of your family toxic like you ? She didn\u2019t know and probably had it before your cat passed away.", "YTA.  For all you know, she sent her cards before your pet passed away.  Either way, it's an honest mistake.  You're letting your grief color your perception.  \n\nMy condolences on your losses this year.  FWIW if your family doesn't seem to care, it's possible they don't know how much you're hurting.  Losing the ability to have children isn't the sort of loss that people understand right away.  Losing your grandfather and your pet, that's a grief we all experience.  Fertility loss is a different thing, not better or worse, but cloudy.  They may not know what that means, or what it meant to you.  \n\nWe, as a society, don't discuss fertility matters publicly, and often we hide those painful experiences because we don't want to make others uncomfortable.  Likewise, our loved ones won't know what to say, or how to act.  Should we bring it up, or will that upset you?  Should we act like everything is normal?  Nobody knows what to say or do, even if we want to help.\n\nThat's not your fault, either, but if you need to talk, reach out to the people who care about you.  Tell them you are hurting, and give them space to process with you.  If they can't or don't provide what you need, feel free to dm me and we can talk.  I haven't experienced what you went through, but I have some experience with similar issues, and I know how difficult it can be to articulate what you're feeling.", "YWBTA.

I think it\u2019s good to read the books you\u2019re recommending to your family\u2026", "YWBTA... You mentioned your family doesn't communicate. So her taking time to send you a card was thoughtful of her. Did you send her anything? Do you know what is going on in her life? Probably not. It happens... Life gets that way sometimes and you have definitely had a tough year, but try not to misdirect it at her. Maybe call her and tell her? n I'm so sorry for your loss...i know how much our furry children mean to us.", "YWBTA. Your first sentence was \u201cmy family is a mess\u201d and you \u201ccommunicate terribly.\u201d This was an opportunity to build a bridge and instead you went a petty route which is probably contributing to the \u201cmess.\u201d This is not a model of good communication.", "YWBTA.\n\n*I want to use a red pen, cross out the 's' in furkids*\n\nCould you not just do this, if the extra 's' upsets you? (And I understand why it does.) Or put a sticker over the extra 's' or something? Or just ...  throw out/recycle the card?\n\nI get why you're upset, it's a reminder of your kitty's absence. It's awful to lose a pet (my cat went to the Rainbow Bridge on April 1st, and I miss him every day).\n\nHowever, I'd bet money that if your aunt went to the trouble of mentioning your pets, she didn't do this with the card to upset you. Also, you say you had to put your cat down 'a few days' before Christmas. My guess is, she prepared/mailed this card before then.\n\nAnyway, crossing out the extra 's' and mailing the card back would be petty, passive-aggressive, and yes, AH-ish. (Not to mention, a waste of postage.) \n\nJust tell her about your situation, or appreciate her intentions and move on.\n\n(That said, in all sincerity, take all the time you need to grieve your cat.)", "YWBTA - just throw it out, no need to act like a teenager about it", "YWBTA. She very well could have written the card and probably mailed it before you had to put the cat down. She didn't do it to make you hurt more. Toss the card, don't do something horrible to lash out. Your grief and anguish doesn't need to be directed to people who didn't cause it.", "YWBTA. It\u2019s going to sound horrible but I\u2019ll be blunt: your life is about you. Your aunt\u2019s life isn\u2019t about you. She\u2019s got her own issues going on. I\u2019m sorry that your furbaby went over the rainbow bridge but sending the card back corrected would be petty and start 2023 in a shitty way.", "YTA such a passive aggressive idea is probably exactly why you have communication issues with your family. It makes me wonder if they are the problem or you are the problem", "Read those books again lol. Sounds like she meant well with the card. If you want to talk about the death of your pet with her, do so in a mature way.", "You said you're not close to your aunt but she was considering enough to send you a card. You don't know what's going on each other's life so she made a small mistake and you want to be petty like  that. If you do this you will never have to worry about getting another card from her again", "Maybe act like an adult and talk to her rather than this oddly passive aggressive response to a situation she wasn\u2019t aware on because she has her own life too\u2026 YTA", "The civil way to do it is to politely thank her for the card, and let her know that your lost one of your companions. YTA.", "YWBTI. \n\nYou know in the Christmas card culture, people often send out dozens and dozens...maybe even hundreds. They often start making them out and addressing them weeks or months in advance and mail them all at once. \n\nMy relatives don't usually keep abreast of my pets lives with the exception of my aunts and uncle and its just the one pet...a dog that belonged to my mother who passed earlier this year. \n\nI'm sorry but not everyone puts pets on equal footing to children. If this had been an actual child, I could see it being wildly insensitive because a child dying tends to be a much bigger topic of discussion in the family. \n\nThrow the card away if it offends you so much.", "Did you tell her you lost your cat?  Was the card sent before that?", "YWBTA and even though it might give you a moment of relief it won\u2019t ease your grief. I am so sorry you have had these losses.", "Well first I must say that is a shitty year, I\u2019m sorry for your many losses. That just sucks.\nNext, onto the question you pose, unfortunately YWBTA for the reasons you already said. You know it, just let it go.", "Sounds like you're having a whopper of a time lately. So sorry for your troubles. \n\nYWBTA if you sent the card back to her. You could try good some positive communication and offer her an olive branch- call and thank her for her card, ask her how she's doing...If it's possible, work into convo that you lost your cat, and maybe the other stressors (but maybe not).", "YTA. I know you're going through a lot, so I don't think you're *an* asshole. But the appropriate thing to do here is to let your aunt know that you feel neglected, not to engage in passive aggressive nonsense (giving people books instead of talking face-to-face about how you're feeling is also pretty passive aggressive). You might even do it in such a way that she doesn't lose face, like, tell her it meant a lot to get a card from her, because you've been having a hard time and have been really lonely.", "YTA and holy shit you sound dramatic. I'm sorry for your loss, but just because you're *\"feral with grief\"* (wtf kinda phrase even is that?) doesn't give you the right to take it out on others. For all you know, it could have been a goddamned typo which happens when you write things. You sound just as bad as your family, but you tried to make yourself out to be better than them.", "YWBTA.  Please don't do that. \n\nI would take this as an olive branch from your aunt and a chance for you to improve communication with this relative who seems to be making an effort. \n\nI'm sorry for your losses this year. Hoping that 2023 will be better.", "YWBTA.", "agreeing with everyone else so far. Yes YWBTA. Family falls apart some times and you cant expect anyone to kniw whats going on in your life without telling them. You honestly sound immature and just need a little time to grow up and figure out what adult life is like. Unless you are a grown adult, them you just need to learn responsibility and grow up.", "I think you'd be more of a dumbass than an asshole.", "YTA \u2014 or you would be if you did this. How would she know your pet died? It sounds like she\u2019s trying to reach out to you. If you are angry with her, address it in an adult way. Don\u2019t get complicated with a stupid corrected card. Just send her an email where you explain your feelings.", "Not only the asshole, but a GIANT asshole. \nGet over yourself - say thanks to your aunt and move the fuck on", "YTA - I get that you're going through shit but there's no reason to punish your aunt for that.  She sent you a card, which means she's trying to be in your life.  If you're not talking to her, how is she to know what you're going through, or that you lost a furkid?  Try sending her a thank you card, a genuine thank you, without jabs or sarcasm.  You might find it easier to have people in your life.", "YWBTA. \n\nPeople have to send Christmas cards in the mail weeks before Christmas for them to arrive in time. If your pet was euthanized \"a few days before Christmas\", your aunt had already signed and sent the card when your pet was still alive. So not only would your reaction be completely unreasonable, in essence your stance wouldn't even be logical, the pet was still alive when she sent the card...\n\n\nAlso, most people do not include any mention of other people's pets on cards, certainly not Christmas cards. You consider it a fault that your aunt didn't know one of your pets died (even though it was probably still alive when she wrote the card) even though like 99% of people never would have bothered to mention any of your pets to begin with. Just saying.\n\n\nI think you should consider utilizing therapy not just for communication issues. The things you list on the bottom of your post is probably why you're upset, but you're using this card from your aunt as a way to direct your anger that's really because of those other reasons. Not a healthy coping system tbh and will really burn bridges for you long term.", "You\u2019ve had an absolute shit year, and I am so so sorry you have to deal with all of that. It\u2019s completely understandable that your emotions are running so hot, but let\u2019s take a deep breath and look at this from another angle. \n\nThe time frame in which you need to look is from the day your baby passed to the postmark on the envelope. It\u2019s within the scope of reason that when your aunt wrote the card your pup was still with us. It\u2019s feasible that even if your family knew how to communicate that the card would say the same thing. \n\nYou are grieving and looking to lash out. This is so human. But still YWBTA. Don\u2019t let this be the hair that clogs the drain.", "Yes ywbta is it possible that she doesn\u2019t know what happened to your pet? And if she does, did she mail the card after your pet died? And even both of those things are true, you can simply just let it go and realize that sometimes mistakes like this happen with no malice intended.", "Maybe she sent it before your furbaby\u2019s death and the post is slow? Look you had a crappy year but taking it out on someone who cared enough to send you a card and mention your furbabies isn\u2019t really fair.", "YWBTA. It sounds like 2022 was a terrible year for you and I\u2019m sorry about that. But your aunt was trying to be nice.  She made a gesture. Throwing it back in her face isn\u2019t going to further your real goal of more and better communication.", "Unless you communicated to your aunt that you lost one of your loves how was she to know? Grief is cruel and makes us do things out of \u201cnormal character\u201d. I know you\u2019re getting some harsh words from them sub, but don\u2019t take it too personally. YWBTA if you sent the card back with \u201ccorrections\u201d; I think a better alternative is to simply throw it away.", "VERY soft YWBTA because to me this feels like a straw that broke the camel\u2019s back situation. OP, I am so sorry for what you\u2019re going through. Losing a beloved pet, your grandfather, and the ability to have kids in such a short period of time is so much to deal with.

I hope you feel better soon, I suspect the loss is making you meaner and angrier at the wrong person when you\u2019re just mad at life.", "YTA", "Wow. This screams big \u201cpick me\u201d energy. You return that card and you will definitely be TA.", "yta", "So you give books about communication but your answer to a well meaning Christmas card is a passive agressive red barred postcard send back\u2026 \nYou drag people to counseling but you\u2019re reproaching your aunt for everything that\u2019s going wrong in your life when she has nothing to do with it\u2026\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your losses and health issues, but maybe you should look at yourself, because you sound a bit hypocritical. Doesn\u2019t seem you\u2019re in the place where you can give lessons to others, maybe you should learn a bit instead.", "As others have stated yes you'd absolutely be TA. However if you're looking to pursue healthy communication and a bridge with an estranged relative... who did not know your fur baby had passed away (sorry for your loss btw), you could communicate to them that you appreciated the holiday card, and appreciated that she included your furkids. Then let her know that unfortunately one passed away right before Christmas. \n\nI'm not getting the impression this was done out of maliciousness, and the best way for her to know what's going on in your life if you want that is for you to tell her. Maybe write a letter filling her in. Talk about your pet that passed and your grief. Take your own initiative with healthy communications. \n\nSorry again for your loss. I had a cat that just shy of 20 years old pass away a few years ago. I was entirely inconsolable for days, absolutely wrecked with grief. It's still sad to consider now... but I would have been more reactive to a well wish for her in the immediate weeks after than I would be today.", "I can't call you an ah bc you're self admitted to be feral in your grief. But yeah you would be an ah if you did that.", "INFO Did you *tell* her about the loss of your sweet companion? If not how is she \u201csupposed to know\u201d?", "My condolences for your loss but how would aunt have known if y\u2019all don\u2019t talk? Don\u2019t be petty now. It\u2019s not worth your effort. YWBTA.", "YWBTA she reached out to extend the olive branch and let you know that you were loved and thought about it.  You will be the one keeping it going if you send that card back.", "Call her. Get past it. Explain the situation and move forward with life.", "YTA. If some family member who rarely if ever communicates with me sent me a book on how to communicate better, I\u2019d laugh and toss it in the garbage. Looks like your aunt is doing a better job of it then you, Oh Master. Snort", "Did you tell her you had to say goodbye to one of your pets? If you didn\u2019t, it\u2019s a perfect example of your family\u2019s lack of communication. Is your aunt suppose to guess you lost a pet probably just as she was mailing cards?", "YTA.", "YTA and petty and in desperate need of that therapy you made others attend", "yeah, you'd be the asshole. how old are you that you expect distant family to know or be involved in your every life event?", "Yta it\u2019s just a dog", "YTA. What you are suggesting to do is completely psychotic, not just petty. Relationships are a two way street. Giver her a call or take the L. If someone doesn\u2019t want to be in your life, don\u2019t force it. They will just make you miserable.", "Unless you personally have told her about all of those things, you cannot fault her for not knowing. Especially if that card came by mail; how long have you known you needed to put your fur baby to sleep? A week? Two? Less? Due to postal delays around the holidays, and depending on where your aunt is in relation to you, she could have mailed that card as much as a month ago! \n\nYWBTA. One, mistakes happen. Two, communication is a two way street. If you're not talking, you can't blame them for not listening. And three, relationships are also a two way street. When was the last time you asked her about her life? Model the behavior you want to see, don't just judge.", "Lol at the edit: why don\u2019t you just throw it away?", "YWBTA - I will say though, it\u2019s refreshing for someone to accept the TA judgement and decide to do better. Good on OP", "Burn the card ceremoniously. Pretend it is all of 2022. It sometimes helped me in the past. NTA for your feelings but you would be the AH if you corrected and sent it back. Dont send it back.", "This comment is spot-on.  You can gently let your aunt know her card made you sad bc you had just lost your pet, and in the same breath say \u201cand it made me realize I need to ask about you more, too\u2026..and then ask her about her life.", "There seems to be only one person trying to communicate with the Aunt sending a Christmas card. Getting upset at the person trying to communicate for poor communication, I believe the phrase \"the nerve of\" was invented for such situations.", "This is one of the best responses I\u2019ve ever read on this sub", "I would say it\u2019s nice she sent a card considering they\u2019re estranged. Maybe she is reaching out.", "Also OP\u2019s grandfather passed. Was that OP\u2019s aunt\u2019s father? If so, kudos to her for even taking the time to send cards in the first place. I legitimately have a six month gap in my memory after my father died. I certainly didn\u2019t send anyone cards, let alone cards that show that I\u2019ve done a good job keeping up with their lives!", "Both of my aunts haven\u2019t met my human baby and he\u2019s almost a year. I\u2019m not tripping.", "This is a really excellent point. I spent a lot of time in pregnancy related subreddits recently, and easily a fifth of the questions were people asking for advice for how to help family members experiencing pregnancy loss or infertility, or how to announce their own pregnancies while being mindful of a loved one with infertility. It's definitely something we need to talk about more as a society, but in the meantime no one really knows how.", "Why blame random people and yell at them about your dead dog. I have lost my favorite dog as well but I\u2019m not yelling at others about it. \n\nOp probably didn\u2019t tell the aunt because she mentioned they don\u2019t talk. The aunt most likely sent the card before OP put her pet down. The aunt was being nice to her but OP was going to return it and be rude for something that\u2019s not the aunts fault. OP is the a-hole that needs therapy. \n\nYou should see a therapist as well if you are yelling at innocent people over the dog.", "How is she \u201cwasting years of her life\u201d when she was the childish one. The aunt didn\u2019t know the cat died. The aunt most likely sent the letter before the cat died so it\u2019s not her fault. OP chose to be rude instead therefore OP is the a-hole.", "Hell, I found out at Christmas my sister was diagnosed with diabetes 6 years ago.\n\nI was like \"How did I miss that news?\"\n\nBut, somehow, I did.", "I\u2019ve been telling myself and my family that for a while. If I want a relationship with some family, I have to be willing to put in the work and reach out and hope they reciprocate. I can\u2019t expect them to be mind readers and know I\u2019m dying to hear from them.", "I feel your pain. I gave my bank my husband's death certificate 3 times. I still get mail for our account with both our names on it. Thanks for reminding me hes not here anymore, Commerce.", "I am on the spectrum and it would never occur to me to be that nasty to my aunt who was trying to be kind to me. My husband doesn't like Ohio state. My aunt didn't know this and sent us Ohio state cups for Christmas. We said thank you. Aunts don't know everything. As an aunt I definitely don't. It would be such a huge jerk move to reject a card that was meant to be nice and inclusive.", "Okay just because most of you including yourself have ASD does *not* mean you\u2019re toxic. Toxicity is a choice not involuntary so if you don\u2019t communicate well, then take classes and get regular therapy. You can\u2019t control what they do all you can control is yourself. But yeah, communication is a 2 way street and you most definitely WBTA if you sent it back as that\u2019s very vindictive and she at least had the decency to send you a card.", "She is wasting the years for even trying to fix broken relationships. I don't mean this situation in particular but her ongoing repair efforts. There is a backstory to this incident.", "She\u2019s just as bad as them. Even when her aunt was doing something nice she was going to be rude for no reason.", "Please tell me how to get this extra day of the week. I need it.", "Every family is different so your wish will not happen and that\u2019s something you need to accept. I have ASD and it\u2019s a struggle to communicate with my family who isn\u2019t on the spectrum but it\u2019s a constant effort I put in and will up front discuss things without assuming and sometimes over explain to make sure what I\u2019m trying to say is understood and not misinterpreted", "Even if it\u2019s a workday and not a weekend? Lol"]}
