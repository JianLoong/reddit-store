Unfortunately, I had to have one of them put to sleep a few days before Christmas. So it's just one furkid now.\n\nI want to use a red pen, cross out the 's' in furkids and send the card back to her. Every time I look at it, I feel angry. It feels like such a stark example of the fact she doesn't know what's happening in my life and doesn't really care. She's my aunt, she should be in my life, she should know what's happened.\n\nOn one hand, it feels petty and I tell myself to be the adult in the situation and let it go. I know doing this would be an example of poor communication, and despite our difficulties I still try to model good communication, in the hope that maybe we can improve things.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm feral with grief for my lost cat, my grandpa who died this year,  an arson attack on my home, the fact I had to have an endometrial ablation which means I can't have children- and my family doesn't seem to care. 2022 has been lot and this just feels like the last straw. I am buckling under the weight of all this.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I sent my aunt back the corrected card to make the point that she's absent from my life?\n\n\n\nEdit: Ouch... well, that seems unanimous, and I accept the judgement.

That would be really mean and make YTA.  \n\nIf you want your aunt to be more involved in your life, just pick up the phone and call her.  It takes 2 people to keep a relationship going;  it\u2019s not solely up to her.  Ask yourself what you know about your aunt\u2019s life for the past year.

It\u2019s nice she even included \u201cfur kids\u201d in the card bc sometimes people dont even think twice about other peoples pets", "YWBTA. I'm very sorry to hear about your losses, but your aunt May be doing this as an effort to try again. She had no idea, and this could be your chance to reach out and tell her about your life. Get to know each other. It sounds like an honest effort, don't be mad that your family doesn't reach out if you bite their hands every time they try", "YWBTA. She was reaching out and had no way of knowing about your cat. Hell, I got a Christmas card one time a month after my father passed from an old college friend that said \u201c Say hi to your parents for me.\u201d I was thrilled to hear from her and understood we had not had a chance to update each other. Get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nSpare your aunt this misdirected rage and call your therapist.\n\n>  She's my aunt, she should be in my life, she should know what's happened.\n\nThat's ridiculous. It's an *aunt*.", "YWBTA. Seems like she made an effort to reach out despite your estrangement and wish you a merry Christmas, and you returning the card like that just makes you look silly and petty.", "yta - unless your aunt has a crystal ball she can wave her hand over she would not have known your pet passed on.  sounds like she was thinking about you so she posted a card to you.  look at it as an olive branch of sorts.", "YTA- wow\u2026. Is the rest of your family toxic like you ? She didn\u2019t know and probably had it before your cat passed away.", "YTA.  For all you know, she sent her cards before your pet passed away.  Either way, it's an honest mistake.  You're letting your grief color your perception.  \n\nMy condolences on your losses this year.  FWIW if your family doesn't seem to care, it's possible they don't know how much you're hurting.  Losing the ability to have children isn't the sort of loss that people understand right away.  Losing your grandfather and your pet, that's a grief we all experience.  Fertility loss is a different thing, not better or worse, but cloudy.  They may not know what that means, or what it meant to you.  \n\nWe, as a society, don't discuss fertility matters publicly, and often we hide those painful experiences because we don't want to make others uncomfortable.  Likewise, our loved ones won't know what to say, or how to act.  Should we bring it up, or will that upset you?  Should we act like everything is normal?  Nobody knows what to say or do, even if we want to help.\n\nThat's not your fault, either, but if you need to talk, reach out to the people who care about you.  Tell them you are hurting, and give them space to process with you.  If they can't or don't provide what you need, feel free to dm me and we can talk.  I haven't experienced what you went through, but I have some experience with similar issues, and I know how difficult it can be to articulate what you're feeling.", "YWBTA. A big one.", "YWBTA my aunt doesn\u2019t even send me a Christmas card, much less know what\u2019s going on in my day-to-day life. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your losses.", "YWBTA\u2026 you\u2019re saying your family is shit at communicating, yet your solution when you\u2019re hurt by the fact that you received a seemingly well meaning card from your aunt is to plan for a passive-aggressive response instead of calling her, thanking her for thinking of you and then throwing the card away? I think it\u2019s good to read the books you\u2019re recommending to your family\u2026", "YWBTA... You mentioned your family doesn't communicate. So her taking time to send you a card was thoughtful of her. Did you send her anything? Do you know what is going on in her life? Probably not. It happens... Life gets that way sometimes and you have definitely had a tough year, but try not to misdirect it at her. Maybe call her and tell her? n I'm so sorry for your loss...i know how much our furry children mean to us.", "YWBTA. Your first sentence was \u201cmy family is a mess\u201d and you \u201ccommunicate terribly.\u201d This was an opportunity to build a bridge and instead you went a petty route which is probably contributing to the \u201cmess.\u201d This is not a model of good communication.", "YWBTA.\n\n*I want to use a red pen, cross out the 's' in furkids*\n\nCould you not just do this, if the extra 's' upsets you? (And I understand why it does.) Or put a sticker over the extra 's' or something? Or just ...  throw out/recycle the card?\n\nI get why you're upset, it's a reminder of your kitty's absence. It's awful to lose a pet (my cat went to the Rainbow Bridge on April 1st, and I miss him every day).\n\nHowever, I'd bet money that if your aunt went to the trouble of mentioning your pets, she didn't do this with the card to upset you. Also, you say you had to put your cat down 'a few days' before Christmas. My guess is, she prepared/mailed this card before then.\n\nAnyway, crossing out the extra 's' and mailing the card back would be petty, passive-aggressive, and yes, AH-ish. (Not to mention, a waste of postage.) \n\nJust tell her about your situation, or appreciate her intentions and move on.\n\n(That said, in all sincerity, take all the time you need to grieve your cat.)", "YWBTA - just throw it out, no need to act like a teenager about it", "YWBTA. She very well could have written the card and probably mailed it before you had to put the cat down. She didn't do it to make you hurt more. Toss the card, don't do something horrible to lash out. Your grief and anguish doesn't need to be directed to people who didn't cause it.", "YWBTA. It\u2019s going to sound horrible but I\u2019ll be blunt: your life is about you. Your aunt\u2019s life isn\u2019t about you. She\u2019s got her own issues going on. I\u2019m sorry that your furbaby went over the rainbow bridge but sending the card back corrected would be petty and start 2023 in a shitty way.", "YTA such a passive aggressive idea is probably exactly why you have communication issues with your family. It makes me wonder if they are the problem or you are the problem", "Read those books again lol. Sounds like she meant well with the card. If you want to talk about the death of your pet with her, do so in a mature way.", "You said you're not close to your aunt but she was considering enough to send you a card. You don't know what's going on each other's life so she made a small mistake and you want to be petty like  that. If you do this you will never have to worry about getting another card from her again", "Maybe act like an adult and talk to her rather than this oddly passive aggressive response to a situation she wasn\u2019t aware on because she has her own life too\u2026 YTA", "The civil way to do it is to politely thank her for the card, and let her know that your lost one of your companions. YTA.", "YWBTI. \n\nYou know in the Christmas card culture, people often send out dozens and dozens...maybe even hundreds. They often start making them out and addressing them weeks or months in advance and mail them all at once. \n\nMy relatives don't usually keep abreast of my pets lives with the exception of my aunts and uncle and its just the one pet...a dog that belonged to my mother who passed earlier this year. \n\nI'm sorry but not everyone puts pets on equal footing to children. If this had been an actual child, I could see it being wildly insensitive because a child dying tends to be a much bigger topic of discussion in the family. \n\nThrow the card away if it offends you so much.", "Did you tell her you lost your cat?  Was the card sent before that?", "YWBTA and even though it might give you a moment of relief it won\u2019t ease your grief. I am so sorry you have had these losses.", "Well first I must say that is a shitty year, I\u2019m sorry for your many losses. That just sucks.\nNext, onto the question you pose, unfortunately YWBTA for the reasons you already said. You know it, just let it go.", "Sounds like you're having a whopper of a time lately. So sorry for your troubles. \n\nYWBTA if you sent the card back to her. You could try good some positive communication and offer her an olive branch- call and thank her for her card, ask her how she's doing...If it's possible, work into convo that you lost your cat, and maybe the other stressors (but maybe not).", "YTA. I know you're going through a lot, so I don't think you're *an* asshole. But the appropriate thing to do here is to let your aunt know that you feel neglected, not to engage in passive aggressive nonsense (giving people books instead of talking face-to-face about how you're feeling is also pretty passive aggressive). You might even do it in such a way that she doesn't lose face, like, tell her it meant a lot to get a card from her, because you've been having a hard time and have been really lonely.", "YTA and holy shit you sound dramatic. I'm sorry for your loss, but just because you're *\"feral with grief\"* (wtf kinda phrase even is that?) doesn't give you the right to take it out on others. For all you know, it could have been a goddamned typo which happens when you write things. You sound just as bad as your family, but you tried to make yourself out to be better than them.", "YWBTA.  Please don't do that. \n\nI would take this as an olive branch from your aunt and a chance for you to improve communication with this relative who seems to be making an effort. \n\nI'm sorry for your losses this year. Hoping that 2023 will be better.", "YWBTA.", "agreeing with everyone else so far. Yes YWBTA. Family falls apart some times and you cant expect anyone to kniw whats going on in your life without telling them. You honestly sound immature and just need a little time to grow up and figure out what adult life is like. Unless you are a grown adult, them you just need to learn responsibility and grow up.", "I think you'd be more of a dumbass than an asshole.", "YTA \u2014 or you would be if you did this. How would she know your pet died? It sounds like she\u2019s trying to reach out to you. If you are angry with her, address it in an adult way. Don\u2019t get complicated with a stupid corrected card. Just send her an email where you explain your feelings.", "Not only the asshole, but a GIANT asshole. \nGet over yourself - say thanks to your aunt and move the fuck on", "YTA - I get that you're going through shit but there's no reason to punish your aunt for that.  She sent you a card, which means she's trying to be in your life.  If you're not talking to her, how is she to know what you're going through, or that you lost a furkid?  Try sending her a thank you card, a genuine thank you, without jabs or sarcasm.  You might find it easier to have people in your life.", "YWBTA. \n\nPeople have to send Christmas cards in the mail weeks before Christmas for them to arrive in time. If your pet was euthanized \"a few days before Christmas\", your aunt had already signed and sent the card when your pet was still alive. So not only would your reaction be completely unreasonable, in essence your stance wouldn't even be logical, the pet was still alive when she sent the card...\n\n\nAlso, most people do not include any mention of other people's pets on cards, certainly not Christmas cards. You consider it a fault that your aunt didn't know one of your pets died (even though it was probably still alive when she wrote the card) even though like 99% of people never would have bothered to mention any of your pets to begin with. Just saying.\n\n\nI think you should consider utilizing therapy not just for communication issues. The things you list on the bottom of your post is probably why you're upset, but you're using this card from your aunt as a way to direct your anger that's really because of those other reasons. Not a healthy coping system tbh and will really burn bridges for you long term.", "You\u2019ve had an absolute shit year, and I am so so sorry you have to deal with all of that. It\u2019s completely understandable that your emotions are running so hot, but let\u2019s take a deep breath and look at this from another angle. \n\nThe time frame in which you need to look is from the day your baby passed to the postmark on the envelope. It\u2019s within the scope of reason that when your aunt wrote the card your pup was still with us. It\u2019s feasible that even if your family knew how to communicate that the card would say the same thing. \n\nYou are grieving and looking to lash out. This is so human. But still YWBTA. Don\u2019t let this be the hair that clogs the drain.", "Yes ywbta is it possible that she doesn\u2019t know what happened to your pet? And if she does, did she mail the card after your pet died? And even both of those things are true, you can simply just let it go and realize that sometimes mistakes like this happen with no malice intended.", "Maybe she sent it before your furbaby\u2019s death and the post is slow? Look you had a crappy year but taking it out on someone who cared enough to send you a card and mention your furbabies isn\u2019t really fair.", "YWBTA. It sounds like 2022 was a terrible year for you and I\u2019m sorry about that. But your aunt was trying to be nice.  She made a gesture. Throwing it back in her face isn\u2019t going to further your real goal of more and better communication.", "Unless you communicated to your aunt that you lost one of your loves how was she to know? Grief is cruel and makes us do things out of \u201cnormal character\u201d. I know you\u2019re getting some harsh words from them sub, but don\u2019t take it too personally. YWBTA if you sent the card back with \u201ccorrections\u201d; I think a better alternative is to simply throw it away.", "VERY soft YWBTA because to me this feels like a straw that broke the camel\u2019s back situation. OP, I am so sorry for what you\u2019re going through. Losing a beloved pet, your grandfather, and the ability to have kids in such a short period of time is so much to deal with.
