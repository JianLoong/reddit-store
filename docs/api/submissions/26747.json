Quick update for anyone who is interested.\n\nRecap: \nMy parents wanted to put a tracker on my (28F) phone \"for my safety\". I said no and drama ensued. Original post [here](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/GiPGFE6Yfh).\n\nUpdate: \nThings were very frosty the next couple of days. My Mum eventually came to me and said that she was going to address the \"elephant in the room\". She said that she was very disappointed in me but, as I didn't care about her, she will just have to live without it (the tracker on my phone). I think she expected me to cave at that point but I didn't. I said \"thank you for understanding\" and that was it. The car keys were returned to the drawer and nothing more was said about it from anyone (including my Dad). To this day, I have no idea why the 180 degree flip happened. \n\nAlthough you all helped me realise that I have an unhealthy codependant relationship with my parents, I think it will just take time to set boundaries and learn how to be my own person. I still love them a lot and I know they love me too (even though we aren't the type of family that says so).\n\nWhich leads me to my other news...I got the job in London! I have officially moved out and am living there now. It still feels surreal. I know it is going to take some time to get used to living independently but I am ready to be my own person and learn how to do things on my own. Honestly, I had given up hope that this day would ever come. I feel so much happier and can genuinely say I am proud of myself. If anyone has any tips for living away from home for the first time, please let me know! \n\nFinally, thank you for all your support and giving me the push I needed. I was in a very dark place and now feel like I can start living my life. Thank you.", "created_utc": 1694559202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16h5wz8/update_aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_parents_put_a/", "score": 360, "replies": ["NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHAve your car checked for trackers.", "NTA.  \n\n>She said that she was very disappointed in me but, as I didn't care about her, she will just have to live without it (the tracker on my phone).

Check those keys, check your car, and check any/everything you carry around with you on a daily basis.  Tracker apps on phones aren't the only kinds of tracking that's possible.  Physical ones are small enough now to be added into a whole ton of things.  \n\nCongrats on the job, the move, and standing up for yourself.  Best wishes for continued success and growth in your life.", "Congrats on the job!!!!", "They put a tracker in the car. Or your purse.", "Hey! That\u2019s awesome news op! I\u2019m glad your getting out of there and congrats on the job! \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nSo weird to hear a good ending on Reddit, is it my cake day?

They got their tracker, you just didn\u2019t know it.", "Congratulations !  You should get a crackpot and join the reddit cooking group for simple dinner ideas. Good luck with your new job.", "Wonderful news! Enjoy London. This internet stranger is very proud of you.\n\nThe 180 flip probably happened because you politely held your ground. You did not give in, try to change their minds, beg for the car, whine, or otherwise act like their subordinate. This forced them to treat you as a competent independent adult. It was probably the first time they had to acknowledge just how capable you are. Now they know they can't infantilize you, there will be much less trouble. Expect some backsliding if you have a significant other or child, but you've got this. You'll handle it.", "Congrats on the job! And welcome to the rest of your life, outside of your parent\u2019s controlling household!", "Absolutely not the a****** that is a total invasion of privacy", "Honestly that was my guess as well.", "Oh yes. That\u2019s obvious.", "Thank you!", "or they put it on your phone without you knowing. congrats on the move and the job! but please check *everything* for trackers.", "I think you are suggesting she buy a crockpot, a crackpot might be hazardous to her health. Thanks for the laugh.\n\nI just bought my son an Instant Pot, as it is a crockpot (slow cooker), pressure cooker, rice cooker, and yogurt maker all in one. I love mine.\n\nNothing like having a place to yourself, such freedom. Enjoy spending time getting to know yourself better.", "I'm thinking get a new phone to use everyday and just call the parentals on the old phone when needed/wanted.\n\nCongrats OP!!!!!!", "Glad you stuck it out and got to London.  I hope you have a wonderful life...\n\n...but hire a security service to check everything of yours for bugs and trackers.  Just in case.", "One of two things happened:\n\n1) she was expecting that little \"you clearly don't care about me so it's fine\" manipulation to work i.e. get you to allow the tracker to \"prove\" that you do care\n\n2) she put a tracker on your car\n\nThe second one is most likely, so if you're still driving that car you need to do a sweep for trackers ASAP.\n\nI get that getting away from abusive parents is hard, and will take time. My mom was damn near 70 when she finally accepted that what she experienced from her own mother wasn't love. I hope it doesn't take you nearly as long OP, and good luck on everything moving forward.", "I would bet a whole lot of money they put a tracker in your car. There's a function on most phones that will notify you if any tracker is placed near you and I STRONGLY suggest you turn it on.\n\nControlling, manipulative people don't just change like that.\n\nNTA", "Go to London. \n\nPut your parents on an information diet about your plans, otherwise they might sabotage you.\n\nGet someone to make a security sweep of your car and maybe your other electronic belongings. If you find some, deactivate them when you leave.", "Have you made sure they didn't put a tracker on your car, or something else? That would explain the 180 degree change...", "First apartment city living - charity shops, Portebello Road, junk shops. If there's a freecycle sometimes you can get great stuff. Older dressers and tables are generally solid wood which lasts much better than ikea.\nIf you are a college graduate, see if there are any alumni groups in the city so you can meet up with like-minded people.\nWhere I live, there are \"First Fridays\" where museums are cheap or free on Friday nights, and there's usually interesting people to meet with.\nBookclubs are often listed at libraries or bookshops and can introduce you to folks in the neighborhood.\nAs a woman, use a cross-body bag to lessen the chance of pickpockets. Don't dump a handbag on the ground or across your chair at a restaurant or bar. Be aware of your surroundings. Perhaps take a self-defense class to have some notions on how to protect yourself and avoid being a victim - even if it's only YouTube.\nLondon is a fun city, but city living has some caveats. Live big and laugh often :)", "Congratulations - that is a really awesome update. You will thrive there.\n\nPlease get your car swept for a tracking device - I just have this gut feeling that the 180 degree change in attitude from your parents was not what it seemed on the surface.", "I'm glad things worked out for you. But do not give them keys to your new place. Do not give them the details of your daily schedule. Put them on an information diet; only tell them what they need to know. And like the others said, check for trackers on your car and your phone.", "Congrats! Independent living is great, once you get used to it.\n\nOnce you've found the tracker they put on the car, don't deactivate it. Put it on the back of a bus.", "Congrats on the job and your new life, like the rest of the comment said check out any trackers!\nLearn some self-defense, join some meetups when possible, but most importantly take everything at your own pace.\n\nFrom someone that had to learn to be independent at a later age as well! Good luck! \ud83d\udc4d", "So glad you got out of the situation OP. Congratulations on the job!!", "...Do your parents have you on their phone plan?\n\nI've heard that it's possible for parents to activate location sharing through their service provider. There are ways to detect it on your end, so if anything seems weird with your phone just be aware.\n\n\nIn any case, congrats and enjoy your newfound freedom!!! London is lovely and I hope you enjoy it and your new life :)", "I moved from my home country to London when I was your age. Amazingly, it was much easier living in London on my own than living at home with other people, because I did not need to take care of anyone other than myself.\n\nThings I did that I would do again:\n\n* lots of solo travel around the UK and a bit in Europe\n* If I was feeling isolated I went to the cinema\n* clothes shopping (I had hardly done that previously)\n* joined my local library\n\nThings I would do with the benefit of hindsight:\n\n* join some clubs, e.g. board games, a knitting group, maybe a social meet up activity group aimed at 25-35, maybe a gym with classes, or indoor climbing. Look online for your interests in your area.\n* mixed with the ex-pat community from my home country\n\nCongratulations on the job! You will be absolutely fine in London.", "NTA\n\n>To this day, I have no idea why the 180 degree flip happened.\n\nThey likely talked to family and friends (and the consensus wasn't in their favor) that pointed out you are an adult and have been for several years and they didn't really have a need or right to put a tracker on you phone.", "I'm so happy for you good luck op", "Congratulations! Such an adventure you're on! There are a lot of things you may need to learn how to do now that you are on your own but there are youtube videos on how to do darn near everything from baking a cake to changing a light bulb. I used a youtube video to learn how to smooth down the buttercream icing on the wedding cake I was making for my son and DIL. It turned out great. Good luck on your new life!", "Enjoy London :) this is going to be cliche as hell, but I do recommend the London lonely girls Facebook group, I've joined a board games meet up from there and it's just nice to meet up with new like minded people. Second what someone said about a Crockpot/slow cooker, super convenient.", "Check the phone and the car for tracking devices and software. If the keys have a little tag on them it could be a locator to \"find your keys\".\n\nCome over to [Home Defense](https://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/) if you would like advice for securing your new home. Since you can't own a gun having robust security is even more important.", "They didn\u2019t come to their senses, they just found a way to spy on you without your consent. I don\u2019t know if they put cameras in your house or trackers in your car or all of the above. They might have put a Tile or Chipolo in something that you always carry. You need to start searching your stuff, sorry :(", "That\u2019s amazing about the job!! Your parents sound suffocating, I\u2019m happy that you have an escape", "I concur you should search your car for trackers but if you find one then leave it in place till you move out. Then show it to your parents, demand an explanation and go LC as a boundary statement \n\nNTA", "Noe, block them. Also check for car trackers", "NTA, nice to hear", "Her car in London, where her parents have never been?", "YUP", "This is nuts!  Op is almost 30?!   I didnt read the original post \nBest of luck!!", "Or in the back of your neck, like agent Scully.\n\nNTA", "Or both", "This is such a helpful post. Thank you kind Redditor \ud83d\ude0a", "Considering OP's dad called her a \"stupid bitch\" when she didn't agree to the tracker, I highly doubt they even asked outside parties. These people are committed to the manipulation, they wouldn't take being told they're wrong so graciously.", "No, they decided to put a tracker on her phone or her car or a bunch of other places against her will and behind her back.", "That would absolutely not stop them.", "I don\u2019t see where she said that she got a new car, it reads to me like her father returned the car that he was letting OP use.\n\nBut yes they are guaranteed somehow tracking her, hiring a private detective to watch her, or some other unhinged behavior. Insecurities like this don\u2019t evaporate and solve themselves.", "Have your car checked as soon as possible. They could put a tracker on that without you knowing or asking.\n\nhave your clothes and purse etc checked as well and thorougly.", "Both is definitely likely.", "I have an instant pot too! Auto correct got me again.   I thought that the crock pot would be easier to use. The instant pot is a better suggestion.", "Yeah, it does have that vibe", "It really would. How do you put a tracker on a car that's in another continent that you are ? Assuming here that OP didn't stuff her US car in her luggage. Plus chances are that living in London, she doesn't own a car.", "My money is on an airtag or multiple airtags.", "Considering OP consistently calls their mom \"mum\", I'm guessing she moved to London from a different part of the UK, not the US. Definitely still reasonable to believe she brought her car with her."]}
