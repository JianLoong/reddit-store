Quick update for anyone who is interested.\n\nRecap: \nMy parents wanted to put a tracker on my (28F) phone \"for my safety\". I said no and drama ensued. Original post [here](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/GiPGFE6Yfh).\n\nUpdate: \nThings were very frosty the next couple of days. My Mum eventually came to me and said that she was going to address the \"elephant in the room\". She said that she was very disappointed in me but, as I didn't care about her, she will just have to live without it (the tracker on my phone). I think she expected me to cave at that point but I didn't. I said \"thank you for understanding\" and that was it. The car keys were returned to the drawer and nothing more was said about it from anyone (including my Dad). To this day, I have no idea why the 180 degree flip happened. \n\nAlthough you all helped me realise that I have an unhealthy codependant relationship with my parents, I think it will just take time to set boundaries and learn how to be my own person. I still love them a lot and I know they love me too (even though we aren't the type of family that says so).\n\nWhich leads me to my other news...I got the job in London! I have officially moved out and am living there now. It still feels surreal. I know it is going to take some time to get used to living independently but I am ready to be my own person and learn how to do things on my own. Honestly, I had given up hope that this day would ever come. I feel so much happier and can genuinely say I am proud of myself. If anyone has any tips for living away from home for the first time, please let me know! \n\nFinally, thank you for all your support and giving me the push I needed. I was in a very dark place and now feel like I can start living my life.

Check those keys, check your car, and check any/everything you carry around with you on a daily basis.  Tracker apps on phones aren't the only kinds of tracking that's possible.  Physical ones are small enough now to be added into a whole ton of things.  \n\nCongrats on the job, the move, and standing up for yourself.

Good luck with your new job.", "Wonderful news! Enjoy London. This internet stranger is very proud of you.\n\nThe 180 flip probably happened because you politely held your ground. You did not give in, try to change their minds, beg for the car, whine, or otherwise act like their subordinate. This forced them to treat you as a competent independent adult. It was probably the first time they had to acknowledge just how capable you are. Now they know they can't infantilize you, there will be much less trouble. Expect some backsliding if you have a significant other or child, but you've got this. You'll handle it.", "Congrats on the job! And welcome to the rest of your life, outside of your parent\u2019s controlling household!", "Absolutely not the a****** that is a total invasion of privacy", "Honestly that was my guess as well.", "Oh yes. That\u2019s obvious.", "Thank you!", "or they put it on your phone without you knowing. congrats on the move and the job! but please check *everything* for trackers.", "I think you are suggesting she buy a crockpot, a crackpot might be hazardous to her health. Thanks for the laugh.\n\nI just bought my son an Instant Pot, as it is a crockpot (slow cooker), pressure cooker, rice cooker, and yogurt maker all in one. I love mine.\n\nNothing like having a place to yourself, such freedom. Enjoy spending time getting to know yourself better.", "I'm thinking get a new phone to use everyday and just call the parentals on the old phone when needed/wanted.\n\nCongrats OP!!!!!!"]}
