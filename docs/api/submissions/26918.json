I said no because I bought this ice cream for myself as a treat and if they wanted they would have to buy from me, so they ran to my dad and begged him for money. My dad gave them and they took a scoop of ice cream. \n\nWhen my mom came home and heard what happened, she called me stupid and said that it was a really dumb thing to do because how on earth can I eat ice cream in front of little kids and not share.
