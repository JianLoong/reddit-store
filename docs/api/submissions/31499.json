I am NOT a professional I just have a good grasp of aesthetics and know a lot of people in the local area so my friends ask or I offer to help with party/event planning sometimes. \n\nAbout 6 weeks ago I got a call from Issy, asking me to be her maid of honour. I was very surprised because we don\u2019t each other well, and my calendar in the early part of the year is so hectic I really don\u2019t have time. I was upfront with her about this, telling her how flattered I was and that I would be happy to be a bridesmaid if she wanted but I just wasn\u2019t able to take on moh responsibilities. Issue was annoyed about this and admitted she had expected that I would accept being moh and offer to plan the wedding with her, since I had for my cousin previously and bf\u2019s sister. I said again that if she wanted me to be a bridesmaid I\u2019d happily do that but I wasn\u2019t going to plan her wedding or associated events. She begrudgingly accepted this but I had a feeling when it came time to officially have bridesmaid I wouldn\u2019t be one, which is fine. JC never brought this up so I thought no more about it. \n\nA couple of days ago, I got a call from the event coordinator of a hotel I\u2019ve used for events in the past. This person had questions about my wedding requirements. I was confused obviously. It transpired that Issy had called this hotel and used to my name to get an appointment with the coordinator, and then further dropped my name to try to secure a sizeable discount, saying that I was involved in planning the wedding. I was mortified.\n\nOn a hunch, I called the owner of the restaurant where I held my parents\u2019 anniversary party to ask if he\u2019d had any contact about an event I\u2019m planning. He had. Again, Issy had called about hosting a bridal shower, again asking for a discount based on my name. \n\nI called Issy and said she had a nerve to be touting my name around, embarrassing me in front of people I know and work with, all without my knowledge. We argued. Issy said it shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to mention me, since I wouldn\u2019t help her it\u2019s the least I could do, to which I said not when you try to lowball my contacts and don\u2019t even ask me if I\u2019m okay with you using me as a contact. The argument went on until I called her an entitled bridezilla and hung up. \n\nJC says I shouldn\u2019t have said that to her and just let the venues tell her no on their own but I think it\u2019s nuts that she feels entitled to use my name and then run it through the mud with people who have really helped me in the past.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1700663492, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181afp3/aita_for_calling_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_an_entitled/", "score": 3218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hotels and restaurants get people trying to lowball them all the time, especially for weddings, and people will use any trick that they think they can come up with to try to drive the price down. If she was asking for insultingly low discounts, I would think that any experienced vendor would be able to see a mile away that this is not a person you would actually be dealing with. And if they were concerned that you were dealing with her, they would do like the hotel did and call you up to feel the situation out. Because if you\u2019re going to call in a major discount, one would expect that the contact themselves will be making the call, and not just a name dropper.
