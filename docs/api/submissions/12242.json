Both of our families were lower middle class, so neither of us were well off. Both sets of parents grew up in poverty. Yet, each of our parents then chose to raise us differently. Kelsey\u2019s mom decided that Kelsey was going to work for every single thing she got. She made Kelsey get a part time job at 16, started charging her rent at 18 and expected her out of the house by the time she graduated college.  \n\nMy parents encouraged me and my brother to get jobs when we were teenagers, but they were very lenient on what that could be. I babysat every other weekend. My brother (now 21M) worked about 10 hours a week at a small business. They refused to accept rent once we were 18, even though we offered numerous times. On top of that, they made it clear we could live with them as long as we wanted. We help around the house, will buy groceries/dinner often, etc. But we are encouraged to save our money. I currently work a full time job related to my major, my brother is in college and works part time.\n\n I know a lot of people who were raised the way Kelsey was and they turned out great. Kelsey is a very hard worker and has good life skills. I would also argue that I am the same way. However, Kelsey's mom is very critical, leading to Kelsey always being afraid of disappointing her. Meanwhile, my parents have always emotionally supported me, even if I mess up.\n\nI don\u2019t often bring up my upbringing, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important. However, Kelsey is obviously aware I live at home. She once asked how much I paid in rent and when I said nothing, she called me spoiled. I would never argue that I don\u2019t have privilege given my upbringing. However, it irritates me that Kelsey somehow views this as a bad thing. I have never criticized her mother\u2019s parenting because again, different strokes for different folks and all that. I just try to change the subject or tune Kelsey out.\n\nRecently, a local paper ran an article about how many adults still live at home and cited the reason being inflation. Kelsey scoffed at this and said that she would never let her kids live at home past 22. I said that given how things are now and the way I predict they\u2019ll be in the future, I wouldn\u2019t rush my kids out of the house. Kelsey gave me a Look and said \u201cYou would say that\u201d. I said we were entitled to different opinions. She went on another rant about how my parents spoiled me. She then made a comment about how I talk to my mom. We often joke around, trade jabs, etc. Kelsey said she would never talk to her mom that way.\n\nI was fed up and said \u201cMy parents respect me and I do them. At least I\u2019m not worried if I make a mistake, they\u2019ll stop supporting me emotionally.\u201d Kelsey got quiet and left a few minutes later. She eventually texted me and said I went too far, bringing up her insecurities. But I don\u2019t know. I feel it\u2019s fair game when she kept trying to make me feel bad about my upbringing.

I pity her, I hope she can see through it and process the pain she is currently glorifying as a way to protect her ego. \n\nI think you should have a conversation with her and ask her, really, if she would honestly consider doing to her potential kids what her parents did to her?

You retaliated to her provocation, which is understandable, but not great emotional control. It seems Kelsey is jealous of the fact that she has to pay rent and you do not. Perhaps, a bit jealous of your parents and they way they supported you. (I mean the encouragement and love, not just the money.)\n\nIt\u2019s not great to attack someone, even when they\u2019re being awful, so a better choice would have been to walk away before you made the comment about her parents being not so supportive. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal: if you want to continue this friendship, then you will most likely need to be aware that she is jealous of the amount of emotional and financial support your parents give you, and you must be sensitive about that to avoid further conflicts. \n\nIf you decide Kelsey isn\u2019t worth you having to tip-toe around certain subjects, then behave without thinking about her at all, and I\u2019m sure in a short amount of time, she or you will say something unforgivable that will cause the friendship to naturally dissolve.  \n\nWhat to consider: she may be struggling to make it, as her parents \u201cpull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps\u201d style of parenting isn\u2019t working for her as well as she wants it to. She sees what your parents have done for you as extra benefits, and thus the \u201cspoiled\u201d comments. If you decide you really like her and want to help her out, you can confront the next awful comment straight on and say, \u201cthat\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve called me spoiled, what was it like in your house?\u201d And when she tells you, say \u201cwow. That sounds really hard, especially in this economy. I\u2019m sorry your parents haven\u2019t been more supportive of you.\u201d And maybe encourage her to get into a group, or reach out to more friends, or whatever. \n\nThe choice is yours. You are not a bad person if you want to leave this friendship and move on with someone who doesn\u2019t have these issues. But I will caution you that everyone has some sort of issues, the trick in relationships is to find the people whose issues don\u2019t mix with your issues and cause explosive damage.", "Aaargh. Forget about a judgement. May I encourage you to try to find a more empathetic response to Kelsey? It could do a world of good for her and give you both a much better friendship.\n\n1. As a parent, I can't help but like you. You love, respect, and appreciate your parents. You have good values, a good work ethic, and respect for the value of money (and don't feel too entitled to your parents' money). You have compassion and respect for you friend.\n2. Your friend was judgmental and critical with you, but she's been brow-beaten by her mom for most of her life. Her mom heaps judgement and criticism on her. Kelsey is parroting the life-views her mom has taught her.\n3. When Kelsey heaped judgement and criticism on you, she made herself fair game for a biting remark from you. What you said was the truth. But. What if you had spoken the same truth with compassion instead of as a come-back?\n4. Granted, it takes a lot of time to come up with thoughtful words; it's not that easy. Now that you are thinking about it, what if you said to Kelsey: \"*I know both your mom and my parents want to help us transition to independence, and I think we are both doing a pretty good job of becoming independent even if how we are getting there is a little different. I feel very lucky that my parents respect me and champion me. I wish that you could hear more of that from your mom. There's a lot of good in letting your kid know you are proud of her, that you are cheering for her. I think you have a lot to be proud of, and I think I do, too. We aren't in a competition. There isn't only one way to become independent and self-sufficient. What if we just cheered for each other?*\"\n5. You didn't really slam her mom (and none of us know what life path shaped her mom), but you acknowledged that hole in Kelsey's parental support in a compassionate way. And then you gave Kelsey some of that praise she is missing and asked to be allies. Hopefully, Kelsey would respond positively to that. It might even encourage her to acknowledge what she's missing from her mom. If she doesn't respond positively and persists in being critical/judgmental of you, then, of course, you don't have to take it. But I think it's worth at least a try from you.", "NTA\n\nEr no...she thought she could mock you persistently and not expect you to shut her down.   She went there and you finished it.  Give her space and reflect if you want to be treated in this manner.  Respect is a two way street.", "NTA cut off her. She is not friend", "I came here to say this lol", "WTF does tone have to do with this?", "No, good friendships generally don't end cos you snapped back after continued barbs. People learn boundaries. Op shouldn't have to keep walking on eggshells around this friend. This is her boundary. Friendship is a 2 way street. Her friend will learn or they move on.", "If OP is feeling guilty apologize JUST FOR TONE AKA DELIVERY OOF SAID WORDS NOT THE WORDS THEMSELVES.  and then look expectantly for Kelsy(?) to return the apology in kind with similar intent .", "Because Kelsey keeps mentioning it? Is OP supposed to never respond?", "The point is to be able to have a respectful discussion, not that they should be agreeing on their parenting styles. How about you acknowledge that you misread the situation and stop being abrasive for no reason.", "They are both assholes. \n\nOP continually brings up articles and perpetuates her way is the way. They both do. \n\nMeh! I\u2019m not being abrasive. I just think they are both 24 year olds acting like assholes. Hence my rating"]}
