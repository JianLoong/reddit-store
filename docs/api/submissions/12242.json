Both of our families were lower middle class, so neither of us were well off. Both sets of parents grew up in poverty. Yet, each of our parents then chose to raise us differently. Kelsey\u2019s mom decided that Kelsey was going to work for every single thing she got. She made Kelsey get a part time job at 16, started charging her rent at 18 and expected her out of the house by the time she graduated college.  \n\nMy parents encouraged me and my brother to get jobs when we were teenagers, but they were very lenient on what that could be. I babysat every other weekend. My brother (now 21M) worked about 10 hours a week at a small business. They refused to accept rent once we were 18, even though we offered numerous times. On top of that, they made it clear we could live with them as long as we wanted. We help around the house, will buy groceries/dinner often, etc. But we are encouraged to save our money. I currently work a full time job related to my major, my brother is in college and works part time.\n\n I know a lot of people who were raised the way Kelsey was and they turned out great. Kelsey is a very hard worker and has good life skills. I would also argue that I am the same way. However, Kelsey's mom is very critical, leading to Kelsey always being afraid of disappointing her. Meanwhile, my parents have always emotionally supported me, even if I mess up.\n\nI don\u2019t often bring up my upbringing, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important. However, Kelsey is obviously aware I live at home. She once asked how much I paid in rent and when I said nothing, she called me spoiled. I would never argue that I don\u2019t have privilege given my upbringing. However, it irritates me that Kelsey somehow views this as a bad thing. I have never criticized her mother\u2019s parenting because again, different strokes for different folks and all that. I just try to change the subject or tune Kelsey out.\n\nRecently, a local paper ran an article about how many adults still live at home and cited the reason being inflation. Kelsey scoffed at this and said that she would never let her kids live at home past 22. I said that given how things are now and the way I predict they\u2019ll be in the future, I wouldn\u2019t rush my kids out of the house. Kelsey gave me a Look and said \u201cYou would say that\u201d. I said we were entitled to different opinions. She went on another rant about how my parents spoiled me. She then made a comment about how I talk to my mom. We often joke around, trade jabs, etc. Kelsey said she would never talk to her mom that way.\n\nI was fed up and said \u201cMy parents respect me and I do them. At least I\u2019m not worried if I make a mistake, they\u2019ll stop supporting me emotionally.\u201d Kelsey got quiet and left a few minutes later. She eventually texted me and said I went too far, bringing up her insecurities. But I don\u2019t know. I feel it\u2019s fair game when she kept trying to make me feel bad about my upbringing.

If someone is willing to comment on your upbringing and your relationship with your parents, they shouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear the same comments back. Kelsey is unwilling to self reflect and see her own insecurities, so she takes it out on others.", "Nta. She's bullying you", "NTA\n\nYou tried to change the subject and she didn't let off.\n\nIt's not your fault she doesn't have a good relationship with her mother. She can take that money she's making, get therapy, and not try to become her worse enemy.", "NTA. Kelsey dragged you into this conversation so she had it coming. Don\u2019t feel bad.", "NTA. She sounds very jealous. She probably wishes she had the upbringing you had and the option to live with her parents for free. She needs to mind her own business and respect you and your family\u2019s choices and beliefs.", "Nta, sometimes you need to speak up even if it is with your friend.", "NTA. Kelsey was taking out her insecurities regarding her mother on you.", "NTA\n\nBut I would apologise, and point out that you were responding in kind. Tell her that you don\u2019t appreciate how often she comments to pass judgement on your living and family situation and that if she wants you not to do that to her, she needs to stop doing that to you.", "NTA.  It wasn't the kindest thing to do, but you were pushed over the edge and being bullied.  Sounds like Kelsey is jealous of how you were raised and the amazing relationship you have with your parents.", "ESH. She started it and you retaliated.", "ESH \n\nYour both 24 and making excuses in life for how your parents raised you!\n\nYou\u2019re both adults but are having childish arguments. \n\nYou both need to grow up", "ESH\n\nShe should have never went there herself..she is showing her jealousy.
