Dont take a shit in your own bed? Or something like that? He is taking his work home and ramping it up to extreme levels. He is going to end up ostracized and going down a dark path.", "NTA; I have had this happen with friends and family. Your cop cousin is technically breaking laws attempting to uphold others.

Your cousin is a pig and cutting him loose is the right move.", "This is one of those people that shouldn't be a cop. Too many of them are on the force for the high of the power trip, not to actually serve and protect the people.

Someone should recommend he be tested randomly.", "Fuck you too", "Once invited in, he can legally look at anything that\u2019s in plain view. If he smells weed or sees any sign of contraband he can then do a search. \nPolice got too much power even when off duty", "Incredibly wrong. Smell alone if probable cause, cannabis is known to have a strong smell so even if he doesn't smell anything it's an easy believable excuse. Plenty of Jury members would not hesitate to convict. No reason to take the risk. Cousin wanted to be Officer, that's respectable. However, going out of his way to harass friends and family for victimless crimes? Ban him from all future events.", "Yeah, exactly. They leave it on the kitchen table, then okay. But in a closet or a drawer in their bedroom, no, that is an illegal search. Because he had to search. I think it is horrible for him to be doing that, especially looking into people's cars. But hopefully no one is dumb enough to leave a baggie sitting on the passenger seat", "More like an Indian cop.", "If only any of his friends had a picture of him partaking in an illegal narcotic. Unfortunately teens don\u2019t at all pose for such pictures.. /s", "Thanks dude!", "Honestly, his behaviour is junkie behaviour.

It's my birthday so we'll see how it goes!", "Many happy returns! I hope you find an asshole to enthuse over", "I was hoping it was you, but you seem like a decent person."]}
