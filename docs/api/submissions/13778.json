Why would you hang out with a cop if you know he's arrested his own friends for *weed*. Weed is illegal where I live too, but the cops aren't going to arrest you for it. That's a ticket if they do anything.", "NTA. Under most other conditions that would be different. But let\u2019s be honest. He\u2019s in cop mode even in thanks giving cause\u2026 he wants to potentially bust and arrest his own family? Even if you weren\u2019t smoking weed that\u2019s just uncomfortable.
