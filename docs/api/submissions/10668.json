I live in an area where there isn't a lot of people with my hair texture around, and if there are, they usually don't wear it in the same styles that I do on an every day basis. Because of that I do my hair care at home. \n\nSince moving I've made some friends, and in this group of friends I'm the only person with curly-coily hair. I do occasionally complain about having to drive 2 hrs if I want to get my hair done, and one of my friends \"Sarah\" (not her real name obviously) asked me to bring her a coffee since I was right near the salon she was getting her hair done at. \n\nI went in to give it to her and chatted with her for a minute but was planning to leave right after that since I don't want to get in the way. Sarah and her hair stylist have known each other for a while and the stylist asked if they could do my hair while Sarah's hair was processing because they'd never had an opportunity to work on my hair style before. \n\nI politely declined, telling them I'm not sure that's a good idea. She asked again, hinting at other stylists not being able to learn unless someone gives them a chance. Totally understandable, but I'm sure there's someone out there willing to do it- it just aint me. \n\nThe third time she asked, she started doing that hair stylist grabby hand motion on hair and pulling feeling the ends. I pulled away and said \"Seriously, I'm good, but thanks. Maybe another time.\" \n\nShe asked again, offering to do it for free, and I said I wasnt going to pay you to play around in my hair but really, I'm very specific about my curls so please drop it. She finally backed off and went to rinse my friends hair. \n\nI was texting Sarah and telling her how weird that whole thing was and I guess the sylist was looking at her phone and saw our messages, and she asked us both to leave before finishing Sarah's hair, and still had her pay for part of the service. \n\nSarah's mad and saying I could have just given her a chance instead of making her feel bad, but how is telling her she cant do my hair making her feel bad? She has no experience with my hair type at all, like not even wavy hair, and practice should start with wigs or something not people. And especially not randomly with no consultation or idea of what I would want. \n\nShe's kind of icing me out and its been over a day since she last responded to a text. Am I really in the wrong here? If so, I don't mind apologizing, but I really dont think I did or said anything wrong. The texts weren't even bad, it was just me saying that she didn't know how to take no for an answer and joking about if this was what peer pressure felt like.", "created_utc": 1677093245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1198dco/aita_for_not_allowing_a_hairstylist_to_experiment/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is the chance of them remembering anything about how to work with it by the time the next person with that hair walks in?\n\nI'm not sure why they needed to be told \"no\" so many times, this is pretty unprofessional behaviour, as is kicking your friend out of the salon before even finishing the job.

Boundaries should be respected, they weren\u2019t. Your \u201cfriend\u201d doesn\u2019t see the problem with her reaction either. Everyone is TA bar you.

People deserve to know what they are like.", "NTA, not at all.\n\nJust as general knowledge for anyone who wants to know, the way I've usually seen this work is that the hairstylist puts out a 'model call' with a description of what they want to do. So it might say that they want to practice with a new line of fashion color hair dye and the model has to agree to have their hair dyed into a rainbow of colors. In exchange for their time (and possibly posing for social media photos), the service is free. If something goes wrong (the dye doesn't take, for example) the stylist will fix it before sending the model on their way so they don't leave the session looking a mess. \n\nIf this stylist wants to get more experience with curly-coily hair styles, they could have put out a model call and gotten a model that *wants* to have someone doing their hair and is okay with knowing that the stylist isn't an expert in their hair type. And the stylist knows that, they just wanted to take credit for the work OP put into their hair to keep it looking amazing.", "NTA\n\nPersonal boundaries extend to hair.

I have a particular stylist who works with my hair. I like the way my hair is, I like how it looks. I have had friends in beauty school ask if they can practice on my hair. The answer is always no.\n\nI have had people ask to do my hair. The answer is no. \n\nSome people are okay with their look changing all the time.

As a fellow curly haired person (3b-c), I am 100% on your side.  Caring for curls is like caring for an exotic pet with claws, you gotta treat them just right, or they go feral on you. I would never, ever let a stylist with zero curl experience touch my hair.  With that said, that stylist was way out of line. You are not a test subject for her to experiment on. You told her \"no,\" and that should have ended it.\n\n The fact that your friend didn't say anything to the stylist about leaving you alone is concerning. She could have stepped in, she also could have waited to check her messages.", "NTA and i would also write a review about this awful salon an the way you were both treated that is not okay.", "No is a complete sentence. She\u2019s not familiar with your hair type so no I wouldn\u2019t let her do my hair either.

Whether it is professional classes. Whether it is working with the salon to do a reach out program for free or reduced cost hair treatments in exchange for stylists basically getting to practice on them.\n\nWhatever.\n\nBut she doesn't get to try to badger you into being her guinea pig and she doesn't get to be mad at your friend that you called her out on her poor behavior.", "Good lord! Of course you're NTA! \n\nThe stylist was way out of line to keep badgering you to let her experiment on your hair. No means no. Then she refused to complete what your friend was paying for, because she got mad at *you* (?!?) when she <checks notes> *read a client's phone* and didn't like what she saw. \n\nHoly moly, that's unreal!", "NTA, but it also sounds like your friend set you up here, and you might want to ask about that. Not cool of her at all.", "NTA \n\nIf you are Black, mixed race or a person of colour, and Sarah is being cold towards you because you rightly didn't allow her stylist's microaggressions towards you, then Sarah is not a good friend and is only concerned about not being able to get *her* hair done at *her* salon. \n\nShe doesn't care about your hair, or that this stylist would've butchered it. I advise you to ditch Sarah as it doesn't sound like she cares about your wellbeing, only about how your refusal negatively impacted her. She'd probably defend the stylist if you let her loose on your hair and she ruined it.\n\nYou can make a formal complaint to the salon about this stylist's completely unprofessional behaviour if you want to take it further. Any good stylist should know they should practice on real hair mannequins before getting within sniffing distance of an actual human being's hair. If this woman wants to learn about doing your type of hair she can go back to beauty school and buy her own mannequins to practise on.\n\nHer sense of entitlement to your hair is outrageous. If this were the UK, her grabbing your hair could be classed as a common assault. She had no right whatsoever to touch any part of you. Her conduct and attitude was, quite frankly, disgusting.", "On man, so NTA. I just finished reading some articles about Black hair and how it needs very particular care because it can be so easily damaged. You do not need someone using you to \"experiment\" on. God knows what she might have done. The stylist should have stepped back after the first \"no\" and not continued to harass you. She should also have been more professional than and finished your friend's hair. She was TA. You were not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
