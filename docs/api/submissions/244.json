{"id": 244, "submission_id": "yj2vw2", "title": "AITA for cutting my holiday short and leaving my friend alone in a foreign country for 24h?", "selftext": "Me (45F) and 2 close girlfriends (Cathy -62 and Lisa -45) had been planning a girls-only island getaway for several months.\n\nLisa and I are both globetrotters and travel frequently,  while Cathy had never before taken a plane! This trip was a huge deal for her, first time taking a flight ! \n\nSo we finally found the right dates and booked everything. Lisa ended up not getting her full time-off request granted by her boss, so she could only stay 2 nights /3 full days instead of 3 nights. No problem,  Cathy and I would stay 3 nights as planned. \n\nMonths went by, and during this time I met my new fianc\u00e9.\n\n 2 days before the scheduled holiday,  my fianc\u00e9 encountered a serious problem and needed my assistance (specifically on the weds evening). He asked me to come back a day early,  and we searched for an alternative solution but couldn't figure out any other way to resolve his problem that didn't involve cutting my holiday short or him losing a lot of money. He was really stressed out and worried  and the problem was costing him a lot of money with each passing day. \n\nSo I accepted to shorten my holiday, and booked an earlier return flight, and when I informed Cathy that she would be alone for the last night + half day and return flight, she got really upset.\n\nCathy basically said that she didn't want to go on the trip any longer because her being alone for 1 night wasn't part of the deal.  She demanded that I reimburse her non refundable tickets!\n\nI said that was out of the question, that I owed her nothing and nothing would prevent her from enjoying this long awaited trip,  it was just a minor detail that she would be alone the last day. The fact that I was leaving early had no financial consequences for her, as i was still paying for my share of the airbnb as agreed even though I wouldn't be staying there the last night. I even told Cathy that I would still arrange to pick her up from the airport on the Thursday night. Cathy is a grown woman and there was no reason for me to be concerned about \"abandoning\" her, she spoke the language of the country, and although she is a very inexperienced traveler, she has plenty of common sense. \n\nAfter a lot of guilt tripping (because I basically chose my man over her) and tense discussion,  Cathy finally agreed to come on the trip after all. We had a good time all 3 of us together and Cathy did great on her solo return flight.\n\nMost importantly,  my fianc\u00e9 resolved his problem and I was there for a crucial part of that, I'm not sorry for cutting my holiday short,  it was unfortunate but not a catastrophe. \n\nDespite the relatively good outcome, there is now a strain on my relationship with Cathy. It's been 2 weeks now and she still brings up my \"betrayal\" and berates my choices in front of her children and other friends. \n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1667291078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj2vw2/aita_for_cutting_my_holiday_short_and_leaving_my/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In general, you need to honor your commitments.\n\nI'm not afraid to spend a night or fly alone but I would be irritated if someone planned a vacation with me but then decided to leave early after I already  bought my tickets. On the other hand, emergencies happen. It all depends on what you canceled for.", "I\u2019m confused. You needed to cut the trip short before you were on the trip? You say Cathy eventually still decided to go on the trip, meaning you weren\u2019t on it yet. So your fianc\u00e9 would have a future problem? And clearly he didn\u2019t actually need you to fix it as it got fixed without you. \n\nYTA as this doesn\u2019t add up so I think there\u2019s something you\u2019re excluding. \nYes, Cathy could probably manage for half a day but she\u2019s an inexperienced traveller so it was probably extremely daunting for her. You don\u2019t get to dictate what will distress another person. I\u2019d have hated that too.", "I am highly sceptical that the issue with your fiance is legit tbh How convenient that he had a massive problem that could only be resolved by you? \n\nGoing with ESH\n\nAs an adult she should have been capable... but dipping out the day before and conveniently.leaving with your other fried...makes you a pretty shitty friend.", "YTA\n\nYou made a commitment and I know shit happens in life, but really you and ONLY YOU were able to help your fiance?  I don't believe it.  You bailed on 33% of your vacation.  I'd be pissed too if it was the first time traveling.", "NTA emergencies happen, your friend is a capable adult who spoke the language, and everything worked out fine.  She\u2019s the ass for continuing to bring it up.  Whatever the situation is, you and your fianc\u00e9 determined it was worth more to cut your trip short to solve it, it\u2019s really none of anyone\u2019s business what that issue was if you don\u2019t feel like disclosing.  Kathy is an adult and needs to accept shit sometimes happens.", "You put your fianc\u00e9's MONEY over your friendship. YTA\n\nAlso, what future problem could a man you're not married to have that only you can fix, in person? Are you business partners?", "Info: really need to know more about your fiance's problem and how you help him", "YTA So you had this trip planned, and during the months leading up to your trip, you MET someone and now you're ENGAGED. Then he has some emergency pop up--but two days in advance!--that ONLY YOU can help with. This entire story is bonkers, yeah of course your friend is mad. You put someone you've known for a matter of months over a long time friendship.", "This story doesn't make sense. How could you have an emergency that you knew ahead of time and why could only you help your fiance?", "YTA. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 had no friend or acquaintance that he could ask more than the woman he\u2019s known for a few months? And the issue is fine for you to be away for 2 days but crucial for the evening of day 3? Not buying it with the level of avoidance in your story.", "Well you've all gone straight to the very heart of the issue. To me and fianc\u00e9,  yes the problem was urgent/serious enough to merit backing out of my commitment.  Cathy, who knew exactly all the ins and outs of the situation, felt that it wasn't,  she thought someone else could have helped him. I felt like it was my role to help him. He did try to find someone else for the weds evening, but it was short notice, and not something simple to ask of a friend or acquaintance. It had been on going before the trip started. Sorry I'm not able to reveal the exact details. If it had to be put off another day,  it would have cost him hundreds and put his employment in jeopardy. I can say that in my heart it felt like the right decision.  Was i absolutely the only person on the planet who could help? No.", "YTA - your story doesn\u2019t add up.", "Yta- your friend did not sign up to be alone, and it was her first time abroad. You abandoned her and tbh I wouldn\u2019t be your friend if I was her. Bad friend", "No, you don\u2019t.", "It\u2019s none of your business if she clearly chose not to disclose the info as it doesn\u2019t matter.  It was costing more money than it was worth to stay the extra night and was causing massive stress. An adult made a decision.
