If your son would \\[eventually\\] enjoy a military career, and be able to have a better shot at a good one because of the family connections, then it makes sense to set him up to make as educated a choice as possible.

Depending on the staff assigned to the command for that particular course, it could be a great, very accurate dipiction of military life, or it could be so far off he would still have no idea of the real experience.  \n\nHS is a time to find himself and engage in what interests him. He'll have plenty of time to join a service after, and while JROTC might look good on a college application, there are lots of other extra curriculars that look just as good, if not better, even for a service academy.

Regardless of what contract you sign, the government owns you for 8 years (how ever many active plus the remainder as inactive ready reserve). \n\nWhile possible, it is a very long and drawn out process to quit in boot camp. They want to keep people and do not let people quit easily. The only exception is you can usually get out pretty quickly if you attempt suicide.\n\nEdit: \nSource: 7 years and counting as a government servant.", "This is the most ridiculous strawman I've seen in a long time.\n\n10/10 would chuckle again.", "LOL. Because clearly junior ROTC designed for high school kids and sex work are on the same playing field.\n\nThis is basically an extracurricular activity that teaches anyone, regardless of whether they go into a military career, strong leadership skills, and discipline that will benefit them for a lifetime.\n\nLike seriously, what is the harm?\n\nDo you know what causes harm?  Letting high school students play football and cause permanent brain injuries. These parents are winning at life above and beyond every single set of parents who like to enjoy Friday night lights.", "Absolutely. The worst thing you want is someone to serve when they actually don't want to serve.", "Or hasn\u2019t experienced it yet.\n\nHis dad and brother do, it\u2019s not crazy to think he might if he\u2019s on the fence. This sub doesn\u2019t like the concept, but many kids do actually like the experience, even while disliking stuff like uniformity and hair buzzing.\n\nIt\u2019s not crazy to trial it and it sounds like OP is supportive if kid decides he doesn\u2019t want it. Lots of people are projecting their feelings about the military on this one, but in a military family it\u2019s not crazy to find out if the kid takes after his dad/bro in a safe trial like this vs finding out way later.", "Sure, but on the fence means part of him may be interested. It sounds like she\u2019s conflicted because programs like this have a bad rap and it\u2019s more her husbands thing, but tbh, I see a two week trial as a great way for the son to find out.\n\nPeople are projecting their feelings about the military on this, but OP isn\u2019t wrong, many kids thrive in exactly this kind of environment, and it sounds like OP is supportive if the kid doesn\u2019t like it, just wants the two week \u201cstick it out\u201d dealie.", "Let's be real you don't talk about the non fun stuff when trying to rope someone into anything.", "That\u2019s kinda common. Especially for someone who may have expressed half hearted interest, but hasn\u2019t really thought about it", "Gotta switch it up for funsies every now and then, right?", "HE LEARNED SCHEDULING AND TIME MAAAAANAGEMENT!", "Also send me a link if you have a video that depicts what you\u2019re claiming is happening, please.", "You\u2019re generalising. I was in both Iraq and Afghanistan as military and a private mil contractor, totalling almost 7 year long deployments. In Iraq in their constitution, we as contractors had enormous room if we had to shoot someone. We were virtually untouchable as far as the law is concerned, yet I never interacted or heard of anyone shooting someone who didn\u2019t shoot at us first, women and children were used as human shields and the folks there did that to their own. Yes causalities of war happen, but our directives were very clear on engagement. \n\nI\u2019m glad and sorry you never witnessed real world war zones. Glad because it\u2019s hell, sad because you\u2019re eating up what the media depicts and makes the US look like the bad guys when that\u2019s the furthest from the truth.", "You would rather be uninformed then? Only rely on known unreliable sources? Suit yourself.", ">Like seriously, what is the harm?\n\nThat the kid doesn't want it?", "If the boy isn't interested in the cadet training then he shouldn't have to do it. Seems both his parents want to push him to atleast finish that much, I think that's overstepping is all.", "On the fence may also be because he feels pressured by his family.", "Cool so you're a war criminal.", " I choose to be informed by people who aren't nut cases such as yourself.", "It doesn\u2019t say anywhere that the kid doesn\u2019t want it, you\u2019re making an assumption.\n\nPlenty of kids get signed up for extracurricular activities because their parents want them to try something new. \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference?\n\nIt\u2019s two weeks. It\u2019s basically sleep away camp. It\u2019s not exactly abuse.", "Why does everyone assume \u201con the fence\u201d is a lie? All we have is the OPs account and some people actually do know their kids. \n\nIf OP is wrong about the kid and it is pressure, the camp will probably reveal that, but it\u2019s not like OP has said much else, and younger siblings usually do vaccinate between \u201cfollow family\u201d and \u201cdo own thing\u201d so again, not a crazy thought at all.\n\nThe hair doesn\u2019t say anything, lol. Every person I\u2019ve known going into military stuff hated the hair at first.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying that the kid definitely will love it, just pointing out everyone wants this to be drama where the kid is pressured to go, but sometimes on the fence actually means on the fence, lol. Like, sees pros like the fun activity, but also cons like hair and hard, unpleasant work", "Sure, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s way better to find out now with a camp vs later signing up for the military.\n\nObviously there might be pressure, no-ones arguing that, I\u2019m just laughing at the fact that this sub seems to always jump to \u201ckid is bending in force of family pressure\u201d and not ack that some kids actually do want and thrive in these types of things.\n\nA camp like OP is describing is pretty much the lowest pressure way to \u201cdip a toe in\u201d and find out if the kid is miserable or not. OP seems pretty open to kid not liking it, so why not find out now?", "How am I a war criminal? Please explain!!", "How am I a war criminal? Please explain!!", "I'm not saying the parents don't know their son, I just think they should accept if their son decides that he isn't even interested in doing the training instead of pushing him to finish it.", "We also tend to hate the hair and shaving rules while we're in. Growing a beard when you go on leave is a pretty normal thing a lot of folks do on active duty.\n\nIt doesn't help that the hair rule especially is pretty dumb. It doesn't serve any practical purpose like shaving does for ensuring you can get a good gas mask fit. It's literally just to reduce individuality.", "Yeah right. It'll be a case of \"see, it wasn't that bad\". \"short hair suits you, keep the buzz cut\". Etc.\n\nIt's a way to give the family a different angle to provide pressure. And peer pressure from within the camp. Or bullying from within.\n\n\nIf the kid doesn't want to get a buzz cut, then he doesn't get a buzz cut. It's his choice. If that's his deal breaker you don't pressure beyond that.  Heck, any 2 week camp with a requirement on your haircut feels like it breeds bullying. That's the issue.", "lol the entire participation in the iraq war was unjustified imperialism on a foreign nation. Ya'll shelled peoples homes, used WP and uranium ammo, and probably gave yourselves a fuckton of cancer.", "Eh, two weeks isn\u2019t a crazy amount of time to make a teenager stick it out. She\u2019s on here asking, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll pull him if it\u2019s something injurious or abusive, but it sounds like she\u2019s trying to figure out if making him stick with a commitment is bad, so I think it\u2019s fair to give her BoDoubt there.\n\nIt sounds like they\u2019re a military family, but they\u2019re willing to give up on the military thing for him as long as he tries it, two weeks isn\u2019t a crazy ask. Some families come with stuff like this - and if they\u2019re not otherwise abusive, it\u2019s not unreasonable to my mind. \n\nI do think it would be unreasonable if the two weeks was like - wilderness abusive survival, so my opinion totally depends on this being reasonable, but it sounds likely to be and mainly filled with exercise and so on, things that don\u2019t suck for teenagers to have to experience.", "Yeah. Lots of people on this sub are talking like the kid not wanting a baldhead means his parents are abusing him lol. \n\nMy nephew joined up, the latest in many in my family and I\u2019ve never seen him happier", "See, that\u2019s a perfect example of what I mean by projecting.\n\nNot everything is a bullying pressure struggle.\n\nSome kids actually enjoy this stuff and are literally on the fence, not \u201cmoms wrong and kids being pressured in\u201d.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were right, but id be equally nonplussed if you weren\u2019t and the kid loves it. Most people do end up taking after their family - most people are \u201cboring\u201d like that. Shockingly, most parents do know their kids.", "I don't think the kid should have to go through some military trial period just to satisfy his military-loving family though. If he doesn't want to do it, he shouldn't have to just because his family really wants to see if they can get another member to join in.", "But the kid hasn\u2019t taken that stance, again - we have OP saying he\u2019s flipped. So, again - not everything is always some secret super pressure thing, sometimes kids are undecided and sometimes families have expectations.\n\nI\u2019m from a huge family - I\u2019ve seen it go both ways. I personally felt pressured and annoyed over some of this stuff, and expected my many (32 now) neices and nephews to feel the same, but was surprised when most of them ended up being the opposite.\n\nThat\u2019s my point. Why assume all this stuff when OP has asked for the opinion based on her kid being back and forth. Why assume they don\u2019t know their kid and project all this stuff.\n\nIf the kid feels strongly against, he can take a stance against going. If he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s a two week experience lol."]}
