He thinks ALL children should be forced into 'trying out military service'.  So how hard does he push this \"Go, Go GI Joe\"?  Has he (and by extension, you) been trying to steer your kids into the military all along?\n\nHave you or your husband given him reason to believe that he'll be a disappointment/failure/unworthy if he doesn't conform to the military path you all have laid for him?  Have you told him that it's perfectly fine for him to say NO?", "YTA\n\nThis is super controlling, and your husband needs to get over himself and stop trying to make his son follow in his footsteps, and you need to stop enabling him.\n\nWhat would you do if your son said \"well OK I'll go if *you* shave your head.

It is perfectly ok for him to not want a military career.", "NAH\n\nDoesn\u2019t hurt to try it out and it doesn\u2019t hurt to not try it out.

I Think this would be more appropriate on r/Parenting", "NAH\n\nIn a vacuum, I'd probably agree with many who are saying \"but does the kid want to do this right now?\"\n\n But utilizing the resources and connections of your family is a pretty big advantage. If your son would \\[eventually\\] enjoy a military career, and be able to have a better shot at a good one because of the family connections, then it makes sense to set him up to make as educated a choice as possible. I think he would feel done wrong if, ten years into a sales career, he thinks \"I wish they'd pushed me just a bit harder, I was a dumb kid.\" There's merit in him being sure.\n\n  \nI think, worse than 'forcing' him to take the classes, is letting momentary childish hesitation be an obstacle. As long as the family is receptive and respectful if he says \"I tried it, I don't like it, this isn't for me,\" then I think that's worth some discomfort.", "NTA. You've clearly said that your son has wavered on whether he wants to follow in your husband's military footsteps. This is a good way to find out. Better to try a JROTC program than to sign up for 4 years of military service!\n\nA young man I know did something similar. He signed up for some kind of ROTC-style army thing and HATED it. He quit and came back home after just a few weeks (it was a residential program). The good thing is that he tried it out. Now he knows that's not for him. \n\nAlso, his mother says that he's changed a lot since he did that program: he's taking a lot more initiative, he started university, and basically grew up a lot as a result of that \"failed\" attempt at an army-style program. It taught him a lot\u2014even though it wasn't for him. \n\nThe important thing is that you let him quit if he wants to. Worst case scenario, he will learn new things.", "INFO:  How long is your sons hair?  Has he spent a lot of time and effort in growing it in a certain kind of way, or is it a large part of his identity right now?\n\nBeing a Vet myself I am a big proponent of service and discipline, but he can serve and develop all of that outside of a paramilitary group in school.  Depending on the staff assigned to the command for that particular course, it could be a great, very accurate dipiction of military life, or it could be so far off he would still have no idea of the real experience.  \n\nHS is a time to find himself and engage in what interests him. He'll have plenty of time to join a service after, and while JROTC might look good on a college application, there are lots of other extra curriculars that look just as good, if not better, even for a service academy.  Support him in doing what is best for him. If he's waffling on the idea, then offer another non-paramilitary alternative.\n\nEdit:  forgot - NAH - the conflict level of this post seems pretty low at this point to lable someone an ass as of yet.", "NTA. I was wavering about joining the military (Australia) after school, my parents were not keen on me joining. As I have got older, I regret not having done the military as I think it would have helped me. \n\nYour son seems keen to do it, you didn't say if he was upset having to cut his hair, it just sounds like he was surprised. \n\nAnd your last paragraph - confirms NTA - if he doesn't like it he can quit.", "NAH", "Yta has he ever had boiling water poured over his arm?

Is that true, or is he being pushed into it? \n\nI think *if he has expressed unaided interest* then you\u2019re right that having some small exposure now is a good thing. My brother thought he wanted to be a police officer. Our local department does a junior academy so high school kids can figure out if it\u2019s for them.
