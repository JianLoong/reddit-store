If your son would \\[eventually\\] enjoy a military career, and be able to have a better shot at a good one because of the family connections, then it makes sense to set him up to make as educated a choice as possible.

Depending on the staff assigned to the command for that particular course, it could be a great, very accurate dipiction of military life, or it could be so far off he would still have no idea of the real experience.  \n\nHS is a time to find himself and engage in what interests him. He'll have plenty of time to join a service after, and while JROTC might look good on a college application, there are lots of other extra curriculars that look just as good, if not better, even for a service academy.

I didn't join the military afterward, either. What I will say is that this needs to be your son's choice, not yours or your spouse's, or he'll resent you for it. If you force him to join, and he labels you as an AH, he'll be justified in feeling that way.", "NTA, if he\u2019s unsure, it\u2019ll give him a good idea of how it could be, and if he wants to drop JROTC I\u2019m sure he can. Either way, he\u2019ll learn some good skills, and meet good people.\n\nJROTC isn\u2019t a contract into the military. Nobody is forcing him into enlisting after he\u2019s over with it.", "YTA. \n\nLook. the buzzed hair issue, much like reddit's classic 'Iranian yogurt' dilemma, is just the tip of the iceberg. Also, the Sea Cadet Corps is run by the military directly. They will hound, cajole, and brainwash your kid to no end. \n\nDo not make him go. Nurture his other talents, have him join the boy scouts if his dad wants something with discipline, but the SCC is a recruiting tool. Full stop, period. \n\nThe PTSD and mental issues I have watched former military friends endure, after joining a 'Fun program' in highschool and getting suckered into the real deal would make you weep.", "NAH: I don\u2019t think this is a bad idea. JROTC isn\u2019t a commitment to anything. Hell even regular ROTC you can drop out of. I think you giving him an opportunity to experience something before committing is smart. If he hates the regulation of JROTC, probably shouldn\u2019t join the military.\n\nI am making assumptions here, but he doesn\u2019t join the military, are you able to help pay for college? I think having a frank discussion about how he will need to pay for college (if necessary) if he doesn\u2019t do ROTC or Service Academy. A lot of people go that route because of the free education. In my opinion, it is worth it for the 4 year service commitment after school.", "Why did you post this on both AITB and AITA?", "YTA. \n\nWe are a family of vets, but we'd never have forced our son into the life if he wasn't absolutely sure. He chose it, and we're proud, but it has to be his choice 100%, and fully knowing what the life entails.", "Wait, you buried the lede a bit!

I understand what you're trying to impart on your child.  But all you're going to teach him is to resent you for forcing him.  He will resent you and your husband for this.  If not hate you for it.\n\nI would absolutely love for any of my children to follow in my footsteps.  But I'd never force it like you are.  I want them to WANT to follow.

Your kid sounds like he's trying to keep people happy.", "INFO  does your high school aged child have a different idea about what he wants to do with his life, or is he wavering on all of it and not just military service? I ask this because as a parent I think its totally acceptable to push kids to try things especially when they are undecided, and of course the first thing you would push is what you know and live. If a haircut that will grow back in a few months really is the hill he is willing to die on, push on mama.\n\nBut on the other hand if you aren't providing the whole story, and the hair is just the latest excuse because you aren't listening to what your child really wants (maybe he wants to be an artist, author, scientist, astronomer, etc - I can think of soooo many careers that don't require any more skills at discipline, appearance, etc. than what he already has by simply growing up with a military dad) then shame on you for pushing your personal agenda onto your kid. Let him focus on the career he already knows he wants.\n\nMaybe you could compromise by offering some non-military options that teach other important life skills that he hasn't already experienced at home. The most important thing is to help him find A path, not YOUR path.", "YTA. This is a really sick way to raise children.", "Lol lot of Anti war commentary.  But it's not just about war.  It is about a mindset.\nBoy scouts is also set up similarly.   We did cub scouts but when we transfered into boy scouts there was alot more of the leadership hierarchy, which I and my son did not appreciate.

I am not saying that nothing is wrong with the military, I do think we need to redo the way we go about it. I just want to make the point that for many people including myself in poor areas that military specifically targets the area to get people to join so many young adults have no other choice but to enlist. I also want to remind people that military pays for higher education, I was told by a teacher to join in order to go to college. Again many people do not have the opportunity to go to college unless they join. I think we need to remember that for many the military is the only option they have to have a decent life so saying they are horrible people is simply classist.", "My kids both took a gap year before college. \nCommunity service can mean anything, but Americorps is structured depending on the program and you can earn a living stipend plus an education voucher for school.\n\nhttps://americorps.gov\n\nKids in high school, should focus on high school imo.\nI\u2019m guessing your husband feels your son hasn\u2019t been taught how to discipline himself already?\n\nHair grows and it does sound like it could be interesting but it should be his choice.", "It sounds like he already knows he doesn't want to do let him not instead of pushing him to do it.
