If your son would \\[eventually\\] enjoy a military career, and be able to have a better shot at a good one because of the family connections, then it makes sense to set him up to make as educated a choice as possible.

Depending on the staff assigned to the command for that particular course, it could be a great, very accurate dipiction of military life, or it could be so far off he would still have no idea of the real experience.  \n\nHS is a time to find himself and engage in what interests him. He'll have plenty of time to join a service after, and while JROTC might look good on a college application, there are lots of other extra curriculars that look just as good, if not better, even for a service academy.

I see that a lot of the comments already made are opposed to \"preparing kids for war\", but a lot of the emphasis in these programs are directed toward developing knowledge of the real world and some basic leadership skills.\n\nI don't know if things have changed greatly over the years, but the Civil Air Patrol trains to conduct aerial search and rescue.  The commitment is for one meeting per week and other times for other activities.  There was an annual summer \"encampment\" (optional).  We also did campouts, canoe trips, swimming, museum visits.  Although the weekly meetings included some military drill and ceremonies, it was not the main emphasis.  There was no head shaving (except for Crazy Andy), and you could walk away at any time.  It was more like a social club with military trappings.  If your son is unsure, CAP may be the way to go.", "NTA.  He will will definitely know how he feels about it after that.  Some people just don't want to do the military.  Some definitely do.  At the very least he will be able to say he tried it out.", "Seem to me, Springfield has a problem with discipline.", "YTA for even considering sending your child to be a bullet sponge for a corrupt government.", "YTA if he\u2019s only doing it because of you. There are other things out there that also teach discipline, respect etc etc. Try judo or take-kwon-do.", "NAH, sounds like you are just trying to support him making life choices that he wants. \n\nI think its fair for him to say he doesn't want to go. A lot of kids don't want to shave their hair, that's normal. It doesn't sound like you are forcing him to go, but I don't think he wants to disappoint you guys either. \n\nI think that if someone wants to join the military, it should 100% be their own choice and commitment. I think any level of \"forcing\" it on them is counter to the great benefits they could get. The best way for him to get amazing things for himself from military service is to want to do it of his own choosing. \n\nI work at a school, and this poor kid I know HATED being force to do wrestling by his parents. He resented it greatly. I personally think he'd get a great benefit from learning wrestling, because he's kind of a gentle kid who seems like he'd be easy to pick on. I wouldn't have wanted to be forced to do wrestling either if I wasn't interested in it. I grew up and ended up doing martial arts later in life, and the fact that I choose it made it possible for me to enjoy it. I may have resented it if I was forced to do it when I wasn't ready.\n\nI saw him today, and he was so happy that he wasn't in wrestling anymore. He looked much more peaceful, and I'm glad his parents didn't make him do something he didn't want to do.", "INFO: What does your son want as it seems everything is done to make your husband happy.", "If he has expressed interest in doing so himself, NTA. If this is just because your husband wants him to, YTA.", "Info: why does your husband want to single-handedly repopulate the military with his offspring? Does your son even WANT to do this?", "YTA. Why do you want to prime your son to kill and die? Can you really not comprehend any other way for him to learn discipline or leadership? Christ", "YTA. I did JROTC all 4 years of high school and have been in the military for over 8 years. But I would never force someone to do it. It\u2019s not for everyone and that\u2019s ok. Also learning discipline and proper uniform through jrotc is bullshit. It won\u2019t teach you that. It will just teach him to hate you more.", "I do want to point out you don\u2019t always get put overseas (and get shit on if you don\u2019t). My boyfriend joined the army cuz it was his only chance at college. Long story short he ended up doing railway work stateside. I think it\u2019s very lucky he didn\u2019t get psychologically fucked up having to fight. If you tell anyone else his posting he \u201cdidn\u2019t really serve his country\u201d even though he did 6 years? Idk. People are stupid.\n\nI digress, point being many parts of the military do not include \u201ckilling brown children\u201d. Sometimes they DO go overseas but get stationed in non warring countries like Japan or Germany or anywhere that isn\u2019t a warring place. I just think your overall statement was a very ignorant and jaded thing to assume, but I get your point overall.", "Y\u2019all we can shit on the bad parents without shutting on military men. What the other commenter said is correct. Also everyone thinks military = killing innocent. It CAN mean that, but it can also mean being a chef in Illinois for hungry G.I. Or people in Japan just\u2026 hanging\u2026.\n\nIt can also mean life and death terrible ptsd after. Don\u2019t shot on the military. Shit on the people who send these people out to fight.\n\nAlso find it weird Reddit is so anti America sticking their nose in shit but get mad when we don\u2019t. Damned if we do. Damned if we don\u2019t.", "the point of those military bases in non-warring countries is to project imperial power in those countries. it is still evil, even if it's not a combat zone.", "Broski, I cant get behind the idea of humans being trained to obey orders and not to question them.\n\nGoes beyond the getting harassed into submission every army does. If you get ordered to kill, you obey without thinking as \" its an order \" . That kind of mentality makes me sick. And dont get me started with making people think its patriotic to kill others.\n\nIt doesnt help that the US particularly is known for drone striking children. Terrible ptsd? Every time i hear veterans they all complain the gov doesnt do enough for them despite their service. \n\nReddit is just a place to say things. Doesnt matter. Same as twitter, same as 4 chan ,etc etc. Never heard anyone being mad no poor desert country isnt being invaded by the us, but maybe you are in different subs than me. Saw some suba pro russia where people did want the war to continue, so i believe what you say about some complaining theres not enough army bases of the usa around the world", "I think that having discipline that one obtains with the boy scouts or cadets is better than not having that sort of discipline.\n\nBeing able to use a weapon or survive in difficult situations is a skill that all humans should have... and hope not to need to use...\n\nSea cadets (that's what we called them when I was growing up in the UK) would teach a civilian skills that could help them later on, in a career in merchant shipping.\n\nBut yes, teach your young lads how to be soldiers *but don't actually send them to foreign lands to die for corporations, ffs.* Let the government invest in them without the government being able to recoup their investment, lol.", "My mom had tried to do that with me and my brother. My dad was in the military. Uncles in both sides. Needless to say-the day I finally said \u201cNo\u201d\u2026Things started to change.

You\u2019ll always regret it", "YTA, I dont believe kids should be forced into extracurricular activities, let alone being encouraged to enlist in the military. That is something that should 100% be a person choice because THEY want it. Sounds like the dad is trying to live vicariously through his kids.", "YTA. Military is a bullshit environment and the only thing that makes it tolerable is really wanting to be there. Don't force your kid into that unless you want him to resent you.

Do we not acknowledge the propaganda machine? \n\nHave we not stopped to consider why they particular pray on underage boys? Or why none of the recruiters are willing to forecast the horrors of war? Why army toys and media is pushed on boys as young as possible? Why the military is associated with \u201ccoolness\u201d and \u201chonor\u201d and not murder and power? \n\nOr why military membership is so closely tied to heritage? \n\nCome on now. Choice is a fickle thing. How much choice do people really have when they\u2019ve been programmed to behave a certain way?
