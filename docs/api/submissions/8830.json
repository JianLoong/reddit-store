The issue came up a couple days ago where he told me that he was losing feelings for my bestie. That he didn\u2019t want to hurt her, so he\u2019d just go along with the relationship until she broke things off. My best friend has no clue he feels this way, and she continues to be super affectionate towards him.

She is clearly insecure about this, seemingly for good reason, and keeping it from her could easily ruin your friendship when it all comes out.", "I would tell her, personally. If I put myself in your friends situation, I\u2019d 100% want you to tell me. I\u2019d do it very gently and respectfully, it\u2019s absolutely going to hurt her.

But here's another perspective if you're questioning where your loyalties should lie: He's supposed to be your friend, yet he put you in this ridiculously awkward and difficult position where, no matter what, it feels like you're picking a side. He should never have told you that. And it doesn't sound like this is the first time he's tried to put you in the middle. What he *should* do is pony up and own his feelings, rather than lead her on.\n\nOn one hand, it might be best not to \"meddle\" as you say. But on the other, if your bestie ever found out you knew, that would probably hurt her a lot. There's no right answer here; I think you ought to be ready for some fallout either way.

But I would really make sure that was the last option, for the sake of your friendship. You need to sit him down and tell him that \"waiting for her to break up with him\" is a horrible, mean and childish thing to do. Especially seeing that she is already so insecure about his feelings for her. He needs to grow up and talk with his girlfriend and end things, because he is just hurting and wasting her time.", "Boyfriend is using you to break up with your friend since he's too gutless to handle it himself.  NTA.", "You are NTA no matter what you do- sticky situation to be in. But letting your friend be led on sucks, I agree with u/sci_fi_bi, he needs to talk to her or you will. \n\nIf she finds out that you knew yet didn\u2019t tell her, you\u2019ll be hurting her twice over as a result. \n\nGet this overwith. You can\u2019t control his actions but this needs to stop and either he take action or it\u2019s on you.", "YWBTA\n\nIts not your place, and from your description it does sound like youve inserted yourself into the middle of their relationship.\n\nIf she asks again, your response should be that it\u2019s not healthy to be so insecure in a relationship and she should talk to her bf.  Then butt out.", "YWBTA. If you are close to the boyfriend it\u2019s be much better to encourage him to come clean. Remind him he can\u2019t meet the right person if he\u2019s with the wrong one. It\u2019s okay to lose interest, it\u2019s not okay to lead someone on", "This is tough. If I were you I would tell the boyfriend to your best friend how he feels. It's not right to play with someone's emotions. If he keeps procrastinating then tell her. So NTA depending on how things go down", "NAH. Sounds like you\u2019re all pretty young and inexperienced with romantic relationships. The boyfriend is being pretty shitty by putting you in that position, but if you *would* have been the friend he would lean on in the same situation, but with a different partner, then it\u2019s understandable that he\u2019d turn to you here. I can also see him being scared to break things off with a close friend for fear he may lose her friendship. It seems like he doesn\u2019t really know how he feels, and that he\u2019s looking for guidance from you. Being a teenager in a romantic relationship is weird. Hell, being an adult in a romantic relationship can be weird. You\u2019ll figure it out: all of you. Hopefully everyone just remembers that they were friends first.", "YWBTA \n\nThis is not your place. I feel like you unintentionally inserted yourself in the middle of their relationship and now don\u2019t know how to remove yourself from the situation.\n\nIf the BF is no longer in love with his GF, he needs to grow some balls and tell her himself. \n\nSide note : is your friend really asking 3x a day if you think her bf still has feelings for her? What the hell! I know I would get annoyed real fast. You need to tell her that if she feels unsure about her bf\u2019s feelings for her, she should communicate this with him, not you. You\u2019re their friend, not their damn relationship counsilor.", "I\u2019m getting extremely conflicting results. While all your information has been really helpful, I still don\u2019t know wether to tell her or not. I\u2019ve gotten good arguments from both sides so I think I\u2019ll just have to sleep on it and decide what\u2019s best.", "NTA. I think you need to tell her. Being a good friend sometimes means addressing difficult things out love and care for one another. \n\nI would feel really betrayed if I found out one of my best friends knew something like this and didn\u2019t tell me. Would you want her to tell you if the roles were reversed?", "ESH YTA", "INFO: how old are y\u2019all?", "You do realise that your friend is manipulating you? He\u2019s the AH. He doesn\u2019t want to break it off so is hoping you\u2019ll do it for him. Tell him you\u2019re not going to do his dirty work and he\u2019s got to tell her himself. He\u2019s not a good friend to put you in this position. I\u2019d let him know how angry you are at being put in the middle and would stop contact with him.", "Next time she asks you if you think he still wants to be in a relationship with her, instead of reassuring her, ask her why she questions his interest. Perhaps if she reflects on the situation a bit she might find that deep down she already senses his interest is fading. \nNTA but you have been put in an awkward position by the boyfriend.", "YWBTA if you told her because no matter how you deliver that message it won't end well. Cue ability to shoot the messenger and lose friends. The AH here is the BF. Shyness may be an issue but his tactics exhibit laziness and  lack of care for your friend's feelings. She'll be devastated regardless but if she actually finds out he's been leading her on because he gives up on reciprocating her attention then she'll be utterly heartbroken. Tell him to stop talking to you about it, grow a set, and talk about it to the person who matters.", "NTA \n\nThe BF is a coward and by telling you about his lack of feelings for your friend, he\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll tell her for him.\n\nDon\u2019t do it\u2026.Say NOTHING.", "I felt the same way. He\u2019s just too damn scared to do it. He like refuses to break up with her unless she does it first. He\u2019s being stubborn asf.", "And then shoot the messenger I\u2019m sure. But I hate keeping that from my best friend.", "Yeah.. she\u2019s super insecure and overthinks a shit ton. But I still love her to pieces.", "Yeah, believe me I COMPLETELY understand feeling insecure. But three times a day is just unbelievably unhealthy. You can\u2019t really stop yourself from having the thoughts that enter your head, but you can control how you react to them", "I don't think you'll find better advice, and you already mentioned shoot the messenger. Maybe softly encourage him to speak up, but even that's a bit dicey. It's awkward watching 2 shy people try to communicate in a relationship, sometimes,  but letting them deal with it will also be good experience for them in the future.", "And if her friend finds out that she knew?", "True story.", "This is the advice. \n\nPush him to say something and demand he never tell you anything like that ever again", "THIS. NTA, but so much this.\n\nYou say something, she thinks you're a liar, you're the bad guy.\n\nYou say something, she confronts her boyfriend, he calls you a liar, you're the bad guy.\n\nYou say something, she confronts her boyfriend, he tells her it's true, they break up, it's your fault, you're the bad guy.\n\nYou say something, she confronts her boyfriend, he turns the conversation around to you interfering, you're the common enemy, you're the bad guy.\n\nAnd, for fairness:\n\nYou don't say anything, she and her boyfriend split up, he tells her he's surprised that she didn't know it was coming because he told you, your friend confronts you, you tell her that her relationship was none of your business and you expected her boyfriend to bring it up with *the person he's actually in a relationship with*. You aren't the good guy, but you're not the bad guy either.", "That\u2019s a good idea. Have her confront him in a \u201cnon-confrontational\u201d way", "Yes.  Tell her that she needs to be having that conversation with him instead of with you.  You already know her BF is too much of a coward to break up with her, but if you can get her to initiate the conversation, I think that would be best.  If she's non-confrontational, help her rehearse some ways she could get it started and maybe even help her work through what her reaction will be if it's \"worst case scenario\" (which you obviously know it is).", "It's fine to fall out of love with someone, it is not fine to continue the relationship because they have not. This can lead to lasting issues as well for you and your friend. NTA the asshole for wanting to tell your friend and do something.", "I once inadvertently caught a friend\u2019s boyfriend cheating on her and a lot of people told me not to insert myself, it\u2019s none of my business etc. I thought about it a lot, I even thought about confronting him and giving him the opportunity to tell her. In the end, I told her and it was so hard to do. Seeing her pain was awful and I hated doing it. However, after all was said and done she appreciated that I had the guts to be honest with her.", "I feel the same way. I should tell him to grow up. I just feel like it\u2019s not my place. But at the same time I hate seeing my friend getting hurt because of it", "I know it\u2019s not my place at all. And I really haven\u2019t tried to insert myself into their relationship. I just get told things and then I have that burden on me. It\u2019d suck if this all came out and \u201cI knew about it the entire time.\u201d I just don\u2019t know how to feel or what to do. The boyfriend has put me in an awkward situation", "I\u2019ll keep that in consideration. If he can\u2019t man up and tell her then I\u2019ll have to let her down easy. I can\u2019t let him lead her on but he deserves the chance to end things himself.", "Thank you for those kind words. It truly sounds like you really understand. I hope everything will turn out well in the end.", "Thank you. I needed comments like this to put things in perspective for me. I\u2019m kinda a pushover so it\u2019s me that needs to \u201cgrow some balls\u201d most of the time. But I do think he needs to end things with her.", "I'm going to just say what I've been thinking.\n\nThey're both acting like little kids.  She's bugging you 3 times a day, wanting reassurance that he still likes her. He wants out but is too chicken, and wants you to do the dirty work.\n\nSit them down together. Say that you're tired of being their middle man.  Tell her that her insecurities are coming from her subconscious mind picking up his cues that he's not into her any more. And tell him that he needs to step up and just do what needs doing.  Tell them you're done with the drama. It's not your business to worry about if they can't just communicate themselves.\n\nThen walk away.  That's the key. Say your bit and leave. What happens after that is totally on them.\n\nNTA", "Personally, I would tell my friend because I would like to be told if I were in her shoes. But giving the bf a deadline/ultimatum might be enough to force his hand and cover your ass so to speak.  It honestly seems like he's expecting you to break up with her for him, which is  ridiculous.", "He\u2019s not scared, he\u2019s gutless.\n\nhow many times have you talked to him about breaking up with her?", "What would you have liked, if the roles were reversed? Would you want your friend to tell you or keep you in the dark until he finally pulled the plug?", "I mean, if he keeps bringing it up with you, then she's probably picking up some weird vibes as well. She might be sensing that he's not as into her as he used to be, hence why she keeps asking you, so it might not be down to insecurity. Maybe ask her why she keeps asking next time she does?\n\nI would say to him that if he really feels that way, then make a decision. Leading someone on is a complete asshole thing to do, it's not fair on either party.", "How? The only people who know she knows are her and the boyfriend. You really think he is going to be like, \u201chey I told your friend I don\u2019t like you.\u201d He is afraid of the confrontation of ending the relationship but he isn\u2019t afraid of THAT confrontation?", "Why would that be a problem?", "I totally get that it's hard when you are stuck between two people. But yeah, he needs to grow up and end it. If someone told me they aren't breaking up with their SO because they waiting for them to do it instead... I'd seriously reconsider my friendship with them.", "HE should talk to HIS GF. Who knows - it could be something they could work on.  There are some people who give their partners deadlines ie '2 months and if nothing changes I'm out!\" without ever telling the partner somethings wrong - that sucks.  If your friend is always asking you for reassurance it could mean she senses something is up with him.  He should man up and talk to her.", "Tell her she needs to have a serious discussion with him about the topic because you are uncomfortable being in the middle", "Youve put you in an awkward situation.  If he talks about it to you once, that\u2019s all in him.\n\nBut if he brings it up repeatedly, then that\u2019s on you.    \nThis isn\u2019t a situation that happened to you, it\u2019s something you not only allowed to happen, but you participated in.\n\nTime to put your big girl/boy panties on, tell them both that your aren\u2019t the third person in their relationship, they need to sort things out without you.", "Quite a few despite my desperate attempts to avoid the subject.

A best friend is someone you trust. OP\u2019s friend is constantly asking her \u2018do you think he still likes me?\u2019 and OP is lying because she hopes the bf will come out and tell her himself, I can understand. It\u2019s a shit situation for OP but even shittier for her friend who\u2019s being led on not only by her boyfriend, but her best friend too. Best friends don\u2019t keep things from each other, this would be a hard blow for OP\u2019s friend, who\u2019s being betrayed, and I say that gently, but nonetheless.\n\nI was in a similar ish situation as a teen. My best friend knew something and didn\u2019t tell me. A friend who I wasn\u2019t as close with did. It sucked to hear, but not as much as it sucked to know I couldn\u2019t count on my best friend to be honest with me, even if it meant I\u2019d get my feelings hurt. \n\nOP should not have been dragged into this mess, but now that she is- she has a certain responsibility to her friend. She is thus far being more loyal to the boyfriend.\n\nEdit for wording.", "Tbh you sound like a teenager. She has no obligation to tell her \u201cbestie\u201d things told to her in confidence. That isn\u2019t how friendship works. You don\u2019t just ignore the feelings of everyone else for the sake of one friend. If something was told to her in confidence, it would be far better not to tell her friend. As an adult, I put ZERO trust in anyone who has ever told me a secret that wasn\u2019t theirs to tell. It is a sign of an immature, selfish person when someone breaks confidences. And telling her friend this information can have no good outcome. But there are a LOT of ways it can go very wrong.", "Well, we\u2019re all different. You do you."]}
