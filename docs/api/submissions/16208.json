There are a couple reasons for this, but I\u2019ll keep it short.\n\nMy dad was a horrible man. He cheated on my mom, abused her and her children\u2014myself included\u2014and used money from his traveling business to fund personal ventures instead of his own family.

I\u2019ve gotten some help for myself through therapy and personal interests. I\u2019m much better now, but the improvements I\u2019ve made have subsequently made me colder towards my dad. I didn\u2019t want to be deterred by his bs, so I put up that wall to shield my feelings.\n\nThis incident happened a few hours ago. My parents were making travel plans this week for my dad\u2019s business. My mom asked me to help her with cooking the next morning since she would be running around buying for the trip. I agreed to help out since I wasn\u2019t planning on doing anything that day.\n\nMy dad came home late at night from the office. After eating, he called me and asked, \u201cWill you be able to come into the office for an hour tomorrow morning? I need to pick up a few things for the office.\u201d\n\nI responded with, \u201cAsk her,\u201d pointing to my mom sitting across from him. His eyes went wide and he sort of scowled at me.\n\nMy mom, turned to me and said, \u201cYou can go for just the hour. Just finish up the cooking when you get back.\u201d\n\nI then said \u201cOkay, then. I\u2019m able to come in for the hour.\u201d I began walking to my room when my dad called me back. I wasn\u2019t sure why he was calling me again at the time, but I prepared my mind for what he was about to say.\n\nHe said, in a low, angry voice, \u201cYou know, the answer you gave me was wrong. I would like you to think about what you said to me.\u201d\n\nI looked at him funny and asked, \u201cWhat did I say wrong?\u201d\n\nHe responded, \u201cI\u2019d like you to think about it. If you can\u2019t figure it out after reflecting, you can come to me later and I can explain it.\u201d\n\nMy blood began to boil. \u201cWell, can you tell me exactly what I said that was wrong \\*now\\*?\u201d He dismissed me again in the same manner. \n\nMy mom chimed in. \u201cYeah\u2026 what \\*did\\* she say that was wrong in her answer? Why now say it now?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2018t even bother to listen and turned around to walk away. You could hear the anger coming from my words. I said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t learn anything from this, it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d\n\nI heard my mom verbally agree with what I said, but nothing else as I closed my room door behind me. I stewed in my room for a long time. A part of me felt justified in walking away from my dad the way I did. I asked him \\*twice\\* to explain any wrongdoing on my end, but each time he refused to communicate it to me. I felt as though I was being spoken to like a child. \n\nBut there\u2019s still a tiny part of me that feels I went to far, and that, for the sake of my mom, I should have approached the situation differently.
