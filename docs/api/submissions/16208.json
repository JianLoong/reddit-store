There are a couple reasons for this, but I\u2019ll keep it short.\n\nMy dad was a horrible man. He cheated on my mom, abused her and her children\u2014myself included\u2014and used money from his traveling business to fund personal ventures instead of his own family. I\u2019m still living under his roof because I don\u2019t have a job at the moment. I just finished school, so I\u2019ll get one soon.\n\nBecause of the trauma caused by my father, I\u2019ve been dealing with anxiety and depression. I\u2019ve gotten some help for myself through therapy and personal interests. I\u2019m much better now, but the improvements I\u2019ve made have subsequently made me colder towards my dad. I didn\u2019t want to be deterred by his bs, so I put up that wall to shield my feelings.\n\nThis incident happened a few hours ago. My parents were making travel plans this week for my dad\u2019s business. My mom asked me to help her with cooking the next morning since she would be running around buying for the trip. I agreed to help out since I wasn\u2019t planning on doing anything that day.\n\nMy dad came home late at night from the office. After eating, he called me and asked, \u201cWill you be able to come into the office for an hour tomorrow morning? I need to pick up a few things for the office.\u201d\n\nI responded with, \u201cAsk her,\u201d pointing to my mom sitting across from him. His eyes went wide and he sort of scowled at me.\n\nMy mom, turned to me and said, \u201cYou can go for just the hour. Just finish up the cooking when you get back.\u201d\n\nI then said \u201cOkay, then. I\u2019m able to come in for the hour.\u201d I began walking to my room when my dad called me back. I wasn\u2019t sure why he was calling me again at the time, but I prepared my mind for what he was about to say.\n\nHe said, in a low, angry voice, \u201cYou know, the answer you gave me was wrong. I would like you to think about what you said to me.\u201d\n\nI looked at him funny and asked, \u201cWhat did I say wrong?\u201d\n\nHe responded, \u201cI\u2019d like you to think about it. If you can\u2019t figure it out after reflecting, you can come to me later and I can explain it.\u201d\n\nMy blood began to boil. \u201cWell, can you tell me exactly what I said that was wrong \\*now\\*?\u201d He dismissed me again in the same manner. \n\nMy mom chimed in. \u201cYeah\u2026 what \\*did\\* she say that was wrong in her answer? Why now say it now?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2018t even bother to listen and turned around to walk away. You could hear the anger coming from my words. I said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t learn anything from this, it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d\n\nI heard my mom verbally agree with what I said, but nothing else as I closed my room door behind me. I stewed in my room for a long time. A part of me felt justified in walking away from my dad the way I did. I asked him \\*twice\\* to explain any wrongdoing on my end, but each time he refused to communicate it to me. I felt as though I was being spoken to like a child. \n\nBut there\u2019s still a tiny part of me that feels I went to far, and that, for the sake of my mom, I should have approached the situation differently.

Your answer implied that she was of a higher authority than he was and his poor self esteem couldn't handle it. \n\nYou made him feel like he wasn't in control. He can't handle that because he's an insecure little man.", "NTA\n\nYou challenged the dynamics of your family household by giving power to your mother and taking it away from your father. He didn't like that.\n\nIn saying that - I would be cautious with doing this because you put your mom in a difficult position (being mediator between dad and child).\n\nIt sounds like he has an authoritarian approach (my way or the high way) which is known to be terrible for development.

I\u2019m struggling to understand why you said \u201cask her\u201d when your dad asked you for help.\nYour dads reaction is a strange one, he sounds like he has to be in control.

But to be fair you also didn\u2019t express why you wanted him to ask her either.\n\nI\u2019m still confused as to why you could only cook because you weren\u2019t doing anything else, when it seems like you don\u2019t do anything else and therefore should be more than willing to cook.", "NTA he's the AH. His ego got hurt and he didn't like it.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is abusive. Wild guess here, but I think he wanted you to say \"Yes, sir!\" with a salute and figure out how you're gonna do it. He expects unconditional submission and he doesn't care about what it does to you, whether you have different plans, opinions, ambitions.
