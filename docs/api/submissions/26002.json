It was specific to the situation presented, and my phrasing was evidently poorly chosen. My mistakenly more abruptly phrased point was that she could\u2019ve made it in college, but didn\u2019t wish to, and while that\u2019s okay and completely up to her, she shouldn\u2019t blame others for how her career has advanced. \n\nI finally contacted my fianc\u00e9e and asked her to meet me so we could talk. Apparently, both her parents and her sister took my side on the matter (important for later). She had fled her parents\u2019 house and was living with a friend. I told her I love her and explained how I **didn\u2019t** mean to imply that she squandered her potential *irreversibly* and told her that I believe we can fix things if we work together. I apologized for my ill-tasted comment, and I repeatedly told her that my point was never to demean or disdain her, and that I do not consider her to be below me. I tried to explain that none of us obstructed her journey to success, and that we do not bare accountability for her academic path, but we are all here to support her. I encouraged her to try whatever she thinks is best right now, and promised that I\u2019d support her, emotionally and financially, so she can make any dream of hers happen and we can finally move on. \n\nI expected to meet in the middle ground, acknowledge our respective mistakes and work together to grow our relationship. But, I was met with silence at first, a chuckle, and then she told me that I patronize her for offering to cover her bills, followed by her explaining that my support is a way to make myself feel better about my accomplishments, as if, and I quote, \u201cI can\u2019t make it on my f\\*ing own\u201d. She concluded that I was trying to manipulate the situation by acting like the good guy, and that in reality her current situation (professional and with her parents) is my doing. \n\nNow, some commenters from the previous post mentioned the above narrative, so I was very conflicted on how to answer the above in a non-condescending way and wanted to respect her feelings. The best thing I could think of was recommending couple\u2019s therapy, as per your recommendation, which she declined saying that throwing more money away won\u2019t make up for the emotional neglect. I couldn\u2019t answer here, mainly because I was on the verge of crying. After a few minutes of silence, I suggested ending the relationship and she instantly agreed. \n\nThank you *all* for your comments, they certainly added to me seeing things more spherically, and made me a better person than before.", "created_utc": 1693571209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1675qov/update_aita_because_i_told_my_fianc\u00e9_that_her/", "score": 154, "replies": ["I've read the previous post and the update and as hard as it may be to hear since you've been together so long, this is probably for the best.\n\nShe can't take accountability for herself, it's always going to be someone else's fault, everyone is always going to be against her. \n\nIf she can't see that her partner of 15 years is just trying to do the best he can to help her, even offering to support her so she can get where she wants, then there is literally nothing else you can do.\n\nSide note: not sure why but it feels like someone has been getting in her ear, telling her nothing is her fault, you're a crap partner who is just manipulating her, etc so U wouldn't be surprised if she ends up in another relationship pretty quickly, and then is back begging for you to take her back once she realises it was all bullshit just to get her to leave you.", "You are better off without her, OP. She isn't an adult yet and you are. She isn't willing to take acountability for her own mistakes and is blaming everyone but herself. You have an oportunity to meet someone in your level.", "I'm sorry for the ending of your relationship... regardless that it's probably for the better, that shit HURTS. Endings are always painful.\n\nI thought you sounded quiet reasonable and was shocked at her response, but it seems once again she can't take accountability for her situation and you don't want to end up in a lifetime of always being in the blame.\n\nSending hugs... might not seem like it right now but you will laugh again, smile and find love again. This too shall pass", "Dude she isnt an adult.  \nYou dodged a bullet.  \nBetter late than ever.  \nYou were putting much more into it than her.", "Maybe The same friends who were partying with her during college!", "I don't know if it will be another relationship,  but it definitely sounds like someone in her friend circle wants to keep her down,  either to keep her bellow themselves, or keeping her down in the mud with them. So nice to hear \"nothing is your fault, it's all someone else's, you have nothing to feel bad about.\" But it is literal poison in your ear.", "yeah very fair, it's definitely been poisoning the now ex GF if we are correct.", "Your life will be so much better off without her", "Unfortunate after so many years together but sounds like parting ways was for the best. Reading the prior post honestly a bit surprised you two made it through college still in a relationship", "I know this was really hard for you to do.  I sympathize with how much this must have broken your heart\n\nYou did the right thing for yourself and ultimately the right thing for her.  She can\u2019t grow into the adult she needs to be if she\u2019s coddled.  Everyone around her recognizes that", "I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s all come to this.  especially since, (in her mind) you are now the ex whose fault everything will be in future.     All those others played a part in everything but her new overarching poor me plot line will include you being a patronising manipulative person who just wanted to make himself look good for all these years.   \n\nAt least her parents understand the deal.", "NTA.\nSounds like your now ex-fianc\u00e9 never matured past her teen years.", "Looks like she was looking for a way out without taking any responsibility for it.", "dude is too weak and spineless. He would have ended up staying with this useless woman who can\u2019t ever take accountability for her actions. Couples counseling?", "Well, it's unfortunate but this is probably for the best. I hope she can get her stuff sorted out. Best of luck to you. You definitely tried.", "She instantly agreed to the breakup? Sounds like she was using him the whole time.", "It sounds like she's so incapable of recognising her own problems she'd rather believe anything negative of anyone else. She's essentially throwing all your support back in your face and twisting it into this ugly manipulation tactic. Where is her love for you in this? \n\nI'm so sorry that you've lost your relationship and (probably) lost some of the esteem and respect you once had for her. Take time to grieve and look after yourself. You deserve better than this, and well done for handling it the way you did.", "So you're neglecting her and also supporting her to patronize her? That's a bold take.", "Nope nope nope.\n\nShe's either got way too much pride or not enough brains to see the issues.\n\nThe fact that you had to apologize, as though you were in charge of her, you know, your ADULT girlfriend, before she would even slightly pretend to listen to you is gross. You did nothing wrong.\n\nShe ran away to her family's house, who also agreed, but SHE STILL ISN'T AT FAULT.\n\nShe isn't ready for marriage and YOU don't deserve being the punching bag for a baby lady who won't acknowledge that spending your time in college partying and hanging out with friends WON'T get you a degree.", "That\u2019s really sad. You approached it as diplomatically as you could and you weren\u2019t trying to boost your ego or demean her. You were really trying to help someone you love.\n\nUnfortunately her mindset is stuck on it being everyone else\u2019s fault. She can\u2019t take accountability. And it\u2019s a very painful shame that it\u2019s come to the destruction of such a long relationship. But you can\u2019t force her to change this if she\u2019s unwilling to listen to anyone. \n\nI read the original post and I had hoped for a better outcome, but I also hope you go forward and eventually meet someone who can take accountability for their choices.", "This. Right. Here. \n\nOP, I\u2019m so sorry this is how it ended up. She chose the narrative she wanted to but into and really I can\u2019t see how there\u2019s anyway you could win, even if you cared to that stress the victim poor her - she\u2019d allays say everything you do was showing off your money and success. \n\nBut man. That sucks. I know we all hope the people we love will make the choice towards being a better version of themselves and it\u2019s hard to watch them (and feel the effects of them) not do that.", "On the post where he stood up for himself?", "Says a random 14 year old"]}
