It was specific to the situation presented, and my phrasing was evidently poorly chosen. My mistakenly more abruptly phrased point was that she could\u2019ve made it in college, but didn\u2019t wish to, and while that\u2019s okay and completely up to her, she shouldn\u2019t blame others for how her career has advanced. \n\nI finally contacted my fianc\u00e9e and asked her to meet me so we could talk. Apparently, both her parents and her sister took my side on the matter (important for later). She had fled her parents\u2019 house and was living with a friend. I told her I love her and explained how I **didn\u2019t** mean to imply that she squandered her potential *irreversibly* and told her that I believe we can fix things if we work together. I apologized for my ill-tasted comment, and I repeatedly told her that my point was never to demean or disdain her, and that I do not consider her to be below me. I tried to explain that none of us obstructed her journey to success, and that we do not bare accountability for her academic path, but we are all here to support her. I encouraged her to try whatever she thinks is best right now, and promised that I\u2019d support her, emotionally and financially, so she can make any dream of hers happen and we can finally move on. \n\nI expected to meet in the middle ground, acknowledge our respective mistakes and work together to grow our relationship. But, I was met with silence at first, a chuckle, and then she told me that I patronize her for offering to cover her bills, followed by her explaining that my support is a way to make myself feel better about my accomplishments, as if, and I quote, \u201cI can\u2019t make it on my f\\*ing own\u201d. She concluded that I was trying to manipulate the situation by acting like the good guy, and that in reality her current situation (professional and with her parents) is my doing. \n\nNow, some commenters from the previous post mentioned the above narrative, so I was very conflicted on how to answer the above in a non-condescending way and wanted to respect her feelings. The best thing I could think of was recommending couple\u2019s therapy, as per your recommendation, which she declined saying that throwing more money away won\u2019t make up for the emotional neglect. I couldn\u2019t answer here, mainly because I was on the verge of crying. After a few minutes of silence, I suggested ending the relationship and she instantly agreed. \n\nThank you *all* for your comments, they certainly added to me seeing things more spherically, and made me a better person than before.", "created_utc": 1693571209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1675qov/update_aita_because_i_told_my_fianc\u00e9_that_her/", "score": 852, "replies": ["I've read the previous post and the update and as hard as it may be to hear since you've been together so long, this is probably for the best.\n\nShe can't take accountability for herself, it's always going to be someone else's fault, everyone is always going to be against her. \n\nIf she can't see that her partner of 15 years is just trying to do the best he can to help her, even offering to support her so she can get where she wants, then there is literally nothing else you can do.\n\nSide note: not sure why but it feels like someone has been getting in her ear, telling her nothing is her fault, you're a crap partner who is just manipulating her, etc so U wouldn't be surprised if she ends up in another relationship pretty quickly, and then is back begging for you to take her back once she realises it was all bullshit just to get her to leave you.", "You are better off without her, OP. She isn't an adult yet and you are. She isn't willing to take acountability for her own mistakes and is blaming everyone but herself. You have an oportunity to meet someone in your level.", "I'm sorry for the ending of your relationship... regardless that it's probably for the better, that shit HURTS. Endings are always painful.\n\nI thought you sounded quiet reasonable and was shocked at her response, but it seems once again she can't take accountability for her situation and you don't want to end up in a lifetime of always being in the blame.\n\nSending hugs... might not seem like it right now but you will laugh again, smile and find love again. This too shall pass", "Dude she isnt an adult.  \nYou dodged a bullet.  \nBetter late than ever.  \nYou were putting much more into it than her.", "Maybe The same friends who were partying with her during college!", "I don't know if it will be another relationship,  but it definitely sounds like someone in her friend circle wants to keep her down,  either to keep her bellow themselves, or keeping her down in the mud with them. So nice to hear \"nothing is your fault, it's all someone else's, you have nothing to feel bad about.\" But it is literal poison in your ear.", "yeah very fair, it's definitely been poisoning the now ex GF if we are correct.", "Your life will be so much better off without her", "Unfortunate after so many years together but sounds like parting ways was for the best. Reading the prior post honestly a bit surprised you two made it through college still in a relationship", "I know this was really hard for you to do.  I sympathize with how much this must have broken your heart\n\nYou did the right thing for yourself and ultimately the right thing for her.

Everyone around her recognizes that", "I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s all come to this.  especially since, (in her mind) you are now the ex whose fault everything will be in future.     All those others played a part in everything but her new overarching poor me plot line will include you being a patronising manipulative person who just wanted to make himself look good for all these years.   \n\nAt least her parents understand the deal.", "NTA.\nSounds like your now ex-fianc\u00e9 never matured past her teen years.", "Looks like she was looking for a way out without taking any responsibility for it.", "dude is too weak and spineless. He would have ended up staying with this useless woman who can\u2019t ever take accountability for her actions. Couples counseling?", "Well, it's unfortunate but this is probably for the best. I hope she can get her stuff sorted out. Best of luck to you. You definitely tried.", "She instantly agreed to the breakup? Sounds like she was using him the whole time.", "It sounds like she's so incapable of recognising her own problems she'd rather believe anything negative of anyone else. She's essentially throwing all your support back in your face and twisting it into this ugly manipulation tactic. Where is her love for you in this? \n\nI'm so sorry that you've lost your relationship and (probably) lost some of the esteem and respect you once had for her. Take time to grieve and look after yourself. You deserve better than this, and well done for handling it the way you did.", "So you're neglecting her and also supporting her to patronize her? That's a bold take.", "Nope nope nope.\n\nShe's either got way too much pride or not enough brains to see the issues.\n\nThe fact that you had to apologize, as though you were in charge of her, you know, your ADULT girlfriend, before she would even slightly pretend to listen to you is gross. You did nothing wrong.\n\nShe ran away to her family's house, who also agreed, but SHE STILL ISN'T AT FAULT.\n\nShe isn't ready for marriage and YOU don't deserve being the punching bag for a baby lady who won't acknowledge that spending your time in college partying and hanging out with friends WON'T get you a degree.", "That\u2019s really sad. You approached it as diplomatically as you could and you weren\u2019t trying to boost your ego or demean her. You were really trying to help someone you love.\n\nUnfortunately her mindset is stuck on it being everyone else\u2019s fault. She can\u2019t take accountability. And it\u2019s a very painful shame that it\u2019s come to the destruction of such a long relationship. But you can\u2019t force her to change this if she\u2019s unwilling to listen to anyone. \n\nI read the original post and I had hoped for a better outcome, but I also hope you go forward and eventually meet someone who can take accountability for their choices.", "This. Right. Here. \n\nOP, I\u2019m so sorry this is how it ended up. She chose the narrative she wanted to but into and really I can\u2019t see how there\u2019s anyway you could win, even if you cared to that stress the victim poor her - she\u2019d allays say everything you do was showing off your money and success. \n\nBut man. That sucks. I know we all hope the people we love will make the choice towards being a better version of themselves and it\u2019s hard to watch them (and feel the effects of them) not do that.", "On the post where he stood up for himself?", "Says a random 14 year old", "Dodged that bullet better than Neo in the Matrix. DO NOT get back together when she comes crawling back within a year.", "She was definitely one of those blame everyone else but themselves kind of person. She won\u2019t take accountability for herself cause in her mind it\u2019s everyone else\u2019s fault. You are very lucky to have your life together and I hope one day you\u2019ll meet someone who can match your energy. Breaking up was definitely the best choice here. The one that made me chuckle was when her parents agreed with you and she immediately left their house. She has A LOT of maturing to do and maybe without you being her net, she\u2019ll actually do it. Don\u2019t be surprised if she tries to contact you in the future though. Good luck and have a great life man!", "you dodged a bullet. she sounds insanely immature. it may hurt now but you'll eventually look back on this and laugh that you ever wasted your time on someone like her. good luck with everything\n\nedit: scratch the last part actually i went and looked at the previous post and how you'd been together 15 years, lol. yeah that's not something to just laugh at and dismiss. however you should still be grateful that you're still young and didn't get further entangled, through marriage or even kids. you got off easy", "I think she was done with this relationship a long time ago.", "Wow she is very stupid, sorry for your lost relationahip but hope you can move on quickly, her loss.", "I am sure I read it before. The Ant and the Grasshopper, is that your story, OP, or still by Aesop?", "NTA. She made her choices. She could have put more work in when she saw you doing it. She chose not to. That is on her. \n\nShe probably realises this, but it's easier to blame other people than face up to this. She made poor choices for what she wishes she could have now, but lots of people do that. It's not an irreversible process . She could make different choices now and do well. But to do this means three things:\n\n1. She has to stop blaming others, the universe, the weather. \n2. She has to put in the work\n3. She has to forgive herself for her own poor choices so she can move on\n\nOf course, she may be too comfortable where she is, or too afraid to make changes. She may simply think it's not worth it.", "You should congratulate yourself for not ending up married to a leech.", "Wow OP. \n\nI know you can\u2019t see this now maybe this is for the best. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like your ex has made any personal growth in 15 years. If she can\u2019t take responsibility for her actions then there\u2019s no point arguing with her. When she finally sees that actually this is all her own doing maybe she\u2019ll try to reconcile with you but even if she does she needs to accept that she hurt you and held you down. \n\nShe needs to own up and fix her mistakes. \n\nI hope you find peace happiness OP.", "In the end, she flatly refused to accept any responsibility for her life decisions... which is sad.  She wanted to have fun, and she had it. It's unfortunate, and it's probably for the best that the two of you have ended that relationship.", "It sucks to be in this situation but you sound like a great guy who did the best to support your gf. But people who refuse to see their own fault and blame everyone else eventually become a burden to live with. It's best to stay away from such people. People who make effort, even if they fail again and again, as long as they are not discouraged by it are far better to invest your time and effort into.", "Congrats on your new freedom. It may seem hard now but this is good for you. She lacks sense of accountability and is determined to cast you into the monster role to not admit she partied away her stable future. Her family is on your side too, as would any counselor, which she wouldn\u2019t have liked. She needs to work on herself first before she can sustain an actual adult relationship. If she\u2019s lucky, she\u2019ll one day realise you were a good partner and she threw you away.", "That really sucks, but people who can never recognize their problems will never be able to fix them. It's easier to blame others than to acknowledge your own faults and do the work to fix it.", "This must really suck but you can walk away with your chin up knowing you tried your absolute best. On to a brighter future my friend.", "Maybe she has some other way out of this lined up (her parents saying they will support her?), but the fact that she agreed to leave you when you were and would have continued to support her financially is maybe a sign of some maturity and growth. Guess you\u2019ll see how it plays out.", "You did what was best. She was never going to agree or take accountability. That shows poor character. Immaturity. As for anyone who was offended how you worded things. That\u2019s on them. You were talking about you. How you felt academics was the priority. And it worked for you. If someone reads that and thinks man this guy is putting us all down? That\u2019s their own insecurities. I read your first post and thought good for you! You knew what you wanted and went for it. You showed a dedication that is to be admired. Now you are free to find a woman who is on your maturity level. \nI once complained my career was stagnant. I had to take shitty hours because I was a mom first. Could t go full time because kids. One day my husband sat me down and said I was the only one holding me back. He would work with whatever I needed.  I got mad. Said he didn\u2019t understand! But he was right. I had a partner who was willing to do whatever it took to meet my goals. It was a bitter pill to swallow. But swallow I did! Lol. And now I\u2019m happier. It was my own fears and insecurity holding me back and I used excuses to blame it on.", "She wanted to you to break up with her.  So now it's NOT HER FAULT.  I'm sorry and I hope you find someone who fulfills all your dreams and wishes.  \n\nThere was not one thing you didn't try.  You are a good person!  NTA", "So NTA. Ex GF sounds like a gold medal winner in the Mental Gymnastics.", "My God. The whole, you're just trying to look like the good guy so you can win the argument claim is just bonkers. How can you have so little faith in your partner that you believe them to be so disingenuous. Frankly it's insulting. She's throwing away a wonderful partner who would support her through a complete reinvention of her life simply because she's too prideful to admit she has any role to play in her current situation. \n\nBonkers, just bonkers.\n\nI know it must be hard to have such a huge part of your life come to an end, but truly this is for the best. Proud of you for extending the olive branch, and for not grovelling when it was swatted away. You're gonna do just fine, I don't doubt it for a second.", "I'm sorry that happened to you. But in the long run it's probably for the best. If she hasn't learned to own up to her own mistakes by now, you'd be dealing with that for years to come.", "Bullet dodged.", "Aww, that's a shame that the relationship ended over this.  It doesn't sound like there was anything you could say or do to fix the situation since she wasn't even willing to listen or admit her part in the situation.  Maybe this will be the wakeup call she needs to start adulting a bit better?  \nShe may wakeup realizing you aren't an AH and try to get in touch with you.  I'd suggest resisting the temptation to rekindle the relationship since you already know how it'll end.", "When she comes running back do not take her back. She has shown that she cannot take accountability for her life. That should be the biggest deal breaker, red flag, all of the above. I know it may hurt right now but please be secure in knowing you dodged the largest bullet and that this is one door closing for another better one to open. This IS NOT a loss, even if right now it may feel that way.", "It is time to let her go, some break ups are for the best, she was just looking for a  excuse to ending things. You are so young, I am sure, that you will found the real One, but therapy can always help. You were never the AH.", "This is for the best.  Trying to build a life and family with someone who actively self-sabotages like she does is an exercise in frustration and futility.  Let her go and self-sabotage where it can't drag you down.", "Now she lost her long term relationship too lol", "Wow, \u2018someone getting in her ear telling her nothing is her fault\u2019 sounded charming, like she\u2019s captured by some little angry fairy. Guess  you didn\u2019t mean it but thanks, I\u2019m obsessed with this idea now!", "Because no woman is capable of making a bad decision. There has to be a malicious man, or a worse woman, manipulating her. She can\u2019t possibly just be blinded by arrogance.", "Was going to say this exact thing!", "I think she may be so narcissistic that she thought he was bluffing and he will come back begging her in a couple of days.", "I think so too, and wanted to make OP the bad guy for dumping her.", "There doesn't have to be anyone whispering in her ear. It could be that the easiest thing for her to do is blame others and throw herself a pity party, rather than acknowledge that she played a big part in her current circumstances, eat humble pie and ask OP and her family to help her work on changing things.\n\nAnd in another 10years if her life still hasn't met her expectations, she'll probably go on and on to everyone who'll listen about how OP wasted the best years of her life and then threw her aside. She might even take credit for OP's success and claim she sacrificed her dreams to support his and then he dropped her when he no longer needed her.\n\nI have seen in action various versions of this particular story way too many times. People who had grand ideas about how their life would be but never did anything to try and make that happen. In the meantime, people they consider less than (brains, looks etc) worked their butts off and their lives turned out great. Rather than admit they and their life choices are to blame for their current circumstances. And since they can't make peace with people who are \"less than them\" seemingly now being \"better than them\", they come up with all sorts of narratives that place blame on everyone and everything but themselves.\n\nEdited. Changed how I phrased some things in that last paragraph.", "You did the right thing for yourself and ultimately the right thing for her.

You never fully know a person but after 15 years you know them fairly well. Because of that it leads to a reasonable conclusion that she has some one whispering in her ear. It\u2019s not necessarily the case, and I highly doubt it was a man, but it is likely the friend she\u2019s staying with is being fed a story and is building the gf up based on that story.", "Yes, kinda girl traded her heart for beauty.
