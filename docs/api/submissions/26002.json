It was specific to the situation presented, and my phrasing was evidently poorly chosen. My mistakenly more abruptly phrased point was that she could\u2019ve made it in college, but didn\u2019t wish to, and while that\u2019s okay and completely up to her, she shouldn\u2019t blame others for how her career has advanced. \n\nI finally contacted my fianc\u00e9e and asked her to meet me so we could talk. Apparently, both her parents and her sister took my side on the matter (important for later). She had fled her parents\u2019 house and was living with a friend. I told her I love her and explained how I **didn\u2019t** mean to imply that she squandered her potential *irreversibly* and told her that I believe we can fix things if we work together. I apologized for my ill-tasted comment, and I repeatedly told her that my point was never to demean or disdain her, and that I do not consider her to be below me. I tried to explain that none of us obstructed her journey to success, and that we do not bare accountability for her academic path, but we are all here to support her. I encouraged her to try whatever she thinks is best right now, and promised that I\u2019d support her, emotionally and financially, so she can make any dream of hers happen and we can finally move on. \n\nI expected to meet in the middle ground, acknowledge our respective mistakes and work together to grow our relationship. But, I was met with silence at first, a chuckle, and then she told me that I patronize her for offering to cover her bills, followed by her explaining that my support is a way to make myself feel better about my accomplishments, as if, and I quote, \u201cI can\u2019t make it on my f\\*ing own\u201d. She concluded that I was trying to manipulate the situation by acting like the good guy, and that in reality her current situation (professional and with her parents) is my doing. \n\nNow, some commenters from the previous post mentioned the above narrative, so I was very conflicted on how to answer the above in a non-condescending way and wanted to respect her feelings. The best thing I could think of was recommending couple\u2019s therapy, as per your recommendation, which she declined saying that throwing more money away won\u2019t make up for the emotional neglect. I couldn\u2019t answer here, mainly because I was on the verge of crying. After a few minutes of silence, I suggested ending the relationship and she instantly agreed. \n\nThank you *all* for your comments, they certainly added to me seeing things more spherically, and made me a better person than before.", "created_utc": 1693571209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1675qov/update_aita_because_i_told_my_fianc\u00e9_that_her/", "score": 3464, "replies": ["I've read the previous post and the update and as hard as it may be to hear since you've been together so long, this is probably for the best.\n\nShe can't take accountability for herself, it's always going to be someone else's fault, everyone is always going to be against her. \n\nIf she can't see that her partner of 15 years is just trying to do the best he can to help her, even offering to support her so she can get where she wants, then there is literally nothing else you can do.\n\nSide note: not sure why but it feels like someone has been getting in her ear, telling her nothing is her fault, you're a crap partner who is just manipulating her, etc so U wouldn't be surprised if she ends up in another relationship pretty quickly, and then is back begging for you to take her back once she realises it was all bullshit just to get her to leave you.", "You are better off without her, OP.

It's not an irreversible process . She could make different choices now and do well. But to do this means three things:\n\n1. She has to stop blaming others, the universe, the weather. \n2. She has to put in the work\n3. She has to forgive herself for her own poor choices so she can move on\n\nOf course, she may be too comfortable where she is, or too afraid to make changes.

On to a brighter future my friend.", "Maybe she has some other way out of this lined up (her parents saying they will support her?), but the fact that she agreed to leave you when you were and would have continued to support her financially is maybe a sign of some maturity and growth.

If someone reads that and thinks man this guy is putting us all down? That\u2019s their own insecurities. I read your first post and thought good for you! You knew what you wanted and went for it. You showed a dedication that is to be admired. Now you are free to find a woman who is on your maturity level. \nI once complained my career was stagnant. I had to take shitty hours because I was a mom first. Could t go full time because kids. One day my husband sat me down and said I was the only one holding me back. He would work with whatever I needed.  I got mad. Said he didn\u2019t understand! But he was right. I had a partner who was willing to do whatever it took to meet my goals.

How can you have so little faith in your partner that you believe them to be so disingenuous. Frankly it's insulting.

It doesn't sound like there was anything you could say or do to fix the situation since she wasn't even willing to listen or admit her part in the situation.

I'd suggest resisting the temptation to rekindle the relationship since you already know how it'll end.", "When she comes running back do not take her back. She has shown that she cannot take accountability for her life. That should be the biggest deal breaker, red flag, all of the above.

It could be that the easiest thing for her to do is blame others and throw herself a pity party, rather than acknowledge that she played a big part in her current circumstances, eat humble pie and ask OP and her family to help her work on changing things.\n\nAnd in another 10years if her life still hasn't met her expectations, she'll probably go on and on to everyone who'll listen about how OP wasted the best years of her life and then threw her aside. She might even take credit for OP's success and claim she sacrificed her dreams to support his and then he dropped her when he no longer needed her.\n\nI have seen in action various versions of this particular story way too many times. People who had grand ideas about how their life would be but never did anything to try and make that happen. In the meantime, people they consider less than (brains, looks etc) worked their butts off and their lives turned out great. Rather than admit they and their life choices are to blame for their current circumstances.

The one thought that mystifies me is, how on earth did it stall at this point when you're both 29, when you've landed that high-paying job, you're engaged..? Like, I can see an alternative scenario where at this point you get married, have kids, your wife concentrates on looking after the kids for a bunch of years and hey, she probably works again at some point but the lack of a masters degree is neither here nor there. Maybe you two didn't want kids, maybe there were other issues I don't know about.

Sad thing is, that by the time she figures out that she is her own problem it will be too late to make amends with the person willing to give her his all so she could succeed in life.  I know it sucks now, but in the long run it will be better for you.  No matter the support you would have given, she would not have made the changes to get some where in life because it's clear she's not ready to fully grow up.  In the end she would have ended up bragging you down, back, and costing you more emotionally, mentally, as well as financially.", "I missed your original post the first time around and just got to it before reading this update.

I'm so sorry that the relationship has ended after so long, and I know it must hurt, but I genuinely believe you made the right decision.  You have a different locus of control than your ex - some people make things happen, but for others, things happen to them.

Like...her bad grades in school...the only way those are her teachers' faults is if nobody refused to help her from the school when she asked. That's on her. You offered couples therapy, which is a good start. She refused. Sounds like she needs it, though.

I helped get her a job with the organization I worked for. She didn't make it a year before she got a DUI. She blamed me for that, but was also angry at the cop for not cutting her a break. I had to drive her to and from work (we worked at different sites about 90 minutes apart). She eventually was fired for lying about the charge, so that meant I had to cover everything and ended up taking on huge amounts of overtime. She lied to her family about what was going on and why I was never around. In the midst of this, I failed to achieve my major life goal and she relished it. Said she was happy I failed for a change. Blamed me for failing to do more with her life. She applied to go back to school (generals in prep for a career change) and I paid for her classes out of pocket. I tried to help her do well and she would only get angry about it. All I ever did was try to support her. In the end, she doubled down and told me she regretted ever meeting me and that I was the thing holding her back from success. I made another run at my career goal, but her criminal record, despite being minor, prevented that. We eventually split and it was not amicable. She told me she didn't even see the point of remaining friends. Five years later, she never completed her education, still works the same job, and likely still sees it as my fault.
