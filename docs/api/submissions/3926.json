It honestly opened my eyes about how much I've been allowing people in life to get over on me so easily for far too long - and I mean that in terms of a lot of people throughout my life, not just this situation in particular. \n\nAs awful as it sounds, I truly believed I was going to be the AH in the situation when I posted it - yet it wasn't the response I recieved at all. For that, I want to thank everyone who took their time to reply to my post. You helped in opening my eyes to the boundaries I needed to create in my life going forward. \n\nThe day I posted it, I decided to put my foot down with not cooking dinner unless the dishes were done and not washing laundry that wasn't properly placed in the hamper on laundry day, and I stuck with it. \n\nTo my surprise, things began running smoothly!\n\nThough things were seemingly running smoothly again, my husband and I were beginning to miss our own privacy and space. My husband and BIL were beginning to not get along and we realized he was doing nothing to save money to move when his living with us was supposed to be very temporary. So we decided we were going to give him a date to move out by.\n\nThe day we were going to give him the date, I woke up to a status BIL had posted on Facebook stating that the last 3 months had been filled with depression and starvation and it had caused him to lose a great amount of weight. \n\nWhich I was extremely taken aback by and honestly hurt. I have spent a lot of time making new and elaborate recipes.  My husband and I still cannot figure out what prompted him to post it in the first place. \n\nSo, I not only confronted him about it by commenting on his post, but in person as well. I asked him, \"So you're starving?\" Where he looked me straight in my face and said, \"yes.\" I honestly couldn't have been more dumbfounded. There were a lot of words exchanged, mostly by me, and my husband told him it was best to keep his mouth shut. \n\nI suppose now would be a good time to note that BIL is known for his pathological lying - though I'm unsure how anyone can lie to someone who's literally been cooking their meals on almost a nightly basis.\n\nWhen I dropped them off at work that morning, my husband told him he had a week to move out, but BIL ultimately decided to move out that night when they returned home from work. \n\nI was honestly hopeful to give a 100% perfect and peaceful update. Though I suppose in hindsight, it is. We now have our home, privacy, and peace of mind back. Our home is running more smoothly than ever and my husband and I can continue on our path of a happily ever after.", "created_utc": 1670158679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc98ge/update_aita_for_refusing_to_make_dinner_for_my/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Sounds like the excess baggage removed itself. Good news!", "INFO: So is your husband going to pick up the slack & cook for you sometimes and find his own transportation to and from work? Or is it him doing the bare minimum of making sure dishes are washed before you cook and dirty clothes are where they need to be?", "Great for you and hubby!", "Good news is always nice to hear.", ">I suppose now would be a good time to note that BIL is known for his pathological lying - though I'm unsure how anyone can lie to someone who's literally been cooking their meals on almost a nightly basis.\n\nPathological liars can lie to anyone about anything even if they care for that person. I used to have a friend that I saw like a brother and he was a pathological liar - some of the shit he'd come out with was ridiculous and easily proven false but he'd still do it.", "Glad you stood up for yourself.\nAnd that the garbage has put itself out.", "YTA", "As stated in my original post, things were not like this prior to BIL moving in. He offers to cook, however I prefer to do the cooking on my own.  We have one vehicle and I work the same hours as him - so dropping him off at work and picking him up isn't an issue. We cannot currently afford a second vehicle and rideshare options are out of the question. \n\nHe has been helping me greatly around the house, outside of keeping dishes cleaned and clothes off the floor.  Sweeping, mopping, trash, toilet cleaning, etc. \n\nI am fulfilled doing all of the things I do and he fulfills me in the emotional and mental ways I personally seek.\n\nThis was only a (thankfully) temporary issue - not an overall view of our marriage.", "That\u2019s the thing about cooking, it\u2019s not just a chore it\u2019s a skill, my partner cooks some things very well, but I wouldn\u2019t expect him to match my skill and interest. \n\nIn other news the air fryer Brussel sprouts I made last night absolutely slapped.", "Calling it \"helping\" though...it isn't.  The house is BOTH of your responsibilities.  He's doing what he's supposed to, not above and beyond.  Please value your time as much as you value his.", "And I think that's why I prefer to do the cooking. It's not that he can't cook - but I enjoy doing the meals that call for big recipes and he's honestly not the type that enjoys reading directions or measuring properly. He'd rather just wing it - which is fine! I was honestly a \"just wing it\" cooker until this past year. \n\nHe truly does offer to cook often and I politely decline. I enjoy cooking. \n\nHe does help me with stirring and shredding when I need the help. I have RA and my hands don't allow me to do things so easily sometimes, even as simple as stiring brownie mix. Those moments I don't even have to ask for help. He'll automatically step in and do it himself.", "It's just the way I word it and there's no need to look too deeply into it. He does plenty of his share and I do mine.", "That\u2019s sounds so sweet. I\u2019m so glad you worked this out together.", "Just want you to be treated well!", "Thank you! \ud83e\udd17", "I am, no worries \ud83e\udd17 I honestly wish I could paint a full picture of our relationship, from beginning to now. It is by far the best and healthiest relationship I've ever been in. I've referred to it often as a fairy tale because it truly does feel too good to be true sometimes. \n\nI think it just goes to show that even in the happiest of relationships/marriages, there's going to be moments that aren't ideal along the way and frustrations you'll have to work through. No one will ever be perfect and that's okay. You just have to find the one you're willing to work through the hard times with."]}
