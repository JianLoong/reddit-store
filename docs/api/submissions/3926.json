It honestly opened my eyes about how much I've been allowing people in life to get over on me so easily for far too long - and I mean that in terms of a lot of people throughout my life, not just this situation in particular. \n\nAs awful as it sounds, I truly believed I was going to be the AH in the situation when I posted it - yet it wasn't the response I recieved at all. For that, I want to thank everyone who took their time to reply to my post. You helped in opening my eyes to the boundaries I needed to create in my life going forward. \n\nThe day I posted it, I decided to put my foot down with not cooking dinner unless the dishes were done and not washing laundry that wasn't properly placed in the hamper on laundry day, and I stuck with it. \n\nTo my surprise, things began running smoothly!\n\nThough things were seemingly running smoothly again, my husband and I were beginning to miss our own privacy and space. My husband and BIL were beginning to not get along and we realized he was doing nothing to save money to move when his living with us was supposed to be very temporary. So we decided we were going to give him a date to move out by.\n\nThe day we were going to give him the date, I woke up to a status BIL had posted on Facebook stating that the last 3 months had been filled with depression and starvation and it had caused him to lose a great amount of weight. \n\nWhich I was extremely taken aback by and honestly hurt. I have spent a lot of time making new and elaborate recipes.  My husband and I still cannot figure out what prompted him to post it in the first place. \n\nSo, I not only confronted him about it by commenting on his post, but in person as well. I asked him, \"So you're starving?\" Where he looked me straight in my face and said, \"yes.\" I honestly couldn't have been more dumbfounded. There were a lot of words exchanged, mostly by me, and my husband told him it was best to keep his mouth shut. \n\nI suppose now would be a good time to note that BIL is known for his pathological lying - though I'm unsure how anyone can lie to someone who's literally been cooking their meals on almost a nightly basis.\n\nWhen I dropped them off at work that morning, my husband told him he had a week to move out, but BIL ultimately decided to move out that night when they returned home from work. \n\nI was honestly hopeful to give a 100% perfect and peaceful update. Though I suppose in hindsight, it is. We now have our home, privacy, and peace of mind back. Our home is running more smoothly than ever and my husband and I can continue on our path of a happily ever after.", "created_utc": 1670158679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc98ge/update_aita_for_refusing_to_make_dinner_for_my/", "score": 3462, "replies": ["Sounds like the excess baggage removed itself.
