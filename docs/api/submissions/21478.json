I never really thought of her as a friend at the time, just another employee that I work with, but then she reached out on social media and we started talking. \nWe used to meet up quite often, go for coffee or go out for food, my ex was a dick so I would often go to hers to rant. So this continued for a couple of years and naturally we became quite close. 12 months before her original wedding date (got cancelled twice due to COVID) she made me aware that her best friend had fallen out with her and she had demoted her from maid of honour, would I like to be it? I said yes because I couldn't let her down. I sorted out her hen do, payments for it, cancellations due to COVID, have up my boyfriend's birthday to see her try on dresses and also made her wedding cake which she paid less than a third of the price for.\n\nFast forward, I've moved away, at least 90 minutes from her to live with my boyfriend. We tried hard to keep seeing each other but it was very one sided and I started to get frustrated paying for a lot of diesel every month to go and visit her. She has 2 miscarriages and then tells me she's pregnant, obviously I'm overjoyed but I'm also making sure she's at her healthiest (which she really isn't) and I try to make her aware of this. Contact dwindles and we both struggle to see each other due to distance and life being in the way, but I always make sure that I text her to see how she is. 2 months pass and nothing...she posts on socials that she's having a boy so I reach out and congratulate her to which I receive an essay on how I've not been there for her or the baby, how I've been a shit friend and why am I messaging her.\n\nI explain I've tried, but life is in the way and I can't afford to keep driving 90 minutes to go and visit her. She flips, says she can't go out anymore, pregnancy is really difficult etc. I completely side with her, it must be hard worrying about a baby you're carrying when you've already lost two.. but this is not on me. She then blocks me everywhere! Without reason and makes her husband block me.\n\nI contact her ex best friend to see what happened to them and low and behold....she did the same to her!!\n\nSo, she's had the baby, my boyfriend showed me the pictures which means she didn't block him and I want to congratulate her but also... I don't want to be in that position again!", "created_utc": 1688643877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s6qgu/aita_for_saying_how_shit_my_friend_was_to_her/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being pregnant, disabled (Inb4, I\u2019m saying this as an example bc I was born disabled, anyone can be an asshole), what-have-you doesn\u2019t mean you get to treat everyone at your own discretion at their expense. There are no get-out-of-jail-free cards in friendships.", "Nta, but it might be time to consider this friendship over, esp if she has a oattern of blowing through people.", "NTA\n\nSometimes a friendship doesn't work out for a reason and sometimes a friendship drains more than it gives. \n\nIf you've been blocked, maybe it's best to leave it there. Last thing you need is to be on the receiving end of more essays and abuse. \n\nAlso I now want greggs. A sausage roll sounds delightful \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nFriendship goes both ways", "She had two miscarriages and is severely overweight, to which the doctors had made her aware. So I suggested vitamins to her to help with the pregnancy, we exchanged better cooking techniques and meals that would potentially be better for her but insisted that home cooked chips and pizza was fine... \n\nEncouraging her to go on walks, I wanted her to be healthy and have less chances of another miscarriage.", "And did she actually ask you for this help/input?\n\nWho initiated the monthly visits? Was it that she just never made plans to come see you? Did she ask for you to come monthly or did you just think that was what was needed? As someone who has many long distance friendships, I\u2019m not sure why a monthly visit would be necessary.", "She asked me what potentially would help improve the ability to carry. I offered my suggestions but told her ultimately the doctors would know \n\nIt was never a thing to have monthly visits, that's just what it ended up becoming because we could never arrange a time that was suitable. So she suggested we do monthly visits to keep in touch, I explained to her that my only free days were weekends and she said hers were weekdays. So I mentioned to her that we text and call each other often enough that visiting each other isn't a priority as long as we're supporting each other. \n\nI have plenty of long distance friendships too, and one of them I only see twice a year but we talk a lot. \nMay I add I'm also 32 and have had my fair share of fall outs with friends but have always been fine after. \n\n I was always that one that had to visit, I would arrange to meet up half way or to fund her train ticket if needed but I always had to drive to her or to somewhere near her. Which meant it was a 3 hour round trip by the time I was done. This was fine for a while but consistently.", "I agree then, NTA, but it seems like your friend needs to be a better communicator and you need to work on communicating boundaries. It\u2019s probably easier for me, as an American, to say that because I know people in the UK tend to use less direct communication. I would just respect that she\u2019s blocked you and move on-it really sucks that you may not have closure, but I would really try to just move past it.", "Honestly, to me it sounds like you reminded her too much of her losses. Like perhaps she feels like the advice you\u2019re giving her was making her feel like it was her fault. Plus while you guys are talking about your friendship, you bring up the losses again. That\u2019s pretty insensitive. \n\nI\u2019m not calling you the asshole, but I think you\u2019re not fully seeing the impact these miscarriages have had on her, and your friendship.", "This person has a habit of blocking friends the second the friendship hits a hurdle or needs more effort from both sides. I would enjoy the memories of the friendship you had and let her go. She's not worth reaching out to again. Maybe stay in touch with her ex-best friend. She's been in your position before and maybe you can build a friendship with her. NTA", "NTA, it's sad and it hurts but the friendship is over. Let it go.", "NTA. She sounds like a toxic person.", "NTA. Also I note she had fallen out with her best friend. Does she cycle through people?\n\n I've known a few of those - the friendship goes one way. You give and don't get anything back. You get a bit tired of the pattern and they dump you for not being there for them enough. Good riddance!", "NTA at all!  Could it maybe be pregnancy hormones? I read some of your comments about her not putting any effort in and honestly it sounds like the friendship was very one sided, might be best to let this one go!", "NTA. Book it.", "Let it go. She can't hold you back anymoreeeee \ud83c\udfb6", "I believe so. I was just the next in line. \n\nShitty because shouldn't be about who is there physically the most... I supported her a lot and looking back she never wanted to listen to my \"issues\" .", "The correct answer to \"how can I be healthier\" is generally \"you should talk to your doctor about it and see what they suggest\", particularly during pregnancy when there can be a lot of medical considerations. \n\nI will say though that pregnancy is exhausting in the first and final trimester, and pregnancy after loss can be hugely anxiety inducing, hormones going haywire. \n\nSo overall I'm going with NAH. But she's no loss to you really and I wouldn't bother reaching out again."]}
