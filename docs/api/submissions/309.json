The first few months were truly great-that was until he joined a popular GTA role-playing server (I won't disclose which one for privacy reasons)\n\nSince joining in March this year he spends most of his nights for hours on end playing the game, sometimes staying on until 4 or 5am our time, even when I have work in the morning. Today my boyfriend was doing the same thing as usual, on the game, except this time he ran into a girl who he had previously encountered in the game, we'll call her S.\n\nS and him have had banter previously about him taking her gun, except this time she was on the top of a bridge sat down. As my partner is PD in the game he went over and asked her to come down ect ect. This is where the flirting ensures, or at least what I deemed to be so.\n\nHe was saying such things like 'if you ever think about coming up here again I'll drag you back down myself' alongside 'I'll make you laugh so hard next time that you'll be trying not to fall off of the bridge'\n\nOver the time of them talking, I began sighing to myself. Right as he dropped her off home after another joke he must have heard me sigh, aggressively took his headset off and asked me what was wrong?\n\nI sat in silence not sure what to say until a minute later when he came to ask me again, to which I said 'you're crossing lines now' he asked with what? And I just said the flirting on the game.\nIt was from then that he said 'I thought you'd think I was better than that' and that 'you know I'm friendly on the games'\n\nI just said it was beginning to make me feel uncomfortable because it's like this every night, and he just sat back down on his PC. \n\nWe're now sat not talking to each other, so I must just ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1667262313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yitmsp/aita_for_feeling_uncomfortable_with_my_boyfriend/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
