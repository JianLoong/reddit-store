I admit that falls on me.\n\nLast month she messaged me and decided she wants to live here instead. We struggled financially a few years ago and seriously downsized our house - it's now a two-bed. My wife and I sleep on the couches, oldest and youngest with their own rooms.\n\nI was hesitant, but after talking with my older daughter, agreed to have her come over and share with her sister. She arrived and immediately hated everything about the house.\n\nShe doesn't like our decor, our furniture isn't comfortable, our house isn't clean enough. The food we make is weird, the AC isn't strong enough. She's driving us a little mad.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is her despising sharing with her sister.

I told her she was being a brat and that she didn't get to fuck off for six years, come home, and then run the house. She broke down and asked my ex to fly her back to them. Her flight is tomorrow.\n\nI have apologised to her - I'm not a yeller. I've always prided myself on not yelling or hitting my kids, ever. Yesterday was the only time I have ever yelled.

She doesn't.\n\nBut leave your resentment at the fact that she lived with your ex for 6 years and you didn't bother to visit all the way the fuck out of it and sure as hell do not make that out to be *her* fault.", "YTA. \n\n\"Fuck off for six years?\" She was NINE and was inappropriately asked by her parents to choose who to live with (as was your older child). YOU failed to visit her for six years. She is not responsible for that. You are also responsible for not enforcing any court ordered parenting plans you had for long distance visiting if you didn't have her come to you (not that you had room for her). Or challenging the long distance move if it was going to impede your ability to have a relationship with your child.", "Probably could have been a little gentler about it, maybe had a few convos about her attitude before it got to the overload stage, but the point is the same. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to call the shots in your home. You are the adult, she is the child. It sounds like she got used to being the only kid at your ex\u2019s place (assuming ex doesn\u2019t have other kids) that she felt a little entitled to things going her way.", "I think the issue people should be focusing on isn't that you're upset about your daughter being distant for the last few years. It's been established that you have tried to be patient and have offered different solutions to some of the issues that she's had.\n\nThe issue is that she has decided to live with someone she hadn't even visited in the last few years, and decided that she wants things to be how she likes them to be.\n\nYes, you need to understand that she was a kid and that it's really healthy that she's decided to live with you (Unless she did that because she was mad at your ex or something, but I don't know about any of that so I can't judge.) She is a kid and is learning, so maybe yelling wasn't the best approach.\n\nHowever, not everyone can be a perfect parent. Looking at your comments I can see that you spend time with your kids and work as much as you can to provide for the 4-5 person home. Your wife works as well. You both make an effort to be with your children and you are actively growing alongside your children, as evident by you teaching your son about privacy instead of hoping he'll get the hang of things on his own. It's also awesome of you to have called as often as you did, I don't even get to talk to my dad as much as you do with your daughter.\n\nYour daughter is at an age where she should be able to understand that she is complaining about you doing your best. You are literally sleeping on the uncomfortable couch and her only concern is that she doesn't like sharing a room with her sister? And she expects her teenage sister and brother to share a room with one another? This expectation would make her the only person with her own room and bed and living area, whereas you all would need to share uncomfortable living spaces.\n\nRemember, you needed to ask her sister if she would share her room with her little sister. Your younger daughter is new to the household, she does not have any claim to specific living spaces over that which your other children have. I think that you telling her she doesn't get to change everything as it pleases her especially seeing as she's just gotten there and is only thinking if herself was valid. She is at a point in her life where she needs to learn this kind of stuff. NTA.", "Soft esh. Both you and your daughter were in classic no-win situations. \n\nWhatever is going on in your ex's house was bad enough to play the \"I'm going to live with dad\" card. You should gave found out why she did that. In any case your ex is not as bad as being sleep deprived and living with a dad who now shouts at her. Hopefully. \n\nYou are clearly at the end of your tether and need some help. I think you have to get help from your parents or other family. At the very least with settling your daughter, but hopefully also some respite  for you and your wife.", "INFO\n\n>  our house isn't clean enough\n\nI understand downsizing, and maybe even adjusting to a new cuisine, but why isn't your house clean?", "YTA for the \"fuck off for six years\" comment but really nothing else. She's a child, she can't help a lot of her situation. I understand your anger though, and this seems like a shitty situation, and it's probably just better for everyone if she lives with her mom. Your living situation just doesn't seem well to accommodate her, you know? I hope all goes well with this situation moving forward, OP.", "NTA\n\nYour responsibility to your kids is to make sure they are healthy and have the best opportunities you can give them. They don't get to dictate life in your home. They especially don't get to demand that you change your entire life to fit their desires.\n\nWhile yelling at your daughter isn't optimal, sometimes kids don't respond to their parents until they do yell. You apologized, because you had bad feelings about what you did, and that's just doing the best you can to model good behavior.\n\nParenting is a hard job, and I don't think you're the asshole here.", "Why do people keep saying he abandoned her? What I understand is that he could not afford to see her its not that he abandoned her its that he could not see her due to money problems when you have no money you can't just fly across the nation if you can't pay for tickets.\n\nOver all NTA but the comment about her fucking off for 6 years was TA it was said in a moment of anger but it is still wrong. \n \nShe is an entitled pice of work and she needs to learn the would dose not spin around her.", "NTA for the situation. It\u2019s sounds really tough and you\u2019ve just been trying your best. \n \nYTA for the shouting though, but you know that.", "NTA. What are you feeling guilty for? Because you yelled? Please. Someone needed to put your daughter's entitled attitude in check and you did just that. My guess is she wanted to come live with you because her mom put her in check as well. If your parents are so angry they can take her and listen to her nonstop complaining. Until they do they can stfu and have a happy day. Good on you for standing on your point though.", "Yta", "NTA you gave what you have, which isn't much, you tried.", "I'm going to go with a more gentle ESH because this is a difficult situation, and hard to navigate no matter what you did.\n\nYou definitely are YTA for saying that to your daughter, and the way you said it,  because she will remember that moment for the rest of her life. I really think you need to address it asap because it could be the end of your relationship with her if you let her go like that.\n\nBut your daughter is also YTA for the shit she is pulling. I feel bad for her, I wonder what might be going on in her life before she came to you, what 14 -15 year old decideds to up and haul ass across the country to live with a parent they haven't seen in 6 years, in a 2 bedroom house with 5 people, away from all their friends and their school and their daily normal, just like that? I mean, she is still being really rude and difficult, seemingly on purpose too, have you spoken to her about if there is/was anything going on? Her behaviour reads like a child in crisis. \n\nI really hope this works out well for you OP, you seem like you are trying your best to keep it all together but the constant friction and frustration had led to this unfortunate emotional explosion. Do you have anyone who can support you through this? You're wife seems to have checked out on you, do you have family and friends you could talk to?", "Nta. \nShe knew the living situation before she moved in. She's a child and does not get to call the shots. She needs to learn her place and she did. Tough love. \nAs for the whole blaming yourself for not seeing her often, usually it's up to the parent who moved away to provide funds for the transportation of the child. Seeing as they are the ones who moved away...or at least that's how it is where I am.", "ESH\n\nObviously you\u2019re stressed OP as your home life isn\u2019t ideal and your comments to your daughter weren\u2019t exactly the best. \n\nAt the same time she needed to be told that she doesn\u2019t get to dictate how you live your lives. You are still the parent and she needed to respect you and the rest of the family and not make demands.", "NTA\n\nI don't quite understand the Y T A or E S H votes, tbh.", "NTA", "NTA.

On what planet are you n t a?!", "YTA - Not for the situation but how you handled it. Despite how big of a change this felt for you, it was a far bigger chnage for your daughter.

Yeah you didn\u2019t visit but you called.", "YTA she didn't \"fuck off for 6 years\", you abandoned her for fucking 6 years.

You failed her as a father, don't put that on her", "ESH\n\nShe was being a brat, I'll admit. But she's 16, and the move was certainly hard on her. But yelling at her is not appropriate. And you hold a lot more resentment towards her than is fair. Your financial situation isn't anyone's fault, but she was a kid. It shouldn't have been on her to put in the effort.\n\nParent-child relationships are generally one-sided in terms of effort until the kid is solidly into adulthood. She didn't put in tonnes of effort, and she shouldn't have been expected to.\n\nI'm not sure there's a good solution. Your current living arrangement didn't work for her, understandably so. Sharing a room is frustrating, and I'd imagine that her sister's tourette's turned that up to 11.", "YTA your comment said you admitted to not being dad of the year, you were barely a dad! Who makes a 9 year old choose where they should live, they\u2019re a kid! That shouldn\u2019t be on them! And now you\u2019re holding it against her and throwing it in her face.

And you and wifey are supreme AHs for being happy she's leaving.\n\n 6 years is gonna seem like nothing after tomorrow. Take a good look at the kid you've abandoned because she's gone for good.", "I'm sorry. I know this is rough and you don't have all the tools and resources you need. Unfortunately because of that, you have damaged your relationship with her. Her behavior may have warranted correction, but it absolutely did not warrant you accusing her of \"fucking off\" for 6 years. This isn't another adult failing to compromise or meet you halfway, this is *your child*. ~CHILD~. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that you know there's more to the story even if you don't know what it is. Like I said, a 16-year-old isn't going to choose to go from a financially privileged existence to sharing a bedroom with her little sister on a full-time basis without cause. She's not going to flee from her familiar social circle without cause. She's not going to go from, \"I can't be bothered to come visit,\" to \"Can I live with you instead,\" without cause.\n\nYou might not know that cause, but surely there's enough here to know that she's obviously struggling with something. It may not be your fault that your relationship is where it is, but it is absolutely your responsibility.\n\nYTA.", "Yta there are trains, buses and cars. There are so many ways to get from A to B that I don't even think about. But OP blames the child for his own inability to search for options.

What\u2019s going on at her mother\u2019s house? Is she safe there? Has something happened at school?", "YTA.  Specifically for exploding at her and casting blame. Your house isn't big enough for your family. You can't afford anything more. That's fair. Your daughter was making some big adjustments. Moving in with a family she no longer really knows, going from having 2 spaces for her personal use to sharing a room, being away from her mom, changing schools, leaving behind her friends.  Obviously it was an adjustment for the rest of the family too, but you are the parent and adult. You could and should have worked harder to find solutions for your younger daughter. Ear plugs for the noise at night. Some private time in the bedroom every day for each girl.  Or every other day. Maybe a curtain down the center of the room for privacy. Or failing that, each have a corner of the room that was their personal space. Explaining clearly why it wasn't a good idea for your son to share his space. Your daughter's behavior did cross the line, but there were other ways of dealing with that too. Have her do a research paper on autism. Make up a cleaning schedule and assign chores to all the kids as appropriate. Have daughter participate in meal planning and budgeting groceries and let her choose one meal a week working within any dietary restrictions and budget which she can help cook. The other kids could have participated in that too. It's too late now obviously, but she needed to be included in the family unit and to learn and understand the financial and space constraints you are working with and to also understand that her needs while important, do not take priority over everyone else in the family's needs so needs must be prioritized.", "ESH\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure what she expected but it sucks.", "You're a parent who snapped.

You're struggling financially and you have a lot to deal with... no judgement, so many of us are in similar positions these days. Your daughter seems to be the last straw. \n\nSo how you move forward is the bigger issue. A big apology is necessary and don't put any buts into it. She's a kid still, and as much as she wants to be thought of as an adult, her brain is not fully there yet. I can't help with the ins and outs but communication directly with her is necessary.

What was your excuse then?", "Ok, but you knew things going south was a possibility. You knew you already had two children to support, and were separated from the other parent, so one party having to move away was always something that might have happened.

I've no doubt it can be hard to pin down exactly what you got wrong or what you should have done differently, but, whatever it was, it was you or the person you chose to have two children with.\n\nI'm going to take a wild stab in the dark here. You mentioned your eldest has Tourette's. You also mentioned your youngest has autism. All I will suggest is that there are posts on AITA almost every day from someone who was neurotypical/healthy and ended up sidelined for much of their childhood because their non-typical sibling required a lot of attention from their parents. And in your daughter's case, she had *two* siblings who might have needed extra treatment. How possible do you think it is this was the case with your daughter?\n\nI say this because it wasn't just you that she moved away from, it was also her other two siblings. The younger child from a new partner, sure, there are often struggles bonding there. But to choose to live apart from her full sister who's only a year apart from her in age? That happens, but it's unusual. Unusual enough for me to raise an eyebrow and consider some possibilities.\n\nBut they're just wild assumptions. So now I'm asking you: how accurate are they?", "So the circumstances beyond your control are no ones fault but the circumstances in *your* control are hers? She didn't fuck off for six years as you describe it. Rather than make decisions as adults responsible for doing so, your ex and you *palmed that decision off on to children* and now you're using that against her in an argument? Was it her fault you had no money? From the way you describe it, she chose to live with her mother thinking you'd be coming to see her. Is it her fault you couldn't? No? Then *how are you holding that against her*? \n\nKids are ego centric. It's literally part of their development. She didn't, as a child, understand your financial situation and all it's ins and outs. Nor should she be expected to. All she saw was you not showing up like she thought you would. She's complaining because - newsflash - that's what teenagers *do*. It's not about the room. Teenagers kicking off about stuff is never about the actual thing. It's about having responsibilities but no control. Or abandonment issues, which - depsite your best efforts - you and you ex have given her (and then hold against her, when you caused it, inadvertent or not).

Life fucking sucks sometimes and we have to make tough decisions where someone has to lose. It's not fair, but that's life. You can fuck off if you think OP made the wrong decision when he chose to feed his two kids instead of buying a plane ticket and hotel room to visit a kid who had their own room to sleep in and didn't have to worry about dinner every night. No, he shouldn't have yelled at her, but he's been stressing about keeping his family afloat for years.", "Why are you placing that all on him?
