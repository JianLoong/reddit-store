I work from home and have a car, he works in an office and has a car that doesn't run, so he uses mine. He's also a musician and has rehearsal/gigs 3-5 days a week, meaning I don't have access to my car from 7AM-9PM+ at least half the week. Not a huge deal since I WFH, but we both live pretty much paycheck to paycheck and he has a lot more debt than me, so I pay the full insurance for both of us ($450 a month). \n\nEssentially, I'm paying that much every month to not be able to use my car, on top of paying for ubers whenever I want to do something outside the house. Throughout this time, he's told me that as soon as he catches up on his debt he'll start splitting the insurance cost with me if he hasn't gotten his car fixed before then. He's been slowly fixing his and has just under $1,000 of repairs left. \n\nHe recently sold some music gear for close to $1,000 with the intent to use that money to buy this rare/special guitar that he says will be a gamechanger for the album he's working on. I'm not super well-versed in music equipment, but he explained how it gets a different tone than standard guitars and it does seem important for what he's doing.\n\nThe other morning I got frustrated with him about a myriad of things (chores, money, not having my car) and told him that if he spends the gear money on the new guitar instead of fixing his car, I won't pay for him to be insured on mine anymore and that I won't be responsible for driving him around every day. He seems to understand where I'm coming from but is frustrated with me and his family thinks I'm being selfish by forcing him to make a big sacrifice for my benefit.\n\nNow I'm worried that I'm being unfair. I could remove him from my policy and drive him to and from work/gigs/rehearsals, but getting him to and from work alone takes 1.5-2 hours out of my day. I'm a very anxious person with bad ADHD, so having that responsibility hanging over my head every day is really stressful and makes it hard for me to focus.\n\nAm I the asshole for forcing him to make the choice between this guitar or access to my car when he could have both if I sucked it up and drove him around?", "created_utc": 1687283135, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ehs4v/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_if_he_buys_a/", "score": 745, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Giving up spending his money freely to cover his own responsibilities instead of continuing to mooch off of you? NTA. Take back your car.", "NTA\n\nWhat would he be doing if you weren't around? I'm baffled by his family... let them give him the money to fix his car then! You are NOT his parent!!!", "Guitar player here: Don\u2019t fall for his bullshit. No guitar is a \u201cgame changer\u201d. Skill, talent and technique, yes; gear, not really. Your BF wants a new guitar like a toddler wants a new toy. He doesn\u2019t want to spend money on fixing his car because he can use your resources instead. NTA and don\u2019t give up an inch. You\u2019ve already enabled him enough.", "NTA.  If anyone should be paying for Ubers, use public transit, or get a bicycle it is your bf.  Getting him to and from work is not your job.  $450 a month on insurance?!  Someone has a really bad driving record.  His family should not be involved in your conflicts. That is a red flag if he is running to them to complain.  If they  say anything to you, you should ask them why they have not given him the money to fix his own car since they feel it is their business to expect you to do so when you are not married.  Another red flag is that he will sell things to buy new toys, but he does not sacrifice to pay off debts (that includes debts to you).  A responsible person does it the other way around.", "NTA\n\nYour BF is learning a very important life lesson.  He can wait for the guitar because it isn't important, transportation is.  He needs to finish fixing his car and get his own insurance.  THEN he can save up for this \"game changing\" (scoff) guitar.\n\nI get it, music is important to him.  But, he isn't going to hit it big just because he bought a $1000 guitar.  Far from it.  The chances of him making it big as a musician are billions-to-one.  In the meantime, he needs transport and he should have been paying you back for the insurance this whole time (especially as he has been using your vehicle (read creating wear on your asset) without any compensation for you).", "NTA. Removing him from your insurance is one thing, but it doesn't mean then you are then responsible for his transportation. Right now, there's no downside for him. He's not going to miss out on anything. If he missed a gig because he didn't fix his car, his priorities might change.", "NTA. He has *debt*, a *broken car*, and doesn't pay anything towards what is needed to keep your car on the road. He should be selling equipment to pay off his debt, or fix his car, or sell that piece of junk and using that money for a down payment on a new car. It doesn't matter that you work from home and don't use it much, you pay fully to have it insured and use it whenever you want for whatever you want, not so he can go to work. \n\nWhat would he do if you made the completely justified decision to sell your car? It seems like it's costing you an awful lot and you get very little in return for it, he isn't contributing to it in any way, he'd have to sell all his shit to figure out how to get to his job. His hobbies do not trump his responsibilities nor your wants and needs. The simple fact is that he bought a new toy when you're struggling to keep the car he uses on the road.", "NTA\n\nHe's using you and he learned it from his family.\n\nActually, it's the perfect opportunity for his family to prove how selfless they are and loan him their car or pay for his repairs to get him back on the road.", "I'm sorry, HE would be making a sacrifice for your sake?

Especially if he continues to make poor financial choices.", "Tell his family to pay the insurance and car repairs.... If they agree the guitar is a great investment. \n\nReally, the only guaranteed return on your investment is his car.... Since you won't have to pay for a Uber or insurance.\n\nNTA you don't have to rationalize why you don't want to do this. No is a complete sentence.

He is massively taking advantage of you.", "Nta. He needs priorities which should be sorting his car given he's the one who needs it.", "NTA. \n\nYou're not selfish for asking him to make a sacrifice for your benefit, considering you sacrifice your time, money and reliable transportation for him. \n\nYou aren't obligated to cover the cost of his insurance or let him use your car. \n\nHis family can pay for his repairs if they want to call you selfish over that. Wow. He is not your responsibility.", "Nope, NTA.  kinda simple.  this is not going to be an easy run.", "Hey just FYI, if he lives with you, he needs to be listed on your auto insurance. I am an insurance claims adjuster, specically working in auto insurance claims. If he takes your car and wrecks it and he's not listed on your policy, there is a good chance that your insurance company would deny the claim and you're on the hook for the damage to your car and possibly any damage that he caused.  It does vary by state and country but I would strong advise against removing him if you live in the US.  \n\nAlso, NTA, he needs to grow up.", "NTA. Sounds like you are carrying all of the weight in the relationship and sound far from selfish. His priorities are out of order", "NTA\n\nIgnore his family. The whole reason you are the bad guy for them is that they don't want to have the problems you are having with him back in their home to have to manage. Making you feel bad keeps you stuck in the rut. \n\nIf he wants that guitar then he needs to take on a short term extra job for that money. Take on a side hustle that doesn't involve your car. Like dog walking (just an example).  Just something short term to fill the gap so he can get the guitar. Him funding his hobby shouldn't impact your work/life on such a tight budget.", "How many guitars is too many? Trick question - no such thing! /s\n\nNTA\n\nThe thought that the tonal differences between two guitars is the difference that will make the album the NEXT BIG THING is ... delusional. I mean, if you're not getting exactly what you want, borrow one from a friend. There are truly only so many wood/neck/config/string/electronics combinations out there.", "Not letting him take advantage of you is being selfish. He didn't fall far from the tree. Making his parents pressure you is such a red flag.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He can fix his car so he (and you) can get around and then save up for the guitar.", "NTA\n\nHe's using your car, yet you pay for UBER to get around? He wants to buy a guitar vs fixing his car? \n\nHe's taking advantage of you, and this can be considered financial abuse. \n\nOf course his family thinks you're being the AH, family can be bias, they may have similar perspectives or don't want to have to be the alternative if you stop helping him.", "NTA- he could easily buy the guitar AFTER he fixes his own car. What he's doing now is selfish and just feels like he's using you", "NtA tell him to take the bus with his guitare. And if he buy it instead of paying you back, kick his as out. Don't force him to pay to repare HIS car, he will still be the only one benefiting for it. You may love him, but he is using you. You will end up broke, both with your heart and your bank account.", "Nta. He needs to do a little maturing and realize what is and is not a priority. His band is his gig, not his job it sounds like.  So he needs to prioritize the thing that gets him to his job.", "NTA, but your bf sure as hell is TA for even considering buying a guitar before helping you w/ the car! How selfish can a person be? And for him to get his family to get after you is a HUGE red flag, talk about running crying to mommy!\n\nIf his family thinks it soo selfish if you to do that, then tell them THEY can lend/buy him a car, see how quickly they change their tune lol.\n\nYou're completely in the right and I hope you do remove him off your coverage until he starts paying for it. He's been freeloading for long enough.", "So if you dump him you would have a car, less bills to pay and less stress. This sounds good to me. What about you?", "So you think that you might be unreasonable for not subsidising his hobby and more generally, his life? Because that's what you're doing, paying for a car that you don't get to use (and probably also a large percentage of your joint monthly outcomings) so that he can spend his money on himself. For that alone, YTA, but as regards the car, no, definitely do not keep him on the insurance, don't let him use your car anymore and maybe have some therapy to find out why you let him take advantage of you (leaving him wouldn't be a bad idea either, while you're at it).", "NTA... butt....\n\nseriously, he's an adult and needs to be responsible for his own transportation. if you want to stop paying for his insurance then stop. if you want to stop lending him your car then stop. if you want to sell your car, cancel everything, and just take ubers when you go out then do so.\n\nbut wording it as a \"do things my way or I take stuff away\" is kinda over the top.", "ESH.\n\nyou suck for allowing this man to be on your policy for free when he\u2019s the only one (or at least most of the time) who uses it. don\u2019t do that to yourself, especially if you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck. relationships are about compromise but you should\u2019ve have to be making yourself uncomfortable to suit his needs.\n\nhe sucks for not having a good grip on his finances and taking advantage of your kindness. he\u2019s not going to pay off his debts. there will always be something else he wants to spend money on, I guarantee it.", "INFO:  car insurance is usually by household, I doubt that you will be able to remove him.

The issue isn't really with him, I'm sure he'll put the money into the car now that I've brought it up and it'll be a learning lesson. But his family regularly makes me question my sanity when I set what I think are fair expectations, especially financial ones, which is what happened here. I try to be very aware that I essentially had a head start in life compared to him and that it's not entirely his fault he's broke and has poor money management as that's how he was raised, but it is his responsibility to handle it like an adult. \n\nI think in his family's eyes it's an unfair sacrifice because I could just take him off the policy and agree to drive him everywhere (lol). They've complained about it in the past -- they live two hours away and if he can't make some family event because I need my car for meetings that day, they start the whole \"she's being selfish by not prioritizing the time to get you here when she knows you can't afford to rent a car/we don't have a car to come get you with\" rant.", "His family baffles me quite a bit as well. They grew up on the poverty line while I grew up upper-middle class, and I think his parents (mostly mother) resent me because of that. His parents aren't able to help him financially and mine are able to help me, though I try to avoid that as much as I can and always pay them back even if they don't ask me to.\n\nI think in her eyes, I'm being selfish because both of the options I laid out require him to spend a lot of money and she thinks that because my family has money, it's selfish of me to not lay down mine wherever I can to help him. More likely, it's that if he wasn't dating me she'd have more reason to try and convince him to move home so that he can save money -- because naturally, dating me is why he's broke. /sarcasm", "The high insurance cost is a combination of me totaling my car and having the car I purchased with the claim money stolen within a year of each other -- he has a perfect driving record, sigh. Plus, we live in one of the most expensive cities for car insurance nationwide (bonus points if you can guess where!). With just me on the policy, it would be $280.\n\nThe family is a whole thing - very overbearing but he does a good job setting boundaries. He only mentioned this situation to them because they asked when he was getting the guitar.

My guitar skills are ok, but my father in law was a professional session guitarist for thirty years and if I played a song on a $10,000 custom guitar while he played the same tune on a 200 dollar squier, he\u2019d STILL sound WAYYY better on the cheapo fender knockoff.\n\nWhy? Because he\u2019s been playing with more dedication, and for WAY longer than me and his skills make me look like an absolute novice. \n\nYour BF is looking for answers by asking the wrong questions. Speaking as a man who comes from a family of musicians, I\u2019ve seen this \u201cneed new gear to make me sound better\u201d syndrome and it\u2019s 100% BS. But musicians can be really passionate and obsessive about stuff like this, especially when they don\u2019t give their chops the honest self reflection they need. He needs to come back down to the real world and handle his s@@@ first before investing in an expensive instrument that won\u2019t make him a better guitar player.", "NTA, he can use a tone emulator pedal or one in his DAW (digital audio workshop) to get the tone he wants.", "With regard to that \"rare tone\" guitar...he might hear the difference, and maybe some other guitar players will hear it as well, but the idea that this is necessary for his album is just nonsense.    \nThe \"rare tone\" guitar is just a new pet.", "YTA. My man is on the cusp of greatness and you\u2019re trying to hold him back. Probably because you\u2019re jealous of his toan. Can you even 0-3-5?", "NTA. You are paying him to use your own car. At the very least, he should be reimbursing you for ubers if you need to go somewhere. Better yet, he should have offered to drive you wherever you want.", "Why is his family even involved in this conversation. Did he run to tell them ?\n\nTell them to butt out unless they are paying your bills. He's not sacrificing anything. He can fix his car first as that is needed to work to make money.\n\nI'd be more concerned of why he is telling his family in the first place and why he allows them to speak about you that way.", "So he is supposed to pay an exorbitant amount for insurance because of your bad insurance policy? Just cancel him and have him get his own policy. It could be cheaper.", "Is your boyfriend a fan of Japanese rock? The guitar itself is unusual, being a baritone with 3 different types of pickups, but I **highly** doubt it is the \"game changer\" your boyfriend is calling it.", "You don\u2019t need to be playing for the foo fighters to have a successful career in the music industry. I run a mixing/mastering studio and I do pretty well. And my FIL was a professional session guitarist for 30 years. He\u2019d make $200 bucks per hour doing studio tracking as his regular income. \n\nI agree with your overall comment for sure, but you don\u2019t need to be a superstar to make money in music. You just need to work really hard and find a way to monetize your skills into a specialized supply to a specific demand.", "Hahaha EXCUSE ME SIR\u2026.\nBut Gearslutz would STRONGLY disagree! \ud83d\ude02", "Lmao yeah anyone who thinks \u201cthis new $10,000 guitar will really TURN THINGS AROUND and make my ep SLAP is going down a very slippery slope. From what I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s kind of an addiction for some people honestly. \n\nAs a pro mixing/mastering engineer, my number one recommendation to ANYONE asking me which plug-ins they NEED to make good music, is that if you can\u2019t make GREAT sounding mixes/masters with stock plug-ins, you shouldn\u2019t even be BUYING all those expensive third party plug-ins. Of course only about 10% of the people I say this to actually listen. \n\nSigh\u2026", "\ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \n\nThe only way to GIT GUD is PRACTICE. Pure and simple, your tools are secondary. My FIL was a professional session guitarist for over 30 years and if I played a song with my $5,000 strat while he played the SAME song on a $200 fender knockoff, he\u2019d STILL sound way WAYYY better. Because he has 40 years of experience learning/playing/practicing guitar and I only have 12 years under my belt. \n\nThe clothes really do not make the man. Like, at all.", "Also if he really does want a specific guitar to record the album, why does he need to buy one outright? Why can't he just find one to borrow or rent? All my albums are recorded with nicer instruments than I own/tour with...", "Oh, someone is getting played alright.", "No offense, why are you with this guy if he can't be responsible with his money and prioritize his expenses in the order in which they need to be paid? \nAs for the guitar in question, can he not rent it from a music store for the time being? Ask a family member (or members) for $ to go towards the guitar? Make it an early Birthday/Christmas gift?\nIt's not fair in any way, shape, or form to not have access to your own damn car. He's putting the wear and tear on it, and if his car maintainance is any indication, he's not getting things fixed right away. The reason why car repairs get so expensive is because problems didn't get addressed as soon as they come up.\n\n\u25cfHis band mates should start driving him around to gigs\u25cf\n\nYou're NTA. I hope you're able to come to a solution that works for you. Take care.", "Or the dedication and drive to practice and work really hard to get good at your craft.", "Boundaries and lack of tools can really spur creativity.  From a perspective of writing, I used to hate teachers giving ideas to include in a story.  But as I got further, I enjoyed finding ways to twist those ideas in a not so obvious way.  I imagine it's the same for music or art.  Not having the best obvious option, you find a way to make your idea work with what you have on hand.", "I see what you\u2019re saying, but getting a full setup at your local repair shop (and modding out some features on your cheap guitar) can make a cheapo guitar feel (and sound) really good. I do get what you mean about playability but you can mod the fretboard (and almost everything else) on a cheap guitar like a Gretsch streamliner jet. That\u2019s what I did, and all I can say is that it\u2019s just as fun (and easy) to play as my fender American professional strat & my fender American performer telly. And it sounds frickin phenomenal considering that even with the mods, it cost a fraction of almost all my other guitars.", "Snowy underwear gnomes", "[removed]", "NTA you're dating him, not caring for him, he needs to grow the fuck up and sort his car cause if you break up how fucked will he be?", "DTMFA", ">on top of paying for ubers whenever I want to do something outside the house. \n\nI'm sorry why are YOU the one paying for Uber instead of using your own car?? Last time I checked it's your car and you're paying for everything. He should be the one getting Uber whenever you want to use your own freaking car. NTA", "YTA. That guitar could mean the difference between a mediocre album and music history! The difference in sound quality between cheap and expensive guitars is incredibly noticeable and profound. Jimmy henderix would never have been able to record purple rain without his vintage fender!\n\nI dont blame you for not understanding the importance of a quality instrument to a musician but trust me, the guitar will be a great investment. \n\nAbout the car, mabie consider saving up together and buying him a van so its easier to haul his equipment to gigs! Then the guitar will pay for itself quicker.", "NTA", "\"his family thinks I'm being selfish by forcing him to make a big sacrifice for my benefit.\"\n\nNo, no. This is all backwards: HE is being selfish by forcing YOU to make a sacrifice for HIS benefit. He can use his gear money for the album only because he relies on you to pay/do other things he needs sorted. If he were a good partner he would realize he cannot put you under so much stress to meet his goals.", "NTA. If his family thinks it's such a great investment, they can help him find $1000.", "Sorry to sound harsh, but soft YTA for putting up with this.

He never had money for child support (not my kid), but cashed out his 401K to buy a drum kit.\nI hang with lots of musicians and not a single one has ever blown money on a guitar for a \"sound\". Between pedals and digital plugins for recording, you can get any sound out of any guitar these days.\n\nYour boyfriend will not change. He will not get better at finances. He will mooch off you and ruin your credit and financial stability. I'm telling you from experience. Do not have a baby with him and leave while you still have a car and some cash.\nOr accept that you will be covering his ass forever.", "NTA. How on earth are you selfish, for wanting to use YOUR car, that you pay for, that your bf doesn\u2019t contribute anything to (I hope he pays for gas!)

Is it supposed to be a benefit to pay his way while he takes advantage of you?!?!?\n Omg, we insure 4 vehicles & our home for less than half of that! At 25, your rates should have came down some. By the time you get your car back, it will be broken & in need of repairs. Hes grown, he can take a bus if he cant afford it (watch how fast he gets it fixed then)", "NTA, I think this is about more than the guitar it\u2019s just your breaking point. I get he wants to buy something to improve his passion but we all have responsibilities.  To me reading this and I see someone who is taking on the mothering of a person that isn\u2019t a child, both financially & mentally and that\u2019s draining. Relationships and living together is give and take and he\u2019s taking more than he\u2019s giving. Even if he put something towards insurance/ paid for all ubers etc or could have sold his car to put a lump sum aside for it. I hope you get this sorted.", "NTA at all - he needs to start sorting his own business out instead of mooching off of you.\n\nAlso, I hate this whole 'his family think' - why do these people always go and tell their family when they dont get their own way in a relationship?", "There is no way a guitar can be a game-changer unless the change is from no guitars to one guitar.
