I work from home and have a car, he works in an office and has a car that doesn't run, so he uses mine. He's also a musician and has rehearsal/gigs 3-5 days a week, meaning I don't have access to my car from 7AM-9PM+ at least half the week. Not a huge deal since I WFH, but we both live pretty much paycheck to paycheck and he has a lot more debt than me, so I pay the full insurance for both of us ($450 a month). \n\nEssentially, I'm paying that much every month to not be able to use my car, on top of paying for ubers whenever I want to do something outside the house. Throughout this time, he's told me that as soon as he catches up on his debt he'll start splitting the insurance cost with me if he hasn't gotten his car fixed before then. He's been slowly fixing his and has just under $1,000 of repairs left. \n\nHe recently sold some music gear for close to $1,000 with the intent to use that money to buy this rare/special guitar that he says will be a gamechanger for the album he's working on. I'm not super well-versed in music equipment, but he explained how it gets a different tone than standard guitars and it does seem important for what he's doing.\n\nThe other morning I got frustrated with him about a myriad of things (chores, money, not having my car) and told him that if he spends the gear money on the new guitar instead of fixing his car, I won't pay for him to be insured on mine anymore and that I won't be responsible for driving him around every day. He seems to understand where I'm coming from but is frustrated with me and his family thinks I'm being selfish by forcing him to make a big sacrifice for my benefit.\n\nNow I'm worried that I'm being unfair. I could remove him from my policy and drive him to and from work/gigs/rehearsals, but getting him to and from work alone takes 1.5-2 hours out of my day. I'm a very anxious person with bad ADHD, so having that responsibility hanging over my head every day is really stressful and makes it hard for me to focus.\n\nAm I the asshole for forcing him to make the choice between this guitar or access to my car when he could have both if I sucked it up and drove him around?", "created_utc": 1687283135, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ehs4v/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_if_he_buys_a/", "score": 433, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Giving up spending his money freely to cover his own responsibilities instead of continuing to mooch off of you? NTA. Take back your car.", "NTA\n\nWhat would he be doing if you weren't around? I'm baffled by his family... let them give him the money to fix his car then! You are NOT his parent!!!", "Guitar player here: Don\u2019t fall for his bullshit. No guitar is a \u201cgame changer\u201d. Skill, talent and technique, yes; gear, not really. Your BF wants a new guitar like a toddler wants a new toy. He doesn\u2019t want to spend money on fixing his car because he can use your resources instead. NTA and don\u2019t give up an inch. You\u2019ve already enabled him enough.", "NTA.  If anyone should be paying for Ubers, use public transit, or get a bicycle it is your bf.  Getting him to and from work is not your job.  $450 a month on insurance?!  Someone has a really bad driving record.  His family should not be involved in your conflicts. That is a red flag if he is running to them to complain.  If they  say anything to you, you should ask them why they have not given him the money to fix his own car since they feel it is their business to expect you to do so when you are not married.  Another red flag is that he will sell things to buy new toys, but he does not sacrifice to pay off debts (that includes debts to you).  A responsible person does it the other way around.", "NTA\n\nYour BF is learning a very important life lesson.  He can wait for the guitar because it isn't important, transportation is.  He needs to finish fixing his car and get his own insurance.  THEN he can save up for this \"game changing\" (scoff) guitar.\n\nI get it, music is important to him.  But, he isn't going to hit it big just because he bought a $1000 guitar.  Far from it.  The chances of him making it big as a musician are billions-to-one.  In the meantime, he needs transport and he should have been paying you back for the insurance this whole time (especially as he has been using your vehicle (read creating wear on your asset) without any compensation for you).", "NTA. Removing him from your insurance is one thing, but it doesn't mean then you are then responsible for his transportation. Right now, there's no downside for him. He's not going to miss out on anything. If he missed a gig because he didn't fix his car, his priorities might change.", "NTA. He has *debt*, a *broken car*, and doesn't pay anything towards what is needed to keep your car on the road. He should be selling equipment to pay off his debt, or fix his car, or sell that piece of junk and using that money for a down payment on a new car. It doesn't matter that you work from home and don't use it much, you pay fully to have it insured and use it whenever you want for whatever you want, not so he can go to work. \n\nWhat would he do if you made the completely justified decision to sell your car? It seems like it's costing you an awful lot and you get very little in return for it, he isn't contributing to it in any way, he'd have to sell all his shit to figure out how to get to his job. His hobbies do not trump his responsibilities nor your wants and needs. The simple fact is that he bought a new toy when you're struggling to keep the car he uses on the road.", "NTA\n\nHe's using you and he learned it from his family.\n\nActually, it's the perfect opportunity for his family to prove how selfless they are and loan him their car or pay for his repairs to get him back on the road.", "I'm sorry, HE would be making a sacrifice for your sake?

Especially if he continues to make poor financial choices.", "Tell his family to pay the insurance and car repairs.... If they agree the guitar is a great investment. \n\nReally, the only guaranteed return on your investment is his car.... Since you won't have to pay for a Uber or insurance.\n\nNTA you don't have to rationalize why you don't want to do this. No is a complete sentence.

He is massively taking advantage of you.", "Nta. He needs priorities which should be sorting his car given he's the one who needs it.", "NTA. \n\nYou're not selfish for asking him to make a sacrifice for your benefit, considering you sacrifice your time, money and reliable transportation for him. \n\nYou aren't obligated to cover the cost of his insurance or let him use your car. \n\nHis family can pay for his repairs if they want to call you selfish over that. Wow. He is not your responsibility.", "Nope, NTA.  kinda simple.  this is not going to be an easy run.", "Hey just FYI, if he lives with you, he needs to be listed on your auto insurance. I am an insurance claims adjuster, specically working in auto insurance claims. If he takes your car and wrecks it and he's not listed on your policy, there is a good chance that your insurance company would deny the claim and you're on the hook for the damage to your car and possibly any damage that he caused.  It does vary by state and country but I would strong advise against removing him if you live in the US.  \n\nAlso, NTA, he needs to grow up.", "NTA. Sounds like you are carrying all of the weight in the relationship and sound far from selfish. His priorities are out of order", "NTA\n\nIgnore his family. The whole reason you are the bad guy for them is that they don't want to have the problems you are having with him back in their home to have to manage. Making you feel bad keeps you stuck in the rut. \n\nIf he wants that guitar then he needs to take on a short term extra job for that money. Take on a side hustle that doesn't involve your car. Like dog walking (just an example).  Just something short term to fill the gap so he can get the guitar. Him funding his hobby shouldn't impact your work/life on such a tight budget.", "How many guitars is too many? Trick question - no such thing! /s\n\nNTA\n\nThe thought that the tonal differences between two guitars is the difference that will make the album the NEXT BIG THING is ... delusional. I mean, if you're not getting exactly what you want, borrow one from a friend. There are truly only so many wood/neck/config/string/electronics combinations out there.", "Not letting him take advantage of you is being selfish. He didn't fall far from the tree. Making his parents pressure you is such a red flag.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He can fix his car so he (and you) can get around and then save up for the guitar.", "NTA\n\nHe's using your car, yet you pay for UBER to get around? He wants to buy a guitar vs fixing his car? \n\nHe's taking advantage of you, and this can be considered financial abuse. \n\nOf course his family thinks you're being the AH, family can be bias, they may have similar perspectives or don't want to have to be the alternative if you stop helping him.", "NTA- he could easily buy the guitar AFTER he fixes his own car. What he's doing now is selfish and just feels like he's using you", "NtA tell him to take the bus with his guitare. And if he buy it instead of paying you back, kick his as out. Don't force him to pay to repare HIS car, he will still be the only one benefiting for it. You may love him, but he is using you. You will end up broke, both with your heart and your bank account.", "Nta. He needs to do a little maturing and realize what is and is not a priority. His band is his gig, not his job it sounds like.  So he needs to prioritize the thing that gets him to his job.", "NTA, but your bf sure as hell is TA for even considering buying a guitar before helping you w/ the car! How selfish can a person be? And for him to get his family to get after you is a HUGE red flag, talk about running crying to mommy!\n\nIf his family thinks it soo selfish if you to do that, then tell them THEY can lend/buy him a car, see how quickly they change their tune lol.\n\nYou're completely in the right and I hope you do remove him off your coverage until he starts paying for it. He's been freeloading for long enough.", "So if you dump him you would have a car, less bills to pay and less stress. This sounds good to me. What about you?", "So you think that you might be unreasonable for not subsidising his hobby and more generally, his life? Because that's what you're doing, paying for a car that you don't get to use (and probably also a large percentage of your joint monthly outcomings) so that he can spend his money on himself. For that alone, YTA, but as regards the car, no, definitely do not keep him on the insurance, don't let him use your car anymore and maybe have some therapy to find out why you let him take advantage of you (leaving him wouldn't be a bad idea either, while you're at it).", "NTA... butt....\n\nseriously, he's an adult and needs to be responsible for his own transportation. if you want to stop paying for his insurance then stop. if you want to stop lending him your car then stop. if you want to sell your car, cancel everything, and just take ubers when you go out then do so.\n\nbut wording it as a \"do things my way or I take stuff away\" is kinda over the top.", "ESH.\n\nyou suck for allowing this man to be on your policy for free when he\u2019s the only one (or at least most of the time) who uses it. don\u2019t do that to yourself, especially if you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck. relationships are about compromise but you should\u2019ve have to be making yourself uncomfortable to suit his needs.\n\nhe sucks for not having a good grip on his finances and taking advantage of your kindness. he\u2019s not going to pay off his debts. there will always be something else he wants to spend money on, I guarantee it.", "INFO:  car insurance is usually by household, I doubt that you will be able to remove him.

The issue isn't really with him, I'm sure he'll put the money into the car now that I've brought it up and it'll be a learning lesson. But his family regularly makes me question my sanity when I set what I think are fair expectations, especially financial ones, which is what happened here. I try to be very aware that I essentially had a head start in life compared to him and that it's not entirely his fault he's broke and has poor money management as that's how he was raised, but it is his responsibility to handle it like an adult. \n\nI think in his family's eyes it's an unfair sacrifice because I could just take him off the policy and agree to drive him everywhere (lol). They've complained about it in the past -- they live two hours away and if he can't make some family event because I need my car for meetings that day, they start the whole \"she's being selfish by not prioritizing the time to get you here when she knows you can't afford to rent a car/we don't have a car to come get you with\" rant.", "His family baffles me quite a bit as well. They grew up on the poverty line while I grew up upper-middle class, and I think his parents (mostly mother) resent me because of that. His parents aren't able to help him financially and mine are able to help me, though I try to avoid that as much as I can and always pay them back even if they don't ask me to.\n\nI think in her eyes, I'm being selfish because both of the options I laid out require him to spend a lot of money and she thinks that because my family has money, it's selfish of me to not lay down mine wherever I can to help him. More likely, it's that if he wasn't dating me she'd have more reason to try and convince him to move home so that he can save money -- because naturally, dating me is why he's broke. /sarcasm", "The high insurance cost is a combination of me totaling my car and having the car I purchased with the claim money stolen within a year of each other -- he has a perfect driving record, sigh. Plus, we live in one of the most expensive cities for car insurance nationwide (bonus points if you can guess where!). With just me on the policy, it would be $280.\n\nThe family is a whole thing - very overbearing but he does a good job setting boundaries. He only mentioned this situation to them because they asked when he was getting the guitar.

In which his claim may be valid if he is looking for a specific tone. Not that I'd consider a guitar in the $1000 range special or rare, but their tone can still vary greatly.\n\nAlso NTA.", "Correct at these two above comments! He plays in two bands, one of which is the go-to band in our city for their genre and is slowly growing around the region. \n\nThe guitar is a game changer specifically to the album -- he doesn't think that getting this guitar is going to skyrocket him to fame or anything, he'll just be able to get a specific tone that has been a hold up in moving to recording. The guitar in question would be bought used, as far as I understand it's pretty rare so it's not quite as easy as \"just buy it later\" -- this is the first one he's seen on the market in a couple years. \n\nNot justifying him buying the guitar instead of fixing the car ofc, I want the goddamn car fixed, just adding a little more context.", "And you can get that for a grand?!", "I'm a good skier but 5 grand equipment won't have me doing back flips tomorrow", "Well it sounds like he\u2019s actually seeing some success in the band, which is great! It makes it much better than someone who\u2019s not paying the bills strictly for a hobby. \n\nUnfortunately, sometimes shit hits the fan and we can\u2019t get everything that we want.

Eddie Van Halen recorded on a guitar he made himself from discounted parts for $250. \n\nMike Rutherford (Genesis) used modified Squire Stratocasters on his last tour.\n\nIt's 99% skill.

After we broke up it took me a long while to get back on my feet. He immediately found another woman to live with for free. When they broke up she took him to small claims court for the money he talked her into \u201cinvesting\u201d in his new album. Then he moved in with another woman with money. They\u2019ve since divorced, and one of the next women he dated is again suing him for her money back. \n\nYou are not his investor or his mom, you\u2019re meant to be partners.

You need to include everyone in the household on the policy or sign an exclusion. And it's gonna be less headaches to just leave him on when eventually drives the car anyways and gets in an accident. \n\nAlso maybe evaluate the relationship? You shouldn't be having to play parent to a 25 year old man mooching off of you.", "Guitar player here: nope. I've seen amazing guitarists playing stuff that will blow your mind on cheap kiddie instruments, and amateur guitarists sound like the amateurs they are playing guitars that cost more than I make in 6 months. While there is absolutely a difference in tone between guitars, it's not going to make or break his album. No one except for him and maybe his bandmateswill notice, and rare is the person who can listen to an album and ID what guitar someone is playing by sound alone (maybe single vs humbucker pups, but that's about it). Responsibilities trump instruments, as someone who has several guitars. If it came down to a new axe and using that money to make mine and my partner's life easier/more convenient/more financially secure, I know I'd be just fine with the instruments I already have until we can all afford for me to splurge on my dream guitar.\n\nOP, you are NTA", "NTA Sounds like your bf has gotten very comfortable with using your car.

Living paycheck to paycheck means sacrificing and scrimping to save to have a better future and financial stability!! Sacrifice now and it will pay off in the future!! He needs to pay down his debt and start putting money away in a savings acct. what happens if/when your car shits the bed or needs expensive work done to it, will he be able to afford the upkeep?? \n\nDo not feel guilty!!

Most guitars in that price range especially for that type of guitar tend to have construction issues that prevent ever getting the action low enough.  Nuts are notoriously cut bad, pretty damn rare to actually get completely level frets at those kind of prices especially from the majority of brands, (although Squier, Danelectro, Schecter, PRS and Ibanez are pretty good), as well as cheap components being used causing sustain or tuning issues, as well as wiring typically not being good on lower end gear.\n\nI've done a lot of luthiery work on my own gear, from leveling, crowning and polishing frets, replacing frets, building a replacement neck and replacing pretty much every component on the guitar.  I'm not saying everything to be an elitist asshole, but just to qualify my opinion.  But I genuinely do feel a major playability difference between a 2000 dollar Kiesel and a 750-1000 dollar Indonesian made instrument.\n\nIt does also depend on styles somewhat too.  Most of what I am playing is prog metal or neo-classical Yngwie like stuff where one does need a rather low action to play their best.  Not impossible to rip on a poor setup, but certainly much harder.\n\nAlso if the high end piece of gear makes you more inspired to pick it up and play, or play for longer, I feel they earn their value that way too.", "But that\u2019s how you feel playing it, it\u2019s not how much $$$ you will make playing it \ud83d\ude02", "Not agreeing with the boyfriend here at all, OP is correct that a car with the context given is the right choice to buy.
