Would the general public know it's her? Did she mention you or her bother. I know somepeople would say it doesn't matter but to me it does. If she wants to go on someone random discussion board and talk about the name that is her business where it becomes a problem is if she calls you and your husband out personal and people knnow who you are. It's her opinion on the name. I see why it's hurtful to you but that is only because on some level you care about her opinion.

She probably needs to get called out more. \n\nAnd people need to stop being so weirdly invested in other people's names.  OP said the name was not insane.

If she has an issue with it, she should've told you face to face, which she didn't have the guts to do.\n\n\nYou're an arse for calling her a bitch, or calling any woman a bitch.
