Bob wants the credit and all the work you did. Now he's mad he has to put in some actual effort now.", "FUCK BOB!", "Leaning towards an ESH here. Realistically, Bob's much more of a dick for being a useless freeloader and acting surprised that he won't benefit from what is primarily your work.\n\nYou also aren't communicating well and are being a little bit deceptive, which is unbecoming of a professional. Next time, if you want to utilize your contributors effectively, delegate and be very clear about what you expect from them and hold them accountable not just at the end, but throughout.\n\nCredit them for their 10%, ditch Bob and try to lead more efficiently.", "ESH. You suck for not giving a heads-up to him (for example when doing the project telling him that if he doesn't contribute more, you're not going to share the results, this could push him to do more and you wouldn't be here writing that post). \nHe sucks because he is lazy and want to be rewarded for someone else's work.", "YTA for not giving a heads up. You knew you were screwing over a friend for an important project. \n\nDon't get me wrong, you deserve 90% of the credit for doing 90% of the work, and your friend is an AH for not contributing, but you still could have handled the situation better.", "ESH. Look, I get you did all the work and you deserve all the credit.I reamed a guy on my final project because he completely misunderstood his part in the project and refused to show his progress until a couple days before the deadline. He got an awful grade for the project. You are N T A for not allowing him to get credit on the project. You are TA for not telling him what you would be doing. You should have told him and just dealt with the argument then and there.", "ESH. This is why I hate group projects when the affect a grade. Also, OP, in the real world your behaviour would be seen as unprofessional and petty, so, in the future, don't do more of the work than is your due and then act like a jerk.", "YTA OP, Were you taking control of the project because you didn\u2019t think your classmates would complete it as well as you, or were they lazy? \n\n\nIf they were lazy you should have gotten some courage and had your group contribute equally through the project. If it was the former, you need to do better with your group work. \nDefinitely should not have done all this shady shit. Be a good human and at least have the decency to give him a heads up. \n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong he\u2019s an AH too for not doing the work and then expecting credit. \n\nStand out in engineering and learn some social skills. \nLight jab there\u2026but I\u2019m also serious.

With friends like that, who needs enemies?", "OP also intentionally made Bob believe he can use this project only to pull the rug under him the last moment. If Bob knew he could have prepared something else now he likely have to do an extra semester for it. if he just told Bob outright I'd be on OP's side but this was manipulative and malicious, clear AH territory.\n\nBob still is also AH for being lazy of course.", "Agreed. Nothing excuses not giving notice. There's also the question of *why* OP did 90% of the work. Was it really because Bob was lazy or did OP take over the project?\n\nI've been in both situations.", "This, \ud83d\udcaf", "Good point on the why. I've also had a group project where I basically did the whole thing, but only because it was just so much more convenient to do alone. OP should answer why he did all the work and didn't spread it out evenly.", "NTA. You don't need a friend like bob.", "ESH\nIf the work has already been marked for credit in your degree (I assume that you were getting credits for the international exchange) then you're committing academic misconduct by reusing it. Self-plagiarism is how it would be described.", "lmaooo this sub is wild. dude wanted to do zero work but take the project and pass it off as his own so he could do even less work on another project and look good and he outright told OP that boldly. OP is under no obligation to have to tell someone why that kind of request is just utterly bonkers, it's common fucking sense.   \nso you're actually over here mad at OP for not babying someone's shitty behavior and telling them they were getting screwed over? that's wild  \n\n\n\"oh but OP could at least give him a heads up\"  \noh but that dude could just not be a lazy piece of waste and do his share. plus if you tellh im no, it gives him a chance to get mad and find a way to undermine that no and retaliate and why the hell would you wanna give him that chance?  \n\n\nNTA", "Yup. Struck me as spiteful. Frustration is more than understandable with people like Bob.

But minor suck for not talking with him ahead of time.\n\nI think you chose passively to end this friendship.", "ESH. When I read the question I originally leaned towards NTA but after reading the post I think there are a couple of issues with how you acted. Why did you do 90% of the project? There should have been equal division of work and holding each other accountable. It was really shady of you to (1) add a footnote that you were the main contributor and (2) not tell Bob up front that you didn\u2019t feel like he contributed enough to use the project to fulfill his other requirement. You come across a bit full of yourself and that instead of having open and frank discussions with your classmates on how you think they aren\u2019t contributing enough, you act sneaky and undermine them at the last minute.", "YTA what a spiteful little person, at least have the decency to tell him beforehand if you really think he doesn't deserve any credit", "Bob will have a delightful future in middle management where he does things like nag staff to work on things that they are already working on, keeping track of people's bathroom breaks, and playing games on his phone.", "OHHH YEAH NTA.", "He wasn\u2019t the lead though, and didn\u2019t have the authority over the others. \n\nBob was intending on plagiarizing the report, which is a severe professional breach. \n\nOP correctly gave credit where it was due. \n\nSenior projects are important in engineering and can be the make or break on hiring. Allowing Bob to take credit for the work could impact OPs ability to get a job. And the whole point of a senior project is to show off **your** engineering ability. What would happen when an interviewer will ask about the details of the project. Let me assure you, they always ask about the senior project. \n\nShould OP have given a heads up?  Yes. He should have shut that down immediately. But in the end, Bob was planning on plagiarism. In the world of engineering, that could be a fireable offense.", "I came here to say this, Bob told him what he planned - OP should have told him he wouldn't allow that so he could do an alternative project. However, Bob shouldn't have taken his friend for granted and assumed he could get away with that.", "For me, I've been the other person too.  I was working on an online zine as a passion project with another person. The deadline we'd decided on wasn't for about 4 months. I was really busy planning a big event for the first month and a half but then my schedule opened up after which I'd have plenty time to work and I told this to my partner. \n\nAfter the event I logged on to the project to find about 90% of the design work, everything besides the couple I'd started early, was done. My partner's response was \"oops. I was having fun\". I ended up doing pretty much all the background not-fun nitty gritty work so I could say I did SOMETHING. Total work load probably ended up around 70/30. I ended up demanding that the pages I copy edited have my name on them too so it wouldn't look to our readers that I was slacking off (my partner had put \"edited by_____\" on all the pages so it'd have been obvious). \n\nI was pissed. Still am when I think back on it. \n\nSo yeah, OP saying they did 90% of the work isn't enough for me.", "Don't have anything else to add just saying love that name.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a I use it for everything \ud83d\ude05", "NTA.. lazy, entitled people are the worst.", "NTA idk what these E S H and Y T A people are on but you're certainly not in the wrong for not giving a coaster notice that he can't use a project he hardly worked on for something that would benefit him. He should've done more work if he wanted to use this paper, did he think you were just going to take that?", "What's really funny is if he even bothered to proofread it then he woulda caught it. Like the fact no one in your group caught it is pretty solid proof to me that they didn't contribute. I know circumstantial evidence and whatnot but still."]}
