Bob wants the credit and all the work you did. Now he's mad he has to put in some actual effort now.", "FUCK BOB!", "Leaning towards an ESH here. Realistically, Bob's much more of a dick for being a useless freeloader and acting surprised that he won't benefit from what is primarily your work.\n\nYou also aren't communicating well and are being a little bit deceptive, which is unbecoming of a professional. Next time, if you want to utilize your contributors effectively, delegate and be very clear about what you expect from them and hold them accountable not just at the end, but throughout.\n\nCredit them for their 10%, ditch Bob and try to lead more efficiently.", "ESH. You suck for not giving a heads-up to him (for example when doing the project telling him that if he doesn't contribute more, you're not going to share the results, this could push him to do more and you wouldn't be here writing that post). \nHe sucks because he is lazy and want to be rewarded for someone else's work.", "YTA for not giving a heads up. You knew you were screwing over a friend for an important project. \n\nDon't get me wrong, you deserve 90% of the credit for doing 90% of the work, and your friend is an AH for not contributing, but you still could have handled the situation better.", "ESH. Look, I get you did all the work and you deserve all the credit.I reamed a guy on my final project because he completely misunderstood his part in the project and refused to show his progress until a couple days before the deadline. He got an awful grade for the project. You are N T A for not allowing him to get credit on the project. You are TA for not telling him what you would be doing. You should have told him and just dealt with the argument then and there.", "ESH. This is why I hate group projects when the affect a grade. Also, OP, in the real world your behaviour would be seen as unprofessional and petty, so, in the future, don't do more of the work than is your due and then act like a jerk.", "YTA OP, Were you taking control of the project because you didn\u2019t think your classmates would complete it as well as you, or were they lazy? \n\n\nIf they were lazy you should have gotten some courage and had your group contribute equally through the project. If it was the former, you need to do better with your group work. \nDefinitely should not have done all this shady shit. Be a good human and at least have the decency to give him a heads up. \n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong he\u2019s an AH too for not doing the work and then expecting credit. \n\nStand out in engineering and learn some social skills. \nLight jab there\u2026but I\u2019m also serious. I work with a lot of engineers in my day to day and you really will stand out if you\u2019re cooperative and can work effectively with a team.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

With friends like that, who needs enemies?", "OP also intentionally made Bob believe he can use this project only to pull the rug under him the last moment.

Nothing excuses not giving notice. There's also the question of *why* OP did 90% of the work. Was it really because Bob was lazy or did OP take over the project?\n\nI've been in both situations.", "This, \ud83d\udcaf", "Good point on the why. I've also had a group project where I basically did the whole thing, but only because it was just so much more convenient to do alone. OP should answer why he did all the work and didn't spread it out evenly."]}
