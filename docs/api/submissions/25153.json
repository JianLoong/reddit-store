I became fond of them and they became fond of me. You could say we became friends, even if maybe they saw me as a surrogate grandson. The wife sadly passed away last December; the husband is now living alone, and I made of habit of dropping by a few times a week to see if he needs anything or just to keep him company for a while.\n\nCut to: his daughter (mid-50sF) got my contact when she came to visit her father a month ago (she lives in another state). 2 days ago she texted me to ask me if I could help her father take his daily medicine, because apparently he was skipping some doses (maybe he forgot about it, maybe it was a choice not to take them, I\u2019m not sure). So I said I could, but asked her what she could pay me to do that. That caught her by surprise \u2013 \u201cwhy would I need to be paid? I was there every day anyway\u201d.\n\nI explained to her I drop by whenever I can out of fondness for her father - I\u2019m not obliged to go every day; if I take on this responsibility, one that would be part of a \u201cto do\u201d list of a hired caretaker (that would have to be paid by my neighbor\u2019s daughter), I\u2019d have to change my schedule to make sure I'd be there at a specific time every day. She replied I could just drop by whenever I came home from work. I told her it\u2019s not that simple, since there are days I don\u2019t come home straight away, there are days I go for drinks afterwards, there are days I sleep at my boyfriend\u2019s, and so on. After a few exchanges, when she realized I was serious about being paid, she accused me of being selfish to deny help to her father when it wouldn\u2019t \u201ccost me anything\u201d.\n\nThe truth is, now that I know this is an issue (he\u2019s not taking his medicines), I\u2019m inclined to do what I can to help, because I really care about him.

Yes, such caregiving is too often expected by the entitled to be unpaid, and it can get grueling. Your neighbor needs more than you could do already and will likely need additional care. Don't agree to be a caregiver, even for money, as just having an eye on the elder counts so much more than you're getting appreciation for from the daughter. You don't need the regimen or the obligation or the legal liability when casual visits can help your old neighbor have a glass of water but also get added care when necessary, and it will be increasingly necessary.\n\nAre there elder social workers or care agency services available locally? Would your neighbor be willing to share with you a pharmacy label with a doctor's name who could be contacted? The medical team can NOT answer your questions \\[US\\], unless your neighbor gives you a medical power of attorney, but **you can inform them** that your neighbor may be in need of evaluation for home assistance, which might even be available or subsidized, etc. If the geriatric neighbor has sudden behavioral changes or sluggishness then you'd have a number you can call because infections or pneumonia could otherwise end up with serious consequences.

Heck  maybe he has a history or refusing to take meds for a paid caregiver but will do it under context of favor because men are weird/pride. So tread lightly-but at minimum daughter could buy you/make you dinner.", "NTA, she is taking advantage of your relationship with him to avoid paying for a carer. As someone who works in healthcare I see lots of patients who rely on their neighbours for this kind of care with no compensation and the neighbours always look exhausted. It is not your responsibility no matter how much you care for him. Do not start doing medicine checks just because you feel bad, hold your ground and make her pay you or a professional carer.", "NTA. For me, having to physically check in with someone around the same time every single day would actually mean completing changing my whole lifestyle. Its a 7 day a week job! The amount someone would have to pay me to make that commitment indefinitely would be astronomical. I don't think you're being unreasonable in the slightest.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRefuse that responsibility - it will hamper your own life massively.", "NTA\n\nKeep being friendful on your terms and time. You are incredible to be doing this and I am sure the man appreciates it. \n\nWatch out for the daughter and don\u2019t let her guilt you into anything. Once you agree to the meds, why don\u2019t you also do the shopping? You go to the store for your stuff anyways, and you visit him for his meds.

I would be wary about being any more than an informal carer though, as you'll start being expected to take him for appointments, personal care, cleaning which is fine on an ad hoc basis but can be a real commitment. Also, it might be worthwhile getting your neighbours relatives used to the idea that he needs regular carers going in for medication etc and you could be a helpful pair of eyes to make sure he's getting the care being paid for.", "And then, he goes to the store, right?

Is he selfish enough to have him starve, since he cannot go shopping anymore? \n\nThen it\u2019s cooking and common, clean up after yourself in the kitchen and then entire appartment and before long you have a 24/7 free senior care with OP asking if he\u2019d be an a**hole to stop\n\nEdit, missed that OP is a man", "NTA. Absolutely do not do this without a written agreement and being paid.  What happens if you can't make it one day and something happens?", "NTA - maybe you could suggest he set an alarm to take them? You don't need a smart phone to do this, although if he doesn't have a mobile, a separate alarm clock will do.", "I think it could hurt; if OP does it once or twice, it creates an expectation.

OP is male.", "Aah, thanks! Completely missed that", "No worries!
