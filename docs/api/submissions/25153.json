Yes, such caregiving is too often expected by the entitled to be unpaid, and it can get grueling. Your neighbor needs more than you could do already and will likely need additional care. Don't agree to be a caregiver, even for money, as just having an eye on the elder counts so much more than you're getting appreciation for from the daughter. You don't need the regimen or the obligation or the legal liability when casual visits can help your old neighbor have a glass of water but also get added care when necessary, and it will be increasingly necessary.\n\nAre there elder social workers or care agency services available locally? Would your neighbor be willing to share with you a pharmacy label with a doctor's name who could be contacted? The medical team can NOT answer your questions \\[US\\], unless your neighbor gives you a medical power of attorney, but **you can inform them** that your neighbor may be in need of evaluation for home assistance, which might even be available or subsidized, etc. If the geriatric neighbor has sudden behavioral changes or sluggishness then you'd have a number you can call because infections or pneumonia could otherwise end up with serious consequences.

Heck  maybe he has a history or refusing to take meds for a paid caregiver but will do it under context of favor because men are weird/pride. So tread lightly-but at minimum daughter could buy you/make you dinner.", "NTA, she is taking advantage of your relationship with him to avoid paying for a carer. As someone who works in healthcare I see lots of patients who rely on their neighbours for this kind of care with no compensation and the neighbours always look exhausted. It is not your responsibility no matter how much you care for him. Do not start doing medicine checks just because you feel bad, hold your ground and make her pay you or a professional carer.", "NTA. For me, having to physically check in with someone around the same time every single day would actually mean completing changing my whole lifestyle. Its a 7 day a week job! The amount someone would have to pay me to make that commitment indefinitely would be astronomical. I don't think you're being unreasonable in the slightest.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRefuse that responsibility - it will hamper your own life massively.", "NTA\n\nKeep being friendful on your terms and time. You are incredible to be doing this and I am sure the man appreciates it. \n\nWatch out for the daughter and don\u2019t let her guilt you into anything. Once you agree to the meds, why don\u2019t you also do the shopping? You go to the store for your stuff anyways, and you visit him for his meds.

I would be wary about being any more than an informal carer though, as you'll start being expected to take him for appointments, personal care, cleaning which is fine on an ad hoc basis but can be a real commitment. Also, it might be worthwhile getting your neighbours relatives used to the idea that he needs regular carers going in for medication etc and you could be a helpful pair of eyes to make sure he's getting the care being paid for.", "And then, he goes to the store, right?

Is he selfish enough to have him starve, since he cannot go shopping anymore? \n\nThen it\u2019s cooking and common, clean up after yourself in the kitchen and then entire appartment and before long you have a 24/7 free senior care with OP asking if he\u2019d be an a**hole to stop\n\nEdit, missed that OP is a man", "NTA. Absolutely do not do this without a written agreement and being paid.  What happens if you can't make it one day and something happens?", "NTA - maybe you could suggest he set an alarm to take them? You don't need a smart phone to do this, although if he doesn't have a mobile, a separate alarm clock will do.", "I think it could hurt; if OP does it once or twice, it creates an expectation.

No way.  She needs to hire someone who is a nurse.  If anything happens, you could get into some serious trouble.", "However fond you are of this man, I'd be really wary about this. The support you are giving him is invaluable because it's freely given, friendly drop-bys because you care about him. \n\nMore formal care needs to be put in place by the family, or social services, and paid for if necessary. Now that the daughter has shown where she's coming from, I'd hold fast to your refusal to commit to more formal 'care'; that way you remain free to provide as much friendship and support to your neighbour as suits you.", "Do what you wish.

We had 3 people alternating for an elderly man in our building as his son was working in another province. We did notice this man was not eating properly either, so when we cooked, we made a bit extra and would place frozen meals in his freezer. We never asked to be paid as we worked as a team within our schedules. Doing it solo is too much to ask.", "If you are in the US, you cannot legally administer his medicine unless you are a certified nurse. Even caretakers cannot administer medicine, only remind him when it's time to take them. The act of taking medicine out of the bottle and giving it to him without proper certification can open you up to a whole host of legal and civil liability.\n\nNTA. It sounds like his daughter doesn't want to pay a caretaker, and thinks getting a neighbor to do it for free will save her a buck. Cover yourself legally. Don't do it, paid or not.", "What I don\u2019t understand is why she needs someone to do that in person. If he\u2019s forgetting, she can call him daily and remind him.  She can set up FaceTime and watch him take the meds. If he is choosing not to take them, then what is the OP meant to do, exactly? He can\u2019t force himself into someone\u2019s home and demand they take medication against their will.", "This is great idea", "NTA - A friend's mother was in Assisted Living and when she started forgetting her meds they had to pay an extra 70$ per day to have that attended to twice a day! . . . .  If you take on an obligation like that, then you should be paid. That is to insure that you will take it as a daily duty. It's a job!", "If you accept payment for this responsibility and your neighbor suffers health complications down the road that could be attributed to the intake of his medications (eg missed doses) will you be legally liable for damages?", "There are literally machines that will remind you, and blister packs. Look up automated pill dispenser on Amazon.  28 days for $100.  There are med safes that will talk to you abd tell you its time to take your medication.  There are home supportworkers.  There are solutions the family have not looked into here.", "NTA\u2026but you need to watch out for yourself.  If you are getting paid, this could create whole other issues.   If he is forgetting, his memory might not be the best.  Who is going to be in charge of filling the planner?  What if there is a mistake made?  Or if dad takes too much?  You could be held liable.", "NTA.\n\nThat said, a suggestion to give to his daughter: they make great pill dispensers for elderly people who are starting to struggle with memory. This isn\u2019t the exact one we use, but something similar, and it has been **amazingly** helpful for managing and monitoring medications.\n\nOurs has 28 slots and since we do 2 rounds of meds a day, one pill refill can last up to 2 weeks before it needs to be  restocked.  Ours has set alarm time for the pills, and when that hits it rotates to make the slot available and there\u2019s a voice that says \u201ctime to take your medications\u201d that will periodically go off for an hour or until the unit is tipped to dispense the medications.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing and it works with your schedule you could consider being the person to reload the medications.\n\nhttps://www.alzstore.com/Pippa-Tipper-Locking-Pill-Dispenser-p/0047.htm?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Campaign%20-%20PLA%20Shopping&utm_medium=pla&gad=1", "NTA.

Don't get involved. At all. Having seen in the last few years how much drama and emotion flares up as old folks are circling the drain first hand, I would say it's not worth it.
