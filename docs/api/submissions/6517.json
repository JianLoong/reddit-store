It was a nice moment until I asked who she'd told My sister answered her husband, and now me, but that she wanted to reveal her pregnancy to our entire family at my wedding since everyone would be there. My heart sunk. I could understand why, since as she said, everyone would be there. But couldn't she have told over a call like she did last time? I didn't and still don't understand why she feels she needs to do it at my wedding. What really annoyed me though was that her tone was more of a 'I'm planning to announce it then' rather than a 'Can I announce it then?', which I would've said no to anyway.\n\nI just don't think it's fair when I've spent so much time and energy into this wedding for her to say something that would most definitely switch the attention onto her. She continued to ramble on about her pregnancy whilst I just kind of stood there until her voice got aggravating enough to the point I asked her to leave my house. She was very confused and I told her I didn't want her to announce her pregnancy at my wedding. That seemed to piss her off because she started going at me, saying that as a sister I should be supportive of her. Which I am, just not at the expense of my wedding. After about 10 minuetes of backandforth, I eventually told her that if she couldn't handle what i wanted at my wedding, then she wouldn't be invited anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe day after my mum called me, yelling at me for my sister being upset and how I was heartless for uninviting her to the wedding, when I went to her's. It was really early in the morning and I wasn't up for a yelling so I simply told my mum exactly how it was and why she got kicked out, to which she was stunned and hung up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few hours after I received a very long and angry text from my sister about how I told everyone about her pregnancy, calling me an ass for ruining the surprise and how she didn't want anyone except a select few to know this early in case of miscarriage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't responded since I'm still kind of angry at her, but at the same time, I feel bad knowing that my mum was probably the one to tell after I told her and that I was one of the few that my sister told, thinking it would be kept secret.
