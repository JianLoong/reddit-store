Nothing bougie about quiche from my point of view.  Nice hot or cold and goes with most things.", "NTA. The assholes were the ones making fun of you.\n\nThat said, there is a cultural difference. Some people come from backgrounds where the host takes care of the guests, and others come from backgrounds where everyone pitches in. So asking seems like a good idea.\n\nAs for nobody touching the quiche. That's so sad! Sometimes people don't touch a dish at a potluck until someone else \"cracks\" it. Did your spouse eat any?\n\nActually, did your spouse advocate for you at all?", "I would have probably asked if I could bring anything. You did ask your wife. Her family seems unnecessarily rude.", "NTA. That's surprising nobody even tried it. It's rude they poked fun. Oh well though- you never have to bring anything again!", "I don't think you're an asshole but quiche is not a traditional Thanksgiving dish, so maybe it just surprised your wife's family.  In the future, ask if they need anything or bring a hostess gift, flowers, a bottle of wine, etc. Don't over think it. Personally, if I was hosting, it wouldn't bother me. I'd just heat it up and put it out with the rest of the food.", "With things Iike Thanksgiving people usually have established dishes. I don't think Thanksgiving dinner is the time to bring an extra side. You definitely should have asked the hosts before bringing something. I understand it's your family's tradition but you should try to understand what their traditions are when going to their houses. I wouldn't go so far as calling you an AH but I can definitely see the misstep because it's one I've made myself.\n\nI brought a cake to Thanksgiving at the request of one of the guests and everyone looked at me like I was crazy. They said well we always have these desserts at Thanksgiving. Maybe try bringing the quiche a different time.", "NTA. But next time, try alcohol. And if your wife\u2019s family sucks, drink it.", "NTA. Maybe her family called you bougie because you brought a dish that isn\u2019t commonly served at Thanksgiving dinner. It still wasn\u2019t a nice thing for them to say though. Take this as a lesson learned. Next time either bring drinks or a traditional Thanksgiving dish. If someone is else brings re same dish, that\u2019s not a problem. That\u2019s more food for everyone and it will be more leftovers to take home.", "They let you off the hook. Next time don't cook or help clean. Eat then watch football.", "I'm a bit of a control freak when I'm hosting and I like to be the one who made all the dishes. That being said, I would take it as a lovely gesture if a guest took the time to cook/bake a dish and I certainly wouldn't be rude", "NTA, generally asking the host is proper courtesy (in case they need something specific, other guests have allergies, etc) but your wife said it would be okay.  I mean if my partner wanted to make something for my family's dinner, I know they would love it.  We see thanksgiving as a feast, more food, the merrier.  My cousin's wife is Hispanic and makes a Spanish dish each thanksgiving to share.\n\nIf they had any kind of problem with bringing food, I would know.  It's people I've literally known my whole life.  So if my partner asked if he could bring a certain dish, and I said that was okay, I wouldn't expect him to go calling my family to double check with them.  I know my family and if I had any doubts, I would call them.\n\nHer family are A H for insulting you about it and not even trying a bite.  Your own wife was too nervous to get a piece because of how awkward her family was making it (OP mentions this in the comments).  The adult thing to do would make a polite excuse such as \"Sorry, this is a family tradition we do every year, so we keep the menu the same.  Perhaps we can save this for breakfast tomorrow\".", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in the future, let your wife handle the things to bring to your inlaws. SHE told you it was fine, so why would you ask somoen else.", "NTA. It's polite to ask the host if you can bring anything. That being said you spoke to your wife and she said it was okay. Did you and your wife at least eat the quiche? Were your wife's parents upset or just her cousins and aunts?", "Did someone say leftover quiche? Even more than pizza quiche tastes great the next day. Or the same day. Any day really. NTA.", "Nta.  They sound pretentious maybe it was too common for them.  I was raised to bring things too.  My dad usually does cheesecake and my mom marshmallow squares.  Its just normal to do.  \n\nMy parents regularly have unrelated guests over for weekends.  They almost all ask what to bring, get told don't worry about it and show up with food and wine or beer.  Sometimes a lot of food.   I think when they ask what to bring and get told 'nothing' it actually bothers most of them as it leaves them guessing.  Its actually kind of funny when people don't bring something in a group, because they really so stand out.", "I can see both sides. You had good intentions, but I can also see how in some families it would be taken as a sign that their food isn't good enough, so you had to bring something just in case. Always ask the host/hostess if there is anything you can bring, don't assume or choose on your own. They could have been more gracious. Soft ESH", "NTA.  Nobody respectable would ever insult someone else for being \"bougie\".", "NTA\n\nThis family sounds rude.\nI would honestly eat the quiche, I find other thanksgiving food mostly inedible", "NTA but like, a quiche at thanksgiving? You live, you learn.", "NTA- Sounds like they are from hillbilly land. Who mocks someone for cooking? And quiche is definitely not \u201cbougie\u201d \ud83e\udd23", "They are rude assholes", "NTA - the real issue is that you followed a custom or tradition that's relevant to you: bringing a dish along to dinner. \n\nWhile it's true that there may have been a cultural difference on their end, (such as maybe thinking it's rude to bring food to dinner as it could imply you don't think the hosts food will be 'enough',) MOST reasonable adults can be gracious enough to recognize when someone is extended an offer of politeness, even if it's a custom that's different from their own. \n\nIt was totally rude and uncalled for for them to make comments about it, and not even try it.", "NTA. I was also brought up with the idea that if you are invited to a party/meal, you bring something.  Next time,  unless asked to bring food, try bringing something for the hosts. I believe I read something like wine earlier. Maybe a nice fruit tray. I don't think you did anything wrong. I will say, I thought the reaction was rude. Good luck.\n\nEdit for spelling.", "NTA.
