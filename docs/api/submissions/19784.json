Some people come from backgrounds where the host takes care of the guests, and others come from backgrounds where everyone pitches in. So asking seems like a good idea.\n\nAs for nobody touching the quiche. That's so sad! Sometimes people don't touch a dish at a potluck until someone else \"cracks\" it.

Oh well though- you never have to bring anything again!", "[deleted]", "With things Iike Thanksgiving people usually have established dishes. I don't think Thanksgiving dinner is the time to bring an extra side. You definitely should have asked the hosts before bringing something. I understand it's your family's tradition but you should try to understand what their traditions are when going to their houses. I wouldn't go so far as calling you an AH but I can definitely see the misstep because it's one I've made myself.\n\nI brought a cake to Thanksgiving at the request of one of the guests and everyone looked at me like I was crazy.

It still wasn\u2019t a nice thing for them to say though. Take this as a lesson learned. Next time either bring drinks or a traditional Thanksgiving dish. If someone is else brings the same dish, that\u2019s not a problem. That\u2019s more food for everyone and it will be more leftovers to take home.", "They let you off the hook. Next time don't cook or help clean. Eat then watch football.", "I'm a bit of a control freak when I'm hosting and I like to be the one who made all the dishes.

I mean if my partner wanted to make something for my family's dinner, I know they would love it.  We see thanksgiving as a feast, more food, the merrier.  My cousin's wife is Hispanic and makes a Spanish dish each thanksgiving to share.\n\nIf they had any kind of problem with bringing food, I would know.  It's people I've literally known my whole life.

I know my family and if I had any doubts, I would call them.\n\nHer family are A H for insulting you about it and not even trying a bite.  Your own wife was too nervous to get a piece because of how awkward her family was making it (OP mentions this in the comments).

My dad usually does cheesecake and my mom marshmallow squares.  Its just normal to do.  \n\nMy parents regularly have unrelated guests over for weekends.  They almost all ask what to bring, get told don't worry about it and show up with food and wine or beer.  Sometimes a lot of food.   I think when they ask what to bring and get told 'nothing' it actually bothers most of them as it leaves them guessing.  Its actually kind of funny when people don't bring something in a group, because they really so stand out.", "I can see both sides. You had good intentions, but I can also see how in some families it would be taken as a sign that their food isn't good enough, so you had to bring something just in case.

My mother\u2019s system, meanwhile, is to plan an elaborate meal, refuse every offer of help, and then get overwhelmed at the last minute and serve holiday meals 3, 4, 5 hours late, *which I always thought was normal* until DH started pointing out that this is the exact sort of problem a potluck solves. She\u2019d rather die, though, so they\u2019ve reached a tacit agreement: she plans this wild abundance, she shops for it, she insists she\u2019s got it under control this time, and then we show up a day or two early and DH cooks it for her while she enjoys some wine and grandchildren. \n\nTalking is the way.
