You say you're boyfriend isn't the type, so instead of trusting him to be true to himself, you freak out about something he might have done that wasn't his idea in the first place.

I went again with the same group about a year later.\n\nAlso went to a different strip club for one of my co-resident\u2019s bachelor party (12 radiology residents and I was the only woman, so I got invited with everyone else).

It was all just regular people there, all 3 times. I didn\u2019t see anything wrong; I\u2019ve seen lap dances and they\u2019re acrobatically cool and are harmless. Some of the women were objectively hot, some weren\u2019t. Some were more talented dancers than others. \n\nStrip clubs aren\u2019t orgies. Keep your hands off the staff and you\u2019ll have fun.

No one is arguing that. However the person I replied to was saying it was a red flag that she didn\u2019t trust her partner.

Her reaction is not independent of her feelings.\n\nI agree with you any human being is right to be concerned if they are told that their boundary is being violated but she wasn\u2019t just concerned which is evident by her reaction. The way she reacted isn\u2019t from someone who is emotionally stable, the her emotional feelings led to this response is a red flag.\n\nIt is a red flag if you throw away all trust off your partner from hearsay. The bride who told her this wasn\u2019t even present, she overheard a conversation through the phone with her fianc\u00e9 that didn\u2019t even involve her partner!  \n\nIf you feel that someone overhearing a possibility of your partner going to a strip club from two people who aren\u2019t your partner is enough to not trust your partner that\u2019s a huge red flag that you have. \n\nIt\u2019s baffling you think that losing trust over an unconfirmed rumour so easily is not a red flag, you\u2019re probably holding that flag yourself."]}
