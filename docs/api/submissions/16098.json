I'm a foreigner, lived on the US for ~10 years, my husband is American. We've been married 2 years, together for 4 years, and just had a baby 2 weeks ago. \n\n\nThe baby part is important because it's part of our argument. Today, while my husband and baby were napping, I went to a grocery store. We needed a few things and I wanted to go outside, have some away from the baby time.\n\nFew months into pregnancy I got a bad brain fog and it's not really gone. Physically, things are also still healing and with the interrupted sleep, it's both my brain and body that are slow. I try to compensate and have my coping strategies like a shopping list, going to a specific cashier, etc\n\nEither way, I got to the conveyor belt and started to put my shopping out while also double checking it against my shopping list. While I started to unload, some guy suddenly stood super close to me and pushed my cart lightly. I looked at him, said 'excuse me' and continued on my task. When I put the divider between our shopping, he grabbed it and pushed it so my fruits and vegetables got squished together. Then he started to pile his shopping on, while keeping to push my things forward. So, I said 'do you mind not squishing my food?'. The guy angrily yelled at me to move it up and called me a 'fat bitch'. That's when the cashier interjected and asked him to stop harassing me. To which he started to cuss me out, calling me out on being a foreigner, intellectually disabled, etc. I yelled back for him to shut up and that he's not the only person in this store. The manager was called, and the guy was moved to a different check out. When leaving, he once again yelled at me, and then followed me out of the store, cussing me out. \n\nWhen I got home and told my husband about it, he was upset that I started the interaction and said I should have ignored the guy. He brought up the recent Texas shooting and said he's not comfortable with me taking our baby out by myself if I cannot walk away from a conflict.\n\nI'm pissed off he didn't back me up and offer support, and told him I'll take the baby wherever I please and he has no right to tell me what to do. Our raised voices woke up the baby, so the conversation ended and we haven't spoken since.

He called me an asshole for putting our child's life at risk just so I can be in the right and have the last word.

You and your husband are just sleep deprived parents of a newborn and both over reacted a bit. NAH. Hang in there.", "NAH  \n\n\nYou're definitely NTA, but I don't think I would call your husband one either.\n\nI will never fault anyone for standing up for themself.  The guy at the grocery store was a complete asshole and should have been kicked out of the store instead of being sent into a different checkout line.   \n\n\nThat being the said, the sad state of the world is that your husband isn't wrong.  You never know what one of these mouth breathers is going to do when you have the nerve to talk back to them (I'll give you one guess who he voted for in 2020).  Speaking up for yourself *is* the right thing to do, but by doing so you run the risk of escalating the situation.    \n\n\nOne thing to note though, you didn't start the interaction.  The asshole in the checkout line did.", "Your husband cant restrict you or where you go. But he does have a say regarding the baby. That's not to say that he didn't overreact to a mild argument in a grocery store argument.", "NTA - he should 100% have backed you up in a situation where another man was acting  like that towards you. I guess from his perspective, he perhaps reacted out of fear and concern for your safety? It was probably a shock to hear and maybe he's annoyed at himself for not being there to support you. Honestly his advice was terrible but it was probably a shock/ wake up call for him, which is why he reacted that way. Being in Australia, it's wild to see the shootings that go on.. I hope you both stay safe, OP.", "NTH- Neither of you are. You both just have different perspectives. I understand the need to defend yourself, but your husband's right in his comment. That man followed you and continued to harass you even though you had your baby with you. You never know what people will do, so when your child can be at risk, it's best to let things go.", "NAH and both of you do sound stressed. You should have to put up with a crazy guy at the store harassing you. That said, his fears are sadly not unfounded.", "NTA so you got attacked, and your husband's instinct is to yell at you about it and forbid you from being with your child? You didn't start the incident. You were attacked. The call is coming from inside the house. =X Mom's aren't the only ones who can suffer from increased anxiety and mental health problems when navigating parenthood. Your husband should see a therapist before he destroys his marriage trying to be what he sees as a good father.", "NAH\n\nTHB, where you currently live and the fact that you're visibly a foreigner, he's 100% right that you should be avoiding conflicts at all costs.  Sticking up for yourself sounds great in theory, but people are getting shot every day for no reason in this country, especially non-white people.  He has every right to want his baby to be safe.", "OP, I only have one question for you \u201cwould you be okay or have reacted differently had the roles reversed? Would you have reacted calmly had your husband put up a fight with a random AH while holding your extremely young baby?\u201d \n\nAs much of an AH the other guy was and as much as brain fogged you have been, I hate to say this but your husband was right. He put your and the baby\u2019s safety first. I agree he should have let you rant and supported you while you did so and later on put it across more calmly. But he most certainly has a point, I would suggest you start therapy to recover from your brain fog and have a calm conversation with your husband about this whole thing.", "NAH", "NTA - Actually, it sounds like the guy should have been removed from the store. I don't understand what your husband's issue is.", "Your husband is an AH for not hearing you and not siding with you. You\u2019re NTA. If something like that ever happens again you are in the right to call the police that you were being threatened. Conveyor belt dude was a prick and should\u2019ve been in the back of a patrol car after that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His sensitivities are  heightened right now.  \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, and even the cashier understood that.    \n\nI don't think this has anything to deal with walking away.
