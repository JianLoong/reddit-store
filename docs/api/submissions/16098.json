Today, while my husband and baby were napping, I went to a grocery store. We needed a few things and I wanted to go outside, have some away from the baby time.\n\nFew months into pregnancy I got a bad brain fog and it's not really gone. Physically, things are also still healing and with the interrupted sleep, it's both my brain and body that are slow. I try to compensate and have my coping strategies like a shopping list, going to a specific cashier, etc\n\nEither way, I got to the conveyor belt and started to put my shopping out while also double checking it against my shopping list. While I started to unload, some guy suddenly stood super close to me and pushed my cart lightly. I looked at him, said 'excuse me' and continued on my task. When I put the divider between our shopping, he grabbed it and pushed it so my fruits and vegetables got squished together. Then he started to pile his shopping on, while keeping to push my things forward. So, I said 'do you mind not squishing my food?'. The guy angrily yelled at me to move it up and called me a 'fat bitch'. That's when the cashier interjected and asked him to stop harassing me. To which he started to cuss me out, calling me out on being a foreigner, intellectually disabled, etc. I yelled back for him to shut up and that he's not the only person in this store. The manager was called, and the guy was moved to a different check out. When leaving, he once again yelled at me, and then followed me out of the store, cussing me out. \n\nWhen I got home and told my husband about it, he was upset that I started the interaction and said I should have ignored the guy. He brought up the recent Texas shooting and said he's not comfortable with me taking our baby out by myself if I cannot walk away from a conflict.\n\nI'm pissed off he didn't back me up and offer support, and told him I'll take the baby wherever I please and he has no right to tell me what to do.

And I understand that you want his support and you deserve that. \n\nNeither of you are the AH here but I think you have to talk about this again but change your perspective a bit. Your husband needs to see that the answer to the scary sh*t happening outside is not just taking any abuse from strangers and I think you should acknowledge that your husband has some understandable anxiety when it comes to your and your baby's safety.

He started screaming at you irrationally before you ever fought back.  His attack on you did not require your participation to blow up - the man was a crazy racist, who wanted to attack you.\n\nYour husband seems to be suffering from the delusion that, at least in some way, POC could do \"something\" to change the outcome of racist interactions.  That is completely wrong, and ignorant of him to think otherwise.\n\nAlso, you should call the store and discuss how poorly this incident was handled.  And if their response is not good enough, elevate it to corporate.  And then to social media.  The fact that they continued to let this man shop in the store, and then allowed him to follow you out of the store screaming and cursing at you, was EXTREMELY irresponsible and unsafe of them.  They owe you a formal apology.", "NTA, did he really blame you for a guy being racist/bigot??? You handled that the way you needed to.", "NAH.", "NAH\n\nYou didn\u2019t try to start conflict - you asked a reasonable question to grocery store dude (who is DEFINITELY an AH and was for sure trying to push your buttons to provoke you into a situation where he could flip out on you), and only argued/reacted after it escalated. \n\nHowever - and I really hate that this is the case - I also see your husband\u2019s point.

Mischaracterising and misrepresenting fear and worry as toxic masculinity needs to end.\n\nI agree with your sentiment completely but it\u2019s not related to my reply unfortunately. Not to mention the comment I replied to literally completely invalidated the fact that the kid is husband's as well. My issue is it promotes sexist stereotypes about the kid only being the mother's and minimising the fact that he as a man can experience the same fear and worry for his child as the mother rather than it being reduced to \"man angry at woman and her child\". He did not say what he said out of racism.
