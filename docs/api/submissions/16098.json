I'm a foreigner, lived on the US for ~10 years, my husband is American. We've been married 2 years, together for 4 years, and just had a baby 2 weeks ago. \n\n\nThe baby part is important because it's part of our argument. Today, while my husband and baby were napping, I went to a grocery store. We needed a few things and I wanted to go outside, have some away from the baby time.\n\nFew months into pregnancy I got a bad brain fog and it's not really gone. Physically, things are also still healing and with the interrupted sleep, it's both my brain and body that are slow. I try to compensate and have my coping strategies like a shopping list, going to a specific cashier, etc\n\nEither way, I got to the conveyor belt and started to put my shopping out while also double checking it against my shopping list. While I started to unload, some guy suddenly stood super close to me and pushed my cart lightly. I looked at him, said 'excuse me' and continued on my task. When I put the divider between our shopping, he grabbed it and pushed it so my fruits and vegetables got squished together. Then he started to pile his shopping on, while keeping to push my things forward. So, I said 'do you mind not squishing my food?'. The guy angrily yelled at me to move it up and called me a 'fat bitch'. That's when the cashier interjected and asked him to stop harassing me. To which he started to cuss me out, calling me out on being a foreigner, intellectually disabled, etc. I yelled back for him to shut up and that he's not the only person in this store. The manager was called, and the guy was moved to a different check out. When leaving, he once again yelled at me, and then followed me out of the store, cussing me out. \n\nWhen I got home and told my husband about it, he was upset that I started the interaction and said I should have ignored the guy. He brought up the recent Texas shooting and said he's not comfortable with me taking our baby out by myself if I cannot walk away from a conflict.\n\nI'm pissed off he didn't back me up and offer support, and told him I'll take the baby wherever I please and he has no right to tell me what to do. Our raised voices woke up the baby, so the conversation ended and we haven't spoken since. AITA?\n\nEdit/update: \n\nI wanted to clarify that I didn't have a baby with me, the baby was with my husband at home. \n\n\nAlso, a lot of people assume I'm brown since I'm a foreigner. I'm not, I have darker coloring but many Italians do. I have a strong accent so most people know right away I'm not American. Stereotypes suck too though as does xenophobia. Casual racism is out of control.\n\n\nHusband and I still haven't talked, but I'll show him this post and we'll discuss.

He started screaming at you irrationally before you ever fought back.  His attack on you did not require your participation to blow up - the man was a crazy racist, who wanted to attack you.\n\nYour husband seems to be suffering from the delusion that, at least in some way, POC could do \"something\" to change the outcome of racist interactions.  That is completely wrong, and ignorant of him to think otherwise.\n\nAlso, you should call the store and discuss how poorly this incident was handled.  And if their response is not good enough, elevate it to corporate.  And then to social media.  The fact that they continued to let this man shop in the store, and then allowed him to follow you out of the store screaming and cursing at you, was EXTREMELY irresponsible and unsafe of them.
