They are being inconsiderate and I wouldn't consider them friends anymore if they only reach out when they need something.\n\nNot that you did anything wrong, it's understandable after all this that you would reply like you did.

You could have taken a long time to answer question-texts and just said, \"I'm not sure but I bet you can google it.\"", "NTA \n\nToo often people feel obligated to help out crappy friends because they grew up together, when in reality they wouldn't choose that relationship as an adult.

What you describe is not a friend -- at least not according to your definition of a friend.  \nI believe we all have some people in our lives like this, the encounters are more transactional than purely getting together or being in contact for the pleasure of one's company.\n\nIf you've had enough of these utilitarian friendships, consider demoting this person to being less than a friend. He or she is an acquaintance. The obligations to an acquaintance are less than those of a friend. Viewing the person from this POV may lessen your disappointment and your sense of responsibility to this person.\n\nAs for having been close when younger, consider that people grow apart. A childhood friend may not transition into a lifelong friend. Sometimes, the past is best left in the past.", "Nta. You call them friends but they are not.  You have no interaction with them as friends.  Your only interaction is as their free tech support. If you are happy with this arrangement then continue.  If not stop.
