{"id": 1759, "submission_id": "yp8h7y", "title": "AITA for not moving to the back for my son's girlfriend?", "selftext": "My ex-husband bought our son, David (17), a brand new car for his birthday. David has been dating Madeline (17) for 6 months now and whenever they go anywhere he insists that she sits in the front. I was always against this. If a parent or grandparent is in the car it's very disrespectful to make them sit in the back so a teenager can take the front seat. He makes his brother, Jason (15), move to the back all the time for Madeline even though Jason's family. \n\nDavid and Madeline were going out and I needed to run errands in that area so I decided to ride there with them and have them drop me off/pick me up since it was on the way. \n\nWe were going to the car and I got in the front seat. David told me to move to the back because Madeline always sits in the front but I refused because, like I said, I believe it's very disrespectful for an adult to have to sit in the back so a teenager can sit in the front. After a little back and forth, they got in Madeline's car. My son drove and Madeline got to the front seat before me and refused to move so I had to sit in the back. We got into another argument on the way there and I took his car keys as punishment. \n\nThey dropped me off at the mall and I did my returns, did some shopping, and got some food. David and Madeline were taking a lot longer than I expected so I called David and he didn't answer. 10 minutes later I got a call from Jason saying that David and Madeline were at the house and were loading David's stuff into her car. \n\nI got home a little over an hour later and David's room had been cleared out and his car was gone. He left a note saying that he's going to live with his dad because I don't respect him, which is complete bullshit. I got a call from my ex saying I needed to return the car keys by the end of the day or else he'd get the police involved. \n\nJason's saying I fucked up and should've just given Madeline the front seat but he also agrees that David's being dramatic. My friends agree that David and Madeline were both very rude but I wanted more opinions.", "created_utc": 1667874142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp8h7y/aita_for_not_moving_to_the_back_for_my_sons/", "score": 668, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now whether or not you get disrespected on the bus, well, we'll have to wait for you're next post to find out.", "Sounds like you really can\u2019t stand Madeline.

First you invite yourself on their date, then you insist that your son\u2019s gf not sit by him? They could have said no to you coming and been well within reason to do so. You being in that car AT ALL is a courtesy! Then you have the audacity to punish him because they sat where they want IN THE GF\u2019S CAR?! Where you have absolutely ZERO authority?!", "YTA-You don\u2019t get to dictate who sits where in someone else\u2019s car and grossly overreacted in an attempt at a foolish power play.", "INFO: who owns the car?", "YTA sorry.  Pretty typical for couples to sit together in a car.

Want to ride shotgun? Drive your own damn car. Problem solved.", "YTA\n\nThis was a complete power move on your part. It's not the 60s anymore. You should've just climbed into the back seat and bit your tongue.", "Sorry, YTA. It sounds like you don't have much respect for your son or his own possessions. It's his car; your feelings about sitting in the back and not liking it are one thing, but taking his keys as some kind of retribution is wild.\n\n> I decided to ride there with them and have them drop me off/pick me\n\nEven the language you use here makes it sound like you're diciding these things for him. Did you ask if that was okay? Sounds passively controlling to me.\n\nThe fact you simply dismiss him feeling  disrespected as \"complete bullshit\" without adding anything more for context speaks volumes to me.", "YTA.  It's his car and he's driving.  If he wants he can choose who sits in the front with him.  You also really don't get to choose where you sit when he's doing you a favor and letting you tag along. He might have overreacted by moving out, but I suspect that you try to control his life in other ways.\n\nYour son is a man now (even if you sill see him as a little boy), and it's time you start treating him this way if you want to have a healthy relationship with him going forward.", "YTA. They were on a date and you imposed on them to run errands. I was raised to yield to adults in the front seat. However, there is no way I would insist on sitting in the front seat of my son's car when I am knowing I chose to tag along with them.  How awkward that had to be for them.", "YTA \n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand the respect of letting an older person sit in the front seat as it's courtesy in my culture. However, you're completely in the wrong here because \n\n1. They were doing you a favour\n2. It's HIS car therefore, you have no authority over it \n3. You've paid no expense towards it to even grant you a slight edge \n4. You tried getting in the girlfriend's front seat? (Level of entitlement is crazy ) \n5. You abused your power as his mother by taking his keys which by law you have no right to do so as it's your son's property paid by your ex \n\nDon't know why you're shocked about the outcome plus he's treating his girlfriend respectfully.  \n\nAlong with that, if you're attacking his manners and ethics then you're partially to blame because parents are responsible to teach their kids such things.", "YTA.\n\nIn about a year, you\u2019ll start to wonder why your son never comes over. You\u2019ll have no one to blame but yourself.", "YTA\n\nYou imposed yourself and your errands on your son and his gf for your convenience\n\nYou know full well he prefers to sit with his SO not his family members so you full on disrespected his clearly stated preferences to impose your self perpetuated ideals regarding 'respect'.\n\nYou took his personal property to punish him over this same ludicrous ideal. You are no better than a thief. You are withholding someone's rightful property until what...he agrees to perpetually haul you around and make the person he loves ride in the back?\n\nGood for him for moving out. You are very wrong with your reasoning and it has brought you inevitably to this point. You are ridiculously hard headed over this and I think it has more to do with your need to enforce your primary in your child's life rather than see his actions as growing up to be a loving considerate partner. You are the MIL who will be receiving a standard issue holiday card instead of being invited to events.\n\nYou are the parent not the owner of this person and any disrespect in this situation comes entirely from you.\n\nEdited to add: YOU FORCED YOURSELF INTO THEIR DATE", "YTA\n\nYour logic is all over the place. It is clear you just hate the GF because you even think your 13 year old should take priority over her.\n\nI guess you will start having to run your own errands now.\n\nDoes it really matter if we think you are the A H? Your son thinks you are. He has taken himself and his car out of your control.", "YTA\n\nWhat a stupid rule (the adult always gets to sit in the front seat). My teenage kids sit in the front regularly while I sit in the back. I've never felt disrespected and I even believe our relationship benefited from it, as my kids realise I see them as equals instead of inferior to me. This is a stupid hill to die on.", "I\u2019m from the Caribbean and in my culture the mom or adult would be in the front.  Only exception would be if she was his wife.  However something seems off with her reasoning.  I think it\u2019s the I\u2019m older so I sit in front but the younger son should because he\u2019s family. It makes me think she\u2019s jealous of the girlfriend.  YTA", "omg drama llamas here all around.\n\nI do think there's some hierarchy with the front seat.\n\n1. Anyone who has mobility issues/pain\n2. Anyone significantly taller or larger\n3. Then yeah if there's an adult vs a teenager or a young adult vs an older adult\n\nBut like... unless you're frail/have major arthritis/pain or are really tall/heavy (and gf isn't also large) then like... it's not a huge deal. It was not worth defying him / causing a scene / etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.\n\nI was thinking about E S H because I tend to agree that you should get the front seat over a teen, and because moving out over this sounds really dramatic... but you just made it such a big effing deal.

Getting the front seat in a car isn\u2019t the equivalent to respect, your kid is excited about having a girlfriend and wants to treat her well. The least you can do is support him and not pick fights over silly things like this", "I was taught to respect my elders by offering them the front seat and taking the back. If my bf was driving I always offered his mom the front seat. I'm in my 40s. \n\nIn this case, these are teenagers. They've been together for 6 months. They want to be close to each other. I think it's cute. \n\nWhile I get where you're coming from, you imposed yourself on them. They have every right to have some independence and space going on a date. It's more disrespectful that you pushed your expectations on to them.  If you're \"getting a ride\", take what you can get or drive yourself. YTA", "YTA - I was on the fence but when you said you were upset about your younger son being asked to sit in the back, it's clear you're just jealous of the girlfriend. It's his car, his girlfriend is important to him and you should respect that. Fix your issues before he cuts you off completely.", "Not your car not your rule. YTA.  It is a stupid rule by the way. Your beliefs should not be force into anyone else.", "YTA.  \n\nAnd this isn't just about the front seat, I guarantee it.  No one just up and moves out over an incident like that, there's always more.\n\n> so I decided to ride there with them and have them drop me off/pick me up since it was on the way.\n\nI hope you have a car since now you can't order your son to let you hijack his trips to suit you.", "YTA he is the owner of the car and was doing you a favour. All this I'm mpm/his brother is family bullshit is just annoying. It is his car and YTA.", "YTA, you don't get to demand front seat treatment. that's at the drivers discretion. The rest of your post makes you sound even more entitled. I'm glad David has a second home to go too.", "INFO: did you ask why Madeline sits in the front? If yes. What was her answer?", "YTA, it's really not that deep.. how do you feel disrespected by a seat? at least he agreed to take you, and he didn't even have to do that. my mom and grandma have both offered and gladly sat in the back seat for my partner because it's just that, a seat. That said, I'm sure him leaving also wasn't just about the seat but your disrespectful response and attitude towards him, his car, and his girlfriend. You said she always sits in the front, so you had to know you running there ahead of her would cause conflict.", "YTA. My Mom is in her 60\u2019s and has no problem sitting in the back. This sounds like little kids fighting over who gets to sit wear, honestly get over it. It isn\u2019t that big of deal, are you willing to lose your son for being so petty?", "My MIL gets in the back seat voluntarily and refuses to sit up front because she knows it's our car.\n\nYTA, it's not disrespectful. What's disrespectful is asking for special treatment because you're older. You're not disabled, car sick, or require special accommodation. You just want to be your sons top priority. \n\nThings like this make kids not want to come home for Thanksgiving dinner. Apologize, and ask yourself why sitting in the front seat of a car is worth ruining your relationship with your son.", "YTA for fighting over the front seat. Regardless of what you feel is more respectful you are still fighting over the front seat. You then abused your power as a parent to punish your son because you didn't get the front seat. You're the one that needs to be grow up in this scenario.", "YTA because it was a gift from his dad and the only way he could show his gf how adult he is and you went ballistic. His car, his rules. You humiliated him and treated him like a toddler in front of his GF. What were you saying about respect again ?", "I\u2019m having trouble deciding between Y T A and E S H. On principle, I do think it is polite to offer the front seat to the adult. If David was refusing to let his grandmother sit up front and you were upset about that, I would be saying N T A.\n\nIn my family it\u2019s not even a question - under normal circumstances Mom and Dad automatically get the front seats, as do any grandparents, aunts, or uncles. I\u2019m not into toxic seniority BS, but there are lots of practical reasons why this makes sense.\n\nBut if my brother was taking his girlfriend on a date and my mom wanted him to drop her off somewhere? She would absolutely sit in the back. My brother would ALSO offer her the front, though. I feel like the issue in this situation is that none of you respect one another at all. What I can\u2019t figure out is if your son has legitimate reason to not respect you.\n\nThere is one reason you are definitely TA: your comment on how your younger son should take precedence over the girlfriend because he\u2019s family. No, no, no. That comment makes me wonder if you have consistently been treating your son\u2019s girlfriend badly and this whole scenario was just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nSoo, I\u2019m torn, but I think I\u2019ll go with YTA.", "YTA. Not your car, you don't get to tell him who gets to sit up front. You also don't get to take the keys to the car you did not buy and do not own as punishment.", "Are you eight??? YTA, that was so childish to throw a tantrum over who gets to sit in front. If you wanted to sit up front, you should have driven.", "YTA and you sound insufferable.\nIf all your kids go LC or NC I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Being around you is probably exhausting.", "YTA. It's a car seat FFS. And then you climb onto your soapbox, screeching about respect and you stole your sons keys. (I would have called the cops on you, because you have committed a crime) and belittled him. (Respect is not a given OP. You don't seem to realise that)\nYou need to take a very serious look at your attitude because if I had been treated like that, I'd move out and stop all contact with you.", "Your complaint is that you had to ride in the back seat of your son's girlfriend's car?\n\nYou are intentionally picking a fight and then wondering why he's upset with you.\n\nYTA.", "I always sit in the front because I get car sick. My ex\u2019s mom pulled this once, but was having my ex drive her car and after the first hour I started throwing up despite taking medication. I got the front seat the remainder of the drive, but damage was done, spent the rest of the trip sick.\n\nAnyways, just a fun little anecdote, never know why someone needs the front seat, and well sounds like you were having a power trip. YTA, play stupid games win stupid prizes. Your son abandoned you, and moved out. Wonder if he will talk to you again, all because you couldn\u2019t follow his car rules, for the car his dad bought.", "YTA - I'm surprised your ego fit in a car. Enjoy being stubborn by yourself", "YTA. You got a ride, just say thank you, who cares where you seat, and in any case rich people who have drivers seat in the back, so it is probably not that bad. I suspect that there might be over underlying issues with him moving out and that this incident was just the last straw. You should really have a good think about what this might be and your part in it.", "YTA\nIt is his new car. Why do you care so much about something so unimportant? Your son can decide who travels where in his car. The disrespect is in your head. He isn't a child.", "Good God, YTA. If you want to be respected, *BE RESPECTABLE.*\n\nEdit: Seeing your responses to others, I feel the need to point out that I'm a GenXer with five adult children. And it would never occur to me to whine about seating when I was *imposing on one of them for an unnecessary ride*. What a strange hill to die on.", "I think it\u2019s a lovely gesture to let a parent or grandparent sit in the front seat while if they\u2019d like.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the A H for finding it polite, but YTA for escalating it to such a degree that he moved out. I sense there\u2019s a lot more to the story than just this one incident.", "YTA. Not really worth losing a son over, was it.\n\n(And stealing someone's car keys? Really?)", " YTA\u2014. You really went overboard to make your point. You don\u2019t get to pick where you sit in someone else\u2019s car. While it would have been nice if they had let you sit up front, it wasn\u2019t a crime that they didn\u2019t. And then taking away the keys to HIS CAR (not yours) was really a ridiculous power play. It is evident based on everyone\u2019s reaction, that this was not an unusual interaction with you and that they are now DONE having to deal with your rules and expectations about how everyone is supposed to behave.  Good job.", "YTA you invited yourself somewhere that thwy hadn't invited you to and it's his car his rules. If you don't like it, drive yourself.", "YTA it\u2019s his car, bought for him to use, he makes the rules for the car and who can ride shotgun. \n\nhe and his gf were going out together, they planned to do this and we\u2019re going to do it already without you, you decided to tag along. why do you think you should get priority over someone who was already going to be in the car before you decided to go anyway? \n\nand you took his keys as a punishment? that\u2019s overstepping, you don\u2019t own that car. yeah he\u2019s your kid but you have no legal right to have those keys, he and his father do, not you. \n\noh and your comment where you openly say you hate the gf, congrats grow tf up!", "So, here's the thing. Although I do agree that allowing the parent or grandparent to sit in the front can be seen as a sign of respect, there's other aspects of this situation to consider. \n\nThis is his car. His dad gave it to him. You have zero entitlement to this car in anyway. \n\nHe was going on a date. \n\nYou invited yourself along.....on his DATE!\n\nRespect is not a given. It's earned. Just because you are his mother does not mean you are entitled to his respect. You clearly don't respect him,  why would he respect you?\n\nJust so we're clear, I'm not a teenager. I'm a mom of two adult children. I treat them with respect, I have shown them how to be respectful and to treat others the way you want to be treated, so it's not surprising they in return treat me the same way.\n\nAlso, I voluntarily get in the backseat to let my child, now 20 into the front. I've been doing this for a few years. He always tries to give me the front, but I feel he will be more comfortable with his 6'6\" in the front, while I can easily fit my 5'4\" self in the back. Maybe think about others before yourself. \n\nWould you have enjoyed sitting in the backseat while on a date with your husband and mother in law?", "YTA because they were dropping you off and she would have had to get out and move to the front when you got to the mall. Yes, it is respectful to let the older person ride in front normally you would be NTA but not this time.", "sounding a lot like smothered.", "YTA. It\u2019s his car, his rules. But your rules are stupid anyways, why does an adult need to be in the front? It\u2019s better for couples to be beside each other in my opinion, so they can be together. You also say the same about his brother, which I don\u2019t get why family must be in the front. Bizarre rule in my opinion. \n\nThen you took away the keys to his car. It\u2019s his car\u2026 right? That must\u2019ve been the last straw as he stopped living with you since you don\u2019t respect him. Tell me, is taking someone\u2019s car keys from them for not letting you sit in the front a respectful thing to do, or should you graciously move to the back as they\u2019re being nice and driving you around. Seems like the car gift is conditional, he has to drive you around and the keys aren\u2019t his? \n\nWas he being dramatic? Maybe, depends on what other things you do to him. With your kind of attitude I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s already upset with the living arrangement and is glad you pushed him away.", "YTA - You turned this into a pissing contest in an extremely immature way, to receive respect you must first give respect; also as far as your age and status as mother goes, you should know better and comport yourself with dignity.", "YTA. This has to do with a lot more than \u2018respecting your elders\u2019. Pretty clear that you\u2019ve been pushing the buttons really, really hard, and you pressed one too many, bringing the entire apparatus down on your head.", "YTA. I don\u2019t care if they are teenagers, you are not entitled to the front seat because you are their parent. My in-laws do this and it pisses me off.", "I\u2019m going with Yta\u2014these are two different rules, both of which I recognize.  The adult sits up front rule vs the significant other of the driver sits up front.  Both are fine.  But I can see how someone used to one rule would be shocked by the other.  I think given their age, their jumping to the second is a little surprising.  I\u2019m saying op is an AH because the whole business of making someone move after the first person has already sat down is rude.  First person gets in; other person deals with it graciously.  Making a big deal of it is just rude whoever is doing it.", "YTA and what a hill to die on! It\u2019s his car, he\u2019s driving so he gets to choose who rides upfront. OP is rude and entitled \n\nI guess congrats to OP though for accidentally not raising a Mama\u2019s Boy since he has his the importance of his relationships sorted", "Gonna go with an E-S-H leaning more YTA. You have to realize that you won't always be the #1 woman in your son's life. BUT, if you were already seated, they shouldn't have kicked you out of the seat.\n\nBut I am wondering how you got home if they were your ride and left without you?\n\nEdit: OOF, based on your comments, changed to YTA. Your son is what..a few months away from being a legal adult? Cut the cord.", "YTA and don\u2019t be surprised to not hear from your son anymore. Seems like there\u2019s a lot of info missing on you being a pretty shit mom.", "YTA, your sons car, your sons rules, sit in the back while he has his girlfriend in the car with him, or drive your own car or alternatively catch the bus. I\u2019m sure you did not let him ride shotgun when you had your husband/partners in your car.", "LOL.  Your son's moving out when and all you had to do was call \"Shotgun!\"", "YTA", "YTA. Drive yourself.", "When my mom went with me and my partner somewhere she automatically got in the back and wouldn't move.\nYTA, and weirdly insistent about strange things.", "Holy shit, you tagged along on a date, making drop you off on an errand and you are pissed that they wanted you to sit in the back? \n\nYour son is 17, a year away from being an adult, and you are treating him like he's 12. You need to apologize to your son, or come to grips with the fact that you won't be speaking to him much in his adult life.\n\nYTA", "As someone who 1) can't sit in the backseat of cars due to motion sickness, and 2) has grandparents that LOVE riding in the backseat while us grandkids chauffeur them around -> YTA. It wasn't about disrespect toward you, it was about you winning a silly power play with your son in an attempt to disrespect him and his girlfriend. And I agree with the other commenters here: there's 100% more to this story that we don't know and this situation with the front seat was just your son's final straw.", "YTA - you\u2019re just trying to be controlling for no good reason and you just damaged your relationship with your son", "YTA. Yes, you are right in the sense that is is respectful to let elders sit in the front, but you behaved poorly, especially in Madeline\u2019s car. Like everyone else has said, I have no doubt there have been ongoing issues with you and your son for awhile.", "YTA. This whole post is kinda gross. You sound like your in competition with your sons girlfriend. I really hope you\u2019re not going to be one of those MIL\u2019s that expect their son to put you before his wife. I honestly feel like this is an episode of I\u2019m in love with a mama\u2019s boy, except this boy seems to understand to put his lady first.", "Yta. You actually tried to make her sit in the back in her own car? Lmao. There's no way this is the first thing that was an issue.  You seem very controlling.", "YTA for sure. What you viewed as disrespectful your son viewed as you being over bearing. For one, you offered to carpool with them in HIS car (of which you did not provide him). How can you be mad about seat arrangements when you knew how he did it?? Then calling him dramatic is the icing on the cake. He\u2019s simply fed up.\n\nYou wanting to assert your dominance over him led to this and I suspect this isn\u2019t a one off incident either \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fhe\u2019s within his rights to move in with dad & you shouldn\u2019t have taken his car keys", "You invited yourself on their date and then expected to get shotgun? YTA", "The last time I had an argument with someone over who got to sit in front I was probably 12. I'm 41 now, btw.", "YTA! Grow up. If David was older and married, would you make his wife sit in the back? You're acting like a jealous gf and that's pretty weird. Realize, you're his mother, not his gf and you won't be the only important female in his life. \n\nI'm siding with your ex. You had no right to take keys away from him. It wasn't yours to take away and if you had done that with anyone else, you bet the cops would have been called on you. Well of course your friends are going to agree with you. They're YOUR fiends!! \n\nYou don't have to worry about David disrespecting you anymore. He moved out and in with someone who respects him more than you do.", "I was brought up in a household where offering the front seat to an adult was expected of me, however you can\u2019t just presume that this will happen. That makes you very entitled. If it\u2019s not offered to you, especially when they\u2019re doing you a favour, then just get in the back. There is obviously much more to the relationship and story if he moved out over this.", "YTA, just say you wish you could date your own son babe. Why do you think you\u2019re entitled to sitting in the front of her car? You took keys for a car you didn\u2019t buy? Congrats on damaging your relationship with your son over your jealousy. Learn to drive.", "YTA. And I\u2019m a 29 year old man, not just a teenager screaming abuse.\n\nYour son is almost a legal adult, he is old enough to have his own rules regarding his property. Maybe it would be nice to let you sit in the front, but demanding it is the wrong way to go about it, especially in his girlfriends car when you have no right to parent her.\n\nYou are also at the point where you must earn respect, and cannot demand it. By demanding respect just by virtue of being a parent you are driving your kid away.

David has been dating Madeline (17) for 6 months now and whenever they go anywhere he insists that she sits in the front. I was always against this. If a parent or grandparent is in the car it's very disrespectful to make them sit in the back so a teenager can take the front seat. He makes his brother, Jason (15), move to the back all the time for Madeline even though Jason's family. \n\nDavid and Madeline were going out and I needed to run errands in that area so I decided to ride there with them and have them drop me off/pick me up since it was on the way. \n\nWe were going to the car and I got in the front seat. David told me to move to the back because Madeline always sits in the front but I refused because, like I said, I believe it's very disrespectful for an adult to have to sit in the back so a teenager can sit in the front. After a little back and forth, they got in Madeline's car. My son drove and Madeline got to the front seat before me and refused to move so I had to sit in the back. We got into another argument on the way there and I took his car keys as punishment. \n\nThey dropped me off at the mall and I did my returns, did some shopping, and got some food. David and Madeline were taking a lot longer than I expected so I called David and he didn't answer. 10 minutes later I got a call from Jason saying that David and Madeline were at the house and were loading David's stuff into her car. \n\nI got home a little over an hour later and David's room had been cleared out and his car was gone. He left a note saying that he's going to live with his dad because I don't respect him, which is complete bullshit. I got a call from my ex saying I needed to return the car keys by the end of the day or else he'd get the police involved. \n\nJason's saying I fucked up and should've just given Madeline the front seat but he also agrees that David's being dramatic. My friends agree that David and Madeline were both very rude but I wanted more opinions.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is pretty normal for him to want to seat next to his girlfriend, on his car,  in their way to a date.\n\nThinks that aren't normal:\n1. The hate/ jealousy you have for this girl\n2. The power play that you did trying to show that you are above the girlfriend \n3. Trying to be involved in their date on an attempt to downplay their love/time together \n4. Getting really angry and trying to punish your son when he didn't play along with the emotional incest\n5. Trying to dictate how long their date should be, calling your son when you felt it was to long\n\nThe easiest way to show how emotional incest can manifest is to think of a mother who has a teenage son who started dating.

Let me ask you this, frontseatpost, if you and your husband are driving mil around, do you ride in the back seat? Regardless of your answer, YTA. How\u2019s it feel knowing you ran your son out of the house? Happy?", "You're not describing manners, you're describing deference. You want respect while showing none.", "How would you know what manners are? You have none. You seem like the type of parent who thinks a child voicing an opinion is \u201ctalking back\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "dude you tagged along when they were going on a date, in a car you didn\u2019t buy, and probably didn\u2019t pay for the gas in considering you didnt want to waste your own gas, and you seriously think you\u2019re in the right just because you\u2019re OLDERRR wow", "You threw a tantrum over a car seat lmao", "You are the only brat.", "Or they're finally helping him pull away from his AH mother. He's got people who have his back now instead of some almighty judge banging her brat gavel. You aren't behaving as a very loving parent. Have you tried turning your feelings off and back on again? YTA.", "Who turned you into a brat?", "Or you're a control freak who f$@k around and found out.", "My in laws disagree. Up until rather recently my husband made me sit in the back for his grandmother or mom to sit in the front.\nHusband would say it's for respect. Then he claimed it was for ease due to her mobility issues.\nThis happened in any car we took, even mine. Even if I had been initially driving, if we picked her up he drove and I moved to the back.", "If one has difficulty navigating in and out of a vehicle it most certainly does. Did I mention entitled anywhere? Did I say I had to have it this way?\n\nMy son knows I have some arthritis flare-ups and pain and he respectfully gives me the easier option to get in and out of the car.", "Well now you don\u2019t have to worry about it because you pushed your own child away for petty reasons.", "His father respects him enough to not fight with his son over a seat in the car.", "Sounds like you\u2019re just not ready to accept that you are not your son\u2019s priority anymore with his girlfriend in the picture now. Drive yourself if you don\u2019t like the seating arrangement.", "You know, I hope you returned those keys. Because it doesn't sound like he let's people get away with their wrong nonsense behavior. And I am sure if your almost adult son did something that was worth alienating him because the alternative is worse, he would enforce those rules.\n\nYou didn't weigh action vs consequence very well here. Either that or you thought because you are the mom, you could ignore it for yourself. In your lesson of action vs consequence, did you ever think that at his age, over something so stupid as this, that he has more power? The car, while it's his, is likely in his dad's name because of his age. Which means you can't actually take it from him. And actions in his gf's car? I imagine her parents wouldn't have warned you before pressing charges if you tried taking her keys or kicking her out of her own vehicle.\n\nAnd, the biggest rule is that the owner of the vehicle has a RIGHT to be in the front seat, whether they are driving or not. If you threw this tantrum, I would have handed the GF the keys and said I was riding in the front of MY CAR while she drove. And then your claim of adult vs teen wouldn't have had a 2 inch leg to stand on.", "Well now, and in the years to come, when your son is married with kids, and you're still shut out of his life completely, you can pass the time by telling yourself that you were totally and definitely right, and that it was all worth it.", "You\u2019re a third wheel. You sit in the back. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers, didn\u2019t you get the memo, Mam?", "He is about to be an adult and you will lose all control of him, good luck having no son", "Is it unrealistic to expect an older person to be offered the front seat? Certainly not in my family. I think if anything the son\u2019s reaction to strand his mother and move house is the disproportionate reaction. Like I said, maybe there is a backstory we don\u2019t know about here but it sounds like based on these facts that the son values his lay above his family. I have zero respect for that.", "Thank you! I guess people aren\u2019t concerned anymore about how they look to their partner\u2019s parents and it\u2019s really odd to see OP get this amount of vitriol from strangers over it when I wouldn\u2019t *dare* be anything but obliging and respectful to my bf\u2019s parents. I\u2019ve always made sure that any complaint any friend or boyfriend\u2019s parents have had about me is that I\u2019m not around enough. \n\nCan\u2019t understand as a gf being more than happy to piss off my bf\u2019s mom like this. Weird.", "Why did you come here asking for an opinion if you\u2019re not going to read them and are only agreeing with people with your same pov?", "Omg. Call the police it's so terrible", "Lmao", "It\u2019s a seat why are you so mad get over yourself", "Jealous of a 17 year old girl. How embarrassing and sad for you.", "The courteous thing would have been for the girlfriend to offer the seat to someone older than her. In general, one would offer the front seat to someone pregnant, older or infirm. Manners are nice, but clearly everyone isn't interested in being nice.", "Yes. She needed to show the girlfriend that her son is a \u201cmommy\u2019s boy,\u201d and that she was the real first woman in his life.\nDidn't play well in reality, but I bet that in her head, planning to get along in a date with them... this power trip played in her favor.", "GF or son may have. We are only getting OPs side of the story, and she isn't going to say anything that would automatically make her look bad.", "Idk I'm old as well and have never noticed a difference between the backseat and front seat, in terms of getting in easier. My grandparents sat in the back a lot of times in their 70s and never complained. But again, I don't notice a difference so I never really care. \n\nSuper bizarre to choose this hill to die on though.", "Where I\u2019m from if the car is going to be full/almost full and there are no mitigating circumstances it is rude to not give the front seat to the oldest person. It\u2019s like giving up your seat for the elderly on the bus. It\u2019s not a hard and fast rule but it is a common curtesy. However, if the car is not almost full (ie only one person in the backseat) then it\u2019s common that the person who knows the driver best sits shotgun. Aka OP is TA but I can see where she is coming from that it\u2019s not \u201crespecting your elders\u201d. Mostly I think she\u2019s upset her son seems to care more about his gf then her.", "She says it's an issue of age/respect. However, when he makes his younger brother sit in the back, it's wrong because his brother is family. She states she hates his girlfriend. \n\nIt's jealousy and a power move. You don't invite yourself on someone else's date.", "i\u2019m referring to the girlfriend as the poor teenager. she has no obligations to OP if OP already doesn\u2019t like her. \n\nwhen kids are teenagers that\u2019s when co parenting dies off because the parents don\u2019t need to be in constant contact anymore, especially if they aren\u2019t on good terms to start with. if he\u2019s 16 and drives he clearly doesn\u2019t need them to co parent anymore. if you\u2019re a child of divorce this is quite easy to understand. and you have no idea messy divorces can be, she has no right to make her own rules about a car she didn\u2019t buy, especially over seating arrangements. it\u2019s such a privileged problem to have, deciding that not getting the front seat is the end of the world. what about her damaged relationship with her son? she\u2019s worried about respect and not about how detached he is from her because of her demands. this can\u2019t be the only conflict.\n\nthe only thing i\u2019ll agree with you on is if she was already sitting in the seat i probably would\u2019ve just sucked it up. this is not worth making a big deal over. but if OP knew that the son reserved the front seat for his girlfriend she was asking for more conflict. she prioritized respect over her relationship with her son.", "Ok... but it doesn't mean it's right. Doesn't mean they need to follow it. Them not following doesn't make the AHs or disrespectful", "So here the thing about \u201cearned\u201d respect. Yes, as a parent it\u2019s her job for her to provide for her son. But is that act not worthy of respect? IMO, unless OP\u2019s relationship with her son is terrible due to abuse on her end, she has already done enough to deserve the basic level. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have tagged along. But if the son had a problem with it, he could\u2019ve \u201crespectfully\u201d told his mom he would prefer if she didn\u2019t come along. Doesn\u2019t seem like he did. To be fair, OP\u2019s comment don\u2019t seem like she\u2019s an easy person to talk to. But none of the parties acted respectfully. Madeline didn\u2019t either.", "Because she genuinely thought we all did this nonsense. As if rational adults third wheel on their kids dates and cry about not getting shotty. Smh", "She chose to have a child. Raising him is literally the bare minimum she can do. He did not ask to be born. Like I said, respect is earned.", "That's just a dumb cultural thing, car seating chart etiquette", "She chose to have a kid. She chose to take on those obligations.  Fulfilling thr obligations she took on voluntarily does not entitle her to control her kids actions forever. \n\nHow does the fact that OP is his mother entitle her to always sit in the front row?", "What\u2019s different about getting in the front seat or getting in the back seat? They\u2019re the same level", "Sure if they offered it then it could've been fine. But mum invited herself along and then threw a tantrum.\n\nEdit: respect is earned by our actions, not our demands.", "Yes, it can be courteous to offer someone older than you the front seat, or something else. However, just because they are older does not mean they are entitled to it.\n\nShe was on a date with her boyfriend, why should she sit in the backseat while he was doing his mom a favour of dropping her off somewhere because she didn\u2019t want to spend her own gas money to go there. \nThe mom was being entitled and I don\u2019t blame the girlfriend for not offering up the front seat", "Nope. Why should you being alive longer dictate where you sit in a car?", "Elders don't deserve respect just because they're old.", "What if the person in the back will puke because they have to sit in the back seat.", "Yawn. There is nothing here to indicate that OP has been sitting in the back while GF refused to be polite and offer the front. OP clearly argues and demands the front constantly. Of course no one offers kindness at this point.", "I\u2019m going to be completely honest\u2026 \n\nAny partner of my children in their adolescence that behaves in similar fashion of this girl would get a side eye from me as well. Downvote me to hell, I do not care. \n\nSon not wanting his mom to have the front seat is one issue. Girlfriend stepping in the middle of the dispute is a whole other issue, and indicative of the bigger problem IMO.", "An argument can be made that the son prioritized his girlfriend over OP so there\u2019s that. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t agree about the divorce. That may be your experience but that\u2019s not everyone\u2019s. Driving doesn\u2019t make a difference when I grew up, if I was in trouble at mom\u2019s house, I was in trouble at dad\u2019s. If dad bought something, mom still had control over it because it keeps the kids from doing exactly what OP\u2019s son did and provides structure. By having different rules on *anything* it allows for things to slip through the cracks. \n\nAnd I honestly doubt he\u2019s \u201cdetached.\u201d He\u2019s a teenager who has a girlfriend. He\u2019s just thinking with the wrong head probably.", "Just because you don\u2019t find something disrespectful doesn\u2019t mean others aren\u2019t allowed to..?", "[deleted]", "Because it\u2019s more comfortable and sitting in a backseat with three people is a tight fit. Usually some jostling happens over a 30 minute car ride (which is about average for getting anywhere around me) and I personally feel a lot less bad accidentally bumping my brother than my 80+ yr old grandparents. Like I said if the car isn\u2019t full it isn\u2019t as big a deal I can just appreciate what might be contributing to her thinking.", "Fair I meant more it\u2019s a courtesy that OP has interpreted as lack of respect and I can see where she is coming from but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t deserve it.", "That would fall under a mitigating circumstance.", "That\u2019s a valid point. I was just trying to explain that seating privilege = respect is maybe old fashioned but not completely out of left field and is still reasonable in some circumstances (as stated not this circumstance since OP is TA)", "Not when it's an irrational feeling. She needs to look at herself before blaming them.", "Wouldn't it be more polite for hee to sit in the back. She joined them. She's a third wheel. She's the entitled brat.", "She was already sitting in the front and her son just orders her to move to the back like she\u2019s a child? Wouldn\u2019t call being upset at being disrespected like that irrational", "She joined them, they were going on a date. That's rude and disrespectful, get your ass in the back.", "Jesus", "Who Dat?"]}
