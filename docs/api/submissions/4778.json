Your mother is free to not attend,  but she's not free to dictate your guest list.", "NTA. Your brother has no love for you and your budget is limited. Your mother is emotionally blackmailing you by trying to make you responsible for her relationship with her son, that is not fair. If I were in your position, I'd tell her \"I appreciate you have your son's back, but as you feel that I'll cause problems for you in your relationship with him,  I'll respect your decision if you don't want to come. I'm not inviting him, because he has no love for me, and I want to be surrounded by people who love and care for me, and that is, unfortunately, not your son, despite the efforts I have made.\" That will put the ball in your court. I appreciate you'd feel uncomfortable doing that, but she is out of line gaslighting you like that.", "NTA. Tell her she doesn't have to come either if she doesn't drop it.", "NTA.\n\nas usual, your wedding, your rules, your guest list. the only person you have to listen to is your soon-to-be hubby.\n\nanybody else who wants a say in it has to pay up. \n\n'hi mom, i invited brother as you demanded. sadly due to budget restraints i needed to uninvite someone and surprise, it has to be you.'\n\nproblem solved.\n\nand yes, i am a proud member of the petty a-jole club.", "NTA tell her that if she doesn\u2019t drop it she\u2019ll find herself uninvited therefore her relationship with your brother will be safe", "It\u2019s your wedding. Period. NTA.", "NTA. Let your mom invite him to her next wedding. Your wedding. Your guest list.", "NTA And if he wanted to be at your wedding he would be involved in your life.\n\nThe relationship between your mom and brother are not your concern.", "NTA despite the fact he is your family but it is your decision what to invite and what not :)\n\n if he is more like stranger than family your decision is correct", "NTA. Nope. If he has no relationship with you, he doesn't get to be there. Tell her that she can just not come if her relationship with him is more important.", "NTA. It's not worth the hassle. He himself says he has no relationship to you so why is your mom pushing this so hard? Your strategy of not entertaining the discussion when she tries to have it is a good one but you may want to start physically walking away when she brings it up if it's possible for you to do so.", "NTA.  Tell her the fact she\u2019s convinced he\u2019s going to punish *her* for a decision *you* made that she has no control over should tell her why you\u2019re not interested in accommodating him.  Or just go with the \u201cif you bring this up again, I\u2019m going to take that to mean you\u2019re not coming, either\u201d strategy, because you really don\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t have to keep arguing this.", "NTA. Not in any way.", "NTA.  Not really much to say, it's your wedding.  You are restricted to 5 guests each.  You don't really have a relationship with your brother.  Why would you invite him...", "NTA you don\u2019t have a relationship with him anyway, so why does it matter?", "NTA\u2014is it her wedding or yours?? I think she\u2019s forgotten that she\u2019s a guest and she ultimately doesn\u2019t get to call the shots. If she wants to let this ruin her relationship with you that sounds to me like a her issue and not a you issue.", "NTA - if you weren\u2019t restricted to such a small number of guests I would say to suck it up for the sake of keeping peace in your family but in your situation you have the absolute right to have people with you who genuinely love and care for you and make a positive impact in your life.", "NTA\n\nYour budget is set.  You don't have room for one more.  That's it.\n\nIf you can, put this back on her.  Like ask her to cover the extra cost to invite him (if it's a money issue, not a space issue.  If she says no, then it's her fault he can't go.  She can't keep harassing you if she won't cover the costs.  You can easily counter any argument she brings with the fact that she won't/can't cover the cost so he can't go.", "NTA. You\u2019ve invited guests to you wedding that actually care. Don\u2019t cave to manipulative tactics. Good luck OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
