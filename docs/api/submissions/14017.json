I live about three hours away from her. Normally I drive there on Saturday morning, stay the night and leave after an Easter Sunday brunch.\n\nMy brother, who lives in Atlanta, is coming to see her - as are his two sons who are in their 20's. One of his sons, my nephew, is married (he got married last June) and the other nephew is single. It's a big deal for all of us to see her, since Pittsburgh isn't really near any of our homes - he has to fly in and so are his children. My mother has a four bedroom home, and it has her room, two rooms with queen beds and 1 room with a twin. There's is also a finished basement, but it doesn't have sleeping arrangements (a non-pull out couch) but does have an air mattress.\n\nMy brother told me:\n\n1. My 26 year old son is married now. He's going to take the bedroom you normally sleep in with the queen with his wife.\n2. You can share the twin bed room with my other 23 year old son (he's my nephew).\n3. I'm taking the other queen bedroom with my wife.\n\nI told him that, honestly, I didn't want to do this. He was upset. He didn't understand why i'm making a big deal. Told him i'm 50 years old. I always slept in the same queen bed for years. His son got married last year and now it's some kind of change because they are married and i'm single? In years past, his kids would sleep in the twin beds.\n\nI'm not sure if other single people have felt this way, but its like you are on the lower rank of the totem pole if you aren't married? For years and years (in my teens, 20's and even 30's) I was always the guy sleeping on couches or air mattresses for others because I was the single guy.\n\nI'm the uncle now. I certainly can armchair psychologist this one and call it ego or hubris but i'm not sleeping in a room with my nephew. I snore like a freight train and do not sleep well with others - noises put me off, I sleep with a white noise machine. I have been sleeping alone for 30 years as a single guy.\n\nHe's not understanding this and saying i'm being selfish. I am explaining back that i'm the uncle here, and i'm no longer his 18 year old kid brother that is subjected to sleeping like this. His son and daughter-in-law can sleep in twin beds - and his 23 year old son can use the air mattress in the basement.\n\nI can see both perspectives here. I think there's something to be said about being the older uncle and treated with a bit more respect and not maligned because i'm single and not married.\n\nEdited to add (and causing some confusion): The bedroom with twin beds has TWO twin beds.

Perhaps my upbringing was \"toxic\" or \"problematic\" but under no circumstance outside of pregnancy would an uncle be sleeping in a twin bed from his youth while two 20 somethings sleep on a queen bed...and why do they get it? Because they obtained a license to bump uglies!?!? \n\nYes, you are being penalized and demoted for being single. When people say, \"but there's only one of you\", I don't think they realize they are saying that you alone are not enough to be considered a respected elder adult in the family. But if you have a spouse...yay, queen bed no questions asked. \n\nAlso, as a fellow old man with sleep sensitivity/anxiety and an old man's back, I totally sympathize. I say lead by example for the younger, single nephew and get a hotel room. Show him that neither of you are less than. Show all of them that alone doesn't mean sad, lonely and willing to be stowed away with the kids. Will your brother be requiring you to sit at the kids' table during Thanksgiving? I think not.

And that way, no one has to sleep on an air mattress. The 23 yr old nephew is not a child, and he doesn\u2019t want to sleep on an air mattress any more than you do. \n\nNow, I understand why this doesn\u2019t appeal to you.

That makes perfect sense to me.", "I think YTA... but I need some clarification. First of all, I'm a bit confused because it sounds like you're saying there are two separate rooms with queen beds and a third room with one twin. So you're meant to share a twin?\n\nAt the end of the day, if there are two twin mattresses in the last room, it absolutely makes sense for married couples to partner up and take the queen bed rooms while two single individuals would take smaller bed arrangements.

A queen bed is smaller than two twin beds so big bro and his wife actually have less real estate by agreeing to share the queen bed than they would if they got the two twins.  I guess if OP wants to share the queen with the unmarried nephew that would also be fair, but somehow I don\u2019t see him suggesting that.", "NTA and anyone who says otherwise is wrong. \n\nFor 25 years, this is where you stay. In that room. In your spare bed. A safe place for you. Your brother gets his room. Your brother procreated and then needs to make accommodations for HIS kids. Not put you out because one of his kids is married. \n\nFull stop. \n\nAs a parent, I AM SOLELY responsible for making sure my family has accommodations. I am not ENTITLED to anyone else\u2019s space because I have KIDS. I am NOT welcome and should not feel entitled to anyone\u2019s space without permission. It was MY choice to procreate and that is not something anyone else is responsible for. Me telling someone that they are lesser because they don\u2019t have a partner is also not my judgment to make. Im only in charge of my actions and how my actions affect others. \n\nIf HIS kids need more room, he can go to Walmart and buy another air mattress big enough for two people. It is much cheaper than a hotel room. He can return it the next day with a receipt. The end of story. \n\nYour brother is a giant as$hole. He owes you an apology. And if you don\u2019t get one, take his room. He can figure it out.", "After reading some replies i change to YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou're one person--you don't need a queen all to yourself.\n\nTwo people who will share a bed should, rightfully, get the bigger bed. That's just common sense.", "NTA", "I think YTA\n\nYou don't understand why you can't have the same arrangement as when they were children? You're one adult--you don't need a queen bed, but he has a partner so he does. \n\nAlso not your house so while expressing a polite opinion is okay pushing to \"keep my room\" (not yours) is too far.", "YTA. this is truly very basic math. there are 6 visiting adults and 6 sleeping spots available in real beds. you, inexplicably, are adamant that you are entitled to 2 of those spots for yourself just because you happened to be assigned the \"spare\" when only 5 spots were needed", " \u201cI\u2019m not sure if other single people have felt this way, but it\u2019s like you are on the lower rank of the totem pole.\u201d \n\nIf you\u2019re using a significant cultural reference i.e. totem pole at least use the term correctly. The low man on the totem pole is the most powerful. This figure holds up the other figures and it is closer to the earth.

Ok so you don\u2019t want to sleep in the same room as your nephew. Are you going to plan some other accomodation? Or if you don\u2019t get that room that you want will you just not go? I don\u2019t really want to label anyone as the asshole in the situation. But I think you might be reading into this wrong because you think that you\u2019re a lower priority because you\u2019re not in a relationship but really it seems like what\u2019s the best logistical way we could handle this situation with the amount of rooms and beds that we have.\n\nWhat would your ideal outcome be? You get the room that you want, is there enough rooms and beds for everyone including space for the couples?", "NTA, though you're lucky they offered you a bed in a room. My single ass gets offered the sofa or an inflatable mattress in a common area.", "NTA\n\nBut why not move one of the twin beds to the basement? \n\nSurely between the four you, it would be the easiest solution?", "NTA, you shouldn't have to share with a Nephew and from a purely practical reason of you needing to use a white noise machine and being a heavy snorer.  \n\nAsk him if he hates his son enough to ruin his sleep for the trip.\n\nMight be worth seeing a doctor about that sleep apnea thou.", "> He owes you an apology.\n\nAt the end, after explaining how I felt about it, he did relent. I just felt like I was being disrespected because a) I am the uncle in this situation and b) its a room that I literally would use for 25 years going back to see my mother and suddenly his kid is married and now \"they should use that room, not you\". I felt that was disrespectful.   \n\n\nThank you for the feedback.", "Hm.. it\u2019s only for one night I don\u2019t think it should be something that could cause an issue with your family.

You\u2019ve been sleeping in a certain room and certain bed for a long time\u2026 and you\u2019re probably a creature of habit. You feel displaced by a younger family member and it feels like you\u2019re not as important because you\u2019re single. All this is true. But\u2026 families change. Trust me, I know personally how shifting family roles and situations changes things. And it hurts. As you said, you did your time and now believe you deserve the big bed. It may have been really hard for your brother to have this conversation with you and mom just wants to stay out it, because they knew you\u2019d be upset.  You keep repeating this idea of elder respect. Dude, some of the worst things that ever happened to me were done by my elders. Again, respect is earned not demanded. You can be a team player and appreciated by those around you by being flexible and gracious (while acknowledging your married nephews new family member -wife) and sleep in the twin\u2026 or you can be \u201cright\u201d. Your pick.", "Or get there first and set up in the room you want.  Of course I\u2019m petty like that.\n\nEdit:  NTA", "So if you disliked being treated as such by your brother because of age, can you see how your attitude about it might read off to the rest of your family?", "Dude, don't you think your making  lot of drama over 1 night? I get the feeling your extended don't get together like this very often, also once in 25 years you been asked to move? Really sounds like you would be far happier in a nearby hotel. You sound a lot like my dad, a creature of habit, maybe take a deep breath it probably won't be as bad as you think it will be.", "I just think growing up I was taught to respect my uncles and aunts when they would visit. I was thinking I deserved the same respect, too.", "Not to be mean here, but did aunts and uncles have kids?  From my understanding of families that have those \u201crespect your elders\u201d attitude, typically those elders are parents/grandparents.

I\u2019m also single, but perhaps it\u2019s family dynamics that makes this idea of you taking a whole queen bed for yourself seem very selfish to me. Your way involves at least one person to sleep in lesser accommodations, and you don\u2019t think it should be you because of what you were subjected to when you were younger. You think you paid your dues so you\u2019re passing on this shitty family idea that young people have to suck it up, regardless of the fact that their arrangement gives a proper bed to everyone. I\u2019d have no issues making due with a twin bed for a night. I think you\u2019re taking this way too personally and you should consider lodging elsewhere if the rest of the family disagrees with your perspective.", "NTA. He should\u2019ve asked, not demanded.

Why doesn't your brother and his wife give up their usual spot? Oh, because it's always been the room they use when visiting. This voluntold crap certainly won't fly with a 50 year old man anymore. Definitely NTA. If they don't like the arrangements which have been in use for years then they can get a hotel room.", "NTA. Your brothers expanding family is HIS responsibility, not yours & shouldn\u2019t require you sacrificing. There\u2019s a very simple solution to this issue:    brother can purchase a bigger bed & replace the twin size beds. Problem solved.", "NTA. If I was the brother in this situation, I would have asked about sleeping arangements not dictated it to you. What he did is such a rude way to go about organizing who sleeps where and deeply disrespectful to you.", "NTA. Move one of the twin beds to the basement and move your nephew there. You don\u2019t get a queen bed, but a twin bed is plenty big enough for 1 person.", "YTA. This is not some kind of weird \u201canti single\u201d behavior/stance on their part, nor is it a disrespect thing. It\u2019s literally just the fact that couples like sleeping together. It\u2019s not deeper than that.", "I wonder if the 50- something\u2019s could offer to buy and install a queen bed in place of the twins in their mom\u2019s house? And if there\u2019s space, move one or both twins to the basement and let the air out of the air mattress? Even better if the new Queen bed is better for Uncle\u2019s back.", "NTA  \nSeems to me you have only one option. Buy a couple of cheap pawn shop rings, get a cheap hooker for the night, print a marriage certificate online. Show up early and loudly announce that you have since gotten married and are claiming the queen bed as your sovereign territory. And since you've already paid for it, might as well go copulate on it with the door open to assert dominance.", "Nta.  Your used to sleeping in you own room, alone.  Your brother doesn\u2019t understand how drastically different it would be for you to share a room.  The young married couple can sleep on the air mattress or share the twin room.", "Great comment!!", "Right\u2026 Except it is a respect scenario. His brother didn\u2019t ask, he just told him what to do. Seems to me like he hasn\u2019t notice OP is a full grown adult with needs whose opinion is of importance", "Yep, just common sense. Worst case, they can move one of the twin mattresses to the basement for nephew to sleep on. Everyone gets a room. Everyone gets a bed. It\u2019s not rocket surgery.", "It's amazing how the brother never volunteered his own room but OP's room for the couple. If this is so important to the brother and his new in-law how about they get a hotel room for the night or offer to pay for a room for this man. This is the room he has used on visits for over 2 decades now but suddenly him and only him needs to make a sacrifice for his brother's son and new wife? That's the issue. Between the 2 couples they can hopefully afford a room for the elder couple or OP for 1 night. That's no asking too much since it is his son that got married.", "I think you should decide what you want to do and what you aren't 0willing to do and propose that to your mother. If she says no, get a hotel room.", "But you are only thinking about your own feelings. You are an insider. Try for a moment to think about how the in-laws feel too. They will want to sleep with their significant others and will already feel like outsiders, and just a moment to themselves will be huge. Your mom already adores you. Just take a step back and put yourself in the shoes of the outsider.", "I mean, you seem pretty unpleasant in general. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be feeling all that accommodating towards you.", "Is there a reason why your nephew can\u2019t sleep on the air mattress? Otherwise, can you move one of the mattresses from the twin room to the basement for nephew to sleep on? That way, everyone gets a room and a bed.", "As I\u2019ve said elsewhere, I don\u2019t find it disrespectful to try to put every adult in a bed, even if it means that not everyone gets their preferred spots", "I agree with this one married brother with wife and 3 accompanying guests should be the one to book a room if one is needed his party needs more room. Therefore, one of them should take the financial hit of needed. \n\nAlternately married brother and OP get their queens as it's already precedence and they are older. Married young couple get the room with 2 twins and can push them together if needed. Single stone takes air matress in living room or basement.", "Sure, but still wouldn\u2019t hurt to politely ask and explain the situation rather than just demanding to give up the bed", "It\u2019s not always what you say, it\u2019s the way you say it", "Respect your elders and married couples always got first priority\u2026.. those two statements contradict each other.\n\nBeing \u201cmad southern\u201d also means a lot of not nice outdated traditions expectations and stereotypes in both sides so it\u2019s not the flex you think it is", "So your solution is that the older unmarried person should either be in discomfort or spend more money to accommodate those that are coupled and decades younger?
