But. This will be unpopular to say but I say it as a reader and book lover. Your books aren\u2019t worth that. I can\u2019t get anything for first or second editions, beautiful books I have treasured for decades. Your middle-school books have little real value, I gently suggest that you can gauge the truth of this by thinking about whether you yourself want them now even though you loved them once - and you don\u2019t. I would also have declined your original price which was designed to make a profit and was beyond what I would have paid for used books. The family discount price was all right but not exceptional, and your aunt is within her rights to decide whether to buy what you have on offer, or not. She is clearly going another way on this now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If she was only asking for like 2-3 books, I might consider it differently, because then it would be a small ask that would be much more reasonable.\n\nFWIW, as a fellow bibliophile, you\u2019re not likely to get anywhere near what you\u2019re asking for anything that isn\u2019t a current bestseller or especially desirable - I just donated a stack of books because despite the fact that many of my books are in great condition like yours, I\u2019d only get maybe a dollar or two for hardcovers and $.50-$1 for softcovers selling them, and I\u2019m at a point in my life where finding buyers and packing them up would be more bother than the $40-$50 I expect it would\u2019ve netted.", "NTA but I'm confused\n\n>  I wanted to **make actual profit** off my books\n\n>  pricing them at $5 for hardcovers $3 for paperback.\n\n> I gave her a \u2018family discount\u2019, taking $2 off each book\n\nIf you were willing to sell these books for $3-1 a piece with that discount, **how _cheap_ were they in the first place** that you can still make a *PROFIT* by doing this?", "NTA.

There is no way she could find those same books brand new for a similar price.\nIt would be different if it was only maybe 1 or 2 books, then yeah, let them go for family peace.", "def NTA. Sounds like your aunt just wants to mooch some freebies off you with the excuse that you guys are related. At the end of the day, they are your books and they are worth a lot of money, so it\u2019s only fair if you get the money you deserve. Tell aunt that If she wants free books, get them from somewhere else", "SHE should be charitable to family, and pay you extra for your college fund.\n\nNTA.", "Exactly, if she wants cheap library cards ate free.", "That was my thought, too - if OP looked up what these titles would cost online if purchased secondhand, I'm guessing it's less than a dollar per book. You're free to charge whatever you want, but if you can share 50 of your favorite books with your cousin, free up some shelf space, and get $20 out of the deal, that seems like the best deal you can hope for here.", "You own first editions? When I make the big bucks that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to start collecting. I also want to get books in their original languages.

I mean, I don\u2019t think you could blame someone for not wanting to give up the proceeds of 50 books, but if she\u2019s not really going to get that, then maybe she is the AH for refusing to negotiate.", "The assumption OP is making a profit is misplaced.", "Its not profit, it's just extra money. Like selling old clothes, you don't make profit but you make money on things you don't want so it feels like profit.", "Some firsts, a few more seconds, several special editions over 100 years old. I love them and wouldn\u2019t ever sell, but I checked eBay and it isn\u2018t worth it. Better to keep and enjoy them!", "If OP already understood what she could actually sell the books for, I\u2019d probably agree, but she\u2019s young and inexperienced.  As bibliophiles we tend to overestimate the financial value of our used books until we learn otherwise.  It\u2019s understandable to expect them to hold more value than they do when you haven\u2019t damaged them.  Best deal I ever found was a used book store that gave me 1/4 the cover price\u2026but only in store credit.  They then sold books for 1/2 the cover price.  So I could trade 2 novels I\u2019d read for 1 novel I hadn\u2019t."]}
