{"id": 2449, "submission_id": "ywr9c1", "title": "AITA for how I responded to SIL's list of christmas rules?", "selftext": "I (36F) have an SIL, Karen (38F). Karen has a 10yo daughter, from her previous relationship. I have a daughter (8F).\n\nThe background to this is that Karen has always been weird about gifts. The first Christmas she spent with my family, my parents bought she and my brother a coffee maker; she cried over the fact that it was a joint gift and not one for her individually. They bought her daughter a stuffed animal; she complained because it wasn't as nice or as expensive as what they bought my daughter. This has continued every Christmas since. Every year on her or her daughter's birthday, some side remark is made that whatever we got is never big or expensive enough, and she makes comparisons to what we buy each other. Every year on my brother's birthday she spends the whole party/dinner making comments about how no one goes to that much effort with her birthday.\n\nThis year, me and my husband will be hosting Christmas. We will be flying the whole family out to stay with us and covering accommodation costs. They will be staying until after New Year's.\n\nOn Monday, I received a long email from Karen, titled Christmas Rules for Our Family. My other siblings and parents were cc'd. The rules were as follows:\n\n\\- Her daughter must receive the same number of gifts as my daughter, to a reasonably equitable monetary value\n\n\\- She must receive roughly the same number of presents as me and my siblings (basically around 3 from our parents, and one from each sibling), comparable in value\n\n\\- Any presents over \u00a350 for my daughter from me and my husband must not be gifted to her in front of SIL's daughter\n\n\\- Any gifts from those not attending Christmas (other sets of in-laws or grandparents) must not be given until after the holiday is over\n\nI was furious. I managed to rein myself in enough to ask my brother what Karen was playing at, dictating rules for my house, and he said she'd been seeing a counsellor, who was encouraging her to 'set boundaries and expectations' to avoid hurt feelings, and that he was standing by her in this. I said she is not welcome to make imperious demands and policies at an event where she is a guest, at someone else's expense, no less. I have always tried not to be gauche with giving my daughter extravagant gifts in front of everyone else, but I'm not postponing her Christmas till January because of Karen's whims. I went back on the email chain and said much the same thing. My brother says this means Karen might kick up a fuss about even coming for Christmas, which I'm sorry about but I don't think we should all be held to ransom over her entitlement. My mother and other brother agrees with what I said, but my father said maybe we should have tried to negotiate with Karen so they would still come to Christmas. So, AITA?\n\nPS. I should point that no one else's SOs have issues with the way my family gives gifts, so I'm really inclined to believe Karen is just entitled.\n\nedited a word", "created_utc": 1668599222, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywr9c1/aita_for_how_i_responded_to_sils_list_of/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not all of them are blood related, but I love them all. They don't get crap gifts, and I always put thought into them. But I'm not rich and my kids definitely get better gifts. They do the same when it comes to my kids. It's freaking normal. Now as far as the grandparents, if they're showing favorites that's wrong.
