Karen has a 10yo daughter, from her previous relationship. I have a daughter (8F).\n\nThe background to this is that Karen has always been weird about gifts. The first Christmas she spent with my family, my parents bought she and my brother a coffee maker; she cried over the fact that it was a joint gift and not one for her individually. They bought her daughter a stuffed animal; she complained because it wasn't as nice or as expensive as what they bought my daughter. This has continued every Christmas since. Every year on her or her daughter's birthday, some side remark is made that whatever we got is never big or expensive enough, and she makes comparisons to what we buy each other. Every year on my brother's birthday she spends the whole party/dinner making comments about how no one goes to that much effort with her birthday.\n\nThis year, me and my husband will be hosting Christmas. We will be flying the whole family out to stay with us and covering accommodation costs. They will be staying until after New Year's.\n\nOn Monday, I received a long email from Karen, titled Christmas Rules for Our Family. My other siblings and parents were cc'd. The rules were as follows:\n\n\\- Her daughter must receive the same number of gifts as my daughter, to a reasonably equitable monetary value\n\n\\- She must receive roughly the same number of presents as me and my siblings (basically around 3 from our parents, and one from each sibling), comparable in value\n\n\\- Any presents over \u00a350 for my daughter from me and my husband must not be gifted to her in front of SIL's daughter\n\n\\- Any gifts from those not attending Christmas (other sets of in-laws or grandparents) must not be given until after the holiday is over\n\nI was furious. I managed to rein myself in enough to ask my brother what Karen was playing at, dictating rules for my house, and he said she'd been seeing a counsellor, who was encouraging her to 'set boundaries and expectations' to avoid hurt feelings, and that he was standing by her in this. I said she is not welcome to make imperious demands and policies at an event where she is a guest, at someone else's expense, no less. I have always tried not to be gauche with giving my daughter extravagant gifts in front of everyone else, but I'm not postponing her Christmas till January because of Karen's whims. I went back on the email chain and said much the same thing. My brother says this means Karen might kick up a fuss about even coming for Christmas, which I'm sorry about but I don't think we should all be held to ransom over her entitlement. My mother and other brother agrees with what I said, but my father said maybe we should have tried to negotiate with Karen so they would still come to Christmas. So, AITA?\n\nPS.

In previous years has there been a clear hierarchy of presents? With Karens daughter having to spend Christmas possibly feeling neglected, unwelcome and unwanted after watching everyone else open so much more stuff? Because as a parent yourself, I'm sure you could understand not wanting your child to be made to feel like that at Christmas by your boyfriends family. Especially if the relationship is serious.\n\nIt might be worth having a conversation with your brother. Karen needs to stop with the spoilt and entitled behaviour when it comes to herself & that needs to be called out ASAP. That email wasn't a good way to communicate this.

If your parents ultimately wish to spend more they can give cash at a later point. Its sad that shes so focused on the monetary aspect of the holiday, but thats her choice.

But it sounds like she has been a part of the family for years, meaning her child has been part of the family since she was a little girl. She might not be your favorite, but treating them like outsiders hurts.\n\nI was that her daughter from 6-18 years old. We moved from the US to Canada when my mother got martied. My maternal grandparents had passed away and my paternal ones were not involved. This was my family. But they always treated me differently. At holidays, I would get an envelope with $20 while my cousins, same age and gender as me, got electronics and well thought out gifts for their tastes. I was grateful for the money, but it hurt to see 'our' grandparents didn't even think to get a gift card for my interests. I would watch my couskns unwrapping presents from all the aunts and uncles and grandparents. I would slowly open my single envelope to make it last and feel included. One year they forgot me beforehand, and I got a part of a Crabtree & Evelyn gift basket. Not the whole thing. One bottle. The rest was sitting in the bathroom, with the plastic torn open and one bottle removed. They would invite the other girls on shipping trips in front of me, and obviously exclude me. I felt so unloved and unwanted. Holidays sucked. Birthdays they insisted on a shared party in February for me and the grandfather since we were about a week apart. And the cake was always a flavor I was allergic to. No gifts, none of my own friends, and sometimes my name wasn't even on the cake. Birthdays sucked. I want to be clear it was not due to a lack of funds either. They were actually extremely wealthy, no word of a joke. They owned a private island and everything. \n\nYour SIL is probably seeing that the style of gift giving your family is displaying is making them feel the same way, even if the disparity isn't as extreme. She is trying to keep her child from hurting. She is going about it the wrong way. And her behavior isn't helping endear herself, unfortunately.  You aren't wrong to set your own boundaries sbd feel insulted as a host. But how often does your family show this child that she is not family she's the daughter of the wife if family. And why do you draw those lines for a little girl? If your brother loves her and treats her as his child, why can't you?", "Yep. I think she heard what she wanted to hear from that counselor. \"Setting boundaries\" is not the same as dictating what others can do in their own home at an event they are paying for.

Wishing you and yours a wonderful holiday.  \nCheers,  \nOP\"", "Does anyone else think that SIL wasn\u2019t telling the therapist the whole story, seeing a quack, OR is twisting the therapist\u2019s words?  Because I can\u2019t see a qualified licensed therapist say something and this is the result. Yeah, at this point, I would tell the SIL AND brother to throw these rules out of the window or they can do their own thing.\n\nUnless you guys are swimming in money, AND feel inclined, why would you spend the same amount on your kid as her\u2019s?  And the whole wanting a extravagant party for her birthday, she needs to take that up with her husband and not rest of the family.  And while it\u2019s nice to receive gifts as adults, Christmas isn\u2019t about gifts, ESPECIALLY gifts for fully grown adults. If she can\u2019t understand that\u2026\n\nFull disclosure, other than the kids, my family don\u2019t do gifts for adults.  My husband and I do not gift each other anything\u2026not officially anyways.", "Yes ! Exactly that. Absolutely NTA. Also boundaries is for yourself, you cannot force people to act a certain way. An example of boundaries: i will not hug you even if you gave me a nice gift, don't be offended.\nHer rules are not boundaries wtf", "THIS exactly. I think SIL needs to head back to therapist and ask them what they think of her list of rules for someone hosting her for several weeks. SMH....She needs help.", "The toothpick was always my favorite.", "This! It really makes me wonder what the woman has told her therapist about OP and the rest of the family, and exactly what the therapist knows about SIL's list. I can't imagine any therapist thinking setting such ridiculous \"boundaries\" was a good thing. My family often did Xmas at my aunt's or uncle's houses and it was expected that the host's kiddos received more presents bc they were at home, where everything is shipped from extended family and friends. If we were travelling then Xmas was somewhat split between Xmas day and whatever day we arrived home. OP's SIL needs to rein in her \"expectations\" or do everyone a favor and stay home.", "I think her therapist didn't explain \"boundaries\" properly, because these \"rules\" are NOT boundaries. Boundaries apply to oneself. Interactions amongst others are not \"boundaries\".", "Haha this isn't even on the petty scale for me.

But that first Christmas, my parents had met Karen's daughter once prior, and she and my brother had not been together that long. In the years since I think Christmas gifts have been roughly comparable.\n\nWhether I succeed would depend on your definition of gauche I suppose. Do I stick to some sort of price limit? No. Do I bring the pony to my parents' house to present to my daughter on christmas in front of the family? Also no. I try to be sensible, not censored, if that makes sense.\n\nMy brother is supporting Karen, as he says he's seen how upset she's been by all this (no mention of her daughter being upset, mind). I understand she probably berates him about it, and he wants her to be happy, so I can see why he's taking her side. On the other hand, he knows how our family has always done things, and he knows there's no ill will. He says he just doesn't want her upset, and he wants to be able to spend Christmas with us.", "But SIL gripes about her gifts from the siblings and parents too. As an adult. \n\nMost people realize that a D/SIL aren\u2019t going to get quite the level of gift as a daughter. Just because there\u2019s not the decades of knowing someone there.", "Nobody really caved. Her gifts haven't improved. I stopped buying her anything other than a candle years ago. If by 'caving' you mean we didn't ban her from holidays then I suppose we did cave, but it seemed a bit OTT to ban her. After this perhaps we should have.", "That was my first thought too!", "She was right about the gift disparity, however, at that point my parents had met her daughter one other time before Christmas, they didn't even know Karen that well at that point. Moreover, Karen's daughter is not their granddaughter.\n\nMy daughter doesn't receive significantly better presents from anyone in the family besides me and my husband. She does receive more, though, as my husband's family send her Christmas gifts as well. The same way my other brother's SO brings presents from their family to open on Christmas Day, that's what she means.\n\nIn my family, in families at large, I suspect, parents buy bigger gifts for their own children. So, compared to my brother, sure, Karen is getting 'shafted' but they aren't her parents so that sort of makes sense? My parents do the same with all our SOs, my husband's family gets him bigger christmas gifts than they get me. We don't disproportionately do this to Karen.", "And all the rules about gifts for her? That's got nothing to do with her kid.\n\nNTA op, at all", "I disagree if the child has all her biological grandparents and uncles and aunts, they are the one to be given the gifts, the step family is lovely to give her gift and treat her as equal as possible, but I don\u2019t think they need to do it if she has all her biological family", "Yeah, IDK, I once went to christmas dinner at my aunts and we opened presents afterwards. I got socks from my aunts family. They got better stuff from their parents (understandable ) but also opened presents from relatives who weren\u2019t even there (their side) and got ipods. That was unnecessary.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to open everything together!! Especially if they\u2019re not staying overnight (accommodations). Have a late start Christmas morning and open other presents (and put them away) before they get there!! Problem solved.", "I don\u2019t buy the same amount of presents for my sibling\u2019s kids that I buy for my own kids. That\u2019s TOTALLY NORMAL, step or not.\n\nMan I am grateful that we decided years ago that none of the adults need or want gifts from each other. We can just hang out and enjoy the occasion.", "In my experience, adults generally do not. Karen, however, does, much to our chagrin.", "But that was the first year when they didn't know her daughter. Now OP says they're equal. SIL just finds ways of complaining about it and holding a grudge.", "Grandparents should be relatively fair in their gift giving, but aunts and uncles? I think it's unreasonable to tell someone that you must spend as much on your niece/nephew that you do on your on children.\n\nIf my brother told me I had to spend the same on his kids and step kids as I do my own children, I'd laugh at him - that's not going to happen and it's not a reasonable expectation.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Good grief. That lady has got problems.\n\nNTA", "They may have explained it and she just heard what she wanted to hear. My SIL does that and weaponizes her therapist to get her way.

My main goal at Christmas is to see how cheap I can go while still giving a decent gift.

The entitlement! She sounds exhausting and any way you can shut that nonsense down before she ruins Christmas is entirely justifiable. NTA. Good luck!", "Maybe they could stay in a hotel instead of at your house, at least for Christmas eve night. That way you can do Christmas presents in the morning the way you want to then they can come over after. SIL can't be upset about the number of gifts other kids get if she doesn't see the number.", "Oh, well then I take that back. You did nothing wrong. Carry on. Lol. But do uninvite her now.", "My grandma has spare gifts for in case someone extra shows up for Christmas, but of course they\u2019re impersonal.", "This is completely normal, your SIL is being really entitled. As long as the grandparents and adults of the same relationship to the kids (uncles and aunts) are being fair with kid gifts that's enough.", "I can agree with what SIL says about gifts to her child from the grandparents. Makes sense. Her demanding gifts from you is entitled and rude. Her demanding that you don\u2019t gift your own child anything over 50\u00a3 in front of her child is\u2026.well I have no words. It really sounds like it would be best for everyone if they don\u2019t attend. A family get together on a holiday that doesn\u2019t involve presents would be better.", "Okay well I\u2019m not sure why I was downvoted for the question but thank you for such a thorough reply! \n\nI guess here\u2019s where I fall on it: it can be hard for children to feel like they\u2019re less worthy than other children. Kids don\u2019t understand nuances and situations the way that adults do, so I remember being kinda hurt when my cousins would get way more presents than me. Kids are inherently entitled, because all they\u2019ve known their whole life is that they get gifts at certain times of year, and they expect them and feel entitled to them. It isn\u2019t until the later teenage years that most children understand that they\u2019re NOT entitled to them and that they\u2019re lucky. But both of the girls appear to be younger than that. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your SIL\u2019s kids was kinda hurt by the disparity. Saying that, it\u2019s weird AF that your SIL is so upset about it. I mean, in your story she sounds insane, but is it possible that she\u2019s experienced lots of micro-aggressions from your family that you\u2019re not even aware of? Has she been made to feel like she has to fight for her place at the table? Because that\u2019s also how your situation reads: like a woman who is fighting to be taken seriously and is doing whatever she thinks is necessary to be treated equally.  How she is going about it is a bit bonkers, but feeling like the people who are supposed to be your family actually don\u2019t like you that much will do crazy things to a person\u2019s psyche. \n\nIn your shoes, I would try to show a bit of compassion this Christmas. Whatever her reason, she\u2019s clearly struggling. This might also be a great time to teach your daughter how to be gracious with those less fortunate. Have a conversation with your daughter, and explain that it\u2019s hard for her cousin to see her get twice the present she does. Ask her what she thinks you should do: open all her present at Christmas anyway, or save half for New Year\u2019s.  Talk to her about how fortunate she is, and explain that most children simply don\u2019t have what she has, and it\u2019s important to be aware of that as she goes through life. Your daughter might just surprise you. \n\nIn dealing with your SIL, I would call her, and explain that while you understand that she\u2019s really struggling with something, you were pretty shocked to see a list of demands. Explain that going forward, a quick phone call would get better results. Explain that you are VERY compassionate to personal issues, not demands on your household. And then find a way to talk to her, really find out what\u2019s going on here, there\u2019s probably more to the story than you know. \n\nI think there\u2019s a way to make this Christmas work for everyone, and to teach your daughter a great lesson about empathy along the way. Best of luck.\n\nEdit: spellings", "Also demanding that the child\u2019s paternal grandparents and aunts and uncles can\u2019t gift anything to OP\u2019s child on Christmas Day."]}
