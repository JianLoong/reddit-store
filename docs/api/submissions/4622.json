I often stay at work till late hours and don't always have time to make dinner, so Sarah does it for me 2-3 times a week. I rarely eat dinner, though, because my job provides me with food and I'm not hungry when I return home.\n\nWhen I got back home a few days ago I came into the kitchen and saw my whole family eating takeaway food from the local restaurant I really liked. I asked my husband whether he bought it but he said it was my daughter who ordered it for them (she has a part-time job). However, as I looked around I couldn't see any food left for me and asked my daughter where my portion is. Sarah responded by saying that she didn't bother ordering me food as well because I never eat dinner anyway and it would only go to waste as always. I was quite upset with her and told her that she still should've thought about me in case I was hungry and if she ordered the food for everyone why couldn't she order for me too.\n\nLong story short, we got into an argument and she told me that I shouldn't make her cook anyway because she's a child and has school and work responsibilities. Sarah also told me I always waste food because I never eat my portion and I only care because it's delivery food that I like. I responded that I am an adult and provide for her so I can't always make sure there's dinner on the table. After the argument, I sent her to her room and she refuses to make dinner since. My son is often hungry when he comes back because there's no dinner for him after school.\n\nAll my friends think she was the one acting unreasonably, but my husband is mad at me now and called me an asshole.

She is literally watching you throw away her hard work. So, instead of constantly watching you throw away her hard work, she just decided to stop wasting her time and not prepare food for you.
