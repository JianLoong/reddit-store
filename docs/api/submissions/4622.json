I often stay at work till late hours and don't always have time to make dinner, so Sarah does it for me 2-3 times a week. I rarely eat dinner, though, because my job provides me with food and I'm not hungry when I return home.\n\nWhen I got back home a few days ago I came into the kitchen and saw my whole family eating takeaway food from the local restaurant I really liked. I asked my husband whether he bought it but he said it was my daughter who ordered it for them (she has a part-time job). However, as I looked around I couldn't see any food left for me and asked my daughter where my portion is. Sarah responded by saying that she didn't bother ordering me food as well because I never eat dinner anyway and it would only go to waste as always. I was quite upset with her and told her that she still should've thought about me in case I was hungry and if she ordered the food for everyone why couldn't she order for me too.\n\nLong story short, we got into an argument and she told me that I shouldn't make her cook anyway because she's a child and has school and work responsibilities. Sarah also told me I always waste food because I never eat my portion and I only care because it's delivery food that I like. I responded that I am an adult and provide for her so I can't always make sure there's dinner on the table. After the argument, I sent her to her room and she refuses to make dinner since. My son is often hungry when he comes back because there's no dinner for him after school.\n\nAll my friends think she was the one acting unreasonably, but my husband is mad at me now and called me an asshole.

What an unhealthy lesson for her future relationships", "Mum can leave some dinner for next day or an easy meal like ingredients for sandwiches", "i can't tell if you're sarcastic or not but the onus shouldn't completely be on the daughter - she also has schoolwork. sure, she can prep for dinner but the husband should be helping out too", "Yeah using that time for homework is nerd behaviour /s", "YTA... also for implying your daughter is responsible for your son going hungry.", "Bot", "How about...\n\n**drumroll**\n\nDADDY DOES SOME FKN WORK TOO?\n\nThese two are not even doing the bare minimum as parents and OP has the gall to be angry at a kid.", "Yeah that\u2019s what made me put down my phone a bit. Like is he angry enough to MAKE HIS OWN DAMNED DINNER? Apparently not.", "LOL!  I missed the correlation on that one, you are so right!", "He should be old enough to make himself a snack. They could have prepackaged snacks available.", "She does mention somewhere that the 9yo is able to get some snacks - but he's still hungry cause no dinner...", "It's such a relief to read a comment like yours after reading a post like this.  \nPeople like to treat their kids like little housekeepers under the guise of 'it's just chores'; they prioritize responsibility over consent, the needs of those in power over the needs of the vulnerable.  \n\n\nSounds like you actually had a convo with your kiddos to find out what would work best for the family both individually and as a whole, and I love it.", "I also cook 3-4 a week for family since I was very small. (like literally 9-10 yrs old)\n\nThe difference is I LOVE COOKING and this was something I asked from my parents since cooking as a hobby was just wasting food so.\n\nHowever it wasnt an expectation, I cooked dinner when I had time and felt good. My parents were still at home and helped when necessary, I wasnt a substitute cook.\n\nAlso this family doesnt look like they are struggling so why not just have some meal service or anything to help them out instead of putting the burden on their child.\n\nIts not a chore suitable for a minor if it isnt a chore you can do yourself. Clearly its too much responsibility for her and her husband so why isnt it for her daughter?\n\nNext is, no chore should be something that is essential. Meaning to say, in this case her cooking is literally needed because otherwise the 9 yr old is hungry. She MUST cook those days otherwise people will be hungry HENCE why she ordered take out. She was probably tired and decided to just take the financial loss.\n\nChores should be a teaching moment and a way to help the household. It should not mean you are responsible for the household in any capacity.\n\nI.e. not doing dishes one night doesnt hurt anyone, it can be done in the morning if needed. Not cleaning your room 1 week wont hurt etc. \n\nBut expecting your child not to be allowed days where they are tired and cant do chores BECAUSE they are responsible for the household in that capacity is bad parenting.", "Yeah thats what mine did. I pretty much always made tacos lol. But I liked cooking. My dad always grilled when he was home early enough but he usually wasn\u2019t.  My brother likes cooking too so it wasn\u2019t that big a deal but it was once a week and my mom always made a huge thing on Sundays that covered the other nights with leftovers. It doesn\u2019t sound like this dad is contributing at all. And once a week is enough in high school.", "Yes, that would. It sounds like OP and her husband are neglecting their children. I was just clarifying that cooking dinner isn\u2019t a big chore in and of itself if the parents are doing the proper meal planning and keeping the house stocked with groceries. It doesn\u2019t sound like that is the case.", "And then making them pay if they don\u2019t cook? What!", "On the surface a teenager making the occasional supper is a normal chore that will prepare them for adulthood and independece.\n\nThe problem here is the lopsided division of labor by gender and the 9 yo old being either babied or neglected.", "But op and her husband are both well into adulthood and dont have to cook. Adults don't cook in ops world so cooking as a teen isn't preparing for adulthood", "To the point the the younger son goes hungry if she doesn\u2019t do it? Nah.", "It's a reasonable chore for a teenager but that means it's a reasonable chore for *all teenagers, boys included.* \n\nNow asking her to cook a few times a week that's fine, but if she's cooking then she's not cooking alone. Brother is nine. Maybe not old enough to make dinner by himself but he should be in the kitchen with her peeling vegetables, washing dishes, setting the table, doing something.  \n\nHe can start preparing for adulthood too. \n\nAnd dad at the very least can supervise and set aside something for his wife.", "When I was a teen, my brother & I each had 1 night a week to cook dinner. We got to pick the recipes out, so it was fun learning new recipes. However, we weren\u2019t held to it, or punished for not doing it because it wasn\u2019t a \u2018chore\u2019, like cleaning our rooms, or taking care of our pets. If we had a busy week with school or extracurriculars, we didn\u2019t cook. It was a valuable lesson because I could feed myself when I moved out, unlike my husband who didn\u2019t move from his parents until we moved in together at 25. OP isn\u2019t preparing her daughter for adulthood; she\u2019s just turned her into an au pair who she doesn\u2019t have to pay.", "I agree with you about snacking, but what OP wrote was that since the 16yo stopped cooking, the 9yo doesn't get dinner after school and is hungry.\nIt also supposes that they do buy snacks and we don't know that. Maybe there's nothing for the 9yo to make by himself.", "My 5 and 9 year old daughters are never left alone, and occasionally will wander into the kitchen and grab an apple or orange or some other fruit we have in the basket. Listen lady. YT fucking A", "Not really, because mom sure as hell does NOT make her man his dinner.", "I\u2019ve added the sarcasm sign to my comment. This is how OP put it in one of her responses - that the daughter has soooo much time to make dinner. Which is absolutely ridiculous imo, because although a teen should do her share of chores, her main focus should be on schoolwork, not feeding everyone", "The /s they put stands for sarcasm", "Yup. Comment stolen from u/Upstairs-Banana41", "I personally know she did, I was trying to get the person above me to realize that paying for everyone's dinner out of your own pocket when you're 16 is not a normal chore.", "At 16 I had about 3-4 hours of homework every night because of the advanced classes I was in. If my parents relied on me to cook dinner more than 1 night a week I would have started to fail classes. 2-3 nights a week is too many and the parents need to step up.", "It\u2019s probably a combination of both. First they established a rule that his teenage sister is responsible for feeding him, but when she stopped, they decided to just do nothing except complain that he\u2019s hungry", "Oh, right! lol", "Should have made my sarcasm more clear. I do believe that kids should have chores, but not the responsibility to feed their family 3x a week.", "Or he can pay for the takeaway at the very least. \n\nAnd I agree - the younger kid should be assigned with something, too, if it\u2019s all about chores and teaching kids to help parents keep the household going. As a minimum the parents could have taught him how to whip up an after school snack.", "Tbh, I didn\u2019t really get that part - why is the 9yo having dinner right after school? Or maybe he comes home from extracurricular activities just in time for dinner, idk.", "I agree that they fail him and their daughter by not providing dinner, but the comment thread I was replying to was saying the 9YO shouldn\u2019t have to get a snack if his dad is home and that\u2019s just silly. \n\nTo reiterate: parents should be providing dinner for their kids.\n\nEdited to add: and if there is truly NOTHING for the child to eat, then that is neglect. Again, a piece of fruit, some crackers, a PB sandwich, a granola bar are all options for a quick **snack** to hold the kid over until dinner, is all I was saying.", "My 10yo comes home from school around 2.30pm and eats whatever she chooses from the fridge - could be a sandwich, could be fruit, could be yesterday\u2019s leftovers. And before she was ever home alone, she did the same as your daughters - just grab what\u2019s in the fruit basket. A mentally sound child of that age will literally never go hungry in a kitchen that has food in it.", "True. But dad is fuming that daughter won\u2019t cook for him now. Makes me thinks she used to", "Yeah, sorry I didn't catch that. Completely agree w/ you - I feel sorry for the daughter dude", "Wait, there is a sarcasm sign \ud83d\ude10 when did I become old for the internet", "I bet the daughter doesn\u2019t actually have all that much time too! I totally remember having a part time job in high school, and with homework I was lucky to get an hour a day of time that was actually mine. (And honestly that was me procrastinating because I desperately needed a break).", "they edited the comment to add that later on", "Thank you for clarification on the  /s\nI downloaded it until I saw your explanation and then took it back.", "I see, I agree with that!", ">whip up an after school snack.\n\nAn after school snack *for the family.* \n\nYou're never too young to learn how to make a charcuterie board.", "It would appear that this 9 year old has been taught that folks with dangly bits are handed nourishment only by folks without them. If there are no women around, whatever shall he do?", "FFS, right?!! My son walks into the kitchen and knows which drawers have his breakfast stuff, snacks and fruit packs/pouches, and his drink mixes. He will gladly go grab something, then bring it to us to see if he can have it... and he turns 3 in fucking MARCH!!!! From 2nd grade to end of 5th, I walked a block and a half home from school, turned on the TV, and made a snack to hold me over til dinner. I can't understand this at all xD", "Yes, there is, as I\u2019ve learned recently! And I make a point of using it because otherwise I confuse people and get downvoted to hell lol", "Good to know!", "Indicators like that help people clarify since tone is hard to convey over text (especially if you don't know the people) \ud83d\ude0a", "And calling it getting ready for adulthood is pretty ridiculous, too, unless they are preparing her for marriage with 3 kids by the age of 20", "I highly recommend that you read OP\u2019s responses to the comments. The level of craziness around feeding that 9yo is astounding. Apparently he is able to get himself a snack, but he continues to be hungry and has to wait an entire 2 hours til dinner.", "I shall up vote every post I see for you for teaching this"]}
