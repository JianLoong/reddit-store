Considering that you are happy to take care of him for the rest of his life, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much point in tough love. You\u2019re not trying to get him to radically change his life at 51, so shaming him for it is a little bit fucked up. He was definitely being a dick, but he\u2019s obviously projecting his own insecurities and he didn\u2019t name your BIL publicly so I think going as far as you did was disproportionate. He\u2019s obviously ashamed of himself or he wouldn\u2019t have lied about being an investment banker. His online friends are probably some of the only people in his life who have some respect for him and you just blew that all up.\n\nIf you were trying to get him to become self sufficient then calling him out publicly for his hypocrisy would be warranted. But, since you know he\u2019s never going to change and are in fact paying for everything for him, maybe let him have what few victories he can get so he can have some self respect, if not dignity. From your description it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s an asshole, just incapable of caring for himself. Since you\u2019ve decided to care for him, what are you trying to accomplish by shaming him publicly?

It may not come off that way from my post, but I honestly can't blame him for being who he is. Our parents spoiled him rotten, and treated every small accomplishment he made (getting C's rather than his normal D's) as if it were the most amazing thing on Earth. They basically worshiped him while the rest of us got the shaft. I've gotten to the point that I realize none of that was his fault, so I no longer resent him the way I did in my teens. Now I understand how the \"hugbox\" he grew up in basically guaranteed his failure. I can't say I would have done any better in his shoes. \n\n>If you didn't have the money you did, would you be taking care of him? \n\nI would do whatever I could, as long as it was not harming my wife and kids. I would not take food out of their mouths to feed him, but I would help as best I could.", "He's got (really good) insurance, and a car. Nothing is stopping him from getting himself help if he wants it. But, if someone doesn't want help, all the therapy in the world isn't gonna do anything. I've spoken to him about therapy in the past, but it's just not something he wants to pursue.", "Our parents didn't really believe in that stuff, so he never got tested when he was younger. As for now, he has no desire to go to a shrink, so there's no real way to force the issue. He's not a harm to himself or others.", "His brother is the one who posted the rant about people not being able to be self-sufficient, making it clear it was about OP's BIL. You know what they say about people in glasshouses.", "Just wanna say you sound like a really good dude. NTA.", "And what happens if he outlives you??", "But it\u2019s not like the horse isn\u2019t drinking, right? Your horse is fucking guzzling at the tap because the tap never turns off.\n\nThe way you made *any* animal do anything is by putting it in a position where it has to.", "If you want to get that horse to drink, salt the hay.", "This is quite literally one of the sweetest things I've read on here! Glad you're happy OP, you and your wife sound very lucky to have one another!", ">so I take care of him because no one else will.\n\nbut you aren't actually caring for him because you enable his teenager mentality.", "My dear OP,  \n\nYour actions are condemning your brother to this empty life of nothingness.  \nNo goals. No accomplishments. Nothing he can say he truly did for himself.  \nIt's tragic.  \nHe is not a good brother to you. \nHe's a liar. He's judgemental. He's entitled. He's selfish.  \nIf he really thinks that your brother in law is asking for a handout, tell him that you'll cut him the same deal.  \nThat's fair, right?\nIt's what he was complaining about.   \n\nSix months to find a job where he can support himself and be a grown up.  \nIf you feel that is too harsh, you can cover half of his living expenses for the next 40 years.  \nThis is your life, OP. You were meant to live it for you, your wife, and your children.", "Fair enough. Can\u2019t force a horse to drink the water so to speak.", "So if I were you I would consider encouraging him into getting some information, at least. But it would be really tricky, as he's not really young adult and you've just humiliated him - bear in mind I'm not changing my opinion and I still consider you NTA here, I'm just stating facts. \n\nOf course the most likely outcome is nothing changing altogether, but if you intend to care for him anyways, then maybe it's worth the shot.", "He never mentioned any names and i am pretty sure people other than the brother and his wife will be able to figure that one out", "I have this with my BIL and SIL. They live with my parents in law, but because they aren\u2019t physically receiving cash from them (just\u2026 a home and good and use of the car\u2026\u2026) they don\u2019t think they\u2019re scrounging. Legit said they were \u2018financially independant\u2019", "The thing he's not \"drinking\" is education, therapy, or really anything that will better his station in life. I could pay a tuition for a school that he's not gonna show up to, but that's not helping anyone but the school. It'd basically be a donation to the college.", "> you and your wife sound very lucky to have one another!\n\nI'm definitely the lucky one, haha. I've spent the past 3 decades trying to be the best man I can, because she's the best woman in the world. I'll never understand why she picked me, but I'm damn sure glad she did.", "> He's a liar.\n\nHave you never told a lie in your life? I certainly have.\n\n> He's judgemental.\n\nAnd you're on AITA, lol!!!", ">My brother proceeded to head over to Facebook and post a rant about how people need to be more self-reliant and not ask for handouts they didn't earn. He didn't mention my BiL by name, **but it was pretty clear that that's what triggered his rant.**", "You're a really nice person but this is the reality people who don't have loving millionaire brothers live in and it's wild that he is so divorced from that. At 51!!!", "So instead he is selling hours of YOUR time at a much higher premium?", "NTA, you seem to be such a great human. Has he tried bartending or something in that sense that isn\u2019t  working under corporate? Maybe like a small local bar that will keep him interested, and looking forward to go into work. You seem to have a big heart but sometimes with siblings it can be a downfall. I had an uncle that sounds like this. He had every job you could think of from being a nurse, coal miner, etc\u2026He would work for a month and secretly quit and lie about it. Nothing was ever up to his standards. He ended up dying alone and by the end everyone hated him because he was so lazy. My grandparents started from nothing and built several successful business and sold them all thinking they would have an easy retirement but my uncle took most of that away from them. Everyone has resentment towards him because he never had to work for anything in his life. You need to give him an ultimatum even if it takes him a year to save up money. You\u2019re kids are going to eventually resent him because he never had to work and takes your money for free. I know you said you\u2019re well-off but life comes at you fast and what if you\u2019re not here to support him. I know you\u2019re well-off and a smart guy but you can\u2019t enable someone like this. You need to show an example for your children and family that if you atleast try to work hard and be a good person then you can be awarded for it. (I\u2019m sorry if any of this is rude but at his age he should want more for himself.)", "Amazing.\n\nI also personally hate selling my time for dirty capitalist currency, but I never thought I had a choice. Now I see I have options.\n\nI\u2019ll DM you an estimate for *my* monthly expenses, too. As a millionaire, you won\u2019t even notice. It\u2019s pocket change for you at most.\n\nThis is going to be great! Thanks a bunch, pal!", "Ohhhh, the irony of your brothers comment.  \n\n\u201cThe most dangerous irony is, people are angry with others because of their own incompetence.\"", "You tell him a condition of his room and board is to find employment or pursue education. You have given him ample reason to remain content in his situation, and no reason to change it.", "Again \u2014 he isn\u2019t because you\u2019ve made it very comfortable for him not to.", "And your on AITA \ud83d\ude0f", "My point stands, pretty clear to him and his wife not some random dude he plays games with online or the public", "every time i feel imposter syndrome coming on i'll remember this 51 year old with NO SKILLS (according to his brother who loves and supports him) and his inability to work at walmart. bless this post.", "He's past fifty with no qualifications (granted, a high school diploma from thirty years ago wouldn't be much worth on its own today) and a work history a teenager might have. Entering the job market even as it stands would tough at entry level for someone who claims not to want to support capitalism (yet is happy for his brother to spend money on food, weed, video games and anything else he desires). At the very least he can learn to help around the house. You don't need a qualification to run the vacuum or wash dishes.", "He stayed with our mom until she passed, and then I just sort of took over. Didn't want to see him end up like one of those people on Skid Row. So his whole life he's never really had to do for himself.", "To be fair, I don't work for my money. I live off passive income.", "You're just jealous.", "Well, he probably plays Adventure Capitalist and has trillions there.", "Yes! Very much so!\n\nI can do nothing with the best of them.
