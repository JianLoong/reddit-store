Nothing you said was wrong, but you didn\u2019t have to put him on blast like that publicly. Considering that you are happy to take care of him for the rest of his life, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much point in tough love. You\u2019re not trying to get him to radically change his life at 51, so shaming him for it is a little bit fucked up. He was definitely being a dick, but he\u2019s obviously projecting his own insecurities and he didn\u2019t name your BIL publicly so I think going as far as you did was disproportionate. He\u2019s obviously ashamed of himself or he wouldn\u2019t have lied about being an investment banker. His online friends are probably some of the only people in his life who have some respect for him and you just blew that all up.\n\nIf you were trying to get him to become self sufficient then calling him out publicly for his hypocrisy would be warranted. But, since you know he\u2019s never going to change and are in fact paying for everything for him, maybe let him have what few victories he can get so he can have some self respect, if not dignity. From your description it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s an asshole, just incapable of caring for himself. Since you\u2019ve decided to care for him, what are you trying to accomplish by shaming him publicly?
