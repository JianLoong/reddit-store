He's never really been \"good at life\". He's had a few jobs here and there, but mostly just stuff like Walmart, McDonald's, and he delivered pizzas for about a month. He's never held down a job for more than 60 days. He dropped out of High School, and never bothered to get a GED, let alone any college/trade school. He mostly just sits in his room drinking my booze, smoking my pot, and eating my food while he plays whatever JRPG he's currently obsessed with.  \n\nI don't mind this, I truly don't. I did well in life, and my wife invested our money **very** well. So we're comfortable. I have more than enough resources to support him fully for the rest of our lives, and I intend to do so. He's not taking food out of my kids mouths, he's not cutting into their college funds. It's literally extra money that I would just be squirreling away if I didn't spend it on him.   \n\nLast night at dinner, my wife told me that her brother lost his job (he worked for a company that recently had MASSIVE layoffs, so it was due to no fault of his own), and asked me if we could float him some cash for bills and stuff while he finds a new job. I told her to have him send me an estimate of how much he needs to cover 6 months, and that was that (or so I thought).  \n\n\nMy brother proceeded to head over to Facebook and post a rant about how people need to be more self-reliant and not ask for handouts they didn't earn. He didn't mention my BiL by name, but it was pretty clear that that's what triggered his rant.   \n\nI commented on his post, and I asked him how living off of me for the past 9 years was \"self-reliant\". I told him that he is in an incredibly privileged position, because not everyone has a millionaire brother to pay all their bills for them. I also asked how the allowance I give him every week is not a \"handout\". \n\nAnyway, a bunch of his friends from his video game started clowning on him in the comments (apparently he tells people online that he's an investment banker). He deleted the post, and has not come out of his room since (there is an en-suite bathroom, don't worry).  \n\nMy wife says it was fucked up for me to call him out publicly like that, and that I could have been more respectful about it, and my aunt is FURIOUS with me for \"airing the family laundry\". \n\nSo I kinda think I might be the asshole here.

Why are you enabling your brother?  You're not doing him any favors.", "ESH.  Why do people feel the need to post all their drama on facebook?  He lives in your house, he posted something on facebook, and instead of speaking to him, you chose to drag him him in public.  Was he an AH? Of course he was.  Did he have it coming?  Yes.  Did it take an AH to give it to him?  Also yes.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

You are both extraordinarily generous to have done this. \n\nBut this dude's past 50. He's seriously gotta do something.

He lied to his friends about what he does for some reason, then he tried to rant because someone else reminds him of himself, and you called him out, which isn't a bad thing.

He knows he should be doing more with his life, that's why he told people he was an investment banker. He should have known better than to accuse someone who lost their job due to no fault of their own when he himself hadn't been employed for more than a month and a half and is only where he is due to his brother's good will.", "NTA. Handled it nicely.", "NTA but he got what he deserved. He shouldn't run his mouth like that. \n\nThe problem is that he doesn't view the wealth you've earned as yours. He views it as \"ours\". You should sit him down and make sure he understands that you take care of him out of the goodness of your heart and that he has no say at all about how you spend your money.  You sound very generous with your family. Auntie can sit down and shut up or make arrangements to come pick him up to live with her.", "NTA \u2014 You say that you don\u2019t mind his mooching off you for the past 9 years (or more maybe) but obviously you would like him to at least appreciate it and recognize that he is not entitled, and certainly no better than someone who after working hard falls on hard times.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for feeling that way.  And maybe it was time your brother had a reminder that he should not feel superior to people when he is just lucky that you put up with his mooching and provide generously for him.", "Absolutely NTA. He started this publicly. He got what he deserved.", "YTA\n\nYou should have talked to him in private. \n\nWhat do you care about his public persona. He probably knows he isn\u2019t self reliant and doesn\u2019t want to world to know. He made that persona do to a low self esteem. \n\nYou absolutely call him out publicly for no good reason.", "NTA. You commented on HIS post. He was the pot calling the kettle black. Brother has some apologising to do to BIL. Thank you for compassion towards your family. It makes the world a better place, and not many siblings are so supportive!", "NTA.

It's pretty hypocritical behaviour by him, but calling him out online is a tiny bit harsh if you're otherwise OK with the situation, and you haven't raised it in conversation in the past.", "NTA. Your brother is quite happy to live the life of handouts and do nothing to further himself or contribute to his own expenses but has the gall to call you out for helping someone who has genuinely fallen on bad times? He is now unhappy you set him straight. Tough. Perhaps he will start thinking twice before being a hypocrite.", "> Your aunt seems very fond of him - will she be taking him in soon?\n\nShe literally can't.

He may need some kind of cognitive therapy or medication so he can focus on whatever he should be doing, be it schooling or working. \n\nI honestly don't know. I pay for his insurance, but he's never been to a head-doctor. He has access, but he's a grown man, I can't exactly force him into a shrink's office. \n\n>Btw, has she been helping him at all? If not, she can't say shit. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nShe's poor, living off of SSI, and stays in publicly subsidized Senior Housing, so there isn't really much she can do.

It'd be one thing if he were *dangerous*. Like, I'd toss him out in a heartbeat if I felt we weren't safe with him here. But being a bit of a prick isn't enough for me to make him homeless. And that's what I'd essentially be condemning him to. There's nowhere else to go, and he has no skills that could make him enough money to survive.", "The more I think about this, the more shocking I find their attitudes.", "I can't in my right mind ask you to figure it out for him because you already have given him so much, but it may very well be worth the effort for him to get looked at.

Even a cheap apartment out here is $600/mo. So that's like 2 weeks of full time work (before taxes) just to pay rent.

You can provide him free rent, on the condition that he does something to be a productive member of society. It\u2019s true that minimum wage isn\u2019t great, but he\u2019s also privileged enough to not be in a position where this is his last resort.
