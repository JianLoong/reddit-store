Considering that you are happy to take care of him for the rest of his life, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much point in tough love. You\u2019re not trying to get him to radically change his life at 51, so shaming him for it is a little bit fucked up. He was definitely being a dick, but he\u2019s obviously projecting his own insecurities and he didn\u2019t name your BIL publicly so I think going as far as you did was disproportionate. He\u2019s obviously ashamed of himself or he wouldn\u2019t have lied about being an investment banker. His online friends are probably some of the only people in his life who have some respect for him and you just blew that all up.\n\nIf you were trying to get him to become self sufficient then calling him out publicly for his hypocrisy would be warranted. But, since you know he\u2019s never going to change and are in fact paying for everything for him, maybe let him have what few victories he can get so he can have some self respect, if not dignity. From your description it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s an asshole, just incapable of caring for himself. Since you\u2019ve decided to care for him, what are you trying to accomplish by shaming him publicly?

Make him contribute to the household, even if it just $50 a week.  He has no incentive to do anything so make him.  Not to punish him, but to show him that most people have to work, even these low paying jobs just to get by and don't have a rich sibling to bail them out. If he or your aunt don't like it, then he can leave or your aunt can take him in. \n\nCould you have done this in private? Yes. But he needed a come to Jesus moment and a wake up call.", "Ugh. I hate being a slave to the capitalist machine too but you gotta do what you gotta do, unfortunately. Might be time he learns that.", "If you're giving him money anyways, you could tie that to a condition that he be employed. So he might be making 8 bucks an hour at Walmart, with your stipend that would be 20 bucks an hour.\n\nEven if he would be working part time, 20 hours a week, it will make him healthier, happier and live a more fulfilling life.\n\nThat still leaves plenty of time for booze, pot and video games.", "He should work for you then. Not at your job - dear God not at your job - but he should earn his spending money from your household. Dishes, vacuuming, grocery shopping, window washing, mowing- you know, the same way every other 11 year old gets allowance.", "Even then he can save your handouts and get a PART time job and would be able to live on his own. Also he\u2019s in his 50s but has on out had a few jobs? When did he decide to stop working", "Wait, why do you think it's OK to saddle your wife with your brother's care? Just because you have enabled his uselessness, doesn't make it ok for him to be an obligation you pass down.", "That\u2019s kind. Kind of\u2026\n\nThe yukky part, as I see it, isn\u2019t that you\u2019re supporting him financially. It\u2019s that he\u2019s so severely lacking in empathy and you\u2019re enabling that.\n\nIf I were you I might attach some strings. Like he has to be involved in the community in a positive way.  Drive people who can\u2019t get around, do the stockroom at the food bank, work at the humane society\u2026 whatever. \n\nYou\u2019re harbouring an AH and it\u2019s not good.", "This is not legally sound. Telling your son how much to send him does nothing to protect him from your son spending or losing the money or simply deciding he doesn't want to anymore. If you are that serious about it you need to draw up a trust and have this in the will.", "And if your kids want to live like their uncle lives?", "Have a talk with your wife about your brother. I am sorry but he seems like such a burden.", "Yea.. if he were 31 I would say it\u2019s definitely not too late, but he would probably just flounder at this point", "The fact he thinks capitalism is slavery yet he's a parasite on what the communists would call a parasite speaks volumes of his vast and well researched ideology :D", "I'm glad yall got raises. It was $8.25/hr back in 2014 when he was working there.", "Yes, maybe he could run an arcade for OP, one with Japanese games. Can you \"invest\" in a business like that?", "I know this is a controversial opinion but does it really matter if OP is enabling him? OP is a millionaire who doesn't mind paying for his brother. If everyone is happy with the situation and can afford it, why does the brother have to work? I know we've all been brainwashed to think our purpose in life is to work as much as possible but if you're privileged enough to not have to work I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Plus the brother is in his 50s with almost no work history - it'd be really difficult for him to even find a job.", "It sounds like the original enablers were their parents.  We don\u2019t know the full story, and OP didn\u2019t ask for our criticism of what he\u2019s done for his brother.  \n\nThe brother sounds like a sad case and I bet he doesn\u2019t like himself much.  However, he can\u2019t build himself up by condemning others, especially when he himself is guilty of what he condemns.\n\nOP may not have been tactful in calling out his brother publicly, but he had every right to be indignant and his brother set himself up for it. (People who live in glass houses\u2026)  Maybe it will make the brother think twice the next time.", "You're not the first person to suggest volunteer work. That might be a good idea for him. The SPCA is always looking for extra hands, and they aren't too far from us. He loves animals, so he might be open to it.", "> Wait, why do you think it's OK to saddle your wife with your brother's care?\n\nBecause we discussed it, and she said she is willing to do it. You know, like adults do?", "Unless he\u2019s already done so and made his son the trustee\u2026", "But I don't complain about people being judgmental.", "He\u2019s really good at online monopoly.", "I can\u2019t get past where he thinks his wealthy brother earned his money. Capitalism is ok when it\u2019s earning enough to support his privilege but bad when he\u2019s asked to work in the system. Yikes.", "OP, why not get him involved in a good local charity?\n\nSoup kitchen...\nBoys and Girls club...\nHomeless shelter for other men...\nWildlife or pet rescue...\n\nThis way he gives *something* back to the world.\n\nAnd the time is perfect.   The holidays this year are going to be hard for a lot of people with their student loans now coming due. Most high schools have an Adopt-a-Student.  Burlington Coat Factory usually has an Adopt-a-Senior tree.  Many places do the same for shelter pets.\n\nGive him a couple hundred bucks and tell him to shop for a family for Thanksgiving this week.\n\nI mean, dude, there are literally endless things a wealthy person can do regarding their free time.  It is why many wealthy people establish foundations.\n\nHe cannot have an argument against it that will hold any water.", "OK that's kind of you, but what if you outlive him? Are your kids expected to take care of him for the rest of his life then? Or will they even be in a position to, if they grew up their whole life with the experience that staying at home without even attempting to get a job is a totally valid and easy way to live your life. NTA for calling out a social media post, but this setup doesn't seem sustainable to me.", "NTA. What happens if you pass first? Will your wife take over yoyr role or just nudge him out the foir?", "And now you\u2019re enabling him. He has no skills, no spouse, just video games. That sounds like the most miserable life.", "Your NTA but you do realize that the post he made is because he was upset you you are going to spend money on someone not him right? He is being greedy with your money, which from what you have said there is more than enough to go around but he now feels entitled to it because you have let him mooch for so long. He is jealous that you would help someone else who from what it seems was supporting themselves unlike your brother you need to have a long talk to your brother about how it is your money and you can spend it how you want. You may also ask him how he would feel and what would happen if you cut him off. I am not saying that you should but you need to make him understand that he has no right to your money nor should he have an opinion on how you spend it. And he should not make any posts like that or you will have him get a job and support himself. It shouldn't be a hollow threat. You are an enabler who has turned tour brother spoiled and entitled.\n\nSorry for any errors", "He doesn't even have a high school diploma or GED, though. So he really has zero qualifications. He's a permanent teenager because no one has forced him to change, and at 51, I think he may be beyond changing.", "But surely for his emotional well-being he should have the opportunity to contribute SOMETHING to society. I enjoy video games but to look back on my life and have done nothing else is depressing.", "Still gains from the capitalist machine..  tainted money.. :)", "Well but op doesn\u2019t seem happy with this, given the post . I understand he can afford to host him but I\u2019m just not sure if it\u2019s both of there best interests to be dependent on him. I hate to be that person but they aren\u2019t that far apart in age, if this continues into old age it will be very problematic if op passes or something happens then the brother won\u2019t have a source of income and at that age working wouldn\u2019t be a possibility now. If I was the brother I\u2019d attempt to find a job even if I can live there still, just so I\u2019d have a form of self sufficiency . Or like I said in another comment I think it\u2019s fair that the brother to do tidying around the house and do the yard work atleast", "Stop asking if he is open to it, and start deciding that he needs to do something with his life. You are not his parent, but since you are funding his existence, you can tell him that he needs to do something.", "Volunteer work with animals might be great to make him feel better about himself (which I am sure he needs).  And you know, he doesn\u2019t need to lie that he is an investment banker.  He can claim he took early retirement.", "I'm not complaining. You asked for judgement. I'm giving you mine.", "I agree with this. Working for a living isn't for everyone. But they should do *something* productive or creative or worthwhile. Even making a video game in RPG Maker instead of just playing games is at least creating something.", "Mentoring programs usually want an adult who will be a good influence on the kids. Not a ne'er-do-well who games all day, never completed high school, and lies on the internet.", "OP is rich enough to have set up a trust for his brother in case he passes first. It's a very common practice for rich people. We're not talking about someone who has a good income, OP is so rich that he doesn't have to work and he can support his brother and BIL. I do agree with you that the brother should at least do housework or volunteering etc. But it seems OP is happy with supporting his brother, he's just not happy about his brother lying about it online.", "Mate just suggest him to be a youtuber or a streamer. Hes already spending time playing games with friends. Their shenanigans can potentially entertain ppl", "I\u2019m not sure whether your infinite reserves of patience with this man are more a blessing or a curse, but they\u2019re unquestionably impressive.", "OP I think I love you. The genuine love for your brother to support him as much as you do, but also completely clowning on him where it's fully deserved. Absolutely perfect.", "Could also be a good way for him to learn editing, marketing and other relevant 21st century skills\n\nSince he has no pressure to actually be successful at it, this honestly seems like a great idea", "Given his way of going about things he would stoke some big controversy early on lol", "Now THAT could work.", "Nothing about OPs brother makes it sound like there is a single redeeming quality about him that anyone would enjoy watching on stream/YT."]}
