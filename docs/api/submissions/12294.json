They \"punished him\" by making him take care of the baby by himself. They helped him financially until he finished high school, but the parenting job was supposed to be done by him alone.\n\nI have always helped my mom with my younger siblings and I like kids overall, so I offered my help. My friend happily accepted and I've been helping him with Liam (Jack's son) ever since. \n\nJack's parents have been alright with me helping him, but ever since I came out last year they've been clearly more rude towards me. His mom even told me I shouldn't help Jack with the kid when his dad is at home cause \"the image bothered him\".\n\nJack has noticed the change in treatment too and asked me if it would be alright with me if he and his son moved into my apartment. We discussed it and came with the conclusion that moving with me benefited everyone involved. Last night I stayed for dinner so Jack gave the news there, and it wasn't taken very well.\n\nJack's parents accused me of overstepping. They said they're thankful of the help I gave Jack the first years, but that I have taken it too far and that it was time for Jack to find a partner to raise Liam with, instead of keeping me involved this much in their lives. Jack told me to not worry about what they said, but I can't help but be bothered by it.\n\nAITA? I've always considered myself just a good friend lending a hand but maybe I indeed went too far?

It doesnt matter what it looks like, or even is, all that matters is that someone helps and loves the kid, which you and Jack do.", "NTA. \n\n1. The forced their son into parenting as a 'punishment'. Zero regard for this literal human being raised as a punishment. \n2. The don't want to help, they don't want you to help. \n3. They're homophobic AF\n4. They now want their son at 20. years. old to find a life partner. I assume much like the child, this woman is just another pawn in the punishment scheme of life they want.", "NTA...Jack's life is no longer any of his parents' business. It's time for him to tell them to but out. You're a good friend helping someone in a tricky situation.", "LOL???? NTA. I can\u2019t believe these parents they\u2019re weird asf. First of all, punishing a SIXTEEN year old with taking care of a kid by himself while still in school sounds absolutely insane. Now that he\u2019s older you helping out when he should\u2019ve gotten help from the mother and parents from the beginning and then being called an AH for it is ridiculous. When will they stop punishing their son that already is being punished by having a kid in the first place??? Continue helping him out and forget the parents. They seem more like police to me.", "NTA. Oh, you and Jack get to decide the arrangement that works for you. His parents are homophobic.", "NTA\n\nI love all these posts where the parent is being \"punished\" by having to take care of a child.  \"Hey, our kid screwed up, let's make sure we wreck our grandchild just to prove we're tough on bad behavior.\"  Gawd it's so clich\u00e9 and old.\n\nThe grandparents need to mind their own business.  Do what works for you.", "Nta. thier opinion on the matter is tainted by bigotry and they aren't placing the needs of their grandson first.", "NTA.\nSo they didn\u2019t really want to help their son / grandson themselves? But are also mad at how their son chose to get help in order to survive the  very tough life that single parenthood is, especially as a teen/young adult?\n\nYeah that\u2019s not how that works.\n\nYou guys have a good thing going and I\u2019d just roll with it. Go low contact if needed.", "**NTA**\n\n>They said . . . that it was time for Jack to find a partner to raise Liam with, instead of keeping me involved this much in their lives. \n\nI say this as someone who is probably around the same age as his parents: \n\nThe clear homophobia is bad enough, obviously. But says everything anyone needs to know about what kind of cold, manipulative human beings that they are, that they would rather see both their son and some unsuspecting young woman - pretty much ANY young woman as far as they're concerned - get rushed into an ill-advised serious relationship at such a young age for the sake of \"having a (marital) partner\" (and the unspoken \"forcing motherhood responsibilities on the young woman\") rather than wanting their son to take his time dating, and hopefully meet someone IN HIS OWN TIME, WHEN HE IS READY, who will become a genuine and meaningful part of his and Liam's life because that's what they all want.  \n\nIt says everything that they think there's something problematic about . . . what, exactly? A 20-year-old single dad living with his supportive, responsible best friend as a roommate? Their grandson having a loving \"uncle\" helping to raise him? I don't know, from where I stand as a middle aged woman, that sounds like a wonderfully loving situation.\n\nHoney, you are absolutely NTA. You are a wonderful friend, and both Jack and Liam are lucky to have you.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s none of their business and they should focus on working out their homophobia. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, keep going!", "NTA. They\u2019re homophobic. They would have no issue with their son moving in with a female or a straight man.", "This is 100% the parents who are arseholes. They punished him by making him look after the baby alone at 16 years old. They liked you until they found out you aren't straight, so they're homophobic. \n\nIt sounds like Jack and Liam are both better off as far away from his grandparents as possible. You should carry on being an awesome friend and father-figure.", "NTA, problem as I see it is you\u2019ve invested time into Jack and co so you\u2019re bound to be involved in family dynamics.  I get family dynamics from parents of friends and I don\u2019t even live with them. I can\u2019t see any fault with Jacks parents wanting what is best for their son either? Welcome to the family OP eh? \n\nDon\u2019t you have your own thing to do/life to live? Isn\u2019t Jack moving out/finding a place for himself the end goal anyway?", "NTA. The parents need to check their homophobia. They were cool letting you step up and coparent with your friend until you came out, and now they want to attack you without offering any help in your place. They sound selfish and small-minded. Let them worry about what other people will think --you're an amazing friend and Jack and Liam are lucky you're around.", "NTA. I hope Jack goes NC with them. They're horrible parents and horrid people. \n\n(Also the concept of a friend helping another friend raise a child platonic is adorable)", "NTA\n\nYou're both adults, and his parents don't get to tell him how to live his life or raise his kid. His parents can be mad all they want, and they can be uncomfortable with you all they want, but it's Jack who gets to make the choices, and his feelings toward you and your participation are all that matters in this situation.\n\nThey're concerned the baby will catch the gay... we all know that's not how it works, but older generations are less on board with that and still worry about it like it's contagious. This is also probably a reason Jack wants to move in with you: to escape his judgy parents. \n\nYou've done nothing wrong, and I'm happy for all three of you. His parents will adjust, or they won't, and that exclusively affects their relationship, or lack of one, with Jack and Liam. You are not responsible for how other people feel about things, and especially so when it comes to homophobia and traditional values...", "NTA. I\u2019m glad Jack and Liam are leaving their homophonic toxic house- they deserve a full and good life and it sounds like living with you is a great step to getting that. At 20, your friend is an adult who gets to decide who to allow in his kids life- and his parents need to see that the helpful friend is a way better option than the nastiness they bring to the table.", "NTA\n\nJack has a partner to raise his kid with in you. It's just not a romantic/sexual partnership with a woman. Kiddo is the priority and it sounds like he has two adults who love him and put him first. If neither Liam nor Jack have any issue with you, Jack's parents can go kick rocks.\n\nEdited for grammar", "You are a great friend OP.  If you had been a girl, the parents probably would have been cool with it and encouraged more involvement.  Obviously, they are homophobes.   Jack is grown and can make his own decisions about where he lives, who he hangs with, and how he raises Liam.  Just keep being the great friend you are and do what works for you.  NTA", "Any ability Jack's parents had to discipline him and ESPECIALLY to require other people to enact that discipline for them is gone.  He's grown, he's a parent, they aren't paying to support him.  You have zero obligation to listen to their opinions on how he is to be raised.\n\nPersonally in this situation I'd be tempted to do a fake dating thing with Jack just to piss them off since a lot of their objection seems to come down to homophobia (and hey!  A partner to raise Liam with is what they wanted!), but that's unproductive so don't do that.  You're NTA for being a generous, supportive friend.", "Jack's parents basically decided they were keeping their grandkid, the mom doesn't have to be involved, and pushed all care on Jack as punishment. So to help alleviate this, you are helping Jack. Now Jack and son are moving in with you because Jack's parents continue to be assholes and Jack's parents are mad they can't keep punishing their son for having a kid at 16 while also being not surprise bigots. \n\nWhy do you care what Jack's parents think? They're just screwing with Jack. NTA and stop worrying about this.\n\nEta: Co parenting kids in non romantic relationships is not strange. It's basically inevitable because so many people abandon children. The kids go somewhere. The number of kids in foster care is probably 1/8 of the actual kids being fostered. \n\nI know someone that is co parenting a FTM kid that was kicked out of their original home. The kid goes back and forth between my friend's home and one of my friend's friend's homes. The adults are in their 40s and kid is 16. The adults are not and have never in a relationship with each other. \n\nI know someone else that co-raised their roommates little sister with the roommate. Completely platonic relationship. They raised her from seven to adult. \n\nEspecially if you look at more community focused cultures, you will definitely see this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You might develop feelings for Jack if you haven\u2019t already. His family is reading it that way, though their concerns are more homophobic and misogynistic in that they want Jack to marry a girl and saddle her with child care. Jack, might be taking advantage of you too. He might know you have feelings and want you to be there for his son. I\u2019d hope he isn\u2019t but you\u2019re being in a parental role for his son and in effect coparenting is what is happening. If you have feelings for Jack, I hope he does for you too.

Thing is, their good person sensor is broken, and looking to them for any kind of validation will get you an automatic guilty verdict. You're guilty of being gay, sorry.\n\nIt's just pointless to hope for anything reasonable from them. If you were straight, they wouldn't say you were overstepping.
