Sounds like he\u2019s embarrassed and letting anger take over. \n\nNTA but start asking why he doesn\u2019t follow the directions the gps gives and why he gets upset so easily when you try to help correct him when he doesn\u2019t pay attention to the directions. If he blows up at you and won\u2019t listen and talk, break up with him. He\u2019s not worth the headache.", "YTA. If you are not actually behind the wheel, yet you try to dictate how a drive is to be conducted, makes you a backseat driver. I tell anyone, in a heartbeat, I don't tolerate backseat driving. I offer to pull over and call them an Uber or a cab. Backseat driving can be a distraction, especially if the driver is, as you describe, poor at following directions. He may already feel self-conscious at this shortcoming of a poor sense of direction. I noted he picked a quarrel, not you, about his roundabout route to get to your destination.\n\nTossing around psychological diagnosis such as \"inferiority complex\" by a layman is hurtful and doesn't address the issue at hand.\n\nThe alternative is to do all the driving yourself when you two travel together; or travel separately; or help him -- gently -- improve his use of GPS or other driving tools.", "My brother is like this and it is exhausting. We used to argue all the time about doing the opposite of things you tell him to do and then him being mad when he realizes that his way is more complicated and harder than your way, then him pretending your way was his idea and then doing that completely wrong and then him being mad for not making him do it your way in the first place. Ugh!!! Now I just ignore him and watch him fall into a spin being an idiot by himself", "I'd start driving separately. And then set a timer for how long it takes for him to arrive after she does.", "Nah. Such weirdos always find something to moan about, or they could even get aggressive.\n\nBest to just leave em and wish em all the best in their future endeavors", "At this point I wonder if this man should even be driving. Like does he need drivers ed?!", "Found the sexist.", "Yep. Life's too short to deal with that", "NTA. Your partner sounds exhausting.", "Nta. This is how he\u2019s will react to everything you \u201ccriticize\u201d him on tho. Not worth it", "I\u2019m going against the popular opinion here by saying \n\nYTA\n\nHe\u2019s a grown ass man, you gotta let him make his own mistakes.\n\nBack seat driving is very irritating. You do not know how much you hurt him by doing this. Apparently you did not ask. Admittedly, he\u2019s being a child by lying and not owning his mistakes. This is poor behaviour on his part but does not excuse yours.\n\nAlso, bringing up past mistakes in an argument is about the pettiest thing a person can do. Examine why you do that shit.", "Just let the man make the wrong turn he is trying to drive in silence", "Funnily enough, my mum is the opposite. Even if she has the satnav on, she still wants someone with her to tell her directions/confirm on the screen. \n\nNTA OP but I doubt this is actually about driving...", "Agree, except I'd say ESH. Both are petty as hell.", "I would hate to be so insecure and unable to admit a mistake. How are you supposed to grow, if you do your best to ignore possible mistakes?", "I don't know if it's my ADHD but I often find myself turning left when told to go right, funnily it's never the other way around.", "Telling people the truth is often the right thing to do, and often also the asshole thing to do.\n\nSometimes you feel you gotta be the asshole to make changes.\n\nI\u2019d say backseat driving is an asshole thing to do - and calling someone petty for being angered by it definitely is. That said, if his driving really is that bad, perhaps it is worth talking about it.", "Typical man, always letting his emotions get in charge of his rational decision making. They shouldn\u2019t be allowed to drive. Or vote for that matter.", "How do you know he identifies as male?"]}
