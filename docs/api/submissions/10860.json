He also thinks person 2 was harmless and just trying it on. There are 3 scenarios here.\n\n1) I work in healthcare for those who don\u2019t know MRI safety is a big thing. You always have to do a safety questionnaire before going into the room staff included. I wouldn\u2019t let a male colleague who I didn\u2019t know in the room because he refused to fill in a safety questionnaire. His response was to grab me by the shirt and shove me out the way. (There was no emergency his excuse was he was late for a meeting). I made a complaint.\n\n2) I went out on a young walkers group recently. A man (45?M) wouldn\u2019t leave me alone the entire 5 hour walk. Asked me out 4 times I said no each of the times. Kept trying to hold my hand and put his arm around me. Tried to get my address. When I wouldn\u2019t give it to him told me he would come and find me anyway as he knew near where I lived. Blocked him on FB when he sent a request. Then found me on LinkedIn 2 weeks later. Asked me out again. I said no and told him he was a creep and harassing me. Blocked him. Told the walking group and asked if he could be banned. (Note I never led him on and was actively trying to get away from him the entire walk)\n\n3) At work and a sonographer (38M) who I believe was trying to flirt with me in some weird way. (I had already specifically told him I was not interested in a relationship). Told me about how he could judge if patients are virgins when they come in the room by their appearance. And whether or not he should do a trans vaginal scan. Told him this was out of order and unprofessional. Made a complaint about him. \n\nAnyway AITA?", "created_utc": 1677321526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bi1h7/aita_for_calling_out_these_men/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It firmly places their rights to misbehave above those of past and present victims.", "WTF, NTA in any of these scenarios. All these guys are creeps and your dad\u2019s a dick.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nOk, so we don't know you. Therefore, we can't say whether you are doing something you don't understand that is inviting this unwanted attention. When in was your age, stuff like this happened to me too-- Strangers approaching and attempting to speak to and touch me. I learned to smile a lot less and not look people in the eye that I don't want to speak to.  Basically, I learned to look mean. Sucks but it's true. \n\n1. Seems pretty straightforward case of workplace battery, and this guy refused to follow the rules. Definitely reporting it was the right thing to do. He had no business touching you. \n\n2. I think you handled that correctly, too, although, I would have found a way to leave the event after the second instance of him asking me out. He definitely needs to be banned from the group if he is refusing to take no for an answer. \n\n3. Also correctly handled. What a creepy thing for a man to say about his female patients. Totally unprofessional. He should not be treating women. \n\nYou are strong. Stay well versed in professional procedures and STICK to them. No one can fault you for following policy.  It will protect your job. Seek out a female mentor. Perhaps there is a professional association you could join? A female relative or therapist who has good advice?", "NTA. Their behavior is appalling. They need a good lesson.", "NTA, and your dad should be more protective of you. \n\n1. No one, man or woman, should ever lay their hands on ANYONE.

Please carry a taser or pepper spray if you don\u2019t already because it sounds like he would find you no matter what. \n\n3. Men who work in obstetrics and gynecology already make many women uncomfortable by simply being a man, the fact that he so openly said that to you, as a woman, makes me seriously question what he may be comfortable with telling a male coworker that he wasn\u2019t comfortable saying to you. If I found out my doctor said something like that I would be livid. You absolutely can not tell if a woman is a virgin by looking at her, and transvaginal ultrasounds can be uncomfortable both physically and mentally. If he is basing a medical decision/procedure solely on the fact that he thinks a woman \u201clooks\u201d like she\u2019s not a virgin has to be some kind of malpractice.", "NTA and you dealt with these men perfectly!!!", "NTA on all counts. \n\n\\#2 needs to be reported to the police and the other 2 need to be reported to HR. \n\nAnd your dad needs a wake up call.", "NTA, these men are wretched human beings", "NTA you are entitled to a workplace free of harassment.

You were right to make complaints-I work in healthcare too, and it can be stressful and busy but that doesn't give anyone the right to put their hands on a colleague. And as for the safety questionnaire-hospitals run on protocols, which can be annoying and frustrating, but  they're for good reasons. Failing to follow correct protocols is a disciplinary offence in its own right, never mind the assault. That comment about virgins is also highly unprofessional and could constitute harassment, and its impossible to tell who is a virgin just by looking anyway, even if he was looking at their hymen at the time. For your father to diminish the impact these interactions have had on you is dismissive,  unsupportive and uncaring. In my opinion, dealing with them by following the chain of command and making a complaint IS dealing with it without making a fuss, your dad is talking rubbish.", "Nta on all 3", "Umm reporting sexual harrassment is not 'causing a fuss'. Would you not report a murder because 'oh I didnt want to trouble the police' What nonsense!!\n\nYour dad is the AH\nYou are doing good work.", "NTA. \n\nIt really sucks that you went through these scenarios... I'm sorry to hear that. \n\n\nAll 3 scenarios are well dealt with.

Stay safe OP.", "NTA\n49 Australian guy here, dad to a 3 year old girl.\n\n\n1. Safety issue, he should never have grabbed you like that. Thats assault.\n\n\n2. Nope thats sounding like sexual harrassment to me. What would've happened if you got seperated from the group with him? Just a bit of harmless fun hey love (sarcasm). Bad situation that couldve..would've got nasty. Damn right to block and get him banned. Would dad have liked hearing the words \"dad, i've been raped'?\n\n\n3.

Good on you for making a complaint, it's important that this behavior goes on record. \nYour father, however, is a d|ck for excusing sexual harassment and being unsafe in the workplace (especially in the medical field, safety always comes first). If this has happened before I would consider going NC/LC, but that is up to you.", "NTA and good for you for calling out all three of those men. Your dad is wrong about person 2 and you did the right thing. It is really concerning that your dad thinks it was \u201charmless\u201d, though.  Your young walking group should ban him, since he wouldn\u2019t leave you alone or take no for an answer. If they decide not to, I\u2019d go to get a restraining order because him saying he knew where you lived and would come find you. For all we know you are not the first woman who filed a complaint, if there are others piling up you should add your voice (and a paper trail).\n\nStay strong and don\u2019t ever let anyone minimize things if you don\u2019t feel safe. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA and now you know what type of man your father is.", "Nta and you did the right things..", "Your father doesn't see anything wrong with that?

You were 1) physically assaulted, 2) harassed, and 3) protecting patients from a creeper - in all of these situations, there was no excessive concern. There was the *correct* amount of concern considering that you were *assaulted* and *harassed*.\n\nYour dad has internalized misogyny (most people in our society do) and because of that, he assumes that women should accept the treatment they are given because surely it\u2019s \u201cnot that bad\u201d. Does your dad know that 1/2 women have been either sexually or physically assaulted? What does he think you should do if you\u2019re raped? Roll over and not make a fuss?? \n\nI\u2019m so sick of people telling us to accept the shitty treatment we\u2019re receiving. Don\u2019t listen to him and don\u2019t stop standing up for yourself (and your patients).
