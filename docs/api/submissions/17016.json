Is it a thing to have a baby shower for subsequent kids I thought people only did it for their 1st?", "NTA \n\nIt seems to me like they just want you to throw them a shower for free, and have you pay for everything. They\u2019re taking advantage of your generosity", "NTA. At least where I'm from, you get one baby shower. The point of the shower is to help the new parents get the supplies they need. Aside from diapers, they should already have everything for their 2nd baby.\n\nI'll usually send a small gift in the mail if it's a close friend or family but asking for a second shower would be considered tacky in my circle.", "NTA.\n\nBaby showers are for the first child. Not for the second, or any subsequent children.\n\nMy experience has been that new moms get a baby shower. You don't get new shit for each kid, that's how hand-me-downs work.", "You don't \"ask\" someone to host your party and pay all the expenses associated with the party, do you? What fresh Hades is this I just fell into?\n\nA gift has to come from a giver, and unfortunately you aren't feeling like giving right now. If you'd volunteered at least, I could see your SIL accepting?\n\nOMG. This is hilariously ridiculous to me. Anyone who wants a second baby shower is certainly entitled to have one. But, they can host the party themselves at their home and be gift grabby as they want to be if they invite guests.\n\nNTA. Who does this?", "NTA - \n\nNext time your BIL \"mentions\" it to your husband say \"we'd love to come, let us know where it's going to be\". \n\nOr just be direct and say you were happy to help the first time but cannot afford to do it again, and it's someone else's turn to host.", "NTA. Baby showers are typically for someone's first child, because brand new parents aren't going to have a lot of things, such as a crib, car seat, stroller, changing table, clothes, etc. etc. When they have their second, they will likely still have a lot of that stuff if they were planning to have multiple children in a relatively short timeframe (<5 years apart). I could understand a justification if the kids would be 10+ years apart (my stepdad and his brother have a 16-yr age gap), as safety practices change, and things what were considered good 5 years ago wouldn't be good enough now.", "NTA\n\nIf they want a full-on shower, they can throw that for themselves (why not since they're already going to be tacky af for the second shower anyway?).  You certainly are not obligated to eat this expense for every kid they have.\n\nIf you want to keep the peace though, my circle of friends does things for every baby, but we only go all out for the first.  For subsequent kids, we do smaller things like a backyard BBQ potluck where you bring a dish and a pack of diapers or a \"sprinkle\" where everyone gets either diapers or a new outfit for the baby.  Just stuff hosted casually at someone's house where the cost is spread out, but everyone has a good time and the expecting parents still get support.  Sure you're not getting fancy registry gifts, but you get a mountain of diapers which is massively helpful.", "NTA.  Most people get one baby shower, first baby.  You and your husband don't owe them anything.  They sound problematic in many of their familial relationships.  And the way they treat you and your husband when you want to get together is thoughtless, rude and disrepectful.  Send em a nice gift from their registry and call it good.  Don't feel bad.  They are TAs!", "NTA, second babies this close generally do not get a shower, especially same sex. You can do a sprinkle, which is diapers, wipes, etc. The consumables that they won't have on hand for a newborn.  But a full on shower?  They should still have their baby stuff, so no.", "NTA\n\nBaby showers are traditionally only held for the first baby as it is a means for new parents to get gifts related to being first time parents. It is completely appropriate to only hold one & to just offer to get gifts privately for any additional children.", "NTA. Generally showers are for the first baby. Then a smaller \"sprinkle\" is sometimes thrown for the 2nd baby, especially if it's of a different gender or there's many years between the previous and newer baby.", "NTA. From a man who has never been to a baby shower and probably will never go to one, do people usually have multiple showers? Or is it usually just one baby shower for your first baby? Because if they're the same gender, a lot of the stuff they used clothing and toy wise should be able to just go to the next one, no?", "NTA\n\nI don't think you need to fully pay for another person's baby shower.", "NTA, baby showers can get expensive and I guess I'm more traditional in that you can expect to have one for your first baby only. No judgement either way just my opinion.", "NTA.  Doesn\u2019t she have family and friends??", "NTA\n\nHosting a shower is up to the host. Don't feel pressured. There are options to the big showers. \n\nPerhaps contact the girlfriend and talk to her about setting up a lower key baby shower since they already have all the essentials. \n\nOr even a hybrid mommy/baby shower is a thing, especially after the first baby. Generally, the ladies meet for a mani/pedi, and go to lunch where there is a gift exchange. All the guests split the costs of the services and lunch, including paying for the guest of honor. \n\nIt's your money and your time, don't feel guilty for putting your family first.", "NTA... cant expect a big shower every time they have a baby especially if they cant afford it.... you and your husband have your own bills  and what not...", "NTA\n\nReally you don't have to have an excuse.\nI don't feel like it . Is good enough.\nIt's a lot of work and if you don't share the responsibility & expenses with others it's just not in you time/money budget.\nIt's ok to say you are not free for it this time and let them sort it out.", "Though no one pays attention to this any longer, relatives should not be throwing showers (bridal, baby, or otherwise), period. It ought to be assumed that family will help outfit young parents. It is friends who should be showering the family. And second showers are just not on.

Unless the next kid is a different sex or on the rare occasions that there\u2019s a significant age gap between the last kid and new baby. Like 10 years. Other than that, you get one shower. I\u2019ve noticed this with different cultures too.", "NTA.  Baby showers are for the first kid only.\nSuper tacky to have one for second kid.  Especially only three years later", "You don\u2019t have a shower for baby #2. \n\nNTA.", "You don\u2019t do a second shower?
