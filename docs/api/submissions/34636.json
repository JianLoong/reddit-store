It will likely be very little.\n\n\nMy older son\u2019s wife\u2019s family is of equal (if not more) wealth to us and provide for their daughter without hesitation. As such we have not given them much help since it was never needed. This DIL is not only an only child but the single member of her family in that generation. She is set to inherit from a half dozen estates as the last living relative. They also do not plan on having children. \n\n\nOur wills, written before either was married, were originally equal splits. With how things have gone we feel we should leave the majority to our younger. They will get next to nothing from his wife\u2019s family and have children of their own to support. My older son will inherit more than enough from his wife\u2019s side to equal out.\n\n\nWe were talking about this with some friends and they said to be prepared to cause tension by treating our sons differently.

It's your money but your son will probably resent you for this. His wife is set to inherit, he's not. So if anything happens to them, he's out in the cold.

I understand your reasoning,  but this is an issue he causing himself.", "Look it's your money and your choice *but* you're enabling your less successful son and rewarding him  by not only carrying and funding his choices In life but also in death. \n\nThey chose to have kids they cant afford. because they know that you'll fund their choices. \n\nMaybe he's not trying to improve his circumstances because he knows that you'll just be there to prop them up?\n\nIt hits a point where it doesn't matter that you're richer and the in laws are poorer, your kids are adults, they should be funding their own lives. \n\nI get your friends POV", "Lol. I legit thought you were going to give more to the other son to make up for favoring the son that keeps having kids he can\u2019t afford but nope you are just going to continue to favor the irresponsible one. YTA", "NAH\n\nBut consider that in many places, your son's wife's inheritance will be considered *her separate property*.  It is not automatically property of her spouse, even in communal property states.  That means she would have every right to deny him access to it, and if they divorced, it would not be a part of their marital estate if she kept it separate.  In addition, if she predeceases her parents, they may pass it elsewhere, completely bypassing your son entirely.\n\nSo there is NO guarantee your son will ever get his wife's inheritance.  And sure you can say \"Well, if any of that happened, we'd update the will\".  Lots of people say that, and lots of people forget to update their wills until it's too late.  \n\nChoosing to give someone a lesser inheritance because they chose not to have children is also something that is likely to ruffle feathers and hurt feelings.  Honestly, if you want to provide for your grandchildren, I would suggest doing so directly.  Portion for each grandkid, and then equal split between the siblings.  This also leads to a better split if your grandkids reach adulthood before you pass, in that event it goes directly to them instead of going to someone who may or may not pass it along to them.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's up to you how you want to do it.", "YTA\n\nYou have a golden child and you will have a golden child after you die.

Because, you have no business expecting the stable son to care for you in your old age. Although, I bet you will. The screw up can care for you or the stable one can dump you in a random, Medicaid nursing home. You can\u2019t take anything from the kid you are screwing over. If you do, you are more than just an asshole.", "YTA I hope you do know that inheritance is never marital property. If your older son divorces his wife he gets nothing from the wife's inheritance.

Tell him what you are considering and why, and reassure him that what you are considering has nothing to do with amounts of love, merely an evaluation of need.\n\nHe might say no problem, he agrees he needs less. He might say that while he understands how you are seeing things, all that money you are looking at belongs to his wife\u2019s side of the family and he would feel safer with his own cushion. Be careful not to make him feel guilty if he doesn\u2019t want to just hand everything to his brother, but if he is willing, then there\u2019s no problem.", "YTA\n\nNot only will your son resent you but its likely to create a rift between the siblings.

Why are you rewarding your younger son for making poor life choices (having children they cannot afford at such a young age)?", "YTA if you do this without talking to your sons.  It could end up creating a sense of resentment/shame and ruin their long-term relationship.  \n\nYour older son might feel he\u2019s being punished for marrying into a financially stable family and he and his wife\u2019s decision not to have children.  Also, you don\u2019t know what the marriage dynamic is like between the two of them and how it might change if they find out that you left them less because they were going to get money from her side.  It could make your older son feel like he\u2019s a free-rider.  Also, it might seem like they\u2019re doing better financially, but they might also have higher expenses.  One never knows what the situation is.\n\nConversely, your younger son might not feel comfortable about getting something that was supposed to go to his older brother.  Would your younger son and his wife still be able to hold their heads high when they meet up with your older son and his wife?  \n\nFirst, talk to your older son.  If he\u2019s ok with it, then talk to your younger son.  Make sure everyone\u2019s comfortable with your plan.\n\nOne idea is to give equally to the sons, but set aside separate funds for each grandchild.  That way, no one can claim that they\u2019re being treated unfairly.", "No, you are definitely major assholes for this.  I can see it now.  You change your will.  You both die and leave your older son very little.  His wife has some sort of family drama that ends with her being taken out of the will completely.  How do you feel about that scenario?  Or, how about this one.  His wife's parents have another child.  That child's wife comes from an extremely poor family and will be left nothing by them.  So her parents give her share of their inheritance to the other sister since you guys will leave them something.  Sound shitty?  It is.  \n\nYou're playing favorites with your children and masquerading it as critical reasoning.  My two scenarios above are hypothetical.  You know what isn't?  The hurt and pain of feeling less loved by his parents that will exist in his heart until the day he dies.  YTA", "Do not do this. You will build huge resentment between your children as Wills are often seen to reflect love even if that\u2019s not the intention.  \n\nYou are relying on one child staying married to their (richer family) partner and relying on that family to provide for your child. \n\nWhy not help your poorer child out a bit now if you feel they need it.", "YTA. Inheritances are of course yours to decide. But please don\u2019t underestimate the symbolism. \n\nGifts to one son who needs money during a rough time is one thing. Leaving your resources to your two sons is different, symbolically. \n\nInheritances are final gifts from loving parents to equally-loved children. One DIL\u2019s financial prospects have nothing to do with that son. Those are her resources, not community property. \n\nYour son deserves equal consideration for resources that will be his alone, not shared marital property. They may leave him free to start a business, get a Ph.D., bless a wonderful charity: in other words, independence. \n\nThe other son deserves no more because he procreated. \n\nThis is like businesses that pay a man more than a woman because he might be the breadwinner someday.

Your rationale is fine, although it may cause some strife between the brothers. \n\nHowever, you should consider all of the following before you make changes:\n\n1. Who will provide the majority of your elder care? Your younger son is already caring for 4 children. \n\n2. You said you \"cover quite a bit\".

Obviously a single adult will have fewer needs than a father, so it depends on what a majority of assets means.\n\n4.

If your sons are older your \u201cwealthy\u201d son may not have an issue with this if he feels he doesn\u2019t need the money and was consulted. In our family there are on going discussions about inheritance especially as we age because at some point it\u2019s worth skipping a generation for tax reasons.

It\u2019s entirely possible that your older son harbors resentment about how much assistance your provide his brother, because he sees it as you essentially punishing him for making more responsible choices than his brother did and being self-sufficient. Of course, it\u2019s also entirely possible that your older son will agree with your reasoning. You won\u2019t know until you talk to him about it. \n\nThe other thing you should consider is your plans for your twilight years. Who do you expect will care for you, and will that responsibility fall equally between your two sons?

Is that fair?\n\nIf you tell your sons your plans, be prepared for LOTS of tension, both between your older son and you and between your older son and younger son.

Lets highlight a few big ones:\n\n1.  The estate plan you\u2019re contemplating can basically only have two outcomes: you create dissension, if you are over thinking it. Here is what I mean. Possibility A is that your older son cares that he is not being treated equally and that you are favoring his brother in your estate plan. If that is how your son feels, your parting gift to him in death is going to be making him feel like you care about his brother more (if you don\u2019t explain this all to him beforehand) and/or creating if a division between the brothers, who will then be left with no parent and a bad relationship with their sibling, meaning you will have shattered the family you and your husband built. Possibility B is that your older son does not care, or agree with you. In that case, you could have gotten the exact same result by simply talking to him beforehand, and saying \u201clook, we don\u2019t know what the future will bring, so we are going to leave the money evenly between both of you, but I\u2019d when dad and I pass you don\u2019t need the money, but your brother does, our wishes are that you disclaim x percent of your inheritance to help your brother out (unless you cannot do this for tax reasons, which should only matter if you\u2019re estate is truely massive). So either you\u2019re creating a rift with your plan, or you don\u2019t need this plan to get what you want, you just need to talk to your oldest son. Either way, your contemplated plan will accomplish no good.\n\n2.  You\u2019re glossing over the fact that you\u2019re already already giving the younger son future inheritance, minimizing the difference in how much you are really planning to treat your kids differently. You say you say you \u201calready cover quit a bit\u201d for younger son, and \u201chave not given [older son] much because it isn\u2019t needed.\u201d So basically younger son gets more during your life, and then still more at your death? When you came up with this plan to favor your younger son, did you even bother to figure out how much you would likely be skewing to him in the end once you count support during your life on top? I bet not.\n\n3. You\u2019re basing part of your logic on assumptions about OTHeR PEOPLE\u2019S estate plans that, I\u2019m willing to bet anything, you haven\u2019t seen. You say your DiL is the \u201csingle member of that generation\u201d and will this inherit from a half dozen estates. Do you know she will inherit from these estates, or are you assuming it? I\u2019m not aware of aunts and uncles and the like openly talking inheritance with their relatives, let alone their relatives in-laws. How are you so confident all of these relations won\u2019t be leaving most or all of their estates to, say, their nieces and nephews from their spouse\u2019s side, their spouses siblings, or (if they don\u2019t have spouses) close friends, charities, or people who have assisted them in life? I suspect that answer is you don\u2019t, your just assuming she will inherit from all of those folks because the assumption makes you feel better if your plan to treat your kids unequally.\n\n4. You have no idea if your son will get divorced between your death and his wife inheriting. It\u2019s entirely possible this could happen, totally eliminating one of the foundational premises you are relying on. \n\n5. Do you know for certain your older son will\nNever have kids (which his current or any future wife)? The kids thing seems to\nMatter to you, but it isn\u2019t clear you\u2019ve contemplated how that circumstance might change in the next 20 years. \n\n6. You have better options. I noted in No. 1 that starting by talking to your older son would have been preferable to just making the new plan and not having a conversation with him about why you are doing this and what you want to see if maybe this is a non-issue. More than that though, if your goal is to help provide for your grandkids, just do that directly. Why are you subsidizing your younger son\u2019s financial recklessness (having more kids than they can afford and, apparently, living above his financial means in a way that requires your periodic help?
