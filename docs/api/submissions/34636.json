I understand your reasoning,  but this is an issue he causing himself.", "Look it's your money and your choice *but* you're enabling your less successful son and rewarding him  by not only carrying and funding his choices In life but also in death. \n\nThey chose to have kids they cant afford. because they know that you'll fund their choices. \n\nMaybe he's not trying to improve his circumstances because he knows that you'll just be there to prop them up?\n\nIt hits a point where it doesn't matter that you're richer and the in laws are poorer, your kids are adults, they should be funding their own lives. \n\nI get your friends POV", "Lol. I legit thought you were going to give more to the other son to make up for favoring the son that keeps having kids he can\u2019t afford but nope you are just going to continue to favor the irresponsible one. YTA", "NAH\n\nBut consider that in many places, your son's wife's inheritance will be considered *her separate property*.  It is not automatically property of her spouse, even in communal property states.  That means she would have every right to deny him access to it, and if they divorced, it would not be a part of their marital estate if she kept it separate.  In addition, if she predeceases her parents, they may pass it elsewhere, completely bypassing your son entirely.\n\nSo there is NO guarantee your son will ever get his wife's inheritance.  And sure you can say \"Well, if any of that happened, we'd update the will\".  Lots of people say that, and lots of people forget to update their wills until it's too late.  \n\nChoosing to give someone a lesser inheritance because they chose not to have children is also something that is likely to ruffle feathers and hurt feelings.  Honestly, if you want to provide for your grandchildren, I would suggest doing so directly.  Portion for each grandkid, and then equal split between the siblings.  This also leads to a better split if your grandkids reach adulthood before you pass, in that event it goes directly to them instead of going to someone who may or may not pass it along to them.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's up to you how you want to do it.", "YTA\n\nYou have a golden child and you will have a golden child after you die.

Because, you have no business expecting the stable son to care for you in your old age. Although, I bet you will. The screw up can care for you or the stable one can dump you in a random, Medicaid nursing home. You can\u2019t take anything from the kid you are screwing over. If you do, you are more than just an asshole.", "YTA I hope you do know that inheritance is never marital property. If your older son divorces his wife he gets nothing from the wife's inheritance.

Tell him what you are considering and why, and reassure him that what you are considering has nothing to do with amounts of love, merely an evaluation of need.\n\nHe might say no problem, he agrees he needs less. He might say that while he understands how you are seeing things, all that money you are looking at belongs to his wife\u2019s side of the family and he would feel safer with his own cushion. Be careful not to make him feel guilty if he doesn\u2019t want to just hand everything to his brother, but if he is willing, then there\u2019s no problem.", "YTA\n\nNot only will your son resent you but its likely to create a rift between the siblings.

Why are you rewarding your younger son for making poor life choices (having children they cannot afford at such a young age)?", "YTA if you do this without talking to your sons.  It could end up creating a sense of resentment/shame and ruin their long-term relationship.  \n\nYour older son might feel he\u2019s being punished for marrying into a financially stable family and he and his wife\u2019s decision not to have children.  Also, you don\u2019t know what the marriage dynamic is like between the two of them and how it might change if they find out that you left them less because they were going to get money from her side.  It could make your older son feel like he\u2019s a free-rider.  Also, it might seem like they\u2019re doing better financially, but they might also have higher expenses.  One never knows what the situation is.\n\nConversely, your younger son might not feel comfortable about getting something that was supposed to go to his older brother.  Would your younger son and his wife still be able to hold their heads high when they meet up with your older son and his wife?  \n\nFirst, talk to your older son.  If he\u2019s ok with it, then talk to your younger son.  Make sure everyone\u2019s comfortable with your plan.\n\nOne idea is to give equally to the sons, but set aside separate funds for each grandchild.  That way, no one can claim that they\u2019re being treated unfairly.", "No, you are definitely major assholes for this.  I can see it now.  You change your will.  You both die and leave your older son very little.  His wife has some sort of family drama that ends with her being taken out of the will completely.  How do you feel about that scenario?  Or, how about this one.  His wife's parents have another child.  That child's wife comes from an extremely poor family and will be left nothing by them.  So her parents give her share of their inheritance to the other sister since you guys will leave them something.  Sound shitty?  It is.  \n\nYou're playing favorites with your children and masquerading it as critical reasoning.  My two scenarios above are hypothetical.  You know what isn't?  The hurt and pain of feeling less loved by his parents that will exist in his heart until the day he dies.  YTA", "Do not do this. You will build huge resentment between your children as Wills are often seen to reflect love even if that\u2019s not the intention.  \n\nYou are relying on one child staying married to their (richer family) partner and relying on that family to provide for your child. \n\nWhy not help your poorer child out a bit now if you feel they need it.", "YTA. Inheritances are of course yours to decide. But please don\u2019t underestimate the symbolism. \n\nGifts to one son who needs money during a rough time is one thing. Leaving your resources to your two sons is different, symbolically. \n\nInheritances are final gifts from loving parents to equally-loved children. One DIL\u2019s financial prospects have nothing to do with that son. Those are her resources, not community property. \n\nYour son deserves equal consideration for resources that will be his alone, not shared marital property. They may leave him free to start a business, get a Ph.D., bless a wonderful charity: in other words, independence. \n\nThe other son deserves no more because he procreated. \n\nThis is like businesses that pay a man more than a woman because he might be the breadwinner someday.

Your rationale is fine, although it may cause some strife between the brothers. \n\nHowever, you should consider all of the following before you make changes:\n\n1. Who will provide the majority of your elder care? Your younger son is already caring for 4 children. \n\n2. You said you \"cover quite a bit\".

Obviously a single adult will have fewer needs than a father, so it depends on what a majority of assets means.\n\n4.

If your sons are older your \u201cwealthy\u201d son may not have an issue with this if he feels he doesn\u2019t need the money and was consulted. In our family there are on going discussions about inheritance especially as we age because at some point it\u2019s worth skipping a generation for tax reasons.

It\u2019s entirely possible that your older son harbors resentment about how much assistance your provide his brother, because he sees it as you essentially punishing things for making responsible choices. Of course, it\u2019s also entirely possible that your older son will agree with your reasoning. You won\u2019t know until you talk to him about it. \n\nThe other thing you should consider is your plans for your twilight years. Will that responsibility fall equally between your two sons?

A lawyer and/or tax planner would be best placed to advise on the various options.

Your older son will get less/nothing from your will simply because his wife will inherit more.  Is that fair?\n\nIf you tell your sons your plans, be prepared for LOTS of tension, both between your older son and you and between your older son and younger son.

What you are doing now smells a lot like you trying to maintain a false sense of equality instead of committing a final act of parenting -- showing them *both* that they are equally loved and valued. **YTA.**", "Whilst it is your will and you can do whatever you wish, you're solely basing this on both your sons partners, which I don't think is wise. You should look at your sons individual wealth too.\nAnything could happen. What if your oldest gets divorced and is no longer with that wife. What if oldest sons' wife family loose their wealth, etc.\nAlso, I believe inheritance is not part of marriage assests.  So even if the oldest sons wife does have a large inheritance, your oldest can not go after this and won't have it to lean on if they divorce.\n\nYou should have a chat with both sons about this. It would be a huge slap in the face if you didn't.", "Yta his *wife* is going to inherit, not him.  In lots of places, inheritance is not a marital asset.  Also, you're *already* giving one son more financial help, and now you want to leave them even more? To continue financing their bad decisions??? They can't afford 3 kids, so they have a 4th?  How about you buy them condoms and a vasectomy appt?", "Yta", "Could you leave something for your grandkids, to be given to them when they reach a certain age? College funds?", "YTA. You should treat them equally. The less responsible son (having so many kids you have to help out) should not be rewarded with more money. Plus, inheritances don't get split in the event of a divorce. \n\nYou should also split it evenly if you want them to get along after your death. If you don't make it equal, there may be resentment or even lawsuits in the works.", "Let me phrase it this way\u2026.. YTA \u2026 If you don\u2019t talk to your sons and for seeing your DILs inheritance as yours sons. You should sit your sons down and talk with them. My question is why your youngest has so many issues but still get kids instead of working on getting in stable water? And why should your oldest be kind of punished for his decisions? Yes it\u2019s your money and you should help him if he is in trouble but when you die and he inherits at some point it will be gone, it\u2019s not an endless resources and what then?! When parents die and you are lucky having siblings with good relationships you\u2018ll never be alone (my grandma said this) but if you do this it can be the end of it because one of them will feel neglected and will resent his brother for it instead of helping him. Your oldest is the only one left who could help him and It's not helpful to offend your child like that. Talk with them, help your youngest now, splitt everything 50/50 and I\u2019m sure your oldest will help his brother in times of need. What you although should do is sit your youngest down and help him to help himself and have a talk about BC because in this situation he should be responsible and stop having kids till he can afford and can take care of them on their own. Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "unfortunately YTA\u2014that inheritance is from you & your wife to your children. you never stipulated that their partner\u2019s wealth would change the split. one would hope your children have a good enough relationship that the \u201cwealthier\u201d son would take a smaller cut and give more to his bro. but now there\u2019s a possibility your sons will have an issue with each other", "YTA the wife\u2019s inheritance will be hers not your sons. You are babying you kid because he is irresponsible and keeps reproducing when he can\u2019t take care of the kids he has. You are being completely unfair to you other son just because his wife come from wealth. Maybe they will donate all their money and she gets none. It\u2019s just the principle of it all that is unfair. You can\u2019t justify this favoritism. Your money your choice but if you", "YTA. At least talk to them while you're still around - if you're going to play favorites, at least have the guts to say it to their faces instead of letting them find out once you're gone.", "YTA. As a childless person who never asks for help from my parents and is married to someone whose parents will likely leave us a fair chunk of change, it\u2019s a slap in face for being independent. And also? My siblings children will inherit my estate so it trickles down. It smacks of favoritism not fairness.", "YTA!  If you can\u2019t see that, then your younger son has always been the favored child and your friends probably know this", "I second this. If anything should happen to older son's wife (she dies before her relatives), he will inherit nothing while your younger son gets it all. If your older son's marriage ends in divorce, he will not be entitled to her inheritance and, as you left him with nothing, he will not get his own. \n\nYou are being short-sighted and letting your older son know that you haven\u2019t put in the thought for his future. It\u2019s an insult for that alone but the message you\u2019re sending your sons is that you only want to support the one who has more children than he can afford and requires constant hand-outs. That\u2019s not fair to the one son who has taken nothing from you while an adult.\n\nETA: YTA", "Why the heck are you discussing this with friends? Stop. Right now. Equal split. And don't discuss with anyone.", "Not to mention they have also given more financial help to the younger son already. Definitely going to be some resentment.", "If anything the younger son should get LESS because he\u2019s getting his now. \ud83d\ude44", "I agree with all of this. In fact, there\u2019s an argument that younger brother has already gotten his inheritance while his parent are alive.", "Same. He's already given part of his future inheritance to the younger son, I assumed he'd make it up to the other one in the will, no shaft him some more.", "Excellent answer. I\u2019ve always been of the opinion that someone\u2019s estate is theirs to distribute however they want. But at least in my country, the law is such that one person\u2019s inheritance is not considered part of the marital pool when a couple separates and divides assets.\n\nI\u2019d also caution OP and question how they really know she\u2019d be getting so much? From an outside view I could see why others might think I\u2019d eventually receive a sizeable inheritance however I know for a fact that there\u2019s more debt in my family than wealth. \n\nI love this answer\u2019s suggestion of portioning some money for the grandkids. Make sure the kids are covered without appearing to punish the son who, arguably, made smarter financial decisions (the other son appears to be having kids they can\u2019t afford without his parents\u2019 help).\n\nNAH. Your estate, your decision.", "Best answer.", "I came here to say this. Inheritance is not community property in a marriage. His wife could never share a dime of her inheritance with him.", "This absolutely this have a dialogue about your plans my dad made my uncle that I see the least the \"director?\" Of his will. I feel like he and his family have rather different view point from the rest of our family and now I have no idea what to even make of his will. I'd have loved if he discussed these plans with us his progeny.", "Def an assumption.", "That\u2019s a good point. The older brother might really grow to hate his younger brother.", "I\u2019m curious if the older son will feel like he\u2019s been double shafted because he hasn\u2019t received any \u201chelp\u201d and he might view the reasoning to deny him inheritance a double whammy. He could end up feeling like his brother literally got his inheritance before his parents even passed away and now gets both inheritances. Also wheat if his wife divorces him? Or keeps her own inheritance to herself"]}
