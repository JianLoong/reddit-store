You want to drive alone and go to this cosplay event.  You have talked with people, online, which she doesn't know about.  You are planning on meeting up with these online friends....do you know them in real life, or only online?  You want her to buy your ticket.  She asks to go because, like most mothers, she isn't comfortable with you going on your own (I wouldn't want my 16 yr old doing this either).  You tell her \"no\"\n\nWhat she needs to tell you?  No.  You aren't going.  End of discussion.", "NTA. If a parent wants to be welcome in aspects of their kids' lives that are important, then they have to be a person who it's safe for their kid to be themselves around. Your mom doesn't sound like she knows how to make sure you're really safe, able to be fully yourself and expressive around her. I'm sorry that's the case. You aren't being an asshole, you're protecting yourself and having boundaries.", "Lol my daughter is 19 and I went with her earlier in the year, because she wanted to go and I offered a lift and she paid for my ticket by way of thanks - she was the 13th Doctor and she lent me one of her Doctor who t-shirts to wear. She really enjoyed showing me all that she knew about it and cons and I loved getting to see what she was into. A great day out.\n\nI would also not have let my daughter go alone at 16, so I see your mums point. And also, my daughter always saved up for her own tickets from gift money and she would pay for the train herself. The fact you want your mum to pay yet don\u2019t want her to go sounds pretty ungrateful. YTA", "NTA.\n\nAlso, beeing gay myself, i think you should get a job. Save up money, get the hell out of there ASAP. This is a toxic environment for you, and you will be damaged. \n\nChildren should feel welcome and loved at home. Not hiding an walking on eggshells because of their (sexual) preferences.", "I understand about parents wanting to spend time with their kids, but I feel the context in the two posts here are completely different. Your daughter enjoyed showing you around, whilst OP clearly stated that their mother hated anime and cosplay, and described their personality as clashing against it- such as cosplay.\n\nThis in no way means OP has anything against their mother. I'd describe it more as just not wanting to ignite anything as well as avoiding anything awkward due to a clash of personalities. Plus, it was a choice - OPs mother offered to drive them and go, obviously to brace against it, but it was still a choice. OP just said no, not much wrong with saying no when there is other opportunities out there, both for bonding with mother and for cosplay. Indeed, this potentially avoided all awkwardness between them that this may have spawned.\n\nImma go with NTA."]}
