What did she expect you to do? I guess she'd say your bf could have stayed with him and you come back to the wedding, but hindsight is 20-20 and I don't think anyone should blame a mother for focusing on her unwell child. You could have got some nice photos at the reception instead, if she wasn't so busy wishing you dead...sheesh...\n\nIt's sad that your son is going to miss out on a relationship with his aunt, but that's on her - she's the one who stopped communicating. Absolutely no way should she have access to your son without you or your bf being there - especially if she's using that time to tell him awful things about you.\n\nYour parents are AHs too - they might think they're trying to keep the peace, but they're just enabling your sister's shitty behaviour", "NTA. Aside from the whole issue of her being angry at you and shit talking you to your son, you would have to be insane to trust your child around a person who values their wedding photos over your child's life.", "NTA. My brother is the same way with my family. Fortunately, my kids were old enough to catch on to what he was saying and stopped wanting to be around him pretty quick.", "NTA \n\nYour first responsibility is your child's safety. If his aunt loved him, she would understand that his health comes before her wedding pictures.", "NTA \n\nNo relationship with the parent means no relationship with the child. \n\nThere is also tge risk of her engaging in parental alienation when she is around. You are protecting your son by keeping him away. She does not love him. She does not want what's best for him. (He needed treatment for heat stroke during her wedding,  but was more concerned about yall missing parts of it!!) She is not a safe person.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you want this person around your family?\n\nA heat stroke is no joke. People die and they die fast. She can go suck a lemon.", "NTA and please don\u2019t let your son spend time with her without you present. And if that means she doesn\u2019t get to see him, they\u2019ll both be ok. Your sisters bad behavior is being enabled and rewarded by the people around her, that shit needs to stop and you need to be the one to put a stop to it. There are consequences to being a shitty person, she needs to learn that.", "Your son isn't safe with your sister.  She's willing to allow him to get heat stroke because it's inconvenient for her, what else is she she going to do?  And it's not a question of if, it's when.", "NTA, your sister is messed up. Who the hell would value a wedding picture over a kid\u2019s safety?!", "NTA  You have every right to keep your son away from somebody who doesn't respect you.", "NTA. I can understand being *temporarily* mad about you not being around for the pictures, but if she's *still* angry that you missed the photos *for your son's health,* her priorities are messed up.", "Just a question, why do brides care so much about the photos ? Like in my culture the only picture bride cares about are with the groom. Rest of the family is always busy and you can\u2019t expect everyone to be there.", "NTA\n\nYour son's safety comes first before a wedding. Your sister shouldn't see your son till she changes her attitude towards you and your husband.", "NTA \u2026 for so many reasons!", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t trust my child around someone like her. Also, I\u2019d keep an eye on your parents - the seem dead set on enabling her and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they would let her see him during times when he goes to visit them.", "NTA. I don\u2019t give many people free/unrestricted access to my children. Like, basically no one aside from me and my husband. No one has \u201crights\u201d to your children. I love building relationships between extended family/friends and my kids but your mom is fully wrong. Your child isn\u2019t lacking something from not being allowed to see his aunt without you. It\u2019s very, very reasonable to say grandparents/aunts/uncles can only see children (especially small children) with parents present. If they don\u2019t want to abide by this boundary, that\u2019s their choice about the relationships that are important to them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But honestly, your child is your child and you get to decide who is around them and I\u2019d even question letting your parents be alone with him if they aren\u2019t capable of doing the right thing in a questionable situation when it comes to your sister. It\u2019s ok to not have contact with some family members if they are toxic, my sister is very toxic and very manipulative and I cut her out of my life in 2017 and have never regretted it.", "So they are willing to loose relationship with you and grandchild to appease her.", "Losing her is not ok, but potentially losing you is?"]}
