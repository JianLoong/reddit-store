What did she expect you to do? I guess she'd say your bf could have stayed with him and you come back to the wedding, but hindsight is 20-20 and I don't think anyone should blame a mother for focusing on her unwell child. You could have got some nice photos at the reception instead, if she wasn't so busy wishing you dead...sheesh...\n\nIt's sad that your son is going to miss out on a relationship with his aunt, but that's on her - she's the one who stopped communicating. Absolutely no way should she have access to your son without you or your bf being there - especially if she's using that time to tell him awful things about you.\n\nYour parents are AHs too - they might think they're trying to keep the peace, but they're just enabling your sister's shitty behaviour", "NTA. Aside from the whole issue of her being angry at you and shit talking you to your son, you would have to be insane to trust your child around a person who values their wedding photos over your child's life.", "NTA. My brother is the same way with my family.

You are protecting your son by keeping him away. She does not love him. She does not want what's best for him. (He needed treatment for heat stroke during her wedding,  but was more concerned about yall missing parts of it!!) She is not a safe person.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you want this person around your family?\n\nA heat stroke is no joke. People die and they die fast. She can go suck a lemon.", "NTA and please don\u2019t let your son spend time with her without you present. And if that means she doesn\u2019t get to see him, they\u2019ll both be ok.

There are consequences to being a shitty person, she needs to learn that.", "Your son isn't safe with your sister.  She's willing to allow him to get heat stroke because it's inconvenient for her, what else is she she going to do?  And it's not a question of if, it's when.", "NTA, your sister is messed up.

But honestly, your child is your child and you get to decide who is around them and I\u2019d even question letting your parents be alone with him if they aren\u2019t capable of doing the right thing in a questionable situation when it comes to your sister.

People who expect to not make things right with parents yet have access to their kids are NOT safe people", "NTA It doesn\u2019t get anymore straightforward than this situation. You probably won\u2019t see it for what it is because even to you her behavior has been normalized to a certain extent over a lifetime of exposure. You even said it yourself, your family not being overly shocked and basically apathetic to it. Look up narcissistic abuse among family members. I\u2019m betting your sib has exhibited more covert behaviors where you and family had to walk on eggshells, and never truly took responsibility for her actions and behaviors your whole life with moments of openly malignant outbursts(wedding photo scenario). Hopefully you\u2019ll open your eyes now and make some hard decisions. But if you aren\u2019t there yet, give it time. The narcissist is nothing if not predictable. Something else will happen to set your sib off and the whole cycle will start over again.  The fact that you are even questioning yourself over this should be a big red flag for you and your family", "NTA.\n\n1. She was apparently perfectly happy and willing to risk the life of your toddler so that she could get the pictures she wanted.

Your mom is an enabler.\n\nGo no-contact with both of them, neither deserve anything from you until they profusely apologize *and* make amends to do better. It\u2019s honestly ridiculous that you\u2019re allowing this to continue, and I\u2019m close to saying ESH because you could be putting your child in danger by being around her, and you\u2019re also enabling this horrid behavior.", "NTA Why are you still in contact with any of these people, your sister sounds absolutely vile and your parents enable her.  Cut contact with them all and you\u2019ll quickly realise how much better off you are mentally.", "NTA\n\nYou need to go no contact with your sister. And you need to ego LC with your mom and dad.

That is messed up. I\u2019m not sure why you ever allowed her to see your son without you after she prioritized her pictures over his safety. Cut her off. Simply say you will not allow your son to spend time with someone who hates his parents and talks badly about them. Tell your mom even though it is hurtful, you respect her decision to not intervene; this is between you and your sister. And not intervening means really staying out of it 100%.

Be prepared for things to intensify once she realizes her tactics are not working.  Or she may take a different approach to get her foot in the door.  Look up the acronym DARVO. It\u2019ll help you recognize the stages or part of the process she will use to get you back under her control. Once you are no longer an option for scapegoat, she will turn on one of her \u201cflying monkeys\u201d and everything you tried to tell them about this will eventually bring them back to you and sanity. (So to speak).  So be strong. Stand your ground not just for your child but for yourself. You are protecting your immediate family from toxicity."]}
