You could have got some nice photos at the reception instead, if she wasn't so busy wishing you dead...sheesh...\n\nIt's sad that your son is going to miss out on a relationship with his aunt, but that's on her - she's the one who stopped communicating. Absolutely no way should she have access to your son without you or your bf being there - especially if she's using that time to tell him awful things about you.\n\nYour parents are AHs too - they might think they're trying to keep the peace, but they're just enabling your sister's shitty behaviour", "NTA.

I\u2019m betting your sib has exhibited more covert behaviors where you and family had to walk on eggshells, and never truly took responsibility for her actions and behaviors your whole life with moments of openly malignant outbursts(wedding photo scenario). Hopefully you\u2019ll open your eyes now and make some hard decisions. But if you aren\u2019t there yet, give it time. The narcissist is nothing if not predictable.

NTA", "NTA I would never let my children be around let alone spend extended periods of time with someone who openly hates me and my spouse, you don\u2019t owe your sister or family anything. Letting someone have access to YOUR kids but they hate you is super wild and for your parents to think it\u2019s ok is delusional.", "NTA. You need to go low contact with your parents and NC with your sister. You're also allowing your son to see that behavior and think that it is acceptable.", "NTA have you read the \u201cDon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d post? It seems similar to your situation. I\u2019ll find it\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1", "NTA. Your sister is absolutely in the wrong over what happened at the wedding. No logical person would argue this. It's understandable entirely that it hurt your feelings. \n\nIs there a chance for cordial reconciliation? It's not just your feelings anymore but also your son's. Don't let the sibling rivalry spill into the child. He's very peseptive. \n\nAt this point the only redeeming quality you even see in your sister is that she loves your nephew. Maybe you want to sever it away and she won't have to be considered a tolerable person anymore. It is your choice to do that but it comes with the price of your son being reduced like a bargaining chip or a punishment to hold over her head and stab at her conscious. Even if I thought she deserved that I don't think your son does. He doesn't need anymore misdirected bitterness whether it came from her or accidentally from you.", "Nta , heat stroke kills. Especially dangerous in young children.  We used to use the mantra, One Minute. \"It's better to take a minute to cool down, then be a minute away from the hospital.\"  She doesn't need to be caring for others if she can't take the time to educate herself.", "NTA. You really need to go no contact with your parents and your sister. Your sister is incredibly toxic and your parents just accepting makes them toxic as well.", "NTA\n\nTime to cut contact with family and friends that don\u2019t side with you", "NTA the rest of your family are huge AH. Do no let your son around your toxic sister. Shame on your mother for allowing your sister to talk bad about you in front of your son and does nothing to defend you", "Your sister obviously doesn't love him if she was so pissed you had to take care of a medical issue for him during her wedding and missed pictures to the point she told you to die. NTA", "NTA. NO, NO, and NO!!! Keep your toxic sister away from your child. Anyone who talked crap about me and my husband would NOT be allowed around my children. Sister has no rights to your son; if she doesn't want a relationship with you, then fine, but she doesn't get one with your child/children either. NC with sis sounds like the best solution, and LC with your mom if she can't understand how unhealthy this is.", "NTA. She decided to keep you out of her life so everything of yours should also be excluded. How can she have a relationship with your son when she wants nothing to do with you. She can't have it both ways", "NTA but you need therapy. I understand setting boundaries can be hard but your inability to stand up to your parents when they treat you badly will negatively impact your son. For his sake, you really need to work out these complexes you have. \n\nI just wanna be clear that it\u2019s not your fault your parents treat you worse than your sister, but your family dynamic is extremely messed up. You need to deal with that because it\u2019s very inheritable trauma and if you don\u2019t want to pass it on to your son, it needs to be dealt with ASAP. In the meantime, I\u2019d cut them off. Not permanently, just until you can set clear boundaries with them.", "NTA. If you can manage without the childcare, I'd go very low contact with your parents and no contact with your sister. You don't need this crap in your life, and they'll never change because they don't think they're doing anything wrong.", "NTA and no your kid your rules...tell her to take a long walk off a short pier....nuff said.", "God, I think I need off this sub. **NTA** and it sounds like your family may be actual sociopaths. As seems to be like, fucking always on this sub...", "Cut off contact with that b*tch and tell your parents this will be the last they heae from you if they kept spporting that b*tch who values her pictures more than her nephew's life. And when your parents ask how can you do this, just tell them \"that's just how i am\".", "In this scenario it's best that that you be an asshole. Never let your kid around someone who is pissed that their wellbeing was taken into consideration and addressed and who has no problem bad mouthing their parents. Your sister is entitled to a swift kick in the pants and you should probably go low or no contact with your parents. Their allowing their golden child abuse their grandchild whether they want to recognize it as abuse or not.", "I would never allow my child around someone who doesn\u2019t like me. Stop having your mom watch him. NTA.", "She \"loves\" him? She's holding a grudge because you made sure he didn't die from heat stroke. That's not love. \n\nNTA. She should be no where near children. Not just yours.", "NTA\nShe\u2019s toxic.  Don\u2019t let her taint your child with lies.", "NTA\n\nThese visits need to stop ASAP. She is doing emotional damage to your child. You have no obligation or responsibility to her whatsoever. If your parents go behind your back or don\u2019t respect your wishes, cut contact with them as well.", "Completly agree. NTA... you should keep your son away from her...for some many reasons... she didnt understand the child was getting a hot stroke at her wedding and you needed to leave...that is selfish  ...the fact she didnt realize that shows she might put the child in danger in a different situation...also you dont trash a kid parents in from of the kid, that is just mean...the kid Will be sad and Will not understand It. She loves the child? Are you sure?  She only loves herself.", "I would have canceled the ceremony and gone to visit my nephew. This is mean. Mean to the point of monster because she wished death upon the child\u2019s parents, IN FRONT OF THE CHILD!!!", "Exactly. The conversation should have gone\n\nHer: Where's OP, she's not here and that's going to ruin my precious wedding photos\n\nOP's Mom: [Toddler] had signs of heat stroke, so she's taking care of him right now\n\nHer: OMG, is he ok??? Of course my nephew's life is more precious than these photos. I apologize for getting mad earlier. Boy it sure would have made me sound like a monster to get mad over something like that huh?", "If I can give a life tip - one of the most powerful things you can learn is to be okay with being the villain in someone else\u2019s story. \n\nJust because they see you as \u201cthe bad guy\u201d, that doesn\u2019t make it true. However, trying to change their narrative will likely never work, and only hurts you in the long run, and if someone is committed to seeing you as \u201cthe bad guy\u201d, the only good choice is to step away from that person.\n\nETA - NTA.", "Editing to add judgement: NTA.", "OP is an ah for not letting her toddler get heatstroke, which is really dangerous especially for little kids?", "Or to let her take him when she visits and she doesn't deserve to be around your son.", "OP in all sincerity please get therapy. You are allowing your parents to treat you poorly bc you are the \u201cgood/nice\u201d daughter. Ask yourself why you willing to put your son through your sister emotional hate dumping about you to him. This isn\u2019t healthy. You can\u2019t stop their behavior or actions but you do control yours and get to choose the environment you bring up your children in. Maybe not having as much access to you and your kid may be the wake up call your parents need to respect you and acknowledge the disrespect they and your sister have been giving you over the years", "Take a little vacation from your parents OP, let them feel loss of a relationship with YOU. You might be happier with some distance from them, anyway.", "You need to put some boundaries. Why your sister getting all the special treatment and you dont? Because she knows how to put boundaries. It is not ok that your parents to let your son to spend time with your sister if you dont want It. Is time for you to get mad too", "Your sister is so Weird I\u2019d be afraid she would kidnap your son.", "Yeeeah your parents just think it\u2019s easier to pressure you to keep your sister happy. I would stop talking to them as well at this point since they\u2019re willing to sacrifice both you and your son to appease your sister.", "It's wrong that they are keeping your child from YOU when she is around.  Your sister isn't owed visitation rights and your parents are on her side. \n\nThis is the child that your sister would have had suffer from heatstroke for the sake of her photos. Take a sabattical from your family for the next 6 months.", "You did great stopping your mom's babysitting. That's how you uphold a boundary - remove their ability to break your boundaries. You are in the right here. They are gaslighting you by saying you are ridiculous.", "It sounds like your mom shouldn\u2019t be seeing your son either until she can be trusted to follow your wishes and keep him away from your sister.", "Hopefully the devil wil drag her under with a soul so heavy she'll never float."]}
