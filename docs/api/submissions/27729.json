I know my fianc\u00e9 has definitely given me spoiled princess treatment and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s coloring the way I see this or if I\u2019m right.\n\nWhen Jay bought his house it was a 3bd/3ba but he wanted a fireplace in his bedroom so he converted the den and now it\u2019s 4 bedrooms. But it doesn\u2019t have a closet and the nearest bathroom is the smallest. He used the master bedroom for guests.\n\nI\u2019ve been slowly moving in over the last few months and I brought up needing more space and he gifted me the master bedroom as my personal space. I have plenty of room in the bathroom and closet and I can use the room for my altar and my cats\u2019 stuff. Plus I\u2019m chronically ill and sometimes it\u2019s better to sleep alone. He turned his office into the new guest room which is a much smaller space.\n\nI don\u2019t actually live there yet though and won\u2019t for maybe ~6 months.\n\nHis friend Matt lives out of state but took a project in our city and was going to stay here with Jay for 12 weeks. The last time Matt visited, he was in the master bedroom and I guess he under the impression that he would using that room again. \n\nHe seemed surprised when he got here but he didn\u2019t say anything right away. It started after a couple days though - \u201cit\u2019s such a small room for an extended stay\u201d, etc. little comments but it\u2019s been about 2 weeks and yesterday, I was over putting my summer stuff away in the closet and he came in to ask if I\u2019d be okay with him moving to that room because he felt cramped in the other and I declined. I already have stuff in there that I *do not* want anyone touching and I would be uncomfortable with him in there. \n\nHe got upset and called me selfish and a \u201cpampered little princess\u201d and that he thought it was so weird that I was being \u201clike this\u201d when I don\u2019t even live here. I said it didn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s still my room and it\u2019ll be my house too soon enough so who cares about technicalities. We argued and it escalated and it ended with me telling him to gtfo if he couldn\u2019t respect me. I think he thought Jay wouldn\u2019t let me do that but he took my side and asked Matt to find an Airbnb for the rest of his stay. I ended up going home for the night but I know Jay and Matt stayed up arguing about it for most of the night and their friendship is done. \n\nI was telling my sister about it this morning and I was surprised when she wasn\u2019t on my side. She said she couldn\u2019t understand why I\u2019d tank my fianc\u00e9\u2019s friendship when I could just let him use the room since I\u2019m not even moved in yet. She accused me of taking advantage of my fianc\u00e9 and being selfish. \n\nAnd she\u2019s right, Jay will take my side even when *I* know I\u2019m wrong so him agreeing with me isn\u2019t a good litmus test. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong, it\u2019s my room and I didn\u2019t want him in there. It\u2019s not like he had to sleep on the couch, it was just a small room.

That's it. His friend wasn't happy that he didn't get the master bedroom, assuming he also isn't paying anything for his lengthy stay, assumed, that he could order you around in your fianc\u00e9's house. He learned, though. You didn't end this friendship. Matt did with his nasty comments that Jay wasn't cool with.\n\nBTW, it's very telling that Matt came to you about the room, and when you didn't agree with letting him stay in it, he started his insults. I bet this wasn't the first time he expressed these feelings about you, he's most likely said it all to Jay already, this was just the final straw.", "NTA\n\nAnd Mat is behaving like little princess because he gets to stay for free in friends'  house and feel entitled to complain about room not being \"right size\". He can stay in Airbnb where he can choose any size he wants and pay for that.\n\nJay and you are couple, and even if you didn't still officially moved in, Jay gave you master room to be yours. \n\nMat can suck rocks and tell your sister that if she prefers SO choose entitled friend over her, she can be with person like that. You don't need her approval how Jay and you build your relationship.", "Matt needs to get over himself. He's staying with a friend....he's a guest....and complaining that he doesn't get the master bedroom?!", "NTA. Matt seems like a choosing beggar and an ingrate. Hosting someone for 12 weeks is a big deal. He should have gratefully taken the room he was given, or graciously defined and sought other accommodation. He openly insulted you and got what was coming. \n\nHowever, there is one thing you could have done better. You shouldn\u2019t have thrown him out. You don\u2019t live there. It is Jay\u2019s call. Totally fine if you\u2019d have asked Jay for that. Ultimately you knew he\u2019d have your back and he did, so not a huge thing.", "NTA  Matt had a room, if it was so cramped and annoying for him he could of spent his own money and got an Airbnb. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault that Jay and Matt argued, and the entitled one is Matt who is staying for free trying to dictate what he gets in his FREE stay. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why people are going with the other judgement, but it\u2019s your room now as Jay said & the other room is the guest room. You have entitlement to your room and your things in there. I\u2019m glad your partner supported you and I\u2019m surprised anyone would disagree with your stance.", "NTA\n\nHe was offed the spare room it sounds fully functional. He is behaving like an AH because you won't give your room up for him.\n\nYour BF is right to back you up.", "NTA. He was a guest in the house, he should be happy to have his own room and not just have to sleep on a chouch or pay for his stay. It doesn't matter if the master bedroom is used by you, if it was a storage room or the room he keeps all his reptails - it was Jay decission to let Matt stay in one of his rooms. And Matt could have left at any point if it was to small for him. But expecting that he get better treatment at a place where he stays for free sounds also spoilt (well it cost nothing to ask, but he should have accepted a no)\n\nBut maybe talk to Jay, if he is sad about ending the friendship and if so if there is anything that can be done to save it. So you show him, that you are also at his side.", "I bet Matt was paying top rate too. Right? Surely...\n\nHe complained that his free accommodation was smaller than last time. Obviously needs the bigger room for his princess-pile of mattresses. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2018s your room. Matt can ask, you decide. If he don\u2018t like it that\u2019s his problem. In his stead I wouldn\u2019t have ended a friendship over this.", "[deleted]", "Hmm\u2026 I think ESH. \nYou suck because you were inflexible. 12 weeks is a long stay and would be difficult in a small space and you were not empathetic to this and didn\u2019t try to compromise. You jumped straight to gtfo when it wasn\u2019t your house. You could have tried a number of different things, but jumped straight to that. \nYour fianc\u00e9s friend sucks for his entitlement. He is getting free accomodation and he could\u2019ve just taken no for an answer. \nYour fianc\u00e9 sucks because as you\u2019ve noted he will always take your side, even if you\u2019re wrong.

You do sound rather entitled and if you're not using the room, or even living in the house full-time, you don't get a say on what happens there. You had no business even discussing the use of the room or kicking the friend out of the house. It sounds like you definitely have come between friends and an apology to both is in order, IMO.\n\nThe friend has no right to complain about cramped quarters in a place he mooching.", "ESH, except for Jay. The OP is so inflexible and entitled, not willing to share at all. And Matt is somehow worse. I feel like there is a lot more to this story than we are told.", "YTA. You sound like a petulant spoiled entitled gold digger.", "YTA. Good god. \n\nSo I am clear. \n\nYou admit pampered princess treatment (this poor man, what he has created\u2026)\nIt is not your house \nYou don\u2019t even use that room full time\nYou are causing problems in his friendships and forcing him to choose AND kicking someone out of a home that isn\u2019t even yours\n\nIt is NOT your room, you don\u2019t own the house and I bet you don\u2019t even pay anything towards rent or utilities. Absolute mooch, I would be so embarrassed posting this, I truly hope this is a troll post. You seem almost proud of how you abuse this man. \n\nWhy would this friend respect you? What exactly have you done to to earn it? Because I agree entirely with his summary of you plus a lot more. I hope your fianc\u00e9 sees the light here.", "ESH - Matt sucks because he was staying for free in his friends house, and as such he shouldn't have complained about the space. I would have let him know that he was acting like a \"pampered little princess\" by staying somewhere for free but complaining about the accommodations.\n\nHowever,  I don't think you were right in the situation either. It's not like you are sleeping in the room.. From what I can tell you are basically using this whole room as storage/closet, and that you were unwilling to have any kind of compromise about it does show that you are selfish and extremely entitled. And it was definitely an entitled asshole move to tell him to GTFO when it isn't even your home.", "do you pay for the room ? if not your TA", "ESH. You may have your fianc\u00e9\u2019s word that the master is \u201cyour room,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to kick the friend out (especially telling him to \u201cGTFO.\u201d). You are not even living there, as your sister pointed out. Even if Jay sides with you, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s clear that you get your way with him no matter what. That seems like a terrible dynamic. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend should not have come to you about the room as it is Jay\u2019s house. He is staying for free and, as a guest, should be grateful for any room he gets. \n\nI think this situation could have been avoided or resolved by telling Matt it\u2019s not your decision but Jay\u2019s.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
