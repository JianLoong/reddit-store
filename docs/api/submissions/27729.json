It started after a couple days though - \u201cit\u2019s such a small room for an extended stay\u201d, etc. little comments but it\u2019s been about 2 weeks and yesterday, I was over putting my summer stuff away in the closet and he came in to ask if I\u2019d be okay with him moving to that room because he felt cramped in the other and I declined. I already have stuff in there that I *do not* want anyone touching and I would be uncomfortable with him in there. \n\nHe got upset and called me selfish and a \u201cpampered little princess\u201d and that he thought it was so weird that I was being \u201clike this\u201d when I don\u2019t even live here. I said it didn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s still my room and it\u2019ll be my house too soon enough so who cares about technicalities.

It's not like you are sleeping in the room.. From what I can tell you are basically using this whole room as storage/closet, and that you were unwilling to have any kind of compromise about it does show that you are selfish and extremely entitled.

He's offered 12 weeks of free room and board and he has the audacity to complain.", "He probably did ask the homeowner who said no. Then he went to her hoping to say \"well she says it's fine\"", "Same. I had a friend who\u2019d give me the private room in her finished basement when I came to visit. Then one time we were making plans and she was like \u201coh, that\u2019s [oldest son]\u2019s room now, you\u2019d have to sleep on the pullout in the sun room\u201d so I just made hotel reservations instead. No one got mad and we all survived.", "And what would be Matt's excuse/reasoning the next time he comes for a visit and OP HAS moved in and now that master room REALLY is hers? Is Matt going to expect that room? He needs to get used to not having the master room anymore.", "And he probably was getting a stipend for the 3 months and pocketing it. Now he has to spend it.", "Same. My Mom used to say it.", "OP explained that Jay made the den his actual bedroom as it had the fireplace. So he gave himself the space he wanted first of all. Then saw that OP could use the master as it has room for her things and it makes her happy.

She has stated as much. She is also getting married to the guy and he has given her permission to call that room her own. The ex best friend got butthurt because she told him no. He couldn't handle a woman saying no to him. A man not accepting no for an answer? Hmm, where have I heard that one before? \n\n >And there she is, swanning around calling a house she hasn't put a cent into hers\n\nPlease show me in the post or the comments where she called the house hers? \n\n>and ordering her partners best friend around\n\nShe told him to get out of her room when he insulted her because he was being sexist. Maybe she even kicked him out of the house for being sexist. Either way, she has put money into the home and she had her future husband's support in the be matter.\n\nI would have done the same thing if one of my friends tried to insult my husband when he was living in my house and before we were married.  Spouses and couples support each other, especially when a friend verbally attacks one of them. AND especially when the attack is based in sexism and isn't warranted. \n\n>But hey, I know there is a whole movement in the US to make women totally reliant on men again, so I guess you're part of that.\n\nYou have a lot of growing up to do, friend.", "Yes.

It\u2019s not about siblings taking your room after you move out. They live there. But I give up.", "Jesus Christ", "But she didn\u2019t respect the homeowner.

I\u2019m betting there\u2019s a whole lot of OP is glossing over regarding her own bad behavior. I also wonder how much of the overnight argument was Matt trying to warn Jay off. \n\nI\u2019m not giving Matt a pass, but based on the story and tone, I\u2019m not going all in on OP being a reliable narrator either.", "How many different ways do you want me to say yes?\n\nIf you aren't married, don't live there, and you don't have a financial stake in the location, why should you get a say in who the owner invites?", ">talc or gypsum(rock/mineral)   \n>  \n>ostrich(egg) apparently you can stand on one of these eggs and not crack it."]}
