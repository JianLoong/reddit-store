That she just wants to talk through details and bond in that way, which is exceedingly annoying for you after everything has already been organised.\n\nI actually think this is it\u2014that what she\u2019s hoping for is endless chats and in-person communication where you fuss over her (not necessarily that you do the actual tasks competently).\n\nBut also, you are doing A LOT.

I had my SIL as my MOH because I didn\u2019t want to choose between my friends and she is very close to my husband. However I only had her plan the bachelorette and another bridesmaid did the shower.

Micromanaging is never appropriate in sports, or work, or wedding parties.\n\nI don't know where you go, I would be tempted to talk to your brother, explain your thoughts, and let him intercede with his beloved. But, as you're MOH, I don't think your comments to the bride were out of order. You stated your boundaries and enforced them.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019d argue it\u2019s not even an honor when it\u2019s a CLOSE friend or relative whom you love when the bride is picky and demanding.  \n\nShe asked (begged?) you to do this because she had nobody else. \n\nNTA but I\u2019d sit down with them and tell them how you feel. This sounds incredibly stressful", "NTA I just know if we met we would be friends. I love how you have articulated the situation. She is taking liberates and is being difficult. If she wants to be extra particular about the details she can plan it herself. Micromanaging projects she has delegated and nit picking is probably her anxiety showing, but that doesn't give her the blanket excuse to abuse your generosity for the sake of a tedious \"honor.\" Does she not have friends of family that like her? I think they know her well enough to have safely avoided the \"honor\" of being her bridesmaid. Why else beg someone you hardly know?", "NTA and you are literally doing her a favor because y\u2019all aren\u2019t close and have no one else", "Whoo boy!  NTA at all.  You didn't take it too far.  And your parents are wrong that you were too harsh.  Nothing else was getting through to her.  I would have snapped long before you did.  Honestly, you're a nicer person than I am.  \n\nI too am very organized and detail oriented.  I have happily helped family and friends I love (or even like quite a bit) with various events, good (like showers/parties) and not so good (like memorials).  My part in those was out of love, friendship, and mutual, reciprocal relationships.\n\nI sure understand why you felt pressured into saying yes to being her MoH when you didn't want to be and when your relationship doesn't warrant that commitment.  I've never been asked to be an MoH, thank goodness, though before my sister and BIL decided to basically elope, I would have been hers.  We are super close, know each other's strengths and weaknesses, and have been there for each other our whole lives.\n\nYou have choices to make.  \n\nYou can apologize for snapping and move forward knowing every interaction with your FSIL will be a PITA and that it will probably set the tone for your ongoing relationship with her.  She badgers and pressures and guilts until you cave.  She'll know or at least, believe that you will let her dominate your relationship (such as it is).  People like her always expect others to bend to their will.  Once she and your brother are married, she'll add, \"But FaMiLy. You have to support faaaamily.\"  I suspect it will never be a two-way street either.  She will always make demands of your time, effort, and probably money, but will always also be too busy or not interested or some other excuse if you need help.\n\nYou can tell your brother and FSIL that you stand by your statements, but understand that they need your help with the wedding and you did agree (even though, no it is not a freaking \"honor\").  Then you can set at least some limitations on your time, energy, etc., while still going through with the basics of what they expect.  Then after the wedding, if she or your brother start making further demands, stand firm and say no, you've done enough.\n\nYou can tell them that you are not up to the tasks/obligations or that you \"don't want to let them down\" or whatever and bow out as MoH, letting one of her bridesmaid friends deal with her crap.  You could include a stronger statement that you are finished being taken advantage of, micromanaged, and berated/nagged/criticized repeatedly.  You could state outright that you have your own life and that your time is valuable/precious to you, so you are finished with her abuse of it and will attend their wedding as a regular guest.  This will almost certainly cause a rift with your brother, at least temporarily, but that rift may form over time regardless of what you do now because it kind of sounds as if your brother caves to your FSIL's demands and will likely continue to do so.\n\nI'd go with option number three, but that's me. \n\nYour BF is right and he's the one who has no doubt seen the day-to-day stress and pressure your FSIL has put on you and is putting you through.  Only you can decide how best to proceed, but I'd suggest you sit down with your parents and tell them exactly what you've done for your FSIL and exactly how she's been treating you.  You might remind them that your feelings, time, and energy are equally important, regardless of this being your FSIL's \"big day\" and her fantasy of a fairytale wedding.  (And man am I tired of the whole \"But it's **My Big Day**.

She might have felt that by doing this, you would feel closer to her. And the whole time you are doing it because you have to. She said it xD you don't do it because you want to but because you have to, it is very clear to her and that probably feeds on her insecurities. She probably wanted to have that stuff you see on TV where you have the bride and the bridesmaid bond over the planning and stuff. And instead you are very independent and good at organizing and you have little time, so she becomes more convinced you don't like her.\n\nMaybe have a 1 on 1 with her. Tell her you accepted because you wanted to be nice to her, yes you didn't have to do the bridal stuff, and you didn't want at first because you don't have time, but you did it because you wanted to be nice to her. I feel that is the part she is missing, she probably feels like you don't even want to be nice, you just do it out of obligation. Many times, people who have been abused are very used to doing things whether they want them or not, and it is easy for them to project that idea into others. So she can totally imagine you are doing everything not because you want to be nice with her, but because she nagged you so much you thought it was easier doing it than putting up with her and you are just going through while clenching your teeth.\n\nJust tell her you want to welcome her in the family and have a good relationship with her. And that you need her help too. But that help is in the way of her relaxing, you cant do so many meetings and stuff because you are very busy. She needs to relax and let it flow. You want her to enjoy the celebrations. She doesn't need to force it. And if you do have the time, try to do some meetings here and there so she gets a bit more of that bonding time.\n\nIf you talk to her like that and she still behaves like an ah, then you know she is just an ah and let her do whatever.\n\nNTA", ">She has friends, they\u2019re the other bridesmaids.

She\u2019s nervous and unhappy and she doesn\u2019t know what to do with those feelings because there\u2019s no quick fix and once the wedding is over, there\u2019s no re-do.

She knows, deep down, that she\u2019s being a jerk, but she doesn\u2019t know how else to deal with all that grief and anxiety. \n\nI suspect asking you to be her MOH was a bid for closeness to a person she *hopes* will help fill the hole her birth family left behind.

My mom was thrilled to be in charge of it--she did my baby shower too (they were both lovely.) Other than that, I did it all, with help from my husband. I didn't ask people to stand up with me to make them into indentured labor, I just wanted them with me on the day.", "Great advice here.", "I don't have any idea why a MOH would plan dress fittings, appointments with musicians, cake tastings, etc. Around here, the MOH's obligation is to stand up with the bride in clothes the bride picked and hold her flowers when she says \"I do.\" It's also fairly common for the maids to go dress shopping, plan a shower and/or bachelorette party, but not mandatory. The rest of this list the OP outlined is just bullshit. Bride needs to do it herself or hire a wedding planner.", "Honestly!
