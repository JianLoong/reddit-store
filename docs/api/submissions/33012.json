Jane got snippy and said she felt like I was only doing all this because I \u201chad to\u201d, which really set me off. I told her under now circumstances did I have to, that I was doing her a favour and she should remember that this is a courtesy not an obligation before she treats me like an indentured servant.

I said that\u2019s fine but I never had, in fact I told Jane it would be difficult and she insisted, and I caved to be nice but she\u2019s taking liberties.

In my opinion, a bride can get a little snippy or a little demanding when it comes to their Maid of Honor - if there's a long, positive relationship.  I mean, I could put up with some sherty nonsense from my best friend, but...that's a dude that's been there for me at the worst times, and done a lot of things for me.  So it's reciprocity.  For this, for you, though.... *basically someone as close as a work acquaintance is asking you for those same privileges without the good parts.*  If that makes sense.  So.... no.  She needs to remember what she's asking, and who she's asking, and be grateful she has you. \n\nHmmm, I wonder why she couldn't ask any of HER friends or family to do it..... does she not have any?

Hell, she could have done it all herself (well the bridal shower the brides' maids or maid of honor usually throws, but the rest, she could have dealt with herself, and sounds like she just wants to be nitpicky about everything. As for her fiance being upset about you upsetting her, he's either looking blindly away from everything or doesn't see what she's doing. As for your parents, do they not realize everything that has been going on? If they don't then that's probably why they are reacting like they are. But also SIL came to you begging for your help and wanting you to be in it knowing you were busy and lived farther away. \n\nIf they are going to continue to treat you like they are I would say I'm no longer available.

An honor to be asked, an honor to be thought that highly of, sure... But doing all that work and shelling out all that money, an honor?

You tried to beg off. Perhaps you still should. She will have the benefit of the work you have done so far and can use your notes to make any changes she wants. There\u2019s no reason you have to continue to be involved. Just beg off nicely. You can apologize for hurting her feelings, without saying you did anything wrong, and use that as a reason to withdraw from the bridal party.", "NTA good luck with that dramatic person all your life now eeeekkkk", "NTA. just stop doing the role or helping her. if she's going to be upset may as well make her really upset lol.", "NTA.", "Jane is a choosing beggar.

You're doing it, and you're efficient, but she's a PIA.  My guess is that you'd agree with those statements.\n\nMy guess is also that you make that abundantly, as in ah-BUN-dant-ly, clear to her.  Now, what bride in her right mind would want that? What person in their right mind would want anyone to do something for them with that attitude?\n\nShe came to you for help.  It's pretty likely you're her last choice, because, again, who would want the grudging help you provide when you are so snitty about it, but for whatever reason she doesn't have other female friends who can fill the role.  Those on here with dozens of real or imagined friends may not understand that, but sometimes that's just the way life goes.  So she turned to you.\n\nYou don't have to be her MOH.  I think that makes you a bit selfish, but probably not overly so because it is a big ask.  If you weren't going to do it *with grace* you should have just insisted on declining.  You know, something like \"Look, my life is about me, not you.  You're just not really important enough to me, and my brother isn't really important enough to me, for me to be able to do this and so I'm afraid I can't.  I hope you can understand and can find someone who gives a shit.\"  Something classy like that.\n\nBut once you agree to do it, rubbing her nose in how much you really don't want to do it at all is just rude and is spoiling her once-in-a-lifetime event.", "There is a reason Jane is light on friends.\n\nI would probably call her, Apologize on perhaps using the wrong tone.... And tell her you're so happy to help her with this. But you feel that she's kind of micromanaging you and everything's under control.\n\nDo it for your brother", "NTA.

You didn\u2019t read what she was trying to tell you. Her wedding and her bridal shower wasn\u2019t important for her, what was important for her was to organize it WITH YOU. She probably wanted somebody from her family as a MOH, as she has no option, she chose you for that. Clearly, she didn\u2019t want a friend but somebody from family. And she wants to feel less lonely and organize this with you. As you are organizing all by yourself, that doesn\u2019t work. And as she feels she forced you, her insecurities are getting worse and she gets defensive.\n\nIf you want to, you have time to change this. Just talk to her and try to have a mindful conversation about what this means to her.", "YTA\nIt's going to be one of her most important days, she has every right to fuss over every little detail.", "She is NC with her family due to abuse. \n\nShe has friends, they\u2019re the other bridesmaids.

Let the ones giving you a hard time do it.  Your parents and brother can do it.  You don't owe her anything, but she owes you respect, and thankfulness.  Like you said you're not close, why can't one of her friends help her?  She probably knows her friends wouldn't put up with her crap either.", "That doesn't entitle her to treat you badly!  I'm sure it is difficult to do this without family support - but I'm a suspicious she might also be a difficult person and thus not have a MOH that is a friend.  Please don't back down.  Be kind but let her know how you feel when she is not treating you well.  Ugh.  You aren't in an enviable position."]}
