You just didn't tell her. \n\nLook, I don't know why your friends with this person but since you had plans and then decided to vacation with her YTA for not saying looks like it won't work out.", "NTA but why would you want someone that entitled and immature sounding in your life? Surely a stump would be more enjoyable.", "YTA for not just telling her during the trip i guess? I mean you had perfectly valid reasoning for going alone, so if she gets mad that\u2019s on her", "NTA.  She is one of those people who want to keep you hanging and not finalize her plans until the last minute.  My spouse is actually one of those people.  I have to practically threaten them to get them to commit to a plan.  I've learned to do what I want when I want, because they won't get on board with it until the day before.  Yes, you had a plan with her but she kept delaying it until the agreement was meaningless.", "INFO: Did you actually lie? Because that's what the title says, but the post describes you just failing to tell her, not lying about it. \n\nIf you simply failed to inform her, I think you wouldn't be the asshole. 1. She pushed back the shared vacation to August, when you weren't sure you could go. 2. There was only one seat available, so she couldn't have gone with you even if she could get away earlier.", "INFO did going on the trip mean you couldn't go on another trip with her?", "I wanted to tell her when i came back, but like i said i was just happy about clearing i kinda just focused on my work and studies and forgot i even took the trip. And we didn't meet for months after i came back, so the thing was so in past it just doesn't come naturally in conversation after that.", "Ahh i mentioned in PS, she has history of drastic steps like that and i didn't wanna lose a friend. I planned to tell her in person but we didn't meet for months because of our work.", "Yeah plus the only reason i didn't plan my vacation before exams was because of her, otherwise i wanted to leave instantly after my exams. Every train/plane was booked when i was looking in June, so when i saw an empty seat in this cool train i kinda forgot everything and planned and left.", "Yeah that's true. Ig she's thinking i hid the fact for months on purpose when i kinda just forgot about it.", "Nope, but she wasn't finalizing much and my vacation was ending soon so yeah it kinda meant i couldn't", "You should have told her when she texted you.  If she blocks you, she blocks you.", "Oh I read that part, it just doesn\u2019t make a difference imo. If she reacts poorly to a valid reason and leaves, then she wasn\u2019t worth lying for. I\u2019d take an objective look at you friendship and figure out if her \u201cdrastic\u201d behavior is worth keeping around.", ">we both were planning to go somewhere but she kept delaying like June end, July mid or August and i could've waited ... I'd have to start studying again, neither of which i could do if i went so late so i kinda just gave up on plan to go.\n\nIt sounds like you weren't going with her at that point. You had already given up the plan to go with her because she kept delaying. In June (when she couldn't go anyway), you went without her, because the timing was right for you. This isn't your best friend or someone you have known for a long time. I'm not sure why she is so mad. I don't tell all my friends everything...", "what happened to conversations after your trip though? Did either of you reach out to ask if you were still gonna go on a trip during your vacation time?", "Yeah ig, thanks for your pov \ud83d\udcab", "She is a nice friend, ig we just have different personalities. I prefer doing things solo and she needs group or alot of people for everything. I am social too but ig subconsciously i wanted to be alone to move on from the breakup and do my own thing, i remember now she said that she wanted to do everything together on the trip and i just can't do that.", "Idk why she was mad, ig she was counting on me to go because she has never done solo. She planned a trip with her cousins after i said no and even they cancelled due to one or other reasons so i felt natural to not say until she went by herself on a trip like 10 days later and then my results came and i kinda just forgot and we didn't talk daily or something like that.", "Well then tell her that! Maybe the reason she gets \u201cdrastic\u201d is the lack of communication between you two. It could be that she simply doesn\u2019t know your feelings and has been acting on assumption"]}
