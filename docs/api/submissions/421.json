This sucked because music is my home, the thing that comforts me and it\u2019s not fun when I have an ad after every song. No, this account didn\u2019t have premium or anything just our playlist.\n\nI am a very sensitive person in general and I don\u2019t deal with arguments very well. \n\nToday, I decided I have had enough of sharing this account and that they could make their own. I logged all devices out of the account and pretended I didn\u2019t know how it happened, I logged back in and I posted some music on my status. \u201cWait, you got logged back in? Can you tell me the password I forgot.\u201d \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with sharing the account anymore\u201d \u201cwhy?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d then they lashed out at me. Telling me how selfish I am and how much time they spent on their playlist and that I should\u2019ve told them sooner. I don\u2019t agree with this. I told them I knew this would happen if I told them and they kept saying about how im selfish and how this hurt them. I blocked them. Im in a group chat with them so they texted me apologising, I flipped them off. I was not having this. If they wanted their playlist back they can search the account and use it. I am still hurt by how they lashed out at me and am being very dry with them.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: I am going to apoligise to my friend. I understand that I was a shitty person for how I handled this.

Here's how this should have gone down:\n\nYou: \"I think it's time we have our own Spotify accounts\"\n\nFriend: \"But my playlist -\"\n\nYou: \"Don't worry, you can create your own account and you'll still have access to this playlist and all the songs - you'll just have to create a new playlist on your account but it will have all the same songs.\" \n\nSo freaking simple. Instead you were just a dick.", "YTA. How much they listen to spotify has noting to do with ads. If you don't pay for premium, you get ads. That's how they can offer free accounts to people.\n\nYou had a problem and you didn't even think about talking to someone you say is your friend. You just booted them and played ignorant. And when they started to realize what was going on, you just lied to them and blocked them.\n\nThey have every right to be angry. Conflict is a part of life. Grow up and learn to have a conversation.", "You're so fucking immature, you \"don't deal with arguments very well\" so you just decided to create a problem and lie instead of just talking to your bestfriend ? And on top of that you just flipped them off when they tried to talk after that.\n\nGood for them you sound incredibly annoying.", "YTA\n\nNot for wanting your own account; that's totally fine. Instead of just saying that you want your account to be solo and giving them a chance to copy their playlist, you changed the account info, lied about it, and then went nuclear with blocking them. *Over a free product/service.*\n\nThat goes way beyond a general discomfort with conflict. You need to speak with a therapist about how to handle stressful situations. This is literally one of *the* most avoidable conflict situations I've ever read; a true no-harm-no-foul if ever there was, and you blew it up tremendously.", "YTA. I used to share an account with my younger brother, and I get some of your concerns. The ads are not your best friend's fault, that is just Spotify being Spotify.\n\nYou handled it very poorly, and since your friend has spent a long amount of time making playlist(s) through your account, their reaction is justified in this case, and nothing they said was out of bounds. But this all has a very simple fix, you could just make a new account for your friend (or ask them to make a new one) and simply share the playlists via links. I fail to see why this was a cause of conflict at all since you did not even have a premium account.", "YTA.  Deciding not to share your account is fine. It's yours.  The way you went about it is pure cowardice and completely out of the book of assholery.", "Try being honest in the future.", "YTA. Grow up.", "You already made up in your mind how this scenario would play out then you manifested it when you didn\u2019t communicate the situation. \nYou told yourself they would be mad but made no effort to change the course of what happened. \n\nCommunication is key, next time let people know if your decision is going to affect anyone in anyway, regardless if it makes you uncomfortable. \nYTA\n\nNow go make up with you\u2019re friends.", "YTA - you lied, got caught lying,  and they were upset because you lied. You couldn't even tell your best friend the truth and then blocked them and got upset because they were upset.", "YTA\n\nThat's not how you handle a situation like this. It wouldn't even have been an argument, but more of a heads up that you want your own account which is perfectly reasonable. You didn't even give them warning, just logged them out and that was that. Clearly this person isn't your \"best friend\" if you're going to block them and make them pay or whatever for rightfully being upset with you.", "Yta.\n\nWithout invalidating you, there was a better way of dealing with this. You were passive-aggressive and rude instead of being straight up and telling your friend sooner (like they exclaimed). \n\nThey lashed out because you did \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA. You handled this wrong. You could have just been honest about the situation, but instead made a conscious choice to act passive aggressive. Arguments are inevitable and at times necessary.

This will be a repeated situation throughout the course of your life if you don\u2019t.", "I don't understand - are you sharing a free Spotify account? What's the rationale behind doing that?", "Lol, that's not how the ads work on Spotify, which I'm sure you already knew. YTA.", "YTA big time. Doesn\u2019t like arguments than acts super toxic and creates a lot of drama over nothing.", "It\u2019s ok not wanting to share the account but YTA for how you handled it", "Wait, so its not a premium account? Then why cant the best friend made her own account?. And that is not how the ads work\u2026 im so confused with this, seems like a problem that shouldn\u2019t be a problem in the first place.", "YTA for how you handled it. You should have told the friend in advance. Also not sure why you didn\u2019t just tell then the reason when they asked!", "YTA \n\nHowever you seem to be younger, and I know confrontation is very scary. But believe me, in the long run, being up front and honest to those you care about is ALWAYS the right call.", "INFO: why are you two sharing a free account? i pay for my premium, but also am able to let my best friend use it as well via the Duo feature.", "YTA, not for wanting your spotify back, but for everything about how you handled this.  I'm ashamed for you.  You stopped talking to your \"best friend\" instead of having a basic conversation.
