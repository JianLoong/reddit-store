We were yet to announce it, but before we could do so we learned about the death of my nephew. My brother's newborn had died, and he informed us about it.\n\nWe went to his house to offer our condolences, and they were in a really distraught state. Here's the thing: I was buying a few supplies for my wife (related to her pregnancy) when I had gotten the announcement, and as I rushed to my brother's house immediately upon getting the message, we still had the purchases with us.\n\nUpon reaching there, we offered our condolences, and remained present for quite a while. It seemed as if my sister-in-law Emily was either pretending to keep her composure or looking for a topic to divert her mind, but she casually asked us what we were doing, considering the purchases, and what we had bought.\n\nI hesitated to answer, but she had already noticed some of the stuff in the bag and asked what those were. It was pretty obvious that they were related to the pregnancy, and although we said it's nothing, she seemed curious to know.\n\nSo we told her that she was pregnant. Emily began to cry when she learned what it was, while my brother began to accuse me of announcing it when they were dealing with the literal death of their child. He got into a huge verbal sparring with me, but I told him that we were about to announce it anyway, and that I hadn't wanted to lie since Emily had already kind of noticed what the stuff were.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696508324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170gi90/aita_for_announcing_my_wifes_pregnancy_when_my/", "score": 5152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep in mind, things may go back to how they were or they may never go back to how they were. This is a very distinct time in their lives: before devastating news, after devastating news. They need time to live with their new normal and work through those emotions and they may choose to no longer be around you and your new family.

Absolutely without question.  In that situation, and I don't typically recommend this, you lie through omission and/or generalizations, but even before that you \"think\" which you clearly did not.\n\nYou should have put the bags in the bushes before you rang the door bell, or just given them away on the street to strangers if you were in an urban situation in which they could not be hidden safely.  The cost of whatever the items are would never surpass the cost to your relationship with your brother and his wife, and the added turmoil you injected into their tragedy.\n\nI'm not really sure how you come back from this one, and the fact that both you and your wife were completely lacking in \"common sense \" skills to predict what would happen when you lugged in baby stuff is really mind-boggling.", "YTA You obviously are in the wrong here. It was an extremely inappropriate time to announce your pregnancy. You couldn\u2019t be more cruel and wrong. You should have brought the stuff home or have found another way to hide them from them.

And what were the items?", "So you didn't want to return everything you had spent time shopping for, which is understandable. What I don't understand...\n\nYou couldn't have bought a back pack/tote bag/luggage/reusable shopping bag/pillow case to hide your stuff in and make the purchases less obvious?\n\nHow about a generic gift bag to stick them in? That way if asked you could easily say you were picking up a gift for an acquaintance or something. What if you had them wrapped so you could justify not showing the contents?\n\nI bet if you asked, an associate would have put aside the purchases for you, possibly with online purchased in-store pick up items, for you to retrieve at another time so all you had to do was hold on to a receipt, which could be easily hidden.\n\nAnother option was to leave it outside their door on the porch/behind a plant.\n\nYou're about to have a child...your brother was in your shoes less than a year ago and you couldn't imagine that if you are so thrilled now, how devastated they must be? How baby things must be jumping out at them? Your presence was a bag of salt being rubbed in their wound. Showing up after going home with some food and snacks to help them stay strong would have been much more helpful than this immediate rush to their side.\n\nETA: your title makes it sound like this horrible event happened a while back, not your immediate response at the onset of their grief. So YTA no matter how you look at it, but the misleading nature of your title is more than enough to justify it already.", "I mean you could have left them in your car.", "YTA. That was a poor decision. The extra time it would have taken to go home first, have the taxi wait out front for 60 seconds while you drop the bags in your home, and then go on to your brothers would have been a minor inconvenience.\n\nYou knew they were grieving the death of their newborn, and you showed up at their house with pregnancy related purchases. Incredibly tone deaf and inconsiderate.", "I haven\u2019t been pregnant in years and still wear maternity clothes bc I like how the shirts are longer.

You do something to acknowledge that entering a home where a newborn just died with pregnancy and baby gear isn\u2019t a thoughtful choice.\n\nBeing there for your brother didn\u2019t mean being there as soon as possible. It meant being there as soon as you were able to be supportive. You can\u2019t rush to comfort someone without thinking. You have to have the wherewithal to be what they need in that moment.\n\nI think you rushing over was less about comforting your brother\u2019s family and more about joining them in the grieving process. I don\u2019t blame you for that - what happened was shockingly tragic and you ran on autopilot. \n\nHowever, by not taking a moment to stop and make sure you were prioritizing their grief over yours, you made two people who are going through one of the worst nightmares imaginable hurt a little bit more.

This is when a white lie is appropriate. \"You just brought stuff for a friend\" or whatever. Announcing your pregnancy at this point of time was incredibly cruel and tone-deaf.\n\nNot to mention, I can see you've mentioned that you had to take a taxi and live far away, which is why you brought the stuff. But you still could have ensured a jacket was covering the bag or put it aside somewhere, maybe even dropped it at a friend's if they lived closer. And honestly, they would have much rather you had taken longer to get there (by stopping off at home) than coming with a bunch of pregnancy and baby stuff.", "YTA, Jesus Christ you are self-centred, cruel and just plain awful. Also I\u2019m pregnant right now what \u201cobvious supplies\u201d are there? Did you really go visit your grieving brother and his wife with a pregnancy pillow?", "YTA and not even softly.

Even if it takes you a little longer to get there, you drop the things off at home first.  No one should even have to tell you this.\n\nAlso, how \"recent\" is your wife's pregnancy?  Many, many people don't announce until after the three month danger point, except perhaps the Grandparents to Be, since they should be told before everyone else if you don't have a toxic relationship with them.  Never tell anyone before three months who you wouldn't want to have to announce a miscarriage to.", "Obviously YTA", "YTA you should have dropped it at home first or left it outside.", "YTA. The whole situation could have been avoided if you'd shown a little forethought and not made your purchases obvious.\n\n Even then you had a chance to defuse the situation by backing down and apologizing rather than get defensive when your Brother confronted you.", "YTA you should have gone home first.

You can always say why you lied later and apologize.", "You have the emotional maturity of a child. YTA. What do mean 'pregnancy related stuff'. Unless you're talking books for expectanct parents or baby items, i can't think of anything you could have possibly purchased that were so obviously baby related that they would have figured it out if you hadn't opened your mouth.

If you were taking public transportation, then the best, most compassionate act would have been to either continue home and deposit goods, then turn around and go to your brother\u2019s.\n\n2) Then, the gruesome declaration. This was so blatantly dismissive of their grief. The cruelty is incomprehensible.\n\nIf your brother goes NC with you, I would not be surprised.\n\nEDIT: After reading your comments I\u2019ve Supersized your AH status. The reason you didn\u2019t go home first was it was too far?\n\nA) The taxi/car could have dropped you off (or get off the correct stop), and your wife continues home. When she arrived at home, she could have called you and either waited for or joined you, depending upon how your brother and SIL were.\n\nB) You argued with your brother about YOU mere hours after their child died?

This is tragic all the way around.", "YTA\n\nThink of it from their perspective. We just lost our baby, I'm heartbroken and my wife is, my brother is here to comfort but I see he has bags. I would wonder why do u have baby like bags. What I'm confused about is to why u brought them in my house. The to hear u say that. You could have waited for the right time, lets be fair.  It sounds like they just found out they lost they baby. If it was me, I would tell u to leave and cuss you out.

If the contents were queried, this is one of those rare occasions where the right thing to do... is lie. You don't get many occasions like that in life, but sometimes the truth isn't the right course of action at that moment. A quick \"Oh, we're buying some stuff for someone we know, don't worry about it, we'll move it out of your way\". That is truthful, but it's also a white lie by omission. You're kicking the can down the road that way.\n\nAs it is, you need to accept full blame, tell them you were unprepared for questions, so handled it wrong and hurt them in the process and you're so very sorry for doing so.\n\nI'm going to go with a YTA for mishandling the situation.", "What was in the bag?

But you can't expect OP and his Wife to have to wait a very long time just so that they can tell the Family that they are gonna have a kid.\n\nAnd i know it is very hard to loose a child.\nBut someday SIL and the Brother would have probably noticed that OPs wife was pregnant since the belly obviously grows when you are pregnant.\n\nAnd we don't know how they would have reacted to that, but SIL could have probably also started crying because she gets reminded of her baby, but there is nothing OP and his Wife can do about that. Because Brother and SIL will see alot of pregnant people, or people with Babys in their live. And that is just how it is, it's sad what happend to them but no pne can change that.", "I dunno it doesn\u2019t seem like YTA to me if you left the bags in the car and idk tried to hide it but if your brought them inside you\u2019re more of a dumbass instead of an Asshole\ud83e\udd23 only because I get it you were shopping and rushed over to your brother because something tragic happened and no need to take longer and being your bags home BUT what kind of dumbass brings the bags inside?? So this story is really 50/50 to me", "A lot of comments are saying that OP is TA because he should have thought about what bringing the purchases to the brothers house would do and taken the time to go home first. Honestly in hindsight, yea that would have been much better. But at the time OP had just received devastating news and was likely just trying to get to his brother as quickly as possible. No body knows what to do in a situation like that and unfortunately OPs instincts and quick actions led to more harm then good. I bet you the second SIL noticed the purchases OP was kicking himself. Sad situation all around and a little unfair to expect OP to have acted perfectly.", "I honestly don't understand how someone losing an infant equates to those people being upset that someone they know and love is pregnant.   I'm not arguing, or choosing a side, I just don't get it.  Can someone please explain?

This wasn't an \"announcement.\" You didn't send out a blast with celebration colors. You didn't set the date for the gender reveal. You simply shared with her after she asked.\n\nHere's the thing, your brother isn't TA either. He was grieving. Like very recently grieving. I can't imagine the feeling of being out of control from the immediate loss. Then you stumble in living your life, trying to help, and it all sucks beyond anything that has ever happened to any of you before.\n\nSo give each other some grace. Apologize to your brother for the argument. Let him know you're doing nothing public about your good news out of respect for him and his loss (but tell your parents, who are just as sad as everyone else and might appreciate knowing).

It happened. Accept that it happened at the worst possible time for them and that they may direct some ranting about the unfairness of the universe in taking their infant son from them in your direction. \n\nYour situation was a difficult one, because you didn't want to lie. At the same time, the worst thing to do when comforting a grieving person is to shift the spotlight onto yourself. It should stay on them. You can't bring up your pregnancy without shifting the spotlight away from them, at least, that's what it will feel like to them. That is probably what you need to reiterate to your brother and his wife, that you came over right away when you heard, but wish you'd dropped things off at home first, because you don't want to pull attention onto yourselves, being there for them is your highest priority. \n\nNext time, I recommend bringing something they may find comforting, especially for his wife, since she was interested in looking through the bag of what you'd bought.

You just wanted to get to your grieving family. You didn't \"announce\" anything.  This is probably the last way you wanted the news of your pregnancy to be revealed.  You just happened to have the bags and Emily, desperate for a distraction, happened to inspect them.\n\nIt's a sad, unfortunate, terrible situation where everyone was already distressed, and nobody went into it looking to hurt each other.

I hope you can all put it behind you and support each other in this difficult time.", "NTA", "NTA", "For me NTA people here acting like you went with the bags intentionally to their house. Of course not.

Cause that would make them feel sadder, which is the opposite of what we want. And anything that might bring up your news should be put away and out of sight. \n\nSo let's go over what that doesn't mean. It doesn't mean they aren't able to be happy for you, or that you need to not be truthful when asked questions, and it's ok to explain your reasoning for stuff, but suck up anything you can and give them their space to grieve and be consistent in your messaging and support.

Correct answer to the direct question was to deflect like you are intentionally not wanting to answer \"Just some random things, nothing important\" and move the bags out of view.
