{"id": 28264, "submission_id": "170gi90", "title": "AITA for announcing my wife's pregnancy when my brother & sister-in-law were still grieving the death of their newborn?", "selftext": "**EDIT:** I did not have a car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy (34 M) wife Amanda (32 F) got pregnant recently. We were yet to announce it, but before we could do so we learned about the death of my nephew. My brother's newborn had died, and he informed us about it.\n\nWe went to his house to offer our condolences, and they were in a really distraught state. Here's the thing: I was buying a few supplies for my wife (related to her pregnancy) when I had gotten the announcement, and as I rushed to my brother's house immediately upon getting the message, we still had the purchases with us.\n\nUpon reaching there, we offered our condolences, and remained present for quite a while. It seemed as if my sister-in-law Emily was either pretending to keep her composure or looking for a topic to divert her mind, but she casually asked us what we were doing, considering the purchases, and what we had bought.\n\nI hesitated to answer, but she had already noticed some of the stuff in the bag and asked what those were. It was pretty obvious that they were related to the pregnancy, and although we said it's nothing, she seemed curious to know.\n\nSo we told her that she was pregnant. Emily began to cry when she learned what it was, while my brother began to accuse me of announcing it when they were dealing with the literal death of their child. He got into a huge verbal sparring with me, but I told him that we were about to announce it anyway, and that I hadn't wanted to lie since Emily had already kind of noticed what the stuff were.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696508324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170gi90/aita_for_announcing_my_wifes_pregnancy_when_my/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also feel this is why you don't look in people's bags. I would have definitely dropped it off at home but I understand taxi can be expensive sometimes. Honestly you could have said some stuff we needed and left it at that. This wasn't done with malicious just poor planning.", "YTA. You effectively announced your wife\u2019s pregnancy as soon as your newborn nephew died, with not even a second taxi trip\u2019s worth of time between the events, because you thought that would be better than dropping the stuff off at home and being a bit later? You have the emotional awareness of a gnat.", "YTA for rushing to their house with your baby-related purchases. \n\nYou could have gone home and dropped off your shopping bags first. \n\nIt's common sense and something you should have realized that parents who just lost their baby don't want to see a bunch of baby items.", "Why did you bring the purchases around them and not just leave them in the car or run them home first?\n\nEta: soft YTA. Take the taxi home first and bring the stuff home. They are grieving the loss of an infant and I get wanting to rush there to help, but you ended up doing more harm than good in the end. I think you should apologize to them.", "Soft YTA \n\nDude you should\u2019ve dropped that stuff at home first\u2026I get it you probably weren\u2019t thinking but this is just a crappy situation. \n\nJust keep apologising to them but maybe keep your distance for a bit. It\u2019s gonna be hard to see you both right now.", "YTA....... Did you walk to the house and had nowhere to leave the shopping....You are a massive bellend with no sense of decency.", "You had nowhere to leave them?", "you could have just said .. nah some stuff for my wife and leave it at that YTA", "I want to say NAH. Because you didn't really announce your pregnancy voluntarily. It was an accident. And your brother is of course not thinking rationally given the situation, so I cant really blame him for his reaction.\n\nBUT, I'm curious what you said during the \"verbal sparring\"? Because I feel like it's your \"job\" to be the bigger man in that situation.", "Soft YTA. If I couldn\u2019t have made it home, I personally would\u2019ve chucked the bags into the bushes or left in the front yard before I walked in to that emotional minefield with those bags. Or I would\u2019ve lied my ass off because in those types of situations you\u2019re just trying to protect others. I honestly don\u2019t think it was malicious or a \u201chey look at me! Imma have a baby too!\u201d It was just poor thinking in a high octane situation. \n\nI\u2019d genuinely give a heartfelt apology and then give them space to move forward if they so desire to. Keep in mind, things may go back to how they were or they may never go back to how they were. This is a very distinct time in their lives: before devastating news, after devastating news. They need time to live with their new normal and work through those emotions and they may choose to no longer be around you and your new family. That\u2019s just something that you\u2019ll have to let them lead on. The pregnancy would\u2019ve come out eventually and you could\u2019ve had the same result but the way this happened was salt in an already open festering wound.\n\nLove to all of you because I feel that you all are going to need it.", "That's a strange tale.\n\nYes, YTA for not hiding the bags and for letting it come up.", "YTA. There is nothing a newly pregnant mom would need that would prove she\u2019s pregnant. Prenatal vitamins? The other vitamins she took were making her sick at her stomach so doc suggested we try those. Heck I\u2019ve known men to take prenatal vitamins. You were wrong on so many levels to tell them your wife was pregnant.", "Info: Wouldnt it be your first thought to hde the stuff you bought in your car? Why didnt you do something as to not confront a griefing couple with the new happy news of your wife being pregnant? Wasnt there really nothing you 2 could have done?\n\nNAH here i think. But both you and your wife have a low emotional IQ and you should let some time pass and ask for forgiveness later.", "Their child is dead.....you should've apologized immediately not get defensive and spar with your grieving brother and his wife. Apologize, until you go through it you won't understand the depth of pain, I hope you never will.", "Yta.  And your wife.  You should have went home first or sent your wife him with the shopping.  Hell I would have thrown that stuff away before walking into the home of someone\u2019s whose baby died with a bunch of baby stuff.", "I think NAH - except don't expect her not to be distraught. The idea we are supposed to get over death when it happens too young is crazy. I hope they allow themselves to grieve as much and hard as they need to - and definitely hope they seek bereavement therapy and support groups", "I don\u2019t understand\n\nYou went to your brothers house and brought bags of things in?  Why did you not leave them in the car? \n\nThis doesn\u2019t make sense", "Related to pregnancy, bs, unless it's proverbial pickles and ice cream.  Their child died,  and you couldn't come up with a lie of some sort? \n\nYTA a huge one.  Apologize,   this is not something g you get defensive about. Apologize.\n\nEdited to add 'still grieving?\", their child literally just died,  you are cruel and callous.", "Yta leave the shopping in the bushes even. No need to go in the house with that stuff complete disrespect", "YTA\n\nHonestly the issue of no car is irrelevant. You should have left that shit at home first. \n\nYou and your wife have the emotional intelligence of two raisins to think walking into the house with all that would have been appropriate.", "Yes, you are an a-hole.  Absolutely without question.  In that situation, and I don't typically recommend this, you lie through omission and/or generalizations, but even before that you \"think\" which you clearly did not.\n\nYou should have put the bags in the bushes before you rang the door bell, or just given them away on the street to strangers if you were in an urban situation in which they could not be hidden safely.  The cost of whatever the items are would never surpass the cost to your relationship with your brother and his wife, and the added turmoil you injected into their tragedy.\n\nI'm not really sure how you come back from this one, and the fact that both you and your wife were completely lacking in \"common sense \" skills to predict what would happen when you lugged in baby stuff is really mind-boggling.", "YTA You obviously are in the wrong here. It was an extremely inappropriate time to announce your pregnancy. You couldn\u2019t be more cruel and wrong. You should have brought the stuff home or have found another way to hide them from them. Taking baby stuff in was cruel.", "Wait. You rushed to your brother's house and felt it necessary to take baby-related purchases into their house, while they were grieving the very recent loss of a child?\n\nYeah, YTA.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make an announcement, you answered a question. At least their anger at you may have served as a brief distraction from their grief.", "Irrelevant: having a car or not, what questions SIL asked, whether you would have announced anyway, your intentions. \n\nRelevant: Your *actions* hurt someone you care about and you made it about you instead of the people you hurt. \n\nThe only correct response was \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I was thoughtless and caused you pain. I want to help you both in any way I can.\u201d \n\nYour self centered response to your grieving brother and SIL  and the  fact you are here asking what-about-meeee questions instead of focusing on them makes this a hard YTA.", "The house was some distance from the department store, and I did not have a car. I had used a taxi to reach the store.", "We wanted to go there soon after hearing the news instead of returning to our house (which was a considerable distance away) to leave them, which would have taken time.", "A pregnancy pillow. It was my first purchase, because I had pelvic pain that started sorry early in my pregnancies. They're big and chonky and not easy to disguise. \n\nMaybe some maternity clothes that are in bags from stores that are quite clearly marketed to pregnant mums and babies. \n\nSo I've thought of two things without really putting any effort in. I'm sure there's other stuff I've not thought of.", "He got to the store and their house via taxi, according to his comments", "If it was close enough to be affordable to reach by taxi, it was close enough to drop your purchases back at home.  \n\nI get that it you didn\u2019t intend to hurt them but you exercised poor judgement on this one.  Your refusal to acknowledge that and apologize is kind of baffling. YTA", "Why not send your wife home to drop the items off and you got to your brothers? And what were the items?", "So you didn't want to return everything you had spent time shopping for, which is understandable. What I don't understand...\n\nYou couldn't have bought a back pack/tote bag/luggage/reusable shopping bag/pillow case to hide your stuff in and make the purchases less obvious?\n\nHow about a generic gift bag to stick them in? That way if asked you could easily say you were picking up a gift for an acquaintance or something. What if you had them wrapped so you could justify not showing the contents?\n\nI bet if you asked, an associate would have put aside the purchases for you, possibly with online purchased in-store pick up items, for you to retrieve at another time so all you had to do was hold on to a receipt, which could be easily hidden.\n\nAnother option was to leave it outside their door on the porch/behind a plant.\n\nYou're about to have a child...your brother was in your shoes less than a year ago and you couldn't imagine that if you are so thrilled now, how devastated they must be? How baby things must be jumping out at them? Your presence was a bag of salt being rubbed in their wound. Showing up after going home with some food and snacks to help them stay strong would have been much more helpful than this immediate rush to their side.\n\nETA: your title makes it sound like this horrible event happened a while back, not your immediate response at the onset of their grief. So YTA no matter how you look at it, but the misleading nature of your title is more than enough to justify it already.", "I mean you could have left them in your car.", "YTA. That was a poor decision. The extra time it would have taken to go home first, have the taxi wait out front for 60 seconds while you drop the bags in your home, and then go on to your brothers would have been a minor inconvenience.\n\nYou knew they were grieving the death of their newborn, and you showed up at their house with pregnancy related purchases. Incredibly tone deaf and inconsiderate.", "I haven\u2019t been pregnant in years and still wear maternity clothes bc I like how the shirts are longer. Maternity pillows are used by all kinds of people who have back pain and hip pain.", "Hmmmm, interesting development. \n\nStill feels like they should\u2019ve had the sense to take the items elsewhere first. Probs wasn\u2019t thinking about it and just focusing on getting to his brother quickly. \n\nI think it\u2019s more a case of stupidity than asshole behaviour. \n\nNTA, but also kinda the unintentional asshole.", "I don\u2019t know, if I just found out my sibling\u2019s kid died I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d have the wherewithal to think much about what I have in my shopping bags, and to plan to bring them somewhere else in anticipation of being asked about their contents. \n\nWhat I\u2019m confused about is what OP bought that screams \u201cnewly pregnant woman,\u201d that can\u2019t be just explained away. Maternity clothes are just \u201cclothes,\u201d pre-natal vitamins are just \u201cvitamins.\u201d", "I do not have a car, I used a taxi to reach the store.", "Am I understanding this correctly? You bought everything, then stuffed yourself and the supplies in the taxi and just carried it around during the visit?", "you could of went home first, be more considerate yta"]}
