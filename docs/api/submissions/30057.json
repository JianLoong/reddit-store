It sounds like she's projecting onto you.\n\n\"She said that since I am 31 years old, I should be independent and face the challenges of life like her instead of being a burden on my parents.\"\n\nYou are.  Just in a way she doesn't approve of.  I'm the same.  I live at home with my parents.  It works for us.  They get help with the house and a reliable source of income for maintenance/utilities.  I get lower rent than elsewhere and no pet fee.  I much prefer paying rent to my parents rather than a random landlord.  As long as you and your parents are happy well done.  Ignore your sister.\n\nOn another note I'm wondering if you're doubting yourself because you think of your home country as third world.  That's now largely regarded as a derogatory term.  I'd suggest reframing it as 'developing country' or 'low-to-middle income country'.  May seem silly or finicky but words matter.  They can really shape how we think about things."]}
