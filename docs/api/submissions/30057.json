It sounds like she's projecting onto you.\n\n\"She said that since I am 31 years old, I should be independent and face the challenges of life like her instead of being a burden on my parents.\"\n\nYou are.  Just in a way she doesn't approve of.  I'm the same.  I live at home with my parents.  It works for us.  They get help with the house and a reliable source of income for maintenance/utilities.  I get lower rent than elsewhere and no pet fee.  I much prefer paying rent to my parents rather than a random landlord.  As long as you and your parents are happy well done.  Ignore your sister.\n\nOn another note I'm wondering if you're doubting yourself because you think of your home country as third world.  That's now largely regarded as a derogatory term.  I'd suggest reframing it as 'developing country' or 'low-to-middle income country'.  May seem silly or finicky but words matter.  They can really shape how we think about things.", "NTA.  She has options. She chooses to not use them and insult you instead. She can whine all she wants. Ignore her.", "NTA- Are you morally wrong for living in one property with family instead of two, thus consuming less overall resources, financially contributing to the comfort of their lifestyle, and being on hand if anything happens and they need help?

You said it, you're paying your own way. Your parents aren't supporting you, quite the opposite.

She, who just decided to not work, is not a burden?  Hahahahaha.  \n\nNTA.

Every family is different; don't use someone else's measuring stick to measure your success. You have a lovely arrangement with your parents. There is no virtue in misery, and your sister is demonstrating that with how she's treating you. And please don't let how she views your country affect how you view it. What matters is you're doing well for yourself and right by the people around you. She sounds like she's not doing either of those things.", "Lol a subscriber of misery loves company made me laugh, stealing that", "I like this take"]}
