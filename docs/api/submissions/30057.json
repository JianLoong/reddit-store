It sounds like she's projecting onto you.\n\n\"She said that since I am 31 years old, I should be independent and face the challenges of life like her instead of being a burden on my parents.\"\n\nYou are.  Just in a way she doesn't approve of.  I'm the same.  I live at home with my parents.  It works for us.  They get help with the house and a reliable source of income for maintenance/utilities.  I get lower rent than elsewhere and no pet fee.  I much prefer paying rent to my parents rather than a random landlord.  As long as you and your parents are happy well done.  Ignore your sister.\n\nOn another note I'm wondering if you're doubting yourself because you think of your home country as third world.  That's now largely regarded as a derogatory term.  I'd suggest reframing it as 'developing country' or 'low-to-middle income country'.  May seem silly or finicky but words matter.  They can really shape how we think about things.", "NTA.  She has options. She chooses to not use them and insult you instead. She can whine all she wants. Ignore her.", "NTA- Are you morally wrong for living in one property with family instead of two, thus consuming less overall resources, financially contributing to the comfort of their lifestyle, and being on hand if anything happens and they need help? Er, no babe, you're sound!", "Nta", "Independent like her? She's not independent. Your sister is a dependant of her husband. You are helping your parents with a necessary expense.\nNTA.", "NTA. You said it, you're paying your own way. Your parents aren't supporting you, quite the opposite. I'm sure they appreciate the extra income and the help.   \nYour sister's thinking is warped by her situation and jealousy.", ">She called me \u201cmentally disabled\u201d in a fit of anger, for living with my parents while she has to struggle with her husband financially.\n\nShe decided not to work again. You moved to have an easier life. She can do the same but doesn't want to, what does that have to do with you?

She, who just decided to not work, is not a burden?  Hahahahaha.  \n\nNTA.  Also, fyi, moving back to your country will not help them because they don\u2019t want to work. \nLive a good life, OP, and limit contact with Sister Woe-Is-Me.", "NTA and please don't feel bad for doing what's right for you and your family. Every family is different; don't use someone else's measuring stick to measure your success. You have a lovely arrangement with your parents. There is no virtue in misery, and your sister is demonstrating that with how she's treating you. And please don't let how she views your country affect how you view it. What matters is you're doing well for yourself and right by the people around you. She sounds like she's not doing either of those things.", "Lol a subscriber of misery loves company made me laugh, stealing that", "I like this take", "Nta - when I was 29 I moved back with my parents and saved for a house deposit . I lived there for a year . We all enjoyed it , I did the cooking, paid my extra bills and we had a great time together . I feel no shame about . This idea we must seperate from our families is dumb . If everyone is happy with the arrangement who cares what you \u201cshould do \u201c\nI know have my mortgage and I think fondly of the year we lived together", "NTA\nIs your sister sending money home? Is she there 24/7 helping out while your mom is ill? I doubt it.\n\nYou made the adult choice. You look at your situation and made a financially responsible decision that benefits you and your family.\n\nYour sister is struggling with a kind of childish idealism about what it means to be an adult. She doesn't have a job. Her husband barely has a functioning business, but the illusion of independence and living in a country people likely admire is more important to her than reality.\n\n\nYour sister hasn't learned that it's not more adult to be starving/going into debt/completely stressed out in a supposedly more economically advanced country than it is live within your means.", "NTA... have your parents life improved since your return?  Are they happy to share their home? Do you treat them well? I'm thinking so. \n\nYou did the math and decided that living simply in a 3rd world country was less stressful then running in the rat race of a 1st world country.  Sounds like you chose wisely.  Congratulations", "NTA", "You should face the life chalanges like her by quitting your job, getting a partner to rely on, and complaining to everyone who would listen about how hard your life is and not do anything about it? \n\nNTA. Give me a break. You're paying your parents rent, and since you live with them, I assume you also help them with chores around the house. How are you a burden to them, really? She's like one of those people who would rather complain about their lives than do something about improving it, and everyone around them should struggle because she is struggling.", "Just one thing:   If I were your sister's husband I would explore absolutely ANY alternative to moving to a country where I'd not only be living with my in-laws, but my in-laws would be the only people I knew!  I'd go before I ended up living in a tent on the street, but not before those were my only options.\n\nSo by all means tell your sister that you're happy with your life as it is, but please, don't ever come across as smug, or act tell her she's being silly for wanting to stay where she is.  The two of you are already fighting across international borders, which is probably one reason your sister doesn't want to come, and of course her husband is probably resisting the idea of moving with all his strength.", "You're paying rent to your parents.  You buy groceries and for your parents as well since you're not going to tell them \"sorry all that food is mine\".\n\nThis also helps your parents and you, it cuts their expenses some,  you pay less than if you had your own place,  and everyone can save some money.  \n\nDid you ask your sister exactly why she believes you are a burden to your parents?  Without examples of what you're doing to be a burden, makes her sound jealous. \n\nIf your sister doesn't want to struggle than one of them has to get a job while trying to build the business.  Actually they both should be woking - husband could get a part-time.  But she'd rather complain and call you names. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with living in a third world to be stress free and financially in a better place. And if your parents need assistance,  you're right there. \n\nIn the US,  many adult \"children\" live with there parents. Cost of living is high. Some want to save money for a home. Some have aging parents who want someone living with them. Pooling money together. Some live at home until they get married.  And way more reasons. All of those reasons are good reasons.\n\nYou're paying rent and buying food, you are not taking advantage of your parents. \n\nYour sister needs to focus on herself and not you. \n\nNTA"]}
