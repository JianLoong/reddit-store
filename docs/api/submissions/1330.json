{"id": 1330, "submission_id": "ym8j8r", "title": "WIBTA for stealing my cat from my parent's house?", "selftext": " \n\nMy (F25) 19 year old cat Belle was given to me as a Christmas present when she was just a kitten. Technically, she was a \u2018family\u2019 present and my mom says that Belle is her cat. However, as I\u2019ve gotten older and my parents have gone on trips and such, Belle has become my best friend. \n\nAfter I moved out of the house, I worried she would forget about me (she has short term memory and brain damage). But she still comes running when I open the front door and she never leaves me alone while I visit with my family. She is constantly meowing and demanding attention from me. It\u2019s been six months and she still hasn\u2019t gotten used to me not being in the house full time. \n\nNeither of my parents pay attention to her much. They both work from home, but my mom shuts the door when Belle annoys her (which is often) and my dad will kick her out of his office. They haven\u2019t played with her since I moved out. One of her toys is still in the exact same spot I left it in April. She\u2019s affection starved and anxious, mostly because she\u2019s just very clingy in her old age and wants constant love. \n\nThis anxiety is what leads me to the main problem. She continually poops outside of the litter box, which obviously isn\u2019t normal. In the past, we\u2019ve tried moving the litter box around and that has worked. But now, suddenly, my dad is saying that she is ruining the carpet and she\u2019s either going to change her behavior or he\u2019s going to get rid of her. My mom (who I have been fighting for years in order to keep Belle) took her to the vet but won\u2019t share what he said with me. When I offered to take her, they were both absolutely vehement that they wouldn\u2019t give her up willingly. Even when my boyfriend said he had space for her, they refused. There\u2019s only two options, according to them: she either changes her ways, or she\u2019s gone. \n\nI am terrified of losing my sweet kitty. She\u2019ll be so scared in a shelter, alone without anyone she knows, and I don\u2019t know that anyone would want to adopt such an old lady. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her besides her heart, which she is on medication for. I don\u2019t know how my vet would react if my parents demand that he put her down, I hope he would refuse. I just don\u2019t know. \n\nWIBTA if I just go over and take her without my parents\u2019 permission? I have supplies to take care of her, a nice place, and plenty of time to give her all the attention she wants. I know that she\u2019ll be much happier with me, and I would prefer to have her with me to live out the rest of her life rather than in a cage in a shelter.", "created_utc": 1667591459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym8j8r/wibta_for_stealing_my_cat_from_my_parents_house/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents are AHs for claiming they would dump the cat off a shelter instead of having her humanely euthanized or letting you have her. You are unrealistic if you think a 19 year old cat with brain damage and heart problems and that poops outside the box doesn\u2019t have a limited amount of time left. Problem is, I don\u2019t know if moving her from the physical home she\u2019s had for 19 years would be much kinder than a shelter. But if parents are serious about throwing her away, I say take her, pamper her and have her humanely put down when the time comes.  Just know you\u2019ll catch hell from your parents and watching Bella decline will break your heart.", "Info: do shelters check for microchips?\n\nIf you could sneak her away and get her microchipped and they surrender her to a shelter, would that guarantee they would contact you?", "NTA\n\nLegally you may not have much ground to stand on- but I doubt your parents actually care enough to take you to court over this.\n\nGet her microchipped, and take her to a new vet for the paper trail.", "Get. \n\nYour. \n\nCat.", "NTA !!

If they're going to \"get rid of her\", why would they care if you have her?", "Not a matter of being an AH, but what is best for the kitty. Sounds like your parents, at least father is not handling this well. I took one look at the age and was ready to swear up and down you would be, but then I read the rest.\n\nAlways planned on taking my cat with me when I moved out. But mom Sat me down and told me point blank this had been her home for 15 years, she's not going anywhere. It made sense. \n\nBut it sounds like kitty would be better in your care. In this case uprooting kitty would be traumatizing yes, but much less so than being shipped off to a shelter. Give the old girl the best golden years. She deserves it \n\nSometimes it's worth it to be the AH, justifiable AH, but not as much as your parents .", "NTA. This makes no sense. Your parents don't want the cat yet won't let her go to someone who wants her.  They're jerks for threatening to dump a pet the family has had for years.\n Is there some conflict you didn't include? Are they mad at you for moving out or something? \nIn any case get the cat.\nJust read your other entry about your parents. Their refusal to give you the cat and their threats are definitely revenge. Get the cat ASAP", "Your parents\u2019 seem to be stuck on two options: your cat changes her behaviour or she is sent to a shelter/put down? Why is your option not a feasible option for them? This is a weird stance.\n\nI think the wellbeing of the cat trumps all. Go get her, take her to a vet, and give her the unconditional love she deserves.

If she were to be somewhere and someone found her and took her to vet, I believe a vet would check for a microchip."]}
