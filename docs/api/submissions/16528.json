We were married for 14 years. We have 2 children together, 11 & 14. This is very abbreviated because of the character limit.\n\n4 months before the separation we had bought a farm together, & his mother gifted us $10k for the down payment. A couple months after living on the farm I learned boundaries were crossed by him (again) & we agreed that it was time for him to leave. We came to an agreement that he would only have to pay me $150 per month for child support, I didn't want him to struggle while he got back on his feet. We were both low income then.\n\n2019 taxes were reassessed on the farm, I no longer could afford it so I decided to sell the house.  Moved. Ex had no qualms.  I thought it was fair that I would pay him back half of the down payment gift & 4 months worth of equity in the house. So we didn't have to swap money back & forth, I just let him withhold payments. This was the beginning of the pandemic. I had a loss of income, but lower cost of living in the new town + credit made it do-able. I was not able to get any government assistance because I didn't have a child support order through the courts. \n\n2021 divorce is final,  we had written in the original child support agreement. I've had many people tell me that him not paying support is bad, but I didn't want to harm him. There were conversations about him paying more, but he insisted that he couldn't. We decided he would make the full 100mi drive for swaps instead. I have the kids 78% of time. \n\n2023, we moved in with my current partner. Ex's rent went up & he moved even farther. He started asking me to reconsider the half way swap again. I feel taken advantage of, I really am doing everything for the kids- he had no interest in helping me, our son is special needs and in a multitude of therapies. Ex will pay me half of medical things and extracurriculars, but has only paid me one lump in 6 months. He says that I now live in a two income household so I can wait. I remind him my partner is not the children's dad.\n\nI look at a child support calculator. Last month I finished paying off the farm. I realize he's a federal employee and I can look up his income, and I found he is making $30K more than I thought. This means that he has been lying to me for years about his income.  My income has also gone up since 2018 but it wasn't until this year that I finally got a promotion that substantially increased my salary. Ex makes $15K more.  There was a point where he was making double what I was. Now he should be paying me around $1K per month. Back then it should have been around $3K.  \n\nI told him what I found & he started fighting me. \"He can't afford it.\" The first thing he said was \"If you go through the court I will not drive to you.\"  He told me that even the suggestion of going to court has violated his trust, I can't squeeze water out of a rock.
