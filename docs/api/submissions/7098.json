You tried to keep things private but they were intent on harassing you so you gave them the reason. If they\u2019re embarrassed that\u2019s their problem.

Your private business should have been your private business, but some people apparently felt they had the right to insert themselves into it anyway \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they wouldn't have been humiliated if they had minded their own damn business.", "NTA, they asked, you answered.", "NTA", "Eh, they kinda kept asking why you wouldn't let them meet, they shouldn't get mad if you give them a sincere answer.

My son was the primary recipient of my ex's actions.", "NTA. You \u201chumiliated\u201d them because they decided to get involved in the situation without having all the facts. That\u2019s on them.", "nta \ngood on you", "NTA. They were the ones out of line for harassing you without knowing the full details of the situation. You were quiet for as long as you could be, but they continued to harass you. You spoke nothing but the truth. How can they be mad at you for telling the truth? They should apologize to you as they were the ones that were behaving out of line. Good luck!\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA.\n\nAnd you should tell the prosecutor in your ex\u2019s case that he is continuing to harass you by having friends and family contact you.

Not even close to being the AH. I presume the list is the type that means he stays a long way from schools. And then they try to call you out on it? He's going to make the newspapers and local news.

The truth hurts, too bad they all had to be AH's to find out what is really happening.", "NTA. I presume those charges are all public anyhow? So it's not like you aired any laundry that wasn't already hanging out there for everyone to see if they wanted to. Those people that are upset were also upset when you tried to take the private approach. So sounds like you wouldn't have made them happy no matter how you addressed the issue.", "NTA.  I am surprised your ex didn\u2019t see this as the natural progression of events, once he started encouraging others to harass you.  Did he really think you would be bullied into submission by others when he had serious criminal charges pending that you were aware of.  Unless you were legally precluded from talking about the pending charges, what did he expect.  Tell the stragglers that are still harassing you to go to hell.  I hope he is shortly no longer a problem you have to deal with.", "NTA. There are ways to find out folks' wrongdoings depending on the situation (e.g., any media coverage, some states list court dates with pending charges listed, etc.), but at the crux of it all, he's being manipulative as hell with the sob story.\n\nHe needs to own his shit (but of course it sounds like he never will). My half-brother is this type, multiple convictions of horrific crimes against others, but he's *always* the victim, according to him. So reading this is very unsurprising.\n\nYou shouldn't have been subjected to their bullshit and I would've lost my patience long ago so I might be in a minority with this opinion, but I think it's great when someone's exposed for who they are.\n\nEdit: I see now I'm not in the minority.

They get involved and then complain about your involvement. Utter nonsense.  I assume based on the list mention it's a sex offender thing. Either way get full custody if you don't legally have it and work on a restraining order.", "Holy cow, absolutely NTA.  Remember when people were spreading lies and misinformation about CoVID and social media had to start fact-checking?  That\u2019s what you did.  It was necessary, and it was *asked for*.  As for ones that got burned and are mad?  It\u2019s not your fault they promoted a bunch of lies in public, tell them to complain to your ex.", "Considering they all have kids, I hope it also gives them a wake up call", "I'm a wreck over having to go to court.

And anybody who matters has my number.", "I posted the pictures of the papers of the official charges. I'm not going to lie about anyone.", "Oh hell.

Hopefully you and your son can get into therapy for a little while to help.", "Got it. There's an opinion I have about such people, but rules, and stuff.", "I'm quite positive my ex never told anyone that he's having those charges pressed against him. Especially since pretty much everyone he knows has children.", "Yes, it is that kind of list. Far away from schools and any place designed for children to be the target audience.", "Yes, they are public. I'm sure my ex didn't tell anyone about the charges, instead he'd rather make me into the villain.", "It really should. Imagine if something had happened and you'd not said anything - you'd have then got the blame for not telling people.", "Excellent, then everything sounds fine.", "Therapy lots of therapy for my son, plus lots of anger and tears.
