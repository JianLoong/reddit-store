She's due this summer. Months ago they told us (close family and friends) the name they had chosen. We thought it was a great name and SIL was saying how happy she was. My brother made a comment about us knowing for the baby shower and in case gifts were being purchased. So my mom, sister and I bought some items with the name. SILs mom, who is disabled and chronically ill, spent months knitting a blanket with the name. I also found a sign I knew SIL wanted and bought that as a gift for them.\n\nThen with a week before the baby shower my brother announces he no longer wanted the name and it was going to change. SIL was so upset. The rest of us were shocked and then I was pissed. He let so many people spend money on stuff, because he knew we were using the name on gifts and stuff, and never said a damn thing. Turns out he never liked the name. He just wanted the middle name and then could no longer live with his wife's first choice for boy name.\n\nThe girls arranging the baby shower lost out on some money with that so they were also pissed.\n\nMy brother was complaining about everyone dogpiling on him and he told me I had no right to be pissed at him. I started to yell saying he had let people get used to the name, had known we were buying/making items with the name all the while he knew he didn't like it, and then he turns around a week before the event with the money spent on banners and stuff and says oh well, I don't like it. I told him what he allowed his MIL to do knowing how much it must have been a struggle for her and still decides to change the name like it's nothing. Even seeing how much it upset his wife. I told him I was not buying more damn gifts. And that he better get used to people not liking him very much because he can't just do that in a flippant manner and expect people to be okay.\n\nHe told me I was being unfair and it's not like he was born. I said don't fucking announce it then and let people use it for months. Don't bring up gifts with the name because that makes it feel like an even bigger done deal. I told him he could always pay us back for what we bought and the time invested since HE changed his mind. He told me I was overreacting and I told him he knows deep down I'm right when everyone is mad at him. He even let slip that SIL has been cooler toward him since. \n\nHe told me I was an asshole and I was making it seem like he's a monster for changing his mind.

Your brother\u2019s dishonesty will do lasting damage to his relationship with her and while, yes, he\u2019s allowed to change his mind, that\u2019s not exactly what happened here. He had doubts about the name from the beginning. He doesn\u2019t get to be the victim here now that people are pissed. You probably shouldn\u2019t have yelled at him or piled on about the financial aspect (considering that the name itself is more important than money spent), but someone needed to tell him that he screwed up royally overall so I give you a pass on your delivery.

SIL should give the kid the original name and let your brother lump it. It\u2019s fair enough for him to not like a name. It\u2019s not fair enough for him to say yes to the name and then renege at the last minute having already effectively demanded personalised baby gifts from everybody.", "Yeah your brother is the AH.\n\nHe didn't just mention a name they were *considering*, he announced it as the name they had agreed on AND even mentioned that people might get gifts for the baby shower with the name on!!!\n\nTo then change his mind, and not understand why people would be pissed off with wasted money and especially the huge effort from his MIL is bizarre!\n\nHe really can't understand why people are upset?????", "NTA\n\nThe issue is not his right to change his mind on a name. But how he went about it.\n\nYou can't tell people a done name, ask for (or make it obvious you want) gifts with the said name imprinted on it, and then with little to no notice, change it. It strikes harder than he is changing a name let alone his family, his wife loves. He is upsetting his wife over this.", "NTA.\n\n\nYour brother just unilaterally decided to change the baby name? What the hell.  Why doesn't your SIL have a say to it? \n\nYour brother is a major asshole", "I think your brother went about this very poorly, but he\u2019s allowed to do what he did - to change his mind about his child\u2019s name, even after he\u2019s told people. He was right to make that choice rather than live with a name he doesn\u2019t like. \n\nHowever, when he told everyone, then changed the name, he totally became an AH who doesn\u2019t care about inconveniencing other people. His partner, in particular.  Everyone else maybe should\u2019ve just given the monogrammed stuff with the old name. What a strange, AH-ish way to proceed. \n\nNTA", ">My brother made a comment about us knowing for the baby shower and in case gifts were being purchased.\n\nYeah, well if he explicitly said that then NTA if he didn't tell you he'd changed his mind.\n\nI don't see what the big deal is anyway - It could have been funny, and it's not like the baby can't use the stuff with a different name on it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe seeing all of the gifts everyone got with the name and the effort would show him just how much of an AH he is being", "He\u2019s abusing his pregnant spouse. NTA and it\u2019s not his choice alone.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you put him in his place about it.", "I may be underestimating the amount of money spent, but I'm going YTA because the brother was never okay with the name and probably only went with it because the wife liked the name. He probably discussed how much he didn't like it with her before it was announced to everyone. He told you the name because he was supporting his wife, but at this point he can't hold it in any longer. I get y'all spent money, but he's not bad for wanting his child to have a decent name and the way you ripped into him shows you're getting too involved with his baby. Now I'm sorry people lost money, but return items you can and give them the items you can't despite the wrong name. I'm sure they'll still use it.", "ESH\n\nYour only offense is yelling at your brother. You are justifiably very upset, but I just think that yelling almost always makes things worse.\n\nYour brother is the far bigger AH if he doesn't understand why everyone is upset.", "I hate to think what the women who were organizing the baby shower paid. I know SIL has been offering us all money but she's not the person I blame for any of this and I think my brother is extra shitty for leaving that to her. She feels terrible and I can tell she's super upset he let her use the name for so long.", "Is he entitled to change the name on a whim? Multiple people understood his statement to imply certainty about the child's name, and invested time in money in that name. Even if that's not what he intended, when you miss on communication that badly, maybe the graceful thing to do is just to accept that it's a perfectly fine name that people have already gotten used to. \"It takes a village\" works both ways; when the village is invested in your child, you're an AH if you completely disregard the village's feelings", "I\u2019d still be having a baby shower with all the original name stuff. He can pay for replacements if he hates it so much.", "Not a problem. The baby can't read yet so he won't be confused by the name. I'm sure the gifts are still useful as they are", "Right? Like all that time and I know from talking to her that some days she struggled but she really wanted it to be ready for the shower and definitely before he was born.", "He is. She's been so upset over this and she already told him he doesn't get the middle name of his choice if the first name has to be a big compromise for her. That they will just need to compromise on both. But she has admitted she's struggling to think of their son as a different name after all this time.\n\nShe's also embarrassed about the money and time spent. I can only imagine how bad she feels for her friends paying for the shower and her mom who dedicated all that time to the blanket.", "None of us really see it as funny. SIL sure doesn't and I'm betting her friends who paid for the shower don't. Sure, technically the stuff could be used but it would be so weird to go around where the only stuff with the name on them isn't even the name. Even the sign for the nursery. He could have saved a lot of annoyance if he had said something way sooner.", "That is not the point. Things can be used. Gifts can be given. That is true. The problem is getting people to put  a lot of effort and feelings for something you ask them, and then changing everything the last minute and expect people to not feel dissapointed.", "No, he used the name because he wanted a specific middle name his wife doesn't like. So he pulled a name from her list so they could compromise and he told her he had a change of heart on the name. She even double and triple checked with him. But he went ahead and said it was good. Then he brings up buying gifts.\n\nIt's not just money. His disabled MIL spent months on that blanket. His wife's friends spent a ton of money on the baby shower.\n\nAnd his wife is going around trying to make things right when she still wants to use the name.", "So I have to ask does that mean he gets his choice of both middle and first names now? I\u2019m seriously suggesting couples therapy for them both so he either stops being an arse or she gets the bravery to leave him. \nSprry", "Kid won\u2019t be in daycare anytime soon so wrong name is not so big deal", "That\u2019s heartbreaking. He seems a bit unhinged if he thinks you guys are the AHs, she sounds amazing. Was it a unique name? Could things be sold on? Not her handiwork but the baby shower things?", "Tell her to agree to the name her husband wants. The middle name is the one she wanted. \n\nAnd then everyone can give him their gifts and \u201cnickname\u201d him the middle name. \n\nThough that might be throwing gasoline on a fire", "So can the middle name be the one your SIL wanted as first name? If so, you can all still give the gifts with that name and when the baby is born, call her/him (I don\u2019t remember if you have mentioned the gender or not) by that name and not the first name. (I call a few of my friends by their middle name because wither it is better or they like it more)", "That poor woman. I feel so bad for her having to deal with all this stress during an already physically and emotionally complicated time.", "If the wife double and triple checked with him then yeah he's the ahole.", "She told him he doesn't get the middle name if the first name is going to be a big compromise for her. Which it's likely going to be since it seems their styles are different. So no, he doesn't get both.", "It's not the most common name but not totally out there either. The baby shower things could not really be sold on because some were already put up in the venue so might not be used (since it was at one of the friends houses and she wanted to get things up early so she wouldn't be rushing at the last minute).", "She did. That's partly why she's so upset because he knew she loved the name and she didn't want to announce or use the name unless he was sure. Which he told her he was positive and he'd really come around to the name. She gave themselves a bit of time on the name before she said they could tell us and checked with him on it. He even had us convinced he was good with the name.", "Honestly I think she need to put her foot down and name the kid anyway.", "That\u2019s so bad. I\u2019m so sorry, honestly he should suck it up. It\u2019s not his name, he can choose the middle name, call the kid a nickname etc.", "Yeah I just assumed she offered the name and he just went with it. If she checked at multiple points to make sure he was okay with it can't defend him. It's weird he'd switch up like that at the last minute.", "The middle name is already his choice. He picked a name off SILs list so she was okay with the middle name he liked but she didn't. She thought it was only fair. But on top of all that she double and triple checked with him that he was good with the name before she wanted to tell people, because she knew he said no to it originally.", "Seems he grew to dislike the name more over time. It was the name she loved that he felt was the least bad to him. But he said it was just not a name he liked. Which is fine. But then don't try to make yourself like it and get everyone on board only to come clean after.", "yeah he honestly could've kept that to himself. Are they even going to change the name or did he just state that he didn't like it? If he got the middle name they need to stick to the deal and give the baby the first name the mom wants.", "He's saying they have to which is really upsetting to her. She told him he doesn't get to keep the middle name though since the name will have to be a compromise (the first name).", "Sheesh. Yeah I feel bad for Sil for having to deal with that. I hope things get solved because while money was the top concern in your post things are obviously deeper than that. Your brother is just controlling and is willing to inconvenience everyone to get his way."]}
