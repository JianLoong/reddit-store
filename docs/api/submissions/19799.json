She's due this summer. Months ago they told us (close family and friends) the name they had chosen. We thought it was a great name and SIL was saying how happy she was. My brother made a comment about us knowing for the baby shower and in case gifts were being purchased. So my mom, sister and I bought some items with the name. SILs mom, who is disabled and chronically ill, spent months knitting a blanket with the name. I also found a sign I knew SIL wanted and bought that as a gift for them.\n\nThen with a week before the baby shower my brother announces he no longer wanted the name and it was going to change. SIL was so upset. The rest of us were shocked and then I was pissed. He let so many people spend money on stuff, because he knew we were using the name on gifts and stuff, and never said a damn thing. Turns out he never liked the name. He just wanted the middle name and then could no longer live with his wife's first choice for boy name.\n\nThe girls arranging the baby shower lost out on some money with that so they were also pissed.\n\nMy brother was complaining about everyone dogpiling on him and he told me I had no right to be pissed at him. I started to yell saying he had let people get used to the name, had known we were buying/making items with the name all the while he knew he didn't like it, and then he turns around a week before the event with the money spent on banners and stuff and says oh well, I don't like it. I told him what he allowed his MIL to do knowing how much it must have been a struggle for her and still decides to change the name like it's nothing. Even seeing how much it upset his wife. I told him I was not buying more damn gifts. And that he better get used to people not liking him very much because he can't just do that in a flippant manner and expect people to be okay.\n\nHe told me I was being unfair and it's not like he was born. I said don't fucking announce it then and let people use it for months. Don't bring up gifts with the name because that makes it feel like an even bigger done deal. I told him he could always pay us back for what we bought and the time invested since HE changed his mind. He told me I was overreacting and I told him he knows deep down I'm right when everyone is mad at him. He even let slip that SIL has been cooler toward him since. \n\nHe told me I was an asshole and I was making it seem like he's a monster for changing his mind.

NTA and it\u2019s not his choice alone.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you put him in his place about it.", "I may be underestimating the amount of money spent, but I'm going YTA because the brother was never okay with the name and probably only went with it because the wife liked the name. He probably discussed how much he didn't like it with her before it was announced to everyone. He told you the name because he was supporting his wife, but at this point he can't hold it in any longer. I get y'all spent money, but he's not bad for wanting his child to have a decent name and the way you ripped into him shows you're getting too involved with his baby. Now I'm sorry people lost money, but return items you can and give them the items you can't despite the wrong name. I'm sure they'll still use it.", "ESH\n\nYour only offense is yelling at your brother. You are justifiably very upset, but I just think that yelling almost always makes things worse.\n\nYour brother is the far bigger AH if he doesn't understand why everyone is upset.", "I hate to think what the women who were organizing the baby shower paid. I know SIL has been offering us all money but she's not the person I blame for any of this and I think my brother is extra shitty for leaving that to her. She feels terrible and I can tell she's super upset he let her use the name for so long.", "Is he entitled to change the name on a whim? Multiple people understood his statement to imply certainty about the child's name, and invested time in money in that name. Even if that's not what he intended, when you miss on communication that badly, maybe the graceful thing to do is just to accept that it's a perfectly fine name that people have already gotten used to. \"It takes a village\" works both ways; when the village is invested in your child, you're an AH if you completely disregard the village's feelings", "I\u2019d still be having a baby shower with all the original name stuff. He can pay for replacements if he hates it so much.", "Not a problem. The baby can't read yet so he won't be confused by the name. I'm sure the gifts are still useful as they are", "Right? Like all that time and I know from talking to her that some days she struggled but she really wanted it to be ready for the shower and definitely before he was born.", "He is. She's been so upset over this and she already told him he doesn't get the middle name of his choice if the first name has to be a big compromise for her. That they will just need to compromise on both. But she has admitted she's struggling to think of their son as a different name after all this time.\n\nShe's also embarrassed about the money and time spent. I can only imagine how bad she feels for her friends paying for the shower and her mom who dedicated all that time to the blanket.", "None of us really see it as funny. SIL sure doesn't and I'm betting her friends who paid for the shower don't. Sure, technically the stuff could be used but it would be so weird to go around where the only stuff with the name on them isn't even the name. Even the sign for the nursery. He could have saved a lot of annoyance if he had said something way sooner.", "That is not the point. Things can be used. Gifts can be given. That is true. The problem is getting people to put  a lot of effort and feelings for something you ask them, and then changing everything the last minute and expect people to not feel dissapointed.", "No, he used the name because he wanted a specific middle name his wife doesn't like. So he pulled a name from her list so they could compromise and he told her he had a change of heart on the name. She even double and triple checked with him. But he went ahead and said it was good. Then he brings up buying gifts.\n\nIt's not just money. His disabled MIL spent months on that blanket. His wife's friends spent a ton of money on the baby shower.\n\nAnd his wife is going around trying to make things right when she still wants to use the name.", "So I have to ask does that mean he gets his choice of both middle and first names now? I\u2019m seriously suggesting couples therapy for them both so he either stops being an arse or she gets the bravery to leave him. \nSprry", "Kid won\u2019t be in daycare anytime soon so wrong name is not so big deal", "That\u2019s heartbreaking. He seems a bit unhinged if he thinks you guys are the AHs, she sounds amazing. Was it a unique name? Could things be sold on? Not her handiwork but the baby shower things?", "Tell her to agree to the name her husband wants. The middle name is the one she wanted. \n\nAnd then everyone can give him their gifts and \u201cnickname\u201d him the middle name. \n\nThough that might be throwing gasoline on a fire", "So can the middle name be the one your SIL wanted as first name? If so, you can all still give the gifts with that name and when the baby is born, call her/him (I don\u2019t remember if you have mentioned the gender or not) by that name and not the first name. (I call a few of my friends by their middle name because wither it is better or they like it more)", "That poor woman. I feel so bad for her having to deal with all this stress during an already physically and emotionally complicated time.", "If the wife double and triple checked with him then yeah he's the ahole.", "She told him he doesn't get the middle name if the first name is going to be a big compromise for her. Which it's likely going to be since it seems their styles are different. So no, he doesn't get both.", "It's not the most common name but not totally out there either. The baby shower things could not really be sold on because some were already put up in the venue so might not be used (since it was at one of the friends houses and she wanted to get things up early so she wouldn't be rushing at the last minute).", "She did. That's partly why she's so upset because he knew she loved the name and she didn't want to announce or use the name unless he was sure. Which he told her he was positive and he'd really come around to the name. She gave themselves a bit of time on the name before she said they could tell us and checked with him on it. He even had us convinced he was good with the name.", "Honestly I think she need to put her foot down and name the kid anyway.", "That\u2019s so bad. I\u2019m so sorry, honestly he should suck it up. It\u2019s not his name, he can choose the middle name, call the kid a nickname etc.", "Yeah I just assumed she offered the name and he just went with it. If she checked at multiple points to make sure he was okay with it can't defend him. It's weird he'd switch up like that at the last minute.", "The middle name is already his choice. He picked a name off SILs list so she was okay with the middle name he liked but she didn't. She thought it was only fair. But on top of all that she double and triple checked with him that he was good with the name before she wanted to tell people, because she knew he said no to it originally.", "Seems he grew to dislike the name more over time. It was the name she loved that he felt was the least bad to him. But he said it was just not a name he liked. Which is fine. But then don't try to make yourself like it and get everyone on board only to come clean after.", "yeah he honestly could've kept that to himself. Are they even going to change the name or did he just state that he didn't like it? If he got the middle name they need to stick to the deal and give the baby the first name the mom wants.", "He's saying they have to which is really upsetting to her. She told him he doesn't get to keep the middle name though since the name will have to be a compromise (the first name).", "Sheesh. Yeah I feel bad for Sil for having to deal with that. I hope things get solved because while money was the top concern in your post things are obviously deeper than that. Your brother is just controlling and is willing to inconvenience everyone to get his way.", "Frankly I would give him the shower and gifts with the name on it and be done. If he wants to change it then fine but he wouldn't have any more money thrown at the change of plan. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother is a deeply selfish AH. The time to speak up was when they were deciding the name and definitely before they announced it and asked people to buy monogrammed items. Aside from how inconsiderate it is to everyone around him, it is a a really, really shitty thing to do to his wife. He didn't even apologise or take responsibility; he left it to his pregnant wife to deal with the fall out. And letting his MIL hand make a blanket with the name is far, far worse IMO than wasting everyone's money or his delusional expectation that everyone should buy new gifts without the name. Your poor SIL.", "I don't think I will ever understand people choosing a name for a baby that hasn't been born yet. \n\nI totally get having preferences and dream names, and defo discussing with the other parent but like, surely everything can change the first time you see them, when you finally get to know them", "NTA- he knew what he was doing when he knew about the extra efforts being made. Should have spoken up before hand. Cant be made at everyone for not being happy with your choice", "[removed]", "It\u2019s not fair enough for him to say yes to the name and then renege at the last minute having already effectively demanded personalised baby gifts from everybody.", "Aside from how inconsiderate it is to everyone around him, it is a a really, really shitty thing to do to his wife.", "He didn't even apologise or take responsibility; he left it to his pregnant wife to deal with the fall out.", "ESH", "He\u2019s not a monster, but he is TA.\nPoor sister in law.

I would still gift everything with that name on it and when he grows up and asks your brother can explain. \n\n\nThat being said; let it be lesson to not count your chickens before they hatch.  Until the name is on the birth certificate I personally wouldn't take it seriously, regardless of how much the parents insist.  So many things can happen before. I don't even trust the gender until the baby is born (even if the bloodtest is accurate).", "NTA.\n\nBut brother probably didn't like it from the start but allowed himself to be convinced by SIL, then when it got close it got too real and he said what he really thought.\n\nHas he said why he's so against the name, plz?", "Nta.  But he does deserve one more gift from you: a can of whoopass.", "NTA. Tell SIL to just swap the name to baby\u2019s middle name and call him that.

This would be one case I'd be OK with him having no say.", "NTA. He IS the asshole, and everyone in your family is telling him that, why doesn't he get it?  \nSadly, i don't think this relationship will last.", "NTA, but is this behaviour out of character for him? Do you think your brother's change of mind over the name might be a proxy for other worries/doubts he's having? It's possible he's panicking as the birth gets closer because he's worried about being a good parent, and is using the name change as an attempt to have some control over the situation.", "Not being funny but she's the one carrying the baby and delivering it. \n\nSo if she really loves the other name it should be her choice. Why does he get to dictate it?\n\nThat's without the shit show of all you guys buying things and him having the audacity to think he's in the right. \n\nYour brother sounds like a total prick", "Oh man.

And this is when the nurse informed her that this was indeed her Baby New Name, that my dad had just filled out the birth certificate. Mom was so pissed, it was a name they had never even discussed.\n\nFor the record, I HATE my name.

Personally, I'd feel resentment every time I'd see that reminder if I was this situation.", "Better still, say she agrees, and then put the other name on the birth certificate. Depending on where she lives, she may be the only one that needs to sign off on the initial paperwork.", "So many men reveal how deplorable they are when their partner gets pregnant. He\u2019s got her trapped now, he no longer has to pretend to be a decent human being.", "You should legally change your name to the one your mum wanted", "What are your feelings on the name you should have been?", "NTA for all the reasons stated but omg imagine putting your pregnant wife through all this stress, brother is a big time AH and it\u2019s wild to me he isn\u2019t being open with his wife", "NTA\n\nhe acted like a spoiled child.", "NTA I can be petty af so I\u2019d be referring to the baby Only by the original name, and get as many people in on it as possible (bet you can get the expecting mom in on it).", "NTA - that was extremely low of him all around", "NTA. Everyone needs to return everything and not buy gifts. What an AH.", "NTA. I \\*love\\* purchasing personalized and monogrammed clothing & items for babies. If I had purchased something personalized and then the father just decided to change the name, I would give him the clothes, tell him he could use them or not, but I would not be reordering with the new name.", "He is a monster & controlling to boot. I hope your SIL sticks to her guns. Throw the shower & give the gifts.\n\nNTA", "NTA but also, babies can't read and those gifts are useable with the wrong name.  A friend of mine named her daughter X when she was born and then just decided it was wrong and started calling her Y 6 weeks later.  You can revise a birth certificate (where I live at least) for a year after a kid is born free of charge.  All the little girl's baby stuff said X.  It all still worked.  It was weird but fine.  No one re-purchased gifts with the new name.", "NTA\n\nThis is just selfish. He just created an unbelievable amount of stress for everyone all for nothing.", "Just keep the baby shower as it is and give her the names gifts. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m creating a whole new party a week before", "SIL needs to give the kid the name they agreed on, regardless. What her husband did is cruel. She\u2019s the one that is supposed to fill out the birth certificate, she needs to do it the way they planned.", "I know people hate \"gender reveals\" but we did a small one at a family party (it was 5 minutes of an already existing get together) because to us it wasn't about what genitals our baby had, it was what decided their name. I guess it was more of a \"name reveal.\" As soon as we knew we were having a boy we started referring to him by his name. It made him feel more \"real\" talking about him and hearing other talk about him by his name, I loved it. \n\nI can imagine how upset I'd be if suddenly my partner changed his mind, the baby was named and everyone knew the name and called the baby by their name. Their baby may not be here yet but they had a name and it had been officially announced.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely all of this. He\u2019s upset about the consequences of his actions.", "I announced my baby's name at 15 weeks when we found out she was a girl", "\n\n>because the brother was never okay with the name and probably only went with it because the wife liked the name.\n\nthat is no one's problem but his. if he's gonna be a father then he can damn well act like an adult and use his words. instead he wasted everyone's time and money. op is absolutely not the asshole for telling him straight", "Everyone who has already bought things with this name should just give them anyway. This is totally on the brother.\n\nNTA", "I would get all the rest of the family together to agree to stay on SIL's side and pretend brother never changed his mind, pretend the new name was never mentioned. \n\nEven if he weasles his way around to get his preferred name on the birth certificate, never call the baby that name and stick with the name SIL agreed to.\n\nIf he wants new things with the new name, he can buy it himself.", "What style is the name she wants? Modern? Classic?\n\nAnd what is the style he wants?", "I live in PA and my husband wasn\u2019t allowed to fill out the paperwork, it had to be me. I could have named our kids Jellybean and Pancake and he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.", "It\u2019s two yeses, one no.

If you are under and your father wont agree to it just change it when you turn 18. Life is a long time to go with a name you hate.", "I was going to name my son one name. Told everyone that name. NOBODY liked it. So I bowed to peer pressure and named him a more traditional name.  Years go by and now I'm seeing all sorts of kids running around with the name I wanted. It burns me up.", "So, what is stopping you from changing your name legally like Express-Librarian353 said?  The name your father hung on you got you bullied your entire life brought you to harm (being bullied IS being harmed after all). I think you're entitled to change it.   \n\n\nMy mom wanted to name me something else, but my father insisted on me having my mom's (and several maternal grandmothers') first name -- which she didn't want because it was a \"hard-luck name\".  Then he died when I was almost 9. I changed it when I was 25. It's not the name my mom had first picked, but she did approve and agreed it suited me much better.", "The blind-ness reminds me of when I was in military (US) training.\n\nIt was close to a crush I had for 3 years; we hung out on weekends, good things to remember.  \nBut, in a few months, she went back to a boyfriend; someone me and her 3 male friends didn't care for. She was surprised we weren't happy and elated at her getting back with her old ex.", "NTA. As an mom a new baby, I\u2019d just gift the personalized stuff anyways. It\u2019s not like the baby is going to know the difference and the dad should never hear the end of it. If he\u2019d stop being such a defensive dummy it could be a funny story forever.", "NTA. Point out to your brother that everyone can\u2019t all be wrong all the time about the same thing.", "NTA\n\nHe announced the name in advance specifically for the baby shower gifts. \n\nChanging the name now at this later date and not caring about his wife's feelings or the work done by his extended family makes him the AH in every way.", "NTA but brother sure is. Why would you tell people the name then change it one week before the shower. I would still give the personalized gifts I had already bought", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s not a monster for changing his mind, BUT then\u2026\n\n> don't fucking announce it then and let people use it for months. Don't bring up gifts with the name because that makes it feel like an even bigger done deal.\n\nThat is the sum total of the objection. He allowed people to spend time, money and effort on it and he owes everyone an apology for wasting their time, only and effort.", "Also, men have no idea how long it takes to do these types of things. He probably didn't even consider how much time had already been spent.", "Seriously! Whoever's genitals are going to tear open upon delivery of said child should have the final say on the name!", "SIL - Him?  I've never seen him in my life.", "Anyway is a terrible name. I hope she chooses something more conventional", "\ud83d\ude02 This needs more upvotes!", "Family pressure for one. After Mom got over being pissed she accepted it, and tells me I have to just go with it, that changing it would be disrespectful to not only my dad, but to her as well.", "NTA", "NTA I'd still give him the personalized gifts and let him know IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS!", "NTA\n\nWoooo bro sounds exhausting! I envision that SIL might not say with him for longer if he's like this with most things", "NTA. Your brother is a twit. I would be furious, too. His poor wife.", "If I was SILs mom, I would have lost it.", "I'm so sorry for you all.", "Also you could let her know that if they do end up splitting up, you choose her instead of him.", "When my husband disapproved of my name suggestion, we compromised.  I told him if he wanted a say in the last name, I got to pick the first name.", "She should choose Wisely.", "This is has \u201cIs it me or is Veto starting to sound really good?\u201d energy", "I JUST CHOKED ON MY COFFEE LMAO", "I\u2019m just happy that SIL and bubba have you in their lives, OP. And it sounds like your whole circle of peeps is equally supportive in the right places (and vocally frustrated in the right places, too!) \n\nMaybe you could lob a curveball in to the mix and have a family feud style baby name battle with the highest ranking name (that is not going to break SIL\u2019s heart) wins? Even just as a joke, to lighten the mood? \n\nI\u2019m sorry your brother\u2019s being a butthead\u2026 hope he doesn\u2019t \u2018change his mind\u2019 about being a dad the week before his child is born.", "NTA, there is a simple life lesson for your brother to learn, that most people learn much earlier in life, \"when everyone else is an asshole, you're the asshole\".", "He has the right to change his mind however asking for personalized gifts and then changing his mind is a jerk move. NTA. He needs to be called out.", "NTA\n\nThey'd been ***completely fine*** changing the name at any point had he not divulged it and literally asked for customized gifs", "NTA he wanted the attention on him now he has it", "ESH this seems like a really juvenile reason to fight with him. He changed his mind BEFORE the baby came as he and SIL are allowed to do. You could have still given the original gifts and let them deal with the consequences instead of being this upset that he chose a different name for his own child.", "NTA. Holy shit not by a long shot. But your brother sure is. I would be LIVID if this were me. I picked our sons first name, husband picked middle. We told everyone and happily accepted and asked for monogrammed/personalized gifts. Had my husband pulled the stunt your brother pulled, I\u2019d have taken every last dime out of his bank account (not mine!) and paid people back. Your brother sounds insufferable honestly and I hope your SIL is taking note of this asshole behavior. Because wtf.", "I'm a man, and well know how long it takes. Please don't stereotype men like this, it's very sexist.", "He shouldn't get the first one either. She put her body through so much struggle and so many people put so much effort for the baby. He has no right to be a bi*ch. Also he should pay tye price of everything now.", "Take my angry upvote you witty bastard!", "It was two yeses however.  He changed his yes.", "Because it can\u2019t be changed later", "Gosh I miss Friends!", "I'll show you! *Sets name to Changed Later*", "Curses! Foiled again! Next time, Gadget! Next time!", "NTA, although I don't see the use in losing it. He is now stuck with gifts monogramed with that name, whether he likes it or not. That's the gift he gets. SIL can duke it out with him over whether it's the first name or not. I wouldn't care. Here is your gift, do what you want. Never get a custom gift again. Case closed.", "NTA your brother is a big one! i\u2019ve probably neve said this in 20 years at least but i really feel sorry for MIL who took all that time on the blanked!", "NTA. And of course y\u2019all should still give him all the gifts/decorations that have the original name on them. Let the asshole see the effort people went to. But don\u2019t go to any more effort.", "Actions have consequences.\n\nHis insensitivity is over the top. What on earth did he think would happen? Has he always been this clueless about the effects of his actions on others?\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.   \nHis prize is to make amends or be ostracized. He can pick.", "Men? Right. Men.", "That's sexist. Be better.", "What exactly was he thinking?  If he never liked the name why would he do this?  Is there some ulterior motivation to all this?", "Anyweigh", "NTAH. Brother is.", "I\u2019d just use the name like he hadn\u2019t said anything.  It takes a lot of distance to turn around an air craft carrier, and a lot of time to undo something like this.\n\nSo don\u2019t.  NTA.", "He\u2019s literally the asshole, so unfair to make people get used to the name and preparing gifts to randomly change it because he can, not even taking care about what his wife think about it. That\u2019s so messed up and selfish", "NTA\n\nHe didn\u2019t change his mind, he knew he didnt like it and would not be okay with it all along. He lied to her and the family and only came clean just before it would be too late to press a change. \n\nThat he sees literally no issue with his behavior is just icing on the AH cake.", "I\u2019d still give those gifts I already purchased and nothing else. \n\nNTA", "I don't think OP is the ahole anymore. The brother had plenty of chances to change the name and decided to wait until the last minute to inconvenience everyone. He's definitely the ahole and not being fair to his wife, family or child.", "that\u2019s kinda a both ways type of thing", "I'd say he actually is the AH for changing his mind because it sounds likes his wife and he agreed to a name and then he backed out. That makes him an AH in my books.", "Most men I've dealt with really have no clue how long many handicrafts and other more 'feminine' projects take. Show them a handmade quilt and most would guess that it took a few days or weeks and be dumbfounded that it took a year or more to make. I'm sure it's genuine ignorance since most men don't do these types of handicrafts but the problem is many buckle down on their ignorance rather than acknowledge they were wrong/inconsiderate just like OP's brother is doing. Being ignorant isn't the problem, its how they respond thats the problem.", "You're right that lots of men would be ignorant of the time spent on handcrafted quilts or whatnot. But the only women who'd know how long it would take would be women who either have done that themselves or knows someone who has done that themselves and had the thought to ask. I'm sure it varies worldwide but most of the women I know don't have any idea how long a handmade quilt would take either.", "Check with the hospital where baby being born.  When I had my 2 kids it didn't matter what the dad wrote down, the person who shoved the kid out of her body had final say and was the only one allowed to sign.  The birth certificate had to be filled out by me- given to me, witnessed by a nurse and doc.  \n\n No idea what their rules were for surrogates."]}
