My boyfriend was super happy.\n\nNTA OP!", "INFO: I'm just curious, how much ice cream did you put between each layer? Was it just frosting thick, or was it like an inch or two?

Either way, you put a ton of effort into making her something and she just acted like a spoiled brat, then tripled down and CONTINUED acting like you're dumb and that you horribly failed her.

And it sounds like you did a beautiful job.\n\nFor your girlfriend to pick it apart the way she did... virtual head shaking here.  So ungrateful.", "Damn. You were so nice and went above and beyond.

Thank you.\"\n\nMaybe, just maybe, she could have fit it in at some point later that she actually had a different type of cake in mind but it was really incredibly ungrateful and needlessly cruel for her to criticize your 'research' (lol like 'ice cream cake' is an official, formal, and singular description) and not adopt a generally positive response to your very generous gesture. And then the follow up. HILARIOUSLY entitled. You should just purposefully make the wrong thing from here on out for eternity.", "So your love language is baking....but it wasn't your birthday and her love language is \"please get me what I ask for\"\n..it wasn't about you but you made it about you.  It was HER birthday and she had a simple request which you turned into \"all about you\". I love to bake so I didn't buy what she wanted. I was deflated even though it wasn't my birthday and I didn't get the cake I wanted", "NTA - sorry but she's probably the one who doesn't know what an ice cream cake is. A simple google: all have cake in them.", "Keep the cake and ditch the girlfriend.

You put in so much effort and all she did was comolain?\n\nI'm sorry she was a jerk. You deserved a thank you.", "YTA.\n\nMaybe asshole is a bit of a strong word, but it sounds like you made something that was not at all an ice cream cake. Your girlfriend may have been a little harsh but she's absolutely right that a little bit of research would have completely solved this. An ice cream cake is a very specific and ubiquitous type of dessert, and a regular cake that has ice cream on it is not a sufficient substitute at all, especially if someone has asked for it on their birthday. It sounds like an honest mistake, but it was definitely your mistake and it's not out of line for her to feel a little bit let down by it.", "ESH but barely. You didn't do the proper research into it, but put a lot of time and work into a cake for her and that's not something most people would do or know how to, so it was special and most people would appreciate it regardless, and just go buy an ice cream cake after. So I'd say you're barely AH status on that one, and leaning more towards NTA. As for her, I hope she doesn't count on you making her more cakes like that in the future if she keeps brushing them off as just alright and sounding disappointed in what you made her, because if it were me I would stick to store bought for her only at that point going forward. But she also wanted a specific cake and it would have been easy to look it up if you weren't 100% sure. So both are barely AH here.", "Light YTA. You should have asked exactly what she wanted and if she meant it had cake inside or not. All the ice cream cakes I've had did not have a baked cake inside.", "YTA. You didnt make an ice cream cake. There is no cake in it. The bottom is usually a crumble. Like oreo followed by a thin fudgy layer followed by ice cream. What you made is some sort of hybrid. And while i would prob like it.

Yeah you might be a dick to complain when they made an effort! But... That is in fact, not what you had in mind when you asked.\n\nI thought you meant a burger made out of cheese! \n\nNO, I meant a burger with cheese on it!\n\nI thought you meant a cake with ice cream on it!\n\nNO, I meant a cake made out of ice cream!\n\nPeople do tend to get unreasonable about their birthdays. I don't think she was in any way polite or appropriate. But I CAN see why she was frustrated.", "She expected a cake made of ice cream and not a cake with ice cream on top which is what he made. If you asked for a cheeseburger and someone gave you a burger made from cheese you wouldn't be happy. It's a pretty big difference of what she wanted VS what she got.", "Yeah, exactly.", "It's the texture for me! Going in thinking there's a good rich thickness to it and it's airy and far too sugary.", "And that's what I was confused by. I suppose I could have asked her if she wanted the non bake version, but all sources had me thinking cake was involved. She normally likes cake too so I wasn't sure what was entirely wrong but oh well.", "That may depend on where they live because I've always seen them the way OP made it but have never even heard of his gf's version. Even when ordering them from a bakery or ice cream store one has to choose cake flavor, ice cream flavor, and icing flavor.", "I can't see why she's frustrated......it's a cake, she's 30 years old and still complaining weeks later. If she was 7 I would get it", "Did you read the post because that's not what he made. The topping was mint flavored cream. The ice cream was in between each layer of the cake with oreos sprinkled on top. \n\nWhere did you get he made a cake and just threw some ice cream on it?", "It happens...live and learn...now if she keeps bring it up then you both need to talk. It was a nice jesture on your part that quite didn't stick the landing but it happens. I hope she let's it go", "we live in the southern US, specifically GA. Maybe it's a northerner vs southerner thing?", "If the ice cream is the layers then it's on top of each cake layer...... which isn't what she asked for. An ice cream cake does not contain any actual cake.", "I live in the same region, and the way you made it is the \"right\" way, or at least it's the only way I've ever seen them  here.", "I am going to have to step in here and say that google is telling me \"alternate layers of ice cream with cake or with crumbled cookies\"\n\nand the wiki \"An ice cream cake is a cake with ice cream as the filling for a swiss roll or a layer cake. a no-bake version can be made by layering different flavors of ice cream in a loaf pan\"\n\nthis was a question or whether or not i guess i should have asked her to specify exactly what she wanted", "Uh you do know if there's frosting on top the ice cream is in between layers of cake with the cake on top.  \n\nAnd do a quick Google search you will see what OP made is considered an ice cream cake. You know two things can be the same but different.  \n\nLike my favorite cake is red velvet. You can make a red velvet cake with only frosting on top cake in the middle. You can also make ot where there are layers and frosting in between. They're two different cakes....both are red velvet cakes", "NTA, your effort is commendable. \n\nThat said, as someone who has only ever known ice cream cakes as pure ice cream and frosting, I can see where GF might have been thrown off a bit if that was her expectation. \n\nNevertheless, her reaction was pretty rude given the obvious effort you put in.", "I'm pretty sure an ice cream cake has ice cream and cake in it", "What? NTA. \n\nShe's totally wrong. Head to Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone. There's cake in there...\n\nThe only place I've ever personally seen not put cake in is DQ.\n\nThat's unfortunate that she wasn't appreciative after all your hard work.", "My ice cream cake recipe from America's Test Kitchen calls for both cake and ice cream. I also grew up with Baskin Robbins (Home of 31 flavors) and their famed cakes were also ice cream and cake.\n\nI dunno what she's smoking or where she had her \"ice cream cake\" but it wasn't the standard recipe.\n\nNTA\n\nIn future, I would suggest if she is requesting some recipe you've never tried, you have her describe it in full. This is her dropping her communication skills.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend sounds like a spoiled brat.  If she knows you love to bake, she should have sat down with you and googled the cake she wanted so you could get it right, not told you after the fact and dismissed your efforts with her equivalent of 'meh'.  Then trying to guilt you over it for the next week?   Find someone who can both communicate their needs and appreciate your efforts.  She ain't it.", "Talk about an ungrateful woman. You are NTA all. Your gf on the other hand, the biggest AH. I wouldn\u2019t bother baking for her anymore if I were you", "NTA - I'd die if someone made me a cake for my birthday.", "You are my hero! I love that you not only checked wikipedia, but the OED and Food Network! \n\n:) LOL", "Great British Bake-off too!", "Dairy Queen has all ice cream cakes.", "Depends.  Baskin Robbins has cake in theirs, Dairy Queen is all ice-cream with a cookie crumble center.", "To be clear you did make it right! It wasn't what your gf was expecting but thats on her for not being specific enough", "But...but... that's just ice cream", "Mint chocolate chip ice cream cake from Baskin-Robbins was my jaaaaaam! A housemate made a version from scratch for be a couple years ago and I felt so spoiled", "Ice cream cakes are frozen, but the original recipes and the standards involve having layers of cake (or cookies or some other baked good sometimes).", "Agree. OP did listen to her and did try to make what they thought she wanted.", "I bet she wanted a DQ Thin Mint cake.  Let her know those were a limited time oy and no longer available.", "Are they going for zhuzh? (Not trying to be rude!)", "The ice cream I had almost every year as a kid from Baskin-Robbins had layers of cake in it. I didn\u2019t know there were ice cream only ice cream cakes until this thread.", "I live in IL and I've always had the kind you made.  I did see a slice of Dairy Queen ice cream \"cake\" before, but I've never eaten any because I don't eat chocolate and they don't have a version without crushed Oreos."]}
