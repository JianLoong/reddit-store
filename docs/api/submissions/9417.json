And to get his friends to call you... he's how old?", "NTA. Although you really could benefit from learning some discretion. This aside, if your parents have treated you better than your brother, I can see why he would resent that. His problem should not be with you however. So much jealousy can cloud people\u2019s vision.

Misdirected resentment.", "The brother is an asshole but holy shit, I hate people like his girlfriend. Putting their nose on family business is a huge asshole move.", "Pretty sure everyone makes opinions of people based on what they know.

Your brother gets an A+ for being able to write a tall tale with nothing but the truth. \n\nI mean, everything he said was the truth, wasn't it? He didn't lie even once. Not a single time.

Not your fault.", "NTA, Don't start nothing, will be nothing", "NTA\n\nBrother made bad choices and now he's old enough to see where they got him. He's bitter and taking it out on you.

She knows the answer. She has THREE *separate* examples of his response to the question of impending fatherhood. \n\nSure, she might get financial assistance (anything in the trust fund left?), but that might not be what she wants. I would care more about having a partner than having child support. Sure, money is helpful. But the best part about having a partner during (and after) pregnancy was being able to poke him awake at 3 am because I just can't handle anymore diapers. \n\nMoney can't buy me someone I can rely on at 3 am. Well, maybe, but it would have to be a HUGE amount of money.", "That made me chuckle", "Are abortions that expensive that they need to break into a trust fund for? \n\nI would think there\u2019s a rather large price difference between 3 abortions vs college tuition.", "I doubt somebody like that would willingly take responsibility for anything they do/did.", "I believe in my area they were $600.
