During our time together, we have discussed going to visit Japan as it is both of our dream trips. We agreed to both save our own money to be able to go. The problem is he isn't good at saving, and I am, so he's convinced me to keep putting it off and putting it off until he has money to go as well, and I agreed. I was set to go in May of this year, but now he wants to do late fall, so I again agreed. I told him as long as he is able to pay his own plane ticket and food, I will do all the accommodation for both of us. I even got a travel credit card that I racked up enough points to use on and told him I'll give it to him so he only has to pay 200-300 for his ticket instead of $1000 or more. \nIt's been 5 years and I'm tired of waiting and putting off my dream trip. I feel I've done all I can to help other then just buying the whole trip for him at this point. If he isn't ready by this fall I think I might just go without him. Would I be the asshole if I were to go by myself when i know how much he wants to go?\n\nTo be clear I don't make that much money as it is and can't quite afford to pay for everything if I pay for his whole trip as well as mine.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone on your opinions, I've been feeling pretty conflicted over it. I think I'll either end up going by myself or take my mom with me and nothing is stopping me from going back if he ever is able to go in the future so I could always take 2 trips.

Does he need help saving; not everyone learns this skill. Read him your post if you need to. Something(s) is holding him back.

I think you would morally be fine, but idk how this would affect your relationship.

Money issues are one of the biggest reasons for breakups/divorces. What you have shared strongly suggests that you and your boyfriend have very, very different mentalities and/or abilities when it comes to money management. I think that\u2019s something for you two to make sure you can get on and stay on the same page about.\n\nIf I were in your boyfriend\u2019s position and understood what this trip meant for you, I would be thrilled for you to go alone. No loving partner would choose to hold you back from achieving that kind of dream. Whatever my issues with money, there would be no jealousy. Maybe some disappointment, but you have earned this experience!\n\nFwiw, I would find a way to put what you\u2019ve told him in writing. So that if this Fall comes around and he\u2019s still in the same place financially, you can literally point to irrefutable evidence you already told him what would happen. But I\u2019m petty and annoyed on your behalf.", "OP after almost 5 years, and putting it off so many times although you don't mention specifics, I hope that you realize that this is a **red flag** that you can't ignore for potential matrimony.  Yes some of the suggestions of a saver application, you offering to use your cc points to help with his ticket, etc. are great, but in the end he's not doing the work for his equal share of the vacation because you're still footing the bill for the hotels.  Please don't fall into the trap of so many other couples where one partner is the saver and the other can't save much of anything.  Do what you think is best for you in the end, but never not put your needs second to anyone.", "NTA.  Book your tickets for May, tell him if he can afford to go, he can buy his tickets and tag along.", "NTA, but this is tricky.. \n\nI'm in a similar boat, honestly, and I don't know what to do.. I have a salaried job, and I get a month of paid vacation every year. My girlfriend is in the medical field, and makes great money, but she's hourly, and she doesn't get paid vacation.. so for her to go on vacation, she would have to fund her vacation PLUS the lost income, whereas I would just have to fund the vacation.. this makes a two week trip $3,000-$4,000 more expensive for her than it is for me.. so I just don't end up going anywhere, and honestly it sucks.. but also, I don't want to go alone - I want to share it with her.. \n\nSo no, you're not an asshole. Go on the trip if you'd be just as happy going alone. And if you're willing to face the fallout.. but I would recommend opening a free chequing account in your name only, and having your S.O. send you $x per paycheque, which you would deposit into that account.. help him save.. this way, he can't access it, and he can't blow it. You can hold him accountable at every pay, and then you can go together :)", "NTA", "NTA. This has been your dream vacation as well as his.  You have put in the work to make it happen, he hasn't. That is his problem, but going without him may mean your relationship won't survive if he gets mad at you for not waiting for him to have the money, even though he has had the opportunity to save the money, just hasn't done it.", "NTA You are not married and he is not doing his share.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t asking him to save that much. If he isn\u2019t able to do that then that tells you want to expect for the rest of your life.

You've been putting it off for years waiting on him to grow up and save enough money to go and he just keeps stalling and stalling.

Or ask her if this is really problem. If she has no issue with the cost, plan away!", "It would be far better for him to open a Vacation account that he deposits part of each paycheck.  (A savings book).  That way the burden isn't on her (again). \nSmall change but he needs to learn to do this independently.", "Uneven power dynamic like that is the fastest way i can think of to torpedo the relationship short of bedding someone in front of him", "Love the checking acct idea. 'Help him save'; a critical skill in a long-term relationship. This shared opportunity can build excitement reaching a goal or it will shine a light on his inability to work toward goals, engage in delayed gratification, etc.", "This is a really good idea and one I've thought about! I just don't want to come off as controlling I guess but if he thinks it's a good idea we might go that route.", "Selfish? She is practically bending over backwards to make this happen. Could she get more involved in his business to help him learn how to save? Yes, but I don't see her as selfish. He too is responsible for repeatedly not reaching a goal. He can equally step up and say, \"I need help. I'm not good at saving money. Can you we work on this together?\".", "They agreed to save.  She did and he didn't.  How is that her fault?  She isn't his mommy.", "I say unto you: payeth not your friend\u2019s vacation, lest financial calamity befall you!", "A fair assessment but be careful. The longer he fails the goal the more solutions you create like reducing his airfare from 1K to $300. Let him find solutions. He may be thinking, she'll never go w/out me and she's good at figuring things out like making and saving money.", "Tough call. If it were me, I'd go on the trip anyway because life's short. \n\nWhat would be worse for you though:\n\n1. Maybe never go on the trip, or at least not so long as you are together.\n2. Go on your own but learn that this is hurtful to him.\n3. Pay for him to go when you can afford it.\n\nSounds like NAH. More of an issue of what would you find the least problematic of the poor choices.", "Right. Women do so much of the \u201cmanaging\u201d of relationships without this becoming her problem to solve as well", "I hear your worry, but with the strategy relating only to the vacation savings, I think it's unlikely that she becomes a financial gatekeeper.. it's just a matter of \"hey hun, don't forget to send $100 so I can put it in your vacation account!\" \n\nIt's a bit of an extreme, sure, but if he can't save for one trip in 5 years... He might really benefit from leveraging his partner's discipline.. he might decide that it's best if it *does* spill over into other things (down payment for a house, wedding fund, retirement, etc.)", "Agreed! He is old enough to save on his own, she shouldn't have to be his mom about this and this is for something fun it's not even a chore.", "Also, there are apps out there that will SAVE MONEY FOR YOU. He should find one and use it.", "Only risk there, is that he might seem it necessary to \"dip\" into the account, and never end up actually saving..", "You'll come off as controlling, because you will be controlling.  You can't win here, OP.  You will eventually get very tired of shouldering this burden by yourself, and he will resent you for not \"letting\" him spend his money whenever he wants to.\n\nYou aren't compatible.", "I 100% hear you.. but if I understand correctly, his options are: save, or miss out on the trip entirely.. and apparently he can't really save on his own, so it's not as much about controlling him, as it is about helping him get his dream vacation with his life partner :) \n\nI would try a calm, objective, but firm approach.. \"I'd like to talk to you about the vacation. As planned, it will cost $3,500 each (or whatever). This is a dream trip of mine, and I am going in the next 24 months. Money aside, is this still a trip that you would like to enjoy with me? Yes? Ok, there are 52 pay periods in the next two years, and you need to save $3,500 (or whatever). That means that every pay, you need to save $68 towards the vacation. Is that something that you can afford? Great! Here's what I'd like to do: *explain idea*. I know it might make you a little uncomfortable, but I'm not delaying my trip any longer if I don't know for sure that you are actually saving. I would like to go with you, and I'm happy to help you with my travel points, but this is a dream of mine, and I need you to take it seriously.

Nobody claimed he wasn\u2019t responsible, we just conveniently ignore the partnership aspect of a relationship. Or at least OP has. She\u2019s not doing anything to lift him up or help him achieve his goals. \n\nThis is absurd.", "In which case they both learn something valuable.", "He'll agree, and OP will put off the trip *again*, and then he won't follow through.  That's been his pattern for *five years* - OP sacrifices and saves toward their supposedly shared goal, and he spends all of his money on whatever he wants.  He's 32 and is probably pretty set in his ways by now.  OP should just go alone.", "What do you think she should do? \n\nTake control of his accounts? Make him give her money to hold onto and \u201cbe the bad guy\u201d by saying no when he wants to spend it on something?\n\nDo you think OP should parent him? \n\nI just don\u2019t get what more she should be doing here, looking for specific examples", "You're absurd. She's his *partner* not his parent. His saving is his responsibility. She's offered things to help lower his cost and he can't even be bothered to do this. She's told him she'll go without him and he hasn't taken it seriously. Stop putting the responsibility of men's failures on their partners. He's 4 years older, she shouldn't need to teach him to be a grown up.", "You are misplacing who is responsible for the failure. She can be an asset to help him create change but it is up to him. When in a relationship we still have personal responsibility.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for them both to learn about how they are showing up to reach life goal. The boyfriend repeats the same behavior and expects a different outcome; this is called crazy. He needs to change his crazy which can include asking for help.", "Of course it is *her* fault, because she \"let him fail\".  What a load of crap.  It's not her job to dictate to him what to do with his money.  He's 32 years old and he has had five years to learn how to save.  If he has refused to do so, that is on him.", "I literally said what I think she should do. Help him learn to save using the various tactics available and be a partner to help somebody succeed. \n\nY\u2019all are just making things up that never happened right now.", "She\u2019s neither. Y\u2019all are showing your true colors here for sure.", ">you are misplacing \n\nNope.\n\nNice dodge, how is she bending over backwards again?", "She should \u201chelp him\u201d using \u201cvarious tactics\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re right, you\u2019ve clearly over-elaborated.\n\nHelp him learn using various tactics..", "She's offered to pay far more than half of the cost of the trip, so he has to save much less than she does.  You dont't think that is bending over backwards to help him?", "You realize you can google many different ways to help save money and I don\u2019t need to write and essay on that here? Are you serious lol? Go to the envelope vacation game or something. People being intentionally obtuse.", "You do realize *he* can Google how to save money and it\u2019s not his girlfriend\u2019s responsibility? \n\nYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s so sure she\u2019s not doing enough, doesn\u2019t sound like you know what you\u2019re talking about.", "Again, your basis is the idea that relationships aren\u2019t partnerships where you should be helping each other strengthen yourselves.\n\nWeird take but ok.", "-We agreed to both save our own money to be able to go. \n\n-he's convinced me to keep putting it off and putting it off until he has money to go as well, and I agreed.

The typhoon season has passed by then. Also ShichiGoSan is in November. 7 and 3-year-old girls, and 5-year-old boys dress up in kimonos and visit the shrines. Really cute.\n\nMay can be a little hot and depending on the year, the rainy season (very humid) may start early. Also avoid Golden Week - April 29th to May 5th.
