It would involve quitting all my after school stuff and not hanging out with friends after school either. They also want me to stay home next summer and to consider hanging around to be there for the next few summers. I was like no way.

I told them THEY had responsibilities as parents and I am not a parent, I am the child in their house. They told me not for long.

After I heard them talk with each other I found out I could graduate in December by talking to my guidance counselor.

Do Not let them missuse you. And congrats to your good Grades, Well done!!!", "NTA. At all. They want you to be a live in nanny and raise their child that they don't want.", "The classic \u201cyou\u2019re selfish for not giving up your life whilst I live my best life\u201d attitude. \nHave you got grandparents or other family you could go stay with?", "NTA. Yes, family members have responsibilities toward each other, but what they expect of you without making their own efforts first is ridiculous.", "NTA. You are still a teenager and it's unfair for your parents to expect you to take on such a significant responsibility. It's not your job to be the primary caregiver for your sibling. While it's normal for older siblings to occasionally help out with younger ones, your parents' expectations go beyond that. It's important for you to focus on your own life, education, and future. Your parents need to find another solution for childcare that doesn't involve sacrificing your own personal development and goals.", "NTA, they cannot expect you to be a parent to your sibling. If they want they can pay you to babysit and even then you still can say no. You have no obligation to become a parent to your sibling.", "Absolutely NTA. So good of you to stand up for yourself! It's their baby and their responsibility. They are trying to gaslight you to have free childcare, they are the selfish ones.", "NTA continue to say no to child care. Tell them you want this child even less than they do.... Tell them adoption is always an option.... That childcare is their job not yours. Then go out and get ANY job you can find and start saving your 'run' money. Good luck kiddo, you've got a good head on your shoulders. You will be alright!", "They are trying to parentify you-NTA", ">They told me I am being incredibly selfish and to think about what I am throwing away.\n\nNothing. You're throwing away nothing. They want you to quit all your activities and friends so it's not like staying longer benefits you in any way. \n\n>They also want me to stay home next summer and to consider hanging around to be there for the next few summers.\n\nHa. Sure thing. Good job telling them no. You should get out ASAP. NTA.", "NTA. They were barely a parent to you and now they expect you to do their job?! Like babysitting a younger sibling once or twice from time to time is ok, but this?! What were they thinking?!", "NTA Your parents are. They're also the selfish ones. This is their child not yours. Stand your ground. They need to figure out another form of child care and let you have your life.", "Your parents are right. You will miss out on a lot. \n\nChanging diapers, tantrums, running around after a hyperactive toddler among them. \n\nNTA, and you honestly sound way more mature than your parents. Please go as far away as possible from them as soon as you can.", "NTA and that is a ridiculous amount of time daily. They are parents. Time to figure their own shit out.", "NTA and good for you. Do you have any extended family who you could live with even if its in a different part of the country? Any friends whose parents would let you live with them a short while whilst you save up.\n\nLegally in your country can you leave home at 17? UK for example you can leave at age 16 without your parents consent and without police getting involved. Can  your school counsellor help you get in touch with charities or organisations that can help you find accommodation and financial support? If you leave and get a student loan for university - would you get the full amount or would they say your parents earn too much even if you dont live with them.  In the UK i think they'd still base it on your parents salary even if you've moved out. Find out what you need to do to to be able to get full student loans and financial support without your parents income being taken into account.\n\nYou parents are selfish - one of them needs to take time off if they dont want to pay for childcare, they need to downsize, or they need to give the child up for adoption if they want to keep the pregnancy.\n\nIf you have nothing to lose and they care about what their friends, community, colleagues think - put what they are doing on full blast to embarrass them and get them not to force you into this child care role.", "NTA. They don't get to have a baby and have their existing child take care of it. I mean I'm sure you would be OK with occasional babysitting, an evening here and there but what they're asking is plain unreasonable and selfish.", "NTA. Your parents are so wrong at so many levels. \n\nWhat they expect you to do is a form of parental neglect and abuse. You can read more about parentification trauma online.", "NTA\n\nMy mom has always been a single mom, and much like yours very emotionally absent.  when i was 6, she went to a sperm donor just because she wanted another kid. she had twins, and i got that same \"big sister responsibilities talk\"\n\nlong story short i lost my entire childhood to helping raise my siblings. I'm 20 now, the damage done to all of us is irreversible. all that being said, you're absolutely right. That baby is THEIR responsibility and you are entitled to your entire childhood.", "NTA. They are the selfish ones and they are trying to parentify you. Get out as soon as you can. You have a right to live your own life.", "YTA 3hrs is not much considering the baby will need care for the other 21 hrs a day. Your parents aren't asking you to drop out and be a full time care taker.", "Tell them that if you wanted a baby at 16, you would have gotten pregnant yourself  - and that's still an option.  Watch their reaction.", "NTA.   \nBut don\u2019t pick up your parents bad habits in regards to not being there for your young sibling. You can be a loving big sister without being de-facto mother.", "NTA\n\nYou were right when you said: \"THEY had responsibilities as parents and I am not a parent, I am the child in their house.\" (Sorry don't know how to link it from your text).\n\nTHEY are the parents, it is THEIR child and THEIR responsibility. I get helping out once in a while but this is unfair to you. Plus you are 16! You are so young. What happens if you to go to college or something? They are irresponsible parents.", "Yep. That's how it feels to me. They can't be any clearer that they really don't want this baby. I often suspected they were like that with me. So maybe it's time to consider adoption since they clearly don't want to be parents to their kids.", "Nope, no other family I can stay with. I just have them and I don't even really have them.", "Honestly, they should probably look at the options they have available to them also. Sometimes I feel like they would have been happier overall if they had placed me for adoption when I was younger. Maybe that would be something to do now for this baby. Neither wants to take care of the baby, neither wants to pay the money for someone else to do it, they already resent the idea of having to do either option. It's not the baby's fault any more than it was mine when I was born.", "I don't have extended family. Never met anyone in either family. I have never even heard anything about family from them. Not that they spent enough time around me to say anything.\n\nTechnically you have to be 18 unless you can get emancipated (which I don't meet the criteria for in my state) or if you have a close family member. I'm not close enough with any of my friends parents for them to be willing to take me either which could work if my parents wouldn't fight against me leaving.", "I'm sorry. I will never understand people who don't want to be around their kids wanting to have kids or not stopping themselves from having kids. It doesn't do anyone any good.", "It's not her baby. It is the responsibility of the parents. They apparently have done nothing to prevent pregnancy when it is clear that they do not want a baby. OP has the right to complete her education and to build the life she wants.", "That is a lot when I have school and a life. And when it means giving up my summers too.", "They expect me to stay local for college and maybe stay living with them so I can take care of the baby.", "Depending on the law where you live, if they insist on leaving the child with you, it may not be legal as well. At which point you can call your local child services.\n\nI really hope it doesn't get that far, but my impression is that it will.", "School comes first right now, and that includes all extracurricular activities even the non academic ones. Parents are going to have to find another solution.", "I am so sorry you feel like this OP. Are there any other family members you can reach out for support?", "That\u2019s until they decide that you need to put off college until the baby is older", "That is completely unfair on you. They are expecting you to put your life on hold because they aren't responsible enough tonnage another child. Is there another family member you can speak to?", "I do not have other family members, no.", "That would likely happen too. Or they'd tell me to do it online so I can be home all day with the baby."]}
