They want you to be a live in nanny and raise their child that they don't want.", "The classic \u201cyou\u2019re selfish for not giving up your life whilst I live my best life\u201d attitude. \nHave you got grandparents or other family you could go stay with?", "NTA. Yes, family members have responsibilities toward each other, but what they expect of you without making their own efforts first is ridiculous.", "NTA. You are still a teenager and it's unfair for your parents to expect you to take on such a significant responsibility. It's not your job to be the primary caregiver for your sibling. While it's normal for older siblings to occasionally help out with younger ones, your parents' expectations go beyond that. It's important for you to focus on your own life, education, and future. Your parents need to find another solution for childcare that doesn't involve sacrificing your own personal development and goals.", "NTA, they cannot expect you to be a parent to your sibling. If they want they can pay you to babysit and even then you still can say no. You have no obligation to become a parent to your sibling.", "Absolutely NTA. So good of you to stand up for yourself! It's their baby and their responsibility. They are trying to gaslight you to have free childcare, they are the selfish ones.", "NTA continue to say no to child care. Tell them you want this child even less than they do.... Tell them adoption is always an option.... That childcare is their job not yours. Then go out and get ANY job you can find and start saving your 'run' money. Good luck kiddo, you've got a good head on your shoulders. You will be alright!", "They are trying to parentify you-NTA", ">They told me I am being incredibly selfish and to think about what I am throwing away.\n\nNothing. You're throwing away nothing.

Sure thing. Good job telling them no. You should get out ASAP. NTA.", "NTA. They were barely a parent to you and now they expect you to do their job?! Like babysitting a younger sibling once or twice from time to time is ok, but this?! What were they thinking?!", "NTA Your parents are. They're also the selfish ones. This is their child not yours. Stand your ground. They need to figure out another form of child care and let you have your life.", "Your parents are right.

UK for example you can leave at age 16 without your parents consent and without police getting involved. Can  your school counsellor help you get in touch with charities or organisations that can help you find accommodation and financial support? If you leave and get a student loan for university - would you get the full amount or would they say your parents earn too much even if you dont live with them.  In the UK i think they'd still base it on your parents salary even if you've moved out. Find out what you need to do to to be able to get full student loans and financial support without your parents income being taken into account.\n\nYou parents are selfish - one of them needs to take time off if they dont want to pay for childcare, they need to downsize, or they need to give the child up for adoption if they want to keep the pregnancy.\n\nIf you have nothing to lose and they care about what their friends, community, colleagues think - put what they are doing on full blast to embarrass them and get them not to force you into this child care role.", "NTA.

I get helping out once in a while but this is unfair to you. Plus you are 16! You are so young. What happens if you to go to college or something? They are irresponsible parents.", "Yep. That's how it feels to me. They can't be any clearer that they really don't want this baby. I often suspected they were like that with me.

I just have them and I don't even really have them.", "Honestly, they should probably look at the options they have available to them also. Sometimes I feel like they would have been happier overall if they had placed me for adoption when I was younger. Maybe that would be something to do now for this baby.

Absolutely not. The fucking audacity to lecture you about your \u201cresponsibilities\u201d as a sibling while they completely neglect to take responsibility as PARENTS is infuriating. It is unacceptable for them to place the burden of a child they don\u2019t want on you. If they are not interested in being parents then they should consider adoption or terminating the pregnancy. Or simply buck up and take responsibility for their child. You were right to stand up for yourself and set boundaries with your parents over this. It can be hard to do so when you\u2019re still dependent on them which I have a feeling your parents are the type to take advantage of.

You may have to wake up before they do and leave the house. You may have to stay busy until late with school activities. They cannot leave the baby with you if you are not home. Always leave a note stating you went to school and will be back late. They will figure it out without you being the solution. NTA", "Good for you for standing your ground. It's your parents who are being selfish. NTA", "NTA.

Good job.", "NTA at all. Good for you for standing up for yourself! That is really hard to do.\n\nI think you should consider that this -sadly- may be forced on you via the financial leverage parents have over their children. Make sure to think about the cost to you of moving out, of your parents not supporting you after high school. Keep pushing for not doing any sibling care, but if you reach a point where the consequences of no care for your sibling are greater than doing some, make sure to bargain with your parents. Demand something you really want (money, expensive college, whatever), and make that a condition of caring for your sibling. I do not think what they are asking is fair or right at all, but if you end up in a hard place, don\u2019t blow up your life.", "NTA and the level of manipulation they're trying to use on you is staggering. Every time they hit you with a dig, shoot it right back at them, either for you or your sibling. \"think of all you're going to miss by pawning parenting off on me\" \"think of all the life experiences and life advancement I would be missing out on by being forced to babysit for you\"\n\nYou could calculate childcare costs for the time they want you to do, give them a 10% family discount to ensure you'll have the lowest rates in the area, and present it as the only option complete with a W2 and tax payments to the government. Even though it isn't an option for you, it would be really fun to see their lil heads explode", "NTA they\u2019re telling you how bad it\u2019s going to be to miss out while refusing to take off any real amount of time therefore missing out on what they\u2019re telling you you\u2019ll miss out on. They\u2019re also not giving af that you we\u2019re responsible enough not to get pregnant in high school but they\u2019re going to put the the same responsibilities that you\u2019d have if you did and I\u2019m not sure how this wouldn\u2019t be looked at as almost a punishment. Then the last part of the post about not being a good sister if you refuse to be part of her life sounds like a threat whereas this is the only choice they\u2019re giving you on how to be part of her life. \n\nYour parents are the asshole though for sure. Given the prospect of chasing their daughter out of the house and away from the family they doubled down with only concerns for themselves and have the nerves to call anyone selfish.\n\nEdit: Also zero mention of financial compensation and the giving up on after school activities.

OPs parents are (at the very least...) being openly explicit about their intentions to parentify OP in advance. \n\nBased on their post it seems OP can indeed see the likely trajectory here; and intends to use their own initiative to make plans to remove themself from the situation before they are gradually indoctrinated into the parent role. This is completely understandable.\n\nI'm sorry for the situation you are in OP, and it also sounds like you're an intelligent and insightful young person who knows your mind. Definitely NTA btw.\n\nEdited to add: upholding appropriate boundaries with your parents about your role in your siblings life does not mean that you cannot still be a supportive and caring sibling, but the role is sibling - not parent.", "I doubt it. My whole life I have wondered if they ever wanted to be parents really. I don't see that changing now.", "Ordinarily I might agree with you but in this case, I'm afraid taking on any care/responsibility would quickly snowball into babysitting all the time. It sounds like OP plans to go NC as soon as she is able which would make it almost impossible to maintain a loving big sister relationship.", "So she has to leave school and directly come home and not do activities , get help from a teacher , have an after school job etc etc. How is she supposed to do homework with a baby?

That is 100% reasonable, you are still legally a child yourself and they are trying to make you accountable for their decisions.\n\nI hope you have other family that you might be able to rely upon to aid you with support once you graduate?\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m sorry. That is not how it should be and it\u2019s not fair on your and your nearly sibling. \n\nI hope you can find your \u2018family\u2019. Sometimes its friends or relatives or a neighbour or workmate.

You would think if there are such career minded people they would be ballin' or do they just like working for the sake of working?", "Unfortunately I think you need to start preparing to do what you said and move out.\n\nThere's almost zero chance they just go along with what you said. First, it'll be \"just watch your sister this ONE day, it's an emergency.\" Then \"just watch your sister for 1 day a week.\" Then \"You're already doing it, so just watch her every day.\" If you disagree, they'll just find a way to \"ground\" you and cancel your activities so you have no choice. \n\nI think you need to start making your plans and if they actually don't do this, consider it a bonus.

I never would have dreamt of making the OPs parents assumptions about her involvement though.

I\u2019m not good with babies, either, and found it uncomfortable to change the diaper of someone else\u2019s child, albeit my brother. Taking care of a child is a hugeeee responsibility, and as a child yourself, you shouldn\u2019t be expected to handle that, especially if you are telling them no.

It sounds like they resent this baby for existing and with the way they\u2019ve treated OP, like they resent that she exists too on some levels. Childcare is a lot of money, parents who actually like and want their children might complain about the cost or struggle with the cost, but ultimately want the best care possible for their kids.
