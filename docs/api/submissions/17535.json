They want you to be a live in nanny and raise their child that they don't want.", "The classic \u201cyou\u2019re selfish for not giving up your life whilst I live my best life\u201d attitude. \nHave you got grandparents or other family you could go stay with?", "NTA. Yes, family members have responsibilities toward each other, but what they expect of you without making their own efforts first is ridiculous.", "NTA. You are still a teenager and it's unfair for your parents to expect you to take on such a significant responsibility. It's not your job to be the primary caregiver for your sibling. While it's normal for older siblings to occasionally help out with younger ones, your parents' expectations go beyond that. It's important for you to focus on your own life, education, and future. Your parents need to find another solution for childcare that doesn't involve sacrificing your own personal development and goals.", "NTA, they cannot expect you to be a parent to your sibling. If they want they can pay you to babysit and even then you still can say no. You have no obligation to become a parent to your sibling.", "Absolutely NTA. So good of you to stand up for yourself! It's their baby and their responsibility. They are trying to gaslight you to have free childcare, they are the selfish ones.", "NTA continue to say no to child care. Tell them you want this child even less than they do.... Tell them adoption is always an option.... That childcare is their job not yours. Then go out and get ANY job you can find and start saving your 'run' money. Good luck kiddo, you've got a good head on your shoulders. You will be alright!", "They are trying to parentify you-NTA", ">They told me I am being incredibly selfish and to think about what I am throwing away.\n\nNothing. You're throwing away nothing.

Sure thing. Good job telling them no. You should get out ASAP. NTA.", "NTA. They were barely a parent to you and now they expect you to do their job?! Like babysitting a younger sibling once or twice from time to time is ok, but this?! What were they thinking?!", "NTA Your parents are. They're also the selfish ones. This is their child not yours. Stand your ground. They need to figure out another form of child care and let you have your life.", "Your parents are right. You will miss out on a lot. \n\nChanging diapers, tantrums, running around after a hyperactive toddler among them. \n\nNTA, and you honestly sound way more mature than your parents.

Do you have any extended family who you could live with even if its in a different part of the country?

UK for example you can leave at age 16 without your parents consent and without police getting involved. Can  your school counsellor help you get in touch with charities or organisations that can help you find accommodation and financial support? If you leave and get a student loan for university - would you get the full amount or would they say your parents earn too much even if you dont live with them.  In the UK i think they'd still base it on your parents salary even if you've moved out. Find out what you need to do to to be able to get full student loans and financial support without your parents income being taken into account.\n\nYou parents are selfish - one of them needs to take time off if they dont want to pay for childcare, they need to downsize, or they need to give the child up for adoption if they want to keep the pregnancy.\n\nIf you have nothing to lose and they care about what their friends, community, colleagues think - put what they are doing on full blast to embarrass them and get them not to force you into this child care role.", "NTA.

I get helping out once in a while but this is unfair to you. Plus you are 16! You are so young. What happens if you to go to college or something? They are irresponsible parents.", "Yep. That's how it feels to me. They can't be any clearer that they really don't want this baby. I often suspected they were like that with me. So maybe it's time to consider adoption since they clearly don't want to be parents to their kids.", "Nope, no other family I can stay with. I just have them and I don't even really have them.", "Honestly, they should probably look at the options they have available to them also. Sometimes I feel like they would have been happier overall if they had placed me for adoption when I was younger. Maybe that would be something to do now for this baby. Neither wants to take care of the baby, neither wants to pay the money for someone else to do it, they already resent the idea of having to do either option.

Are there any other family members you can reach out for support?", "That\u2019s until they decide that you need to put off college until the baby is older", "That is completely unfair on you.

It can be hard to do so when you\u2019re still dependent on them which I have a feeling your parents are the type to take advantage of.
