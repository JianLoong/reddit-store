They want you to be a live in nanny and raise their child that they don't want.", "The classic \u201cyou\u2019re selfish for not giving up your life whilst I live my best life\u201d attitude. \nHave you got grandparents or other family you could go stay with?", "NTA. Yes, family members have responsibilities toward each other, but what they expect of you without making their own efforts first is ridiculous.", "NTA. You are still a teenager and it's unfair for your parents to expect you to take on such a significant responsibility. It's not your job to be the primary caregiver for your sibling. While it's normal for older siblings to occasionally help out with younger ones, your parents' expectations go beyond that. It's important for you to focus on your own life, education, and future. Your parents need to find another solution for childcare that doesn't involve sacrificing your own personal development and goals.", "NTA, they cannot expect you to be a parent to your sibling. If they want they can pay you to babysit and even then you still can say no. You have no obligation to become a parent to your sibling.", "Absolutely NTA. So good of you to stand up for yourself! It's their baby and their responsibility. They are trying to gaslight you to have free childcare, they are the selfish ones.", "NTA continue to say no to child care. Tell them you want this child even less than they do.... Tell them adoption is always an option.... That childcare is their job not yours. Then go out and get ANY job you can find and start saving your 'run' money. Good luck kiddo, you've got a good head on your shoulders. You will be alright!", "They are trying to parentify you-NTA", ">They told me I am being incredibly selfish and to think about what I am throwing away.\n\nNothing. You're throwing away nothing.

Sure thing. Good job telling them no. You should get out ASAP. NTA.", "NTA. They were barely a parent to you and now they expect you to do their job?! Like babysitting a younger sibling once or twice from time to time is ok, but this?! What were they thinking?!", "NTA Your parents are. They're also the selfish ones. This is their child not yours. Stand your ground. They need to figure out another form of child care and let you have your life.", "Your parents are right.

UK for example you can leave at age 16 without your parents consent and without police getting involved. Can  your school counsellor help you get in touch with charities or organisations that can help you find accommodation and financial support? If you leave and get a student loan for university - would you get the full amount or would they say your parents earn too much even if you dont live with them.  In the UK i think they'd still base it on your parents salary even if you've moved out. Find out what you need to do to to be able to get full student loans and financial support without your parents income being taken into account.\n\nYou parents are selfish - one of them needs to take time off if they dont want to pay for childcare, they need to downsize, or they need to give the child up for adoption if they want to keep the pregnancy.\n\nIf you have nothing to lose and they care about what their friends, community, colleagues think - put what they are doing on full blast to embarrass them and get them not to force you into this child care role.", "NTA.

I get helping out once in a while but this is unfair to you. Plus you are 16! You are so young. What happens if you to go to college or something? They are irresponsible parents.", "Yep. That's how it feels to me. They can't be any clearer that they really don't want this baby. I often suspected they were like that with me. So maybe it's time to consider adoption since they clearly don't want to be parents to their kids.", "Nope, no other family I can stay with. I just have them and I don't even really have them.", "Honestly, they should probably look at the options they have available to them also. Sometimes I feel like they would have been happier overall if they had placed me for adoption when I was younger. Maybe that would be something to do now for this baby.

My husband coddles our girls. He wants to protect them and I tell him I want to teach them how to protect themselves because we won't live forever. He and I are very strong and driven people so dealing with this is a challenge for us. He has been coming around to that mentality of empowering over the last year which has been a huge help. Our daughter tends to throw our grandson under the bus the way a sibling would. He used something off my husband's and didn't put it back. It was nearly broken because of where it was left and when I said who left this out her response was Adam! Like a sister would say to her brother in trouble. I usually prefer to address issues in private but at that point I looked at her and said you are the adult, you are ultimately responsible for everything he does and doesn't do so why are you saying Adam when this is actually on you. She got up in a huff and went to her room. Emotionally, she is still in the teenager phase. She was basically held hostage for years by an abusive boyfriend while my husband and I were stationed overseas. They lied and kept it from us because they got their drugs from him. As soon as we found out we grabbed her and gave her an opportunity for a new life but she has never gotten care for the mental effects of that trauma. She runs from conflict. She literally can't handle it. It's a continuous battle to drop wisdom in bite sized pieces for her. I love her as if she were from my womb. I cherish her and how beautiful and giving her heart is. We will still have our grandson nearly every day due to her with schedule and when daycare closes so she will be on her own but in a supported way. Our grandson is very honest with me and we have an agreement that he can tell me anything and it will remain between us. He tells me when she tells him to lie about things she knows we have told her not to do or that aren't good for her/him. He is very loyal to us so being told to lie to us puts him in a terrible position. Just being able to tell me the truth eases that load. These are very much things she learned from her Mom. The emotional incest, the lies like she is a child hiding from mom and dad, and the only showing up for the fun part of parenting. That's all her mom.\n\nEdit: spelling errors", "It depends.

Almost like dealing with a toddler who does something naughty, you have to address it immediately so it's fresh in the mind and connected to the action. Perhaps you could tell her ahead of time that you've discussed her behavior with her before and going forward you are not going to allow her to claim this praise or act like a child herself. Then she can't come back and say  \"NLGsy is picking on me/being mean\".

I don't know if she is the type to want quick rewards/return with little effort but then I'm not sure how she values her rewards/return. Does a hug/thank you from her son make her effort worth while or does she expect something more like winning an award or getting first place? I used to have high expectations for my kids but then kept getting stressed over how I could help my kids 'improve' so I just decided I'd rather they make an effort and let the results play out on its own.

A worthwhile one but still difficult. I really appreciate the input. \n\nShe will play victim but that's what she does. She trashes me to her mom and brothers when she visits but then depends heavily on me when she is here. I know she thinks she has to do this to be accepted by them. They are very much those kind of people. I don't care if she vents about me because I am a strong personality and that's hard to live with. That is fine but lying about me isn't. I know she does love me and considers me more of a mother to her than her mom. She is desperate to be accepted and has deep seeded insecurity. She is ripe for manipulation which is often the case at work. They flatter her and make her feel special then ask her to work all these extra shifts which she does. Like I said, it's an ongoing battle. She is worth it and I hope in time we can get through to her. I also hope we can find a good therapist for her.", "Yes, any kind of positive feedback she eats up. She is great at her job and people love her. She has a beautiful heart and is full of kindness for others. Our grandson walks her to her car when she goes to work. He does this in his own, has been doing it for years. She eats it up. The thing is, she is lonely. She gets that warm and fuzzy from his actions that she should be getting from an adult pursuer. It's a huge red flag for me. Her mom has serious emotional incest with her older brother and she very much models her moms behavior with our grandson. I encourage him to be independent versus highly codependent like she is. She still has him sleeping in her bed. I had him sleeping in his bed years ago but she kept telling him to come lay with her because she is lonely. Believe me, I see the reality of what's before me. Our grandson is more receptive to input so I encourage him to play with friends versus laying in bed with her watching TV. I have him workout with me since he is very overweight because she over feeds him with no activity to offset. I take every teachable moment I have with him. I can only do so much with her.
