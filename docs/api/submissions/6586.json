You are using a very sensitive issue repeatedly as a threat to get her to do what you want. Yes, you are awful for that.", "YTA.  You are bullying your little sister, who probably already feels so much embarassment and humiliation at the situation.  What kind of a brother are you?  That's disgusting.  And all because she wanted to watch a tv show.  Also, your parents are assholes too for not talking to her doctor about why she is still wetting the bed at 11 years old.", "If you had a medical condition that made you shit your pants on a regular basis, making you feel horribly embarrassed every time that happened (and forcing you to have to wear diapers), how would you feel if your parents threatened to tell all your friends about it every time you annoyed them? Imagine what it would feel like to envision your classmates' reactions if your parents showed up to school, stood at the front of the class, and let everyone know the details about this humiliating thing that you can't control. \n\nThat might give you an idea as to how she felt every time you threatened her with that kind of public embarrassment and shame.\n\nYTA for manipulating and blackmailing an **11-year-old child**. I get that you're only 15 and your own mental processes are still developing (including understanding the consequences of your actions), but you're old enough to know that this kind of behaviour is absolutely wrong. Never mind \"bullying\": this is well into \"*wtf is wrong with you*?\" territory. \n\nApologise to her, and to your parents, and see what you can do to make this up to her. Know that she's never going to forget how you've treated her, and you may have seriously damaged your relationship with her permanently because of this.", "YTA. Talk about hitting below the belt....", "YTA. Bed wetting is a medical condition and some people like your sister can't help it. You are being incredibly rude and cruel to her.", "YTA. Let me repeat... YOU ARE THE AH **BULLY**. You are manipulating your little sister and preying on her weaknesses. Your parents have every right to be mad at you and in my opinion, two weeks without streaming is not enough of a punishment. I'm disappointed in you and you're not even my kid.", "YTA\n\nShe was being a normal little kid and you preyed on her fears and insecurities to get her to stop bugging you.", "Siblings can be annoying. Friends can be annoying. But you never, under any circumstance, use sensitive information that you have on one that puts them in an extremely vulnerable, embarrassing and uncomfortable position, to coerce/threaten/blackmail/insult/get back at them. It's that simple.  \n\n\nStop being your sister's bully. Try being her brother instead. YTA.", "YTA yeah. It is not cool to Blackmail an 11-year-old with shaming her ya jerk.", "YTA \nI wet the bed till I was 12. The embarrassment and shame is debilitating. I don't care now and I openly talk about it, but when I was a kid that was the worst thing. I actually spent the night at a friend's house and peed in her bed and I was mortified. I promise you that having someone that she loves and looks up to so much threaten such an intimate thing is One of the worst pains that her 11-year-old heart can handle right now. It's pretty bad. I would definitely have a conversation with your sister and let her know that you're sorry for doing it and you only did it because it was effective to make her leave you alone. Have a conversation, let her know that you still love her, but sometimes you do need your space and peace.", "YTA, \n\nDef below the belt with that one. quite litterally. As a parent I would be pissed at you too. Holding an uncontrollable but embarrasing problem over her head is just plain cruel. I am glad you wouldnt actually tell people but you are just pushing away your sister while making her feel worse about herself. \n\nI get that having a younger sibling can feel annoying at times but as someone who's sibling hasnt talked to them in years, you should do things together while you can. If she couldnt watch that show you should have put something on to watch together.", "YTA\n\nIt's a physical/mental issue. It's not like she can help it. You really couldn't punch much lower unless you went outside and stole an ice cream cone from a toddler.", "YTA, look I get it, siblings are annoying as hell sometimes. That doesn't mean you can threaten to tell her friends about an embarrassing condition (?dont know if this is the right word for it) she has. Overall a low blow, and I would suggest you sincerely apologize to her for it and not threaten it again.", "YTA\n\nThere are things you just don't make fun of.

Jerk move at best", "YTA  put yourself in her shoes   would you want all your friends to know that if it was you who had the issue.  something like that will give bullies endless ammunition against her   you are her older brother  try being one and looking out for her not trying to make her feel horrible", "Yes YTA\n\nYou said yourself: \"shes very sensitive and I dont tease her usually\", which means two things. One, you are fully aware that this has an impact on and two, you still do it anyways. Doesn't matter if you usually don't, you still have. This is a silver bullet and you're flaunting it around holding it over her head for something so trivial. Even just threatening to do it is enough to leave an emotional scar.\n\nI can kinda understand your hesitation with that particular show, but there's better ways to handle it. Frankly you know that certain words and actions can have an affect on people, but you don't understand just what sort of scars it can leave behind. This isn't trivial, it's the kind of thing that can be carried with her forever, so you'd better be damn careful when you come across a silver bullet like that.", "YTA. That's absolutely a shitty thing to do. Your sister cannot help her situation and you holding that over her head is NOT okay.", "YTA- You found a weakness and exploited it.", "Yes YTA. I have a younger sibling and they can be very annoying, I get you there. But threatening her over something so clearly sensitive and personal is definitely going over the line.  You aren't the worst AH in the world, especially since you are also still young, but using this vulnerability she has as a weapon to get her to listen to you is not good at all. If I was you, I would apologize to her and wait out your punishment before trying to talk with your parents about better ways that you can engage with your sister when she is annoying you.", "YTA - she\u2019s 11, younger siblings are annoying a lot, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to be mean to get her to stop bothering you.

That's your sister, she's supposed to be your ride or die and you're making fun of her for something she can't control? Dude. \n\nWhen I was 11 and my older bro was 16, he made fun of when I missed a patch of hair while shaving. He did it ONCE and I still think of it. \n\nApoligize to your sister and your parents, for real.", "YTA\n\nYou regularly threaten a child with public humiliation over a medical condition?\n\nIt really seems like you didn't come here because you just, gee, really don't know if maybe you're TA.

Your sister has a legitimate medical issue and you decide to use that against her as blackmail material. \nGrow up", "YTA - You're her big brother.  How would you feel if you were in her shoes and she threatened you like you are her.  Come on, dude.  You have to do better.  She's 11.  Of course she's going to be annoying.  Guess what, when you were that age you were annoying to someone as well.  This is the one thing that you need to help and support her on.  Not bully and manipulate her.  Please do better with your sister.", "boohoo, how could your little sister commit such a heinous crime as being a little annoying and wanting to be included with what youre doing? yeah it was 100% justified for you to keep holding that over her head, anyone could see she was asking for it. YTA, get over yourself.", "YTA-but not the biggest in the world. You\u2019re 15 and you need to think through your words and actions more. Bed wetting late is common with many different things (I bed wet late-as a child they assumed it was just because I am a heavy sleeper, but as an adult we think it was from ADHD). You knew you never intended to tell anyone, but to your sister, that is probably one of her biggest fears. And she can\u2019t read your mind. \n\nHere is a good way to know if something is bullying or  teasing. Don\u2019t punch down-if it will embarrass someone if it gets out, it\u2019s bullying. If it\u2019s a funny trait or story that someone might laugh at or even tell themselves, it\u2019s teasing. Some people don\u2019t even like teasing (I\u2019m one of those people-but that\u2019s because family members punched down and called it teasing, when it was really just destroying my trust in them). You don\u2019t need to put up with your sister being a brat, and if she doesn\u2019t listen your parents need to deal with that. \n\nI think if you sit down with your sister and let her know you never intend to embarrass her, ever, as you are her brother first and want her to be happy, it would be a good thing. But she also needs to listen to you when you say no, and talk with your parents about how they would want you to handle similar situations in the future. If she isn\u2019t listening to you, they need to intervene and let her accept a healthy boundary-no 11 year old should be watching Dexter.\n\nMaybe compromise and watch things she can\u2019t see when she\u2019s asleep or otherwise engaged. Or talk with your parents about you being able to lock your door if you want to watch something she can\u2019t see during the day.", "YTA. Even if the age gap is not huge, around yours and your sisters age there are a looot of changes going on, she's basically still a child while you're supposed to start behaving like a young adult.\n\nI hope she's followed by a good doctor.\nAnd I hope you'll never ever mention it in front of others, you might literally destroy her life.", "YTA - you\u2019re literally blackmailing your sister", "YTA. Big time. She's 11 and most kids have stopped wetting the bed way long ago. It's extremely embarrassing and mortifying. Disclosing such an information to her peers will annihilate her social life and make her a red-hot target for bullies. \n\nEven if you say you had no intention of doing so she does not know it and in all seriousness believes that you will. \n\nYou are essentially bullying her yourself, threatening and blackmailing. \"If you don't stop i will babble, if you don't leave i will babble, if you don't do what i say/want i will babble\". \n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself. It sounds harsh and it is harsh but it's the truth. Apologize to your sister. Next time she will annoy you (100% will happen an infinite number of times) do not lash out. Inform the parents about it. \n\nAs to your parents hope that the issue will resolve itself/she will outgrow it. It won't. Night wetting at this age speaks either of a medical problem that needs to be investigated or it has a psychological basis. Either way your parents should get their asses in gear and seek help for their child.", "Wow.  Ya know, I never stooped to blackmailing my younger siblings.  I just told Mom whatever crap they were up to.  Cut through a lot of the drama and a lot of the crap.\n\nTell your parents how the whole thing started, then promise not to blackmail her over this again.  I mean...if kids in her age group found out she'd never hear the end of it.  That kind of bullying/trauma can lead to all sorts of badness.  I'm talking self harm here kid.  So no.  Don't do that to your sister.\n\nYTA", "YTA - and a bully. Pick on someone your own size.", "YTA. There is definitely a better way to deal with your annoying sister than bullying her. You may want to have a good relationship with her some day - this will ruin any chance for that. Hope you figure out a way to get your needs met without hurting others!", "YTA   You were being a bully. There are other ways to convince an annoying sibling to leave you be or enlist your parents help.", "Yep, YTA.  I'm the oldest sibling, and while it's a given that the oldest typically torments their younger siblings, you do \\*not\\* shame them.  \n\nMy oldest daughter told her younger twin sisters that there were monsters under her bed so they would stay out of her room.  (I didn't find out about it until they were adults).\n\nWhat she didn't do was tell her sisters friends that she had terrified them by telling them there were monsters under her bed, or her own friends for that matter.  \n\nYou're 15.  Get some maturity under your belt fast.", "YTA. You\u2019re a bully. Be better.", "Major asshole.", "I get it. Little sisters can be a PITA. I have one and she really got on my nerves when we were your age.\n\nI hate to break it to you, but YTA. You're 15 years old. You need to learn that there are boundaries. Some things aren't to be joked about or teased about. Your sister's medical condition is one of these things that's out of bounds. \n\nPut yourself in *her* position. Would you want *you*r friends and *your whole school* to know that you still wet the bed? Can you imagine how miserable *your* life would be if that news got out?\n\nBe cool about it, and apologize to your sister and your parents. Your sister will probably grow out of bedwetting. But if her condition was made public by you as an act of revenge, that's something that might never get better, that she might never \"grow out of.\" It could really mess up her life.\n\nKeep in mind that sisters get better with age. It won't be long until she's not a brat anymore. You may even be great friends, like I am with my sister now that we're adults.\n\nJust chalk this one up to a learning experience.", "YTA. You\u2019re mean for no reason other than to be mean. You\u2019re a bully. That\u2019s not how you should treat anyone much less family.", "YTA, the fact that you continued to use something like that to manipulate your little sister is disgusting. As the oldest of four, I\u2019m disappointed and disgusted by how you have conducted yourself.", "YTA. you\u2019re bullying and shaming your sister for something that she clearly has no control over. and the fact that she let it go on for a bit without telling your parents, that your dad had to overhear it for anything to be done shows that she was terrified of you. you\u2019re so high up on the AH scale it isn\u2019t even funny. you need to apologize and take this punishment as a time to reflect on why you think shaming/threatening someone for a medical condition is okay. would you shame someone with cancer? diabetes? i hope not.", "YTA you\u2019re blackmailing your sister to tell her friends about her medical condition\u2026you\u2019re weak and pathetic!", "YTA \n\nThis is mental and emotional abuse you do realize that don't you? \n\nYou may not have meant to cause harm but you've probably caused your sister undue mental trauma when she's at a severely sensitive age about something she has no control over and very well could be a medical condition.\n\nYou have a fuck ton of apologizing to do here if you give a damn about her at all kid. Not cool. \n\nMy sister has a medical condition, and as a kid she'd sometimes have accidents and poop her pants so to ensure no one ever knew she had to wear pull ups to school and even though no one ever found out it was still hard on her mentally because she knew she'd never live it down if they did.", "YTA and a terrible big brother. Lucky you aren't my kid or I'd ground you for a week for every time you threatened to tell her friends.", "NTA. How else do they want you to deal with her?? Next time she\u2019s being a PITA just call your parents and inform them of her behavior.

Your little sister was being a bratty pest, but that does not even come CLOSE to justifying your threats.  You stooped too low.  Have a little compassion.", "YTA and I\u2019m kind of shocked at how light your punishment is considering you\u2019ve been holding your sister hostage on threat of public humiliation for weeks now.

Threatening people who annoy you is not how you deal with conflict. \n\nSome advice from a little sister: When she was first bothering you, you could have said \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go ask mom and dad if you\u2019re allowed to watch Dexter.\u201d Either she follows you and it\u2019s their problem now or she leaves so that you won\u2019t tell your parents.

However, it's not too late to redeem yourself though. Continue your punishment until it's over and don't do it again. I get the feeling that you feel remorse. Apologize to your sister as well. She's only 11, she'll be annoying, but when she grows up, you two could have a great brother-sister relationship and she'll even feel safe coming to you with her problems. And I do agree with an earlier comment. Your parents may need to take her to a doctor, to make sure everything is ok. Honestly, an 11 year old still wetting the bed is not as normal as you'd think. She could have some kind of physical issue or psychological issue that needs to be addressed.  \n\n\nEdit: Also, your parents seem to be unfavorable. They're hoping her issue will go away? No, they need to get off their butts and take her to a doctor. Also, if they would blame you for her watching Dexter, when you told her multiple times to get out and she didn't listen, it should be her fault and not yours.

I am still so heartbroken and ashamed that I could hurt my brother in that way. \n\nBut I learned 2 really important things from that incident: \n\n1) When you know someone in the intimate way of family or close friends or romantic partners, you learn the things that will really hurt them. \n\n2) That is a terrible power to wield. \n\nI said that thing to my brother in that fight because I knew it would hurt him, but until I said it, I had not appreciated HOW MUCH it would hurt him. And I learned in that moment that I NEVER wanted to do that again. Of course, I have still subsequently said things in arguments that I regret, but not in that way. I have never since knowing leveraged someone\u2019s vulnerabilities against them. \n\nThis is tricky because you didn\u2019t realise the gravity right away and continued to use this hurtful insecurity against her - but you HAVE now, so that\u2019s a good step. I think you can salvage your relationship with by appologizing and admitting your mistake, but reassuring her that it was an empty threat (and never making it again obviously), and by finding ways to build her up - and build your relationship in positive ways together. \n\nI also think it\u2019s worth having a calm/non-defensive conversation with your parents. It\u2019ll be important to apologise and convey to them that you understand how hurtful your actions were. But I do think it\u2019s also worth having a conversation about the root of this issue, which started with you being held responsible for your sisters\u2019 behaviour. To be clear, this is NOT an excuse for your response, but I think this was a subtle mis-step on your parents part. They are starting to see you as more of an adult and treating you accordingly. (Ex. It is normal that adults are responsible for ensuring that children in their vicinity don\u2019t see any inappropriate video that the adults want to watch). But they might have forgotten/miscalculated that you and your sister will probably never have an adult-child relationship because you are siblings and grew up together. Your sister isn\u2019t going to listen to you the way she might an adult and obviously you are struggling in finding healthy ways of maintaining privacy/boundaries. So I do think your parents should be part of supporting you in that - and helping your sister learn about respecting her sibling\u2019s boundaries. \n\nYTA \n\nBut all the best growing through this.", "Without disclosing how long, I wet the bed for years. It was terrifying wondering if I'd have an accident at sleepovers, and if I did, I'd have to find a way to hide it. This is after hiding if I had on a pull-up. I have 2 siblings, one I still don't get along with. But by God, if anyone made an attempt to make fun of me for that, they'd be eating out of a straw.\n\nThis problem contributed to years of self-esteem issues. Protect your sister. She may just want to hang out with yiu.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, but youre also a kid.\n\nLook what you did is wrong but do you know why? Because even though your sister was annoying what you were threatening to do was humilating her. It is a form of manipulation. Your sister cant help her problems and you were taking the nuclear option of upending her life because...of a show? Or other small things? You put fear into her.\n\nWhen my kids fight i make sure they know that when they are grown theyre not obligated to be friends. You hope they will be-- but deep hurts cant be forgiven sometimes. Tread lightly on the humiliation. Youll have a friend waiting for you in later years.", "how else is he supposed to get her to stop doing stuff she isn\u2019t supposed to do lol", "I have had severe sleep apnea my whole life and it caused me to wet the bed until I was 13 and had a sleep study done. I had to have surgeries and still struggle with apnea today but stopped wetting the bed within weeks. it\u2019s a serious health issue that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. I know a lot of people jump to trauma, but she might just not be breathing right. Either way, doctors visits are in order", "There is nothing wrong. Some children bodies can take longer to develop.", "Right. Everyone keeps ignoring that he\u2019s not allowed to have boundaries while simultaneously being held accountable for what she does.", "that\u2019s what weakness are for? lmao", "Tell the parents?", "You were still teasing her to get something out of it. Her bugging you about wanting to watch Dexter was just her trying to do an activity you were doing. What you do instead of preying on an insecurity is to tell her your are actually done watching Dexter for now and offer to watch something else or maybe play a game with her.\n\n Or if you don't want to hang out with her, still tell her you are done watching Dexter, but say you were just wanting some time to yourself and you will watch something with her later.\n\n Just saying get out of my room so I can watch something you are not allowed to is just making her want to watch it more.", "until they were EIGHTEEN??", "It's definitely way more common than people realize. My youngest still has accidents and he's almost 13. I took him to his pediatrician for years and they said it's normal and he'll eventually grow out of it. I didn't believe them when it continued so I took him to a pediatric urologist. They told me it was normal but they ran tests to put me at ease. Physically he's perfectly healthy, he just doesn't always notice his body's signals until it's too late. The urologist had to explain that many kids have accidents all the way into their teens and it's not something to worry about unless there's pain or known trauma.", "Sure its more common in kids with Trauma but it's also still pretty common. While I can't argue I didn't have trauma growing up, my issues didn't really happen until after I was done wetting the bed. I also know another little girl who was in pull ups for a little while and I'd be super shocked to hear she had a traumatic childhood.\n\n Her dad is the best man I've ever met and her mom is pretty cool too and all 4 kids seem super well-adjusted now. The oldest actually just graduated and is attending a beauty school. \n\nIf it wasn't common enough they wouldn't make such a widely avaliable product for it and parents of bedwetters would be investigated for child abuse.", "My sister would often wet the bed at that age too. She was a heavy sleeper and wouldn\u2019t wake up when she had to go pee", "Do you have a degree in pediatric gastroenterology? Or pediatric gastro-psychology?  \n\nThose are not degrees for \u201cfoster care\u201d or \u201ctrauma\u201d and it\u2019s hurtful you say that.  \n\nDo you know children who have allergies or intolerances or irregular bowel muscle movements as a young child can struggle with potty training and it can cause lasting psychological stressors?\n\nPeople have anxiety and issues. Kids have anxiety and issues. And kids have anxiety and issues over potty things\n\nPlease try to come from a place of understanding and not judgement.", "And remember folks, 5% is 1 out of 20 kids. That's pretty common", "Finally, a relevant statistic in this thread", "The first part is true the second part is not. It has been documented that trauma can cause it", "i am not judging, not sure where you got that from. i never said trauma was the *only* cause. simply that *they* saw it more bc *they* work in foster care.", "Bedwetting can be the result of abuse or trauma, but also I wet the bed in middle and high school because I was so sleep deprived I wasn't waking up to go to the bathroom if I had to go in the night. It started happening again when I was pregnant. There's all sorts of reasons why it happens.", "I did it when I was in my late 20s. Had a dream I was on the toilet. In the dream I realized it was a dream and was hoping I didn\u2019t wet myself as I\u2019m waking up.", "Trauma CAN cause it but OP\u2019s sister\u2019s experience with the disorder has clearly caused some level of psychological trauma for her", "I was a bedwetter growing up. Once every other few years as an adult I might still accidently pee just a little. I'm such a deep sleeper and sometimes those dreams where you are peeing can trick me. It's never a full bladder but enough to change undies and maybe pants. Doctor wasnt too concerned since it's not really a constant thing. Just said I should work on trying to recognize when its a dream or maybe not overhydrate before bed when especially tired.", "My nephew is nine and has to wear the pull ups. The doctor has said he\u2019ll grow out of it eventually, and honestly he doesn\u2019t do it much anymore. It is pretty common, unfortunately it\u2019s just kept quiet because it\u2019s so embarrassing for a kid."]}
