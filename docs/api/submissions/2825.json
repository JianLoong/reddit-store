Calling you stupid and calling you nasty stuff is not a good reaction.", "Just a question, could he have been referring to you as his \u201cman\u201d and agreeing with you saying that you hated it? I\u2019m only asking as people can grow and change their opinions, I know a man who was heavily involved in racist groups while he was a teenager and if you\u2019d ask him at that time he\u2019d say he was 100% racist. By the time he was 25 he\u2019d learnt a lot and realised just how wrong he was, he now has a black wife and 5 mixed race children plus grandchildren and is the first to stand against racism. He says he knows that he can never fix what he did or said at that time and he\u2019s ashamed of himself for it, he actually works with young people and tries to show them there is another way and he uses himself as an example", "He didn\u2019t get arrested, he only got questioned and a warning.

It\u2019s just really difficult tbh.", "He's a racist. He's been questioned about it, he hasn't been actively anti-racist where you can see it and he's supporting other people's right to be racist.   \n\n\nBut honestly, if you think it's something that people can agree to disagree about and still be friends? You're supporting racism too and showing that you're only anti-racist when it's convenient and easy.", "So, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re okay with being friends with someone who does racist things, and treats other people horribly? You realized people probably assume that you\u2019re also a racist who treats people horribly? People are judged by the company they keep, and right now you\u2019re keeping company with a racist AH. You\u2019re condoning his behavior and racism, only because he hasn\u2019t been shitty to you\u2026 yet.\n\nYou can do better, OP.", "If you care about this  person, you owe him honesty. \"As your friend, I must tell you that when you say X, Y or Z, that is racist. You are better than that. Please talk to a therapist to find out where these attitudes come from. If you continue saying things like that, i will have to step away from our friendship.\"", "Not all racists are 100% bad people: they can be very good to people they care about,  and even towards people they see as inferior (I have aunts that are all about \"we have to help those poor people\" not recognizing that assuming all black people are poor is all kinds of racist. They are adamant that they are not racist.)  \n\nYour friend is a good person to you,  and is very sensitive to a very embarrassing point in his life. The thing is,  most of us have to work very hard to first see our own racism and then to eliminate it. Your friends doesn't like the racist label and doesn't want to be a racist, which is a good thing. What you may be seeing in his actions may be embedded racist thoughts that he hasn't ferreted out yet. Don't give your friend the label racist, but do give him quiet feedback \"I know you're not racist, but that comment sure sounded like you were supporting a racist statement.\"  \"That seemed like a microaggression when you said he was articulate for a black man.\" Ask him to help you,  too. Admit that not being racist is hard because you don't always see when something comes across as racist and could he give you a nudge if you do or say something that is racist."]}
