She is a great cook and learned from her Italian grandma but she can make almost everything under the sun. She travelled a lot when she was younger and loves Asian food the most. I thought I was a good cook but she says my cooking is terrible. She took over the cooking now that we live together and tried to teach me but then got impatient because she thought I wasn\u2019t trying. I am but she gets mad when I don\u2019t get it the first time. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s that great of a teacher. \n\nShe got mad because I didn\u2019t check if my chicken was done by cutting into it and making sure it isn\u2019t pink. I usually just poke it like she does but she insists I should cut into it because I\u2019m not very experienced. Recently she\u2019s wanted me to cook once a week and I\u2019ve been trying even though it\u2019s clearly not coming out very well. She is a way better cook why doesn\u2019t she just cook? She clearly enjoys it but she insists I have to learn. I can feed myself but I don\u2019t feel the need to get as good as her. Clearly her food is better but I can survive on my cooking so it\u2019s good enough for me. \n\nAnyway I cooked chicken and broccoli and she ate a few pieces and then got up and cut up the chicken and it was pink. She got really angry and yelled at me for trying to give her food poisoning. It\u2019s clearly just a mistake and I apologized but she had diarrhea for a few days and had to miss work. Now she won\u2019t cook for me and just cooks for herself. I usually eat out now that she doesn\u2019t pack me Tupperware and it\u2019s really sad because it\u2019s one of the things I really enjoyed. Sitting down for lunch and seeing what she made for me. I told her she is punishing me for no reason and she\u2019s gotten mad and told me I intentionally didn\u2019t cook the chicken right and Im always expecting her to cook like Im a kid. Im pretty pissed by her comments and we\u2019ve argued over it but I guess it\u2019s her right not to cook for me.", "created_utc": 1701223450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186dtqd/aita_for_wanting_my_gf_to_cook_for_me_after_i/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My brother got salmonella from undercooked chicken in college. He was in the hospital for *a week.* He was shitting blood. He couldn\u2019t even keep water down without puking. He almost died.

Which means you're an asshole because if you can't bring yourself to learn well enough to cook a little bit without poisoning people, then you're not really trying, and it means that you're taking her for granted. After all, why shouldn't she do all that work for you without a break? I mean, cooking every day of the week, all the weeks of the year... whyever would anybody object that?

I thought briefly about going with E S H because from only what you've said here her reaction seems immature and over the top, but it reeeeaaaalllllly sounds like this is a straw that broke the camel's back situation. You don't stop cooking for your partner because they screwed up dinner. It happens. You stop cooking for your partner because you feel like you're being taken advantage of and trying to talk about it hasn't worked.\n\nLook, I love to cook and am quite good at it. But cooking for two people 2-3 meals a day is a chore, the same way that loving to work on your car doesn't mean you necessarily enjoy changing the oil or rotating the tires. A very common complaint among good cooks, especially women, is the assumption that since they're better at and/or enjoy cooking that whole job should fall on them. And should it even really count as part of your share of the housework? It's really just getting to do your hobby, right?\n\nThere's a *lot* of that running through your post. It sounds like what your girlfriend is really upset about is expressing to you that she doesn't want to do all of the work of cooking every day, which is totally reasonable, and you decided that in that case it's her job to teach you to cook and her fault if you don't learn rather than your job to figure out how to take some of it off her plate. You're blessed to have a partner who's an excellent cook and you're treating it like an entitlement. Have you tried to learn how to make anything on your own? YT is great for this stuff. Or alternately if cooking just really, really isn't your thing, have you considered talking to your girlfriend about whether she's be willing to keep doing all of it if you took over more of the other work of running the household?

I don't even eat meat and I can do this without even tasting it.\n\nLearn to cook some very basic, idiot-proof meals. You don't even have to cook meat if you're both worried about undercooking it.

There are so many things I could say about all this, but I'm going to address the attitude about how she loves to cook, so she should just do it. I love to cook.

I'm like your girlfriend in that I consider myself to have a certain level of mastery over this skill (and it is a skill, not just a hobby).\n\n However, cooking for another person every single day of my life is tiring. There are days when I need someone else to take the mental load, sometimes even just ordering out. The thing is, when you're \"good at cooking,\" everyone expects you to just do it. Cooking is work. It's physical labour, especially if you're a responsible cook who cleans as you go, as you should. Standing or moving in a small space, bending over pots or dishes, etc, tends to aggravate the lower back as well.\n\nNgl undercooked chicken seems like weaponized incompetence, barring a serious issue with your ovens' temperature. You could literally follow a \"add a can of this and a cup of that\" type recipe and be fine, but the fact is you actually don't appreciate the work your girlfriend is doing. You say in one sentence that she's gifted, then in another that it's not that big of a deal. Even if it is a hobby, it's obviously something important to her, and you're dismissing it. You keep saying you would be fine fending for yourself, but I bet you'll be complaining or stealing her food if/when she decides that she's gonna call your bluff and just cook for herself.

Would she be willing to cook some nights and you buy takeout for you guys on other nights? Did you help with the dishes when she cooked for you?", "ESH, yall are not really communicating. Getting her sick may have been a total accident but it was still your fault.

She is a great cook and learned from her Italian grandma and can make almost everything under the sun. She travelled a lot when she was younger and loves Asian food the most. I thought I was a good cook but she says my cooking is terrible. She took over the cooking now that we live together and tried to teach me but then got impatient because she thought I wasn\u2019t try. I was but she gets mad when I don\u2019t get it the first time. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s that great of a teacher. \n\nShe got mad because I didn\u2019t check if my chicken if done by cutting into it and making sure it isn\u2019t pink. I usually just poke it like she does but she insists I should cut into it because I\u2019m not very experienced. Recently she\u2019s wanted me to cook once a week and I\u2019ve been trying even though it\u2019s clearly not coming out very well. She is a way better cook why doesn\u2019t she just cook? She clearly enjoys it but she insists I have to learn. I can feed myself but I don\u2019t feel the need to get as good as her. Clearly her food is better but I can survive on my cooking so it\u2019s good enough for me. \n\nAnyway I cooked chicken and broccoli and she ate a few pieces and then got up and cut up the chicken and it was pink. She got really angry and yelled at me for trying to give her food poisoning. It\u2019s clearly just a mistake and I apologized but she had diarrhea for a few days and had to miss work. Now she won\u2019t cook for me and just cooks for herself. I usually eat out now that she doesn\u2019t pack me Tupperware and it\u2019s really sad because it\u2019s one of the things I really enjoyed. Sitting down for lunch and seeing what she made for me. I told her she is punishing me for no reason and she\u2019s gotten mad and told me I intentionally didn\u2019t cook the chicken right and Im always expecting her to cook like Im a kid. Im pretty pissed by her comments and we\u2019ve argued over it but I guess it\u2019s her right not to cook for me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
