He told me my two duties living there would be to do the dishes and take out the trash. I only ended up living there for a couple of weeks and then moved in with my gf instead (who I still live with 4 years later).\n\nHowever, I go there every Wednesday and still do the dishes (which I literally haven't used even once) and take out the trash. If I said \"No, I have plans tonight\" he would get very angry and send me angry texts. He's a very intimidating person so I'm scared to disobey him essentially.\n\nHe usually prepares the dishes in the sink for me to clean. However, he's started doing jiu jitsu training which he does on Wednesdays now, so he wants me to do the entire thing myself.\n\nHe watched me do it this time and I made some mistakes (like putting too much detergent in or placing the dishes in the wrong way) and he went BESERK at me. Screaming at me like \"You're a fucking idiot!!! How could you mess that up?? You're a useless sack of shit!!\". I'm not talking normal yelling, I mean SCREAMING at me in a booming voice like a drill sergeant. The whole time I just looked down like \"Sorry, I feel a bit stressed\" and was shaking but he kept screaming to the point where I was making more mistakes because I was nervous.\n\nI feel like this is a really nasty thing to to, especially considering as I'm essentially doing him a favor. I take the train for nearly 2 hours and can't make any plans on Wednesday nights just so I can clean his dishes which I don't even use. This was worse than usual, but basically every time he just bullies me when I'm doing the dishes and I never argue back because he'd just get angry. He'll say things like \"Why do you have no social skills? Why are you not witty/funny?\" and basically dig into all my character flaws for an hour. Nothing prompts this, I never criticize him or anything and he literally just comes up with random character flaws to dig into me with. I can't even remember the last time he ever said something positive about me, 100% of interactions involve some kind of criticism or insult towards me. That's all he does every week for 4 years and it really gets me down. Some of the time it is actually valuable advice (albeit told to me in a mean way), but often it's just plain nasty insults and flaws which I can't change (like my intelligence or social skills).\n\nI understand that I initially agreed to to these chores, but at fact is that I don't live there anymore and barely even did to begin with. I think I'm well within my right to stop doing these chores if I want to, because I didn't agree to essentially be a slave for 4 years and get bullied every time I go there.\n\n\ntl;dr My brother makes me do his dishes every week and screams at me everytime I make a mistake.
