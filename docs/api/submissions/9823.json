It sounds like your understanding of EDS is pretty surface-level, especially if you don't understand why someone with a connective tissue disorder can wake up exhausted despite resting. What's even more baffling is that you're seemingly unaware EDS is progressive, it effects your life span, and your friend is 51.

Other times, I have something approaching a \"flare\" and I can sleep 18 or more hours a day and still be absolutely exhausted.

I work in non-traditional employment in an effort to compensate for these wild variations.   \n\n\nYour son is very lucky that he is able to maintain a traditional 40-hour/week schedule and I sincerely hope for his sake that that remains the case for him, particularly since you don't seem to be terribly understanding.

I mean, you sound like an expert from knowing your son has it, so I would have assumed you would be a little more aware and empathetic.  Clearly this is not the case.\n\nFrom there - you decide to attack your friend, tell her that she's lazy and question her ability to feel tired.  Um, why?   Honest question - why did you think you needed to take that approach with her?  Do you not like her?  Are you trying to be mean?  Are you trying to hurt her?  Because it sounds like you were trying to.\n\nYou also said that you offered to help her, so I will assume you showed up when it was good for you and went to work.  What if she didn't really want you to do it but felt obligated to say yes (and who passes up someone's offer to help?). But then you felt like you had the RIGHT to question her not helping.\n\nI don't think you sound like a nice person.  Your entire post is very dismissive of your friend and you go overboard in minimizing her issues so that you can do what you want, and tell her whatever you think should be happening.

For some people it's not much more than being double-jointed and a higher risk of dislocations. For other people it affects the way their entire circulatory system works, leading to low blood pressure, POTS, heart issues - which can lead to brain fog and exhaustion as their body struggles to keep the brain supplied with oxygen. Sleep isn't refreshing when you keep waking up in pain. Assuming you can sleep at all - if your bp is low, lying down may wake you up as suddenly your body doesn't have to work as hard to get blood to the brain. \n\nGetting a diagnosis of EDS can take years, and the process often involves meeting a lot of people who will question whether you're sick at all, or \"just lazy\".

Most of the time it doesn't effect your ability to drive. \n\nThey did learn, but reckless driving caused them to lose their license permanently. They never once caused injury or harm to anyone while driving but I was in the car with them once, them rollerblading is a good thing and they are very happy with this adaption. \n\nThey live in a city as well so their commute style is a perfect choice, they also bike which they love. When they need to go anywhere far away we all jump in and offer and they happily take us up on it but their day to day is rollerblading/biking.\n\nETA: the reckless driving preceded their in-patient stay and they could probably get their license back (I don't know all the ins and outs of the DMV) but they are actually very happy with where they are and the adaptations they've made, it's like their own way of \"being in control of their disorder\" and I'm not one to poke holes or disagree with something that is working for them, ya know?", "I mean, it could affect your ability to drive.

She could have those, or any number of undiagnosed things, in addition to her EDS.\n\nAlso, as others have said, EDS can present differently in different people. Not everyone is the same. Like I don\u2019t have to pop a dislocated shoulder into place often like a friend of mine does, but she doesn\u2019t have to  fix her thumb like I do. \n\nYou owe her an apology for calling her lazy. That was rude and ableist.", "Is your son a 51 year old woman?  Then not the same thing.", "And one of the main symptoms of Type 3 EDS is extreme tiredness!!

I have POTS, sometimes it's all I can do to be awake 2-4 hours. Standing and bending over, forget about it. I faint sometimes, others it's just severe nausea, headaches, light headedness. It completely wipes my energy when it happens and I just fall back asleep.\n\nSo you're kind of right, she may have more the EDS going on, making you judgmental. YTA", "I have type 3. I am chronically exhausted. I can't work. I can barely function. There's another data point for you. In my EDS groups, there are literally thousands of other people, mostly women, who say the same thing.\n\nIt also doesn't affect everyone the same way, even within the same type, even in the same family. Some are barely affected while others are pretty much crippled by it.\n\nPlus it's widely known in the EDS community that women who have EDS are affected far more than men. It has to do with hormone levels and how the affect collagen.", "Again EDS is progressive!  Meaning obviously someone who is younger very well maybe much less affected than someone who is older.
