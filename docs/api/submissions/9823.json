It sounds like your understanding of EDS is pretty surface-level, especially if you don't understand why someone with a connective tissue disorder can wake up exhausted despite resting. What's even more baffling is that you're seemingly unaware EDS is progressive, it effects your life span, and your friend is 51.

Other times, I have something approaching a \"flare\" and I can sleep 18 or more hours a day and still be absolutely exhausted.

I work in non-traditional employment in an effort to compensate for these wild variations.   \n\n\nYour son is very lucky that he is able to maintain a traditional 40-hour/week schedule and I sincerely hope for his sake that that remains the case for him, particularly since you don't seem to be terribly understanding.

Honest question - why did you think you needed to take that approach with her?  Do you not like her?  Are you trying to be mean?  Are you trying to hurt her?  Because it sounds like you were trying to.\n\nYou also said that you offered to help her, so I will assume you showed up when it was good for you and went to work.  What if she didn't really want you to do it but felt obligated to say yes (and who passes up someone's offer to help?). But then you felt like you had the RIGHT to question her not helping.\n\nI don't think you sound like a nice person.

For some people it's not much more than being double-jointed and a higher risk of dislocations. For other people it affects the way their entire circulatory system works, leading to low blood pressure, POTS, heart issues - which can lead to brain fog and exhaustion as their body struggles to keep the brain supplied with oxygen. Sleep isn't refreshing when you keep waking up in pain. Assuming you can sleep at all - if your bp is low, lying down may wake you up as suddenly your body doesn't have to work as hard to get blood to the brain. \n\nGetting a diagnosis of EDS can take years, and the process often involves meeting a lot of people who will question whether you're sick at all, or \"just lazy\".

Getting proper help is crucial but usually extremely difficult.\n\nHave you ever dealt with chronic pain? Chronic health problems? No? Let me tell you, they can take a LOT out of a person. It\u2019s that much more exhausting when you \u201cmask\u201d meaning hide the pain so you don\u2019t feel like a bother.\n\nYour friend is 51. EDS gets worse as you age. My daughter is 22. She deals with chronic pain and all the joints in her legs frequently dislocate as well as her shoulders and a couple vertebrae. Some people her age are already wheelchair bound. I pray that she\u2019s not when she\u2019s your friends age. Your son is lucky. Don\u2019t compare him to your friend.", "YTA\n\nLess than 10 minutes with Google and I know symptoms can vary between individuals AND fatigue can be a common symptom.  Do you pay this much attention to all of your families needs?", "YTA. i have EDS and it causes me to barely leave the house. bffr, everyone\u2019s medical experiences are different and if your son does have EDS then you should know that there are many types and it\u2019s different for everyone. some may never know they have it, while others have daily implications. \u201csays she\u2019s diagnosed\u201d \u2026.. get a life, it\u2019s very odd to question someone\u2019s medical issues and the severity just because you know someone else with the same/ similar issue", "Wow, it's almost like illness/diseases/disorders affect different people differently! Or like some people have more good days than bad! Do you need to sit down to process that? I know it must be quite the shock to you.\n\nYTA. No one cares that your son learned to hide his bad days from you. That says a LOT about you as a parent actually... and none of it is good", "YTA. Yikes...", "man im in the middle of a fatigue attack and let me tell you, it's MORE than just being \"tired\". it's full body exhaustion. Everything aches. Thinking is hard, moving is hard, everything is just so much more difficult. \n\nEDS impacts everyone differently and also changes as you get older, not to mention can go through phases where it's not too bad and then plow you down like a truck. It often comes along with things like ME/Chronic fatigue, POTS, chronic pain and so on. \n\nThe past few years for me my joint stability has absolutely crashed off a cliff. I was always bendy, but the older i've gotten the  more unstable my joints have become, the more pain I just live with daily and the more exhaustion I battle. Apparently 1/3 of hypermobile people will get better with age, 1/3 stay the same, 1/3 get worse. how FUN. I'm not even 40 yet and i'm already struggling to get around, but 10 years ago I was fine. Unfortunately that's how it goes sometimes. Nowadays all my joints click and crack and slide about. I have ongoing back and hip problems, I constantly bite my tongue because my jaw clicks out of position constantly, I have headaches, neck pain, I fall over my own ankles constantly, I can't write without pain... the list goes on. All issues I did not have in my 20s. \n\nand that's just for hypermobility. EDS comes with a whole load of other great things like digestive issues, heart problems, brain fog and so on. \n\nCalling someone with a chronic disability \"lazy\" isn't just ablist as shit, it's outright cruel. You don't think those of us who sleep all day don't have better things to be doing with our time? You don't think we don't wish we COULD get up and do shit? I hate wasting the day away and I hate that feeling that i'm a burden to my family because I didn't get up til past noon and can barely walk. I already feel \"lazy\" and \"useless\" and all that other crap. Having someone articulate that would absolutely send me into a spiral of self loathing. \n\nYou're not just an asshole, you're a massive asshole for treating your friend like that.\n\nYou're not an expert of EDS so get the hell over yourself.", "YTA. Never mind the fact that not everybody will present the same even with the same conditions, but EDS is a group of something like 13 different conditions. Your son may not have the same type, and the different types present VERY differently. They can range from painful and annoying to life-threatening, and you do not have the medical training to be deciding how your neighbours version of the condition should or shouldn't be affecting her.", "HAHAHAHAHA you\u2019re awful and not a friend to this person. YTA. Good for your son, but everyone is different and like\u2026 30 seconds of googling and empathy would work that out.", "INFO: is your son also 51?", "YTA, also, just because your son doesn\u2019t complain it doesn\u2019t mean he has no problem.", "YTA and you could never understand the fatigue and pain we live with daily. Some people are affected more than others AND depending on how old your son is, it might have not \u201chit\u201d yet. I was a normal person until my early twenties and no matter what I did I slowly went downhill. \n\nBut omg YTA", "Yta. A huge one and your assumption just lost you a friendship. Fatigue is a common symptom. There are days were my partner will take over for a hour or two and let me nap because I am just so tired and exhausted and that's because of a flare up. It also effects everyone differently and especially at different ages.", "Thank you!! I also have type-3 and it drives me crazy how easily people dismiss EDS as a disability because they can\u2019t physically see it. I can\u2019t carry anything above 40-50lbs because my joints physically can\u2019t support the pressure against them. Having hEDS is physically exhausting because our muscles have to work extra hard to support our weight.", "It's that last sentence that gets me. \"My friend got upset so I left rather than apologise and comfort her.\" Like WTH? If something I said upset my friend, regardless of if I'm right or wrong, I would never just walk out on them!", "This is what i want to know too because there may have been an expectation they\u2019d do it together which is driving the irritation.", "I agree, ESH.", "You've come to the right place, my friend!\n\nEhlers-Danlos Syndrome is a condition that is not well known or understood both in medical settings and by the general public.

I have suspicions I have a mild version.", "That\u2019s good that you are ok now! (I never got it thanks god).\n\nI agree, when I read op post the first thing that pop up in my head is how animals respond and react when being sick. Even if it\u2019s the same sickness most animals will and can hide it for a long period of times (most common in cats). For example leptospirosis (it\u2019s zoonotic meaning animals can pass that disease to us) some symptoms can differ from pet to pet depending on their life style and if they are vaccinated. We can have the same symptoms as you\u2019re out but you might react differently (some symptoms are fever, muscle pain, abdominal pain, vomiting). A dog can vomit or not eat but they still react normally, where you feel like sht and aren\u2019t able to do anything. \n\n\nI will say some symptoms when it comes to animals can be confuse with other diseases. My dog got really sick and I thought she was a disease (I was worried it was parvo) but she only got sick and it was normal for her breed to have that symptom to some foods (they have a digestive problem)", "I have [Ehlers-Danlos](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/) (Type III hEDS, though access to genetic testing in my country is difficult) it's important to add that not only are there 13 types but that, **like any disorder, there is a *huge* spectrum.** 2 people with the same type can have unique experiences and different symptoms, and therefore entirely different medical and lifestyle changes to make the world more accessible for them. This is why disability requires equity over equality and reasonable adjustments specific to an individual.\n\n**EDS can range from practically asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe life-altering symptoms and multiple comorbidities.**\n\nI'm on the severe end and a full-time wheelchair user who is considered complex and requires constant care and medical interventions, but for many folks I've met with EDS it can be an invisible illness. We're all valid and deserving of access and understanding; even though we have the \"same diagnosis\", it impacts our lives in very different ways. However, we are *all* part of the zebra herd! \ud83e\udd93\n\nThough the 13 types impact many genetic components and classes of collagen and connective tissue, we share many common traits.\n\nP.S.

There are so many varieties of EDS, and OP just assumes it\u2019s all the same. There are types that cause severe progressive problems, some of which could very well cause tiring easily.

People should stay in their lane when it comes to another person\u2019s medical situation. Most people struggling with an illness are already low-having some unsympathetic friend trying to compare you with \u2018someone they know\u2019 and telling you basically to get over it or work harder is just gonna sink them down lower-or piss them off enough to shut you out.", "There\u2019s talk now that it\u2019s 14 types\u2026 12 can be found genetically.

I will add me and my brother almost have the same amune symptoms but most times medication won\u2019t work on me or it works slowly (the only medication that ACTUALLY does work fast is one my grandparents sent from Puerto Rico with their prescription and it not as expensive there). \n\n\nThe funny thing is I got sick again with the same thing but because I was already sick with it, I\u2019m not as bad as the first time (only a cough and mucus). \n\n\n\u201cI guess those people who died were just lazy\u201d\n\n\nI want to agree but I add these because of the likelihood that people are ignorant enough to not get vaccinated or ignored all the warnings that the government and medical professionals gave (and no I\u2019m not counting people that can\u2019t medically get any vaccine\u2019s) or they got it beforehand (like before it was a big thing)\n\n\nI will say by the path that life is taking us, Mother Nature is trying to kll us faster than us destroying the planet.", "Yeah...
