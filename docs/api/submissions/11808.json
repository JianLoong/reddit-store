The thing is my in-laws have insisted that I travel to their place which takes around 7 hours from my place. I wasn't comfortable travelling but i agreed. Now they want to change the date of my baby shower and it will be close to my 8th month which I feel is not very safe to travel and also since I work I cannot manage to take leaves during that date. The reason for this change is because my SILs 6 year old daughter has exams and she will not be able to attend this baby shower. Please note that she has exams the day after my baby shower . I told them that this wasn't feasible and I won't be changing the date just for her, while all my friends and family have been invited . Now my in-laws are mad at me for being so inconsiderate. My husband is on my side though. AITA?\n\nEdit: For all those asking why does a 6 year old have exams. It's a test but they call it exams here in my place. It's not a big deal to miss it but my in-laws don't want her to miss it as this test is something that will promote her to the next grade (according to them). \n\nI'm reconsidering the travel part now, although my doctor suggested I can travel with the proper medications provided.", "created_utc": 1678299227, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m3kpy/aita_26ffor_not_pushing_the_date_of_my_baby/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn\u2019t do that trip for a regular baby shower, let alone 8 months pregnant. It\u2019s absurd and also trying to fit you into the schedule of a 6 year old is even more bizarre. YWBTA if you go.", "NTA. Tell them they can move the baby shower, but as you can't get off for work at that time, they'd have to have it without you. So they can have it without the daughter or have it without you, you know, the one the party is actually for...", "That's too long to be in a car sitting while pregnant. Tell them if it safe for their grandchild and if they fight you on it then they can have it without you. A 6 yr old doesn't really need to be at a baby shower anyways.

My students are 5-7 and I have never given them exams.. the closest thing I\u2019ve experienced is the MAP test but it\u2019s not an exam in the traditional sense, and certainly not worth missing their aunt\u2019s baby shower for (when it\u2019s not even on the same day.)", "NTA\n\nWhat am I reading? Your in-laws seriously want your pregnant self to travel for 7 hours for a baby shower? That's ridiculous even 6th month, in the 8th it's a firm no. Are you willing to risk going into labor somewhere between your home and your in-laws' place? Are they willing to put you and your baby at risk for whatever life-changing exam a 6 yo will have?\n\nPlease, please insist that they travel that 7 hours to somewhere that's convenient for you.\n\nBest wishes to you and your little one!", "NTA. How did they not know about the exam when they agreed to the first date?

You can be having a perfectly normal pregnancy and suddenly it takes a turn. (A friend of mine ended up cancelling her baby shower. Normal pregnancy but she suddenly went into labor way too early. Her child arrived before the baby shower, and she didn\u2019t want to leave the NICU to attend a shower.) It sounds like the 6 year old has standardized tests that week. That\u2019s not like a high school or college student studying for exams. For a 6 year old taking standardized tests they recommend things like a good nights rest and make sure to have breakfast. It\u2019s not recommended to do a bunch of study prep because then the kids freak out just before and during the test.", "NTA.

Nothing about this sounds like it's worth your while or beneficial to you or your baby.\n\nI would say you should keep the date, reschedule the place to somewhere reasonable for you. If they don't want to show, that's their right, but the party will be better without them.", "NTA\n\nMedically speaking, you're not supposed to travel in the third trimester. It's too close to the due date to be away from your OBGYN and birth-planned hospital.", "NTA. Why are people like this? I just can't get my head around it. Tell them it was originally a lovely gesture, but that it will only be lovely if it isn't stressful, doesn't cause issues with your work and pay, and is medically feasible.

I wouldn't even make that trip at 7.5 months. Seven hours in a car that far along is a nightmare.  Do yourself a favor and cancel.  It is really rude that they expect the pregnant lady to make that trip.", "What kind of exams does a 6 year old have?

Let me get this straight, your in-laws think your inconsiderate when they don't take your schedule and being at least 7.5 months pregnant at the original date?  Isn't the basic function of the baby shower is to cater and provide gives to the one who is pregnant?  Everything you wrote about the in-laws are counter intuitive.  They are giving a 6 year old's test more importance than you which is highly inconsiderate (yes tests are important and the 6 year old can study around activities or not attend).  You and your future child are more important than what your in-laws are treating you two.  Don't travel, have your family and friends do a baby shower in your area.  If your in-laws want to attend then they can travel to you.", "NTA, but in your shoes I would just cancel altogether.  That's a terrible trip to make so late in your pregnancy, and the disregard is likely to continue.", "NTA  \nAre they throwing this shower for you, or for the kid?  \nYou're inconsiderate?

Don't go", "NTA\nAsk them who the shower is for her or you?\nWho is going to literally pop? Her or you?\nIf they give you more trash, cancel that one and have one at your place.

What's important is the baby about to be born, all those travel hours away from her doctors, needing medication to travel.   No, just no.", "Or extra time to study? Odd. OP 7 hours in a car at 8 months pregnant is going to be very uncomfortable IMO. If they want to be shitty they cancel the entire thing and let your family and friends shower you at home, or a local restaurant. NTA", "Depending on the pregnancy she can travel. She needs to talk to her OB though. There are a lot of questions. My first pregnancy I was fine to travel at 7.5 months. My OB was all for it.

Because unless you're high risk they usually don't stop travel until 36 weeks.", "This here.  The shower should be at OP's home or somewhere close by.  7 hours is a HUGE journey, but especially for someone pregnant.  And, what does OP's DH say about this?  She doesn't mention it.  Why isn't he saying \"hell to the no\" about travelling 7 hours while pregnant?  \n\nAnd the thing about centering around a 6-year-old's schedule is just silly.\n\nOP, tell (not ask) your DH to grow a shiny spine and tell his family that if they want to host a shower, he will determine the venue close by, at a date that works for OP and him.", "Maybe she's got to set some time aside to cram for Finger Painting.

It's bonkers that they expect you to shift your schedule for a six year-old who'd probably be bored anyway.", "NTA, and I think you should definitely rethink travel. Let them know you're happy to do the shower on either date near your home.", "WTF - a 6yo had an exam / test so had to miss the baby shower? not 16? or 26?  that child needs therapy NOW!\n\nI would design all future events to clash with something this SIL is up to because she will never be satisfied with you or your event.", "NTA, a 6 year old doesn\u2019t need to be at a baby shower.", "Also what kind of 6 year old has exams that mean anything.

Seriously if this is their idea of being \u201chelpful\u201d they really suck at it. If you keep bending to accommodate others you\u2019re eventually going to break.

We did it over two days and talked to my doctor beforehand. I understand not wanting to do it but in hindsight, I\u2019m really glad we went.", "And what kind of baby shower is this?? Baby showers tend to range from tame and boring to a fun but sober afternoon. Is the six year old going to get so drunk she won\u2019t be able to take her test?", "All my kids (6) had tests in kindergarten and 1st grade. Admittedly not scheduled crazy far out except for state testing but with my younger ones they now have tests at the end of the year to make sure they're ready to advance to the next grade. We've known all year about them (I'm not a fan of this. My 4th grader has been anxious over it).", "And is she getting gifts at this shower? Is she supposed to do the 7 hour drive home with a fully loaded car? This is all a terrible plan. OP they clearly aren\u2019t doing this for you. Don\u2019t go, see if your family or friends can have one locally. It\u2019s just not worth the stress."]}
