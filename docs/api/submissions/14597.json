Tell her off again for good measure.", "NTA. You correctly picked up the vibe that your sister is passive-aggressively telling you that you're inferior to people who got into other colleges. Don't apologize for something SHE should apologize for doing.", "You're being played for a fool by a huge loan industry that wants you to think going to a top college fresh out of high school matters at all. The financially intelligent decision is to spend at least a year in community college completing your general education requirements. Even if you have a college fund already, you can put that year's worth of tuition into a better car or something else you wouldn't have otherwise been able to afford. Trust me, for general education it's the exact same shit at community college just at a much lower price point. It also gives you another shot at applying to one of these top schools later on for your major requirements, who will be a lot more impressed with good grades at community college than concerned about bad grades in high school. Good luck!", "NTA-her reaction to you snapping is proof that what she was doing was intentional. A caring sister would have apologized immediately for not realizing she was hurting you. \n\nYes, you should have handled it better, but while you aren\u2019t sure of her motives, I definitely AM sure that it was intentional. Her response proved it, and let me also add that in the world of reach admissions, it is generally known that you DO NOT comment on admission status; its rude. You don\u2019t give your sister\u2019s age, but since she was raised in the same culture as you, and knows where others have gotten into, I have to assume that she SHOULD know this is the respectful norm. \n\nSo, stop doubting her motives, and realize that your sister WAS being mean, and you called her out on it, which is why she is now cold-shouldering you, when in actuality, you could be  cold-shouldering HER for being so insensitive and uncaring.\n\nEdited to add: this is my professional space. I work with about 300/400 families a year in high stakes admissions.", "1. Aside from few specific jobs it doesn't matter what school you go to. In fact you should pick the cheapest possible if you rely on loans to graduate.\n\n\n2. What matters is the degree you choose and what is the return on investment for that degree. For example i don't recommend you taking out 700k in students loans to become an engineer. Based on salaries of engineers you shouldn't take out more than 60k tops. \n\n\n3. Go on Glassdoor, pay scale, etc to learn about what can you expect to make for your chosen degree. Another resource is annual salary survey such as this one https://www.askamanager.org/2023/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-6.html\n\nThe one I linked is actually open and accepts entries so if you're working I encourage you to participate", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s an insensitive jerk", "Tiny bit YTA.\n\nYou're assuming she's doing this to rub your face in it, but from what you wrote you have some doubts. It seems like you didn't mention that you don't want to hear this in a nice way that she ignored - you jumped straight to attack mode.\n\nI don't think you're a bad person for that - just frustrated for pretty obvious reasons, but you're taking out your frustration on someone who doesn't deserve it.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI understand how frustrating that must be for you to hear about constantly, but there was a better way to approach this. Instead of waiting until you snap, a simple \"Hey sis, I know you mean well, but you sharing that my friend got into a college I got rejected from stings a little. I'd appreciate it if you refrained from telling me.\" \n\nThat way you've communicated your position before it becomes a problem. And if she still does it? Then you snap.", "From the info here, ESH but only a little. Your sister could\u2019ve read the room better, but it\u2019s possible that she didn\u2019t realize how much this was affecting you. You also shouldn\u2019t have snapped, but I understand why you did. I think it would be good to apologize for snapping when things have cooled off a little, and I\u2019m hopeful she\u2019d apologize to you for being thoughtless.\n\nFWIW, no one really gives a shit where you went to school once you start working. I hope you have a wonderful experience!", "Talk to her about why its making you feel upset. Very soft yta", "Kinda TA. I mean I get feeling bad but you could have said exactly the same thing calmly without blowing up.

From your post it doesn\u2019t seem you ever told her it made you feel bad, if anything you reacted happy and enthausiastic. \n\nIt may feel like she\u2019s trying to hurt you, but does she have a history of rying to make you feel inferior or is this just how you feel? Because feelings are not facts.\n\nApologize to her for snapping but explain your reasoning. Handle the situation like an adult.", "NTA.\n\nYou're allowed to be upset at her passive-aggressiveness (because seriously, I couldn't call that anything else), especially regarding her reaction when you confronted her about it AND her shitty comment regarding your friend who chose one of your potential colleges.\n\nI think she's just bitter because she can't get you to be as upset about the whole ordeal as she wants you to be. I'm assuming she's younger than you, and may be convinced that *she'll* end up with a \"better\" college, causing her to have an undeserved superiority complex. \n\nEither way, try to not let it get to you. Top colleges are nice, but decent ones are good too, and at least *you've* already accomplished actually getting accepted somewhere.", "First of all, congratulations on getting in college! I watched a lot of acceptance videos on Ivy Day and I saw lots where people with amazing stats might have been rejected by Harvard and Yale, but got into UVA or Vanderbilt, both top 20 schools. Heck, I saw one where the person was accepted by several Ivies, but was rejected by University of Texas Austin! A top 40 school to be sure, but not as prestigious as Yale (saw a ton of accepted by Harvard but rejected by Yale??).\n\nAnyway I also saw videos from people rejected by their \"dream\" school, but in hindsight the school they went to turned out to be a better fit, and they bloomed where planted .\n\nIf you find in a couple years the college or university isn't a good fit you can always apply for a transfer.\n\nYou can try talking to your sister when you are both calmer that her talking about other people getting in to a top school makes you feel that she is insinuating that you are a failure and it hurts.", "There\u2019s also online college. I\u2019m doing that now and literally all I pay for is my credits, textbooks (when they\u2019re not provided already in the class portal, and the technology fee.

I\u2019ll end up paying maybe 1/4 of the cost of 1 year at a regular 4 year college for my entire 4 years online.", "If you want a degree as a credential to get a job, then by all means, get it as cheaply as possible.  If you want to get an education, you should choose carefully.\n\nAs someone who went to a big state school, and then found himself competing and working with folks who mostly went to more prestigious schools, there's a difference.  Ask yourself if you want to be in a classroom packed full of folks whose biggest question  is \"Will this be on the test?\" or in a much smaller classroom full of folks who are each trying to be the best.  Which do you think will do more to prepare you to excel?\n\nAnd that's not even starting to think about networking, reputation, etc.", "The whole point is that she DID use her words, though.", "I am really baffled by this take.
