Don't apologize for something SHE should apologize for doing.", "You're being played for a fool by a huge loan industry that wants you to think going to a top college fresh out of high school matters at all. The financially intelligent decision is to spend at least a year in community college completing your general education requirements. Even if you have a college fund already, you can put that year's worth of tuition into a better car or something else you wouldn't have otherwise been able to afford. Trust me, for general education it's the exact same shit at community college just at a much lower price point. It also gives you another shot at applying to one of these top schools later on for your major requirements, who will be a lot more impressed with good grades at community college than concerned about bad grades in high school. Good luck!", "NTA-her reaction to you snapping is proof that what she was doing was intentional. A caring sister would have apologized immediately for not realizing she was hurting you. \n\nYes, you should have handled it better, but while you aren\u2019t sure of her motives, I definitely AM sure that it was intentional. Her response proved it, and let me also add that in the world of reach admissions, it is generally known that you DO NOT comment on admission status; its rude. You don\u2019t give your sister\u2019s age, but since she was raised in the same culture as you, and knows where others have gotten into, I have to assume that she SHOULD know this is the respectful norm. \n\nSo, stop doubting her motives, and realize that your sister WAS being mean, and you called her out on it, which is why she is now cold-shouldering you, when in actuality, you could be  cold-shouldering HER for being so insensitive and uncaring.\n\nEdited to add: this is my professional space. I work with about 300/400 families a year in high stakes admissions.", "1. Aside from few specific jobs it doesn't matter what school you go to.

Sometimes, often times, the schools get it completely wrong too.  These schools see tens of thousands of similarly overqualified students with nearly identical grades, extracurriculars and standardized test scores every cycle \u2013 it's honestly just the random things and sheer luck that will make one student more likely for admission than another, and why someone who looks to be \"above the curve\" will get denied, while someone who looks to be below it will be accepted.  \n\nIf you haven't had a chance to do campus visits yet, try to attend an \"admitted students day\".

While I did not attend a CC I made many friends at the university I went to who did and then transferred to my school. Countless times I heard that the educators at the cc were better at their jobs. Many high ranked universities hire professors because of their accomplishments in their field but are severely lacking in the skills of being an educator. \n\nAnd this was far from unique to my school. Heard and read about this many, many times. Including a friend who transferred from CC to Berkeley. \n\nAlso, \"overcharging\". Come on now, even if the quality of education they were providing were half of what it is, it still wouldn't be overcharging. CCs are quite cheap.

We had a chill chat and I went on my way, found out later that I got the job.\n\nA few years later that same person and I were chatting and he confessed that I was not the most qualified person, but he knew I was a good person and would get along with the existing team (something the person I was replacing was not able to do).\n\nIn the 20 years since I graduated this kind of thing has happened several times and I didn't even go to a particularly fancy college.\n\nOne of my highschool friends did go to a fancy college and the connections he's made there are mind blowing.  He's a lawyer in Toronto now but he picks up the phone and just calls people that were in classes with him out of the blue to ask favors (he's always been more extraverted than I am).  It blows my mind, these people have fairly powerful jobs and would not normally take a phone call from just some stranger.  But he says \"I'm so and so and we went to X together back in the day\" and the assistant puts his call straight through.
