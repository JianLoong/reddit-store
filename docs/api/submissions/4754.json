He never said happy birthday again, never even mentioned that it was my\nbirthday.

He said that we barely talked today, and he had already told\nme happy birthday. During our second phone call of the day, he had time to update me on the Warriors game but I guess he didn't have time to\ntell me happy birthday. I've spent the last hour crying. My coworkers, who I just officially met two days ago (I work from home), put more thought into my birthday than my husband did. I'm heartbroken, he thinks that he did nothing wrong. I don't know if I'm just entitled to expect more. \n\nI told him he should\u2019ve done more than send one text.

I know it\u2019s dumb but the only thing I expect was for him to mention it at some point today, like say happy birthday while we\u2019re on the phone or ask how it\u2019s going instead of sending a quick text and going on about his day.

What the fuck is up with these comments? I don't think it's weird that you want your husband to just say \"happy birthday\" once over the phone. Like, a text is nice and sweet but they are also not that personal? And it's not like it's hard???? I usually text people \"Happy Birthday!\" in the morning when it's their birthday even if I'm going to call them later. And when I call them kater the first thing out of my mouth is \"Happy Birthday!\". \n\nLike, I think that is basically all you wanted right, to hear your husband actually say those words using his voice? And for some reasons the comments are acting as if you want him to sing you a fucking concert of birthday song or tell you ever three minutes. \n\nIf he had time to update you on a sports game (which I assume is important to him) he could have had the decent to wish you a happy birthday and ask how your day was", "INFO: did either of you talk about the trip beforehand and how the two you felt about you being away for your birthday?", "NTA your feelings are valid: your needs are not being met. Does your husband know you\u2019re a birthday person? In that case you can give him some ideas next time. It\u2019s difficult for some people to make their partners feel cherished in the way they need to be cherished. \n\nI also want my partner to plan something if it\u2019s a special date. It shows me they care and think of me and know me. Don\u2019t just resign yourself to a birthday text, communicate and hopefully he\u2019ll remember next time.\n\nIt seems like you have nice coworkers however, so not all was bad that day!", "NTA and I don't understand the YTA comments. He sent one text at 1am, correct? That's what I got in the post. He texted and called at other times and didn't say it\u2014so I'm not sure why I'm seeing comments acting as if he said it frequently throughout the day. You got a single 1am text and then he didn't say it over the phone. Yeah, he could've at least said 'hey happy birthday, how's it going' when he called you and no, I don't think that's too much to ask.", "NTA: \nI would hope that he has something planned for you/y\u2019all at home. I may be a bit selfish but I would hope that my SO would at least do Something for me for my birthday in addition to a text. \n\nEven something as simple as him asking if your coworkers were going to be able to celebrate with you in lieu of him would show that he was thinking of you. It\u2019s the small daily moments where it\u2019s nice to be reassured that he cares and that he\u2019s paying attention.\n\nI would hope that if I were in this situation with my SO, he would make an effort to send flowers or something small to my hotel, maybe I\u2019m needy but it\u2019s one day a year and I deserve a bit of extra effort and thought.", "NAH. I think this is an example of having differing love languages and not communicating clearly. You\u2019re expecting him to do something based on what you value and he expects you do accept what he did based on his values. You guys need to sit down and talk about expectations and how to show love and care moving forward. \n\nYou can\u2019t hold your husband responsible for making you feel valued or filling the holes from your childhood. Those are things you need to work through on your own. \n\nYou were a bit dramatic and he was a bit clueless. Happens to all of us at one point or another. Have a conversation and let it go.", "YTA.  You are an adult. He wished you happy birthday once. Get over it.", "NAH, it sounds like you need to communicate and have more reasonable expectations.

He could do more than one text. Maybe call you and ask how your doing, how was your day, I love you. \ud83d\udc80Good God. Anything but one text. \n\nDon\u2019t get down by the Y T As, horrible opinions come early in posts.", "[deleted]", "NTA. He knows your love language, what hurts you from your past, and things you like. There's so many small gestures he could've done that cost him absolutely nothing.

He knows your trauma and the reassurance you need to know you're loved and he did the absolute bare minimum. Your feelings are valid.", "NTA he did the absolute bare minimum. Literally. He said Happy Birthday once. I understand why your feelings are hurt, sorry.", "NTA, it\u2019s normal to want that from your HUSBAND. One dry text is not enough.

I think the issue is that he planned nothing. Nothing before your trip. Nothing after your trip. Nothing on your trip. The issue isn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have flowers or cake sent to you. The issue is that he showed no desire to take you out to dinner or do something special in the basic timeframe of your birthday.\n\nI\u2019ve travelled on Mother\u2019s Day and my husbands bday. We always makes plans ahead of time so we are both on the same page about when our celebration will be. This way no one feels forgotten.", "NAH; it sounds like you have unresolved trauma and you got triggered when you were onna work trip. Sucks big time. \n\nTriggers happen and you can't always choose how you respond to them. That said, in itself your response was uncalled for. \n\nMy birthday is always a huge trigger, because there was no such thing as a day for me, growing up. Let alone a day to be friendly to me.\n\nI make sure to make a list. I tell my partner: \"I would like one of these gifts, but for me it's more important you take me out for dinner or do something fun with me. Surprises are super stressful, so please don't.\" I'd go as far as saying \"please say a few times that you like doing this activity with me.\"\n\nIt sounds stupid, but people can't guess your triggers, so you should communicate and deal with it. No matter how weird the solution might be.\n\nPlease apologize to your partner and co-workers. Make sure to explain to your partner what caused your response.", "Going against the grain - I think NTA. He had time to update you on a sports game, he could have asked how your birthday was. It costs him nothing! \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had a rough time growing up as well!

There are unresolved issues here on your end. I am the same\u2014I don't need anything big, but I'd just like to feel a little extra special on birthdays. I think this experience you've had should be a conversation starter between you and your boyfriend about gift-giving expectations. You should also communicate how you felt in this instance. Don't accuse him of anything. Simply tell him how you feel. Tell him your needs about gift-giving and birthdays. What will come from it is a better understanding of each other, and who knows\u2014the other commenters might be right in that your boyfriend has a gift when you get home.

Wow.", "It sounds like you have a lot of unresolved trauma regarding your birthday. It probably would be in your best interest to see a therapist if you aren\u2019t already seeing one.

Sorry but a ton of this subreddit thinks adults shouldn't expect anyone to acknowledge your birthday.\n\nIt's fine to celebrate birthdays as an adult, and expect your love language in that regard to be honored.  It's not okay to expect your loved ones to read your mind.  Since you said husband, not BF, I'm assuming dude damn well should know you'd be hurt by a single lazy ass text in the literal middle of the night, followed by stupid groaning about some sportsball game.\n\nI'd be livid in your shoes.  If you want to be grown up about it, have a conversation about it when you've calmed down.  If you want to be petty, spend his birthday prattling on about something he gives no shits about.", "YTA\n\nGet over yourself. You are an adult crying that your husband didn\u2019t say happy birthday *enough*? He texted you all day and called you twice, was that not enough? What more could he even do?\n\nBe grateful he remembered your birthday to begin with. Some people spend birthdays alone because people don\u2019t remember in the first place.", "YTA. Just\u2026 wow. What else was he supposed to do \u2026 send a singing telegram to your hotel? You are acting like a spoiled child.", "YTA. He wished you happy birthday, why does he need to do this multiple times?

I\u2019d get being upset if you were around him in person, but if you\u2019re away on a trip he probably didn\u2019t want to interfere with your business trip. I did long distance with my husband for years. On birthdays sometimes all we sent was a text. You should look at what your husband does on a day to day basis versus one day where he\u2019s not even around you to express love or affection. Does he help around the house, show affection, contribute financially, communicate well? That\u2019s far more important than this. I get that birthdays can be really important, but it\u2019s hard to make them important when you aren\u2019t in person with someone.", "YTA. What else did you expect from him?

For all you know he could have planned something for when you got home, but now that\u2019s soured by your guilt trip.", "YTA but I am sorry you feel hurt by this. There are a million ways to feel cared for that don\u2019t involve birthdays, but you should never rely on anyone else to make you feel important. It\u2019s a nice bonus when they do, but low self esteem in a partner is exhausting. A birthday is one day. What matters is the other 364 days-do you feel loved and cared for at other times? Is this the worst thing he\u2019s done? \nLet it go. It\u2019s a small slight in a lifetime.", "You are an adult. Did you call your mother? Did you thank her for giving birth to you? Did you even acknowledge the pain and struggle she went through giving birth and raising you? \n\nYeah, probably not.", "Sorry but YTA - look, you had limited time to talk today but he still wished you happy birthday. Maybe you could said something more like \u201cwhen I get back let\u2019s do something/ I\u2019m excited to do something for my birthday when I get back\u201d instead of being upset at him.\n\nAnd I get the coworker thing but it\u2019s kind of a bad comparison imo. You\u2019re coworkers probably want to maintain a good relationship with you, whilst your husband will be there when you get home with maybe a gift or two/your favourite meal. \n\nYou can ask for more here, but for today there were limits. Also Happy Birthday!!", "YTA. I know that this comes from a place of trauma, but he can\u2019t read your mind. You can tell him all about your trauma, and he can acknowledge it but he won\u2019t know how to fix it. Its unfair to expect him to fix your trauma for you. \n\nAnyway, if you had communicated with him that you wanted him to do something special for your birthday, I think he would have gone above and beyond for you because he loves you. And men are kinda dense tbh, you have to clearly communicate things to them so they reciprocate. \n\nIf it is trauma like I\u2019ve suspected, I would recommend you speaking to a therapist who can help you with healthy coping mechanisms and setting healthy boundaries.

I feel like you are just asking him to say it on the call. It's not that hard to say \"Happy birthday, love. How is your birthday going?\" I don't get why people are acting like it's too much to ask for. My friends and I always text each other happy birthday wishes when we wake up or go to bed (we all live in different timezones). And then when we have a chance to speak, we also say happy birthday and find out all about birthday activities.

Then he is fine.", "He texted you as soon as it became your birthday so by the time you talked to him (twice) he'd already said happy birthday to you. Probably did it at 1am because he was afraid he'd forget because (as you mentioned in a reply) you have stress and trauma around people not remembering your birthday. He prioritized remembering. How many times did you expect him to wish you a happy birthday? Does he say Merry Christmas to you all day long? \n\nIf this wasn't your 18th birthday, you need to chill out.

Do you prefer gifts such as jewelry, flowers, cards? Or him letting you know that dinner and a massage will be waiting for you when you get home? Or if he's a letter writer, a heartfelt note?

He's not taking you out or anything??", "Then I guess I do think he hasn't been considerate at all.

You should tell him he needs to do better as your spouse.", "I didn\u2019t include it in the original post because I didn\u2019t feel like it was necessary, but him treating me like an afterthought has been a continuous problem for us and I think that\u2019s why it upset me so much, one of those \u201cstraw that broke the camels back\u201d ordeals", "He could have had a cake delivered to her.

Hey, Friday at 7 pm we are going out for your birthday, attire nice dress or comfortable or whatever. \n\nShe has told her husband her expectation that she wants to do something, it seems like he could have just sung happy birthday in this instance she was have been so happy.

Because it's a nice way to make your partner feel wanted in the relationship. Just because some people don't do the bare minimum, it doesn't mean you're automatically off the hook for being inattentive to your partner in other ways. \n\n\nThis is obviously something that is important to OP, and its apparently something that she has expressed to him before. I dont think it makes her innately selfish for expecting her partner to show her that he cares. Communication is the base of all healthy relationships.

So you're mad that he didn't do more, but saying you weren't expecting gifts or surprises? What then did you expect, and how was he to know? And did you consider that he may have been bummed that you were away for your bday?\n\nEdit: lots of spelling errors", "Oh yeah I\u2019d be very upset if my partner had planned nothing at all for when I got back but OP is specifically upset she didn\u2019t get a follow up text that once again acknowledges her birthday, so we don\u2019t know if he actually didn\u2019t plan to celebrate her birthday at all. I used to stay up and wait until the next day to be the first person to say happy birthday to someone I cared about (sometimes I would lose track of time and I would end up messaging them a 1 am too) and not really say anything about it the rest of day so that could be an indication that he did actually put in effort to say happy birthday to her.\n\nBirthdays are just another day for my partner and I personally but it\u2019s the time we set apart to celebrate it that makes it special because we\u2019d rather express affection in person. If we were a long distance couple than I would 100% expect something like flowers to be delivered at my door but if I were gone for a short trip then I\u2019d rather receive flowers in person.\n\nEdit: nvm read through OP\u2019s comments and she\u2019s already communicated prior that she wanted more attention on her birthday through text. I can\u2019t imagine communicating to my partner that I would like small thing done for me to feel loved and he can\u2019t even go through with that because he has decided what\u2019s \u201cenough\u201d for me.", "Wait, is it actively your birthday *right now?*\n\nIf so, happy birthday. Sorry it didn't go as desired.\n\nAnyway... If you two knew how busy you were going to be, he likely sent the happy birthday in case you all didn't get a chance to talk. Not bringing it up later might just be because he is the type to think that saying something once is the correct number of times to say it. I *think* this probably falls to different communication styles. If that's true, NAH. But you would both need to work on a better way to communicate. Like, he says happy birthday over the phone instead of text, you let him know that you want him to ask about your day in these situations, etc. There are some people who don't like to talk about their workday while it is happening. I don't, so my wife will talk about a sports ball game to keep my mind off of it. I know nothing about sports. Still helps, oddly enough.\n\nI have to ask though: does he actually not care about your feelings? Does he usually forget about things that are important to you? Or are only feeling that way because you are upset? If he's usually an ass, then he's an ass and deserves a talking to. If he usually cares and remembers, this is a situation you both might apologize for.\n\nQuestion though, are you in therapy for the issues from your childhood?", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s selfish, but how far is it okay for her to ask is the question I\u2019m wondering. Is it okay if she says he should have got her a present if he didn\u2019t get one? Or to throw a party when she gets back? I think expressing disappointment is okay but telling him he should have done something more when he atleast did something at all wasn\u2019t right.\n\nI\u2019d be upset if someone didn\u2019t celebrate my birthday in the way I may have imagined, but I wouldn\u2019t tell them they should have done more because that just seems rude. \n\nAnd again, this is an adult, when you\u2019re grown and matured I think it\u2019s silly to cry that someone didn\u2019t say happy birthday multiple times. It\u2019s not even that he forgot, it\u2019s just he didn\u2019t mention it *enough*", "Sorry that happened. \n\nBut think of this. People you don't know that well thought your  birthday was important enough to be celebrated.  \n\nFocus on that to feel better and pull yourself back out of the painful past. \n\nThen when you are feeling better and stronger, you can deal with the husband then.", "Could be. I am super straight forward with my partner, I used to try to be subtle about things but in the end both of us ended up far more frustrated and confused. Maybe he did think he was doing the right thing, maybe he had something set up for when you got home, maybe he just didn't think about it at all. Definitely a conversation is needed.", "Fair enough. NTA btw, nothing wrong with communicating that to him \n\nHere's an extra Happy birthday \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf82", "During our icebreakers, that was one of the questions we had to answer", "Literally, I'm horrible at dates. I still haven't missed one birthday yet for my boyfriend or my best friend, technology is a blessing.", "According to the post husband did NOT say happy birthday multiple times a day. He said it once, over text, at 1 am. \n\nThat is not enough. That\u2019s how you congrat a friend, not your wife. \n\nThey talked twice on the phone and he didn\u2019t mention the birthday once.", "Just a text Wishing your spouse happy birthday?? No no, that's what one does for an acquaintance. You definitely expect atleast a call from your spouse on your birthday. OP has been reiterating that she hasn't expected gifts/flowers/cake. Just a personal touch. I don't see how that's unreasonable", "True, we don't know if he has something planned for when she gets back, but the problem is the OP appears not to know either. And in a comment OP said husband is often up until 1, so it doesn't seem like he stayed up specially.\n\nA 1 am text and nothing else isn't necessarily an AH move in all circumstances - it sounds like it would work for you! What moves it into AH territory for me is OP's past experiences. While no one has to tiptoe around someone else's trauma, it's a low bar to try to avoid hitting someone's sore spots when you love them and have built a life together. OP is tender about being forgotten and uncelebrated on her birthday; husband should make an effort to make sure she feels celebrated, whether that's asking how her birthday has been going or letting her know he's planning something bigger when she gets home.\n\nI say this as someone who has been TA in this situation: had an elaborate gift and a celebration planned for the week after my partner's birthday. On the day of, the date just didn't signify in my brain and I forgot to wish them happy birthday. I hurt them and I was the asshole, even though I had things planned for later that they knew about. Even though husband wished OP happy birthday once, a single text and no other mention does read as though he forgot once he woke up.", "Thank you!!", "You didn't think this was pertinent to your original post?  Update it please?  I assumed your husband told them.", "I'm garbage at remembering any dates. \n\nSo I now at people's weddings I add their date to their contact info or when I get the invitation.  Now it's on my calendar for ever, same with birthdays. Just add it to their contact.", "I\u2019ll update it, I was a little frazzled when I wrote it so I left a TON out without even thinking about it lol", "Shhh. Who spat in your cereal this morning? The dentist even sends a holiday & birthday card more festive than what her husband did. Maybe go have a nap and ascertain why someone wanting to feel loved by the person that is supposed to love them most in the world that couldn't send more than a digital post-it note for her birthday is somehow bananas. Think dude, lol.", "This person is being really mean. You told your husband you were anxious about this birthday and he knows your past. I too would want my husband to do more than one text. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable at all. You deserved to have him say it on the phone and ask how it\u2019s going etc", "Maybe it's just my reading here, but I am wondering if the 1am text was meant to be thoughtful? Like, he is patiently waiting up until its your birthday to tell you Happy Birthday. Obviously you know your husband best, but I do agree with other comments saying you need to communicate your expectations (yes, regardless of what he should or should not know). Still NTA though.", "Lol this sub is basically overrun with 15 year olds", "I totally get it if I\u2019m the asshole but I\u2019m just trying to explain that I didn\u2019t want some big grand gesture like people are saying. \n\nHe didn\u2019t wait up to tell me happy birthday, he was just still up like he generally is if he doesn\u2019t have to work. My issue was that he just shot me a quick text and that was the end of it. \n\nI tried to communicate it and he just told me that the birthday text was enough, I didn\u2019t agree."]}
