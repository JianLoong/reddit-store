What the fuck is up with these comments? I don't think it's weird that you want your husband to just say \"happy birthday\" once over the phone. Like, a text is nice and sweet but they are also not that personal? And it's not like it's hard???? I usually text people \"Happy Birthday!\" in the morning when it's their birthday even if I'm going to call them later. And when I call them kater the first thing out of my mouth is \"Happy Birthday!\". \n\nLike, I think that is basically all you wanted right, to hear your husband actually say those words using his voice? And for some reasons the comments are acting as if you want him to sing you a fucking concert of birthday song or tell you ever three minutes. \n\nIf he had time to update you on a sports game (which I assume is important to him) he could have had the decent to wish you a happy birthday and ask how your day was", "INFO: did either of you talk about the trip beforehand and how the two you felt about you being away for your birthday?", "NTA your feelings are valid: your needs are not being met. Does your husband know you\u2019re a birthday person? In that case you can give him some ideas next time. It\u2019s difficult for some people to make their partners feel cherished in the way they need to be cherished. \n\nI also want my partner to plan something if it\u2019s a special date. It shows me they care and think of me and know me. Don\u2019t just resign yourself to a birthday text, communicate and hopefully he\u2019ll remember next time.\n\nIt seems like you have nice coworkers however, so not all was bad that day!", "NTA and I don't understand the YTA comments. He sent one text at 1am, correct? That's what I got in the post. He texted and called at other times and didn't say it\u2014so I'm not sure why I'm seeing comments acting as if he said it frequently throughout the day. You got a single 1am text and then he didn't say it over the phone. Yeah, he could've at least said 'hey happy birthday, how's it going' when he called you and no, I don't think that's too much to ask.", "NTA: \nI would hope that he has something planned for you/y\u2019all at home. I may be a bit selfish but I would hope that my SO would at least do Something for me for my birthday in addition to a text. \n\nEven something as simple as him asking if your coworkers were going to be able to celebrate with you in lieu of him would show that he was thinking of you. It\u2019s the small daily moments where it\u2019s nice to be reassured that he cares and that he\u2019s paying attention.\n\nI would hope that if I were in this situation with my SO, he would make an effort to send flowers or something small to my hotel, maybe I\u2019m needy but it\u2019s one day a year and I deserve a bit of extra effort and thought.", "NAH. I think this is an example of having differing love languages and not communicating clearly. You\u2019re expecting him to do something based on what you value and he expects you do accept what he did based on his values. You guys need to sit down and talk about expectations and how to show love and care moving forward. \n\nYou can\u2019t hold your husband responsible for making you feel valued or filling the holes from your childhood. Those are things you need to work through on your own. \n\nYou were a bit dramatic and he was a bit clueless. Happens to all of us at one point or another. Have a conversation and let it go.", "YTA.  You are an adult. He wished you happy birthday once. Get over it.", "NAH, it sounds like you need to communicate and have more reasonable expectations.

He could do more than one text. Maybe call you and ask how your doing, how was your day, I love you. \ud83d\udc80Good God. Anything but one text. \n\nDon\u2019t get down by the Y T As, horrible opinions come early in posts.", "Jezzzzzzus woman.  He said happy birthday.  And you're out of town.  \nAre you fucking nine years old ?  What do you expect?", "NTA. He knows your love language, what hurts you from your past, and things you like.

He could've written you a letter and hid it in your luggage, he could've told you \"happy birthday I'm glad you're in my life/my wife, sent you a loving appreciation text. He also could've sent you flowers, food, a gift to be delivered. So many things to show someone you love them. He knows your trauma and the reassurance you need to know you're loved and he did the absolute bare minimum. Your feelings are valid.", "NTA he did the absolute bare minimum. Literally. He said Happy Birthday once. I understand why your feelings are hurt, sorry.", "NTA, it\u2019s normal to want that from your HUSBAND. One dry text is not enough.

I think the issue is that he planned nothing. Nothing before your trip. Nothing after your trip. Nothing on your trip. The issue isn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have flowers or cake sent to you. The issue is that he showed no desire to take you out to dinner or do something special in the basic timeframe of your birthday.\n\nI\u2019ve travelled on Mother\u2019s Day and my husbands bday. We always makes plans ahead of time so we are both on the same page about when our celebration will be. This way no one feels forgotten.", "NAH; it sounds like you have unresolved trauma and you got triggered when you were onna work trip. Sucks big time. \n\nTriggers happen and you can't always choose how you respond to them. That said, in itself your response was uncalled for. \n\nMy birthday is always a huge trigger, because there was no such thing as a day for me, growing up. Let alone a day to be friendly to me.\n\nI make sure to make a list. I tell my partner: \"I would like one of these gifts, but for me it's more important you take me out for dinner or do something fun with me. Surprises are super stressful, so please don't.\" I'd go as far as saying \"please say a few times that you like doing this activity with me.\"\n\nIt sounds stupid, but people can't guess your triggers, so you should communicate and deal with it. No matter how weird the solution might be.\n\nPlease apologize to your partner and co-workers. Make sure to explain to your partner what caused your response.", "Going against the grain - I think NTA. He had time to update you on a sports game, he could have asked how your birthday was. It costs him nothing! \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had a rough time growing up as well!

There are unresolved issues here on your end. I am the same\u2014I don't need anything big, but I'd just like to feel a little extra special on birthdays. I think this experience you've had should be a conversation starter between you and your boyfriend about gift-giving expectations. You should also communicate how you felt in this instance. Don't accuse him of anything. Simply tell him how you feel. Tell him your needs about gift-giving and birthdays. What will come from it is a better understanding of each other, and who knows\u2014the other commenters might be right in that your boyfriend has a gift when you get home.

Wow.", "It sounds like you have a lot of unresolved trauma regarding your birthday. It probably would be in your best interest to see a therapist if you aren\u2019t already seeing one.

Sorry but a ton of this subreddit thinks adults shouldn't expect anyone to acknowledge your birthday.\n\nIt's fine to celebrate birthdays as an adult, and expect your love language in that regard to be honored.  It's not okay to expect your loved ones to read your mind.  Since you said husband, not BF, I'm assuming dude damn well should know you'd be hurt by a single lazy ass text in the literal middle of the night, followed by stupid groaning about some sportsball game.\n\nI'd be livid in your shoes.  If you want to be grown up about it, have a conversation about it when you've calmed down.  If you want to be petty, spend his birthday prattling on about something he gives no shits about.", "YTA\n\nGet over yourself. You are an adult crying that your husband didn\u2019t say happy birthday *enough*? He texted you all day and called you twice, was that not enough?

What else was he supposed to do \u2026 send a singing telegram to your hotel? You are acting like a spoiled child.", "YTA. He wished you happy birthday, why does he need to do this multiple times?

I\u2019d get being upset if you were around him in person, but if you\u2019re away on a trip he probably didn\u2019t want to interfere with your business trip. I did long distance with my husband for years. On birthdays sometimes all we sent was a text. You should look at what your husband does on a day to day basis versus one day where he\u2019s not even around you to express love or affection. Does he help around the house, show affection, contribute financially, communicate well? That\u2019s far more important than this. I get that birthdays can be really important, but it\u2019s hard to make them important when you aren\u2019t in person with someone.", "YTA. What else did you expect from him?

For all you know he could have planned something for when you got home, but now that\u2019s soured by your guilt trip.", "YTA but I am sorry you feel hurt by this. There are a million ways to feel cared for that don\u2019t involve birthdays, but you should never rely on anyone else to make you feel important. It\u2019s a nice bonus when they do, but low self esteem in a partner is exhausting. A birthday is one day. What matters is the other 364 days-do you feel loved and cared for at other times? Is this the worst thing he\u2019s done? \nLet it go. It\u2019s a small slight in a lifetime.", "You are an adult. Did you call your mother? Did you thank her for giving birth to you? Did you even acknowledge the pain and struggle she went through giving birth and raising you? \n\nYeah, probably not.", "Sorry but YTA - look, you had limited time to talk today but he still wished you happy birthday. Maybe you could said something more like \u201cwhen I get back let\u2019s do something/ I\u2019m excited to do something for my birthday when I get back\u201d instead of being upset at him.\n\nAnd I get the coworker thing but it\u2019s kind of a bad comparison imo. You\u2019re coworkers probably want to maintain a good relationship with you, whilst your husband will be there when you get home with maybe a gift or two/your favourite meal. \n\nYou can ask for more here, but for today there were limits. Also Happy Birthday!!", "YTA. I know that this comes from a place of trauma, but he can\u2019t read your mind. You can tell him all about your trauma, and he can acknowledge it but he won\u2019t know how to fix it. Its unfair to expect him to fix your trauma for you. \n\nAnyway, if you had communicated with him that you wanted him to do something special for your birthday, I think he would have gone above and beyond for you because he loves you. And men are kinda dense tbh, you have to clearly communicate things to them so they reciprocate. \n\nIf it is trauma like I\u2019ve suspected, I would recommend you speaking to a therapist who can help you with healthy coping mechanisms and setting healthy boundaries.

I just wanted him to call to say happy birthday (both times we talked, I called him) or ask how it was going. It kinda just felt like he remembered last night but didn\u2019t remember when he woke up.", "I appreciate the list idea!! I will definitely start doing that, and I\u2019m working on better communicating expectations. \n\nAlso HUGE note: I didn\u2019t cry in front of my co-workers, I was in my hotel room. Sorry, I know my post didn\u2019t have enough info", "I just felt like, for your spouses\u2019 birthday, you should do more than send a text. If he had mentioned it on the phone or asked how it was going, I would\u2019ve been happy.", "No, no, no.  Everytime he texted her or talked to her.  I might be cynical...no wait, I really am, but if someone said happy birthday to me more than once, I'd think they had a memory problem.", "Reminds me of an ex that expected me to tell her happy birthday every day, multiple times a day, for a week. \n\nOP seems to think her husband should have been talking about it all day. Even though they weren't even in the same city and weren't going to see each other all day.", "Yes, how hard would that be?", "He\u2019s my husband, and he knows my expectations/issues around birthdays (I don\u2019t expect presents but I just need to know that he cares)", "\"Husband, please tell me happy birthday with your voice on my birthday\"", "Yes! Great point. If you want big birthdays, you have to communicate that! Boyfriend can't read your mind.", "Why not door dash a cake for the person you married? That\u2019s actually a really thoughtful gesture.", "My husband and friends have always sent something to my hotel room when I\u2019ve been away for special occasions- champagne, flowers, food, etc.  It\u2019s not that hard.\n\nHusband and I were recently away for our big birthdays.  Friends sent Prosecco and chocolate desserts to our room.\n\nNot that hard.", "Actually, Doordashing a cake would have been a good idea.", "So my issue was that he texted me once at 1AM, then never mentioned it the next day. I called him both times we spoke on the phone, but I don\u2019t fault him for that because I had a busy day. It felt like he forgot when he woke up, which is a soft spot for me.", "Please, with the \"this cannot be real\" comments. Yes OP is being ridiculous but if this honestly shocks you, you have a narrow view of humanity.", "Spouses DO see how important things are. I'm sorry you married an AH. :(", "Same. I totally agree and it bums me out too when my husband doesn\u2019t come through for me on my birthday the way I\u2019d like him to. I feel bad she\u2019s getting so many YTA votes.", "During \u201cicebreakers,\u201d one of the questions was about cake flavors", ">How many times does he have to say it??\n\nOnce would have probably been nice.", "I didn\u2019t expect presents/surprises/etc. \n\nI expected him to maybe say it while we were on the phone or ask how it was", "I didn\u2019t want a card or cake, I just wanted him to say it while we were on the phone or ask how it was going. I just wanted more than a quick text", "I\u2019ve definitely been a little confused about the comments saying I should tell him what I expect on my birthday - we\u2019re married, he definitely knows what I expect on my birthday. \n\nLike I didn\u2019t expect a present or anything like that, as juvenile as it sounds I just expected my birthday to get more thought-time than steph curry\u2019s shoulder", "I mean a text is pretty impersonal. Maybe he could've said it on the phone and asked her about her birthday, given her some extra attention and thought. Personally if my partner was going to be away for their birthday I would sneak a gift into their bag to open on the day. Little thoughtful things mean a lot to some people. And OP mentioned that her partner knows about her history of feeling unloved. \n\n\n>Be grateful he remembered your birthday to begin with\n\n\nThis is the bare minimum, man. I dont think its the biggest issue in the world, but OP is certainly entitled to feel disappointed.", "*taking notes for my husband*", "I think she\u2019s being overdramatic but it would have been nice to ask her how her birthday was going or if she did anything for it with her coworkers", "God, you sound miserable. Other people are allowed to have expectations and standards of being treated \ud83d\ude02", "Happy early birthday!!", "You didn\u2019t answer the question, did you communicate with your husband about how you specifically wanted your birthday handled with you being out of town?", "It\u2019s weird, some people want their spouse to act like they give a shit", "How hard would it be to ask if she\u2019s having a nice day when they talk on the phone, or say \u2018are you enjoying your birthday?\u2019 - ONE text at 1am is the absolute minimum possible effort that could be made on a day he knows is meaningful to his wife.", "He didn\u2019t say it. He texted it - literally the least effort possible. \n\nAnd not everyone reads texts immediately. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much more effort to ask someone you love how their birthday has gone - especially if your other topics are updating them on a sports game \n\nThese answers baffle me. If you care about someone you acknowledge their important moments - in a meaningful way. Case closed.", "He isn\u2019t required to, but she isn\u2019t required to be happy about it.", "I know you\u2019re getting a lot of response saying YTA, but I want you to know - as an adult who absolutely LOVES celebrating birthdays - I totally understand where you\u2019re coming from. My husband has dropped the ball on my birthday multiple times and I really hurts, especially as he knows how important it is to me. Make sure you communicate how he made you feel, in a calm and reasonable way, and he should be more than willing to make it up to you in the future. If he really cares about you, giving you extra attention and telling you happy birthday throughout the day, as well as a gift, card and nice dinner are all easy things for him to do. People are really different though. My husband had never cared about celebrating his birthday prior to meeting me, so I just needed to communicate to him how important it was for me in order for him to get it. Anyway, happy birthday! And I hope next year is better for you.", "You're being gracious because really he could have sent some ubereats to your door too.", "Were you even interested in the outcome of the warrior's game?", "That's great, most likely no permanent damage done in that case. Good luck!", "Although I vote NTA, I think you have deep unresolved childhood trauma that you should see a therapist about. I think it could be beneficial to your relationship. \n\n(I have the same issues around birthdays except I expect nothing so I never get my hopes crushed. Therapy helped me a lot.)", "Right. If you have to beg someone to give zero effort, you shouldn't be with that person.", "Nobody I\u2019ve ever met has ever done this so while it might be common in your circle it might not be seen as something not hard to do for others. We just say happy birthday and celebrate when they\u2019re back.", "I mean, yeah, but OP clarifies in a comment she wanted him to say it again and was upset it was only the once.", "This is where I think the trauma is coming in. It\u2019s not very logical that he would have remembered it was your birthday, texted, and then forgotten it was your birthday only a few hours later, right? Trauma and anxiety aren\u2019t logical so I hear you, but I don\u2019t know if it makes him an AH.", "Is he usually up until 1AM?", " \" found out my favorite flavor of cake, and surprised me with it at dinner.\" If you don't them then why were you shocked that they \"found out\". \n\nJust sayin..... it's weird that you keep saying that he \"didn't mention your birthday\" but also said that he sent you a happy birthday text.", "This is a hard one, dont really think YTA as I would think he should be giving you more enthusiasm for your bday, however, comparing him to your coworkers isnt fair as you are physically present with them and not him so its easier for them to do more for you in that environment. He should still have done more though imo.", "Maybe a strip-o-gram would be fun. \ud83e\udd23", "Fair point.", "Sorry- I read your original question as asking if we talked about how I felt about me being away on my birthday. \n\nI didn\u2019t give any specifics on gifts/surprises or anything like that, but I didn\u2019t expect anything like that either", "Right!?!", "He didn't \"say\" it. He texted it at 1am. I don't think it's much to expect him to say it over they're on the phone or even inquire how her day is going.", "When he doesn\u2019t have to work the next day (this was the case last night), yes", "I was shocked that they got together and signed the card without me knowing. It didn\u2019t even occur to me that they planned ahead and used the icebreakers to figure out my favorite flavor of cake. \n\nI meant that he never mentioned it the next day (texted before he went to sleep, the \u201cnever mentioned\u201d is about after he woke up)", "So why are you upset? He talked to you multiple times and told you happy birthday. Adults don\u2019t get the king/queen treatment on birthdays, it\u2019s just another day. Sounds like you need therapy for your childhood issues.", "I didn\u2019t want royalty treatment, I just wanted more than an impersonal birthday text", "Right, should he have written you a poem, or maybe a romantic story? Would that have made you feel more special? Jesus Christ man.\n\nHe told you happy birthday. I assume he put an exclamation mark or two? That\u2019s what you get on your birthday when you\u2019re out of town. He didn\u2019t ignore you, he didn\u2019t purposefully separate himself from you, you went on a business trip over your birthday and he acted appropriately. You\u2019re blowing this wayyyyyy out of proportion.", "Dude no I just wanted the man I married to do more than send a quick text. I totally get if I\u2019m the asshole for wanting him to say it on the phone or anything like that but I didn\u2019t expect him to go crazy, I just wanted my birthday to get more attention in his mind than steph curry\u2019s shoulder", "Sorry OP. This sub is full of adult bullies that try to make people feel like shit. It\u2019s kind of hilariously sad how much people enjoy being assholes while calling people assholes.", "We\u2019re going in circles. I\u2019m my eyes you\u2019re being unreasonable and looking for a way to ruin your own birthday. Sounds like he did a super cute thing of waiting up until it was your birthday to tell you and assumed he had done his part. Now you\u2019re upset because his gesture wasn\u2019t enough for you and rather than communicate with him you\u2019ve run to Reddit looking to be vindicated. \n\nSorry you\u2019re not having a good birthday but YTA here.", "Crazy how when you open up your issues to the internet some people may disagree with you."]}
