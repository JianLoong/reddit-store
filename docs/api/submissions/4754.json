I'm on a business trip, so I have to spend it with coworkers instead of family.\nMy husband texted me at 1AM and told me happy birthday. I had a busy schedule today, but we talked on the phone twice and texted throughout\nthe day. I kept thinking he would say something, but he never did. He never said happy birthday again, never even mentioned that it was my\nbirthday. My coworkers somehow got together and signed a card without me knowing, found out my favorite flavor of cake (*edit: they found out by using it as one of the \u201cicebreaker\u201d questions), and surprised me with it at dinner.\n\nI told my husband that I was hurt that he didn't mention anything about my birthday. He said that we barely talked today, and he had already told\nme happy birthday. During our second phone call of the day, he had time to update me on the Warriors game but I guess he didn't have time to\ntell me happy birthday. I've spent the last hour crying. My coworkers, who I just officially met two days ago (I work from home), put more thought into my birthday than my husband did. I'm heartbroken, he thinks that he did nothing wrong. I don't know if I'm just entitled to expect more. \n\nI told him he should\u2019ve done more than send one text. I didn\u2019t have the best family growing up, and I never felt like I mattered to anyone. My husband knows this, and he knows that feeling like someone cares about me is important to me. He thinks that, since he told me happy birthday, that shows that he cares. I feel like you should be able to expect more from your spouse than a birthday text. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n\n*Edit because I\u2019m not sure how to respond to a question, and I can\u2019t see comments yet: \n\n\u2022Did you know you were going out of town? \n    -We both knew I was going out of town. \n\n\u2022 What did you expect from him? \n    -I didn\u2019t expect presents/plans or anything like that. When we spoke today, he never mentioned my birthday or asked how it was going. I honestly think he remembered it last night but didn\u2019t think about it/forgot after waking up today. I know it\u2019s dumb but the only thing I expect was for him to mention it at some point today, like say happy birthday while we\u2019re on the phone or ask how it\u2019s going instead of sending a quick text and going on about his day. I always make a big deal for his birthday (even when we can\u2019t spend it together) so I just kinda expected more than a text.\n\n*Another Edit just to clear up a common question:\nHe knows how I feel about birthdays and that I just want to feel acknowledged/appreciated. We\u2019ve previously celebrated birthdays while separated, and this was never an issue before. This is an expectation that has been communicated, I don\u2019t expect him to read my mind. He also does not have plans for when I come home.", "created_utc": 1671076247, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmbc6s/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_shouldve_done_more/", "score": 934, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What the fuck is up with these comments? I don't think it's weird that you want your husband to just say \"happy birthday\" once over the phone. Like, a text is nice and sweet but they are also not that personal? And it's not like it's hard???? I usually text people \"Happy Birthday!\" in the morning when it's their birthday even if I'm going to call them later. And when I call them kater the first thing out of my mouth is \"Happy Birthday!\". \n\nLike, I think that is basically all you wanted right, to hear your husband actually say those words using his voice? And for some reasons the comments are acting as if you want him to sing you a fucking concert of birthday song or tell you ever three minutes. \n\nIf he had time to update you on a sports game (which I assume is important to him) he could have had the decent to wish you a happy birthday and ask how your day was", "INFO: did either of you talk about the trip beforehand and how the two you felt about you being away for your birthday?", "NTA your feelings are valid: your needs are not being met. Does your husband know you\u2019re a birthday person? In that case you can give him some ideas next time. It\u2019s difficult for some people to make their partners feel cherished in the way they need to be cherished. \n\nI also want my partner to plan something if it\u2019s a special date. It shows me they care and think of me and know me. Don\u2019t just resign yourself to a birthday text, communicate and hopefully he\u2019ll remember next time.\n\nIt seems like you have nice coworkers however, so not all was bad that day!", "NTA and I don't understand the YTA comments. He sent one text at 1am, correct? That's what I got in the post. He texted and called at other times and didn't say it\u2014so I'm not sure why I'm seeing comments acting as if he said it frequently throughout the day. You got a single 1am text and then he didn't say it over the phone. Yeah, he could've at least said 'hey happy birthday, how's it going' when he called you and no, I don't think that's too much to ask.", "NTA: \nI would hope that he has something planned for you/y\u2019all at home. I may be a bit selfish but I would hope that my SO would at least do Something for me for my birthday in addition to a text. \n\nEven something as simple as him asking if your coworkers were going to be able to celebrate with you in lieu of him would show that he was thinking of you. It\u2019s the small daily moments where it\u2019s nice to be reassured that he cares and that he\u2019s paying attention.\n\nI would hope that if I were in this situation with my SO, he would make an effort to send flowers or something small to my hotel, maybe I\u2019m needy but it\u2019s one day a year and I deserve a bit of extra effort and thought.", "NAH. I think this is an example of having differing love languages and not communicating clearly. You\u2019re expecting him to do something based on what you value and he expects you do accept what he did based on his values. You guys need to sit down and talk about expectations and how to show love and care moving forward. \n\nYou can\u2019t hold your husband responsible for making you feel valued or filling the holes from your childhood. Those are things you need to work through on your own. \n\nYou were a bit dramatic and he was a bit clueless. Happens to all of us at one point or another. Have a conversation and let it go.", "YTA.  You are an adult. He wished you happy birthday once. Get over it.", "NAH, it sounds like you need to communicate and have more reasonable expectations. I don\u2019t necessarily think you are an asshole given your history, but I don\u2019t think you are being fair either.", "Nta\n\nAnd I'm shocked people are making you explain why you wanted someone to spend a little time talking about your day on your birthday.", "NTA. He could do more than one text. Maybe call you and ask how your doing, how was your day, I love you. \ud83d\udc80Good God. Anything but one text. \n\nDon\u2019t get down by the Y T As, horrible opinions come early in posts.", "[deleted]", "NTA. He knows your love language, what hurts you from your past, and things you like. There's so many small gestures he could've done that cost him absolutely nothing.

He knows your trauma and the reassurance you need to know you're loved and he did the absolute bare minimum. Your feelings are valid.", "NTA he did the absolute bare minimum. Literally. He said Happy Birthday once. I understand why your feelings are hurt, sorry.", "NTA, it\u2019s normal to want that from your HUSBAND. One dry text is not enough.

I think the issue is that he planned nothing. Nothing before your trip. Nothing after your trip. Nothing on your trip. The issue isn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have flowers or cake sent to you. The issue is that he showed no desire to take you out to dinner or do something special in the basic timeframe of your birthday.\n\nI\u2019ve travelled on Mother\u2019s Day and my husbands bday. We always makes plans ahead of time so we are both on the same page about when our celebration will be. This way no one feels forgotten.", "NAH; it sounds like you have unresolved trauma and you got triggered when you were onna work trip. Sucks big time. \n\nTriggers happen and you can't always choose how you respond to them. That said, in itself your response was uncalled for. \n\nMy birthday is always a huge trigger, because there was no such thing as a day for me, growing up. Let alone a day to be friendly to me.\n\nI make sure to make a list. I tell my partner: \"I would like one of these gifts, but for me it's more important you take me out for dinner or do something fun with me. Surprises are super stressful, so please don't.\" I'd go as far as saying \"please say a few times that you like doing this activity with me.\"\n\nIt sounds stupid, but people can't guess your triggers, so you should communicate and deal with it. No matter how weird the solution might be.\n\nPlease apologize to your partner and co-workers. Make sure to explain to your partner what caused your response.", "Going against the grain - I think NTA. He had time to update you on a sports game, he could have asked how your birthday was. It costs him nothing! \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had a rough time growing up as well!

There are unresolved issues here on your end. I am the same\u2014I don't need anything big, but I'd just like to feel a little extra special on birthdays. I think this experience you've had should be a conversation starter between you and your boyfriend about gift-giving expectations. You should also communicate how you felt in this instance. Don't accuse him of anything. Simply tell him how you feel. Tell him your needs about gift-giving and birthdays.

Sorry but a ton of this subreddit thinks adults shouldn't expect anyone to acknowledge your birthday.\n\nIt's fine to celebrate birthdays as an adult, and expect your love language in that regard to be honored.  It's not okay to expect your loved ones to read your mind.  Since you said husband, not BF, I'm assuming dude damn well should know you'd be hurt by a single lazy ass text in the literal middle of the night, followed by stupid groaning about some sportsball game.\n\nI'd be livid in your shoes.  If you want to be grown up about it, have a conversation about it when you've calmed down.  If you want to be petty, spend his birthday prattling on about something he gives no shits about.", "YTA\n\nGet over yourself. You are an adult crying that your husband didn\u2019t say happy birthday *enough*? He texted you all day and called you twice, was that not enough?

What else was he supposed to do \u2026 send a singing telegram to your hotel? You are acting like a spoiled child.", "YTA. He wished you happy birthday, why does he need to do this multiple times?

I\u2019d get being upset if you were around him in person, but if you\u2019re away on a trip he probably didn\u2019t want to interfere with your business trip. I did long distance with my husband for years. On birthdays sometimes all we sent was a text. You should look at what your husband does on a day to day basis versus one day where he\u2019s not even around you to express love or affection. Does he help around the house, show affection, contribute financially, communicate well? That\u2019s far more important than this.

There are a million ways to feel cared for that don\u2019t involve birthdays, but you should never rely on anyone else to make you feel important. It\u2019s a nice bonus when they do, but low self esteem in a partner is exhausting. A birthday is one day. What matters is the other 364 days-do you feel loved and cared for at other times? Is this the worst thing he\u2019s done? \nLet it go. It\u2019s a small slight in a lifetime.", "You are an adult. Did you call your mother? Did you thank her for giving birth to you? Did you even acknowledge the pain and struggle she went through giving birth and raising you? \n\nYeah, probably not.", "Sorry but YTA - look, you had limited time to talk today but he still wished you happy birthday. Maybe you could said something more like \u201cwhen I get back let\u2019s do something/ I\u2019m excited to do something for my birthday when I get back\u201d instead of being upset at him.\n\nAnd I get the coworker thing but it\u2019s kind of a bad comparison imo. You\u2019re coworkers probably want to maintain a good relationship with you, whilst your husband will be there when you get home with maybe a gift or two/your favourite meal. \n\nYou can ask for more here, but for today there were limits. Also Happy Birthday!!", "YTA. I know that this comes from a place of trauma, but he can\u2019t read your mind. You can tell him all about your trauma, and he can acknowledge it but he won\u2019t know how to fix it. Its unfair to expect him to fix your trauma for you. \n\nAnyway, if you had communicated with him that you wanted him to do something special for your birthday, I think he would have gone above and beyond for you because he loves you. And men are kinda dense tbh, you have to clearly communicate things to them so they reciprocate. \n\nIf it is trauma like I\u2019ve suspected, I would recommend you speaking to a therapist who can help you with healthy coping mechanisms and setting healthy boundaries.

I feel like you are just asking him to say it on the call. It's not that hard to say \"Happy birthday, love. How is your birthday going?\" I don't get why people are acting like it's too much to ask for. My friends and I always text each other happy birthday wishes when we wake up or go to bed (we all live in different timezones). And then when we have a chance to speak, we also say happy birthday and find out all about birthday activities.

I used to stay up and wait until the next day to be the first person to say happy birthday to someone I cared about (sometimes I would lose track of time and I would end up messaging them a 1 am too) and not really say anything about it the rest of day so that could be an indication that he did actually put in effort to say happy birthday to her.\n\nBirthdays are just another day for my partner and I personally but it\u2019s the time we set apart to celebrate it that makes it special because we\u2019d rather express affection in person.

Sorry it didn't go as desired.\n\nAnyway... If you two knew how busy you were going to be, he likely sent the happy birthday in case you all didn't get a chance to talk. Not bringing it up later might just be because he is the type to think that saying something once is the correct number of times to say it. I *think* this probably falls to different communication styles. If that's true, NAH. But you would both need to work on a better way to communicate. Like, he says happy birthday over the phone instead of text, you let him know that you want him to ask about your day in these situations, etc. There are some people who don't like to talk about their workday while it is happening. I don't, so my wife will talk about a sports ball game to keep my mind off of it. I know nothing about sports. Still helps, oddly enough.\n\nI have to ask though: does he actually not care about your feelings? Does he usually forget about things that are important to you? Or are only feeling that way because you are upset? If he's usually an ass, then he's an ass and deserves a talking to. If he usually cares and remembers, this is a situation you both might apologize for.\n\nQuestion though, are you in therapy for the issues from your childhood?", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s selfish, but how far is it okay for her to ask is the question I\u2019m wondering. Is it okay if she says he should have got her a present if he didn\u2019t get one? Or to throw a party when she gets back? I think expressing disappointment is okay but telling him he should have done something more when he atleast did something at all wasn\u2019t right.\n\nI\u2019d be upset if someone didn\u2019t celebrate my birthday in the way I may have imagined, but I wouldn\u2019t tell them they should have done more because that just seems rude. \n\nAnd again, this is an adult, when you\u2019re grown and matured I think it\u2019s silly to cry that someone didn\u2019t say happy birthday multiple times.

I am super straight forward with my partner, I used to try to be subtle about things but in the end both of us ended up far more frustrated and confused.

What moves it into AH territory for me is OP's past experiences. While no one has to tiptoe around someone else's trauma, it's a low bar to try to avoid hitting someone's sore spots when you love them and have built a life together. OP is tender about being forgotten and uncelebrated on her birthday; husband should make an effort to make sure she feels celebrated, whether that's asking how her birthday has been going or letting her know he's planning something bigger when she gets home.\n\nI say this as someone who has been TA in this situation: had an elaborate gift and a celebration planned for the week after my partner's birthday.

He\u2019s probably thinking I literally wished her happy birthday the very first hour of the day, and we were in touch all day, even though she was on a business trip. I have absolutely showed her throughout the day that I\u2019m thinking about her. She needs to know she is cared about? Check. \n\nI feel like your needs are somewhat specific (needing him to specifically mention your birthday more than once, vs just being in touch). They aren\u2019t wrong or unreasonable by any means, but they may also not be obvious to anyone/everyone (I don\u2019t think they would be obvious to me, for example). In comments you seem to suggest that of course he knows what you need because you are married, but marriage doesn\u2019t grant secret entrance to some sort of mind reading ability. \n\nI do believe in love languages. Someone in the comments was really dismissive, and I think they can get overused, or used incorrectly. But I do think it\u2019s a helpful way to understand that not everyone expresses love well in all ways. If your husband is not expressing love well in any way, that\u2019s a problem. But if he is showing you he loves you in other ways, and it\u2019s not like he forgot your birthday, he just got a D grade on birthday, maybe let it go. \n\nIn the first few years of dating my husband, I was really hurt that he didn\u2019t do birthdays, or really any gifts/occasions well. And it was easy to say to myself: \u201cI would think if he really loves me, he would\u2026\u201d. Or, as you said, \u201cI feel like you should be able to expect\u2026\u201d. And I\u2019d let myself get hurt and disappointed every birthday and Valentine\u2019s Day. But at some point I stopped and asked myself: do you actually have any question whether he loves you?  In my case, the answer was no, I had no doubt. It\u2019s not like my now husband was some sort of deadbeat on the love front. This guy used words to tell me he loves me, he\u2019d randomly come up behind me and rub my shoulders, he cooked meals for me, we laugh together, he respects my intelligence, and now that we have kids he lifts way more than his weight in the parenting department. So in the big scheme of things, why turn gift giving occasions into a source of stress? So sometimes I let it go, sometimes I make plans, and sometimes I give him really specific instructions. But I no longer wait to see what he\u2019ll do if I know there is a chance that I will get hurt.  I think maybe you should treat birthdays the same way.", "As someone that hates birthdays being mentioned I'll say that YTA. People aren't mind readers.

But YOU don't have to stay in a relationship where you have to suck up the things that you want, the idea of a relationship that really makes you happy. You don't have to live a life where you're in a battle between sucking it up because of \"different love languages\" and thinking about how so many people have the relationship dynamic that you dream of but you don't. Yes, I am very much projecting, as this could just be a one off incident and not a reflection of your whole relationship, lol.\n\nNo, I'm not saying to dump him. I'm urging you to seek what you dream of in a relationship, and don't settle. Relationships where people put the extra effort into your birthday ARE OUT THERE. Relationships where people try their hardest to heal your inner child are out there! They are! Your husband isn't responsible for your childhood but there are people who will put in the extra effort to try to fill that hole out of nothing but love for you. I'm not saying to divorce him, I'm saying to seek what you want. The reason that me and my girlfriend are still together is because she agreed to contribute more to that kinda thing. Obviously have a good conversation about this because there IS such a thing as asking for too much but idk what y'all look like at home so like yea.

How could you expect someone to remember  when an important date is like that, you're just assuming that they can even do that??? They might have a brain injury or a mental illness that makes it hard for them to even know what day of the week it is and you think they should have to remember a BIRTHDAY? Maybe they have a physical disability that makes it hard for them to use calendars, or they just don't have the energy. If you ACTUALLY cared about them you wouldn't be so selfish. /s\n\n\n\n\n2- Excuse you, like it's not emotional labor to care about her birthday at all? He's supposed to remember it on his own, and take time out of his day to wish her a happy birthday, act like it's a big deal and go out of his way to make her feel special, when he isn't getting anything out of it, and he has to do that EVERY YEAR. /s\n\n\n\n\n3- God, right?! It's SO exhausting to remind someone about an important date, do they even care about how taxing it is on your mental and emotional energy to point out that an event is coming up? You have to remember the thing you want them to remember yourself, open your mouth, use it AND your tongue AND your lips AND YOUR VOCAL CORDS, plus the language center of your brain, you have to form a FULL SENTENCE  and say it, out loud, specifically where THEY can hear it... /s\n\n\n\nReminding someone that a birthday is coming up or whatever is not \"doing all the emotional labor of the whole family\". If you have to do it  for every event on the family calander and no one else bothers to even try despite being perfectly capable of remembering themselves, because they expect you to be the one who just Takes Care Of That, THEN, yeah, that's an issue. But otherwise? Seriously not a big deal.\n\n\n(An edit for clarification: Emotional labor is absolutely a thing, I just think this was a case of shoving a buzzword in where it doesn't belong in a way that makes the concept come off as stupid and juvenile, which really grinds my gears because that makes it more difficult to get an idea taken seriously by the general public. I threw out more absurd examples of using real issues, like ableism, in the same way to make my point.)", "But, we don't know that he didn't ask her how things were going?

Because, \"so sorry babe, I'll do better babe\" quickly turns into \"get off my effing back already\" when he's reminded by what an AH he is but doesn't want to face.\n\nAs is said here, it's not about the Iranian yogurt.", "Honestly, I'll praise you for even remembering what he said about the game (yes I'm assuming you don't care about sports, at the very least this game was about his interest) if someone says something about a game/player I can guarantee I will forget it entirely within the hour.", "What if he was planning a surprise? But genuinely what could he have done when they are not in the same location right now?", "is that because you're age (and expected relative maturity) would change the ruling?", "She was out of the house on her birthday. He had extra time to decorate the house for a lovely happy birthday/welcome home greeting. He could have put up a banner, buy flowers, do something to show he thought of her birthday. This isn't a lot of effort for someone you care about on their birthday. \n\nOP's husband directly hit one of her childhood wounds that she told him about. She's also previously told him how to make her feel loved. To me, this reads he doesn't care about her feelings.", "You should mark this comment with /s so people know it is sarcasm and don\u2019t accidentally think you are being serious.", "I don\u2019t understand how you can think he asked how her birthday was going when he didn\u2019t mention her birthday.", "Mean surprise if it makes the OP feel this way, but I think any surprises that hinge on making the surprisee (probably not a real word) feel miserable first is just cruel. \n\nTbh the main thing day of would just be to acknowledge it more on the actual call, how's her birthday going etc.", "Tell her happy birthday, tell her what he loves about her, and ask her how her day is lol. It\u2019s so simple", "In this age of technology, there\u2019s so many things. My partner and I couldn\u2019t be together on my birthday yet he sent me instacart/Uber eats, flowers, a Starbucks e-gift card, etc through out the day. Not only him but a few of my friends sent me Starbucks thru iMessage. And yes, my partner had planned a whole trip/huge gift afterwards. afterwards. You do not have to be in the same location to celebrate someone. Even something as quick as a happy birthday call goes far.", "I don\u2019t think my age would change anything (I\u2019ve been married for two years so I think it\u2019s clear I\u2019m not a minor or anything like that) it\u2019s just something I\u2019m not comfortable sharing online", "What age would change the ruling? She is married, her husband made no effort. What bit of that would change?", "I know, and he did nothing except send a text at 1am. I'd be really upset too, and I don't have the childhood wounds that OP has. I feel so awful for her.", "Did you read in her comments that he usually does celebrate her birthday. Not a good sign if this behavior is not standard.", "Her husband did tell her happy birthday, though? I can feel her pains and I can't scold her for feeling neglected. But, she did say he texted her greetings upon the day?", "You're right, good call. I'll go back and add that.", "That\u2019s so cute", "I guess this is just a good example of how different everyone is cause for me the happy birthday text would suffice but as someone said in the comments, they really need to communicate more on stuff like this", "Thy are probably looking to see if there is an age gap so they can jump on that for no apparent reason. Some people on here really hate people of different ages getting together.", "She got a text at 1am. He didn't acknowledge it again or even message her telling her he hoped she had a good day.", "Definitely glad you added the notation. I was like \u201cwuuuut?\u201d", "But at least one of the new colleagues bothered to remember it and make an effort to get it, whereas OP has told husband before that being celebrated on her birthday is important and he doesn't seem to have filed that information away.", "Yeah I\u2019m not sure why it would be something that\u2019s relevant, to be honest. If that\u2019s the route they\u2019re taking, we were born in the same year so there\u2019s not much wiggle room there lol"]}
