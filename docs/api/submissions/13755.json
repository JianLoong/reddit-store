Other states though, turning right on red is completely illegal. Parallel parking procedure is pretty standard amongst all of the states, but, despite that, usually we deal with people here that don't know how to do it because parallel parking locations are only usually found in certain parts of the country, most commonly in the Northeastern states, or in major tourism towns/cities in other states such as Orlando, FL.\n\n That being said, hopefully you just don't have this situation happen again.

Once you realized she was in fact trying to park there and she was there first (she passed the spot before you so she could reverse in,  as is normal), you should have let her take the spot. The kid has nothing to do with it though and although I would have given her the spot, her bringing up her kid would definitely have irritated me.", "Ummm no, I was literally there first. Thanks for your opinion!", "It's really hard to say. I just did some research and it seems like some cars have only 1 reverse light. If the light was dull or burnt out, or due to this event being during the day, it could be that the light was hard to see or unseeable at all. If it was a case of the latter, due to being burnt out, then I wonder if the turn signal was actually burnt out as well and it was a wasted opportunity to let the woman know. \n\nEven so, though, I still feel that there should've been enough context clues to realize what was going on.

Apparently she was going to make a u turn on a busy avenue and somehow I was supposed to know this. It is not our job to mindread other drivers when they don't follow the rules. She had no right to the spot. The fact that she had her kid with her changes nothing. What if there were no spots when she arrived? The child can walk, or if a baby she can carry them or bring a folding stroller.
