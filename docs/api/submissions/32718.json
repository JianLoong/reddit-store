The remainder of the staff should not be subjected to him blocking and abandoning their toilet and being forced to clean it themselves if they wish to use it first.\n\nIt seems a pretty simple rule - you block it, you clean it. Yes, most workplaces normally have a cleaner who deals with this sort of thing, but an exception is normally granted when it is one particular person who has caused the trouble and should clean it themselves, not pass it off to an innocent cleaner. Their job description is cleaning, not unblocking toilets...\n\nIs this guy by any chance the sort of person who just dumps his coffee cup in the sink and expects someone else to have done the washing up and cleaned it for him?\n\nThe fact that he is continually blocking toilets does make me consider a couple of things:\nThat the plumbing is not up to standard and there are unknown problems with it causing it to get easily blocked - perhaps something worth getting a plumber up check out.\nAlternatively, he had something up with his diet and body that is causing him to need multiple toilet destroying large shits every day, and he needs to either reconsider his diet (is he perhaps a weight lifter/protein shake bro?)

Not sure why he has to take a crap at work everyday, but he should probably look at his diet, seems questionable.\n\nThere may be an option that he uses a waste basket to throw his toilet paper in instead of the toilet.
