We started dating 3 years ago and the honey moon phase started to slowly dwindle. At this point, Stella only came over to my place for either sex or to have something. We even told each-other that our relationship has gotten stale, but we wanted to make it work. Well, one night I ended up masturbating with a girl through Discord, then we hooked up the week after. This destroyed me and I was full of guilt, so I told Stella and we broke up. Now almost ALL of our mutual friends hate me and take Stella's side for everything. The only one who stood by me was Rich (23m) my best friend. He helped me through my breakup, encouraged me to get through therapy, and has heard me out. But the more I ended up getting frustrated with Stella trying to alienate me from our friends, the more I ranted to Rich about it, calling her names in emotion. But Rich would always go \"well you DID cheat on her\" or \"well you DID do this or that\" and it's really annoying. I KNOW I fucked up, I feel so guilty, but I don't need to be reminded of it every time. To have my entire being reduced to solely a moment. Now Rich is a shy guy, he had a girlfriend but she dumped him because she found him too anti-social and uninteresting. His love life is non-existent. So one time when he tried defending Stella, I told him straight up, \"you know you can't even talk about girls when you can't even keep one for your life\" or something like that. I was REALLY angry, and Rich called me an \"absolute dick\" and said he won't talk to me until I apologize.\n\nNow I feel like I fucked up, but also I'm frustrated when all I am to people including him as the \"cheating man\" and like I don't have any other qualities.", "created_utc": 1670586624, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgv8lb/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_that_he_cant_keep/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s a fact. And that won\u2019t change no matter how you want to spin it. Let it go, let her go, stop talking about her and you won\u2019t be reminded that you are a cheater.\n\nWhat you said to him was an absolute AH move.", "YTA. What you said was so wrong. What Rich is saying is the truth. You cheated on Stella so what do you expect? Also calling her names is very wrong as well. \n\nRich even sounds like a great friend by trying to support you through it rather than just alienate you like your other friends. Yet you don't even show some appreciation but offend him.", "YTA.  You cheated on your girlfriend and you won\u2019t shut up about it to your one loyal friend. And then you attack him because he won\u2019t just let you talk bad about her. You\u2019re such an asshole.", "YTA.  If you're the one ranting about your ex-girlfriend who is avoiding you for cheating, how do you expect him to respond?  Silence?  Agreement?  The first one is extremely difficult and the second is quite simply out of the question.", "YTA\n\nApologise to your friend. You made a bad mistake and should have broken up with the girl sooner but you need to accept that it\u2019s happened and move on. Get back on the dating scene and try again. You can\u2019t complain to your friend about what\u2019s happened and then be upset when he hits you with the truth! \n\nYou DID cheat. YOU caused this. You can complain and be upset all you want but the only person to be angry with is yourself. \n\nSo stop being angry with yourself, learn and move on. Hopefully then you\u2019ll find someone to treat better.", "YTA. There was no need for you to say that.", "YTA. Rich is being honest with you - you DID cheat on Stella, it WAS a shitty thing to do, and your actions DO have consequences. Supporting you doesn't mean pretending reality isn't how it is - Rich is trying to be a friend to you and give you support in a difficult time, and you thank him with personal attacks? That's a dick move - you need to own that and apologise. Real friends will call you out on shitty behaviour, not just go along with you to boost your ego - it's not always pleasant or comfortable, but this is how you grow as a person.", "YTA good job being mean to the only person that still cared about after you cheated.\n\nWhy are you upset being the cheating man? You cheated. That will never changed or go away. It happen, you did it, own up to it, and be better.\n\nIt never makes sense to me why cheating people always get mad when people bring up their cheating. Don\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t want it forever associated with you.", "Let me get this straight. You cheated on your GF and all your friends called you out on it except for one. So, the one friend that tries to overlook what you did and be your shoulder to cry on and your response is to shit on him for being unable to keep a GF.....\n\nYea, major YTA", "So you turned against your one friend that was unfailingly loyal to you and stood by your side even though you were in the wrong. Sounds like you are the one that has trouble keeping relationships including friendships.

You are a shitty friend, a hypocrite (you clearly can't keep a girl either), and a stubborn AH who can't apologize or own his mistakes. Sounds to me like you didn't lose a bunch of friends just because she alienated you from them but because of your own actions, which include your inability to own up and move on, and your ranting and calling Stella names.", "YTA Stella isn\u2019t alienating you from your friends; you did that. You cheated and they felt that you crossed a moral boundary that made them rethink associating with you. The one friend who did stick by you put up with your inability to take accountability for your actions, including the fallout. Then when he tried to be an actual friend by calling you out on your poor me act, you lashed out at him. I\u2019ll be surprised if you have any friends after this if you can\u2019t take a step back and see that you are continuing to hurt people because you won\u2019t take accountability for anything you do or say. You admit you messed up, but you aren\u2019t really taking full accountability for how you have hurt multiple people.", "Don't worry you have more qualities than being a cheater, you are also immature, have a bad temper and struggle to take resposibilty for your own actions oh and also YTA", "Massive AH.

The consequences of your actions hurt huh. Other than cheating it seems you have narcissistic qualities- lashing out once held accountable.

As far as what you did to Stella, it really depends on how long it's been since you broke up. It sounds like you've done alot to correct yourself and hopefully not repeat that mistake in the future. It can be very tiresome when your friends or family won't let go of the past. If I were you, I'd get my friends together, including Stella, and have a discussion about moving on from this mistake. Unfortunately if they're unwilling to move on, or even have the discussion, you really only have 2 options: 1)Cut off ties with your friends, or 2)suck it up and deal with their hate.

Apologize and just learn to control your rants. It's ok to vent to friends but the reason you feel like you are only seen as the cheating man is because it's likely ALL you will talk about lately, because it sucks and you wish things maybe happened differently. Natural and normal feeling. Guilt is totally understandable. But if it's all you show to people, in the end, that's all they will see.
