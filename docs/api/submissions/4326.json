We started dating 3 years ago and the honey moon phase started to slowly dwindle. At this point, Stella only came over to my place for either sex or to have something.

This destroyed me and I was full of guilt, so I told Stella and we broke up. Now almost ALL of our mutual friends hate me and take Stella's side for everything. The only one who stood by me was Rich (23m) my best friend. He helped me through my breakup, encouraged me to get through therapy, and has heard me out. But the more I ended up getting frustrated with Stella trying to alienate me from our friends, the more I ranted to Rich about it, calling her names in emotion. But Rich would always go \"well you DID cheat on her\" or \"well you DID do this or that\" and it's really annoying. I KNOW I fucked up, I feel so guilty, but I don't need to be reminded of it every time. To have my entire being reduced to solely a moment. Now Rich is a shy guy, he had a girlfriend but she dumped him because she found him too anti-social and uninteresting. His love life is non-existent. So one time when he tried defending Stella, I told him straight up, \"you know you can't even talk about girls when you can't even keep one for your life\" or something like that.

As far as what you did to Stella, it really depends on how long it's been since you broke up. It sounds like you've done alot to correct yourself and hopefully not repeat that mistake in the future. It can be very tiresome when your friends or family won't let go of the past. If I were you, I'd get my friends together, including Stella, and have a discussion about moving on from this mistake. Unfortunately if they're unwilling to move on, or even have the discussion, you really only have 2 options: 1)Cut off ties with your friends, or 2)suck it up and deal with their hate.

You did mess up and your friends chose her. That is their right. She isn\u2019t forcing them to pick sides, they picked their own side. \n\nMaybe you do have other good qualities, but based on this post it\u2019s hard to see what they are. Your friend stayed by you and you completely crapped all over him when he got dumped. Now you won\u2019t apologize for that?  Seriously you don\u2019t see what the problem is?", "YTA. Apologize and just learn to control your rants. It's ok to vent to friends but the reason you feel like you are only seen as the cheating man is because it's likely ALL you will talk about lately, because it sucks and you wish things maybe happened differently. Natural and normal feeling. Guilt is totally understandable. But if it's all you show to people, in the end, that's all they will see. Use your guilt to help propel you forward in life and make better choices. I understand your grieving, but at some point, it's time to have other things to talk about so you aren't stuck in the past.\n\nEdit: also, just some other advice. Take it with a grain of salt I'm just another imperfet human but I'm older and have dated in multiple serious relationships so just going to give you some thoughts here to help with your behavior with the cheating. When your relationship is stale, you do need to spice things up. Aspects of the \"honeymoon phase\" never have to end. We let them end. We need to cultivate it. Make it happen deliberately. We were used to the feeling of love coming first, than the action, but most stuff in life actually does not work this way at all.\n\nThe choice comes first, the feeling after. Like working out at the gym. Hurts at first but the results can be great. You should've initiated something spicy with your ex before masturbating with a stranger. You felt things were stale so you were seeking out what doesn't feel stale - that's the right idea but terrible execution. It's ok to seek out sex in a committed relationship, just seek it out with your partner?\n\nIf you're just missing the feeling of novelty, well, that's just never going to come back once you know a person. There might still be small stuff to learn the entire relationship about each other but that strange and new and unusual feeling can be super exciting, but it's shortlived. It's almost a form of lust to me? You have to find other things to sustain the relationship on cause that's what relationships are in this form (committed and/or monogamous). They aren't for the novelty, they are for the other things. People don't want these relationships for the novelty. They want them sometimes for the lifelong commitment and happiness they feel it brings in that way. Growing old, all that sappy sort of stuff.\n\nYou need to decide if you really want to work on love and be in a relationship before you get into them. Novelty is what dating around is for. Long term love looses it's novelty but that's what people like about it. They like that the person isn't fresh and it's someone they know so well, and can bond with so well, that it's for life sometimes. Maybe you don't want these things. And you're also only 22. You probably shouldn't be in any serious relationships till you are ready to be seriously into them enough to work on them in this way. I think you're way too young to be dating for marriage or anything like that lol but everyone has different opinions on that.\n\nI think this is important to think about to move you forward. It's ok to want novelty, and date around, sleep around, etc. as long as done responsibly. If this is something you really want, which I think it could be since you couldn't control your actions and cheated, just stick with that. Be clear and open and only take on partners that want that though. If you only want to see someone for awhile, experience their novelty and have fun sex with them, that's ok. Lots of people do this or have phases of it. And it helps eliminate the hurt. Some people still \"catch feelings\" as they say. Doesn't have to be a strict rule sometimes love happens but this helps if someone is jumping into bed with you for other reasons than you, to keep them from getting hurt. We need to know what we expect from each other to be successful in dating. And we need to know what we want so we aren't trying to move the expectations of the other person into something they didn't want and vice versa. Like people who get married and one wants kids and the other doesn't, and they think the other will change their mind = bad moves.", "Damn, you burned ALL your bridges \nYTA", "He supported me at first but now he's just criticizing me endlessly.", "Would you argue that there was any reason for Rich to say those things to me?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You can keep friends to save your life it seems", "YTA you keep going like this and you will have nobody lett", "YTA. Sounds like you can\u2019t keep a girlfriend or a regular friend for that matter. Rich will be just fine, by the way. Mature women love the quiet, responsible type.", "INFO: How will you ignore every comment here to ingrain yourself as the perpetual victim of your own actions?", "YTA. You seem to have a habit of disrespecting people who care about you", "YTA- not only did you cheat on this girl and trashed her name but you\u2019ve decided to drag your friend when he\u2019s done nothing but try to help and remind you of how you should do better next time.", "YTA. Apologize", "INFO: If you wanted to have sex with someone else, why didn\u2019t you just break up with Stella?", "YTA \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a single moment though was it? It was the discord moment, then moments of texting or chatting before finally making a plan to meet up. You didn\u2019t fall into this. This wasn\u2019t a moment of bad judgement. It was a plan that you came back to again and again and then executed. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be seen as a cheater, don\u2019t cheat. \n\nClearly you are not deserving of his friendship.", "You apparently didn't \"get through\" therapy if you're still carrying all this shit around with you.\n\nYTA.", "True friends stick by you when you mess up. I think that's why he's the only one that didn't completely abandon you when your relationship ended and your dirty laundry was aired. He's a true friend!\n\nOne of the things about true friends, though, is that they hold you accountable for your actions. Friends will say, \"man, I love you. I know you're going through a tough time right now and I know youve got a lot of emotions, but what you just said is uncalled for.\" \n\nYTA. he's just doing his job. Throwing out personal insults like that in the face of some well-needed criticism is just going to alienate the one friend you have left. Do some self-reflection and Apologize before it's too late.", "You can't really keep a girl for your life either so... maybe the issue is you cheated and YOU are making it your entire personality now.\n\nYou cheated. Your former friends are disgusted by it. They dropped you like the bad habit you are. Move on.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019re the one who keeps bringing Stella up to Rich. While he may have stayed loyal to you, that doesn\u2019t mean he agrees with what you did or that Stella is wrong. He\u2019s pointing out the truth\u2014you did cheat. And, unfortunately for you, that often comes with huge social consequences that go beyond the demise of a relationship. Rich is telling you a truth you don\u2019t want to hear. If you don\u2019t want to hear it, don\u2019t bring up Stella. Simple as that. \n\nAs for what you said? That was just needless and cruel. Apologize, mean it, and be grateful that you have a friend loyal enough to stick by you and honest enough to have character.", "YTA. if you really know that you fucked up, you'll accept that you're the AH and everyone is going to look at you like that. If you talk shit about Stella of course you'll be looked down upon. Classic f boy. You say you know what you did wrong but you expect everyone to just forgive you. Keep your mouth shut about her and maybe people will start to forgive your mistake.", "YTA so you\u2019re a cheater and now a bad friend? Yeah I see why everyone is taking her side", "Brb, getting the world's smallest violin \n\nYTA", "Rich sounds like the kind of friend you want to keep around. GOOD friends will criticize you and call you out on your BS when it's necessary. It's actually one of the best qualities of a real friend, because they know you better than anyone so they're equipped to recognize when you're going too far.  Criticism of such magnitude can be difficult to hear, but it is absolutely necessary, and i hope you can recognize he's coming from a good place trying to help you. You should apologize to him and make amends or you're going to regret it.", "Info: what words have you been calling Stella in frustration? \n\nLooks like you\u2019re a dude with no social anxiety. How about you go make new friends and forget about these ones. You\u2019ve fucked up with them.", "He isn't criticizing you endlessly. He is stopping you from talking shit about your ex when you were the one who caused the issues.", "Maybe he\u2019s trying to get you to stop harping on all this and give you feedback so you can reflect and move on. Sounds like you spend a lot of time angrily lashing out at Stella and he\u2019s probably sick of hearing over and over with no progress of letting go of that that anger and moving on. \n\nYour comment was hurtful and extremely out of line and if you keep treating the people around you like this you\u2019re gonna find yourself very alone.", "Probably because you're insufferable", "Yeah because he\u2019s sick of listening to you whine when YOU are at fault here. Learn your lesson and move on.", "Yes. You seem obsessed with guilt because you keep talking about her and making accusations (\"trying to alienate you from your friends\" is probably code for \"she told them what I did\"). He's trying to bring you back to reality, which apparently you aren't ready for.", "Yes. Because you were being completely unreasonable and saying terrible things about a girl that you CHEATED on and hurt very badly. You needed to be reminded that all of her actions are to protect herself from how YOU HURT HER.", "I would agree with you IF Rich is just calling you a cheater, unprompted and no reason, etc. to hurt you. It sounds more like though you keep ranting about what happened, and how upset you feel, so this is becoming his response to this neverending spiral because he's trying to wake you up. That's why his answer it what it is: you cheated. You were wrong. I get why you feel upset with your ex GF but in logic you have no justified reason to be for the hurt you feel after you hurt her. I'm not saying don't acknowledge how you feel - you should so you can reflect and work on yourself. But you're likely beating a dead horse with your friends. They know why what happened did, why you were wrong. You're not coming into any new info or doing anything productive and keep repeating yourself. So naturally they are repeating themselves, too, cause the response isn't different.\n\nThe response that needs to be different is yours. How do you respond to your life? How do you fix your problems? Start thinking of that. And when you need help with that I'm sure your friend, if you haven't lost him after this, is willing to still listen and be helpful but with the things you'd actually need help with. He can only be your emotional support so long. You need to start making tangible steps forward like well, I know this makes me more prone to cheating, I'm going to stop doing that. Or rethinking what kind fo relationship style works for me, etc. etc.\n\nThat's the stuff you can maybe get help with later from your pals or advice/support. But friends don't want to support bad behavior. You need to give them some good stuff to support", "Yes cause you CHEATED!", "Yes. You called your ex names and blamed her for how people have been treating you... because you cheated on her.", "Yes. Because you kept going on about Stella. He was responding with facts about what you had brought up.\n\nIf you don't want to hear it, don't talk about her like that.", "I\u2019d argue there\u2019s no reason for you to keep complaining about the other person when your actions are the one that ended the relationship. You don\u2019t have to continue with how much of a bad partner she was or how she\u2019s being too harsh after the break up after you cheated. It\u2019s kind of pathetic, my guy.", "Lol oh love", "Your friend was there for you trying  to give you a reality  check  so you can adjust your attitude  and correct  your behavior. A great friend he is,  you on the other hand do NOT take responsibility  for your actions  which is why you insult your ex and on top of it you intentionally  hurt the person  who supported you and tried to help  you.\nYta and a huge one at that.", "He wants to be the victim here, clearly.", "It's very possible his friends wouldn't outcast him, either. He's giving them more reason to want to. Like, you already cheated on Stella. Now you won't stop playing the victim about it. I could forgive you for mistakes but now this is happening all the time and it feels deliberate and like you just don't care that you did something bad, you just care whether we stay or not after and that's making us uncomfortable. He's trying to hold onto them by pushing them away. You just have to live life better from here, OP. A good rule of thumb: if you have to convince people you are a good person, either they aren't good people or you aren't. The evidence naturally shows through our actions. A good action I think you can take is apologizing to whoever needs to be apologized to and just stop bringing up these issues with them about the cheating that happened. If you still need someone to talk to about your feelings though, seek that out certainly. But find an appropriate source. Be a more pleasant friend to be around and people will take notice that you aren't venting as much, etc. Hopefully if you've all been good friends for awhile they'd be willing to be patient and see you progress into better behaviors.", "At least be faithful"]}
