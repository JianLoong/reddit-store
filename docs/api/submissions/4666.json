Is he calling later because he's going out to lunch with coworkers? If so, he can set up a time before lunch. But I do not understand all the y t a comments here. He leaves you home alone with two young kids and then wants to disrupt their schedule. He's definitely TA here.", "NTA- os there another time of day that might work?

Which is fine.  But for some households, the sleep schedule is not flexible AT ALL.   I come from a family with several sets of twins, and believe me, those parents live and die by the schedule.  They do not mess with the put down routine, and they do not budge on the bedtime by a single minute.  This is truly inconceivable for parents who play it even a bit more loose with their schedules.  But parents have to do what works best for their OWN household.\n\nFor the people pointing out that he is calling before their bedtime, I would have to wonder if they have kids at all.  The put down can be one of the worst parts of the day with kids.  There is a reason it is a traded off chore in many equal parenting households.  It's a whole routine.  Perhaps a bath, followed by PJs, then a five minute cuddle in the rocking chair, then you read two books, then into bed, where it is 3 kisses on the forehead, 4 good nights, a hug, 5 air kisses, a spin, a flicker of the lights, then a shut door.  Followed by being called back into the room five seconds later for a glass of water and something they just remembered they had to tell you before they go to sleep.\n\nThere are memes about these last few minutes before actual shut eye.  The other parent repeatedly calling in to rile the kids up and throw us off schedule would piss me off.\n\nI understand and sympathize that he wants to see his kids.  But YOU are the one left home alone to FULLY handle two young children.  You have explained to him what he is doing makes this harder for you.  He should respect what you are struggling with and try to find a different time to speak with the kids that doesn't add to your burden at a rough time of the day.", "NTA, you've tried offering alternatives, and kids that young NEED structure and a set routine", "NTA.

What\u2019s the time difference? How long is he gone for and how frequently?

And he can call earlier. He chooses not to. Clearly he doesn\u2019t care about their sleep or respecting not getting them all wound up as mom is trying to get them to bed. Not cool.", "NTA. As their father he should understand why you're not answering.  Maybe you guys can send videos back and forth instead of video calling", "Sorry but no, NTA here. I have a 10 and 3 year old and during holiday seasons my husband works late. If he wants to tell them good night then he better do it on time. I understand getting busy with work, so you skip a day and you can tell them good morning the next day. When you agree on something you stick to it. If he can call on time then he should, if he cant then he should apologize and call the next morning. Not throw off schedules that don't have that type of wiggle room. Calming kids down enough to sleep in 30 minutes is, in my experience, an impossible task.

So that's stressful and feels like you're managing the best you can.

Your husband knows this because he's home when they're in bed at 8pm.\n\nIf you need the call to be before 7:30, so that you're able to settle them in bed, then your husband needs to get with the program. It feels like you've been flexible, so I think he needs to stick to that boundary.", "NAH, everyone acts like work is so cut and dried. Let him call up to bedtime, but cut the call short if he calls late. I don't agree with cutting him off completely. In my current job, I get a lunch hour, no additional breaks, and when that hour starts varies widely on who is calling and what they need. I would be fired quickly for promptly cutting someone off to call home every day. Maybe he should consider calling before work starts?", "NTA the sleep schedule is God.  Period.  All violations should not be tolerated.  And you did tolerate at first, but the phone calls kept coming later in the evening.  I've noticed a pattern in my own children  (4 in total) for every hour kept up past bedtime is an entire day of behaviors because of it.  They don't get up any later in the day.  They're not sleeping in to make up for it.  They're up at first light becuase THEY ARE TODDLERS.

NTA", "NAH at that age its hard to get the routine down right, and when you have it down, you keep it down.\n\nIts sucks for your husband. Maybe send him some videos of the kids saying goodnight.

A lot of the y t a comments are claiming it doesn\u2019t hurt to mess with routine once in a while. A solid week of daily adjustments is a lot and takes a ton of time to recover from.

I know schedules are necessary, but if they go to bed at 8 then maybe when he calls he can read them a bedtime story, or just quick hi and love you to them. Allowing them five minutes to talk to their dad is not only good for them, but probably also helps him deal with being away. Having raised 3 alone, five minutes as long as it's before bed or reading them a quick bedtime story, before 8 won't hurt anything.

Big time. And it\u2019s the kind of petty that will really bite you in the ass if anything ever happens to your marriage. Act right.", "Ever put yourself in his shoes for a second. Not sure what  your husband does. But if you want a little perspective, will share a bit of my experience. I know when I have to leave for work, how hard it is going to be for my wife to take care of kids. Their is such a sense of guilt for not being able to be around for her. I sometimes have to leave for up to 12 weeks. Then when kids ask me on day two, how long till I come home, my heart brakes again as I sit in my little camp room feeling like a failure to not be there for  them day-to-day.\n\nBut we all do what we have to do. I'm involved in industrial construction and have no idea from hour to hour, what my day is like. When we work we work, if  I have to start a weld, I can't leave till finished. I think I have an hour to spare and jobs take longer then expected.\n\nMy ex, yes she is my ex now, keep doing what your doing and you will find out. Did the same thing as you. I would rush rush rush to finish in time to get back to  my phone to call home. I would be heartbroken when she didn't awnser the phone. I just found it absolutely disrespectful.  It made me feel like two cents, that I messed up yet again I disappointed my family and children. I was working 16 hour shifts daily for weeks on end. Believe me I know how important  routines are for children. But damn,  a bit of flexibility would be appreciated. I was doing best I could, as I know she was at home. \n\nIn the end I was just so hurt , I felt I was sacrificing so much time away from my kids to enrich my family's financial life in the long run. I didn't have a problem. We had a problem. But instead of trying to come up with a solution, she would just dictate the terms as if she was only one struggling. Then to not awnser the phone is incredibly disrespectful. At least awnser the phone and tell him he missed his window and kids are half asleep, call back in the morning. But to be away from your kids and the person you love, is being a gate keeper and not awnsering phone. It was so hurtful and lonely.  In the end, I changed careers so I could stay home and be there for my children more. But I left her narcissistic gaslighting ass. \n\nAnyway, don't assume he's just being disrespectful to you. He may be out there trying his hardest, just like you are at home.  Either way, everytime you deny him a chance to speak with his children, he will be hurt, which willnthen turn to anger and bitterness.

But the way I see it, your job as a parent is to give your kids the best opportunities and experiences in life you can. Denying your kids the opportunity to talk to their father - even briefly - for the opportunity for more sleep seems wrong to me. Same as the one commenter who said they won't move a toddlers nap for family Christmas seems really wrong. The opportunity for time and building relationships with family is way bigger than a sleep schedule and if you have to deal with demon toddlers to provide that opportunity, well, welcome to parenting.

Especially when you have young kids at home. I love how everybody says \"he should work around it\". No company sends someone on an 11 day trip with a light schedule. Everybody does what they can to get their employees home for weekends. A 2 week trip is a HUGE investment and you can bet he's swamped with work.
