But maybe, you could be right", "Thank you, but really I think he just deserves it so it\u2019s not a big deal on my part to honor bro code. He\u2019s super friendly, always invites me to stuff, shares his alcohol with me for free without asking me to pay him back, etc. So I\u2019d feel really bad fucking him over like that", ">You don't do anything sexual with anyone your friend is interested in unless/until you talk to them first.\n\nIkr?\n\nDoesn't girls also have a long list of things you don't do with boys that another girl friend has a crush on?\n\nThere's nothing sexist about it, as a girl I would be pretty bummed if a girl friend hooked up with someone I have a crush on and knows about it.", "I agree. It's a general friendship code that applies both women and men. You do not get involved with someone your friend is interested in or their exes. That simple.", "I found it weird too how involved she seemed in the whole thing emotionally", "I guess her view was more along the lines that rejecting her because of my friend makes it seem like he has possession over her or something. Idk", "Yeah, the way I see it is, will she sleep with other people? Yes. Does she have the right to sleep with other people? Yes. But will I hurt my friend further by participating in that? No, because then it\u2019s twice the pain on his part", "I\u2019m not sure telling my friend the girl he\u2019s in love with tried to hook up with me will do any good", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Haha she clearly doesn't see anything wrong with it \ud83d\ude05 OP is too good for her and she knows it.", "Yeah, the way she\u2019s so invested in this is absolutely crazy", "Exactly, it\u2019s such an absurd buzzword to use here", "Exactly. She can sleep with whoever she wants to, no doubt, it\u2019s just not going to be me because if I fuck her I\u2019m metaphorically fucking my friend too", "This", "Not only are you NTA, you are also a great friend, and a man of culture \ud83e\udee1", "Nah, rejecting her because you don't want to hurt your friend isn't the same as saying your friend has a \"claim\" to her. She's intentionally twisting things, my guess is to start drama.", "She has feminist world view. From that lens she is actively looking for something to be interpreted as sexism, even if it is nowhere close to be the case.", "You forgot the part about her not having right to have sex with you", "Would he still be mooning after her if you did?  It sounds like he can do better than her, perhaps try and dissuade him from someone that isn't interested.", "I think it would. Because he maybe can move on.", "Totally agree. Ignore her ranting is what I\u2019d do", "I appreciate that man, but really my friend\u2019s just a great guy so I wouldn\u2019t do that to him. I mean, I transferred here last semester and he was one of the first guys to always be friendly with me, invite me to stuff, etc, and he always shares his alcohol with me without asking me to pay him back", "Yeah, seems that way, it\u2019s absurd otherwise that she\u2019d care this much", "That isn\u2019t a \u201cfeminist world view\u201d lol, she\u2019s just a clown. Most women who identify as feminists are not that stupid"]}
