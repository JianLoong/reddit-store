If you want to soften it by saying the girl he likes was also way drunk and you'd never do that to him and you'd also never take advantage of a drunk girl, do that. But you gotta tell him about the other girl's nonsense. She is likely to confront him about how you think he \"owns her\" or whatever. Don't let him stumble into that unprepared.", "It may be painful for him to hear but it would be good for him to know, so he can adjust his expectations/desires with her and begin the process of moving on if that's what he wants to do.\n\nSometimes being a good friend means telling someone something they don't want to hear. And better to hear it from you than from someone else, which could lead to losing the friendship over distrust stemming from hiding it from him.\n\nI know that if I was madly in love with a girl who I had an ongoing fwb situation with and presumably some idea of becoming serious later, I'd want to know if she tried to fuck one of my best friends, especially at the end of a night that I'd invited her out to. It would hurt but it would be necessary, and hopefully I'd see that as a sign that my hopes for a real relationship with her weren't going to come to fruition.

Where the friend stands is that he likes the girl way more than she likes him and it seems like the friend is already aware of that. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, I think telling the friend about this refused invitation is just going create drama and angst without helping the friend in any way.", "She probably thinks that rejecting your friend is an insult to the friend, somehow.\n\nShe probably thought you were implying that her friend sleeping around as a single woman is shameful and she owes sex to only your friend because she flirted with him and that's why you rejected her. Or that you were willing to flirt with her but not sleep with her and that makes you bad, I guess.\n\nI've met girls that are like that, drama follows them everywhere.
