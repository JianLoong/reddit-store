Meanwhile our close family are taking my side and friends are split. I for one don't see what I can do. \n\nFor context, we live in Europe. \n\nThe issue is the following: My in-laws halved the amount of money they give my wife each month and she wants me to make up the difference out of pocket. \n\nFor it to make sense i have to explain our finances. \n\nI am a medical resident, my pay is shit frankly. But it doesn't matter, because I have real estate properties and make a decent amount of passive income from rent. My wife does not work, because she is still in law school and her time is full between that and taking care of our son(2y).\n\nSo here is the situation. 20% of my income goes straight into our savings, this I will not budge on come hell or high water. About 40-60% goes into household expenses, this includes the nanny/housekeeper, food, gas, electricity, and my wifes school expenses. The percentage varies each month ofc course but lately due to the war all these expenses have risen, so its always on the higher side. The rest of the money is split between my wife and I but not evenly and here is why:\n\nBefore we even got married my wife had an agreement with her parents: As long as she stayed in law school and kept her grades high she would receive minimum wage from them. So that she didn't have to work and could focus on school. When we got married I promised to give her half of what her parents gave her each month. This way our monthly pocket change would be roughly the same. \n\nThis agreement has worked for the past 4 years. Unfortunately this midterms her grades dropped. They're not terrible mind you but her parents have high standards so until she can get her grades back up in February they said they'd half her monthly pay. I kept the amount i give her the same. Essentially she receives minimum wage now. \n\nMy wife has asked me to increase how much I give her to make up the difference. I refused, and I still refuse. My income didn't magically increase in a month. \n\nI pointed out that she had an agreement with her parents and me. That her decrease in her money is a result of her actions. I upheld my side of the bargain. I told her she will just have to deal with a little less personal money for a couple of months until she can get her grades back up (I'm 100% certain she can do this). \n\nShe maintained this isn't fair and that as her husband i should take care of her. She said i could just lower how much i keep to myself or raise the rent since i already rent under the market price. \n\nI told her i am not raising rent and leaving people homeless in these uncertain times, and that if i give her more from my own side i'd almost have nothing left for myself each month. \n\nI really wish i could give her more, i do, but i can't magically make more money, and i think i deserve a little for myself as well. IMO her receiving minimum wage without working is enough. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1667902735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yphv29/aita_for_not_giving_my_wife_who_doesnt_work_more/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even tho you have income doesn't mean you should pay everything and also pocket money for her. She already has the luxury of you paying her law school and parents giving her money, so she doesn't have to work. That's pretty spoiled tbh. Other people have to do school and work the rest of the time to finance everything. She has to take of your son, but she's behaving like she needs to get paid for that.

Other things are possible, too -- what if her parents' financial situation changed, and they were suddenly unable to pay?  \n\nGoing forward, the two of you should sit down and come up with an entirely new agreement. Her parents' payment to her should go into house total hold income rather than to her. Your respective shares should come from splitting total income -- so when total income goes down, you both have a little less.

If she cannot get her grades back up, she should adjust to her new financial situation - and therefore work more.", "Second edit....INFO. While reading the comments, i realized i missed stuff. Your pocket money should be equal. You're both very privileged. So i dont have a ton of sympathy for either of you. But she does the bulk of childcare when your housekeeper isnt there? Be honest, a housekeeper who sometimes will watch the child? Or a nanny thatbdoes light housekeeping? Either one still leaves your wife with the bulk of either childcare or housework. And does this person come every day? Or once a week? \n\nNeither of you are working. You are both fortunate enough to have income you dont work for. SHE, by your own words, is going to school AND caring for your 2 yr old. You just have school. You guys should split the money so you both have equal amounts of pocket money.

Is it really just for extras? \n\nBut I don\u2019t like how you talk about her not working, like she\u2019s lazy when she\u2019s raising a two year old and going to law school. Both of those are investments in your life, not wastes of time. Force her to quit now and become a waitress, and you\u2019d be throwing away a lawyer\u2019s income. \n\nAnd I find this whole money for grades thing humiliating. Is she really an irresponsible child who won\u2019t try her best at freaking law school if daddy and sugar daddy don\u2019t reward her for it? How do you know 100% that she can get high grades?

Every good law school prohibits students from having outside jobs because law school is more than a full time job.

OP\u2019s wife can\u2019t do that because she is essentially a single parent because he\u2019s a resident working long hours. The nanny is not live in so unlike OP, she is responsible for the bulk of childcare that happens.

You're a partnership and in my opinion you should be sharing your finances and supporting each other. As such I would suggest you pool your spare spending money and her money from her payments and split them 50/50 (which it sounds like what was ultimately happening in the first place). This way, yes you're getting punished for her dropping her grades, but ultimately you are thriving or struggling as a team. \n\nThat said, I think your wife could do with a bit more reason and compassion with regards to her comments about your renters etc. and also take responsibility for her causing your finances to dip.", "NTA.

There can\u2019t be that much left over for his own fun money. So there\u2019s no financial abuse here.
