Meanwhile our close family are taking my side and friends are split. I for one don't see what I can do. \n\nFor context, we live in Europe. \n\nThe issue is the following: My in-laws halved the amount of money they give my wife each month and she wants me to make up the difference out of pocket. \n\nFor it to make sense i have to explain our finances. \n\nI am a medical resident, my pay is shit frankly. But it doesn't matter, because I have real estate properties and make a decent amount of passive income from rent. My wife does not work, because she is still in law school and her time is full between that and taking care of our son(2y).\n\nSo here is the situation. 20% of my income goes straight into our savings, this I will not budge on come hell or high water. About 40-60% goes into household expenses, this includes the nanny/housekeeper, food, gas, electricity, and my wifes school expenses. The percentage varies each month ofc course but lately due to the war all these expenses have risen, so its always on the higher side. The rest of the money is split between my wife and I but not evenly and here is why:\n\nBefore we even got married my wife had an agreement with her parents: As long as she stayed in law school and kept her grades high she would receive minimum wage from them. So that she didn't have to work and could focus on school. When we got married I promised to give her half of what her parents gave her each month. This way our monthly pocket change would be roughly the same. \n\nThis agreement has worked for the past 4 years. Unfortunately this midterms her grades dropped. They're not terrible mind you but her parents have high standards so until she can get her grades back up in February they said they'd half her monthly pay. I kept the amount i give her the same. Essentially she receives minimum wage now. \n\nMy wife has asked me to increase how much I give her to make up the difference. I refused, and I still refuse. My income didn't magically increase in a month. \n\nI pointed out that she had an agreement with her parents and me. That her decrease in her money is a result of her actions. I upheld my side of the bargain. I told her she will just have to deal with a little less personal money for a couple of months until she can get her grades back up (I'm 100% certain she can do this). \n\nShe maintained this isn't fair and that as her husband i should take care of her. She said i could just lower how much i keep to myself or raise the rent since i already rent under the market price. \n\nI told her i am not raising rent and leaving people homeless in these uncertain times, and that if i give her more from my own side i'd almost have nothing left for myself each month. \n\nI really wish i could give her more, i do, but i can't magically make more money, and i think i deserve a little for myself as well. IMO her receiving minimum wage without working is enough. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1667902735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yphv29/aita_for_not_giving_my_wife_who_doesnt_work_more/", "score": 741, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even tho you have income doesn't mean you should pay everything and also pocket money for her. She already has the luxury of you paying her law school and parents giving her money, so she doesn't have to work. That's pretty spoiled tbh. Other people have to do school and work the rest of the time to finance everything. She has to take of your son, but she's behaving like she needs to get paid for that.

Other things are possible, too -- what if her parents' financial situation changed, and they were suddenly unable to pay?  \n\nGoing forward, the two of you should sit down and come up with an entirely new agreement. Her parents' payment to her should go into house total hold income rather than to her. Your respective shares should come from splitting total income -- so when total income goes down, you both have a little less.

If she cannot get her grades back up, she should adjust to her new financial situation - and therefore work more.", "Second edit....INFO. While reading the comments, i realized i missed stuff. Your pocket money should be equal. You're both very privileged. So i dont have a ton of sympathy for either of you. But she does the bulk of childcare when your housekeeper isnt there? Be honest, a housekeeper who sometimes will watch the child? Or a nanny thatbdoes light housekeeping? Either one still leaves your wife with the bulk of either childcare or housework. And does this person come every day? Or once a week? \n\nNeither of you are working. You are both fortunate enough to have income you dont work for. SHE, by your own words, is going to school AND caring for your 2 yr old. You just have school. You guys should split the money so you both have equal amounts of pocket money.

Is it really just for extras? \n\nBut I don\u2019t like how you talk about her not working, like she\u2019s lazy when she\u2019s raising a two year old and going to law school. Both of those are investments in your life, not wastes of time. Force her to quit now and become a waitress, and you\u2019d be throwing away a lawyer\u2019s income. \n\nAnd I find this whole money for grades thing humiliating. Is she really an irresponsible child who won\u2019t try her best at freaking law school if daddy and sugar daddy don\u2019t reward her for it? How do you know 100% that she can get high grades?

OP\u2019s wife can\u2019t do that because she is essentially a single parent because he\u2019s a resident working long hours.

You're a partnership and in my opinion you should be sharing your finances and supporting each other.

This way, yes you're getting punished for her dropping her grades, but ultimately you are thriving or struggling as a team. \n\nThat said, I think your wife could do with a bit more reason and compassion with regards to her comments about your renters etc. and also take responsibility for her causing your finances to dip.", "NTA.

She is not holding up her financial end of the bargain because she is not, right this minute, paying anything but is being paid to study and, because he pays for everything and gives her pocket money, is more than being paid for childcare, childcare she has less of to do because she has a nanny. \n\nWhere's the equality in the relationship? Everyone else gives, she takes, and then she throws a tantrum when it isn't good enough for her.", "Op is paying for her education while she handles childcare, which she has a nanny helping her out in that. It's unfair for him to take up all these responsibilities and still have less pocket money while she's contributing part time child care", "Oh, the horror! What a monster OP is to save for their future and have some insurance against financial difficulties when his wife wants more spending money! Oh, the unfairness! \n\nIf her grades improve in a few months, her pocket money from her parents will go back to normal. In the meantime, she can go without some treats whilst OP saves for their future, pays all their bills including her school fees (which is investing in their future) and gives her pocket money.\n\nThe fact the wife thought other people's rent should be raised so she can have more pocket money tells me exactly who she is. Others should have to suffer and lose out on money so she can have what she wants.", "I also wouldn't budge on savings for fun money.", "She does more childcare while he pays for her education", "Tbh, since they live in EU, lawfully speaking she most likely ahoud be paying gift taxes. Not sure about exact amounts and after which sum.\n\n for example In Finland  you can be given up to 5000e  within 3 years from the same donor. Every gifted money ,from the same donor, after 5000e is taxable money=gift tax. It varies between the the gifted amount but the tax is 7%-33% of the sum in finland. And in different EU countries it can even be way more.\n\nSo In conclusion, she is propably committing **tax evasion** ,unless they live in those couple countries that doesnt have gift tax(unlikely given the odds).", "So there you go: her parents were/are controlling  AHs who used her grades to keep her under their thumb, and now she has a husband is doing the same - if only she would be better behaved, you would reward her with money. \n\nShe should just quit her studies to take up a job; she would retain her dignity a bit. Or she should break up with you, so that she gets more self reliant.\n\nYTA.", "Still, husband and wife need a conversation as equals. Sure, my husband and I decide all the time to cut back subscriptions and classes and when family income goes down, Disney+ and climbing class gets canceled. But starting the marriage on this foot where she\u2019s paid an allowance and \u201cdoesn\u2019t work\u201d when going to law school and taking care of the two year old, that\u2019s not good. Law school is a family investment. The properties are a family investment. Even your residency is a family investment. \n\nSo I think ESH\u2014 \n\nshe should understand without being forced that Disney+ gets cancelled when family income goes down. She should act like a grown-up and recognize this is a frill and not act like a teenager whose allowance has been cut. She\u2019s in an enviable position and needs to appreciate that. \n\nBut you also need to shift to a \u201cwe\u201d perspective. She needs to understand the financial situation and be part of making these decisions. A sad \u201chere\u2019s our new financial situation, here are our expenses, we need to make this work\u201d should be more effective at making her an equal and making her act less like a dependent.", "read his comments. She does all the childcare even when he is home.", "She's absolutely being punished. He says so in another comment that if she had some things under control and gotten better grades he would have increased her allowance.

If he doubled her minimum wage that\u2019s about 8-24 each. Given the fact that he said with his contribution she has about minimum wage now I\u2019d predict that it\u2019s on the lower end of the scale.\n\n\nDo with this information what you will.\n\n\nEdit: these are hourly rates", "Yes and so is she?\n\nIf their spending money was equal and she is now getting half of what she used to than she is struggling.

I do not believe he should make up for all of what her parents used to, and set him self back below what she is getting.", "That\u2019s not what I mean by equally. I mean equally splitting the total money.  If he has 200, and her parents give her 100, then he should give her 50.    That would be splitting equally.", "But it offset their marital spending. It was a low enough number that it didn\u2019t even equal his own fun money, and it mean that less family money needed to go to her fun money. It also sounds like they aren\u2019t going to give money to her after law school, it\u2019s just to help get her through so she can focus on school. \nOtherwise, I\u2019d agree. One of my pet peeves is when men\u2019s earnings are for the family and wive\u2019s earnings are for her.   But this one feels different to me.  I think he\u2019s benefitting from her parents money just as much, due to the amount and timeline.", "Well again, I disagree with him making up all of the parents lost finances.  I\u2019m saying he should giver her a little more so that they can be equal again.  When they got married, they chose to be partners. \nI\u2019m also not saying that he SHOULD be doing 50/50 childcare with her.  I\u2019m just saying that her larger contribution to that should be acknowledged.  He doesn\u2019t do as much of that because he doesn\u2019t have time? Well that\u2019s a luxury he has BECAUSE she is there to do \u201chis part\u201d for him.  That\u2019s my whole point. Partners should help equalize each other.  He\u2019s too busy to parent more? Then she does more of it herself, to help him out. He has more money coming in? He shares it with her to help her out.  Sharing equally, not giving her more than he has left to keep himself.  \n\nReally, they should have waited to have a kid and maybe even waited for marriage until they were a little more established in life. But they decided not to. Both of them made the decision to commit as partners and complicate their lives further with having a child young, so they should both be working together to make the most of it. \n\nI\u2019m not comparing her to the average student. I\u2019m comparing her to OP because they are the two that are \u201cin this together\u201d. Yes, she seems to have a really great set up with a lot of things handed to her, but so does he.  He\u2019s only 27 and can afford a wife, her law school bills, a nanny, and a cleaner. I\u2019m sure he works hard, but you don\u2019t think he\u2019s completely self-made, do you? Remember most of his money comes from passive income. Owning properties.  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but let\u2019s not pretend that he hasn\u2019t had a lot handed to him as well.  They are both very much in a state of privilege and my personal belief is that since they chose to marry and have a kid, one should not live at a higher standard than the other.", "I must have misspoke somewhere because everyone is implying that I think she should get more spending money than OP.  I do not think that. I think they should  be equal. They were equal before.  If he has 200 for personal and she now has 100, due to the parent issue, I think he should give her 50, so they are equal. \nIt sounds like they both have a ton of responsibility, and also, a ton of help. \n\nLet\u2019s also maybe stop saying that \u201cshe\u201d has a nanny.  THEY have a nanny.", "He pays for a nanny and housekeeper also...", "Only rich people pay or even think about paying taxes on their gifts lol. Her parents probably pay them for her and still gives her the full amount.", "Would this really apply to a spouse? In the US, gift amounts are up to $1300 per person but does not apply to money given to a spouse.", "There's no close family exemption?", "In Europe, alot of schools are free, aside from having to buy books.\n\nCant say for sure tho that their schools are free, since I dont know which country they live in", "Parents giving rewards isn't controlling.  They're under no obligation to give her anything at all.  OP certainly shouldn't be required to give her all of the leftover money at the end of every month seeing as he's already paying for everything else\n\nJHC, the entitlement.", "What? He's not doing that. Her Parents are giving her less, he isn't. He just isn't giving her more money for worse grades.", "I think we have different points of view on the word punished. The pocket money is linked to two things, 1) the agreement with her parents that she gets high grades and 2) that OP provides her with half of what her parents do. If anything, according to their agreement, OP should be decreasing her allowance, not increasing it and he's choosing to keep it the same. The money is to treat herself to little extras, she'll be fine.", "He is a doctor and father he gets zero time off. Stop being sexist", "Marriage is an agreement that is why they have prenups \n\nStop making this into some personal mission that has nothing to do with what has been said", "She's not struggling - OP is still paying for her school, all the household expenses, the nanny, and the housekeeper. Her reduced income is purely out of her \"fun money\".", "I agree that things should be equal but the wife wants her original level of income. She was getting an amount from her parents and half that amount from OP. Parents cut theirs in half, wife wants OP to adjust what he gives to take her back to her original amount. This leaves OP with much less than he's currently getting. \n\nSo for example: Parents gave 250 and OP gave 125 for a total of \n375. At this time they both had approx. 375 as pocket money. Now parents = 125 and OP = 125 for a total of 250. OP is still at 375. If he gives her the original 125 and compensates her for the half the parents stopped giving her, plus the 125 they still give then she's at 375 and he's down to 250. \n\nWhat she wants is not fair to him, he's not responsible for the deal she made with her parents. If she were asking for an equal amount then that would be different but she's not, she wants her original amount. (we don't know for sure that she takes on most of the after hours child care, he may be an equal partner in that regard)\n\nETA: I just read that wife does most of the childcare so I take that part back.", "How do you know OP is not involved in childcare?\nHousekeeper and nanny are being hired to \"take most of the burden at home\".\n\nIn case I have misread this information please point out where this has been mentioned. I would correct my reply then.\n\nIn addition, OP is paying for her school. So technically she is getting more money than OP.", "she is already only getting 25% less, and only temporarily.  if parents supply half,and OP supplies half, only the parents' half is getting axed. he stated he's giving her the same amount of money. the wife's gripe should be with her parents, not her husband.", ">If their spending money was equal and she is now getting half of what she used to than she is struggling.

She is getting less \"fun\" money, to name it appropriatelly, since everything else is paid by husband. Having less \"fun\" money for few months is not struggling. Struggling is when you can't afford rent, food, childcare....Her husband covers all that. She is terribly entitled IMO.", "She has food and shelter that she doesn't have to worry about every month.

Wah, poor baby can't buy all the clothes she wants or go out to eat every day, life is so hard.", "Wife caused her own decrease in income.  Why does OP need to make that up, so that wife gets spending money but then he, in turn, doesn't?", "He said He would be left with nothing, if he payed the difference to his wife, and the difference is half of what she used to get= they roughly have the exact same amount of money for personal spendings, wife propably has a little more than He has", "No, the more logical version of what you're saying is that everything should go into one communal pool, with each getting equal fun money out of said pool. That would make sense to me, but that's not what the wife is asking for. She wants to hold all the money from her parents separate from the pool, and because it amounts to less then her husband's fun money he's obligated to \"make her whole\". That's not reasonable.  \n\nEven if they practical result of these two different scenarios might be similar (for now) the principal that what's hers is hers and what's his is theirs is a problem.", "What he has and how he got it is irrelevant. What he has is benefitting them both. What money she has benefits her. She wanted other people to have their rent raised and potentially be made homeless because she wants. \n\nYou aren't hearing what I'm saying. Her contribution is acknowledged in the post and OP gives her pocket money to spend on herself, which can be considered payment for childcare. \n\nHe is sharing his money with her by giving her pocket money and paying for everything. Again, what is she contributing to the bills? If one partner pays for everything and gives spending money, and the other pays for nothing and spends all their money on themselves, are they equal? \n\nYou are now making it so that OP isn't self-made, so of course he should give more. It's not fair on his wife that she have her life subsidised and everything paid for, not to mention spending money. Nope, she needs more because otherwise it's all uneven. OP has the luxury of her looking after their kid, but she has the luxury of a nanny/housekeeper to take care of her kid and house that is paid for by OP.

Should he hire more help around the house?", "That's why he's paying for her school expenses and the nanny is taking work off her hands so she can study during the day.
