He has two 18 year old's, a boy and a girl, who are not twins. What happened is my brother cheated on his late wife (his daughter's mother) and got another woman pregnant with his son. The biological mother of his son did not want to be a parent and she walked away from their child. My brother's late wife decided to raise him as her son and raised both kids together in the same house as siblings. Both kids were aware of what happened and my late SIL never wanted to hide the truth from nephew because she felt it would be worse to find out later in life that he wasn't her bio kid.\r\n\nLate SIL died when the kids were 10. They bought thought the world of her and she was by far the better parent out of her and my brother. So when my brother met current SIL, they were angry, furious even, that he was moving on after what he'd done to their mother. They felt he should stay alone for the rest of his life out of some kind of penance for the cheating and betrayal their mom. What made it all even worse is my brother packed up all his late wife's things and disposed of them. The kids say he threw them in the garbage and my brother said he sent them to his late wife's parents. But anyway, they were gone, which infuriated the kids more.\r\n\nSo over the next 7 years of them all living under one roof, my brother's bio kids were just waiting for the day they could leave. While SILs son was growing attached to them as a brother and sister and he really did adore them and want to be with them always. I remember when he was in kindy he drew the older kids as his heroes and said they were the best siblings ever. I always sensed that he was going to get his heart broken and that proved to be true when my brother's bios both left the home and became estranged from my brother, and his whole household by extension.\r\n\nNow my younger nephew is heartbroken and so upset that his siblings are gone and he hasn't seen or heard from them in months. He was asking if they'd be at his birthday and SIL and my brother tried to say yes but my mom stepped in and told them to be honest or they'd crush him more.\r\n\nSIL was talking to me about how much it hurts her and how she wants to do something. I told her the only thing she could do now is get him therapy to help him work through this. It's having a negative impact in all parts of his life, including school.

Even though it may seem unfair for the little boy who got attached to them, it's a bit much to explain to a child what kind of a person his father is, and why the kids both left.\n\nTherapy is a good suggestion. He's just a kid, knows nothing of why his big brother and sister were there one day, and the next weren't. Those are some big feelings for a small child, and 100% some professional intervention would help him out a lot. \n\nIt's not a rude bit of advice, your SIL should be relieved that there is someone who loves her son enough to suggest something very helpful and probably very much needed.", "NTA\n\nWhat you said was the truth.  She just didn't like it.\n\nThe problem they had was the age gap between the kids.  Nephew is a little kid still and it's not like he can move out.  He's still very much under the rule of thumb of his parents.\n\nThe other thing she needs to remember is that he is not biologically related to either of them.  No matter how much she wants that to be.", "NTA \n\nTherapy is a great idea. It's not harsh its the truth. Obviously the parents have been lying to him about the siblings coming around again and they're deliberately setting him up for more heartbreak so they can avoid one conversation. \n\nYour brother is a shitty human and his kids rightfully so, decided to cease contact. \n\nThat your younger nephew was caught in the crossfire sucks but it sounds like his parents pushed the narrative that their amazing siblings who adore him rather than the truth. \n\nYour mother wasn't wrong to pull your brother and sil up. They need to stop lying.", "\nNta.", "NTA. As far as your niece and nephew are concerned, your brother\u2019s step child is not their brother.", "NTA", "YTA. \n\nYou mom is an asshole too.

Brother placed a number of bombs that blew up years later on his youngest son. Awful.\n\nI can't blame older kids for how they feel. Unfortunately, youngest is paying the price. Get the kid in therapy.", "They have and my brother has never been the best dad to them. So there's a lot that has happened in their lives that all pointed to the outcome they've got. But my younger nephew is not aware of any of those details. He's not aware my brother isn't his bio dad and his siblings are not bio siblings. So this has all been a very confusing and sad time for him. I truly believe professional intervention would help him out as you said.", "There is no hope for reconciliation. The 18 year old's no longer want anything to do with their father and he was not the best dad to them anyway so a lot of messy issues there. They hate their father and they have hated him for almost half their lives now. Even if that hatred goes away, I do not see a time where they will be a family again. They never regarded SIL or my younger nephew as family to begin with.\n\nThe cheating wasn't a one time thing. It was an affair at the time. Late SIL never forgave my brother either. Their marriage was not the same after she found out. She just wanted to make sure my older nephew would be okay and raised with my niece so they stayed married and in the same house but it was very tense.", "Also, why is my mom an asshole for telling them they should be truthful to a little boy who was already hurting?", "Did you advise your brother to get professional help for his other two children when they went off the rails at age 11 with ridiculous and inappropriate demands of their father, when they clearly were not processing their grief correctly, when they were hurt by his handling of their mother\u2019s stuff?\n\nDid you try to help them yourself with advice more recently, maybe suggesting that your younger nephew needs and deserves them like your older nephew needed and deserved his sister regardless of what they think about his parentage. Because you make it sound like after one attempt you watched with relish at the impending explosion. You\u2019re no hero here OP.", "That was a shitty thing for your deceased SiL to do to your older niece and nephew. She poisoned them with her resentment and they will pay the price in emotional wreckage all their lives. \n\nI meant it was one affair, not a one night stand. He hasn\u2019t cheated again, it sounds like.\n\nThe older kids hatred is not healthy or appropriate. It wasn\u2019t when they were 7, when they were 11, or now. You have seen all this over the years and done nothing to protect or heal any of these kids. Shame on you.", "She should have done do privately and suggested ways to do it gently and kindly. Ffs your family is full of wrecking balls.", "I did advise my brother to get them therapy. Not just when he discarded his late wife's things but when their mom died. I told him those kids were hurting and had lost the woman they spent the most time with, the one who did 99% of the parenting and they would need more help.\n\nI did not say that to them, no. I know they do not regard younger nephew as a brother and have no emotional connection to him. That was a very one sided relationship and as much as I hate seeing him suffer. I feel it would be worse for them to string him along when they do not love him, care about him or want him in their lives. I feel like he would eventually figure that out and the hurt would be far worse. They have been open to many family members about their feelings.", "That's not entirely true. We all suspected he did have another affair. Just no kid came from it. It would have been when the kids were about 5. We're not 100% certain but she suspected and so did the rest of the family.\n\nI was someone they talked to and leaned on when they didn't and couldn't talk to their dad. But I was just their aunt. I am not the parent. I have no control over what happens in their lives.", "You seem to assume OP has all the authority in the world as an aunt, she wasn't the parent.", "She did do it privately. Younger nephew was not present when she told them to tell him the truth. But they had said they were going to lie and she stepped in.", "Those feelings are wrong and unfair and no one including you did anything about them. Does your older nephew not see the horrific irony of him, an affair child, rejecting a one non affair half sibling while being accepted, embraced and loved by the other? What a mess.", "Ultimately it\u2019s their choice. Not every truth is appropriate for every age of child. And your family seems to make bad decisions about over sharing with young kids to their emotional detriment.", "They're not half siblings. They're stepsiblings. My brother is not younger nephew's bio dad and he never adopted him either.\n\nI agree that it's a mess. But the kids lives were torn apart and I refuse to judge them for responding as they have. Ultimately they're happier being apart from my brother and they're living their lives now. It's been a few months but we can all see the positive changes in them.", "I\u2019m surprised. You\u2019ve judged almost everyone else.\n\nBut you used the wrong word. What you\u2019re really saying is that you refused to HELP them for responding as they have.\n\nYou should have perceived how they were being emotionally damaged and done more to help them deal with it constructively and healthily, starting back when your now deceased sister in law was making their home a miasma of vitriol. You are a neglectful influence here and you gleefully participated in the harm they are perpetuating on an innocent child out of a misplaced idea that their emotional damage is a righteous consequence earned by your brother.\n\nNews flash: your deceased sister in law was not a better parent. She poisoned these children even as she cared for them. Their dysfunction is a lot on her.\n\nI mean, come on, did you really think their 11 year old demand that their father be celibate as a penance for a something that he did before they were even born is rational, reasonable, or appropriate? That is so messed up on so many levels.", "What?  How did the deceased sister in law make their home a \"miasma of vitriol\".?? \nHow is op \"gleefully participating \". ? \nWhat did I miss.", "If they were told the truth then why would they be raised to CONDONE that kind of behavior. they should be disgusted with their father. Cheating shouldn\u2019t be something forgivable in any sense. Especially in their minds because as children if they were taught cheating was completely ok their future relationships would be in absolute shambles and they\u2019d be doormats.  Now you should never come for someone who\u2019s not alive to defend themselves and she\u2019s dead so what\u2019s done is done their adults they can make their own decisions now. Even if when they were  being  manipulated they often change their minds IF OR WHEN the truth comes out but his their \u201cfather\u201d wasn\u2019t a father enough to even try and make it up to them they should have no obligation to feel like forgiving them. ALSO he\u2019s been the dad of this step kid since he was basically born meaning 8-9 years the elders two  are 18-19, 10 then their mom died meaning not ONLY DID HE GET RID OF EVERY MEMORY OF THEIR MOTHER. LET ME. REPEAT. THEIR. MOTHER. . But remarried and accepted another child almost immediately. Now another thing about the sons irony of rejecting when he\u2019s been rejected. One\u2019s trauma does not mean he OWES OTHERS. No that\u2019s not his kid, they\u2019ve made it clear they want NO relationship. If anything attack the parents for LYING and pretending like this kid would have one big happy family when they KNEW BETTER. It\u2019s HIS MOM and the dad has a new responsibility and if they don\u2019t want to seek help for this child well they may as well expect him to run out the door as soon as he turns 18 too. Because lying to him will get him no where. He needs professional help he\u2019s still a child too but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s up to anyone else but his own mother and father to help him. Not his stranger sinblings they are nothing to him. They do not want him and they do not owe him anything.  It may hurt but what hurts most is finding out people lie to your face and then crush your heart everything they give false promises. Like the he birthday incident. I hope you know that definitely wasn\u2019t a rare event how many times do you think they\u2019ve told him \u201cyour siblings love you\u201d \u201ctheir your brother and sister\u201d \u201cthey\u2019ll come next time\u201d and lying to themselves by believing it\u2019s owed to them to have a sibling bond to believe they should ever have to forgive their father. (Maybe after a while in therapy they can touch that topic) or to even believe they\u2019d stay in their lives.", "I was wondering the same thing. Also, kinda wondering why we're talking about harshly judging people who were kids and are now young adults who have no fault in this (in my opinion) just because you judge the adults.", "OP wrote in a comment that deceased SIL never forgave her brother and that the household was very tense. She also wrote that the kids knew about the affair from a young age - too young of an age. That environment is damaging to children, especially to the son. It clearly affected their attitudes directly.", "None of that indicates that OP was \"gleefully participating\" in anything."]}
