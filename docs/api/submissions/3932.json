It turns out that my brother is the son of my mom's distant cousin and agreed to adopt Tom when they were asked. Tom and I were shocked and when Tom asked for more information our parents hesitated.\n\nTom threatened to put everything on blast to the extended family that they relented. They told Tom that while the adoption process was underway Tom's bio grandparents gave them a significantly large amount of money under the condition that they sign an NDA before and agreed to set up college funds for me and Tom after the first five years of the adoption. It was made explicitly clear that this would be a closed adoption and that if any contact with them or their daughter without their permission was made the college funds would evaporate and my parents would have to pay back the money plus interest.\n\nTom was understandably upset, pointed out that he never agreed to any of this, wanted answers, and would start making waves in the family to get them if that's what it took. That's when I started speaking up. I told him that he should also consider the long term effects, and if he really wanted to be stuck with college debt for the next 20-30 years?\n\nTom then snapped at me and ran off to a friends house. Our parents were hurt but they gave Tom a couple of days to cool off before our mom offered to reach out to her cousins to see if they were interested in meeting with him. That got Tom to come home.\n\nWe watched our mom write and send a short email and it took about two weeks for a response and it stated that they had no idea what she was talking about, and that if their youngest child was adopted then she should consider any consequences that may come from digging up old bones. Our mom tearfully showed Tom the email and he made good on his word. It has been a mountain of chaos ever since and it was revealed that Tom's bio mom was our cousin \"Kate\" (33f), who had a mental breakdown after being frequently questioned about it and is now being hospitalized. Tom's college fund is gone and Kate's parents have sent a legal notice that the would be taking my parents to court for breaking the NDA agreement.\n\nOur parents are freaking out because Kate's parents can hire big dog lawyers while they can't. I make a pretty good salary because of my job and don't have any college debt, and agreed to give my parents financial support each month for at least a year, but I'm not very willing to help pay for Tom's college. Partly because I would have to give all the money I have been saving to purchase a house and partly because I feel that there needs to be some consequences for the actions he took despite multiple warnings. AITA?\n\nEdit: Okay because I'm starting to see a trend let me be VERY clear....\n\n1. Again, I fully believe that Tom is owed answers. Never said he wasn't.\n2. I do think he's in a terrible situation and feel bad for him, and that still doesn't negate the fact that there consequences to his actions whether they are fair or not. He was warned, did it anyway and now has a shocked Pikachu face that his bio grandparents took back the college fund that he was not legally entitled to?\n3.

OP states they sent an e-mail and received a reply 2 weeks later. Who was asking Bio mom these questions? Did the hospitalization happen recently, or did it happen in the wake of the birth and it was relatives that kept asking where the baby was?", "Tom did nothing wrong.

For a 13-14 year old, a pregnancy alone would be traumatic, let alone giving birth. Added to that the way she got pregnant raises more than questions. Of course she had a nervous breakdown.", "Did OP post that? Where are you getting this information?", "OP is his sister, not his parents. Sbe's not obligated to pay for his education.\n\nThe \"grownups\" are the giant AHs here, and honestly start acting like adults.", "I didn't say nor do I believe that the consequences are \"just\" but they are a consequence.

But who was thinking about their children being able to take at home DNA tests 20 years ago. \n\nI just wanted to add to your comment that this situation would also be traumatic for OP. They've also been lied to for their whole life so they're likely not thinking entirely straight either. This situation sucks for everyone involved (except for Tom's real parents and the grandparents - they've created this terrible situation). It especially sucks for Tom having to learn about his past this way and not really being able to get answers.", "See edit", "Yes.

He should not be lied to anymore. Hopefully a lawyer can fight the lawsuit.", "Yes, definitely a dark story, to have been kept hidden under lock and key for so many years. The bio mom had a breakdown and is hospitalized because of being questioned. I\u2019m going to say NTA, but this sounds like such a traumatic conception/adoption. They never wanted to be contacted again and made that very clear. In this case, even though OPs parents were trying to do the right thing, I think they should have honored the NDA. They should have had a plan in place, in case Tom ever asked that question. Like, \u201cit was a totally closed adoption, we went through a lawyer, we never knew anything about the birth mother\u201d, ect. That\u2019s what they agreed to do when they signed the NDA. OPs parents need to get legal advice fast.", "NDA can not ask you to not reveal stuff people have the right to know by law. Kid might very well (depending on local laws) have the right to know his bio parents, and if he has, that removes the NDA. \n\nsince mother was 14 when giving birth, i would say it is a dark story.", ">Yes, they can be sued, but they have a very strong defence.\n\nWith the kind of money they have?

OP's parents need to lawyer up quickly.", "Maybe if Tom was given the info about bio mom's age at the time of his birth, that might've been enough for him to decide he didn't want to learn more because it clearly would be a traumatic story. But he wasn't given that option.", "Ugly as it sounds, I'd bet it was sexual abuse by the grandfather, as the daughter (cousin) has mental issues surrounding it.", "Omg I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t the only one the read the ages, done the maths and thought it was sus af", "And I didn't in my post.

Our mom tearfully showed Tom the email and he made good on his word. It has been a mountain of chaos ever since \n\nMy take from this is that Tom started questioning his grandparents' daughters until he found out who was his bio mom. Basically questioning anyone and everyone, airing out dirty laundry in the hopes that someone of the family could break through and find out who was his mom.\n\nPlus it clearly states that Kate is NOW being hospitalized. Not in the past.", "Also, if they wanted absolutely no contact ever and nobody to know about it, they should have not adopted out this child within the family. I am guessing the young teen was strong-armed into literally every part of this situation.

OP, that means this poor woman was probably raped at 13. Maybe incest was involved? In a situation like this, I really don\u2019t think your parents should have broken that NDA. Tom may still have tried to find out on his own, but they should not have given him any info. They need a lawyer.", "These are all pretty important questions to ask, so he can't exactly be faulted for asking them. Biograndparents are the real AHs in this situation for making such demands, along with your parents for accepting such terms.", "Maybe encourage him to use the courts to get this information. I guess now that the college fund is gone, he has nothing to lose from doing so. He could even bargain for the college money back by agreeing to leave them alone in return for the college money.", "Again...empathy. Try putting yourself in his shoes.", "He didn\u2019t know that he wasn\u2019t going to get any answers until he asked the question.", "I mean, this is very much completely on your parents.

He is ABSOLUTELY allowed to complain; the situation he was put in, by a bunch of adults, is absolutely horrendous. \n\nIt's really easy to talk about consequences when you have not just gone through the shit he has.", "I feel bad for him. Your entire family screwed him over and put him in this awful situation. His welfare was clearly never considered here.", "... Not helping your case for having empathy at all here, OP.", "I'm with ya, personally. \n\n But without knowing the whole story,  did she hide the pregnancy until she couldn't get an abortion? Or was it a family that was against abortion?  I assume it's in the States because of the paying for college. If you are going to force a 14 year old to have a child and give it up for adoption this seems like a pretty good option of making sure the child goes to a loving home and providing for it. There's a few situations, as a parent,  I could see this being the best of a really shitty situation.", "I'll take the L on that one. I missed how old she would have been when giving birth to her son. That's all on the grandparents. Everything else I stand behind.", "Kate was 13 when she got pregnant.

Many students do this.\n\nOption 2: College part time and work part time.\n\nOption 3: Community college for some of his university. \n\nOption 4: Join the army for the minimum period as they will pay for his college afterwards (GI bill)\n\nHe can also combine some of these options and he should also look into college scholarships. This situation is very unfair to him to be honest and likely legally questionable. \n\nHe very well could have taken the issue to court and gotten a lot of the information he wanted and probably still can.\n\nI guess now that he has lost his college fund, he has nothing to lose from pursuing information about his birth and conception. \n\nHe could even bargain for his college fund by agreeing to give up or hold off his research regarding his history in return for the college money.", "His entire sense of self was destroyed, he found out that he is most likely a product of rape, and seeing Kate's reaction, most likely incest, and his biograndparents are AHs that are not above financial abuse to hush it up.

I don't even think the grandparents are in the wrong necessarily because they knew that the child reaching out would be re-traumatizing for their daughter. \n\nIf this adoption had not taken place between relatives, the closed adoption would have led the adoptive parents to never have been disclosed as to whom the birth parents were. So I don't think it's unreasonable to tell the family not to contact them. \n\nMy grandmother was adopted and in her 70s took an at home test. Her birth mother (now in her 80s or 90s) was still alive. But when contacted, birth mother refused to acknowledge her existence. This was back in the 40s when unwed mother's would be sent to church programs where they would give birth and have the baby ripped away from them - highly traumatic. So I assume the mother tried to wipe it out of her memory the same way.", "But didn\u2019t you get to go to college for free because of his adoption?

They\u2019re may have been no crime", "The NDA was for the adoption, not for a crime. There\u2019s a good chance the father was the same age so no crime would have occurred.", "I don't think it's statutory if the other party is roughly the same age.

The whole situation seems sketchy and frankly may not even be legal to uphold the NDA in court. Tom is also not responsible for their backroom blackmail that he was not part of", "No, he hasn't. They put themselves in that position through their actions.", "Lol no, to whom did they disclose what? They didn\u2019t give any information to anyone that didn\u2019t have it and that wasn\u2019t what caused the lawsuit.

I love my parents but what they did was stupid.", "Yeah, biomom and Tom are the victims here. Tge bio grandparents sound like horrible monsters and OP's parents sound completely ill informed and stupidly naive about adoption.

Incest??? Where did you get this info??", "But OP probably didn\u2019t KNOW that\u2019s how he was able to get an education.
