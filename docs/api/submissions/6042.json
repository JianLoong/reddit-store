For some context, Dani was pursuing a college degree that was completely financed by my parents as her mother could not afford it, but in her last year she was expelled due to getting caught plagiarizing on a draft of her thesis. She hid this from my parents for a whole year, but still continued to accept their monthly checks that were meant to be for her tuition and instead pocketed the money (around $30,000).\n\nThis basically has limited her opportunities in the job market as she never graduated, and her then boyfriend left her a year ago after discovering what she had done and didn\u2019t want to be with someone that had been lying about their degree and income. After her initial comment, she then went on to say how if my fianc\u00e9 and I are able to spend all this money on our wedding, we could \u201cput the money to better use\u201d by helping her out instead as she wants to pursue community college courses to finish her degree. I said absolutely not and this caused a huge argument because she kept saying how it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m \u201crubbing it in\u201d about how I get the \u201cfancy wedding and fancy fianc\u00e9\u201d and she is struggling to pay her bills after her ex kicked her out.\n\nI do sympathize with her situation, but she literally cheated, got kicked out of school as a consequence, proceeded to lie and steal $30,000 from my parents, and then lost her boyfriend for hiding all this from him FOR TWO YEARS.

Basically she now is siding with my cousin saying maybe I could scale down my wedding a bit to not \u201crub it in her face\u201d.

You don\u2019t even need people like that in your life.", "NTA and next time granny calls, be like \"I'm so glad you want to give Dani money, do you want me to tell her or do you want to call her?\"\n\nShut that down.", "NTA- Your cousin **still** doesn't seem to grasp that her actions have put her in the spot she's in, and apparently can't help herself but whine when others who don't lie and cheat through life have good things happen to them.  You shouldn't have to sympathize with her because she doesn't deserve it at all.  As to why your grandmother is choosing to be a part of her pity party, that can be her problem, but it sure isn't yours.\n\nI'm actually curious as to what your parents' reactions must've been when they found out she was basically embezzling money meant to pay for an education she wasted.  And $30,000, she really had some nerve to be asking *you* for any financial assistance for school of all things...\n\nNTA, but your cousin is a huge one to the people who used to trust her.", "NTA. You spoke the truth. Dani is jealous and will be for quite some time until she gets her act together. She may never get it together. She basically stold $30,000 she was given to go to school, was kicked out of school for plagiarism. Yep, Dani's kinda lacking in the integrity department. Definitely watch any dealings you have with her.", "NTA\n\nsecrets don\u2019t stay secret very long and hers came out. I\u2019m not saying this bc I hope you would be petty however please you and carter please keep planning your dream wedding. And do it because you want to for yourselfs , not to rub it in Dani face. Don\u2019t even send an invite - that\u2019s 30k she stole from YOUR parents.", "NTA.\n\nKick the cousin and the grandmother from the wedding.  If anyone starts to get on you about them not being invited - uninvite those people too.  You do not need stress or drama on your wedding day.  \nYour cousin has herself to blame and if she didn't want to end up like this she should've thought about that before being an awful person.", "Oh please, NTA! Your cousin is a piece of work.", "NTA - I don\u2019t understand how your grandmother can even slightly think you\u2019re wrong.      \nDani was trying to put you down and humiliate you the whole time.      \nYou simply stated facts", "If someone else in your family wants to hold her hand and spoon feed her, that's on them \u2014 live your life and plan your wedding how YOU want it.", "If someone else in your family wants to hold her hand and spoon feed her, that's on them \u2014 live your life and plan your wedding how YOU want it.", " I don\u2019t want her at my wedding. I don\u2019t trust her because she will try to steal the spotlight.", "Honestly their immediate reactions were that it was some sort of misunderstanding or mistake. That\u2019s the most heartbreaking part for me because my parents truly believed in her future and loved her so much to the point that they couldn\u2019t even initially grasp what Dani had done. It\u2019s been a while since then so now they\u2019ve processed and are absolutely furious with her and those around her who enable this behavior to this day. I think they\u2019re just full of regrets now for ever trusting her in the first place", "Totally agree! Carter and I are on the same page about going forward with our original plans because why should someone like Dani stop our happiness and future.", "I have a nasty feeling Golden Child Dani will be getting more than her fair share in your Grandma\u2019s will to \u201cright the wrong\u201d Dani feels has been done to her. \n\nStill wouldn\u2019t expect her to pay anything back to your parents out of that though.\n\nNTA OP, she\u2019s a thief and a liar and all you did was point it out when she tried to demand more money from the same side of the family she\u2019s already stolen from. If she was truly repentant then I\u2019d be more understanding of Grandma\u2019s seeking compassion for her situation, but she isn\u2019t, so I\u2019m not.\n\nEdit: removed reference to sick grandma saw the \u201cextremely all about keeping the peace\u201d part and misread it as \u201cextremely ill\u201d.", "Some lessons in life are hard and seems that is the only way your cousin will learn them. None of you can save her from herself.", "Dani could have saved face by not being a liar and a thief.", "Did she pay your parents back yet? NTA.", "And consider leaving out Grandma and everyone else who complains.", "Ya I\u2019m sure that\u2019s exactly what will happen with the will situation. Thankfully my siblings and I do not need to rely on someone else\u2019s handouts like Dani, so it won\u2019t matter\u2026", "Nope and we don\u2019t think she ever will. It\u2019s been years and all she had ever said was \u201cit\u2019s coming next month, I promise\u201d and then next month it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m really tight on bills right now\u201d, then repeat."]}
