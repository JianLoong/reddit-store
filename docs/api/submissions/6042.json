For some context, Dani was pursuing a college degree that was completely financed by my parents as her mother could not afford it, but in her last year she was expelled due to getting caught plagiarizing on a draft of her thesis. She hid this from my parents for a whole year, but still continued to accept their monthly checks that were meant to be for her tuition and instead pocketed the money (around $30,000).\n\nThis basically has limited her opportunities in the job market as she never graduated, and her then boyfriend left her a year ago after discovering what she had done and didn\u2019t want to be with someone that had been lying about their degree and income. After her initial comment, she then went on to say how if my fianc\u00e9 and I are able to spend all this money on our wedding, we could \u201cput the money to better use\u201d by helping her out instead as she wants to pursue community college courses to finish her degree.

Basically she now is siding with my cousin saying maybe I could scale down my wedding a bit to not \u201crub it in her face\u201d.
