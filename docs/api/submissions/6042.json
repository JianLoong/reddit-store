We were both at a family dinner party this past weekend when people asked us how the wedding planning was going, particularly my cousin Dani (32F). Carter and I have been very fortunate to be in a situation where we can plan our dream wedding and are able to pay majority of it ourselves and some help from our parents.\n\nWhen we went into the details of how we want it to be a big wedding to invite a lot of friends and family we haven\u2019t seen in years due to Covid, Dani immediately made comments about how we\u2019re spending \u201ctwice her income for one day no else cares about\u201d and many other disrespectful comments throughout the night about our plans. For some context, Dani was pursuing a college degree that was completely financed by my parents as her mother could not afford it, but in her last year she was expelled due to getting caught plagiarizing on a draft of her thesis. She hid this from my parents for a whole year, but still continued to accept their monthly checks that were meant to be for her tuition and instead pocketed the money (around $30,000).\n\nThis basically has limited her opportunities in the job market as she never graduated, and her then boyfriend left her a year ago after discovering what she had done and didn\u2019t want to be with someone that had been lying about their degree and income. After her initial comment, she then went on to say how if my fianc\u00e9 and I are able to spend all this money on our wedding, we could \u201cput the money to better use\u201d by helping her out instead as she wants to pursue community college courses to finish her degree. I said absolutely not and this caused a huge argument because she kept saying how it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m \u201crubbing it in\u201d about how I get the \u201cfancy wedding and fancy fianc\u00e9\u201d and she is struggling to pay her bills after her ex kicked her out.\n\nI do sympathize with her situation, but she literally cheated, got kicked out of school as a consequence, proceeded to lie and steal $30,000 from my parents, and then lost her boyfriend for hiding all this from him FOR TWO YEARS. The reason Dani is in this situation is her own fault, and I told her this exactly in front of everyone at dinner.\n\nNow our grandmother is calling me nonstop saying how I\u2019m being selfish and inconsiderate when my cousin is clearly going through a really hard stage in her life and \u201cfamily doesn\u2019t humiliate one another\u201d. Basically she now is siding with my cousin saying maybe I could scale down my wedding a bit to not \u201crub it in her face\u201d. It\u2019s kind of always been like this with my grandmother growing up because Dani is the firstborn grandchild that came after many miscarriages and was always favored over my siblings and I.

She has had plenty of chances evidently.", "NTA - Dani is an adult and more than responsible for facing the consequences of her own actions. She very well could have not cheated (on a THESIS might I add), and finished her degree. Then she wouldn\u2019t be \u201cbroke\u201d. And she didn\u2019t have to lie to her boyfriend about the situation, but she did and that\u2019s why she\u2019s \u201csingle\u201d.

Do yourself a favor and uninvited both Dani and your grandmother from your wedding. You\u2019re doing nothing wrong and deserve to enjoy this event however you and your fianc\u00e9 choose to do so!", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t actually do much here; you answered questions about your wedding plans and said no when your cousin asked you to pay her tuition. \n\nEven without the history between your cousin and your parents, you\u2019re NTA. \n\nHow you spend your money is your business. It might have been slightly different if you\u2019d gloated about your financial situation or mocked your cousin about hers - but you didn\u2019t. \n\nFrom what you wrote vs your grandmother\u2019s reaction, your cousin is likely telling her a very twisted version of the story.", "NTA!\n\nDon\u2019t invite her to your wedding!\n\nAlso let your grandma this: \u201cDani is an entitled jealous brat. She stole and lied about the truth that she was is school. She cheated on her boyfriend. Got kicked out of school because of the Cheating. Dani not entitled to my money! I worked hard to get where I am today. I don\u2019t want her at my wedding. I don\u2019t trust her because she will try to steal the spotlight.\u201d", "NTA, \n\nYour cousin is entitled and delusional.  Part of growing up is accepting when you've fucked up and owning it. She's in her 30s and has sabotaged her own life. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to sort out her emotional or financial baggage.  Especially when she could have easily put the work in and been in a far better life situation and possibly still in a relationship. She needs now, to grow up and take the hard reality check regarding her role in where she's wound up. \n\nIf someone else in your family wants to hold her hand and spoon feed her, that's on them \u2014 live your life and plan your wedding how YOU want it.", "NTA\n\nDani can go shove it. She made her bed and now has to sleep in it. You have nothing to do with her current financial situation at all. \n\nDid you parents ever recoup the money she literally stole from them? What consequences did she face from them for that?\n\nContinue to plan the wedding you two want and forget about her. But maybe for the big day, have someone on hand to escort her out if she decides to start some sort of drama.", "NTA -- The time and place was not ideal, but Dani is the one who initiated the conversation. Good on you for sticking up for yourself and not bowing to the pressure. Enjoy your dream wedding!", "NTA\n\nYour money, your wedding, you do what you want. It isn't your responsibility to fix other peoples problems. No one is going to look out for you on this planet so you need to do it for yourself. Sounds like Dani needs to start doing the same.", "NTA - I don't everything that was said or how it was said, but it's not your responsibility to finance her life. You also shouldn't have to scale back your own wedding to spare her feelings, she doesn't have to come.", "NTA, I'm trying to figure out why you still speak to this awful woman. How much screwing over of your family will it take to cut her out of your life?", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ll never understand why people think they\u2019re entitled to other people\u2019s money.", "NTA - OP, by the looks of it, Dani sounds like a gaping AH who thinks she is entitled to other peoples money.

You told the truth, you are not a bad person. Don\u2019t let this instance keep you down.", "NTA she scams your parents for 30k and has the nerve to tell you to spend your wedding fund on her?\n\nAlso tell Grandma that you're not scaling down the wedding, as it will be good for cousin to see what hard work and honesty can get a person.", "NTA.  You and your fiance can plan whatever wedding you want, when you are paying for it.

Fortunately, your grandmother doesn\u2019t appear to endorse that, but says you should scale back your wedding anyway.\n\nyour cousin is completely unreasonable and selfish.  I\u2019m glad you told her off.", "NTA. People just hate the truth.", "NTA, but in your shoes I would go to grandma\u2019s house and clearly explain all Dani did, because maybe she doesn\u2019t know, and then say if she continues to favor Dani over you, showing favorites, neither Dani nor her are invited to the wedding. You\u2019re not doing drama.", "Nta.  And you are correct  dani fucked around and found out.", "NTA. You were not the asshole in this situation. While you may have been blunt with your cousin, she was being disrespectful and entitled in her comments about your wedding plans. You had every right to set boundaries and say no to her request for financial assistance. Additionally, her actions in cheating and lying to your parents have understandably caused her to face consequences and struggles in her life. It is not your responsibility to fix her problems or make up for her poor choices. You were simply trying to enjoy your own engagement and wedding planning with your fianc\u00e9 and did not deserve to be treated with such disrespect by your cousin.", "I am glad you did a tattle tale.

My parents do not speak to her or her mother anymore other than at big family events held at my grandmothers house for the sake of not starting drama.

That\u2019s the only part of her life I can even remotely feel bad for.", "Thank you for your response! I agree with you completely, but tbh I think she\u2019s just lazy and doesn\u2019t even want to do the research to see if she qualifies for any financial aid or scholarships.

Just to spare her feelings, really.", "Also warn your grandmother that Dani is just using her as a puppet.", "That's just awful, I can't believe she would take advantage of them like that. She's just not a good person (trying not to break rules here lol). \n\nI'm sorry this happened to them. Meant to say that I'm glad you called her out in front of family, enough is enough with her. Tbh I'd be going NC with her completely.", "And consider leaving out Grandma and everyone else who complains... Seriously, Just because you want a big wedding doesn't mean it needs to be full of AH's. NTA.", "I see, thanks.", "Ask grandma to pay the money back if she's so desperate.", "Definitely - my parents and I are pretty much NC already, but I think we may start not coming to family events that include her anymore. It really sucks, but for the sake of my own mental wellbeing, I think I just need to remove myself from any situation that involves her.", "I don't blame you, what she did is unforgivable and downright disgusting. I can't believe your grandmother defends her so vehemently."]}
