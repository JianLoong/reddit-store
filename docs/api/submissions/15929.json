But I'm still wondering if I'm wrong.\n\nBasically, we have a few things that we still need to move out of our home. I've been recruiting friends to help with the heavy lifting, whereas my wife has been doing all of the packing. She generally has stuff all ready to go by the time we get back for another load but today has been really slow. She's stated she is overwhelmed and has a mental block that is preventing her from completing tasks today. She blatantly asked me to TELL her what she needs to do because she can't think straight. That's fine. We all have days like this. So I tell her to pack up all the dishware, her books (a shit ton) and all the extra totes to be put outside and ready to move, as those are already packed. \n\nWhen I get back home for another load, probably 45 minutes later, she had only moved the totes outside and hadn't packed anything else that I asked. She was sitting on the couch eating. I asked her why the stuff wasnt packed and she pointed to her food, with a \"why do you think\" look. I got irritated, I know she has to eat but it would have only taken her maybe a half hour to pack the stuff I asked and then we could do another load with no issues. So I said \"well it kinda feels like we are accomplishing absolutely nothing today so that's cool\". She immediately snapped at me and told me she is \"so fucking sick\" of me rushing her and that she should be able to \"fucking eat in peace\". She then threw all of her food out and went to pack.

Apparently you already decided that it was too hard!\n\nI have a lot of pity for you wife when your child is born.  In case you don't know, children's inner clocks don't work the same as adult's.  This is also true if you put them on a \"schedule\", which I suspect you're going to try.", "Dude, YTA. I can see in other comments that you expected the division of duties to be roughly 50/50. That's simply an unfair expectation of someone approaching their third trimester. It's more likely that you need to take on a bigger chunk of the workload.\n\nIn another comment you confirm that she did actually pack up the entire house? Give her a fucking break. She did more than her share. She just needed a little minute at the end there. \n\nYou're gonna need to step up.  Apologise unreservedly.", "YTA. Your pregnant wife was telling you she needed a break, dude.

Pregnancy is stressful, yes.

Cause them boxes be so heavy? So YOU need some helpers carrying all those heavy boxes around, cause you like to get shit done quickly while the wifey can do the simple packing? Sheesh... I dissolved my appartment a couple of months ago and while it's a different situation (deciding what to sell, what to keep, etc.) - packing up boxes is the more difficult part of moving. You gotta think about how some stuff will be packed up, which things go together, what needs to be wrapped up, what's at the bottom and what at the top of the box etc. And not only do you not help her, you expect her to get it all done on your super hectic time shedule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>he's stated she is overwhelmed and has a mental block that is preventing her from completing tasks today. She blatantly asked me to TELL her what she needs to do because she can't think straight. That's fine. We all have days like this.\n\nNo WE do not all have days like that. The woman is pregnant. Ever heard of pregnancy brain? I've never been pregnant but I'm empathetic enough to realise that yes, yes, it's real and overwhelming. Especially if you have to pack up a whole friggin household. The emphasis you put in there makes this read as if you find it ridiculous that she needed to be told what to pack. It's really not. Poor woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>probably 45 minutes later, she had only moved the totes outside and hadn't packed anything else that I asked. \n\nWell... how many bags are we talking and how heavy were they? Kinda find that important in the case of a woman who's 23 weeks pregnant and apparently has been packing boxes all day... but even then. What did you expect her to pack up \"a shit ton\" of books (is it just me or does that sound judgemental?) and dishware in 45 Minutes? If that's the \"speediness\" you're talking about this is just absolutely ridiculous. Do you own plastic plates exclusively or how do you expect her to pack up that quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> She immediately snapped at me and told me she is \"so fucking sick\" of me rushing her and that she should be able to \"fucking eat in peace\". \n\nYep.

Get some people to help with packing instead of just helping you move the boxes.", "So, your 23-week pregnant wife, instead of packing \"for another 30 minutes\", ate, meaning that you and your friends should have picked up the extra work AND LET HER EAT IN PEACE. \n\nShe's growing a human, dude.

In this case **SHE IS GROWING YOUR FUCKING CHILD.** Her body and mind are under constant physical duress and hormonal assault. It\u2019s unlike anything you or I have ever experienced, brodude.

If she needs you to rub her feet for a minute, the answer is \u201cYes, Dear,\u201d and then you take a break and do what she needs. You may have to deal with some stress because of a little time crunch- it\u2019s nothing close to the stress of pregnancy. You may have to do extra physical labor and wear yourself out- again, it\u2019s nothing close to the physical wear of pregnancy. She is doing the heavy lifting for the most important work your household will ever know, and if that means you have to deal with some extra stress and exhaustion, the answer is an enthusiastic and grateful \u201cYes, Dear!\u201d You owe her a giant apology, one requisite in size to the gargantuan stature of your assholery.", "Why are you not helping?  What was the urgency?  YTA.", "YTA.  You sound exhausting to be married to.

Even a perfect pregnancy can be exhausting because your body is diverting a lot of energy into building and supporting an entire other person. \n\nMoving is physically and emotionally a lot and during pregnancy it\u2019s a LOT. YTA for being a snide supervisor and not a supportive husband. \n\nBtw get used to things taking 3x longer than you think you should\u2026 just wait til the kid is here. Getting into the car becomes a Herculean task some days.", "Am I the asshole for making my very pregnant wife do all the packing in a impossible amount of time even though she flat out said she's overwhelmed? Yes, YTA. \n\nIn what world does packing up dishes and books take less than 45 minutes? Dishes take hours by themselves if you pack them properly. \n\nYou have unreasonable expectations.", "YTA. I'd perhaps have voted differently had she been earlier in her pregnancy but I cannot fathom why you thought this was acceptable division of labour whilst she's so far along. Packing some boxes before you began moving would have allowed for a more streamlined process. Packing some boxes whilst she ate would also have been helpful.", "YTA educate yourself on pregnancy, fool. There's only about a billion books/ websites/ podcasts on the subject. Your poor wife. Learn empathy. You are not the one growing your baby, she is.", "omg you sound like a drill Sargent!!! YTA!!!! Learn how to chill the fuck out and let people do stuff at their own pace. She's 23 weeks pregnant ffs", "YTA, how about you walk in and start packing, she nearly in her third trimester. Apologize and be more useful.", "YTA. Are you not physically capable of packing? I'm not understanding why you wouldn't just let your wife eat and pack things up while she did. You said you knew she was having a rough day.

Anything other then baby is going on the back burner.  Here is your opportunity to get used to it and try to adjust accordingly.  Also, moving and pregnancy are two of the most stressful activities there is.  Combining both is monumental.  Your personality is perfect for getting it done, but you\u2019re going to have to give a little bit for her.

She told you she didn't have it together that day.
