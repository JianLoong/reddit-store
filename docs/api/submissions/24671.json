I(18m) grew up with my parents' friends' daughter 'Jenny', also 18. Jenny asked me out when we were 16 and we had two wonderful years before she started sleeping with other guys. She begged me to stay and said I should give the whole open relationship thing a try, but I told her no.\n\nHer parents have been begging me to take her back, saying she was inconsolable. She had begged her parents to beg me on her behalf. I didn't want to block them outright since this couple was very kind to me over the years. I've had more dinners at their house than I can remember. So yesterday i told them 'I need some space. Please, please don't contact me today.'\n\nThen I switched off my phone and went to the cinema. Watched the new Mission Impossible three times. At the end of the day, I saw several messages from them saying that Jenny broke down into tears again.

It sounds like their daughter learned that other people's feelings aren't important from her parents.  For your own mental and emotional health you should block all three of them from your social media accounts for at least a month.

Jenny and her parents are overstepping all boundaries here.  You have politely declined to take back their cheating daughter and asked them not to contact you.\n\nIt may be time to be less polite.  Jenny can cry all she wants, the answer is no. They should have taught Jenny about consequences, they didn't. It is harassment at this point. Block all 3 of them on everything.

They ignored your very reasonable request for one day away from this, with this onslaught of emotional blackmail. \n\nFrankly,  all the dinners in the world can\u2019t make up for this disrespect and bullying. In your shoes, I would tell them that since their daughter could not respect you enough to not cheat on you, and the parents could not respect your wishes for ONE damn day, you can\u2019t imagine that any one of them will ever have respect for you, so you have to block them.

I hope your parents are supportive of you.

(As in, an actual conversation, not texting.) tell them that you love and value them and always will. Tell them you and Jenny were a good first relationship for each other.

Mommy and daddy have no place in it! Of course there are times and situations when a family member won't be wrong to interfere (like when there is abuse), but this is not one of them. Break-ups and failed relationships is a natural part of life no one can be shielded from. The parents interfering would be as wrong even without their daughter cheating. So, someone's 2 year old relationship didn't work out. At 18. Big surprise (it is not)!\n\nOP, you need to understand that Jenny's parents are WAY out of line here, and them being your parents' friends don't change it. Tell them something along the lines that you are very sorry Jenny is so sad, but that your relationship is between two of you, and you politely refuse to discuss it with them and won't respond to any messages regarding it. If you feel comfortable, discuss it with your parents (or they might get this story in a very distorted form). \n\nBut overall only a person you're (or was) in relationship with is entitled to any explanation, or discussion, or anything else. It might sound a bit crude, but people who are/were not in bed with you do not get to have an opinion on whom you want/don't want here.\n\nOh, and NTA, of course. Jenny's parents are. What they expect to happen when they foist their daughter on an unwilling partner?", "NTA. But I'm sorry you watched the film three times? In a row?? Are you well?", "This is honestly the only update I need from this"]}
