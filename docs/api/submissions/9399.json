It was terrible, and it has left her in terrible condition.  \n\nGrowing up I had a friend at my church who was married to a man in not even this bad of shape.  But he was confined to a wheelchair and had a lot of needs related to his care.   \n\nI know how hard it is.  I saw it first hand.  I am not suggesting he call off the wedding.  All I did was say that they should consider holding off until they see what her life will be like after rehab.  \n\nI am not suggesting that she isn't worth marrying because she is disabled.  She is a very strong and beautiful young woman.  But this is going to be either a difficult lifelong commitment or they will get married with rose tinted glasses on and then it will end badly.  \n\nMy son has a good job and so did she.  But for the foreseeable future they will be a one income family.  \n\nThey were planning on having children.  That is off the table.  At least biologically.  And I honestly have no idea how hard it would be to adopt with them as parents.  Not because they would not be loving parents. Because she may not be able to care for a child by herself.  \n\nMy son is angry with me.  He says that he loves her and that I'm being ableist. I'm don't think I am.  I'm being a realist that wants the both of them to get past all the \"Walk to Remember \" stuff and see what their future actually holds before they move forward.  She isn't even out of the hospital yet.  I have no idea what kind of medical debt this is going to pile on them.  \n\nTo be clear.  I am not suggesting at all that he just call off the wedding.  Just that there is a lot to consider and look at from a pragmatic point of view. \n\nAITA or a realist?", "created_utc": 1675812342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wgmxy/aita_for_suggesting_my_son_postpone_his_wedding/", "score": 1724, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have to be able to Keep on loving each other, and caretakers fatigue is a Very real thing that can and has ruined so so many relationships. \n\nHeck they might even end up resenting each other because of her inability to have children now.

The reality is that being a caregiver is hard, and most people do not fully understand what it means to be the only person in a partnership who can do things. Is he prepared to do all the chores, earn all the money, drive everywhere, possibly help her with home care, etc? Without knowing her exact condition it's hard to make a judgment on whether what you said is valid or not, but taking time to genuinely understand and consider the reality of changed abilities isn't ableist. \n\nThe idea that people should have to magically accept a radically changed life because disability isn't their partner's fault is bullshit. If my chronic illness got bad again and my partner left, it would feel awful, but he didn't sign on to be a caretaker, and I don't think I could blame him for wanting to be able to have a full life-- a life that my condition would prevent. You may not have worded it well, but your point is valid. He would feel a lot worse if he got married and started resenting her down the line.", "NTA, marrying someone with a life altering, and new, disability is not a decision to be made lightly.

And pretending that shitty things won\u2019t change one\u2019s life isn\u2019t going to make it any less unfair. \n\nPlenty of people get married, go through traumatic events, and end up divorcing after realizing their lives don\u2019t work anymore. It\u2019s not really anyone\u2019s fault for feeling that way. \n\nWe can debate all we want about the right and wrongs of wanting certain things (nomadic lifestyle, biological children, HCOL location etc), but we can\u2019t pretend that people won\u2019t feel strongly about these things and may no longer be compatible with people who cannot equally share these things. It\u2019s not wrong so much as life is unfair. \n\nHe\u2019s of course angry because youre suggesting he may love his fianc\u00e9e less after the accident, which isn\u2019t at all what you\u2019re saying.

I get why some people think you are, but I don't. It's the truth. Even if she wasn't disabled that is STILL good advice. Marriage is no joke. It can fall apart for healthy couples let alone one sided dependant relationships. If he's not going to be able to care for her long term, it might be best to make sure she gets settled somewhere that can accommodate her and then move on with his life. I have an aunt who lost a leg in a car accident and got a TBI and her quality of life has been awful. My grandma, and now my uncle, have had to care for her her entire life. It's easy to say it's no problem because love rises above all else, but I imagine it's a LOT harder to live it. My aunts accident was 40 years ago. That's a long time. Her life was ruined on that day. I wouldn't blame anyone for not being able to commit to that for life. They aren't even married.\n\nEdit: also, that's your child.

It doesn't even sound like a wedding in any capacity is on the table currently.\n\nRecovery is necessary for a wedding. They can surely get married but an actual wedding will at least require her to be out of the hospital.", "NAH. I may get downvoted but here is why I say this.  From your post and comments I have gleaned that you are a caring parent that was asked for advice.  You didn't volunteer it.  You gave logical and pragmatic advice.  That is something hard to do in such an emotionally charged situation.\n\nYour son is 100% not the asshole for wanting to do everything for the woman he loves.  Up to and including doing whatever he can to give her continuity.  \n\nYou didn't mention age but you said there are no children so I will assume that your son and his fiancee are young.  It is hard for young people to hear hard advice.  Even when they ask for it.  \n\nI hope you are supporting your son and maybe just listen instead of talking for a while.  He will need you in the days, months, and years to come.", "NTA. I know this won't be a popular opinion but you're his parent. He asked for advice. Her accident is life changing for them both and they need to go in eyes wide open about how their dreams and plans are likely to change. He'll need to be prepared for circumstances that few young couples go through and make sure he's willing to make all those sacrifices along the way. \n\nYou've raised a good man who loves his fiance no matter what. He asked and you've articulated what you feel he needs to think about. Now you need to support whatever decision he makes. \n\nI wish you all well and I hope she heals well.", "NTA.  You\u2019re not an asshole for bringing up your concerns.  Unfortunately, I think this is one of those cases where if you\u2019re right, no one is gonna thank you for being right.  And if you\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s gonna be constantly brought up until the day you die.", "NTA - I would say the same to my son.  I'm in Canada so hospital bills are not an issue, but there would definitely be loss of income and other financial considerations.\n\nPlus, as she's still in the hospital, do they know how extensive her issues will be?  Will he need to change her diapers? If they can have children, even by adoption,  could she realistically handle them?\n\nYou obviously raised a caring son.  And you're still caring for him by raising your concerns.", "NAH- I'm giving you NAH because he DID ask you your opinion, you didn't hit him with this out of the blue. If she has been in the hospital for a couple months, then they may have to postpone it due to her recovering (depending when it was scheduled for).  \n\nYou did mention that she is a physiotherapist, even if her injuries do mean that she can't work anymore, she is probably in a better position than most people to be realistic about what her limitations and expectations should be. And she will probably follow the prescribed recovery plan better than most patients! \n\nI don't think you're concerns came from a bad place, but being strong and facing this together might be what is getting them through this. Knowing that her fiance is there for her 100% might be more important right now than the pragmatics.", "Now if you were just suggesting to postpone the wedding to give her more time to recover so she can enjoy the big day properly that would be fine. \n\nBut it sounds like you want to postpone the big day to give your son a chance to back out in case her disability is \u2018too hard\u2019 which is ableist and definitely YTA", "Jfc , if he asks your opinion and it is a realistic view, he doesn't have to like it but if asked, don't lie.\n\nNTA, sometimes telling someone that waiting to see how their loved one will recover isn't mean.\n\nHis life is going to change, hers already has.\n\nHard facts, some people have a hard time adjusting to trauma.\n\nSome aren't able to take care of another person with severe injury.\n\nEven if they were married, she may need institutional care, so to try to hurry and get married with the injuries you described isn't smart.\n\nSometimes love isn't enough.\n\nI wish it was.", "NTA - I am very surprised by all these answers. If you have never taken care of someone with a brain injury or spinal injury or lost a limb, these are such horrific injuries. You have no idea if the person will be the same personality - I can tell you with my mother - she was never the same person. And when she died 20+ years later after her injury (by old age) - I didn\u2019t mourn as much because I lost her years ago. \n\nHopefully your future DIL recovers well enough that she really is her old personality. Then the person your son fell in love with - is still there. Caretaker burnout is real, and if she is not really there, this would cause a lot of concern. \n\nI suspect you did not give your son the best advice, since he reacted angrily. I suggest you talk to him again but come from a different angle: Help him start to look for long term care etc. The wedding should be postponed until she recovers. And during this recovery period, he can understand the extent of her injuries. You need to be there to guide his decisions -but now is not the time.", "NTA. They absolutely should wait for at least 3 very sound reasons 1 being the new physical challenges 2 the fucked finances and 3 to adjust to there now very different life. If they love each other why do they have to run a wedding. Their lives just turned a completely new direction and until they know where they are headed they should feel out the road and pump the breaks as needed. The ablist comments are blowing my mind. You never once said she doesn't deserve love now that she can't have children or any crazy ablist bullshit so idk where people are getting that from. It's also not wrong if the son were to say I don't think I can handle this commitment. It's a lot for anyone and one that shouldn't be taken lightly.", "We all like to think we would do the noble thing in this kind of situation.  But, it is pretty common for men to leave seriously ill wives, and there are a lot of moms that wind up raising severely disabled children by themselves.   Not everyone is cut out to be a caregiver.   There is also the issue that the fiancee might qualify for needs based assistance solo, but not if married to someone with a good income.    Pausing for a moment to figure all of this out--for the son to be sure he is the kind of man who can handle this and to figure out the benefits piece is not a horrible idea.", "Nta I have  seen and heard many times how the one spouse not hurt  get tired of caring for the other and become resentful leading to a divorce.  I hear what you are saying.  With my job I've seen the aftermath of the person left", "NTA. You are being realistic. Sometimes love isn\u2019t enough. She also might qualify for medical assistance for the bills if she isn\u2019t married.  She is a zero income injured person right now. If they marry, it could disqualify her from Medicaid or other assistance.  \nIt sounds terrible but you are definitely right.  There is so much to wait and see. Right now it\u2019s easy to say I want to be her caregiver.  I love her! But he has no clue what\u2019s in store.  He might change from the loving husband to caregiver that changes diapers and feeds her depending on her injuries.  Checking on tubes and kidneys if she\u2019s wheelchair bound.  Maybe she will heal. Or heal 50%. Either way. He shouldn\u2019t rush this. Focus on her healing and eventual rehab.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing you worded it poorly given most of this post but your instincts are sound. I appreciate the common use of the phrase ableist now but he is young and unmarried. It\u2019s worth considering postponing the wedding if only for his fianc\u00e9 to participate more fully. Your son should absolutely get a prenup to make sure he isn\u2019t responsible for the medical debt if the marriage doesn\u2019t work.\n\nGiven the disability and relative youth without children, it doesn\u2019t seem like this marriage has the highest odds of long term success so a little pause before the wedding wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing.\n\nThe only real issue is that if his fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t on board he is basically dumping her after she became disabled and will have to live with that for the rest of his life.", "NTA.  You have given your son the best advice you know how under these terrible circumstances.  I am not going to criticize you for that.  He is your son, and I cannot honestly say what I would do in the same situation.  But now, it is time for your son to decide.  All you can do now is support him in whatever decision he makes.  Sometimes, when we love our children, we have to say things we wish would never have to say.  I wish you all the best.  Stay strong.", "I keep going back to the fact that your son asked you for your advice.\n\nYou gave it assuming every option was still on the table. \n\nThe reality is your son already feels married to his fianc\u00e9e and the ceremony was making vows that were already there official. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t asking whether to stay with her. He was asking how find enough strong to get through this.\n\nBut you didn\u2019t understand that.\n\nI may be wrong here but I think if the accident had happened after the wedding your advice would be the same - to see if he can handle it before deciding whether to stay. So even thought I do keep going back to the fact that you gave advice only after it was asked for, this makes it clearly YTA for me.\n\nI find advocating for abandoning a partner to avoid medical debt, to avoid the hard parts of \u201cfor better or worse\u201d is pretty horrific. People are allowed to do it but I\u2019m then equally allowed to judge them for it.", "What in the actual fack?\n\nWould you divorce your spouse if they were in this shape? You\u2019ll probably say no because I committed to him/her and they are my husband/wife. \n\nWhat you need to realize that if your son and his fianc\u00e9 were already planning to marry, they are already THAT committed. A marriage is nothing more then a piece of paper, it\u2019s not like you wake up the next morning loving them more then the day before, or being more emotionally committed to them. By the time someone gets engaged and plans a wedding they are/should already be THAT committed to them. They are already a family, they are already emotionally husband and wife. The wedding/marriage is a formality. \n\nGive your head a shake and learn what supporting your son and daughter in law actually is. \n\nYTA an exceptionally large one.", "NTA. In fact most therapist would advise you put major life decisions on hold. Making big life decisions about home, work, or family while traumatized will only increase the stress in your life. If possible, try to wait until life has settled down, you\u2019ve regained your emotional balance, and you\u2019re better able to think clearly.", "I'm gonna go against the major vote and say NAH. (based on OP saying he asked for her opinion).\n\nHe loves her, he wants to marry her. How is his fiance? I would only have suggested postponing until she's maybe a bit stronger, but not because of that whole 'rose tinted glasses' thing you said. \n\nI'm assuming you're in the US, so it's normal to be concerned about the extortinate bills you guys get. It kinda makes sense to prioritise her health first, then put the wedding second. But at the end of the day, if his fiance is insisting she still wants to get married regardless of injury and recovery, let them be. It's common for a lot of partners to do a runner when their partner gets sick or badly injured. He's obviously a good, committed man.", "I'd say the way you framed this as your son needing to decide if his fiancee is worth marrying anymore makes YTA.\n\nPersonally, if you had either framed the discussion as trying to make him do self introspection on whether or not he can provide the support his partner needs or you had suggested postponing the wedding so that the emotional scars from the accident have more time to heal, then I believe you would have been fine.\n\nEdit for typos", "FYI: A person who uses a wheelchair is not \"confined\" to it. The wheelchair enables them to get around! They would be confined if they didn't have it, but since they do have it, they are *not* confined.", "NTA.  He asked you, so it sounds like he is already having these thoughts, he just doesn't want to face it at the moment, which will be extremely difficult for him.  I don't think you said anything wrong, but you need to not bring it up again unless he raises the topic.  Is he speaking to someone about it what he is going through?  Because this is a life changing impact on both fiancee and him.  Depending on the severity of the TBI this could also have significant impacts, my friends BIL has TBI and is unable to move or communicate after 6mths, he can only open his eyes a little, so the prognosis for any further recovery is not good.", "YTA\n\nABSOLUTELY keep your opinions on this matter to yourself. \n\nI'm curious, tho:\n\n> terrible condition\n\nThis entire post dances around spelling out exactly how she emerged from the accident. \n\nParalyzed?

YTA", "YTA- I understand postponing or pushing the wedding back to giver her more recovery time, but the motive for your pushing back the wedding is seriously out of line. \n\nClearly you want your son to call everything off. You\u2019re talking about unknowns and your son is already trying to live by his wedding vows even though he hasn\u2019t taken them yet. He clearly loves this woman and you\u2019re trying to push him away from her by talking this way.\n\nThis woman is to be your daughter-in-law. Until your son or her say otherwise, you should treat her with that kind of respect. Your son is old enough to make decision about who he will marry and you need to back off. \n\nSo what if they may never be able to have biological children.

It could be that by getting officially married, she'll be disqualified for government help.\n\nEDIT assuming this is in the USA.", "NAH. This might be controversial to say but this isn\u2019t as cut and dried as so many people are making it. The fact is, divorce rates increase significantly where one spouse becomes disabled. If you add in the added financial hardship and not being able to have children, especially if your son wanted to have biological children, there is going to be an unbelievable amount of stress in this relationship. He asked for your advice and you gave it and I think they would be wise to hold off since there has been such a momentous change in their lives. That being said, I don\u2019t blame the son for thinking he can make everything work out. That\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re in love. All in all, though, I don\u2019t know if AITA is the best place to discuss this. You should encourage your son and his fianc\u00e9 to seek therapy before making any decisions.

I would have understood if your intentions were due to financial difficulties with the accident/her injuries and you suggested them putting it off until they were more stable in that department but NOPE. Your suggestion is because you think your son will change his mind about spending the rest of his life with his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nYou absolutely are ableist and discriminating against your future DIL because of something entirely out of her control. The fact that you brought up her being unable to biologically have children without detailing whether that was originally on the table for them, and insisting adoption isn\u2019t an option makes me feel like you\u2019re angry about her not being an incubator for your future grandchildren.

I would back off and let them go through this however they see fit if I were you. Be there for support if you can manage to bite your tongue but don't push future unknown scenarios on them now.

When you love people, you lift them up and support them. \n\nThis is the opposite of that.\n\nThis is what bad parents do.", "NTA, but I think you handled it a little bit poorly. The son absolutely needs to take some time to reevaluate if he wants to go through with his marriage. Absolutely. He\u2019s not doing himself or his fianc\u00e9e any favors by staying with her if he\u2019s unable to handle being a caregiver for her. If he\u2019s not able to do this without being miserable and resentful, then leaving her would be an act of love. \n\nThe life he agreed to enter when he got engaged no longer exists.

I do agree with you that he needs to take some time to experience this. \n\nHowever, I think you weren\u2019t in a good position to give advice, even though he asked.

It\u2019s hard for me to say what you should do because I can\u2019t say if you\u2019re ready and able to be a caregiver for her and accept the new changes in your life.

Please stay out of other people's business.", "YTA. Not your business and not your call.", "NTA, but only by the thinnest of margins. Fiancee has been in the hospital for months, and her injuries include a broken spine and TBI. The reality is that these types of injuries cause divorce and breakups a lot, even among couples who have strong and seemingly perfect relationships. Son undoubtedly needs someone in his life giving him permission to take some time to consider if he can still go forward with the marriage and what his life will be with his fiancee if they stay together. The reality is that sometimes love just isn't enough to stay together through the types of strain these injuries and permanent care needs put on a relationship. \n\nNow, the flip side is that *you* don't know what his life will be like either. You've only seen what this level of disability looks like from the outside. There is absolutely plenty of joy and happiness to be had when you're on the inside. It's also far too early to know for sure what support needs fiancee will have long term and if she and your son would be able to have children together. (Assisted reproduction and adoption are still very much on the table if they are able to provide appropriate care for children.) Medical technology that treats fiancee's injury types has advanced very quickly over the last few decades, and is on track for continued advancement. So, you definitely don't know her long term prognosis because nobody knows that, not even her actual care team.\n\nAlso, it's important to understand that your son is going through a grieving process. TBI, in particular, can often be experienced by family/close friends as a form of death because of the profound personality and behavior changes that can happen. This means you need to be very careful to be sensitive to what your son is actually asking you and is actually seeking for feedback/advice. Your son's reaction might have been normal grief anger, but sounds likely that you responded with the advice you wanted to give instead of the advice he asked for. If your advice is more about your dreams for your son/future DIL than what your son asked for in support, that does make you an AH.", "I would have said not the AH if the reasoning was that he take time and ask himself whether or not he can provide the care his partner needs or you had made the suggestion of wating so that the trauma to the fiance could have had more time to heal my vote would have been different.

You also seem to be weirdly hung up on whether or not biological children would be a thing.  That is rude.  You are correct, love is not enough to sustain this situation, it will be hard for both of them and the last thing either one of them needs is your terrible attitude.

I hope she gets better, and they can sit together and talk about their future in a very long conversation to see where they stand. \nIn the meantime, just be supportive towards your son.

Look into disability benefits for your state. A friend of mine's husband became bedridden because of a horrible disease. They did not get as much help as they could of gotten because they were married and her income was taken into consideration for his benefits. If they do not marry then it might be better for her regarding income, insurance and care. Be there for your son and help him do research to find out what is best.

You were not a participant.  You will not be a participant in your son's marriage, either. \n\nOf course there will be extra challenges, but no marriage is challenge-free.

She is a very strong and beautiful young woman.  But this is going to be either a difficult lifelong commitment or they will get married with rise tinted glasses on and then it will end badly.  \n\nMy son has a good job and so did she.  But for the foreseeable future they will be a one income family.  \n\nThey were planning on having children.  That is off the table.  At least biologically.  And I honestly have no idea how hard it would be to adopt with them as parents.  Not because they would not be loving parents. Because she may not be able to care for a child by herself.  \n\nMy son is angry with me.  He says that he loves her and that I'm being ableist. I'm don't think I am.  I'm being a realist that wants the both of them to get past all the \"Walk to Remember \" stuff and see what their future actually holds before they move forward.  She isn't even out of the hospital yet.  I have no idea what kind of medical debt this is going to pile on them.  \n\nTo be clear.  I am not suggesting at all that he just call off the wedding.

Adding physical disabilities like OP suggested, even more. \n\nHere in Australia we have good public healthcare, but even with that my health costs are astronomical. My husband has stood by me through it all, but I do wonder how much more financially stable he would have been if he had chosen to stay. The mental toll as well.\n\nLike you, I think it's fair to present the facts. Although, maybe OP should have waited longer, until she was safely out of the hospital.

If they were already married then that would be a non-issue, and divorcing wouldn\u2019t undo those burdens.  The lifestyle issues are real and exist, but those are not what marriage is locking in.  I believe that is why OP is suggesting his son consider the marriage, rather than saying he shouldn\u2019t marry her.  Right now they\u2019re financially and legally uncoupled, it may make more sense for them to stay together but unmarried rather than tying the two of them together legally and having the medical debt be an insurmountable obstacle for the both of them.  It may be that OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 qualifies for government assistance and aid while single that she may not if she is married, that OP\u2019s son could provide for them better if his finances weren\u2019t legally tied to hers, etc.\n\nThese are things that can be explored and weighed prior to marriage, but immediately after marriage are a moot point.

We treat it like taking turns, based on how much he can do. Even though his support for me is optional and my support for him is required, it feels equal and that makes it a relationship between equals, not a caregiver and carer relationship.

It\u2019s not about \u201cthinking if we can take care of them\u201d.", "In another comment they mentioned she lost her uterus and ovaries among other organs.", "A spine is absolutely involved in having children", "So by your definition every single person who ever called of or postponed a wedding, no matter the reason, is an asshole?", "Medical benefits, tax benefits", "NTA for suggesting it but WBTA if OP kept pressuring Son.  I understand.  Carer for two family members with disabilities here.  I think it's important for Son to get a handle on what's involved in financee's care and make an informed judgement re: marriage. Being a full time carer/partner for someone with significant disabilities is a lifelong, life changing commitment.  Everyone is in trauma over the accident atm.  A delay would not only benefit Son but also the Fiancee so that she doesn't feel down the line that it was a \"pity marriage\" or a marriage of obligation.  Also please give financee time to medically heal and both parties time to adjust to the new lifestyle and then be able to plan and enjoy a wedding/honeymoon that will be different to what was originally organised/imagined.  Life changing injuries such as these take a long, long, time to adjust to, there is grieving over what could have been, frustration over new limitations and lots of plain hard, exhausting work.", "I might have missed when the wedding is supposed to take place. I think that affects my judgement. My cousin\u2019s wife was diagnosed bi-polar when he was planning to propose. I advised him to take some time to learn about what her needs are and seriously consider if he was willing to meet those needs long term. I suggested that it wasn\u2019t fair to either of them if he wasn\u2019t proactive in that way. He took the time to do so and decided to propose. \n\nAdvising someone to seriously and honestly consider their capacity of being a good partner before getting married isn\u2019t an AH move, but depending on when the wedding is planned, they may already have sufficient time to take those steps and decide to continue or cancel.", "Absolutely no one said that nor suggested that. It's clear from your responses now that you aren't interested in accepting your judgment.", "In July and reading through ops comments the injuries include traumatic brain injuries that tie to memory loss and some personality changes, in addition to limb loss, spinal damage and significant internal damage. The brain damage alone is enough for me to suggest NTA. The person she was may or may not return. Is the son marrying the memory of who she was, or the incredibly strong fighter who has along road to a new normal ahead", "Exactly! Thank you for understanding as I\u2019ve been downvoted even though I\u2019m coming from the place of a disabled person.", "As someone with bipolar I find this very insulting. I've had bipolar for a long time, it's not like it pops up over night. The challenges you face with bipolar they would've been dealing with already even before a diagnosis was reached. The fact that they received a diagnosis means that most likely things would start to get better, not worse, because they can start to build a support system instead of just dealing with the highs and lows as they come.", "You would also be aware that symptoms of bi-polar can become more prevalent in your early 20s, which is how old they were when this happened. You would also know that there are different types and severity of bi-polar. My cousin was struggling because he loves her, he loved her then and he was doubting if he could be a good partner to her long-term. \n\nHe had been around her mom, who has severe symptoms and he worried that he couldn\u2019t handle those same hurdles well long-term. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you find offensive my advice that he learn more about what she needs so that he could go into marriage informed and having made an educated commitment rather than basing it off her mom who has a different experience."]}
