Soft YTA. \n\nIf you drop the gift off, let it be with an apology note", "Ooh, if you RSVP\u2019d yes, lost track of your calendar, and failed to correct your RSVP with the bride, yes, YTA.  You can\u2019t correct numbers when you don\u2019t know, which means she paid for your attendance even though you weren\u2019t coming.  With how expensive weddings are, it really sucks when that happens.  Would\u2019ve cost me about $120 per person, and that was a dry wedding almost 5 years ago.", "Yes, YTA. You RSVP\u2019d and then texted her after the fact. It\u2019s possible someone else didn\u2019t get an invite because you did.", "YTA for double booking. Which would be an honest mistake but \u2026\n\nI N F O: did you tell her as soon as you realised? This reads like you realised, didn\u2019t know how to approach it with her, and so just didn\u2019t show then texted her afterwards.

People pay a lot of money for every person at their wedding, you really think that\u2019s not just outright rude behaviour to not show and not tell her? I\u2019m not surprised she didn\u2019t respond to you I\u2019d be pissed at you as well.", "YTA for waiting until *the day of the wedding* to tell her you can't make it when you knew at least 2 weeks in advance.", "So then she paid for your meal and you didn't show up because of a vacation you knew about in advance. \n\nA) no matter the rate for her gown she referred other business and you made money from those referrals. \n\nB) I have no idea about the value of your gift but my wedding gift is at least the cost of my dinner plus some.  She didn't really ask for the embroidery so you don't even know if she wants it so the standard \"guest rules\" don't really apply to your gift.  \n\nC) even if it did.  You still left her in a position to be out of pocket money because you apparently didn't check your day planner?\n\nETA: YTA", "Ah soft YTA because you didn't tell her before. But you were such a big help with her wedding, she may not stay mad at you for long (what she paid for your attendance is probably way less that what she should have paid someone else for your work).\n\nMay I add that your gift is absolutely wonderful.", "You knew for two weeks and still didn\u2019t say anything until the day/s afterwards?\n\nYTA. Hugely.", "YTA - who RSVPs yes for a wedding and doesn\u2019t show up or tell the couple in advance their plans changed?

You don\u2019t have to mix your work with your personal life!", "NTA and your gift sounds like such a beautiful keepsake.", "Were you officially invited or was it assumed?\n\nEither way NTA.

You don't have any obligation to go to a cluents wedding. Why did you even get a gift?", "NTA- You did a job for her and the people in the wedding.
