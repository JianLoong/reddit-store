We just found out we are having a baby recently, so we\u2019ve been happy about everything. \n\nAbout two years into our relationship, I accidentally met her half-sister, I\u2019ll call her Anne. Who was born from an affair. It was at a baseball game. This girl who looked exactly like my gf came up to us and introduced herself to me and tried telling my gf about her upcoming graduation and that she wanted us to go. My gf declined everything and told Anne to not speak to her. On our way home, she told me about her father\u2019s affair with this woman when she was only five. That she had a half-sister that she never liked. I asked her if she if ever tried to get to know Anne, she said no. \n\nI never had contact with Anne within the next two years until I seen her singing in some subway station on my way to work. She noticed me and asked if I wanted to get coffee which I agreed. I asked her why she was singing in the subway station, she told me she was getting by and that she was living in a hotel room nearby. I had to leave early due to my work and gave her my number to keep in contact with me. So we did keep in contact with each other, I got her a job at a friend\u2019s hair salon and I helped her get an apartment. I told her about the pregnancy and we are becoming first time parents, she was happy for the both of us. \n\nAnne must\u2019ve seen her sister in public because she congratulated her on the pregnancy. My gf hated that she knew and that she didn\u2019t want me near her again. I was given an ultimatum, to stop all contact with Anne or leave my pregnant gf. \n\nI only felt bad for Anne because I was homeless at a young age and seen a lot of me in her.

You know your GF doesn't want anything to do with Anne why did you feel the need to have a relationship with Anne? \n\nI don't believe for a moment that you go to coffee, help with employment and exchange phone numbers with every homeless person you see in the subway, why THIS particular girl?   Especially when you knew your GF wouldn't want that.    \n\nHave you no loyalty?   Your GF doesn't want yet another avenue open to Anne to get into her life.   Why did you feel the need to pave the highway?    \n\nYes, you are the AH for keeping in contact with a person who MEANT NOTHING TO YOU but you still build a relationship with knowing your GF wouldn't want it.", "I think these will lead to a divorce... Your gf is hurt because her dad cheated her mom, and she doesn't want to have a relationship with the sister that was born from that cheating, and you ignore your gf feelings over a stranger.... that is not something you should be doing.....\n\nnext update will be \"I am now a single father\"", "YTA \n\nYour girlfriend made it super clear that this was a boundary for her. \n\nYou\u2019ve gotten yourself involved to a degree that goes way beyond \u201ckeeping in contact\u201d, which would\u2019ve already been crossing a line.", "INFO: Is your gf still in contact with her father?", "YTA, you did that behind her back.... dude, she is about to have your child. You should be putting them first... not causing her stress, which could affect your baby.", "YTA, clearly the affair is a sore point for your girlfriend and you went behind her back and dismissed her boundaries", "Such a huge breach of trust against your partner. YTA. Sure we can all say OP has the right to make his own decisions blah blah blah. But had the OP been honest with the GF I would've agreed however you went behind her back. It's almost as if you cheated on her with the product of a cheater. I'm sure that's the way she sees it.  Even though it's not half sisters fault she was born. OP You knew it felt wrong so you omitted telling her which is as good as a lie.  Now she's pregnant and feels that the one person she could trust is no longer there.  I don't know if there's any redemption for your relationship.", "YTA. Your gf made it very clear that she wanted nothing to do with Anne. So much so that she gave you an ultimatum (WHILE PREGNANT). In the grand scheme of things, sure, talking to someone your partner does not like should not be SUCH a big deal. There are many more factors in THIS particular situation but let\u2019s just focus on one part for a moment. Think about it like this, she would sacrifice your entire relationship \u2014 which means forgoing the support she would get financially, emotionally, mentally, AND physically from you guys being together \u2014 rather than accept you communicating with someone else. Not only that, but she would rather be a single mom and face the struggles that come with that than accept you communicating with someone else. BUT ADDITIONALLY, this is not just ANYONE, it\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t like your old friend from high school or one of your friends who makes bad jokes. Though, her half sister is not at fault, she IS STILL though unfortunately, a hurtful reminder of very personal matters to her. AND ON TOP OF THAT, you LIED to her. You lied to her, over and over and over again, every time you had contact with her sister. This is someone you would have never known if it wasn\u2019t for your gf. She should not even exist in your circle of people, ESPECIALLY after your gf made it explicitly clear she wanted nothing to do with them. Sure, you felt bad for the girl, but more importantly, you divulged personal matters of your gfs to someone who shouldn\u2019t have had access to any part of her life in the first place. In conclusion: (1) you overstepped your gf\u2019s boundaries, (2) invalidated her, (3) violated her privacy to someone who does not respect her \u2014 bc I\u2019m sure at this point the sister KNOWS what your gf\u2019s boundaries are, (4) and you lied. Yes, YTA. Maybe you didn\u2019t mean to be an AH, but intent does not excuse impact.", "YTA you\u2019re betraying you GF and you didn\u2019t just help Anna you have personal information you knew your gf wouldn\u2019t have wanted to know. You need to cut all contact with Anna and focus on your gf and your baby. You really screwed up.", "YTA.\n\nYou should have discussed this with your girlfriend. If you don\u2019t approve of her treatment of her sister, you discuss it with her. You\u2019ve been lying to her for ages and have easily done this. It makes you untrustworthy.", "Did you ask Anne if she contacted her dad for help? Oh wait, that's right, you said you saw yourself inside of Anne. No wonder you hid your relationship with her from your pregnant girlfriend. Your girlfriend's dad probably hid her, too.", "As someone who recently dealt with homelessness, helping her get back on her feet was morally the best thing you could have done. A lot of people on here will not be able to understand the feeling of, \"I went through pure hell, and I'll be damned if I abandon anyone else to it.\" So on that, I say you're fine.\n\nHOWEVER, you should not have kept in touch with her past that. She shouldn't know details of your and your girlfriend's private lives.\n\nIf you haven't been homeless, you won't be able to understand the first part. But my guy, you stayed *friends* with her.\n\nYTA.", "YTA Your relationship with the half-sister is suspicious. You are going to extremes for a stranger, and keeping it secret because you know you are in the wrong. You gf has made this boundary abundantly clear and you continue to cross it. What is your end goal here?", "ESH. Your girlfriend for being more angry at the innocent child of an affair than the person who actually had the affair.\n\nYou for the secrecy and disregarding your girlfriend's wishes. You knew already that your girlfriend had very negative feelings about this girl and didn't want her in her life in any way. So you go out of your way to develop a close relationship with said girl (the secrecy part) and tell her medical information about your girlfriend (disregarding her wishes). You don't get to decide to share someone else's medical information without their consent.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have kept your contact with Anne secret for so long. It\u2019s the lying/hiding that makes you TA.", "YTA families are difficult and your gf told you her boundaries with hers and you went behind her back.", "You went out for coffee with her estranged half sister? Why would you do that? If you met any other girl you didn't know and she invited you out for coffee would you go? If the person I was with met up with another girl he didn't know and gave her his number I'd assume he was trying to cheat, and this was someone she knew and didn't want any contact with. I hope this woman is more important than the mother of your child because she's gonna leave you if you keep this up.

Sounds like you have a choice --> pick one and live with it!", "YTA", "'This girl who looks exactly like my GF'\nYou sound creepy maintaining this relationship a secret.", "Yta. You went behind her back and if she doesn\u2019t trust you then it will be on you for doing something she told you not to. You suck!", "Yta", "NTA, because I disagree with the reason for estrangement.\nThose bleating about crossing your girlfriend's boundaries can kick rocks; if there's an AH here it's your girlfriend, for shunning and shaming her half-sister. I think you suspect that, given that you've kept in touch with Anne. \nNobody is ever an ass for being nice.\nIf your unnamed girlfriend wants to shame and shun someone, perhaps it should be the daddy who couldn't keep his trousers up.", "YTA. You went behind your girlfriend\u2019s back with information she told you in confidence.", "ESH because obviously you want to help a young woman in need, but I think you've too far over the line now. Everyone saying that Ur the Asshole are weird! She has dome nothing wrong except  be the product of an affair. She's a young woman who was homess, and he helped her.", "NTA, what's that thing they say about sins of the parents?\n\nYes, I get your GFs reasoning, and it is a little suspect you talking to her dad's love child behind her back. \n\nBut I also am of the mind that shit happens for a reason, and you were supposed to help this girl and do the right thing despite her parents misgivings. Even though the right thing in this situation is wrong to someone else, it's still tips the scale more in the right thing to do.", "Can you read the writing on this wall? It may not be fair or equitable, but it\u2019s the way it is now.", "NTA.  You seem like a really kind person, but your gf does not.  None of what their father did was Anne's fault.  Not wanting to be close with her herself is fine, but I feel like demanding you never speak to her again is unreasonable.", "NAH it's not like you sought her out.. you found her and helped her. It was very kind and a good person activity.  Maybe you should have told gfriend then but i also echo an earlier poster that why would your gfriend still have contact with her dad vs the child/ her sister.", "I just got out of a situation in which I was homeless for about a year, so the last two sentences really hit home for me. I might receive hate, but I'll just say that in my opinion YNTA. I totally understand and agree with everyone that your girlfriends boundaries are extremely important, and even more so now that she's carrying your child, but maybe just cut contact with Anne, explaining to her that you wanted to make sure she was safe and had a good outlook for her future, but that in order to remain in a good relationship with your girlfriend, having contact or a relationship right now is not the best idea. Make sure your girlfriend knows you have cut contact and that you do prioritize her and your baby over anything, but maybe down the line when tensions have settled you can explain to her a bit more how it felt being a young homeless person and how you just wanted to do something you felt was a good thing in your heart.", "NAH. It's clear that you have good intentions and empathize with Anne due to your own experiences. You wanted to help her and be supportive, which is commendable. However, your girlfriend's feelings towards her half-sister are also understandable, given the history of the affair and its impact on her family. It's a difficult situation for everyone involved.\n\nIt's important to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your relationship with Anne and why you feel the need to help her. Make it clear that you don't want to cause any harm or discomfort to your girlfriend, but that your empathy for Anne's situation has driven you to want to support her. Ultimately, you will need to decide if maintaining a relationship with Anne is worth potentially jeopardizing your relationship with your girlfriend, especially with a baby on the way. Keep in mind that you are starting a family together, and it's crucial to prioritize your partner's feelings and work together to find a solution that works for both of you.", "NTA- This sounds exactly like something I would do. The estranged sister isn't at fault for your girlfriends fathers affair. As u pointed out, she has never even tried to get to know her as a person. I think your girlfriend definitely had a right to be upset about the affair but never to take it out on an innocent \"child\" that resulted from ir. After all they are sisters. She may not want have anything to do with her and I can see where she would get angry for u helping her but in the end her hangup is about the affair not a child, now adult that resulted from it. I would be that partner that saw it ur way. Because of what u have experienced (so have I) U can't bear to see \"family\" in that situation if u can help. Especially if they don't deserve to be hated on. Kuddos to u. I know not many people would agree, but u did the right thing. I highly doubt ur pregnant girlfriend should or would leave u over this. It's just a threat.", "NTA. It\u2019s OK to help people.", "NTA", "NTA unless there is abuse involved it\u2019s messed up that one partner forbids the other partner from being in contact with anyone whatsoever.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to question your gf\u2019s integrity and humanity that she is ok with cutting off someone innocent so easily.", "NTA at the moment but would suggest you should stop talking to Anne or you will become TA.

The GF should not be forced into a relationship with someone due to the sins of her father either. Not having a relationship with an effective stranger is not a punishment to the affair child.

But that\u2019s not the issue. The issue is that when you\u2019re in a relationship you should be partners, especially if you\u2019re going to be parents. There should be trust and an understanding that you can count on each other. OP hid this from his gf bc he knew she wouldn\u2019t like it.

If he completely ignored her as his callous sister would have wanted him to, she'd probably still be a vulnerable young woman greatly at risk living on the street and out of hotels- assuming she could scrounge enough up for a room that night.  If his girlfriend can't get over herself to realise how serious housing insecurity is and how much more that matters than her feelings, then yeah, she can just go fuck herself. If she can't even empathise with her after knowing OP's history of homelessness then she doesn't deserve empathy in return. Not even a little."]}
