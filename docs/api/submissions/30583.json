And they are in their fifties, so their bad decisions can\u2019t be excused by old age either. They need to step up and act like the adults they are.", "NTA. They need to figure out their finances on their own. Sell one of their properties and live on those proceeds", "NTA. They seem to think they are entitled to your money.  If they were destitute, looking at being on the streets, things would be different.  However, if they are able bodied, they are able to get jobs and go back to work.  Their foolish decisions are not your responsibility.  You have honored your parents by helping them.  However, no one knows when the real estate market will get to a point that they feel comfortable selling it may not get there in their lifetime. So, I would simply say that your own savings goals for retirement are being impacted by helping them and it is time for you to look after your own future.", "NTA. \n\nSaving money allowed them to retire early.

Sounds like they need to go get jobs in the meantime.", ">Worth noting that despite losing all of their cash, they still have quite a sizable real estate portfolio.\n\nCan they not use those as assets for loans?

In one case, they have plenty of options they aren't pursuing. In the other, they are such a financial bind that a bank with professional underwriters won't trust them to pay it back, so you certainly can't...\n\nThey are your parents, and it can be hard to say no, but you are NTA for doing so. It would just be enabling them to make further bad choices with money, no doubt.", "NTA. It's your money you can do with it what you want. Just like it's their money and they did with it what they wanted.", "Tell them to get a line of credit like other rich, cash poor people", "Sorry but if they were to have to sell real estate at a loss now, they haven't invested wisely, or were these properties all bought in the past couple of years? Is it possible that the scammer investment advisor totally lied about the value of your parents' nest egg, and that your parents had a totally inflated idea of their nest egg?\n\nNTA . It sounds like they have had some bad luck/been scammed, and that's terrible, but their are also choosing to not help themselves by refusing to sell some of their assets. Why aren't they going back to work, they are only in their late 50's. Most people have to work at least until 65 if not nearer to 70, so I don't see why they can't go back to work (even if it's a totally different job, and/or if it's only part time or just one of them working right now, etc).\n\nYou are not the ahole at all for not wanting to keep lending money to them when they refuse to live on their own means. They HAVE assets, they just don't want to sell for whatever they think they can now get for it. Why not rent out these premises to get money? It's totally unreasonable for them to keep asking you for money indefinitely until the local economy picks up and they feel they can make a profit that they are happy with (on their assets). This could easily take 1-5 years depending on their expectations, IF reality will ever match their expectations. What if 5 years from now their assets are not yet worth as much as your parents want, will they still refuse to sell, will they continue to expect you to fund their costs of living? How much money will you have lent them by then and how will you ever get that back? Depending on how much money you lend them every month and whether the asset(s) they might sell are owned outright or still have a mortgage, will there be anything left to fully repay you? What if you lend them 30k a year for the next 5 years, even if you are generous and aren't expecting any interest back on this, this is 150k that they will need to pay you back. What if the only asset they are willing to sell after these 5 years is a 300k home they still owe the bank 200k on? Then they end up with a bag of money of 100k, which isn't even enough to pay you back let alone be accessible money they can use to live off of. And you know what, you shouldn't even have to think about their finances in this much detail because they should figure their own stuff out. Also, imagine what YOU could have done with all the money you are lending them, you could have bought a bigger house or an additional property, you could have invested, or put it in a savings account, used it for professional development or to take a career break to get back to school, or spend it on your wedding or kids, or savings for your future child's college fund, etc.", "NTA.  So what excuse do they have for not going out and getting a job to support themselves.  You are not a bank.", "NTA- and I would just tell them- hey- I'm losing a ton in opportunity cost to loan you cash to prop up your investments. That's cash I no longer have that is not available to support my own portfolio. I'm not sure why I should give up my investment opportunities in order to support yours.  So I'm not. You have access to liquidity via other means.", "NTA. Mom was scammed by financial advisor? Are they going after him/the company for recovery? \n\nSo far they are just expecting you to give them cash with nothing in return. Nah.", "NTA. It sounds like they were really good with money and now are being totally reckless. You have no obligation to jump into that mess. You would just be throwing money away at this point. \n\nThey have a lot of options. Sell some or all of their real estate, downsize and live off the rent I'm assuming they're earning from the real estate, and/or GET JOBS. They need to learn to live with the means they now find themselves in.", "If they're in their fifties... they might be trying to pull the \"take care of your elders\" thing and swing an early retirement.  If you're in the kind of family/culture that does that, they're probably starting early.  \n\nIf not, and you don't want to help them, that's fine - just don't ask them for anything either later down the road, 'cos you know it'll be an issue. \n\nI'm gonna go with NTA, just because you're putting your foot down doesn't make you an AH.
