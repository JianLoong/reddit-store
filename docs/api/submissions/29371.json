Four years into a relationship is not the time to bring up future plans that differ greatly from what your partner of 4 years has said they want. That's \"you've committed to me now so I'm going to go against everything you said you want in the expectation you give in\" territory. It's manipulative and unacceptable. You're only 26, if that isn't the future you want say no and leave and find someone who'll support what you want while you support what they want and with some compromise you build a mutually happy ever after. It's not easy to leave someone after 4 years especially if it feels like one minor disagreement but this is one major lifestyle incompatibility that he's gambling on you giving into due to 4 years of a good relationship.\n\nHe's told you what he'll accept for the next 40 or 50 years, you don't have to accept it or consider your 4 years together a waste if you don't. You do need to enjoy the rest of your life and that's a lot longer than 4 years.", "NTA If his mindset on these issues changed this fast, he has 1) Fell down a rabbit hole of \u201calpha male\u201d social media accounts.2) Talked to relatives or friends who are trying to change his mindset 3) Never was a fan of you working and was waiting to spring this on you. \nBe glad you got to see this BEFORE you married him.", "NTA\n\nIt unfortunately sounds like he was just stringing you along in letting you believe he *wasn't* like this.

A dude like this is not a good person to be with if he believes once you get married he's going to become \"man of the house\" and you will become a housewife with no job and instead focus on childcare even when you've both agreed you wanted to be child free in the past. And him running to his room and then running to tell his mom on you is incredibly immature and honestly a huge red flag.\n\nI would text his mother exactly what happened and if he wants to use his mom to communicate then let her know that unfortunately due the the fact that her son and you no longer have the same future goals (having children, and you being a housewife plus whatever else he said) that you will no longer be able to see him.", "NTA\n\nYour BF has either changed his mind or lied to you all along in hopes that once you're in a relationship he could change *your* mind.  I'm guessing the latter to be honest because views like these don't just spring up out of nowhere.  Isn't gaslighting fun?
