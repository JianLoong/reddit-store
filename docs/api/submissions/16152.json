As for appreciating the historical figure, I\u2019m not sure how to go about doing that or if I even should since he\u2019s a genocidal maniac", "Lol", "Yeah, I\u2019m from a different Asian culture and I\u2019ve noticed in most cases a lot of Asian cultures don\u2019t care or even find it kind of cool when western people share in the culture", "No and no. Doing either of those things would make it harder to take liberties with the story so I\u2019m making them an original character in a unique setting", "you're confusing cultural appropriation with things like acculturation, assimilation, or cultural appreciation. All well defined concepts you can easily look up.", "weak troll", "> My point is you're asking a group for advice that is not primarily Asian or Chinese\n\nFair enough, although it\u2019s odd to assume Asian people wouldn\u2019t be on Reddit.", "No, it\u2019s going to be in a fantasy world that takes inspiration from a grab bag of real world cultures. Some aspects Chinese, some Indian, some Mongol, some Persian.", "Who said I\u2019m not from a minority culture? Weird assumption. \n\nAnd as I said in the OP, I *am* making a fantasy culture", "\"A person not of a minority culture, specifically one that gets discriminated against where said person lives, that takes a thing from the minority culture, twists it to suit themself, and then uses it, is, literally, the definition of cultural appropriation.\" People from other minorities can still misappropriate other minorities. No one is immune to it. \n\nThat being said, I don't think OP is necessarily misappropriating the character.", "> especially a negative story, as if it were yours, to use as you please\n\nIsn\u2019t it? He\u2019s a real historical figure, whose actions are well documented. I\u2019m Japanese, if somebody wanted to write a novel about a fictional version of, say, Tojo, I would see no issue with it", "With 1.4 billion people in China alone, can that be considered a minority culture?", "Chinese people are the global majority. What the fuck are you talking about?", "Professionally, I\u2019m an editor. So should I ask myself?", "Yup. Romeo and Juliet is essentially a retelling of Ovid\u2019s Pyramus and Thisbe", "He straight-up dramatized ancient Roman histories:\n\n* Antony and Cleopatra\n* Coriolanus\n* Julius Caesar\n* Titus Andronicus", "Idk I think it could be interesting to have a footnote or something about the real life inspiration for your novel, not to celebrate the figure but to share the inspiration and real world example it was drawn from. Either way not seeing how this is cultural appropriation", "Okay, then my original comment stands.", "Thanks.\n\nDid that.\n\nI still say what OP plans is not cultural appropriation.", "I said most redditors are not Asian.\n\nI think it's easy to concede that most redditors are not Asian. That's not a shocking statement and there are analytics to back it up.", "NTA as long as you properly research and represent the traditions of those respected cultures in your writing.\n\nThat being said, I think I'd consider researching what cultural appropriation looks like in fantasy writing to understand harmful tropes.", "I think Avatar the Last Airbender is a good example of fantasy that blends elements from different cultures while remaining respectful.", "So\u2026 this is genuinely a confusing answer.  Cultural appropriation has been explained, often, as wrong, and for many valid reasons.  Now, suddenly it is ok for minorities to appropriate from one another?  How does that make sense?", "I didn\u2019t say that the person in question is from the majority, only that they live where the minority in question is discriminated against.  They could certainly be of another minority, the way I wrote it (and I just reread it 5 times\u2026). I also don\u2019t mean to suggest it is ok in other places, I\u2019m just describing one situation where it\u2019s very, very clear.", "I was laughing out loud when i read that sentence.", "Not in English speaking countries, they aren\u2019t the majority. And they are discriminated against in them.", "It would be better than asking the people in here tbh", "That sounds like a good idea, thank you for the suggestion", "Someone actually from that culture does tho so....", "> That's not a shocking statement and there are analytics to back it up.\n\nReally?", "Thank you for the advice", "Yeah, it\u2019s a really cool series, I\u2019ll have to rewatch", "Who are responding to?\n\nIf you're responding to me, what I was telling Neenknits is their definition implies that anyone from a minority is immune to misappropriating other cultures. Minorities can still misappropriate other disenfranchised cultures, which is not okay.\n\nHowever, I don't think this is the case with OP.", "I'm saying this phrase \"specifically one that gets discriminated against where said person lives\" is problematic because cultural appropriation isn't defined by the discrimination of another culture. \n\nPeople don't have be defined as a minority culture to misappropriate a culture.", "So, in the US, say, Chinese people are the majority? And aren\u2019t discriminated against?", "True lol", "So? They are not automatically correct  just because it's their culture.", "Sorry, you were right. I was responding to someone else, who claimed that it really isn\u2019t misappropriating if it is a member of a minority doing it to another minority.", "Majority cultures don\u2019t really care, usually, because it doesn\u2019t hurt them.  It would count as punching up.", "I am not in the US.Edit: But that doesn't even matter. China has one of the most ancient and most robust cultures in the world, im sure the Chinese culture won't degrade if someone is getting inspired from it. Quite the opposite actually.", "No, it is unfortunately far too common.", "I agree, but their opinion holds a lot more weight than someone who had to google these concepts five minutes ago.", "Nah you're good. Reddit's reply system gets very confusing.", "I'm not sure what your point is exactly.\n\nThere is some wild miscommunication between cultural appropriation and minorities. They are not mutually exclusive.", "No to which? The sarcastic question of majority, or the truth that they are discriminated against?", "No, no it doesn't.\n\nI knew all those terms. I decided to check to see if I was misunderstanding (or indeed if the definition has altered) and nope, I was right: this is not cultural appropriation at all.  IMHO very few things are, really. Actually I think the whole concept is deeply flawed, perhaps meaningless: I don't see how you draw a line between adopting and embracing part of another culture (good) and something bad which people call \"appropriation\". What's the difference? Blackface is about the only example, and that's not really appropriation anyway.", "Lol I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were to gain a lot of karma with that comment!!", " I can\u2019t think of an example where a majority culture cared if a minority culture used some of their traditions.", "\"I dont think cultural appropriation is a thing that exists\" makes you substantially less qualified than \"I just learned about this concept\"\nYou've also repeatedly demonstrated that you dont actually understand the concept. A chinese person eating a hamburger isnt appropriation lmao", "I agree that those from historically disenfranchised communities and cultures get less publicity, support, and taken seriously. Typically those that aren't from the majority get shat on. \n\nHowever, it doesn't change that cultural appropriation can happen regardless of whether someone is of a majority culture or a minority culture. It is still not okay regardless of who does it."]}
