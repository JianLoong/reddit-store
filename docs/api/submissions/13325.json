She\u2019s the type of person who makes fun of someone for having a hearing aid or wearing glasses. She also says bigoted things (i.e. there was someone on TV wearing a towel turban and Arielle said \u201cEww, why would anyone want to look like a Muslim\u201d) so I do my best to avoid her.\n\nBut Arielle won\u2019t stop reading my diary. I found out because she said I wrote rude things about her cousin Loretta and tried to punish me over it. (I didn\u2019t write anything rude about Loretta, just that she was condescending to me and I didn\u2019t like her comments.) Dad just told me to respect adults and didn\u2019t say anything to Arielle about reading my diary. I\u2019ve moved the diary multiple times but Arielle keeps finding and reading it. She\u2019ll make comments and say things that she would only know about from actively reading my diary. I\u2019ve told my dad and he won\u2019t do anything. He makes an excuse that \u201cOh, you don\u2019t **know** Arielle reads your diary\u201d when she clearly does.\n\nI got fed up with it. So I tried talking to Arielle one more time about respecting my privacy and not reading my diary. I then wrote in my diary that I caught my dad having an affair with our neighbor Michael. Arielle ended up reading my diary the next day and freaked out. She yelled at my dad, went to Michael\u2019s house, yelled at Michael, and then she drove somewhere else.\n\nMy family on my mom and stepdad\u2019s side all thought it was super funny and told me that I taught Arielle an overdue lesson about respecting privacy and not being nosy. But Arielle and my family on my dad\u2019s side are furious with me and I\u2019m still grounded at his house. They said that Arielle is just curious and wants to know what\u2019s going on in my life.

I know that your dad isn't supporting you, and he deserves some of the blame here, but having your partner blow up at you for an affair you didn't have is kind of shitty too.

Have you thought about taking your diary with you or even writing it on your phone?  You need to work on conflict resolution, for the most part, this will not fly in there yet in the adult world.\n\nAs far as the neighbor goes, only in a child's mind would being rude, weird, or giving off bad vibes be a valid reason to destroy a person's reputation.
