Me and my wife stopped trying to tell them they are guests and don't need to do that, but they do. So I just started doing the same when we go over to their house for dinner. It's been a couple of years now and while there is no explanation of the guests cleaning up, no one says anything anymore. \n\nSorry, bit of a tangent there, NTA for your comments, I wouldn't apologize unless your BF really asks you to...your BF seems to be mostly on your side, so I think if he honestly asks you to then it's important to him. That being said, make it a back-handed apology, something along the line of \"out of respect and love for [BF], I apologize for questioning your ypur upbringing. That was wrong of me to assume and I'm sorry\"", "NTA.

Add the bonus of misogyny in chore distribution really tops it off.", "I don't know. I think different cultures call for different comments. I don't mind washing the dishes when going to other people's house because it's what taught in my culture to help the host because they're already tired when they prepared foods for us guest. The host usually never ask and don't let the guest wash, but we just insist on helping them. Usually the dishes are the one that were used to serve us. That's from my Asian culture. I don't know what's their takes on you. Maybe because you're their son's gf.

How long have you been dating? How old are you and your boyfriend?\n\nFor now, ESH- The two of you should set limits openly, in a mature discussion. While your line was hilarious (to us), it sounds like it came more from a moody teenager rather than an adult setting limits.\n\nIt's really important, when you two have these talks, to be a united front, and to behave politely but firmly, and above reproach, so the behavior and responsibility to change is rightfully all  theirs.", "I feel like this one really depends on the ages, extent that you're expected to help and the family dynamic and tone. \n\nI would've probably jumped straight to Y T A but you did mention all the other kids stay away and bf doesn't like to visit, so I guess expectations could indeed be too high. \n\nINFO: without too many details, what kind of reasons does your bf have for not liking to visit? And is your entire time there spent doing chores? \n\nIt also sort of feels like this could be just including you in the family, depending on their dynamic. \n\nIf it's just washing dishes, setting/clearing, and bf helping his parents with a few computer things (my mother can't even turn one on, some people struggle) here and there, soft Y T A, to be revised if it turns out this is slave labour or something. It's pretty normal to help out (offer!) wherever you visit/eat, especially with family or potential family.\n\nEdit: perspective/change of judgement-ish -- I see people pointing out the misogynist split of chores. I didn't click to that straight away as I assumed bf was just called to help doing things he usually helps with and you're filling in help \"gaps\" but that's maybe my internalised crap so yeah there's that too. \n\nI think I'll go with E S H -- you for being a little rude by not offering to assist and making some (retaliatory) remarks, and them for expecting you to do more than you're offering and assigning you those particular chores. \n\nHave you guys all discussed calmly and together why what is expected/how you feel about that/how to go forward?\n\nEdit: spacing", "YTA I always do what ever I can to help out who ever we visit.
