I don't mind washing the dishes when going to other people's house because it's what taught in my culture to help the host because they're already tired when they prepared foods for us guest. The host usually never ask and don't let the guest wash, but we just insist on helping them. Usually the dishes are the one that were used to serve us. That's from my Asian culture. I don't know what's their takes on you. Maybe because you're their son's gf.

While your line was hilarious (to us), it sounds like it came more from a moody teenager rather than an adult setting limits.\n\nIt's really important, when you two have these talks, to be a united front, and to behave politely but firmly, and above reproach, so the behavior and responsibility to change is rightfully all  theirs.", "I feel like this one really depends on the ages, extent that you're expected to help and the family dynamic and tone. \n\nI would've probably jumped straight to Y T A but you did mention all the other kids stay away and bf doesn't like to visit, so I guess expectations could indeed be too high. \n\nINFO: without too many details, what kind of reasons does your bf have for not liking to visit?

It's pretty normal to help out (offer!) wherever you visit/eat, especially with family or potential family.\n\nEdit: perspective/change of judgement-ish -- I see people pointing out the misogynist split of chores. I didn't click to that straight away as I assumed bf was just called to help doing things he usually helps with and you're filling in help \"gaps\" but that's maybe my internalised crap so yeah there's that too. \n\nI think I'll go with E S H -- you for being a little rude by not offering to assist and making some (retaliatory) remarks, and them for expecting you to do more than you're offering and assigning you those particular chores. \n\nHave you guys all discussed calmly and together why what is expected/how you feel about that/how to go forward?\n\nEdit: spacing", "YTA I always do what ever I can to help out who ever we visit.

I know this might sound strange but it is how we share the responsibility of gatherings and it is so appreciated by the host. Just to add we have a few, including my DIL, that didn\u2019t help unless asked to do a specific thing. Now everyone helps. When cleaning up we are all talking, laughing and have a good time.", "Sure, if a not-close friend comes by, then sure.\n\nBut if I'm at my parents house, I'm doing the dishes. If I'm staying with my best friend, I'm walking her dog, and probably making the tea in the morning. My favorite house guests are ones who help make sure the dishes make it back to the kitchen, and I have one friend who cleans when drunk - love having him and his wife stay for the weekend.\n\nNo one is expected to do chores, but the closer you are to the host the more awkward it is to be an additional burden. It is especially painful when the woman does all the work and the husband just sits there talking to you (I'm sure it might happen in reverse as well, but I don't see that among my friends).\n\nI have one friend that throws large weekend long parties, and the rules are clear - you are assigned a meal to cook for everyone, byob and your bedding and towels need to make it to the laundry room before you leave. Frankly, 100% worth it every time.", "Invite them to your house, kick back and relax while they clean.", "If your boyfriend wants to keep going to his parents' house when he doesn't enjoy it because he feels guilty no one else likes them, that is on him. He needs to stop dragging you there. You don't like going there, it's like he seems to think if I \"have\" to go to this place I hate, you do too. Nope. NTA. Stop going.", "NTA. Your boyfriend might obligate himself to visit and work, that's his choice. If I were you I'd have other plans on those days, even if it's just to read or watch Netflix. Don't go. They're ungrateful narcissistic A-holes.", "NTA. In general, if someone else cooked a meal I ate, of course it\u2019s on me to participate in the cleaning. Similarly, before I leave someone\u2019s house I take down the bedsheets I used and make it easy for laundry to happen. basically if I am someone who is benefiting from the work of others, of course I chip in and help them out in return. But, as a host, I would never directly ask someone to help out (yes I would silently judge them if they routinely didn\u2019t help and I would invite them over less or pick a non-home meeting ground for further hangouts). Also, as a host, I would never expect a guest to help out more than my own family members (is the younger brother a child under 10? He should be helping). It\u2019s primarily the double standards in BFs family that make you NTA.", "NTA.  Why are you going over there?  Let your BF go over to fix the computer by himself.  And when you do end up going especially don\u2019t eat dinner there.  It is hard to ask you to clean up when you don\u2019t eat.", "NTA. They\u2019re guilt tripping him and you. Boundaries need to be set.", "There's a name for women who don't know how to say no. LOL", "NTA, actually you shouldn't be helping them. You are a guest, you are being invited over, and being treated like Cinderella.\n\nLike the whole dynamic being that because you're a woman who is having sex with their son you are now a maid is them saying that you are lower in rank. There shouldn't be ranks.\n\nBut I think we actually need to look at is that despite you saying you didn't want to go, your boyfriend has pressured you to go. He knows his parents treat you badly, and is now asking you to apologize. He isn't actually on your side", "NTA but also, how do I get everyone I know to come over and do my chores for me...", "ESH After a huge family meal hosted by my Mother we always pitched in to help clean up, do dishes, etc. My Mom would cook a meal for 10 to 15 people and we had no dishwasher. It would have been rude to leave her with the mess. I would not expect my BF or GF to help out on her first few visits. They would be considered guests, until they were accepted as a member of the family.\n\nIt wasn't expected to clean the bathroom or mow the lawn though. It was just cleaning up after the dinner.", "Indeed, but it sounds like she's trying to eat it to preserve the relationship with the dude. Which is a problem because he's the one letting his parents treat her like this", "I mean at least you need to move a thousand miles away, since he's still asking you to apologize after letting his parents treat you like this..", "On her first time meeting them?", "Well, they put her to work the first time she met them and then she was for sure a guest. No, they are just assholes.", "Did you help the first day you met your in-laws?", "Indeed, they were just looking for their son to bring in a maid that they don't have to pay.", "I would be horribly embarrassed if my guests performed domestic labor that they shouldn't be doing. It's just plain bad hosting, whether it's a guest to your home or a graduation party.", "You need to go 100% NC and no effort with them.", "NTA. \n\nThat whole respect your elders crap always gets me because it\u2019s invariably used for manipulation and implies that you owe them something. You don\u2019t. You\u2019re not a member of their family (yet), so you don\u2019t need to contribute to maintenance of their household. Even if you were their child, you don\u2019t live with them, so you\u2019re a guest and should be treated like one. Helping out in another\u2019s home should always be optional. \n\nYour boyfriend probably needs to go to therapy. Somehow they\u2019ve convinced him that it\u2019s on him to compensate for them driving away their other children and, again, it\u2019s not. His guilt is inappropriate and it\u2019s likely he didn\u2019t come to that conclusion on his own. \n\nYou may want to apologize if you intend on having a committed, long term relationship with your boyfriend, but you both need to set boundaries with these people. And if they continue to push regardless, good riddance to them both.", "NTA. \n\nStop visiting. \n\nA dear adopted aunty used to say \"What did your last slave die of? Overwork?\" You owe them no more than common courtesy, not a full day of working for them. Just stop visiting.", "Tell me this OP; do you think their passive aggressive comments are socially appropriate?\n\nNTA.", "I'm going to assume they don't ACTUALLY want you guys visiting. My aunt used to do this to us. \nI don't visit not even for a minute anymore.", "NTA, but OP, there\u2019s a simple solution to this:  stop going over there.  Just stop.", "NTA got half way through and it was obvious his parents are entitled control freaks I didn't even finish reading. No one should be expected to work when a guest in someone else's home. If the don't want to clean the mess and make sure everything is running smoothly they shouldn't host. PERIOD I would and have left family gathering because my grandma didn't think a young man should be sitting and enjoying himself and that I should be constantly working.", "Honestly if I were OP, I would just stop visiting the parents with him.", "There\u2019s a difference between helping out with cleanup from a shared meal or serving (something I\u2019ve always been taught to do) and just taking on projects the moment you step through the door.\n\nAs well, generally when one does host-adjacent chores, the host does them as well, and usually they\u2019re kinda fun/bonding (fond memories of hanging around the kitchen with my mom & grandma).\n\nSounds like OP\u2019s inlaws are just assigning tasks with their feet up while complaining.", "She's a guest. They bought her a set of gloves so that she can wash all of the dishes when she visits! Setting and clearing the dishes is one thing, but expecting her to do ALL of the dishes is another.", "But they're not *her parents* or *her friends.*\n\nOffering to help out when you arrive as a guest is at most a gesture, but it's largely customary and mostly not expected as something that will entail follow through.\n\nThis situation and say, helping with dishes after a group meal aren't comparable when you consider the parents constantly making passive aggressive snipes in order to get guilted labor out of their son and his girlfriend. Do you *really*, in your heart of hearts, believe the parents treat every house guest they entertain this way or just the ones over which they have a power imbalance to leverage?", "Why was there a second visit in the first place?", "Just a quick question when's the last time they came over and did your dishes or chores? If the answer is never then return the same courtesy and tell them family needs to help family.", "NTA. Stop going over there.", "Well, now you know why they don\u2019t have many friends and their other kids don\u2019t talk to them\u2026", "NTA. If your BF wants to work, he can visit his parents by himself.", "Is your bf Korean?", "NTA\n\nFamily is so deeply strange, every dynamic is different, yadda yadda. The dynamic of this sounds genuinely baffling; who has a first-time visitor doing dishes?! To the point of that interaction though, there is a clear difference in hierarchy. They are expecting and demanding consideration and reverence for being your partner's parents and older, but their manners are cheap. If they're going to make condescending, judgemental comments they need to prepare for a rejoinder. You are not visiting because you need their company or assistance, it's the reverse and maybe some time away could help put it into perspective.", "NTA\n\nThe whole situation is weird though. Why would your bf ask them to allow both of you, adults, to do something? Or not to do something?\n\nWhy do you feel obligated to go there with him? You don't like them, they are passive agressive to you, you want to rest in your day off. So tell him that and stop going.\n\nIt is up to him if he wants to go, work, being bossed around or do whatever. It is his problem, not yours.", "NTA and good one! Just don't go over there! If your guy wants to suffer let him.", ">Props for the use of \"self-flagellation\".  Love it!", "<< treated as , well, a guest>>  \nI also think it depends on the situation.\n\nIt sounds like this is a regular thing with a normal meal.--in that case I'd never allow a guest to help wash dishes, etc.  I might let them take their dishes to sink.  \n\nHowever, if it was a big holiday type meal, I definitely would not turn down help as the number of dishes and hours of work was likely quite tiring.  Again it's: would not turn down.  I wouldn't be handing out dish gloves and saying get to work.", ">This isn't what's happening here.

In my family it's quite common to help - at the very least - setting/clearing the table. Depending on how many people are visiting and how large the gathering is. If my aunt spent the whole day cooking, it's certainly expected for the rest of us to do the dishes, clean up the kitchen and so. \n\nSame with close, friendly gatherings. If there's a lot of dishes, some people help out by doing the dishes. The only difference is that no one is making passive-agressive coments like OP's MIL is. It's just an unspoken social rule, and you won't be seen as rude if you don't do it every time you visit (except with family, but that varies).", "I got the part that brother didn't help, and BF did other chores.

Much easier if you don't want anyone to lift a finger.\n\nAnyways, we aren't going to agree, but that is okay because we aren't friends and I'm not having you over to my home.\n\nCheers", "NTA. When I have guests over, all I do is expect them to respect my stuff and not trash my place. Otherwise than that, it is on me for the chores.

However, everyone deserves to be treated politely until respect is earned or their  behaviour is out of order.\n\nWhen visiting family, and social visits, there should not be expectation of doing a whole load of tasks, people can be a good guest and help with things like washing, basic clearing up. \n\nHowever, from what you have said, bf parents don\u2019t see your visits as social visits but more of expectation that you are there to help. If what they want specific help for your bf, that would be separate visits and only if bf wanted to do it. Given that younger brother lives and doesn\u2019t help and overall parents sound entitled just because they had kids, you are definitely NTA.\n\nSounds like his parents are quite toxic as other siblings have it them out. Thinks it\u2019s good that you tried to put boundaries in place and if they listen or change, it would be fair to say you won\u2019t visit. It will be up to your bf what he decides but he should feel responsible for to support them because other refuse contact.\n\nFamilies should about love, respect, support and trust, if this is all one sided, he has right if he choices to cut contact with them and they have to live consequences of their own actions", "NTA  It\u2019s normal to have a few small things to ask for help on, light bulb change, computer issues, or moving a heavy object.", "I stayed with my boyfriends family when covid hit because I couldn\u2019t fly into New York and we couldn\u2019t stay in our college town.\n\nThey always insisted I didn\u2019t have to help much, but appreciated getting my help like once a month on Saturdays to tidy up.

Of course I\u2019m going to do everything I can to express my gratitude!\n\nIf you were going over there every single day for dinner and refused to lift a finger that would be one thing.

My partner\u2019s family expects all family members (partners also count as family), regardless of gender, to help set the table and clean after dinner by doing dishes, wiping the table down etc, non-related guests aren\u2019t expected to help. I did dishes the first time I met my partner\u2019s fam. In my family, partners and non-related guests aren\u2019t expected to help, but my partner usually helps anyway. I have been to houses where hosts seem offended if I offer to help. I\u2019ve also been to houses where hosts seem offended if I don\u2019t help. I find in cases of culture clash, a little extra graciousness and understanding on both sides helps, and in this situation, I\u2019d say probably both sides could be a bit more gracious and understanding. Ex: Bf parents could stop asking for so many favors and learn to do things like computer troubleshooting themselves, OP can get over putting out some utensils and doing a few dishes after eating a meal that someone else made for them.
