You say you walked in at 10:30, they closed at 11, but it took you so long to check out that the employee had time to come over, argue with you to the point of wanting to get a police officer (No easy feat, because the closers at Wal-Mart have seen some shit) and then time for them to go, find the cop, bring the cop back, and the cop to decide it was easier to arrest you than to just let you finish and leave.  \n\n\nHow could someone take that long to check out, when they only have the amount of merchandise they could pick up in 30 minutes?  Speaking as someone who worked retail...  \n\n\nCoupons.  Lots and lots of coupons.  Expired coupons, coupons for the wrong products, coupons for other retailers, coupons for numbers of products that are not being purchased, coupons that appear to have been photocopied, coupons that are physically damaged past the point of illegibility.  And a **boundless** determination on the part of the customer to demand that each and every one of them be honored, no matter how long you have to stand there and refuse to move.  \n\n\nSo, in addition to YTA, INFO:  Did you have coupons?", "YTA \n\nI'm not buying your story, it sounds like you are leaving a lot of info out. How many times did they announce that they were closing? (Which you obviously ignored.) How close to closing did you walk into the store? \n\nHow exactly did you react when the employee told you that you couldn't check out? I don't believe for a moment that \" Iwas not aggressive or rude at all nor contributed to any escalation other than telling the employee I would leave once I'm done.\" \n\nAlso, if the employee had time to *go get someone* then you were there for more than a couple of minutes. \n\n>Nonetheless, the cop arrested me without hesitation.\n\nNot how this works. If you get trespassed from a location, the cops give you a written trespass notice and escort you off the property, if you are actually being cooperative. If you were arrested, it was probably because you were being belligerent and refused to accept the trespass.", "YTA.

I get the feeling OP is leaving out every part of the story that makes her look bad.\n\nNo employee is going to go find a cop, for the reasons described in the post. No cop is going to arrest someone who cooperates. My guess is that OP got belligerent, and/or threatened either the employee, the cop, or both. And then refused to leave. Any retail establishment can withhold services if their employees feel, or are, threatened \n\nThe cop asked her to leave, and she refused. After that, there is only one action the cop can take. OP got arrested due to her poor behaviour and her refusal to leave. \n\nThe amount of paperwork that I suspect both the employee and the cop have to complete to record the situation make it very unlikely that this scenario occurred anywhere like OP describes. \n\nThere will be security tapes that show the truth. \n\nYTA. For lying about your role in the AITA post, and for thinking you have the right to delay the employee closing the store.

Your entitlement is disgusting.", "YTA. Closing time means they are closed, not a suggestion to slowly wrap things up.  You were instructed to leave. You refused, like you owned the store.  You were trespassing. Its the against the law to not leave when you were told to.  You broke the law.

I call shenanigans on this story.   Too many holes in the story.", "Just for fun I\u2019m going to fill in the blanks the OP left out.  I\u2019m betting she was slow to get to the registers, she was shopping for WAY more than bone broth, fruits and veggies.  Most people literally fast walk/run to grab what they need when it\u2019s close to closing time out of courtesy for the employees.\n\nOP was then told numerous times to leave after starting check out.  Check out was for a cart load of items and it was probably 10-15 minutes past closing when she started.\n\nOP obviously kept refusing.  Police show up.  Police witness OP being a jerk to the employee.  Police say they need to leave.  OP still acts like a jerk.  OP gets shiny bracelets.  \n\nI\u2019ve lived in Florida.  OP definitely gave the police a reason to arrest her and it was enough for a judge to slap her with a bail amount that required a $1000 bond.\n\nOh and OP YTA.  No way does a polite customer checking out past closing time end up getting arrested for just being there.", "YTA. How many times did they warn you that they were closing and that you wouldn't be able to check out?

He doesn't want to drive you to the station, fill out the paperwork, or deal with an issue that won't go anyway. And he definitely would have given you a warning first. \n\nWalmart workers are some of the least paid in the country, they don't want to deal with you.

Your story is preposterous.\n\nNo way that you didn't leave out some very important details of this story. \n\nI think 300 million people in America will attest how it's extremely hard to be surprised by a WalMart closing as it's not like they close silently. You just ignored a lot of warnings.", "YTA\nThe world doesn't revolve around you.\n\n>it was passed closing.\n\nNo, it was past closing. As in past tense, in the past. They were closed.

There is no way this story happened this way.  I am quite sure they saved all camera footage of you and what happened.    You were not respectful of the stores hours at all.  Once asked to leave and you stay it is trespassing and you can be arrested for it.   I saw your post where you want to sue them.  It doesn't matter your verdict here, the cameras will tell the tale.   So it doesn't matter how you spin it here.  Public opinion does not make the law more or less applicable.   Everything you do at a register- especially self check out is videoed with voice.  It is also date and time stamped.  So it will show when you were there and what time it was.", "There is no way we are getting the entire story here so YTA.", "YTA the store closes when the store closes.

Don't arrest me.\"", "Okay--- let's unpack here (with me a grocery store cashier / sometimes SCO manager)\n\nWe start closing down our checklanes because we are supposed to clock out at a certain time and if we don't we actually do get in trouble or written up for causing extra overtime hours to be used so ONE customer who can't / won't go through a normal register can check out.\n\nOur SCO closes at 11:00pm. We are also scheduled to leave at 11pm. This is where the disconnect lays. Our COPRORATION is telling you the customer that you can check out until x hour but the person minding SCO has X #of checkstands, that you must count the money, do paperwork, etc and turn in BEFORE we clock out at the time we are assigned to clock out. \n\nThis is part of our job.\n\n Having someone sneak up behind your head while you're trying to shut down machines and start checking out 500 dollars worth of groceries is a thing that the suits don't even imagine.\n\nThat SCO cashier could have already gotten in trouble for being too kind to people who want to buy a bazillion dollars in groceries 5 minutes before they close. You don't know until you work there.\n\nMy most recent example was I was working a regular checkstand and was called from upstairs and told to shut down and take my break. I turned my light off and was going to help the next two people in line who had products on the belt already. i went to put the sign up and a lady came crashing out of nowhere and told me she had been standing there for \"hours\" and how I \"had\" to take her.

My friend works retail and had people in the store 30 MINUTES AFTER CLOSING TIME still LOOKING!! She almost missed our meeting because of it.", "We closed early on xmas eve. Had a lady come in and another manager told her to start heading to the front to check out (announcement we closed had gone off already). This lady made a mistake, she went to an associate down the aisle to complain about the manager, the associate dished it out about they had plenty of time to shop and we have families etc. So she went to another associate and same thing. This lady went to 5 associates on her way tone checkout bitching, and each and every person responded the same way telling her to get going. Finally got to the cashier for 1 last vent and the cashier wasn\u2019t having any of it lol.\n\nThis lady lingered outside for 30 mins too after we closed. Normally I\u2019d be more concerned but it was -5 out and this idiot was giving us a negative survey lol.", "All of this. And the inevitable person that used to feel the need either to try to buy all their stuff using small change, or a pack of gum with a large note.

You gotta go\".", "Really - every store I\u2019ve been in - if you are in line to check out or are actively checking out they don\u2019t arrest you.

Friend who still works there told me about the change to the system closing as I thought it still went down at 1 am.", "If it was past closing and she was mid checkout.

However, even if she was checking out before closing, she was asked to leave so it was within the employee\u2019s right to get the officer involved. But I doubt there\u2019s actually a cause to sue, because after being asked to leave, it is technically trespassing. I know it\u2019s not a legal sub, but yeah I think OP was TA for not just, leaving when asked. If the employees wanna make their jobs harder, that\u2019s on them.", "But, since they didn\u2019t kick her out on the dot and even let her check some items out that goes out of the window.
