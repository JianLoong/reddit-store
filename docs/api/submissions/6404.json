You say you walked in at 10:30, they closed at 11, but it took you so long to check out that the employee had time to come over, argue with you to the point of wanting to get a police officer (No easy feat, because the closers at Wal-Mart have seen some shit) and then time for them to go, find the cop, bring the cop back, and the cop to decide it was easier to arrest you than to just let you finish and leave.  \n\n\nHow could someone take that long to check out, when they only have the amount of merchandise they could pick up in 30 minutes?  Speaking as someone who worked retail...  \n\n\nCoupons.  Lots and lots of coupons.  Expired coupons, coupons for the wrong products, coupons for other retailers, coupons for numbers of products that are not being purchased, coupons that appear to have been photocopied, coupons that are physically damaged past the point of illegibility.  And a **boundless** determination on the part of the customer to demand that each and every one of them be honored, no matter how long you have to stand there and refuse to move.  \n\n\nSo, in addition to YTA, INFO:  Did you have coupons?", "YTA \n\nI'm not buying your story, it sounds like you are leaving a lot of info out. How many times did they announce that they were closing? (Which you obviously ignored.) How close to closing did you walk into the store? \n\nHow exactly did you react when the employee told you that you couldn't check out? I don't believe for a moment that \" Iwas not aggressive or rude at all nor contributed to any escalation other than telling the employee I would leave once I'm done.\" \n\nAlso, if the employee had time to *go get someone* then you were there for more than a couple of minutes. \n\n>Nonetheless, the cop arrested me without hesitation.\n\nNot how this works. If you get trespassed from a location, the cops give you a written trespass notice and escort you off the property, if you are actually being cooperative. If you were arrested, it was probably because you were being belligerent and refused to accept the trespass.", "YTA.

I get the feeling OP is leaving out every part of the story that makes her look bad.\n\nNo employee is going to go find a cop, for the reasons described in the post. No cop is going to arrest someone who cooperates. My guess is that OP got belligerent, and/or threatened either the employee, the cop, or both. And then refused to leave. Any retail establishment can withhold services if their employees feel, or are, threatened \n\nThe cop asked her to leave, and she refused. After that, there is only one action the cop can take. OP got arrested due to her poor behaviour and her refusal to leave. \n\nThe amount of paperwork that I suspect both the employee and the cop have to complete to record the situation make it very unlikely that this scenario occurred anywhere like OP describes. \n\nThere will be security tapes that show the truth. \n\nYTA. For lying about your role in the AITA post, and for thinking you have the right to delay the employee closing the store.

Your entitlement is disgusting.", "YTA. Closing time means they are closed, not a suggestion to slowly wrap things up.  You were instructed to leave. You refused, like you owned the store.  You were trespassing. Its the against the law to not leave when you were told to.  You broke the law.

I call shenanigans on this story.   Too many holes in the story.", "Just for fun I\u2019m going to fill in the blanks the OP left out.  I\u2019m betting she was slow to get to the registers, she was shopping for WAY more than bone broth, fruits and veggies.  Most people literally fast walk/run to grab what they need when it\u2019s close to closing time out of courtesy for the employees.\n\nOP was then told numerous times to leave after starting check out.  Check out was for a cart load of items and it was probably 10-15 minutes past closing when she started.\n\nOP obviously kept refusing.  Police show up.  Police witness OP being a jerk to the employee.  Police say they need to leave.  OP still acts like a jerk.  OP gets shiny bracelets.  \n\nI\u2019ve lived in Florida.  OP definitely gave the police a reason to arrest her and it was enough for a judge to slap her with a bail amount that required a $1000 bond.\n\nOh and OP YTA.  No way does a polite customer checking out past closing time end up getting arrested for just being there.", "YTA. How many times did they warn you that they were closing and that you wouldn't be able to check out?

He doesn't want to drive you to the station, fill out the paperwork, or deal with an issue that won't go anyway. And he definitely would have given you a warning first. \n\nWalmart workers are some of the least paid in the country, they don't want to deal with you.

Your story is preposterous.\n\nNo way that you didn't leave out some very important details of this story. \n\nI think 300 million people in America will attest how it's extremely hard to be surprised by a WalMart closing as it's not like they close silently. You just ignored a lot of warnings.", "YTA\nThe world doesn't revolve around you.\n\n>it was passed closing.\n\nNo, it was past closing. As in past tense, in the past. They were closed.

There is no way this story happened this way.  I am quite sure they saved all camera footage of you and what happened.    You were not respectful of the stores hours at all.  Once asked to leave and you stay it is trespassing and you can be arrested for it.   I saw your post where you want to sue them.  It doesn't matter your verdict here, the cameras will tell the tale.   So it doesn't matter how you spin it here.  Public opinion does not make the law more or less applicable.   Everything you do at a register- especially self check out is videoed with voice.  It is also date and time stamped.  So it will show when you were there and what time it was.", "There is no way we are getting the entire story here so YTA.", "YTA the store closes when the store closes.

Don't arrest me.\"", "Okay--- let's unpack here (with me a grocery store cashier / sometimes SCO manager)\n\nWe start closing down our checklanes because we are supposed to clock out at a certain time and if we don't we actually do get in trouble or written up for causing extra overtime hours to be used so ONE customer who can't / won't go through a normal register can check out.\n\nOur SCO closes at 11:00pm. We are also scheduled to leave at 11pm. This is where the disconnect lays. Our COPRORATION is telling you the customer that you can check out until x hour but the person minding SCO has X #of checkstands, that you must count the money, do paperwork, etc and turn in BEFORE we clock out at the time we are assigned to clock out. \n\nThis is part of our job.\n\n Having someone sneak up behind your head while you're trying to shut down machines and start checking out 500 dollars worth of groceries is a thing that the suits don't even imagine.\n\nThat SCO cashier could have already gotten in trouble for being too kind to people who want to buy a bazillion dollars in groceries 5 minutes before they close. You don't know until you work there.\n\nMy most recent example was I was working a regular checkstand and was called from upstairs and told to shut down and take my break. I turned my light off and was going to help the next two people in line who had products on the belt already. i went to put the sign up and a lady came crashing out of nowhere and told me she had been standing there for \"hours\" and how I \"had\" to take her.

Then I grab it and go. \n\nIf I needed multiple things, it waits for the next day. You can usually tell who has worked retail and who hasn't.", "Worked at a store that also told people this. They usually added that as long as you started the transaction before closing you were good. Other than the cashier manually closing the registers down they don't automatically. \n\nNever did that when I worked on the front end but I get it, sometimes it's hard to get people out when you just wanna go home and (around here anyways) as long as the person isn't causing trouble your last on the police priority list.", "It's in the passed! Get over it!", "That makes no sense. The hospital's responsibility is to the people that were admitted, not everybody in the ER and their family.", "yeah I used to cook professionally and one of those odd jobs was hospital catering. They requested us not to use spices, not to use salt, the food was very hard to manage to actually taste like something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand when I gave birth to my son in Spain the food in the hospital was amazing. I had a seafood rice I still remember fondly a very few years later.", "Arrested *and* $1k posted bail... for what... staying a minute past closing while checking out?", "Also lets say a cop was called in. Is he really going to arrest OP at the behest of a cashier and not the manager!?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she was ready to check out or in the middle of getting checked out....why would a cashier STOP ...get a cop and have OP arrested?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think OP is leaving out the part where they were being a total AH and causing a disturbance in the store.", "Absolutely. I work at a high end specialty market and we close at 9. We are not allowed to make announcements about heading up to the registers but at 8:55 we lock the exterior doors so no one else can enter and a mgr stands at the doors to let any remaining customers out. Sure its annoying when people come in at 8:50 and start filling an entire bascart but its retail and what you sign up for. Some people are just inconsiderate especially the wealthier clientele like ours but something more happened for them to trespass this person and they go to jail. You cant trespass someone when the doors are open for them to walk thu. We need the entire story not just part of it.", "One time working retail the lights went out while we were still trying to get customers to check out (they\u2019re on automatic timers set for 90 minutes after closing. OP is TA. There\u2019s more to this than she\u2019s telling.", "My husband worked in retail for over a decade and if someone was actually checking out at closing time (or had been waiting in line since before closing time), they would ring them out no question.   \n\nSomething is 100% being left out of the story here, because no retail manager is going to trespass a customer JUST for being in the process of checking out at closing.", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf and no store kicks out customers when they're at the register paying or in the line to pay, even after the store is already closed, especially in Florida. So OP is leaving something out or she's telling the truth and she has grounds to sue.", "The thing of it is especially since Covid all the hospitals are back up so some of the people in the ERs are admitted they are just down in the ER waiting on their bed to open. This is the situation in many hospitals. They can\u2019t keep up with the demand and staff can\u2019t deal with bullshit like not having food for their patients so staff is leaving causing more waits (sometimes days to weeks depending on the situation) so the food definitely should be for everyone. Hospitals need to do better. The company\u2019s are hoarding money and the staff and patients are suffering everyday. But this has nothing to do with this AITA it\u2019s just a rant.", "This was my initial thought ^", "If this happened the way she said it did then she would know she wasnt the AH but she conveniently adds all this extra shit, like she hadn\u2019t eaten all day and her mom was hungry and in the hospital. They have snack machines in the hospital. This whole story is suss.", "I\u2019ve also worked retail. At one store, the manager forgot to lock the door and a customer came in 15 after close & we still checked him out, all he had was a gallon of water. Another time we had a woman come in 1 minute before close, and the manager was trying to hurt her up, because the store was about to close, & she proceeded to duck from the manager and wandered around for almost 30 minutes until he caught her and told her she needed to leave or check out. Her response was \u201cI was just looking around until close\u201d & he responded by telling her she\u2019d overstayed her welcome since we were closed and told her to leave. Some people genuinely feel entitled and it\u2019s ridiculous.", "Back when I worked in retail, one lady wandered into the store five minutes before closing on the Saturday before Christmas, when we were open 6am to midnight. It was obvious she was just browsing and not a serious shopper, so I let her know we were closing in a few minutes. \"Oh really? I wanted to look around.\" I told her, \"Ma'am, you had eighteen hours to shop in our store today. I'm sorry that wasn't enough time for you.\" She left the store.", "I had amazing nurses who said \"order as much food as you can while you're in labor and we will put it in the fridge for you.  There isn't going to be anything good to eat and you're going to be hungry. \"  I think those were the best sandwiches I ever ate lol", "Agreed! Definitely not getting the entire story. I have seen some awful things happen at Walmart and no police involved. This seems tame on the surface for the police to be involved. Doesn't seem right....", "This kinda made me wonder if she just tried to take things when the employee told her she couldn't continue to check out..?", "Another oddity is that she was arrested and brought to jail rather than just escorted off the property. Typically in scenarios like this, unless you still refuse to leave after a cop asks you to, they will just escort you off the property and you won\u2019t be allowed back, and if you come back anyway *that\u2019s* when you get arrested and brought to jail. That makes me think either;\n\n1. She still refused to leave, even after the cop asked her to.\n\n2. This was not her first time causing problems at this Walmart.\n\n3. there was more than trespassing going on.", "I work in a grocery store and we leave one of the self checks on for night shift to buy stuff on their breaks.", "Like others have said, Don\u2019t wait til Mary\u2019s water breaks to start your shopping.", "Doesn't self check out close at a certain time, even before teller check out? They have to shut the machines off, count the money, etc.", "Lots of things are fishy in this one.\n\nDefinitely self checkout. OP said she told them she would leave when she finished, so that likely wasn't one more item to scan. But if she wasn't done by the time the store closed, with the amount of warning they give, she was getting a bunch more than something for her mom to eat. Most of the Walmarts here have police presence by the front door.", "I used to work retail in Australia and regularly had people run in 5 mins before close and just browse for 30mins saying they\u2019re almost done, give them a minute. Special place in hell for those people.", "Yep. Notice she didn\u2019t say how far past closing time she was there.", "That was my thought too. Cops don't even show up for serious crimes yet one was readily available all while op is scanning her items? Definitely not getting the whole story.", "They always leave an employee self checkout usually or they have a front end over night worker present to check them out when needed. I worked at bother Kroger and Walmart and both closed and this is how they did it. Not for customers. Plus, customers are given ample time to check out and are alerted multiple times when the store is closing. If you\u2019re actively in the check out line when it closing they will let you finish but her story is not adding up whatsoever.", "Tbf i see cops outside of walmart fairly regularly not even doing anything just sitting in their car.  And thats from when i get there to when i leave like 45-60 mins of them just sitting there.  But thats only been a few times ive seen that when i need to go outside for something i forgot in my car and still see them sitting there", "Food to have in a hospital +2hrs away from anywhere OP could cook anything.", "There is also the added fact that most places only allow management to call police if they call them at all. Pretty sure that unless there was an active crisis going on, they wouldn't call police.", "Yeah OP is clearly the subject of an r/talesfromretail post if one iota of this story is even true.", "The only reasons employees would go to the cops here is if \n\nA) OP was being aggressive or something \n\nOr B), OP was there long after close.\n\nLike, if the issue is that they're there after close, the employee wants to get home. So if OP was only a few minutes late and about to be done, it makes 0 sense to call the cops as that's just going to prolong the issue, potentially forcing the employees to stay MUCH later. So the story as is makes no sense.\n\nOf course, the only way OP would know how obvious of a lie this is is if they were able to put themselves in the employees shoes. Their inability to do so brings us right back around to the beginning of this story.", "Yeah I think it's kinda shitty that OP tried to use their sick, hospitalised mother to garner sympathy here and make themselves look less like the bad guy..", "Also *how* far past closing was it? Even if a cop was new/ inexperienced they usually don't arrest you for being in the store a minute or two after closing, especially if you're not belligerent. Now if they'd been warning you while you were shopping and you decided to ignore them and continue shopping and it was well after close when you stated trying to check out....", "Wish the employee would find this and tell us what happened lol", "My old job, We locked the doors and ignored the phones the MINUTE 5pm came. We were allowed to turn people away even if they just pulled up. \n\nOP, YTA.", "I work at a grocery store.  Cash office has until 1030 to count.  We close at 10.\nI've been a closing manager and def had people going through the till still at 10:20 and it makes me so mad.\n\nThiugh our self checkouts close right at 10, so you HAVE to go through a cashier.  But people just don't care, they think the world revolves around them.", "Fast food, 24 hour convenience stores, take out from Dennys, VENDING MACHINES. like seriously Walmart was not her ONLY option.", "I mean that\u2019s belligerent. Refusal to stop trespassing is actively wanting to fight. \u201cMake me\u201d is belligerent.", "Oh my god I have had a customer we had to call the cops on. She showed up half an hour before closing, loudly insisted she was just getting supplies for her daughter who was having a miscarriage, had a cart full of random bullshit, none of which would help a person in that situation, and a screaming child. We herd her to the check out five minutes after closing, we ring everything up, fight about coupons, and then it's time for her to pay: and it's a check. But it's not a regular check, because it's not HER check. It doesn't have her name on it, or the address on her license, or the address on some random mail she had with her. One of us managed to sneak back to the office and call the cops and by this time it's 45 after closing. The entire time her toddler child has been having a meltdown. I think it was an hour after closing before we finally got to leave, as the cops were talking to her outside, after she didn't get to get any of her items because she was pretty obviously trying to commit check fraud.", "You should look up the laws in the area you worked. There may be pay theft involved if you were still there with customers and forced off the clock. (At least I hope others see this and look into it as well). Depending on the statue of limitations you maybe able to go after them.", "I\u2019m a couponer, so I\u2019m that lady - I go late but not that close to closing, split up my transactions so they\u2019re not huge, let people cut in front of me between transactions, and use self checkouts whenever possible. I promise we aren\u2019t all jerks!", "That's terrible.  I wonder how long after closing that poor cashier had to work.", "And Walmart employees can get written up and/or fired for staying late", "Yes. You run and grab some bread, cheese, chips, an apple, and you leave. You can be in and out in 12 minutes or less.", "If Mom was so hungry there are a million other locations to purchase food past 11pm. If she arrived at 10:30 she had plenty of time to purchase food and leave. She\u2019s full of it.", "Unless violence was breaking out no Walmart cashier is calling the cops on anyone. They'd have to get the nod from either AP or the on duty member of management. Which means op was such a mess that the manager was willing to risk a corperate complaint to get op out the building. That is a lot of story left out here and this is the version of thinks paints them in the best light.", "Exactly. I garuntee alcohol was involved. Even if they arrested her, and took her to jail, she would have got a court summons and been out in 4 hours. They held her for 12. I'm guessing she was sloshed.", "My local WM actually started closing around midnight before covid, and I think it's 11pm now.  A guy that worked there told me they decided to close at night again, because pretty much the only \"customers\" they were getting overnight, were just people stealing........ Which makes me think that's what was really going on in OPs story.", "Not going to lie, it takes me at least 2 hours for my weekly shop, even in an familiar store but I also have ADHD and the struggle is real.\n\n\nThat being said, I never go into a store within an hour of closing unless i legitimately only need a very few amount of items. Like if I need a basket its too much, wait for tomorrow.", "So I guess now we know the other side of OP's story.", "I worked at Target and the people who think they\u2019re too good for Walmart are just the same type of assholes but with a little more money and entitlement. I once had an older man actually yell at me over fucking produce codes when I was like a week into working there. I barely lasted a month before quitting because it was absolutely miserable.", "If coupons were posted in a different manner people would say you\u2019re smart for saving your money and lowering your food bill, especially with inflation. Btw I\u2019m a couponer too. There\u2019s nothing wrong with people trying to make their life a little more affordable. Most of us are fine. But the small percent of shit heads ruin it for us, which sounds like is who these people experienced at some point", "I get the feeling that they filled a trolley full and then didn\u2019t start checking out till after close, then tried to use the fact they had started as justification to finish.", "Plus it's not like Walmart is the only place offering food. If you're in a town with a Walmart, they're bound to have at least one 24hr food option.\n\nWhose first choice is Walmart for ready made food anyway?", "This! The POS system is locked/shut down. And there's no way a cop would arrest someone over it given OP story. I'm wondering if OP went up and it was shut down and then tried to leave without finishing the transaction aka stealing. Which would make sense to be arrested for.", "Interesting.  Is it based off of like an actual name ID because you know... doppelgangers. Like do you get an alert if someone scans their card or enters their loyalty number and it's the banned person at the kiosk? I'm hoping the list isn't crazy long. I'm so curious now. Are people placed on it if they start fights or steal or what do they have to do to be on that list?", "Idk about other stores but the Walmart in my town starts announcing closing time an hour before closing", "Every time I've been in Walmart within an hour of closing they begin announcing \"the time is now x. The store closes in   45 minutes\" and then they give a 30 minute, 15 minute, 10 minute and 5 minute warning. They also tend to be pretty lenient, as long as you are in line or already scanning at the self checkout before they \"close\" they tend to bw fine.", "I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say I agree with this just due to the fact that it was closing time, but during the day absolutely", "I left it this year after 12. Gods bless everyone working retail who wants to get out  but can't.", "Alright I'm YouTube searching walmart flordia closing time customer arrested to find OP", "Yup. I briefly worked at Target as a cashier and it didn\u2019t matter if it was past close, we were there until the last customer checked out. We just locked the doors to the outside. They\u2019re not going to have you arrested for staying past close. They\u2019ll be fucking annoyed and tired, but just checking out past close doesn\u2019t get you arrested. Something stinks with this story.", "Because they\u2019ve been on their feet for 6 or so hours straight, usually being bitched at by a lot of people. They want to go home.", "Occasionally I'll have to pop in somewhere to buy one thing last minute, but even then if I hear the *thirty-minute* warning, I start panicking.", "Some stores have if automated, but yes we are supposed to announce 1 hour, 30, 15, 5 while closing.

Nothing overnight though.", "Pretty sure Walmarts stay open if you are inside if OP was arrested for nothing other than staying slightly over they will have a pretty good chance.", "I worked night shift at Walmart for a few years. We gave customers until 5 minutes after closing time to finish and leave. At five after, the registers were shut down no one could check out. Customers are reminded of when the store will close every five minutes starting half an hour before so everyone has more than enough time. If people wanted to make a fuss and not leave, we called the cops. Usually the police show up and they decide to listen.

Our security lead or an actual member of management has to.", "For twelve hours. I feel like people are missing that part, too. Normal procedure for low-level trespassing, as far as I know, is just for the police to escort you off the premises and instruct you not to return. I've never seen it go further than that. \n\nOP was in a jail cell for twelve hours, until she paid a thousand dollar bond. That wasn't a minor trespass. She did something that made the state itself have an issue with her behaviour. She did something that caused her to be actively detained.", "You guys, stop!! I'm getting hives just reading all this! \ud83e\udd23", "She said an employee came to her and said they were closed and could not check out.  Then she said she was in the middle of checking out.

No, idiot, paying by credit/debit card would make it easy. Paying with cash means the till has to be counted against.", "I work in retail. when I was in a TJMaxx store once at closing, I paid and headed to the door. Curious if it would be as bad as my store getting people to leave, I counted about 20 people still shopping. Not a single one appeared to be hurrying or moving toward the registers. They all acted stone deaf. I went to my car and watched from the parking lot and still no one moved. Seriously I thought we had problems with certain customers but that place catered to a whole new level of asshole.", "I had my daughter right before 9, since the cafe closed at 7 they had me pick out what I wanted to eat right before the closed. I can tell you that mid pushing absolutely nothing sounded good and I really didn\u2019t want to deal with that. I got a bowl of soup and some fruit. They set it aside until she was born. After I was done I ate that so quick and I didn\u2019t care that it was ice cold. Then my in laws got us some fast food because I was still starving and I couldn\u2019t get anything else from the hospital. The one I was in wasn\u2019t underfunded or anything just not in a heavily populated area and fairly small.", "I read that, OP's story doesn't add up.

Ffs, we had been open 6 AM to 12AM for two weeks straight, you couldn\u2019t get what you needed then? Working retail made me hate Christmas.", "Same and in the US.

There is no way in hell the punishment that OP and family suffered was warranted.", "Definitely doesn't seem like the whole story is being told. Every store I've ever been to at the end of the night no matter if it was a tiny local market or a giant conglomerate like walmart closes the doors around 15 min before their posted closing time and they start announcing over the speakers that customers should start to bring their items to the registers.

At 5 to see 10 minutes before closing, they tell everyone to come to the front of the store to get checked out.  As long as you are in line, you get checked out.  I believe she was still in the store area heading for the  check out after the register closed down when the employee told her the store was closed.   She said she was in the middle of checking out, but imo she was in the middle of going to the check outs.   She could not get checked out if there was no one there to check her out."]}
