They assumed you weren\u2019t serious, and if he really wants to go to college he can take out loans or get scholarships.", "NTA.  That was very kind of you to pay for Amy and Maria which you had no obligation to do.  No one has any right to expect this.  How someone could steal from you etc and still expect you to pay for college is crazy.  He can go home, grow up, and learn to be a decent human being.", "NTA at all. He treated you badly and stole that\u2019s ridiculous. Stick to your Guns", "I'm so confused.  Why are you fostering all of these kids that aren't yours?  Why the hell is wrong with Dave's parents?", "NTA\n\nwhat a surprise to teens that continued displays of non-prosocial behavior actually negatively impacts them...you taught him a bigger life lesson than college ever would", "NTA although I can see where they are coming from but I would remind them about the theft as I feel that action is alone enough to justify not paying out", "NTA. Dave has already shown that he is not appreciative of your generosity.", "NTA \n\nNobody gets to decide how you spend your money or who you send to college. These people seem to expect you to finance their futures. You aren't a free family college fund.", ">he picked out an expensive college,\n\nDid he get accepted at the expensive school?  Just because he wants to go there doesn't mean they want him.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t live up to his end of the bargain and you told him you weren\u2019t paying. Done deal. Now if you pay for every other child in each extended family except him that would be a bad move.", "Dave fucked around and found out. Neither him nor his parents should be surprised that that your generosity does not extend to him NTA", "After biting the hand that feeds him, he has no right to assume you will pay for college. You already to him so. Actions have consequences. He made his choice and has to live with it\n\nNTA", "NTA. He chose to act that way he did, which was his parent\u2019s responsibility to get to the bottom of and manage but that\u2019s another story, but you were very clear and upfront that you would not pay for his college after the way he treated you.", "NTA.\n\nOP, you basically fostered 3 kids of extended family. Plus you have 3 kids of your own. That\u2019s impressive that you took on such a huge responsibility for your family. \n\nDon\u2019t stress about not paying for your nephew\u2019s college. You have no obligation or responsibility as you are not his parent. You didn\u2019t even have to take him in for the time you did to help your brother. That investment into your nephew was more than enough. Find peace in that and let it go. Keep your nephew accountable for his own future. There are plenty of opportunities for grants, scholarships and loans out there for school - or he can postpone college and work to save up money and attend at a later date - or his father and mother can front the bill.", "NTA, I agree with everyone else. But I do wonder why you haven't kicked him out, definitely for the stealing but also the way he ist behaving in general. The kid sounds hard to live with and your husband and daughters have to deal with him, too.", "NTA at all, you\u2019re not an ATM.", "NTA, perhaps give him a chance to spend a yr at a community college taking basics to prove himself if you choose to do so. I was a wreck in HS but took a few yrs off after HS then started community and changed my life around. Got scholarships transferring to university and maintained a 3.7gpa after having a 1.6 in HS. Btw huge huge props for supporting them all, obviously don't know the details but those two ladies you made a huge impact on their life.", "I trained my nephew...\n\nEsh", "NTA, it's your money, he didn't make life easy. But. He was a child. Some kids go through stuff. Some of it is coping with the whole school thing, especially if they weren't popular. My youngest was hell during the school years. I chose not to do the tough love thing and it saved his life. Found out he had some learning disabilities which caused frustration and he went sideways in life for a bit. Now, he's the better child. Personally, I'd sit down with him and have a conversation about his behaviour. I know him expecting the same as the others sticks in your craw but I absolutely guarantee that you would have gotten the same from the others if you'd said no to them. I would pay for him. It may be that he needs this more than the others ever did and not doing so is straining the entire family dynamic, brewing all kinds of resentment. If it doesn't cause you financial stress at all, I hope you give him this opportunity.", "NTA. I was a little on the fence until I read the bit about your nephew being difficult and more importantly stealing from you.  That sort of bad behavior does not get rewarded. You did your part in trying to give him a leg up in the world and now your done.  That's okay.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It seems failed to teach his Dave that realmlife comes with consequences. You ended up handing him the consequences, he decided to pretend they weren't there and when you followed through he went crying with mom and dad. The latter than once again failed to teach his son that life comes with consequences.\n\nYou follow through. Dave got his chances and didn't take them.", "NTA.  You made yourself clear.  It\u2019s not your fault that Dave didn\u2019t believe you meant what you said.\n\nWith that out of the way, if you may want some further advice, I have some.  (If not, please skip reading the rest of this post.)  \n\nYou don\u2019t say so, but it sounds like family is important to you and despite the fact you\u2019re not the asshole, this sounds like it may cause a rift.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to prevent that, there may be a potential compromise: you can give some conditions under which you could see paying for Dave\u2019s college. Those conditions would be things that would prove to you that Dave has grown up, gained responsibility, is sorry for his former actions, and is now a good, hardworking person. \n\nThen step back and see if Dave meets those conditions or not.  If he doesn\u2019t, then you have something you can point to.  It\u2019s not you making the decision to deny Dave his college money.  It is Dave\u2019s ongoing choices.  And if Dave does meet the conditions, perhaps you could see your way to forgiving him and providing him a better opportunity to moving forward.  After all, there\u2019s plenty of people who have turned their lives around after doing dumb/bad things as kids.  \n\nThat\u2019s only if you want to, of course.  As it stands, you\u2019re not the asshole and will never be the asshole. Dave burned his own bridges.  But family can be a bit more complicated than that, as I\u2019m sure we all know.\n\nUnder this proposal, you won\u2019t have to spend money on an ungrateful, lazy, turd, but the family will be mollified because the opportunity for Dave is there if he straightens up and flies right.  \n\nNot something you have to do, or even should do, but if you\u2019re feeling generous and interested in maintaining these family relationships, it may be a workable compromise.", "nta", "Nta", "NTA. You sound like an amazing aunt. It\u2019s not your fault or problem that Dave didn\u2019t appreciate the valuable life lessons you were willingly to provide. As the kids say, fuck around and find out. You helped all of them (parents included!) out of the goodness of your heart and they should be **thankful** instead of money grabbing. (Not to mention the audacity of selecting an expensive college because he thought you were paying).", "NTA. You gave him opportunities he squandered, and you made it clear you would not be offering additional financial assistance. I\u2019m not sure why he or his parents are shocked.", "NTA and what an entitled AH. You paid for school out of the kindness of your heart not because it was your duty.
