Personally, I'd sit down with him and have a conversation about his behaviour. I know him expecting the same as the others sticks in your craw but I absolutely guarantee that you would have gotten the same from the others if you'd said no to them. I would pay for him. It may be that he needs this more than the others ever did and not doing so is straining the entire family dynamic, brewing all kinds of resentment.

You don't owe him to pay for it just because you paid for other nibbling that had a good relationship with you... let him learn the lesson \"you reap what you sow\".", "Nta, you warned him ahead of time that you would not be paying. He took advantage of your generosity and caused trouble after you took him in. He doesn't deserve to have his college paid for, he should be sent back home.", "NTA they can pay for his college. Actually do something for once", "NTA you reap what you sow", "NTA\n\nThere's no fair when it's your own damn money and others think they are entitled to ANY of it.\n\nYou are a non-benevolent dictator of your own fortune and no one has any rights or say in how you spend it.", "Why are you supposed to reward someone who stole from you? He had a chance for free college and he blew it. NTA", "NTA.  You gave plenty of warning to both Sam and Dave that you wouldn\u2019t be paying because of Dave\u2019s criminal actions.  You don\u2019t reward bad behaviour.  Dave had plenty of time to work on himself and apologize.  Not getting any money is a consequence of his actions.", "In the US there\u2019s a saying called \u201cdon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you.\u201d I imagine there\u2019s a similar one in your culture as well. I Dave abused your generosity and doesn\u2019t deserve the opportunity.", "NTA, it's a good time that your nephew learned that actions have consequences and you don't owe him sh\\*t.", "NTA", "NTA. As soon as he stole from you, he lost all standing. Guessing none of the other kids did that. Not paying is also the best decision financially because he sounds like kind of guy that would drop out of school when things get hard and then all that money spent would have been for nothing. Tell Sam you don't pay for the schooling of people who steal from you.", "You are the hero we don't deserve."]}
