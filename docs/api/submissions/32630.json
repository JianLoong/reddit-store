I mean in a sense it is a thing, but that thing is called stealing. Planning is something different. Poor OP and stepdaughter.", "Exactly! I don't understand how a real string of pearls could get \"destroyed\" in a car accident in which the worst injury was a broken arm. Good pearls are individually knotted, not strung like beads.", "That's what I was thinking too. That would have made more sense to begin with rather than sharing a piece of jewelry. That sounds like an argument waiting to happen.", "I was thinking have a couple (or just one each) remaining pearls strung on necklaces for each female. So five necklaces total. No sharing.", "Doesn\u2019t take much force to break the strand. Could have snagged on something pretty easily and snapped off. Plus in an accident, it could be hard to find the beads once scattered. Or it could be once the necklace snapped it flew and got crushed. Pearls are soft so it doesn\u2019t take much, a car running over it or striking a hard surface, to mess them up.", "Broken glass probably caused an issue or blood.", "My wife's sister's husband and Elsa and Anna's father.", "Let me guess\u2026 you\u2019re the greedy Aunt?", "Just for it to get destroyed?

The original one was destroyed in a car accident. That's not anyone's fault.\n\nIt would be nice if she could part with one of her pieces, but it's also fine if she doesn't want to. But her family isn't evil for wanting a piece from their grandma's collection after losing one in such a tragic way.", "It wasn't just Gigi's \"wish\" to give it to May.

So it is now May's property and NO ONE else has a right to it.", "OP said the family's religion doesn't allow the jewelry and someone in the family said he would be happy to destroy it if they got it. So apparently they don't really want anything else as a family piece.", "NTA\n\nIt's May's jewelry now, not the family's.\n\nIf you want to help, get May a safe or a deposit box to safely store the jewelry. I've seen too many case of heirloom stolen by close family members.", "Since the jewelry was given as a gift to May during great-grandmother's lifetime, it was not a part of g-gma's estate upon passing.\n\nOnly May can decide on changing status of her jewelry.\n\nIf I were you I'd have s private discussion with May and offer her a Bank box to keep jewelry in until age 18(or 21).\n\nThis may piss off your wife, but she's not shutting down this proposed theft of her daughter's belongings, so I'd let her be pissed off at me rather than May.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  May was given the jewelry before Grandma died. It isn\u2019t family jewelry.", "NTA.  \"before she died, Gigi gave it all to May because the rest of it was all religious/cultural \". This was given by Gigi before she died.  Therefore it never was part of her estate.  Taking it from May is theft pure and simple.  If you can't trust the other adults keep it in a safety deposit box at the bank until she's 18.  Make sure only you, not even her mother, has access to the box.  Your SIL sounds greedy as hell.  What does your wife think?", "They couldn\u2019t grab a few loose pearls? Go back to the crash site. There\u2019s some around. Make a new contemporary necklace", "Nta. Your sil has no business laying claim to jewellery already been given to May.  It now already belongs to her solely.  What a terrible incident to happen on such an event, glad to hear May came out of unhurt.  The necklace is gone through no fault of May.  Who ever is making a big deal out this over May well being is the ah", "My mother gave me pearls (probably not real) and I wore them for graduation pictures and that\u2019s when my daughter wore them as well. They\u2019ll be passed on down until there is no one to give them to", "You inserted yourself into family drama between females over jewelry and go all pikachu face when when it backfires. Here's some life advice: women sometimes just want to bounce things off of you, perhaps have you just listen, or give comfort. They do want you to solve the problem for them unless they explicitly ask for that.", "NTA. It sounds like there are people in the \"family\" who have no issues about going against Gigi's wishes while claiming to be honoring Gigi's wishes.\n\nBTW, how was the necklace destroyed? Did you actually see the remaining parts of it, or is this what was told to you?", "NTA\n\nGrandma gave it to May. It's hers. It's not her fault that the family piece was destroyed.

Everything else you said in your post is irrelevant.", "NTA. It was given to her it's hers by all rights. I suggest you set up a safety deposit box for it and a different bank then you normally use for it and lock it away till she is an adult. Because I guarantee you one of them is going to take it and shoot like they want to.", "My best friend growing up had a grandmother flee... can't remember country... from the nazi's. It was in a way that they (the family) literally only had what they were wearing. My friend's grandma was wearing a pearl necklace. When any of the girls in the family turned 16, she would take a single pearl and have it made into a beautiful delicate necklace. Some a little different from others. \n\nJust an idea if at least 5 got recovered (and if not necklaces, earrings or rings too). \n\nAlso, NTA. Gigi gave the other stuff to May. It's hers. The others need to back off and check their greed.", "May needs a safety deposit box if she still lives in the house. Maybe you could facilitate that for her. If anyone ask where the jewelry is she can tell them it is safe. NTA", "Nta at all. It's May's, thank you for sticking up for her. Are there still some pearls off the necklace saved? Isn't it possible to make enough necklaces/earrings something like that from the remaining pearls, so all off the women can have one?", "NTA. That jewellery stopped being the property of Gigi before she died, and became the property of May. This isn't about sharing a family heirloom, this is about stealing May's possessions, that she wears all the time, to give to people who don't even want any of it, and some of whom will likely destroy anything they get. This is clearly about punishing May for the loss of the necklace even though it wasn't her fault. If anyone's being discriminated against here, it's May. Keep standing up for her right to keep her own possessions, you're being a great step-dad. Make sure they don't try to guilt May into giving it up, as well. Make sure May is well aware that this is *her* jewellery, and no one else has any right to it, and that no is a complete sentence. She doesn't have to explain why she's refusing to give up her jewellery, she just has to keep saying no, as do you. Get your wife on side, as well, she needs to be standing up for her daughter's right to keep her possessions alongside you.", "This! They have no right to it. I would go so far as to hide it from the family. Poor May. NTA", "This! There are very many crafty people in this world. Pearls can be made/added into rings, earrings, pendants, bracelets.

If it's in the way its getting cut off.", "THIS, until she moves out.", "Someone meaning mom.", "And women sometimes just want to steal.", "perhaps there was a fire or they were driven over or smashed, or lost in a river or mud or even dissolved in some fluid. Pearls are not robust.", "I have a beautiful necklace pendant that is silver with single pearl and matching earrings (gift for my sweet 16). They could divide the remaining pearls up and design their own settings for them. Not only would they each get grandmas pearls, but they could design the settings to something that they would wear every day.", "Real pearl necklaces have knots between the pearls to keep them from scattering. If they scattered then they were fake.", "And also, they may have just gotten lost in the wreckage", "My mom was a jeweler for most of my childhood. If she had to work on a Saturday, I would usually go with her. It was a small business so it was pretty cool. I remember watching my mom knot the pearls using a special tool. She said it takes forever but that\u2019s how real pearls are strung, so they don\u2019t get lost if the strand breaks. I remember watching her so delicately string/knot them, clean them, rub oil to condition them and put them in a box.", "I had a knotted pearl necklace that broke but the knots got pulled so tight that the pearls just slid over them and scattered.  Luckily it was inside and I recovered all of them.", "Yep. It sounds like it wasn\u2019t actually valuable (monetarily). Buy a replacement necklace they can share."]}
