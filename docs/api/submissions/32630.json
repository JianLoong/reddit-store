It would have happened to anyone, and I don't think she should get punished for it by losing jewelry she wears every day forever, which is what would happen.

I don't understand how a real string of pearls could get \"destroyed\" in a car accident in which the worst injury was a broken arm. Good pearls are individually knotted, not strung like beads.", "That's what I was thinking too. That would have made more sense to begin with rather than sharing a piece of jewelry. That sounds like an argument waiting to happen.", "I was thinking have a couple (or just one each) remaining pearls strung on necklaces for each female. So five necklaces total. No sharing.", "Doesn\u2019t take much force to break the strand. Could have snagged on something pretty easily and snapped off. Plus in an accident, it could be hard to find the beads once scattered. Or it could be once the necklace snapped it flew and got crushed.

The original one was destroyed in a car accident. That's not anyone's fault.\n\nIt would be nice if she could part with one of her pieces, but it's also fine if she doesn't want to. But her family isn't evil for wanting a piece from their grandma's collection after losing one in such a tragic way.", "It wasn't just Gigi's \"wish\" to give it to May. She physically gave the jewelry to May before she passed. So it is now May's property and NO ONE else has a right to it.", "OP said the family's religion doesn't allow the jewelry and someone in the family said he would be happy to destroy it if they got it. So apparently they don't really want anything else as a family piece."]}
