{"id": 31328, "submission_id": "17zcyox", "title": "AITA for having my own thanksgiving instead of going to my mother\u2019s?", "selftext": "Hi, first time posing here! \nThis year I (27F) will be having my first Thanksgiving with my boyfriend (39M). He\u2019s an excellent cook, and loves to cook for thanksgiving. He gives himself rave reviews on his homemade gravy. In September, I asked my mom about thanksgiving plans. In the past, my mom cooked and hosted thanksgiving at her house. It was always a small group of us: my mom, her husband, me, my sister, my aunt, and my uncle. Small, cozy, comfortable. But she said she wasn\u2019t sure if she was even cooking this year because my aunt had other plans at that time. So, I informed my mom that my BF and I were going to host our own Thanksgiving dinner, and that she, her husband, and my sister were all welcome to join us. She said she would think about it and run it by my sister.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, and plans changed. My aunt, uncle, and sister are going to my mom\u2019s house for thanksgiving, and my mom is suddenly pulling out all the stops for her traditional thanksgiving dinner. Clearly, they never even humored the thought of joining my BF and I at our house. Which is fine, I can understand how that might be uncomfortable given that my relationship is fairly new (9 months). But, my mother made it abundantly clear that I am expected to at least make an appearance at her house on thanksgiving with my 2 year old son (BF is not the father), and she didn\u2019t extend an invitation to my BF, who will be left alone at the house while I\u2019d be gone. \n\nWhile I\u2019m still unsure as to whether or not I\u2019ll stop by her house to visit that day, I want to know if anyone thinks I\u2019m the asshole for having my own thanksgiving instead of joining my family, as has been the tradition over the years. I\u2019d like to think that holiday traditions should be fluid, and allow space for families to grow and change. My mother has made me feel extremely guilty for choosing not to join them which makes me wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong here. I just can\u2019t bear the thought of leaving my BF alone at home on a holiday like this. He doesn\u2019t have any family up where we live. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1700444139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zcyox/aita_for_having_my_own_thanksgiving_instead_of/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
