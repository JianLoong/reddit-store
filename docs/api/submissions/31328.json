He\u2019s an excellent cook, and loves to cook for thanksgiving. He gives himself rave reviews on his homemade gravy. In September, I asked my mom about thanksgiving plans. In the past, my mom cooked and hosted thanksgiving at her house. It was always a small group of us: my mom, her husband, me, my sister, my aunt, and my uncle. Small, cozy, comfortable. But she said she wasn\u2019t sure if she was even cooking this year because my aunt had other plans at that time. So, I informed my mom that my BF and I were going to host our own Thanksgiving dinner, and that she, her husband, and my sister were all welcome to join us. She said she would think about it and run it by my sister.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, and plans changed. My aunt, uncle, and sister are going to my mom\u2019s house for thanksgiving, and my mom is suddenly pulling out all the stops for her traditional thanksgiving dinner. Clearly, they never even humored the thought of joining my BF and I at our house. Which is fine, I can understand how that might be uncomfortable given that my relationship is fairly new (9 months). But, my mother made it abundantly clear that I am expected to at least make an appearance at her house on thanksgiving with my 2 year old son (BF is not the father), and she didn\u2019t extend an invitation to my BF, who will be left alone at the house while I\u2019d be gone. \n\nWhile I\u2019m still unsure as to whether or not I\u2019ll stop by her house to visit that day, I want to know if anyone thinks I\u2019m the asshole for having my own thanksgiving instead of joining my family, as has been the tradition over the years. I\u2019d like to think that holiday traditions should be fluid, and allow space for families to grow and change. My mother has made me feel extremely guilty for choosing not to join them which makes me wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong here. I just can\u2019t bear the thought of leaving my BF alone at home on a holiday like this. He doesn\u2019t have any family up where we live. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1700444139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zcyox/aita_for_having_my_own_thanksgiving_instead_of/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You guys started dating after last Christmas, so you haven't even been through a holiday season together. \n\nIt seems like they don't feel like they can be honest with you about not wanting him around. You describe your mothers holidays as small, cozy, and comfortable. There are a maximum of 6 adult attendees. This isn't some big family event with an open door policy where anyone can bring as many guests as they like and there's more than enough food to go around. This is a small, intimate, private family dinner. They haven't gotten a chance to get to know him yet (because you barely have!!) They likely don't want a total stranger sitting at the dinner making things awkward for them. They love you and they want you to be present, but they do not want to deal with the discomfort of being around your partner. They are actually trying to maintain their relationship with you while also maintaining their boundaries and that's totally okay and normal. \n\nAlso, can you please explain how your bf would be alone on thanksgiving if you go to your mother's? I thought you were going to host, so wouldn't he have guests of his own to entertain him after you leave? Or was he not planning on inviting any guests and it was just going to be your family...?", "NTA mom doesn\u2019t like your bf", "NTA.\n\nYou do not owe your mother a Thanksgiving visit.

Just be very distant with them, see if they apologise (although I doubt it). Do not make plans with them for Christmas/New Year either. Distance yourself, get them no or crappy Christmas gifts. I would be going low contact after this. They've shown you how little they value you, return the sentiment!", "This ^ OP says it all in a nutshell.", "It kinda seems like \"having her own thanksgiving\" actually meant inviting the people from her mom's thanksgiving to her place instead. If they are going to mom's as usual, OP now has no guests. She also mentioned that if she went to her mom's house, he boyfriend would be left alone, so it seems like he doesn't have any guests either. \n\n\nIt kind of seems like the real issue is that this 39 year old man doesn't have anywhere else to go for thanksgiving, for whatever reason, and OP's family doesn't want to spend their thanksgiving with him. Now OP feels caught between a rock and a hard place because she feels her issue would be solved if they simply let him come. But the issue would also be solved if he had anywhere else to go. So the question is, why doesn't he have anywhere else to go? Is it because he was disowned over something like being queer, or is he just a jackass/abuser/criminal that no one wants to be around for good reason?", "Yep.  Do a little visit with kiddo and BF, say hi, be gone in a half hour.", "Not to mention that 12 year age gap \ud83d\udc40"]}
