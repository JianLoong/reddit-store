Any bonus he makes or money back from taxes goes immediately into retirement.  Doing it this way leaves us no money for vacations or big trips.  \n\n\nSince we got married and moved in with each other, I have been completely responsible for all the shopping, whether it is clothes, groceries, furniture or whatever else.  I learned very early on with the help of my mom how to coupon clip and how to use points cards to their maximum potential.

She says you pay for her to go\".     \n\n\nMy husband confronted me about the situation and I confessed to him what I have been doing.  He was extremely hurt saying that with all these points, we could have done a lot more as a family, rather than just one person hoarding them all to themselves. And if I set him up with his own credit cards to get even more points, it would have been a lot easier for us to do big family vacations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy entire family has been calling me selfish and a jerk for not being more open about the points but I feel that work very hard to get to the point levels I have gotten to and that making them more open for use would burn through them quickly and not allow them to be used for bigger things.  \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676587960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1143nkj/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_about_all_my/", "score": 2760, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's using CC's to pay for said expense and getting CC rewards.  It isn't like she's spending hours to get them, it's a literal swipe.  It's a percentage back on their household expenses.  Plus the rewards she gets back for CC purchases for her own \"fun\" budget.\n\nHer comment about him asking why she didn't tell him so he could do the same, makes me believe he grew not using CC and didn't know about the rewards benefits.  So she must have access to the accounts to pay for the CC's balance each month.  So he doesn't have a \"chokehold\" on the checkbook.  She's has access and that's why he's never seen the pts.\n\nSo conservative 50k a year on crappy pts gets her 1k in rewards if not more.  Plus her personal fun money rewards say another 100 dollars.  It isn't a ton, but if her husband had any expense accounts for his business they could've been earning so much more... and her post says, he would've used this for \"bigger\" vacations (since they do go on day/weekend trips), where the \"whole\" family could've gone.\n\nThe concept that she \"earned\" these is BS.  Also everyone shouting that she's being financially abused, isn't actually reading her post.  She has access to the funds since she's paying off her CC's.

Where is the family fun money?", "7.5% of 150k+ is $11,250+ a year for your personal money right? That's your personal funds things like the girls trip would come out of. And is far more personal fun money than most people get. Most people don't get $900 a month of discretionary spending. Assuming kids' expenses are part of the household budget or otherwise fairly split, nothing about the %s strike me as unfair. Where it starts to become unfair is when you make $500 off reward points from the grocery category and put all the rewards solely in your personal funds category instead of the rewards staying in their category or being redistributed into all the categories by the %s agreed on by the budget  I can understand a little, you worked to make those savings, but he worked to make the paycheck that funds everything. That's why you guys are both supposed to have an equal 7.5% personal spending budget. What you're doing skews it from an equal partnership with equal rewards into you sort of embezzling from your household budget for selfish reasons. In my opinion, in a household with shared funding you should both agree on budgets, and should stick with them. If he is dictating a budget and not allowing you input that can cross into financially abusive, but isn't necessarily the case here without more info. If you are hiding funds and spending them for just you- that is wrong. Hiding enough to take multiple vacations and lieing about it is wrong both in spending joint money but is also a huge lie effecting your marriage and both your relationships with your family. For five years you have been going on vacations and lieing to *everyone* where the funds came from. It seems like the points may also have been a secret addiction- a way to have control and pull one over on your husband- but I may be reading a bit too much into that here. You've also been caught lieing to everyone close to you which is going to effect credibility moving forward- it's a little \"the boy who called wolf\", where your family will wonder if your husband really paid for X and your husband will wonder if your family really paid for Y or not trust that you dont have other secret funds. I would expect this will have repercussions both with your husband and extended family.\n\nIt sounds like a good time to apologize for this type of stuff and start working together to reevaluate the budget and how to incorporate any reward points (agreeing on what to redeem them on together). Perhaps planning out a new category for family trips- both girls trips, boys trips, and with your husband and kids. Your husband shouldn't unilaterally choose this stuff, but he also seems to have some sound financial choices in the %s you laid out (what a nice savings for your kids educations!), so maybe see if you can add a little wiggle room in for breaks. Looking at the numbers, there's plenty of money for reasonable vacations if you decide that's a priority. Even if you and your husband give up half a % from each of your personal budgets, that's 1% of 150k+, or $15,000+ for a yearly vacation budget. If your husband doesn't share vacations as a priority, you could save a larger portion of your own personal budget for the girls trips or to take your kids on vacation. It's not like there's no money here, which confuses me why you have to clip coupons and use reward points. It kinda seems like either he's over the top financially abusive or you have bad spending habits and found a secretive way to get funds behind his back. If neither of those seem right, maybe you're just bad communicators.\n\nIt's also really unfair of your husband to have made other people pay for your portion of a trip for years without any reciprocity, and demand they pay his share. That and the financial control are things to be wary of. I would also try to self reflect on why you wanted your family to believe your husband paid and why you wanted your husband to think your family paid and why you hid that you came up with a way of saving for the trip.", "ESH.
