I am a stay-at-home mom with 4 beautiful children ( 8,6,4,2). My husband makes 150k+ a year but decides where every dollar and cent goes.  50% to day-to-day expenses, 25% to the children's education savings, 10% to family savings, 7.5% to his personal spending and 7.5% to my personal spending.  Any bonus he makes or money back from taxes goes immediately into retirement.  Doing it this way leaves us no money for vacations or big trips.  \n\n\nSince we got married and moved in with each other, I have been completely responsible for all the shopping, whether it is clothes, groceries, furniture or whatever else.  I learned very early on with the help of my mom how to coupon clip and how to use points cards to their maximum potential.

My husband only knew about the coupon clipping, not the rewards points. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the past 5 years, I have been going on a \"Girl's trip\" with my family, every year. I have been telling my husband that my sisters, sister-in-laws, mom and grandma have been paying for me to go since I can't afford it, but in reality, I have been using the rewards points to pay for the ticket, using rewards to pay for our groceries and using my difference to pay off my credit cards so that I am able to go on the trip. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year, my brothers, brother-in-laws, father and grandfather decided to do their own \"Boys trip\" and invited my husband.  My husband told them that unless they can help him as the girls help me, he would have to decline the invite. My brother responded to him with \"What do you mean? She says you pay for her to go\".     \n\n\nMy husband confronted me about the situation and I confessed to him what I have been doing.  He was extremely hurt saying that with all these points, we could have done a lot more as a family, rather than just one person hoarding them all to themselves. And if I set him up with his own credit cards to get even more points, it would have been a lot easier for us to do big family vacations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy entire family has been calling me selfish and a jerk for not being more open about the points but I feel that work very hard to get to the point levels I have gotten to and that making them more open for use would burn through them quickly and not allow them to be used for bigger things.  \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676587960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1143nkj/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_about_all_my/", "score": 685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here\u2019s an idea, why don\u2019t you get a job?  Yes, your husband is way too rigid with controlling the spending. But rather than hoarding some pathetic rewards points for yourself, get a job and actually make some money to contribute. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like the way you are handling the money, discuss it.

It is kinda selfish to hoard points to take yourself on a trip and it's also crappy to lie about it, although I admit neither of those things would be necessary if your husband was a budget team member instead of a budget dictator. Also, yes, you worked hard for those points, and that's real work and a real skill, effectively a part time job on top of the full-time job of taking care of your kids. But your husband works hard at work for cold hard cash, which is also real work and a real skill, but he's not padding his own allowance with that money. If you think it would be unfair for him to pay himself a 10% allowance and you 5% instead of 7.5% each, I think it's equally unfair that you alone reap the \"proceeds\" of your part-time job.\n\nI don't know what kind of spending your husband does on his own/for work, but I think he makes a valid point that your expertise + whatever spending he's doing could likely yield more savings and more points, either giving him his own points balance to play with, or combining with yours and making the whole system that much more powerful.", "ESH You both need to sit down and have some conversations about money priorities.

Yes she's coupon clipping and reducing house hold expense from the budget by finding the best deals.  My partner and I do this together... but she isn't \"EARNING\" anything.  She's using CC's to pay for said expense and getting CC rewards.  It isn't like she's spending hours to get them, it's a literal swipe.  It's a percentage back on their household expenses.  Plus the rewards she gets back for CC purchases for her own \"fun\" budget.\n\nHer comment about him asking why she didn't tell him so he could do the same, makes me believe he grew not using CC and didn't know about the rewards benefits.  So she must have access to the accounts to pay for the CC's balance each month.  So he doesn't have a \"chokehold\" on the checkbook.  She's has access and that's why he's never seen the pts.\n\nSo conservative 50k a year on crappy pts gets her 1k in rewards if not more.  Plus her personal fun money rewards say another 100 dollars.  It isn't a ton, but if her husband had any expense accounts for his business they could've been earning so much more... and her post says, he would've used this for \"bigger\" vacations (since they do go on day/weekend trips), where the \"whole\" family could've gone.\n\nThe concept that she \"earned\" these is BS.  Also everyone shouting that she's being financially abused, isn't actually reading her post.  She has access to the funds since she's paying off her CC's.  The reason why she hasn't left him, is he's taking care of her and the kids and has a plan to make it so THEY can enjoy retirement at 50.  She get's the same amount as he does, she makes all the decision on where that 50% goes since she's paying for it with CC's.\n\nEARNED... come on people, she's just swiping the card and getting the points.
