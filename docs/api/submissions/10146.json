I am a stay-at-home mom with 4 beautiful children ( 8,6,4,2). My husband makes 150k+ a year but decides where every dollar and cent goes.  50% to day-to-day expenses, 25% to the children's education savings, 10% to family savings, 7.5% to his personal spending and 7.5% to my personal spending.  Any bonus he makes or money back from taxes goes immediately into retirement.  Doing it this way leaves us no money for vacations or big trips.  \n\n\nSince we got married and moved in with each other, I have been completely responsible for all the shopping, whether it is clothes, groceries, furniture or whatever else.  I learned very early on with the help of my mom how to coupon clip and how to use points cards to their maximum potential.

My husband only knew about the coupon clipping, not the rewards points. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the past 5 years, I have been going on a \"Girl's trip\" with my family, every year. I have been telling my husband that my sisters, sister-in-laws, mom and grandma have been paying for me to go since I can't afford it, but in reality, I have been using the rewards points to pay for the ticket, using rewards to pay for our groceries and using my difference to pay off my credit cards so that I am able to go on the trip. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year, my brothers, brother-in-laws, father and grandfather decided to do their own \"Boys trip\" and invited my husband.  My husband told them that unless they can help him as the girls help me, he would have to decline the invite. My brother responded to him with \"What do you mean? She says you pay for her to go\".     \n\n\nMy husband confronted me about the situation and I confessed to him what I have been doing.  He was extremely hurt saying that with all these points, we could have done a lot more as a family, rather than just one person hoarding them all to themselves. And if I set him up with his own credit cards to get even more points, it would have been a lot easier for us to do big family vacations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy entire family has been calling me selfish and a jerk for not being more open about the points but I feel that work very hard to get to the point levels I have gotten to and that making them more open for use would burn through them quickly and not allow them to be used for bigger things.  \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676587960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1143nkj/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_about_all_my/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can\u2019t take that money to grave with you.\u201d Y\u2019all need to find the balance that gives you the space to take trips. \u201cYet\u201d may never come.", "But it should not be entirely up to him how every penny is spent. He's the breadwinner, but only because you take care of the children and everything at home. You should also have a say in economic decisions. You should not accept that he just says \"not yet\". You both should be open to a compromise, maybe not do a trip every year, but every other year, or cheaper trips, for example.\n\nYou should not have lied or went behind his back, but on the other hand, he seems to not respect your opinion and steamroll all over you.", "Totally agree about forgetting to enjoy the now. And I think both of them will eventually be kicking themselves in a few decades but... Not my place to make a stink about that.\n\n\nI saw her comment about it, and I'm sure they've literally discussed saving and retirement. I guess what I'm curious about is... Does the husband think she's totally on board with this plan and happy (even if she's occasionally brought up vacation) or is he like \"fuck you it's my money.\" Like if she's hiding it because she's worried he'd take her money away or punish her somehow, then I don't blame the hiding. But who knows", "They both get 7.5% of personal spending money a year on what she said is over $150,000 a year. 7.5% of 150k is $11250. Each. There is no reason they can't go on a family vacation with $22,000. Something is definitely wrong here, but I don't think it has to do with him being uptight.", "I don\u2019t live in any of those areas, and $150k with 4 kids isn\u2019t much.  Especially since he has to save for both of their retirements and 4 kids worth of education.", "They both get equal amounts of spending money and the bills are paid. She's lying to get more for her how is husband overbearing? She's a manipulative liar.", "So you take extra money from what you saved from your families money to spend on yourself? in what world do you think you\u2019re not an asshole for being selfish. Your husband was completely correct. Had you both been working the system and using those points together would\u2019ve saved a mush larger amount of money and you could\u2019ve gone on family trips. If you don\u2019t think being able to retire at 50 and then the two of you can go off and do what you want while ensuring your children have not only a major boost after college with the ability to go to college in general without paying a dime you\u2019re fucking stupid.", "If you two have about $22k between you for fun spending, why couldn\u2019t you two save for a vacation?  Is he spending all of his fun money so you would have to shoulder all of the cost?  Also, why didn\u2019t you take the kids on your trips(unless I\u2019m reading this wrong, you went alone right)?", "Based on this, YTA. You guys can totally afford a yearly vacation with even one person\u2019s 7.5%. Instead, you lied to multiple people so you can use the rewards points from the 50% household expenses to go on a personal vacation.", "He controls where every penny goes and when she voiced her financial need/want for family vacation he wouldn't allow her a choice. It's clear she doesn't get a financial say, that's a pretty clear indication of financial abuse. That and feeling like she had to squirrel away these points instead of being honest isn't a good sign.", "But yet, they dont get to go on vacation and see things.  Setting them up is fine but not if it means stopping them from experiencing other parts of life.", "\"He decides where every dollar and cent goes.\"  Yes, she gets an allowance.  Look it up, it's still financial abuse.", "Yes, they get an even share (amount that she can't change anyway), but she also have no say in doing holidays and such (as confirmed in comments and main text). She has no say in what direction the family goes everytime it involves money. He is the one controlling where all money goes and she can't have a say.\n\nIf this is financial abuse or not, I don't know. For sure it isn't ideal. She should have a say to how to fraction the money and if an super, super early retirement is worth never having a single family holiday. As of now, she can't make decisions because he is the one managing the money so I don't agree it's a rare situation where SAHM is treated equally . At the end of the day, she only has her 7.5%  share, while he makes decisions on all the rest of the money.", "I am a man, dummy.", "This. The points and money she gathered would have been taken and controlled by him if he knew.", "You used points gained from shopping to get yourself something your breadwinner husband wouldn\u2019t have approved of, instead of having a discussion about how to spend the family\u2019s money, so it sounds similar to me.\n\nETA: Also you lied about your vacations for years, while my mom hid the TV in the guest room and we watched it there with her until my dad eventually figured out what was going on. We weren\u2019t poor. My father didn\u2019t consider TV necessary or worth spending money on.", "Yes", "As a fellow Canadian, I feel a strong desire to say \u2018sorry\u2019 to everyone for having to read and judge your stupidity. No question about it, YTA. \n\nThis speaks a lot to your character and who you are as a person. You should seriously consider getting help because you have a problem.

I did the math when Bernie Sanders was talking about Universal Healthcare for us Americans, and I would get $7000+ a year BACK in my damn pay check.

Doctors appointments and each monthly prescription are $40 a piece. Nearly everything else that's covered still only pays 80% of it, so an expensive surgery can get ugly.\n\nMy husband makes good money, but the only reason we aren't struggling is because I receive secondary insurance coverage due to disability. It pays the 20% not covered by the main insurance. It also pays the $40 fee to see a doctor, and some prescriptions are much more affordable. Only took two years and sitting in front of a judge to receive it \ud83d\ude05\n\nDespite all that, there's still plenty that isn't covered, or you have to fight for said coverage.

Both of our families are a similar size with mine being 6 and his being 5.", "I'm not saying she's not an asshole, because she absolutely is an asshole for lying, I'm saying even without her lying 150k for 4 kids, unless they live in San Francisco, is enough money to go on a camping trip for the weekend lol or a short weekend away at like...a local winery...while the grandparents look after the kids. Even if they did live in San Francisco one weekend trip to Napa over a nine year period should absolutely be doable!  Same with camping...you can camp for like $250 max, even with four kids, in many places in the US. \n\nThat sounds like an incredibly dull life to never have a break, never have a tiny vacation. \n\nThe point is leaving aside the 'rewards money,' he sounds incredibly, incredibly uptight. Yes, saving money for the kids education is important, but he can't rework the budget and say subtract a small percentage from the fun money and education for them to go on a camping trip (which can be a couple hundred bucks, at most, in many places) or a winery trip once or twice over the period of nearly a decade.", "He should now because she's a liar who manipulated everyone to get herself a vacation", "That's the thing...why is he saying he can't afford to take a vacation with the guys unless it's covered and why isn't he telling her they should put x amount of money towards a vacation? He should be able to afford a vacation, too, with that money. IDK, him saying that and the absolute rigid budgeting (and not even a % set aside for 'fun family time') does make me think it's him being super neurotic or uptight to the point he deprives himself of having any fun. \n\nAnd I could see the 11k adding up if she covers her own health insurance (a bad plan can run $700 a person a month, even though that's unusual), car payments, etc.", "$150k is pretax, I would assume.

She gets 7.5% of his income - as does he. It sounds to me like she doesn't understand the idea of saving for 4 kids, and neither do you.

Good lord.", "This is not an allowance, it is a budget that covers all day-to-day expenses and ensures both she and he have equal amounts of fun money.

Then telling him they paid for it, and then telling her family her husband paid for it. \n\nThis isn't an AITA from him and his budgeting, it is AITA for using the points she earned from doing household things on herself and lying about it to everyone.

IDK. Like her family treating her, the kids, or them as a family on a group trip would be one thing, but to just cover him alone?", "Right because if she told anyone then it would either be \"leave him\" and she wouldn't have the means or funds.
