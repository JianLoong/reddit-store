We have 2 kids of our own (6 & 4) and my wife has a daughter, Mary, from a previous relationship (16F).  My wife and her ex have split custody and this year was supposed to be her ex's year to have their daughter for Xmas.  But Mary has been fighting a lot with her dad lately because she feels he is too strict.  In my opinion, he's not, but that doesn't matter.  He just has different rules for her when she's at his house and Mary thinks that isn't fair.\n\nSince Mary was supposed to be with her dad for Xmas, we made plans to fly out of state to visit my family for the holidays.  But last weekend Mary was at her dad's and they got into an argument.  Mary came back to our house and told us that she doesn't want to spend Xmas with her dad anymore.  My wife immediately jumped to say that Mary can just come with us instead, but it isn't that simple.\n\nMy wife and her ex have a clause in their custody agreement that requires approval of both parents to take Mary over state lines.  This clause was specifically requested by my wife at the time their agreement was made.  We've asked for and gotten Mary's dad's approval for vacations before and vice versa.\n\nI reminded my wife of this and said that she's going to need to talk to her ex before we make any travel plans for Mary.  She called her ex and he said he still wants Mary to spend Xmas with him and that he wants to try and talk with her to smooth things over.  Mary says she doesn't want to talk to him at all.  My wife explained this to her ex and he said he will not give permission to take Mary with us on our trip.  He said he understands Mary is mad at him, but he doesn't believe that it's fair that we take her with us for the holiday when it's supposed to be his time with Mary.  His main point is that Mary spent the past 2 Xmas's with us.  Last year because of their custody agreement and the previous year because of Covid restrictions.\n\nPersonally, I completely see his point.  Mary is mad at him but he still wants to work it out and spend the holidays with her.  My wife thinks he is being vindictive and not looking out for Mary's best interest.\n\nMy wife wants us to now change our plans and stay home instead of going to see my family.  I told her I absolutely do not want to do that.  We've had these plans for months and I'm looking forward to seeing my family for the holidays too.  It's been 3 years since we've spent Xmas with them.\n\nI suggested to my wife that all of us sit down and talk about this and work something out so that her ex and Mary can spend the holiday together.  But she got mad at me for \"taking his side\" instead of supporting her and Mary.\n\nBoth my wife and Mary are now pissed at me for not wanting to change our Xmas plans to accommodate Mary.  I'm not expecting everyone to be happy about this situation, I'm just trying to find a compromise that brings us back to our original plans.\n\nEDIT:  The reason Mary is mad at her dad is because she feels his rules regarding her curfew and car use are unfair.  Mary has a driver's license, but no car of her own.  When she's at her dad's, he only allows her to have one friend in the car with her at a time.  He also has an 11pm curfew for her on weekends.  She stayed out until almost 1am the last time she was there and they argued about it.

I understand seperate parents can be difficult but at the same time your wife should be encouraging Mary to have a relationship with her father and to not simply use your house as a tool whenever mary is mad at him. If he isn't abusive there is no reason to not simply tell Mary to go back home and to work it out with her father. \n\nI agree you should all sit down and find common ground but your wife needs to stop enabling her dauther.

It\u2019s a shitty situation for sure, but it\u2019s a pretty petty argument that\u2019s happening between Mary and bio-dad. Like others have said, it\u2019s a teenager trying to bait one parent against the other to get their way, and mom is enabling it (at least by the context here). \n\nPeople seem to be forgetting there\u2019s also two other YOUNG children in this equation. They have a right to have their desires for Xmas respected as well. Who are having their plans unilaterally affected by one person\u2019s temper tantrum. OP doesn\u2019t want to do something illegal and explicitly laid out in the agreement. Yeah should the agreement have been adjusted over the years to accommodate the increasing independence of Mary, yes, but that ain\u2019t gonna magically happen now a week before they leave. \n\nLook both bio parents need to back off here realistically. Dad needs to recognize he might have to lose the battle here to have a chance of restoring a more normal relationship before she\u2019s legally an adult, Mom needs to wise up and recognize that letting this weapon work once is gonna get it turned back on her at some point likely. They should sit down and lay out consistent rules about the car/curfew to take that leverage away from Mary; dad to relax and mom to tighten up.

That is just wrong.  And as late as it is, I have a feeling that you'll lose a bundle on the airline tickets; is Mary going to make that up to you somehow?  She needs to go to her dad for the holiday and work things out with him.

In 2 years, she\u2019ll never have to talk to or see either of her parents if she doesn\u2019t want to. Her dad needs to realize this and lighten up.

Don't say you're looking for compromise when your end goal is to stick with your original goal. \n\nYour wife should sit with ex and daughter to work things out. Mary is also 16 years old and doesn't have to adhere to custody agreement. She is old enough to make her own decisions and she can cross State lines. I think family lawyer needs to review the case and advise if this agreement is even valid any longer. You can't force a 16 year old as if she is 6. Lastly, Mary needs to grow up and understand that until she pays the bills she must abide by her father's wishes while in his home.", "NHA, it's a difficult situation and there won't always be peace and harmony.

The easiest thing *would*be to take get with you, but the custody clause prevents that.\n\nYour wife is an AH for suggesting your family cancels plans that have been months in the making just because Mary is arguing with her dad.

That's NOT compromise. That's \"my way or the highway.\"\n\nI hesitate in calling Mary an AH because she's only 16, but she's also old enough to understand that the rules will ve different for her when she's at dad's house as compared to mom's house. Again, though, Mary and her mom and dad need to sit down together and talk about this. At 16, there probably should be some loosening of the rules so Mary can start to experience decision making. The rules don't need to go away entirely, but I suspect she's chaffing against some that could probably be loosened IF THEY TALK ABOUT THEM CALMLY.\n\nI don't really know enough about the dad from this, but he's on the right track with wanting to talk things over with Mary and trying to solve the problem. That said, if after talking things out Mary still doesn't want to stay with her dad, she's old enough to make that decision for herself and it is probably time to revisit tye custody agreement. The clause DEFINITELY needs to be removed at this point, given Mary's age.\n\nI hope you can work this out, but you may need to change your plans. That sucks, nit that's what happens with kids.

Mary needs to grow up a little and stop acting like a spoiled brat.", ">\tShe is old enough to make her own decisions and she can cross State lines.\n\nI would double check with a lawyer from OP\u2019s state before saying that for sure. She is still a minor so the interstate part may still apply.", "I've never heard of that and by 'that' I mean that a 16 YO can unilaterally decide they're not following a court order.", "At least in my state you are incorrect. At 16 Mary is old enough to be asked what she wants in a custody hearing and for the judge to give that a lot of weight in any decision - but she does not automatically get the right to decide. Custody agreements can still be enforced.", "Completely disagree. OP is planning on spending time with his family after 3 years.  He's an AH because he's excited about that? Mary is 16, and way too old to be so uncompromising. Unless physical violence occurred with her father, Mary needs to grow up and make amends with her father. \nIs she never going to speak with him again? Is he dead to her? Or did he tell her to clean her room and do her homework. If OPs wife is going to abandon her husband on the holidays then she should be required to cover her portion of the costs.", "No. He's willing to take her, he wants everyone to work together as parents to make a decision, whether she go or not. Dude hasn't had Christmas with his family in 3 years, he doesn't have to give that up.", "A good compromise should leave everyone involved feeling at least a little bit disappointed that they didn't get everything they wanted.  That's the kind of solution I'm hoping for here.", "100% agree. Grandparents don\u2019t come before children. Change your plans.", "like in foster care or something", "Well of course they aren't putting the 'wants' of Mary first. She's not the only person in the family and, hey, there's a court decree that says Mary doesn't get a say in some things. Like who she spends the holidays with. What a way to let children manipulate their parents. 'I'm mad at him so all of you guys have to change your plans.'", "So because she's pissed at her dad, for seemingly nothing he's actually done, she gets to force everyone to go against a court order? What if her parents weren't divorced? Should everyone then arrange plans with other family so she can punish her parents for having rules on the holidays?", "Why should Mary\u2019s wants come before everyone else\u2019s? There so many more people in the situation, and their wants are just as valid as hers, if not more so for some of them. Mary isn\u2019t the center of the universe.", "I mean it depends.\n\nIf she doesn't want to spend time with her dad because she disagrees with his rules , and they are reasonable rules then it's setting a bad precedent.", "Yes. This kinda sounds like a comment from someone close to 16.\n\nAssuming the OP isn't leaving out important details about the fight, it sounds like the usual \"I'm too old for your rules\" argument that's totally normal. Bad precedent to teach kids its ok to cancel vacations over that sort of thing. She wouldn't even have that option if they were married.", "Until the kid is legally an adult, it's still the parents and their custody agreement", "Yeah definitely not the asshole. Your wife is a huge asshole. Those are normal rules. She is purposely trying to alienate her daughter from her father.\n\nShe better pray that her ex doesn\u2019t take her back to court for parental alienation.", "Tell Mary there will be no car use and a 9pm curfew if she goes with your family or if your wife stays home with her. If Mary only doesn\u2019t want to spend Xmas with her dad cause he\u2019s got rules, that\u2019s not even close to being a valid reason to break custody and ruin plans.", "I agree, hence why i recommend a family lawyer to look at the agreement and provide advice", "Family court allows ages 14 and up to decide what they want. At 16 she can chose to not go. In many States, 16 is considered adult enough to make decisions. So yes, they can chose not to go. A judge would rule in the 16 year old favor. I know a few people where this has happened in different states over the years. My niece is one of them.", "In CT, NY, and NJ, they rule in the 16 year old favor. In CT, parents are stuck. I know from experience per my comment about the niece.", "I'm not calling him an ah for being excited. I'm calling him an ah for saying \"i want to compromise\" and that compromise being \"everything should go the way we've planned.\"\n\nWe don't have enough information about the issue between Mary and her father (or at least I don't) to make a call on whether or not someone is overreacting. However, I do think that if Mary can't/doesn't want to stay with dad (and at 16, she's definitely old enough to make that decision), the solution is to bring her on the trip and if dad prevents that put of petty revenge against Mary, then's he's an ah, and arguably the largest one.", "Except the way you get disappointed is not having your original plans met...which means staying home.\n\nYou getting what you want is not a compromise on your part in any way.", "Absolutely not! You can't claim compromise and expect your outcome you seek. That sounds just selfish and childish.", "She is a member of the core family, and parents who don't put their children's wants before their own shouldn't be parents.", "She's 16, she's old enough to decide who she spends her time with now, if the custody agreement hasn't been updated for that it's not her fault. OP is telling this story with extreme bias because he wants to paint himself in a good light and wants to take his trip.\n\nThere's not need to talk about hypotheticals and they just detract from the issue at hand. OP says he want's to see his family for the holidays, but Mary is his family and became so when he married her mom, and kids always come first.", "she's a child, parents put children's wants above their own.", "Exactly. If it's something like not staying up past 10pm, then sorry, Mary's going to have to suck it up and not completely disrupt her family's plans, or at the very least can't do that without some sort of mediation or compromise.", "It ultimately doesn't matter what the reason is. She's 16 and as such gets a say in where she stays.", "you really dont think a 16-year-old has any say when it comes to custody? kinda sounds like a comment from a moron", "i mean, not really, in most places 14+ is when kids start getting to make the decision regarding where they want to go custody wise. so 16 is well within the range of being able to decide which parent to spend a holiday with", "no 16 year olds are able to decide between parents she not property", "Ok, but that's not going to happen in the next 7 days before we are supposed to leave.", "You're saying that the court will listen to the child. That's not the same as them just deciding not to go according to the schedule.", "Not in all states. We tried for years with my stepson. They don't have to take anything that the child (and yes she is still a child in the courts eyes) says into account. And her saying that she doesn't want to be at dads because she has to follow his rules, most judges would laugh her out the door. If dad was abusive, neglectful or otherwise causing harm, sure they might listen, if she has proof, but again it depends on the state. Been through this with 4 boys, and several states. Most states will tell her she needs to follow the rules.", "Seems like if he had extreme bias here, he'd be painting the dad in a bad light to justify keeping her. And, again, what if her parents weren't divorced? Not sure how it's that different? And kids coming first doesn't mean they get whatever they want. This just sounds like a spoiled brat who wants to punish her dad for normal parenting.", "No. Parents put children's NEEDS above their own.\n\nMy kids want a lot of things that aren't reasonable. I'm not going to give them everything they want just because they want it.\n\nIt doesn't even sound like dad minds taking Mary along on the trip, as long as her dad gives consent. Until Mary is both 18 and financially capable of doing what she wants, she's going to have to deal with both mom and dad.", "I just read one of OPs comments, Mary has an 11pm curfew which she went over, dad reprimanded her for it, they fought now she doesn't want to be with him for Christmas", "It does matter.\n\nShe doesn't want to spend time with her dad because she doesn't like to follow his rules.\n\nIf they let her do this, she will refuse to see whatever parent she is mad at, or whoever grounded her or whose rule she doesn't agree with", "That still has to be legally part of the custody agreement. When a child is 14 they are allowed to give their opinion to the judge but it still needs to be finalized.", "But this 16 year old cannot because the contract says that both parents must agree for her to leave the State, and bio dad is not giving permission.", "Hence why I said consult a family law attorney.", "Interesting.  I agree definitely depends on the State.", "no he's painting the dad in a good light because he wants Mary to stay with him so his plans don't get changed. He's not valuing mary's feelings on the matter at all.", "ngl I'm glad my parents were better to me than you are to your kids. I also said the dad sucks though, f he allowed her to go everything would be great, but since he doesn't it's on OP to change plans.", "Oh jeez. Ok yeah, Mary and mom are being AHs. This is typical teenage girl doesn't want to have rules stuff, I say that with confidence as a former teenage girl with divorced parents.", "And that is her right to decide who she spends time with and who she doesn't. Forcing time together makes people resentful and wrecks the relationship. Treating her with respect and allowing her to make the choice of where she is for Christmas has a better chance of improving her relationship with her father then forcing his wants and choices on her does. Quite frankly, the ex needs to respect Mary's choice to not want to spend Christmas with him, doing so will teach her that he respects her as a person and won't undermine her wants and needs.", "I think Pennsylvania was the worst. She was literally starving the kid (16 year old boy and only allowed a half sandwich for lunches) he went to his GAL, even his school counselor, and the judge brushed it off because his mother said that he wanted to come to us because he didn't like the rules and his new stepfather. He came to us the summer he was 17 (turned 18 in July) and just never went back. He's also no contact with her.", "Because her feelings aren't the only ones that matter! And he's also fine with taking her, but can't do it legally. You just sound like you're protecting all over this.", "No, because she reason she doesn't want to be with her dad is because she broke the rules and he didn't allow it \n\nShe doesn't get to manipulate her parents by refusing to see them for correcting her when she breaks the rules \n\n\nBy allowing her not to go spend Chris with her dad they are validating her disobedience", "hers matter more. and I'm not projecting at all I don't personally relate to anything going on here. Parents have a duty to put the children first. and OP and the dad are both putting their wants over hers. Which is the wrong thing to do. At least she has her mom on her side.", "How do hers matter more than everyone else's here? Putting your child first means putting their WELLBEING first, not giving into their every desire. That's actually BAD parenting. And her mom sounds like she's more jazzed to screw over her ex than to have her kid.", ">hers matter more.\n\nMy 2 youngest kids are really excited about going to grandma and grandpa's for Xmas, am I supposed to tell them that their feelings and wants are less important than Mary's?", ">How do hers matter more than everyone else's here?\n\nshe's a child\n\n>Putting your child first means putting their WELLBEING first, not giving into their every desire.\n\nnot every desire but certainly Christmas is one that it should impact.\n\n> That's actually BAD parenting.\n\ncaring about your kid is bad, got it\n\n>And her mom sounds like she's more jazzed to screw over her ex than to have her kid.\n\nit didn't sound like that at all. She just wants her daughter to do what she wants. Like a good parent.", "the 6 and the 4 year old? yeah, they're so young you can easily reframe staying with Mary instead as something exciting. Their emotions are based of yours.", "Why do you keep bending over backward to make Mary the most important person here? You talk about parents putting kids first and foremost ALWAYS but say the, arguably more vulnerable, 4 and 6 year old deserve that less than Mary? 4 and 6 is old enough to remember that time your Xmas was trampled on to suit your estranged older step sister in 12 years\u2026", "Oh, so lie to them in order to prioritize Mary.  And also disappoint my family who have been looking forward to this visit for months.  All because Mary is pissed at her dad for having an earlier curfew and restrictions on her using his car."]}
