We have 2 kids of our own (6 & 4) and my wife has a daughter, Mary, from a previous relationship (16F).  My wife and her ex have split custody and this year was supposed to be her ex's year to have their daughter for Xmas.  But Mary has been fighting a lot with her dad lately because she feels he is too strict.  In my opinion, he's not, but that doesn't matter.  He just has different rules for her when she's at his house and Mary thinks that isn't fair.\n\nSince Mary was supposed to be with her dad for Xmas, we made plans to fly out of state to visit my family for the holidays.  But last weekend Mary was at her dad's and they got into an argument.  Mary came back to our house and told us that she doesn't want to spend Xmas with her dad anymore.  My wife immediately jumped to say that Mary can just come with us instead, but it isn't that simple.\n\nMy wife and her ex have a clause in their custody agreement that requires approval of both parents to take Mary over state lines.  This clause was specifically requested by my wife at the time their agreement was made.  We've asked for and gotten Mary's dad's approval for vacations before and vice versa.\n\nI reminded my wife of this and said that she's going to need to talk to her ex before we make any travel plans for Mary.  She called her ex and he said he still wants Mary to spend Xmas with him and that he wants to try and talk with her to smooth things over.  Mary says she doesn't want to talk to him at all.  My wife explained this to her ex and he said he will not give permission to take Mary with us on our trip.  He said he understands Mary is mad at him, but he doesn't believe that it's fair that we take her with us for the holiday when it's supposed to be his time with Mary.  His main point is that Mary spent the past 2 Xmas's with us.  Last year because of their custody agreement and the previous year because of Covid restrictions.\n\nPersonally, I completely see his point.  Mary is mad at him but he still wants to work it out and spend the holidays with her.  My wife thinks he is being vindictive and not looking out for Mary's best interest.\n\nMy wife wants us to now change our plans and stay home instead of going to see my family.  I told her I absolutely do not want to do that.  We've had these plans for months and I'm looking forward to seeing my family for the holidays too.  It's been 3 years since we've spent Xmas with them.\n\nI suggested to my wife that all of us sit down and talk about this and work something out so that her ex and Mary can spend the holiday together.  But she got mad at me for \"taking his side\" instead of supporting her and Mary.\n\nBoth my wife and Mary are now pissed at me for not wanting to change our Xmas plans to accommodate Mary.  I'm not expecting everyone to be happy about this situation, I'm just trying to find a compromise that brings us back to our original plans.\n\nEDIT:  The reason Mary is mad at her dad is because she feels his rules regarding her curfew and car use are unfair.  Mary has a driver's license, but no car of her own.  When she's at her dad's, he only allows her to have one friend in the car with her at a time.  He also has an 11pm curfew for her on weekends.  She stayed out until almost 1am the last time she was there and they argued about it.

It\u2019s a shitty situation for sure, but it\u2019s a pretty petty argument that\u2019s happening between Mary and bio-dad. Like others have said, it\u2019s a teenager trying to bait one parent against the other to get their way, and mom is enabling it (at least by the context here). \n\nPeople seem to be forgetting there\u2019s also two other YOUNG children in this equation. They have a right to have their desires for Xmas respected as well. Who are having their plans unilaterally affected by one person\u2019s temper tantrum. OP doesn\u2019t want to do something illegal and explicitly laid out in the agreement. Yeah should the agreement have been adjusted over the years to accommodate the increasing independence of Mary, yes, but that ain\u2019t gonna magically happen now a week before they leave. \n\nLook both bio parents need to back off here realistically. Dad needs to recognize he might have to lose the battle here to have a chance of restoring a more normal relationship before she\u2019s legally an adult, Mom needs to wise up and recognize that letting this weapon work once is gonna get it turned back on her at some point likely. They should sit down and lay out consistent rules about the car/curfew to take that leverage away from Mary; dad to relax and mom to tighten up. But this isn\u2019t really OPs fault, and they seem genuinely intent on finding a best possible solution, while still being honest about their, extremely reasonable, desired outcome.", "So your 2 kids do not get to see their grandparents for Christmas because the teenager is not happy about her father's rules ? \n\nYour wife is OK with that ?", "NTA.

That is just wrong.  And as late as it is, I have a feeling that you'll lose a bundle on the airline tickets; is Mary going to make that up to you somehow?

In 2 years, she\u2019ll never have to talk to or see either of her parents if she doesn\u2019t want to. Her dad needs to realize this and lighten up.

Don't say you're looking for compromise when your end goal is to stick with your original goal. \n\nYour wife should sit with ex and daughter to work things out. Mary is also 16 years old and doesn't have to adhere to custody agreement. She is old enough to make her own decisions and she can cross State lines. I think family lawyer needs to review the case and advise if this agreement is even valid any longer. You can't force a 16 year old as if she is 6. Lastly, Mary needs to grow up and understand that until she pays the bills she must abide by her father's wishes while in his home.", "NHA, it's a difficult situation and there won't always be peace and harmony.

The easiest thing *would*be to take get with you, but the custody clause prevents that.\n\nYour wife is an AH for suggesting your family cancels plans that have been months in the making just because Mary is arguing with her dad.

That's NOT compromise. That's \"my way or the highway.\"\n\nI hesitate in calling Mary an AH because she's only 16, but she's also old enough to understand that the rules will ve different for her when she's at dad's house as compared to mom's house. Again, though, Mary and her mom and dad need to sit down together and talk about this. At 16, there probably should be some loosening of the rules so Mary can start to experience decision making. The rules don't need to go away entirely, but I suspect she's chaffing against some that could probably be loosened IF THEY TALK ABOUT THEM CALMLY.\n\nI don't really know enough about the dad from this, but he's on the right track with wanting to talk things over with Mary and trying to solve the problem. That said, if after talking things out Mary still doesn't want to stay with her dad, she's old enough to make that decision for herself and it is probably time to revisit tye custody agreement. The clause DEFINITELY needs to be removed at this point, given Mary's age.\n\nI hope you can work this out, but you may need to change your plans. That sucks, nit that's what happens with kids. Emergencies happen, plans change. The kids come first. Always.\n\nEdit: Many of you seem to be taking offense at me calling OP an ah. Please understand that I am ONLY calling him an ah for the compromise comment. He is the smallest ah of the group and is, honestly, in a shitty situation. Unfortunately, as a result of that situation, if Mary refuses to go with her dad, short of OP and wife driving her to dad's and forcing her to go, which would be detrimental to their relationship with her and I doubt wife would go along with it, then OP has two options for the holidays: (1) cancel the trip entirely and celebrate with Mary at home (wife's choice) or (2) OP takes the kids on the trip and leaves wife home with Mary. Neither of those is what OP really wants. The 1st option sucks, the 2nd would ve considered a compromise.\n\nUltimately, instead of trying to stay out of it, OP should tell his wife and Mary that they need to have a sit down conversation with dad and talk about why Mary is upset with dad. We don't really have any information on that to know whether it's normal teenage angst and chaffing against normal rules or if it's something else.", "YTA - For this line in particular:\n\n\"I'm not expecting everyone to be happy about this situation, I'm just trying to **find a compromise that brings us back to our original plans**.\" \n\nThat is the exact opposite of a compromise.", "NTA.

All that said, Mary is  old enough to have a say and at the end of the day if she still refuses to go to her dad's, that has to be accommodated.

Didn't go back for a year and by the time I had my parent's were divorced and left again at 17 because my dad was also too strict.", "I feel like rules around the car and curfew should be the same at both houses. Do you have kids from a previous marriage not mentioned in the post around the same age that would be affected by enforcing the same rules as her dad? The same rules in both houses will make all your lives easier. And I say that as a former 16 year old girl with divorced parents.", "I agree with this. Mary should have the same rules at both houses when it comes to the car and curfew. It's fine to take a break from one parent if there is constant conflict, but the ground rules need to be the same and Mary shouldn't dictate what the entire family does.", "So she even broke the rules that you have for her at your house. And your wife wants to reward her essentially? Your wife needs some lessons in parenting.", "I mean, it's working up to your wife having split custody of 2 more kids unless you cave......", "I don't think that's an unreasonable curfew either, FWIW. However, your wife and her ex really ought to have more consistent rules AND consequences for Mary that they both agree on. At 16, she should also be a party to those discussions. There'd probably be much less friction if all 3 have an agreement to uphold instead of a teen playing both parents against each other. This is co-parenting 101.\n\nAt the very least your wife needs to understand that she needs to uphold her ex's rules and punishments if he's willing to do the same for her. And unilaterally violating the custody agreement is going to cause a bad time for everyone.", "Oh please. I'm on your side here, but the fact is that going to visit your family or staying home are all-or-nothing propositions, there is no major compromise to be had here.", "What about the 4 and 6 year old? Where do their desires fall on the totem pole of relative importance here?", "Where I live, you can\u2019t drive without a fully licensed adult until you are 17, and the first two years you are only allowed one person in the vehicle with you who is not a direct family member, so yeah that she is throwing a strop over that really is ridiculous. 11 pm isn\u2019t that bad for curfew either. If she thinks it is to early she should sit down and make a logical, calm presentation to her dad on why he should allow her to have a later one with examples of how responsible she is and backing statements on other times where she proved she is capable of acting like an adult.. not this tantrum nonsense.", "She's not allowed to drive with more than 1 friend in the car and has an 11pm curfew on weekends and didn't get home until 1am weekend before last....\n\nSooooo unreasonable /s\n\nPretty sure I understand why OP is siding with the EX. He doesn't want to live full time with a 16yo girl that's allowed to do whatever she wants. Such a great example for his own kids.", "An elven pm curfew is and one friend in the car isn\u2019t strict. That\u2019s a reasonable boundary for 16 yr old child.", "I do not have kids from previous relationships, the 2 kids I have with my wife are my only children.  I completely agree that the rules should be the same at both houses, but since Mary isn't my child I can only offer that opinion and not enforce it as a rule.", "Wise suggestion.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to call OP an asshole because he doesn\u2019t wanna commit felony kidnapping but that\u2019s just me. He\u2019s been pretty clear he has no problem bringing her, but won\u2019t violate a court order.", "The top because they get to see their sister.", "Lol better not always put your kids' wants first. You have to raise them. She has to listen to her dad.", "It doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s a minor. Everyone else\u2019s wants aren\u2019t less important than hers.", "I also believe they aren\u2019t supposed to drive between 11pm-6am for the first year.", "Where I live you can get a learners permit at 14 1/2 and my family has a similar rule I\u2019m 18 and have been driving for 3 1/2 years and even though it\u2019s my car (I bought it) I\u2019m still have a curfew and rules about my car the Dads rules are not crazy at all", "Where I live you have to be 18 to get a driver license. I remember when I was 16 and wanted to be later than curfew I would have my father wait for me outside the club or wherever I was and go home together. What a dad!", "I think it\u2019s not necessarily the curfew that\u2019s her problem but more the concept of having rules to obey instead of doing what she wants.", "\nNTA. It honestly sounds like your wife LIKES Mary being mad at her father because of the way.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "That's fine. But mom and Mary need to stay home. Mom needs to follow HER parenting plan.\n\nIf Mary truly does not want to be at her father's anymore, they can go to court, and present their case to the judge. Depending upon where they live will determine whether or not Mary has full say, or if the judge listens to her \"reasons\" and makes a determination based on her statement. Mary sounds like the typical whiney 16 year old trying to play both sides of the field.\n\nOP is NTA", ">She's 16 and as such gets a say in where she stays.\n\nAnd if the other parents can't or won't take her?", "Nope. Her parents don\u2019t have to play that game.", "It depends on the state and county", "My state is 18. And yes, parents get scolded for not making their children follow it.", "I'm not talking about boundaries or arguing anything regarding rules her father set, the deleted comment that I responded to stated that she should be treated like a 16 year old.  I was out there making decisions much earlier than 16 and SHOULD I have had to do that no, but was more than capable of doing so.", "Man, that really puts you in a tough spot. Does Mary have a therapist you can enlist for help on this? I feel like your wife is being really unreasonable and trying to be the cool parent rather than trying to work with her ex (crappy as he may have been as a partner), they have to get aligned on parenting. I wish I could put you in touch with my step dad, he's been there. \n\nI think the suggestion of your wife staying home may be something to consider. If you can help her find a way to work with the ex while letting your wife know you're firmly in her corner, so that everyone is on the same page and to keep Mary from running the show, that would be ideal. One parent being super permissive won't go well for any of you, including Mary in the long run, same with one being overly strict. Doesn't sound like dad's rules are out of line though.", "And I never called him an ah for not wanting to take Mary. I only called him an ah for calling what is clearly him getting exactly what he wants and everybody else being happy for it a compromise. That's not a compromise. That is the opposite of a compromise. Nowhere did I say he should ignore the custody clause. I DID say it would be nice if, after Mary and her parents talk and if Mary decides she still doesn't want to go to her dad's, then her dad would agree to let her go so that she could join them on the trip. But that's only if dad agrees. Otherwise, she doesn't get to go on the trip. At that point, OP and wife have two options: (1) cancel the trip (wife's choice) or (2) OP and kids go and wife stays hone with Mary.", "They see their sister all the time, they aren't excited to see her.  They are excited to see their grandma and grandpa who they haven't seen in person in 3 years.", "But not their grandparents who they were excited to visit", "it sure as fuck does", "especially because its a matter of safety and responsibility! his rules are SO reasonable; he doesnt want several ppl which could easily be distracting, and for her to come home safe. hes literally just setting boundaries to make sure she doesnt get hurt and the car doesnt get crashed.", "NTA, if your wife wants to stay home, I'd just take the younger two with you. No need to disappoint them because their sister wants to be a teenage delinquent and cry to mommy.", "Careful. You are going to ruin your relationship with your bonus daughter. Is it worth it? \n\nShe is 16 and has divorced parents. It sounds like she doesn\u2019t get much say or control in her life (due to age and the situation). Stay home, get a refund on your tickets and visit your parents next month. \n\nAs a divorced parent with two teenagers I would stay home with my daughter and it would be a red flag if my partner wasn\u2019t able to adapt, pivot or adjust his plans to accommodate. The way parents choose to handle their children\u2019s teenage years have a lasting effect and let me warn you- they will not forget. \n\nYou\u2019re being a brat. I\u2019d ditch your ass (for the holidays) and put my child who is very obviously struggling first.", "Given the nonsense you\u2019re spouting in this thread, I promise you that nothing about the way you\u2019ve been raised is \u201cbetter.\u201d", "So he gets to unilaterally decide she gets no Christmas celebrations? He\u2019s manipulating the custody arrangement.", "Letting her play her parents like that isn\u2019t going to help the situation.", "You sound rediculous. She is upset because she broke simple rules she was expected to follow. Her mother made and agreement with the father that they need approval from both parents to cross state lines. Father doesnt agree so now the other father has to miss a 3rd christmas with his family? A 16 yo doesnt get to dictate what they do for christmas because SHE broke rules. It doesnt work like that. And what do you suppose that teaches a 16 yo? She already undermined her fathers rules she doesnt get what she wants in this situation.", "That is so disturbing.", ">I\u2019d ditch your ass (for the holidays)\n\nSo you agree that me taking the 2 youngest kids to see my family for Xmas is a reasonable solution.  That way my wife and Mary can still be together.", "To hell with what his kids want, or his parents want, right?  Its all about what she wants, and her daughter  wants?\n\nThis is a terrible take and encourages Mary to be a brat.\n\nThe argument between Mary and her father, btw, are about her curfew (11pm, which is reasonable for a 16yo driving her parents car) and how her dad won't let her have more than one person in the car at a time (again, reasonable for a new driver).  \n\nOp said this particular argument started because Mary broke curfew by coming home at 1am (TWO HOURS later than her 11pm curfew btw).  \n\nThe only one being unreasonable here is Mary being unwilling to talk to her father about his (reasonable) expectations for his teenage daughter.", ":)", "Where are you getting no Christmas at all? Her dad wants her at his house to celebrate, it's not like OP's just gonna dump her at a shelter. And how is him wanting his daughter over for his actual scheduled holiday time manipulating anything?", "He\u2019s not though. Mary\u2019s dad WANTS to have Christmas celebrations with her.", "We're did you get that idea?", "They sound like a 16 year old with divorced parents who enjoys playing their parents off each other to get their way.", "As a parent more so. The kid came to us at 120lbs and 6 foot tall.", "Can you just take your kids with you to your extended family,  and Mary/Your Wife can stay here?\n\n\nIt's not ideal but at least you and the smaller kids don't miss out on grandparents time.", "No, mom wants to go against dad, undermine his authority. Daughter has to learn to obey her dad. If it was a bad nasty dad, sure, put her first, but he did nothing wrong. It's important that she has a good relationship with her dad. My son didnt want to go to his dad anymore, because he was very strict and he thought he didn't love him. I said he's just old fashioned. Just listen to him, do what he says. Then he doesn't have to put you on the hall. And I lied that he called me yesterday and said that he loved him so much. Then daddy was the man and he wanted to go extra to him."]}
