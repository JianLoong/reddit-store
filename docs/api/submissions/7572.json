However, my husband knows the owner and has promised he would make another reservation before we went home but my sister doesn\u2019t want me to be invited as she thinks I\u2019ll ruin it again which I think is an overreaction.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673975213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ehdvn/aita_for_ordering_pizza_even_though_we_had_dinner/", "score": 6720, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Order enough pizza just for yourself then, why order enough to make everyone full?

You say \"When the pizza arrived, everybody wanted some\". That, to me, implies that no one said they wanted pizza before it was delivered. So you only ordered some for your husband and yourself? But the rest of your family, consisting of at least two parents, got enough pizza to also be full? So you ordered enough pizza to feed at least 4 adults even though you had dinner reservations? You don't sound like an asshole, you sound like an idiot.\n\nYTA. Your sister didn't even eat pizza because she thought you guys would still go, so I can only assume she had nothing to eat and had to fix something for herself. I'd be pissed with you too.", "YTA, you absolutely made it about yourself. And you are still doing so.\n\nYou had reservations at a difficult to attend place and, in getting the pizza, you clearly made a second dinner and ordered enough for everyone to eat, sabotaging the previous plans.\n\n* If you don't want to go, say so before the evening of the dinner. Flaking out two hours before you head out to an exclusive location reservation is pretty assholeish.\n* If you need a snack to tide you over while pregnant, ordering pizzas is clearly not appropriate in this scenario. Something small and, frankly, healthier for you and your child could have tided you over.\n* ***Edit Addition:*** *Also, as many below have pointed out, if this place is that hard to get into you've essentially wasted both your chance, someone else's chance for that table, and the restaurant's limited space. Which: not great!*\n\nWhat you did here was ruining previous plans in a petty, undermining way and your lack of forthrightness with it makes you an asshole in this situation.", "YTA - I\u2019m so tired of pregnant women coming on here and pretty much trying to use their pregnancy to justify being a dick. While it\u2019s not entirely your fault that everyone decided to eat the pizza instead of going out to eat, you could\u2019ve just had a snack to tide you over until dinner", "YTA.  You craved pizza all day and waited until 5:45 to order some--and it arrived how long before you all were supposed to leave for the restaurant?  And ordered so much that everyone ate until they were full?", "YTA. Jesus, OP. Get a small snack. You are a grown adult. You can last a couple of hours, even when pregnant. Pizza was over the top.", "YTA - you did not go directly becuase you ordered pizza. You said it was hard to get a reservation and you cancelled last minute. I bet your next reservation is sitting by the bathrooms.", "YTA (you + your husband followed by who ate)\n\nyou should have quietly ordered your pizza (slices of) without making it a \"pre-dinner\" thing. Saying you were craving for something since you are pregnant, exactly how you write here. Instead, you confirm in comments you have ordered large pizzas, clearly for multiple people. De facto changing the plans without even having the courage to say it directly. I guess she knew the plans were canceled like one before the reservation time, more or less. It wasn't nice. \n\nIn short, you were TA for \"I order various large pizzas. But of course *wink wink* if nobody wants that now, I'll eat the excess later, even if I have ordered for everyone so....\" because OF COURSE you implicitly changed the dinner plans doing so. At that point, everybody was pushed to eat pizza, you clearly wouldn't have finished the pizzas alone and you ordered it for everybody. As adults, we need a bit of ability to predict things.\n\nThe others eat, but you build the situation and I'm not even that sure you actually didn't predict the outcome tbh. Especially because you confirm in comments that the attention in these days is all for you. I'm sure your sister is understanding the dynamic very well.", "YTA.  If you so desperately needed to have pizza right then and there you could have ordered a personal pizza, but you chose to order enough pizza for everyone to eat obviously ruining the dinner plans.  Most people don't eat 2 different dinners on the same night.  You obviously didn't feel like going out and chose to ruin the plans.", "Yta", "YTA", "YTA. Wow, how incredibly rude of you. Honestly how rude of your whole family. Being pregnant doesn\u2019t mean you get what\u2019s you want, whenever you want.", "YTA- this was an easy one", "YTA - there were so many other solutions to this problem other than order a pizza and ruin dinner. You could have made yourself a snack or gone and gotten fast food. You made the whole night center around you and what you wanted instead of considering what was best for everyone", "YTA. Even being generous to you and saying you absolutely had to have your craving met,  you know pizza bites are a thing, right? You could've even just gotten a small frozen pizza. You didn't need to order a whole pizza, let alone enough pizza too leave 4 adults too full to go out to eat in a couple of hours.", "YTA. You could've gotten one slice somewhere or limited how much you ate. Quit using pregnancy as a crutch to get your way. \n\nAnd you have zero remorse for your sister, who was waiting to eat at a restaurant that's difficult to get reservations for because \"pregnant\" & she didn't get to eat there. Just because of you. And your family are AHs, too, for enabling you.", "YTA\n\nYou could have had a snack, made a sandwich, a salad, etc\u2026and that would have taken care of being hungry. Have pizza the next day or have it earlier in the day for lunch. \n\nYou ordered a dinner before dinner. Your husband excused it because you\u2019re pregnant.

I think everyone has explained why.", "INFO was there a particular reason you guys were going out to dinner?

You ruined dinner plans.", "YTA, u had reservations if you crave pizza then get enough for yourself not enough to feed the entire family and spoil the plans. That said the blame also lies with your family cos who stuffs themselves with pizza when they know full well they have dinner reservations?? That\u2019s just rude", "Well that was a dumb thing to do.", "Omg. YTA, so much. Eat a damn banana if you\u2019re hungry, or go have a pizza slice by yourself if you\u2019re having cravings.

Why couldn\u2019t you ordered a small pizza just for yourself?", "YTA - and it\u2019s obvious. You are an adult. You could have gotten pizza earlier in the day, or waited till after your dinner to satisfy the craving. You ruined your sister\u2019s night and don\u2019t want to be held accountable.

There's at least 4 people in this story maybe more. Apparently OP is crazy hungry, yet ordering a single pizza feeds OP, husband, and her dad?", "Why not both", "This was absolutely a job for bagel bites or pizza pockets.", "i usually eat dinner between 10:30pm and 12:30am. People who work different shifts have different eating schedules. I dont think the time of the reservation should even be a topic of conversation here lol. OP is a massive asshole for ruining the reservation when she could have just eaten a banana and waited for dinner.", "The replies say she ordered two large pizza, no way it was not planned.", "I am not sure it is not the A and neither is sister but everyone else is.  I picked up heavy snacks for my wife because of cravings in both pregnancies,  but no one else had them.  It had no impact on any plans.  Her husband ordering enough for everyone and everyone eating was the problem.", "Same, no one forced the rest of the family to eat a full meal. It honestly just sounds like the sister was the only one who actually wanted to go to this restaurant.", "Plus every pregnant woman I know keeps an emergency snack in her purse.", "Yeah I don\u2019t really get the comments saying she ruined everyone\u2019s night. They all chose to eat pizza and not go out?", "It\u2019s first time pregnancy bullshit and I partially blame movies and television who have made this a trope.", "I have also not read a case study where it says that everyone has to eat pizza just because one person orders it. She could've put the rest in the fridge and had it the next day.\n\nIf I was sister I would be a lot more disappointed in the rest of the family than OP. I would feel momentary rage at OP but I'd personally feel that the rest of the family was worse.", "Probably have another kid.", "OP's about to have a whole ass BABY to exploit. If I were her sister, I'd just cut contact now.", "She sounds like a Golden child so I don't think she'll need to do much...", "You know the answer is keep having children she cares little for because they draw attention away from her.\n\nBabies as therapy animals! Cute until it's hard work.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 take my award \ud83e\udd47", "Exactly.  Anything to ruin something her sister wants to do.\n\nThis wasn't about pizza.  This has everything to do with the attention somehow being taken off of OP, and OP's determination to be the star in everyone's world.", "For real. I love going to nice restaurants for the first time, especially with a group as it means ordering and tasting way more dishes. If someone in my family pulled this on even a normal evening I'd be livid. But the way OP dismisses her sister's feelings I do wonder if there's some other reason for sabotaging the evening.", "Especially if it was a place I've really wanted to go to and there was little chance that I'd be able to get reservations and go on my own another time", "Yeah, if the sister is so upset but no one else seems to care about missing the dinner, it definitely feels like it's more than just the sister really wanting to eat at that restaurant.\n\nAnd intentionally getting enough pizza for everyone to stuff their faces only a couple of hours before a reservation at a restaurant? There's just no way this is just about OP wanting a slice of pizza.", "100% there is info missing. Hell, OP didn\u2019t even mention she was pregnant until the end.", "Right? I'm positive there will be some buried explanation. \"Ok so the dinner WAS for my sister who just graduated medical school but I'm pRegNAnt.\"", "And she says in another comment it's difficult to get a reservation at that particular restaurant. So the restaurant need to try and fill the cancellation and understandably her sister is disappointed something she was looking forward to was cancelled last minute.", "I came close once in all 9 months. Of all things I wanted a hot dog with mayo (?) but there was none in the house. My dad offered to make some, and I realized how silly it was and went to bed. I can\u2019t imagine ruining group plans for it. \n\nOp, YTA", "I\u2019m pregnant with my third and it\u2019s this shit from OP that pisses me off to no end. Her and others like her make everyone assume we\u2019re uncontrollable beasts when pregnant which causes people to treat most pregnant women like we\u2019re walking lunatics. I\u2019m just over being invalidated.", "Yep, I had major food aversions whilst pregnant but I still went to people's birthday meals and found something to eat.", "Crazier still, ***A*** pizza filled up a family of 4 (or more) to the point they couldn't eat again over 2 hours later??\n\nHow big was this pizza?", "Same I ate milk duds daily. I get the cravings thing.  But this is just bad behavior.", "been pregnant twice, currently 27 weeks with my second. Have I cried into my husband's arms about wanting Taco Bell? Yes. Have I selfishly ruined my whole family's dinner plans because I want pizza? Fuck no.\n\nYTA", "If I had a midnight craving, you bet your ass I got in the car and drove myself to the store. Some of these stories are straight bananas", "3 cheers for salt n vinegar chips!", "Salt and vinegar chips were my thing, too! Early on, they were one of the only things I could eat without getting nauseated, so the day we were closing on our condo, we had to stop on the way to get some and I sat there the whole time, signing grown-up documents with my other hand wrist-deep in a can of salt and vinegar Pringles.", "Ooh good take on the situation.", "It's what I was taught in mom school. \"Eat an apple. Have some carrots. Drink some water\"", "As someone currently pregnant, they can get pretty strong but if its unreasonable, I just cry into my pillow till it gets better or the next craving comes and overrides it. Its my own problem and doesn't turn off the logical part of the brain \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\n\nMine are like a flash of memory of the smell/taste/texture and everything in me wants to eat it and I start literally crying if I'm going to get some out of happiness or whine out of despair that its unreasonable to aquire.\n\n\n(I'd be eating so much salmon sashimi right now if I couldn't control myself, but its bad for the tater tot, so tears it is)", "Durning my first pregnancy after breakfast one morning at work I suddenly decided that I needed broccoli (which is a fine vegetable, but I\u2019d never gone out of my way for it before) and spent a few minutes figuring out where I could order DoorDash from to get broccoli with my lunch. And then I got back to my day waiting the few hours until lunch with no problem. It was surprising, but not all consuming.", "I think it varies. With my 2nd baby I would involuntarily (silently) cry every time a craving hit me (super embarrassing when you\u2019re at work). It never meant I needed to indulge right away. With the other 3, it took up headspace, but not to the point it was anyone else\u2019s problem.", "I drank whole milk during my pregnancy. GALLONS of it. \n\nI don\u2019t ever drink cow milk, and even as a kid the whole kind was too thick.", "Pregnancy cravings are a very common thing across many cultures and time periods. \n\nIt's such a common thing that in Japan companies have worked to develop \"pregnancy-friendly sushi\" for pregnant women. \n\nFilipino culture has a word for it, even.", "I mean, it really depends. I've never been one to have a huge appetite but once the Hyperemesis Gravidium (basically chronic nausea/vomiting) passed, I had the strongest craving for apples. I lived in NYC at the time and the cheapest way to get groceries was to order via Fresh Direct. One time I ordered three kinds of apples, apple cider, apple crisp, apple pie, etc. After pushing my kid out there was a several year period where I couldn't stand apples because I ate so many. With kid #2, all I wanted to do was eat ice, which turned out to be a sign of an iron deficiency.\n\n\nStill, I never acted out of line if I couldn't get what I was craving right away.", "I had ridiculously strong cravings because I have an autoimmune disorder that makes me nutrient deficient even without a baby getting part of the nutrients I consume. I didn't make it anyone else's problem, but I did cry over vegetables more than once.", "She admits to ordering two large pizzas.  \n\n\nShe knew what she was doing.", "Because she clearly wanted to ruin the dinner plans.", "and for general advice, don't exploit it for stupid shit.  You need that pregnancy brain credit for the real dumb moves.  Like, hypothetically speaking, telling your work team lead that you didn't do the first-Friday-of-the-month analysis because today is June 31 so obviously it would be due next week.", "Absolutely correct! Apparently no one BUT the sister wanted to go out if they\u2019d fill themselves with Pizza and cancel.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I was thinking too.", "Exactly.\n\nMy daughter is pregnant with her first and hasn't needed to hijack special plans for the rest of the family. She can walk into the kitchen and have a snack & still keep our plans", "Ew, what? That shouldn't make sense for her to do, but she probably would. And you're right, it's really disgusting. To change the plans because of you not wanting to be there is selfish and rude. I understand being socially burnt out/too tired to do something.\n\nBut when I'm in that situation, I have 3 options: 1 - I can suck it up and go along, and talk to people consistently the entire dinner (not recommended, but sometimes necessary for when having family or friends you haven't seen in a long time) 2 - I can go, but tell people I'm a bit tired, so I'm gonna take breaks, and I'm sorry if I put on my headphones, I need downtime. 3 - Just fucking skip it, they'll be next time!\n\nCancelling the entire thing, (not even outright, just through manipulative means) is so unbelievably rude.", "Omg I'm choking", "That baby gonna be named Kaylee or Daxton/Grayson/Jaxon or some shit like that.", "As others have mentioned as well, in demand restaurants often blacklist people for late cancellations and often require credit card deposits for groups. Big no-no", "And they may be blocked from ever placing reservations there again, depending on policy.\n\nEveryone is an asshole here except the sister. She deserves a better family.", "This exactly.\n\nThere's no way they ordered a reasonable portion of pizza to satisfy her craving but it was also magically enough to completely fill up an entire extended family to the point that they cancelled dinner reservations hours later.\n\nA quick snack to tide you over would be a small pizza, or individual slice. To fully feed this many people you had to have ordered multiple large pizzas.\n\nEven everyone on your extended family eat two slices wouldn't be enough to have them all say cancel the reservation, I'm just too stuffed to eat more three hours later.\n\nThis  seems entirely premeditated.", "Sabotage sounds right. OP is YTA, pregnancy is not an excuse to be rude to others.", "Yeah, I agree. Sis was probably looking forward to this and had been anticipating it for awhile, given it\u2019s hard to get reservations.  Op should have gotten a slice by herself in private instead of getting the whole family involved\n\nOp, YTA. Apologize to your sister sincerely. Pregnancy doesn\u2019t mean you get to be the center of everything or ruin occasions for others.", "I was pregnant with twins. I ate \n\nwhat I wanted when I wanted. I was sick for most of it. If my face wasn\u2019t looking inside the toilet, I did what I could regarding eating. I\u2019m saying YTA. \nMy stomach touched the steering wheel and I have long legs. \nMany times I just went for functions and did not eat. It was understood. \nBut feeding the family when you know they have plans? \nNo. That\u2019s F-Ed up. \nYTA.", "She ordered 2 large pizzas, that's about 20 slices.\n\nShe \"conveniently\" neglected to add that detail in her post.", "Yup, that was me. I craved chalk like none other. I believe it\u2019s called PICA.", "Same. Currently pregnant a second time and sometimes I\u2019ll crave things, but I can just easily say.. eh I\u2019ll get it later. Same with my first pregnancy. It was never so bad I can\u2019t think or function", "My mom craved the smell of gasoline when she was pregnant with my older brother. Cravings absolutely aren\u2019t something you HAVE to have. Also, correct me if I\u2019m wrong but don\u2019t they go away eventually just like any other food craving?", "Oh man I ate so much taco bell while pregnant. I very much had strong cravings and if I didnt get a food it was constantly on my mind for days til I got it (extremely annoying to focus on food that much tbh) but I always went and got it myself. Drove to Taco Bell at least once a day for a few months in first trimester (the weight gain was real). One time craved funfetti cake with strawberry frosting really bad so I went to the store, got the mix, and made myself a damn funfetti cake with strawberry frosting at 10pm haha. So, I understand the pizza cravings, and I might've asked husband to do the same, but it would have just been one pizza just for me--aint nobody about to be allowed to touch my pizza! Or just get a pizza after dinner to bring home and eat to satisfy the craving. And I still would have been plenty hungry to go to dinner after too, so absolutely they're all assholes cuz the situation makes no sense besides intentionally feeding everyone and eating enough to miss dinner.", "My mom told me about craving pickles and ice cream (at the same time, supposedly). I think that the cravings are real because any sane person wouldn't even consider combining those two things", "And instead of walking leftovers to the microwave, you walk all the way to other side of the house and then stop and ask yourself wtf am I doing.", "I forgot the word \"hamburger\" for two days \ud83d\ude2c", "During my first pregnancy I was really craving cereal. I got my bowl of cereal and put everything away...or so I thought. The next day I went to get more cereal and I looked in the cupboard and found the gallon of milk and the cereal was in the fridge. THAT'S pregnancy brain.\n\nI've been pregnant 3 times. You don't give in to every craving you have. It's not that damn hard.", "Two large? Hahaha \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I\u2019m on my third! Congratulations!", "I don\u2019t disagree that it\u2019s bad form but apparently OP\u2019s husband knows the owner and he\u2019s going to make sure they get another opportunity.", "She ordered two large pizzas. \n\nThat's about 20 slices. \n\nSo IF, as she says, she only ordered enough in CASE people wanted some, if nobody did, she was going to eat two large pizzas by herself?\n\nShe's contradictory.", "So on top of all the weirdness, you\u2019re lying. YTA", "Agree - YTA.  Everyone cleared time in their schedules and made time for a special night and you ruined it.  If I had to guess, it's probably not for the first time, pregnant or no.", "\nOr everyone else wasn\u2019t intending to go out because they made the personal choice to eat the pizza as well. They could have just not eaten it. But they did.", "I totally think people get pregnancy cravings just like in non pregnant life, but I don't think it's something that should rule your life or put others out. Like making your partner run out at 3am because you have to have something specific or having them drive across god's green earth to get that one specific thing because you suddenly had a craving. There are poor people the world over that can't just go get a certain food item because they want to have  it, and they manage to survive pregnancy just as well as anyone else. Barring a medical issue, I think it's bullshit and spoiled behaviour that people indulge and use pregnancy as an excuse for.", "Cravings are real but they're not \"drop everything, I am incapable of basic discipline and focus\" real. I craved fucking confetti cake for a month before I actually got myself some. It's just persistent urge. It's not something you usually act on- out of convenience. OP fucking up a family get together is just scumbaggery.", "Ha! So true. My kids are 7 & 3 and I still do that!", "Also, why would she order enough to give other people, KNOWING they were all going to a nice restaurant together less than 2 hours later? Sounds like she didn't want to go and sabotaged it on purpose", "Same here but I don\u2019t have kids. Lol"]}
