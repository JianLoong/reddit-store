I told her it was fine if she stayed with me. Faith has never moved out of her parents and has a rocky relationship with them. She 'moved' in a few hours later and everything was ok.\n\nUntil that night. I was woken up to a loud sound coming from my guest room. I heard music and laughter, so I opened the door and there was Faith and some random guy hooking up. I told him he needed to leave. She started to yell that I embarrassed her and how rude I was. I told her that was unfair to say and left it at that.\n\nThe next day, my pantry was completely ransacked and there were trash everywhere. Me being a clean freak, I lost it. Faith told me she was sorry and how she needed to film a few videos and she clean it up. Faith is gorgeous and has a love for fashion, so she has gained a following on youtube (around 80k). She films these fashion videos, don't know details, but it makes her some cash. \n\nI let it slide for a few more days. It became normal for random guys to show up to my house or to hear her loud voice filming videos. When it had been a week, I told her she needed to leave. She started to cry telling me about she never really gotten into a fight, but really got kicked out, but she said she found a place just needed to gather her stuff. I told her fine and let it slide once again.\n\nWhen she still hadn't moved out, I finally told her she needed to leave. The trash and disrespect had became unbearable. She said she never found a place and to just let her stay. When I said no, she started to cry calling me a jerk and how she would complain to her 'fans' about me and get me hated on. I genuinely laughed. She refused to leave and I threatened to call the cops. She finally left and I did start to cry. I had lost my best friend. \n\nFaith had blocked me on everything so I don't know where she is at so I am worried but I feel like this is my fault.I told my sister everything and she called me an asshole and I should've let her stay for a little.\n\nNow I really feel like an asshole, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1669535807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5vaho/aita_for_making_my_best_friend_homeless/", "score": 476, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not suddenly her parent because you let your best friend move in with you. \n\nAt the same time, if she is really treating you the way you are describing, I'm not sure why you're friends at all, much less best friends.

It is not just something she was doing for fun and she needs that money more than ever.  It is basically the same as working from home.  You should have been patient with her on that front, though it was unfortunate that her job made noise.

I am just fed up, at this point, of people immediately suggesting there might be mental health issues when people exhibit shitty behaviour. The girl wants to bring random guys home all the time, make a mess and not clean up, and have loud music on at night while entertaining these randoms. That's a girl that thinks she can do whatever she wants, whenever she wants, and everyone else should just accept it.

It's not an excuse it is logic. And I get called a snowflake \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 projection much\n\nMental health can often make ppl act shitty.

It's not a hard concept lmao", "If its a pattern that made her family abandon her, that means it severely effects her life and by definition is some kind of DIAGNOSABLE(and often treatable) issue. That is how they decide between liars and compulsive liars etc. Maybe u should learn more in depth how it works and what I actually am trying to say before getting all pissy lol\n\nHow dare mental health advocates push for everyone being the best they can be within society.  Fuck those people we should leave em on a deserted island eh??", "She didn't lie because of an issue, she lied to manipulate op and get her own way. If she told the truth, op wouldn't of let her stay. That's not a sign of an issue. People like to get their own way all the time, they don't all have issues, and there is nothing, absolutely nothing in the post to suggest it's a pattern of lying. It's a pretty standard tactic of arseholes, to lie to get there own way, lie again in an argument when things go south, and then try to carry on as normal in the hope things blow over, and then continue getting their own way. Until being an arsehole becomes a diagnosable mental health issue, then there are no mental health issues going on here. \n\nIf I come across as pissy, it's because so far, I have met very few people who publicly claim to be mental health advocates that weren't just naive people looking to make excuses for people because they don't want to admit that some people are just shitty arseholes. The ones I have met, who were truly mental health advocates, sure as hell don't try and suggest mental health issues based on second hand (biased) information on anonymous websites. Go find someone with actual issues to advocate for, they might need your help. Nobody here does.", "A pattern yes that is what im trying to say. Why its clear she is ill. How am I advocating if I said I also wouldn't put up w it in my life lol I'd drop her too. I just said she's clearly not well\n\nSo you say irs normal to lie like that to the point ur own family disowns u??? Lmao wow\n\n I can give u a more dramatic example. My ex held a gun to my head in a fight. \n\nHe clearly has drinking and anger issues. Clearly not right in the head - mentally ill. I'm not gonna have him in my life but I hope he finds help bc I don't want his next partner to experience it. Why does that logic make u so mad ? It's genuinely odd. Punishment without addressing the issue is why we still have so many shitty people out in the wild", "The family didn't disown her because of lies, they disowned her because she is a brat thats horrible to live with. Two lies, the one about getting in a fight, and one about finding somewhere else to stay, are not a pattern. Not with only two lies. \n\nIn your little tale, the actions are extreme for the scenario, and way beyond normal levels of escalation for any reasonable person. In the OP, the actions are way more normal, just shitty. Very different things. One suggests obvious issues, the other suggests they're just shitty. \n\n\"How dare mental health advocates push for everyone being the best they can be within society.\"\n\nThis is the bit that implied you see yourself as a mental health advocate. If that was not your intention, fine, but your repeated assertion that she has mental health issues would suggest you see yourself as one. \n\nI can't be bothered to argue any further, I don't think we will ever see eye to eye on this one. You carry on seeing the best in people, and excusing away their shitty behaviour, I will carry on seeing people for what they are.", "OP=NTA\n\nwhat is wrong with people who can't show basic gratitude?", "NTA, and if she is threatening to slander you it could be dangerous. People online aren't always of sound mind, get a ring or some sort of outside surveillance to be safe.

I'm sorry for scaring you but I want you to keep yourself safe.", "NTA\n\nNot only did she take advantage of your hospitality, she lied to you multiple times about her situation, how long she was planning on staying, and that she had a place to go.\n\nFriendships are built on good boundaries and respect."]}
