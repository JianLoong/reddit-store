She has always been outgoing and I've been in her shadow. We joke about how opposite we are.\n\nRecently, she called me saying she got into an argument with her parents and needed a place to stay. I told her it was fine if she stayed with me. Faith has never moved out of her parents and has a rocky relationship with them. She 'moved' in a few hours later and everything was ok.\n\nUntil that night. I was woken up to a loud sound coming from my guest room. I heard music and laughter, so I opened the door and there was Faith and some random guy hooking up. I told him he needed to leave. She started to yell that I embarrassed her and how rude I was. I told her that was unfair to say and left it at that.\n\nThe next day, my pantry was completely ransacked and there were trash everywhere. Me being a clean freak, I lost it. Faith told me she was sorry and how she needed to film a few videos and she clean it up. Faith is gorgeous and has a love for fashion, so she has gained a following on youtube (around 80k). She films these fashion videos, don't know details, but it makes her some cash. \n\nI let it slide for a few more days. It became normal for random guys to show up to my house or to hear her loud voice filming videos. When it had been a week, I told her she needed to leave. She started to cry telling me about she never really gotten into a fight, but really got kicked out, but she said she found a place just needed to gather her stuff. I told her fine and let it slide once again.\n\nWhen she still hadn't moved out, I finally told her she needed to leave. The trash and disrespect had became unbearable. She said she never found a place and to just let her stay. When I said no, she started to cry calling me a jerk and how she would complain to her 'fans' about me and get me hated on. I genuinely laughed. She refused to leave and I threatened to call the cops. She finally left and I did start to cry. I had lost my best friend. \n\nFaith had blocked me on everything so I don't know where she is at so I am worried but I feel like this is my fault.I told my sister everything and she called me an asshole and I should've let her stay for a little.\n\nNow I really feel like an asshole, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1669535807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5vaho/aita_for_making_my_best_friend_homeless/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't reach out to her, she isn't worth it.", "NTA. It's your place, so your rules. You communicated the issue and gave her a chance to change her behaviour. If she's earning a living, she can stay in a motel. She's probably just angry that she's got to pay her own way.", "Nta, she disrespected your place and you", "NTA. It's your house, and she wasn't respecting it. \n\nI have a feeling Faith will bounce back. She seems pretty resourceful.", "NTA\n\nShe sure did not treat you like a best friend.", "NTA. Why would you let someone stay who so clearly disrespects you and your space?", "She doesn't see you as her friend. You are her - for want of a better word - minion.

Fucking disgusting!\n\nThird, your pantry was raided and trashed, because she wanted to film videos. What.The.Shit?!\n\nI'm sorry but the more I read about her, the more I'm pissed at you for letting it slide for so long. It's clear why she got kicked out of her house. \n\nIf she's complaining to her fans and doxes you online, sue her for defamation.

Sorry you had to experience this.", "NTA. One guess why her parents kicked her out.\n\nShe's acting ungrateful, manipulative and like a user. She's not acting like a friend, she's acting like a parasite. You should not have let her stay beyond the trashing of your pantry. And like a true parasite, once the benefit to her is finished she moves on and refuses to acknowledge you.

Once someone is moved in, whether there's a lease or not, you can't just evict them when you want, so watch out for any legal trouble you could get into.\n\nIf she \"moved in\", then it's her place, too, and she's allowed to have people over or to do her pastime that earns her cash, which if she's your best friend, you already knew about going into this roommate arrangement. You're not suddenly her parent because you let your best friend move in with you. \n\nAt the same time, if she is really treating you the way you are describing, I'm not sure why you're friends at all, much less best friends. This is a good example of why it's not always a good idea to room with friends or family. Easy to get into sticky situations like this.", "It's obvious why she was kicked out, her parents weren't putting up with her anymore.
