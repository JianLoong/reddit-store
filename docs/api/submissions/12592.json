The best example I could think of is the name Sarah. Most people meet a Sarah and just call her Sarah but close friends etc might occasionally shorten it to Sar if that makes. \n\nMy husband and I have never and probably will never call our daughter Sar. We have absolutely no problem with the nickname and fully accept when she goes to school her friends will probably call her that from time to time but we just don\u2019t naturally do it. None of our friends do it, none of my family do it and I don\u2019t think anyone at daycare does it so consequently she does not answer to it at all. \n\nEnter my in laws. We are not close with them and we only see them maybe once every few months. My daughter is not close to them but she\u2019s more than happy to see them and play with them when we visit. \n\nIt\u2019s actually gotten a bit awkward how constantly they call her Sar and she never answers to it. They will do it repeatedly. For example she\u2019s playing and they want her attention \u2018hey Sar\u2026Sar\u2026.Sar\u2026.SAR\u2026.SAR IM TALKING TO YOU\u2019.  At first husband or I would interrupt and say she doesn\u2019t know that name because we don\u2019t use it but they do it multiple times per visit so we just stopped and now we just have a giggle together afterwards about how dumb the whole thing is. \n\nNow where we might be the assholes is the last time it happened my MIL did it for so long that my husband interrupted and again told her she won\u2019t answer to it. MIL snapped that we should have taught it to her by now and we\u2019re purposefully being mean to the IL\u2019s by not teaching it to her when we know they like using it. Honestly I thought that was bloody ridiculous and brushed it off but when we recounted to some friends later they said they kind of agree and we might as well start using it because it would make the IL\u2019s happy and she\u2019ll likely need to eventually answer to it anyway. They said it sounds like we\u2019re not using it to purposefully upset the IL\u2019s which isn\u2019t true. \n\nSo are we the assholes if we stick to not using it?", "created_utc": 1679121662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ugooz/aita_for_not_teaching_my_daughter_her_nickname/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His birth name is Glenn, but when he was born, my grandparents thought he looked like a drunken sailor, so they nicknamed him Mate/Matey (as in, shipmate). They called him this all throughout his toddler years, rarely- if ever, calling him Glenn, so when they did rollcall in kindergarten, the teacher called \"Glenn\" a few times and nobody answered. My gammy had left a note on his lunchbox that he liked to be called \"Matey\", so when she called that, he raised his hand. He came home later that day confused as to why he never knew his name. To this day, my mom and all of his friends call him, \"Mate\" still, outside of professional settings. It might add a little confusion to her growing up, but nothing detrimental and especially nothing that should cause your IL's to freak out about. A name is a name, being only 3 years old, she cannot expect to resonate with anything other than ONE name right now. In a short while, she'll understand the concept of nicknames. It's ridiculous of them to put so much pressure on not only you as parents, but your daughter as a baby/toddler to be able to recognize her nickname. Also, it wouldn't hurt them to add the extra syllable from time to time, especially if they know she responds to it. It IS her name ffs.", "NTA - eventually your daughter will be old enough to decide what abbreviated names she wants to answer to. I actually knew a Sarah once, she would NEVER answer to \"Sar\" because she thought it sounded dumb. Most people either called her \"Sarah\" (it's not a long name) or \"Ra-Ra\" though I think this was just her besties.\n\nI can kind of see trying to say to her 'these people want to call you [THIS NAME] just once, and then if she still doesn' t answer to it, you can tell the in-laws truthfully \"she doesn't like it, please use her real name\" but that does seem unnecessary because you cannot predict how she will be nicknamed as she gets older. Abbreviated names are usually determined BY the individual eg \"My name is Stephen but please call me Steve\" or \"I'm Catherine but friends call me Kitty) etc and refusing to use the name the individual introduces themself as can be termed as a microaggression", "NTA nicknames typically come about naturally. They aren't forced onto people. Her nickname may not end up being \"Sar\" to use your example. People may end up calling her \"S\" or some other shortened version of her name. Just let it be.", "NTA- The IL's are being ridiculous. If they want Sarah to answer to Sar, they can wait until she's old enough to understand.", "NTA", "NTA. I know a little girl called Charlotte. Her mother really liked the name Charlie for a girl but  decided to put down Charlotte which could then be shortened to Charlie as a nickname. Well, little Charlotte does NOT like the name Charlie. Charlie is the stinky boy in kindergarten who picks his boogers and eats them. She does NOT identify as that name and good luck to anyone who expects her to come running when they call for Charlie.", "What a weird hill for your in laws to choose.
