His child is going to college in two years and he has the nerve to ask you to pay a major unnecessary expense for him? \n\nIf you can't afford a wedding then you don't have one. You go get married at the courthouse like all the other responsible poor adults. \n\nCharity is not meant for treats, charity should be used to cover necessities.

How is that going to make him feel? Children should be treated and loved equally and this screams the absolute opposite of that.  \n\nUsing his partner as an excuse sounds like a cop out. How his current partner gets on with his child to another woman is frankly none of your business. I also wouldn\u2019t really class a 16 year old as a \u201cchild\u201d.

So why is all the blame of her and future step mom having a bad relationship being put on step mom? There family issues is something they need to sort within themself as a family. Adjusting to being a step mom can be hard, and adjusting to HAVING a step mom can be equally as hard.

I would also tell him that you plan to put the money in a savings account for your granddaughter. That would be a much better use of your money.
