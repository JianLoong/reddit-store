Read about the family dynamic that takes place when you have a narcissistic parent. Your sister is the \"golden child,\" you are the \"scapegoat.\" This is a classic case, based on your description of your mother and her apparent reasoning for treating you the way that she did. \n\nStay away from your sister. She was not a good sibling to you and should have been calling out the obvious differences in how you both were treated. Don't waste any more time or energy on her. It probably made her feel good to treat you like garbage at your mother's funeral. Seriously, block her on all platforms and stay away, or expect to continue to get hurt.
