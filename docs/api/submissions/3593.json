She was not a good sibling to you and should have been calling out the obvious differences in how you both were treated. Don't waste any more time or energy on her.

I was her only child , she drank after my dad died . Her 2nd husband molested me and now sits in jail as a predator. I was called a liar by her. Your sister knows how you were treated and the purposely left you out of the loop. Fuck them. You go on and love your family. Those people aren\u2019t your family.

At no point has anyone thought about what it was like to be a child held to adult standards and never getting told well done unless there were numerous criticisms following it and none of them have anything to say about it besides blaming me for being a difficult child.
