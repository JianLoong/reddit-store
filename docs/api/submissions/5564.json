His reaction isn\u2019t just hilariously illogical, it\u2019s cold-hearted.  And now he\u2019s giving you the silent treatment.\n\nYour dude is a tool and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s making your life any less stressful or easier or generally improved (yep, these things occur in a healthy relationship).  Highly recommend you give him the mega-permanent silent treatment in return by breaking up with his stupid ass.", "y'all are in *high school* and he thinks you have to 'discuss purchases' with him?\n\nOh honey no. No no no no no no. That is beyond ridiculous.\n\nYour boyfriend has very weird ideas about trust and what it means to be in a relationship and what you owe him as a girlfriend. Trust an old woman, his attitude is very bad, and jealous, and his jealousy and possessiveness is going to cause you more unjustified grief. Reconsider this one.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your boyfriend sounds extremely immature, extremely jealous, and extremely, extremely controlling.  It's not his money, so it is none of his business. And this 3 days of not talking to you because you spent your money on something you wanted? Seriously reconsider sticking with this loser; I am sure you can do better.   Also, if you haven't given him a Christmas gift yet, skip it and tell him you are saving that money because of his whining about spending a lousy $140.00.", "NTA. The \u201cimmature\u201d comment makes me think that he\u2019s insecure and trying imitate what he thinks adult married couples fight about so that your relationship feels more \u201cforever\u201d to him. This is delusional and controlling.", ">we are both still in high school and do not share finances\n\nYour finances are 0% his business and this is super controlling behavior (and *he* is the one acting immature). There is also 0% this relationship will work out. He's making you feel bad at a time when he should be doing the opposite. Find someone who respects you and treats you right. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThis is literally NONE of his business and his controlling behavior is a huge red flag. Please do NOT keep up with this!", "Undermining of his trust? I'm sorry, **what?** \n\nYour friend literally died, and you bought something beautiful to remember him by. There's literally no universe in which your boyfriend's behavior is justified.\n\nNTA. Find a new boyfriend.", "NTA - you don\u2019t share finances and have absolutely no obligation to tell he before you purchase something. Get out now while you can - he\u2019s showing you that he is controlling, believe him.", "NTA. Your bf is immature and sounds like he's super controlling. You have your life ahead of you. Don't let this guy set you up for a complex.", "NTA\n\nYour ring is a beautiful memento of your friend. Your boyfriend is jealous of a dead person. He can get the fuck over that real quick, it's not his business at all how you spend your money.", "NTA\n\nHow dare he demand you get his permission to spend your money. You don't share finances and are far too young to do so.\n\nHe's acting controlling, and immature in not talking to you for 3 days. Bin him.", "NTA get out get out get out get out get out", "NTA... I am so sorry for the loss of your dear friend. This is HUGE red flag and you need to reconsider this relationship. Your boyfriend is being unnecessarily controlling and really immature. What you spend your money on is your own business. You had absolutely nothing to apologize for; he is the one that over stepped and needs to apologize.", "NTA. Sounds like your boyfriend is controlling. Huge red flag.", "NTA you're in high school, it's your money and he is trying to control you. Wake up before it's too late, this isn't healthy.", "It's your money and you don't have shared finances.

Him giving you the cold shoulder is immature, not buying something you want with your own money. Never apologize for doing something for yourself that doesn\u2019t affect anyone else.", "Nta", "NTA.

OP, this person is wasting your time. You\u2019re NTA, but he is a giant AH.", "NTA. Major red flag, as he is using your money to try and control you.", "NTA, run away quickly. If he's this controlling now, how will the future be? No one but you had any right to say what you do with your income.", "Honey, this guy is flapping his big old red flag right in your face. It\u2019s your money. Don\u2019t let him boss you around.

This boyfriend of yours is sending out a massive red flag. What you spend your money on is none of his business, you don\u2019t need to share your shopping decisions with him. I\u2019d very controlling behaviour.  If you were my daughter, I\u2019d be asking you to run for the hills.", "if you were adults with shared bills and expenses I would lean towards maybe... but since you are in highschool hell no you are NTA", "NTA. And not okay behavior, hear us when we say, break up with him, and do it somewhere there are other people.", "NTA. When you don't have combined finances, you're absolutely under no obligation to discuss your financial decisions with him. Seems like he's jealous/insecure and found a way to make you feel guilty about it.  \n\nWhile it's perfectly normal to have insecurities, it's absolutely not ok to make those insecurities someone else's responsibility/fault.", "NTA. Dump him immediately.", "Both of you are still in high school and he wants you to tell where you spent your money? Undermining his trust? Uh, no. Sorry. I think it's the jealousy talking. Either way, it is not immature. Your money, your rules.
