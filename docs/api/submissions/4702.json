It's kinda concerning that you get extremely tired with long walks at 18, this means either health issues or that you are extremely sedentary (health issues incoming). Make sure you are ok.", "NTA but if going on a long walk makes you \u201cextremely tired\u201d you should start exercising more just for your own benefit", "Well, you can ask them to have a vacation somewhere you want to go or mix activities. Like, you could go on vacation but you stay in your room \n\nNAH otherwise", "NTA. \n\nYou are an adult. You don't have to go on vacation with them.  \n\nI would make an effort to spend more time with them outside of vacation though.  It sounds like your family uses that time for bonding. If you aren't there then it may put a strain on your relationships.", "You're NTA. Just know that if your parents are anything like mine, they just genuinely want to spend time with you and share what they see as a special experience with you. I would recommend skipping this trip and enjoy yourself doing something you like, and the next time they want to go on vacation try to come to a compromise with them about somewhere you would like to go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Last place was too hot.", "NTA. Stay home and enjoy what you like. Have you tried talking to them about what you feel?", "NTA. Your feelings are valid and you\u2019re an adult able to make your own decisions. \n\nI do wonder if you have a form of depression, or are just developing into an adult and finding your way. Is there any vacation you enjoyed? Is there a vacation you would choose?  \n\nMy soon to be 18yo son doesn\u2019t like the beach but he looks forward to certain parts of our annual beach vacation. So we\u2019ve made it clear that while we do want him to go with us, we\u2019re genuinely like spending time with him, he\u2019s not expected to do everything with us. He gets to pick and choose and do other things he wants. If he chose to stay home I\u2019d be disappointed but understand. He also is choosing another vacation this year with me.", "NAH.\n\nYou're 18 and it's within your right to not want to go on a vacation if you don't think it will be fun.  Your family doesn't sound like they are abusing you or forcing you to go.  So nobody is really doing anything wrong here.\n\nThat said...you hate vacations.  You hate school.  You hate walks.  You hated the house.  I hope there are things that you like.  You might to consider whether there are ways to suggest making these vacations more interesting to you.  Eventually you may find that you regret not spending more time with your family while you can.  That doesn't have to mean you just go along with what everybody else is doing for the sake of it, but maybe you can talk to your parents about spending one or two of the days doing things that would make *you* happy.", "Nah\n\nJust say no and don't go. It's no big deal.", "NTA. Your reasons are absolutely valid. If they really wanted to spend quality time with you, they should discuss with you first, for instance, what kind of activity you'd enjoy doing instead of going on vacations (which they know you hate!).", "NTA, they should respect your wishes.", "NTA. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never been able to do something that you want on any of these family vacations, I can see why you\u2019d dislike them so much.", "NTA it may feel like you\u2019re disappointing them but try and be as honest as possible about why you don\u2019t want to (in the nicest way possible) and I think they\u2019d understand.", "NTA.\n\nYou definitely won't feel it now, but this is one of those things that you might regret 10 or 20 years down the line. I hope you can have a talk, in which you talk seriously and honestly about your issues and they listen seriously to them, so that a compromise is possible.\n\nIf not, then you tried. You have the comfort of knowing that and staying home.", "NTA, but what if you suggest a house up in the woods, with cooler weather, short hikes not on sand, lots of downtime for board games or Netflix with the family...", "**NTA** \n\nAt 18 it is only natural for you to want independence from your parents. \n\nHowever if you are still living at home keep in mind they may not want to leave an 18 year alone in their home and you will need to respect their wishes on this. \n\nWhen you get your own place you will have more leverage to plan separate vacations.", "Imagine going on vacation. You're pretty lucky. Just tell them that you don't like vacations.", "NTA. Not everyone enjoys vacations, and that\u2019s ok.", "NTA. If you make your wishes clearly known *and* make a point of spending time with them on non vacations, this is a perfectly reasonable boundary.", "I don't think my parents would be too mad at me, just a bit sad... But also I could use it to be more independent, haven't been home alone for more than a day before.\n\nI understand that I might regret it in the future but... It's just simply not something for me. I only really have bad memories from vacations, and most of the good ones come from home...", "I am sedentary + I have shortened achilles muscle, so I only walk on front of my foot.", "I have told them how I feel on vacations in the past, and they understand it. Haven't asked about staying home tho.", "I have autism and tons of sensory issues with it :/ My parents like stuff that triggers them... For example I'm really sensitive to sun and heat... I also extremally scared of bugs, so being on a beach with all 3 of them is just unpleasant experience for me. >~< I prefer stuff like closed pools way more but my parents prefer lakes...\n\nsummer is the worst season for me, as heat just kills my will to live. I just.. cannot stand heat qwq... It makes me really annoyed and I can blow up quite easily.", "That's what my parents don't like, they really like walking and sightseeing... .-.", "Independent is moving out and supporting yourself.\n\nIf you want to be home alone you get your own place.\n\nI'd kill for one last family trip with my deceased Father. No offense but you sound like a wet blanket. Don't go on a walk with your parents if you hate walks. I used to enjoy the hotel while my family did activities I hated.\n\nWas there any trauma from these trips? You're so vague about bad memories and good memories. I can still recall getting food poisoning from this food truck my mom and dad took me to. Not a great memory but I still keep this one in my memory because I was puking in a trashcan while my dad held my hair out of my face.\n\nIt might be a pain, but that stuff sticks when your parents go to an early grave.", "Well vacations aside, you need to start working on that with some kind of light exercise routine, because if you are unable to go for a long walk at 18 you are on pace to have very serious health problems and be unable to function as an adult. You are NTA for not wanting to go on vacation though.", "Piece of advice, that condition runs in my family. My father has it and all his bio kids and grandchildren toe walk because of it, including me and my children. While it Strengthens and stresses different points, unless you are currently undergoing treatment involving casts or braces it shouldn\u2019t be impeding your ability to walk or exercise. I understand that toe walking is sometimes embarrassing, my dad is 6ft 8in and built like Hagrid and walks on his toes. But the biggest long term risk with our condition is Scoliosis, And you are increasing that risk if you\u2019re not exercising and are spending too much time at a computer. From personal experience I recommend ballet or swimming they work with your pointed foot not against it.", "You should try talking to them about it. Hoping they would really understand you. I have also an idea maybe you guys could plan a substitute or alternative in which you guys could spend time together."]}
