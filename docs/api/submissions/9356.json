(which is A-okay you don't have to be best friends with everyone and my partner gets along with P and Q well)\n\nB got engaged last year, and has scheduled the wedding for this year, super happy for him, his fiance is lovely even if we've only met a couple times. \n\nHowever the wedding invite has just arrived and is just for me, not my fiance and my other friends have plus ones.(We knew it was coming as we were asked to save the date.)\n\nI don't really feel comfortable going alone, I can't drive and the wedding is a day after my own anniversary,  and I'd feel really crappy asking my fiance to drive me there only to not be invited, and the busses and trains are *way* too expensive at the moment to consider plus a hotel just for myself, not to mention how awkward it'd be as my friends would have their partners there and I'd be alone for a lot of it.\n\nI know my friends enough to know they would spend the entire time with their partners (as is fair, they love them) and I don't want to be a spare part on my own, I'm on the spectrum and suffer with anxiety and find social situations stressful unless I have someone who I can talk to comfortably, and struggle making new friends.\n\nWibta for declining the invite? I'd not mention the reason as that is their right, he isn't their friend and so I understand  but I can't help feel a bit awkward about it all.\n\nEdit: I will be contacting B later to ask about the invite respectfully, ask if the invite is just for me and whether it was an oversight, if it wasn't I shall just let them know I sadly can't go on my own as with my anxiety i would not cope too well with the travel and hotel which they know would be tough for me- I will send a gift with my love and hope it all goes well for them on the day.\nFingers crossed that works out and I don't lose a friendship!\n\nEdit 2:\nIt wasn't an oversight, it was intended due to spacing issues. I won't be attending but I don't think that it'll be any kind of issue either, we are still friends for now and are talking about my own wedding plans in the next 2 years.

It has nothing to do with how many times they met your fianc\u00e9e. It's just that rules should be equal to all guests, and if your friends are allowed +1, even if the +1 is a total stranger, so do you.\n\nMake it as if it was an oversight on their part.

If you determine that it is not simply an oversight that he does in fact not want her to attend. I think you\u2019re OK not going to the wedding. I do not think people are entitled to bring a plus one to a wedding in all cases.

B will likely be disappointed because he\u2019d appreciate your presence, but he probably won\u2019t take it personally. \n\nYour post makes it clear that you\u2019d like to be there, but there are a lot of obstacles in the way of you arriving there still in the headspace of being able to genuinely celebrate B\u2019s marriage\u2014 you aren\u2019t declining as a petty revenge tactic.\n\n(edited because I had some additional thoughts that I\u2019d accidentally left out when I originally posted)", "NTA. Wedding plus 1s are often a contentious issue. I do think it odd that you've been together nearly a decade and your fianc\u00e9 wasn't included but sometimes cuts have to be made I guess.\n\nOnce you've double checked it wasn't an oversight if the answer is still no then politely decline for reasons already cited and send a gift.", "So the short version is one of you is getting married, the other two got +1s and you didn't?\n\nHonestly that's strange enough that I'd ask them what's up. There's not going to be a good answer but I'd feel indignant enough that I'd want to see them try and justify that decision.\n\nAnd barring some kind of secret revelation, I wouldn't attend regardless of the answer.", "If this were a very close friend, I\u2019d say you should ask why your fianc\u00e9 was excluded, because it may really be a mistake.

This is a horrible situation to be in but to be honest, it sounds like they knowingly didn't invite your partner.  They must know about your situation if they're such good friends of yours.\n\nIt does sound like the couple doesn't feel like they want your partner there, which is perfectly ok.

It is probably  due to cost and headcount, for cost and venue capacity reasons.", "Thanks, taken on board, I'll message or call later on to ask, hopefully it goes well with either outcome.\n\nTotally outed myself but oh well lmao", "I think the exact opposite.   I think the people who reach out on child free weddings and say 'not MY kid, right' are the A H, and it is likely that this is not an oversight. \n\nDecline...if it is that big of a deal, the friend will ask about it.", ">Maybe include a line about how you could have possibly attended if you could have had a +1 like the other friends but since they chose not to do that, you have to regretfully decline.

I don't agree with only giving certain guests +1 and not others, but it's not my wedding so i can't call them an ah either. NAH and the friendship doesn't sound close enough to me to blow up like you've suggested. People drift apart, and it doesn't sound to me like the friend getting married is too concerned about OP attending.", "Oh lordy don't take this advice. It goes against all standard etiquette and you risk dinging the friendship.  NAH and you're not an asshole for not wanting to go and it's perfectly ok to make an excuse and not attend.  Send a warm note along with RSVP saying how excited you are for their marriage but you're not going to be able to make it. And don't feel bad about it... Wedding couples get squeezed on attendees for all kinds of reasons- space limits, budget, discomfort with big crowds. Since you live far away and don't do a lot of weekly/monthly socializing with this couple it's not unusual to hold off on a plus 1.", "OP has social anxiety - it would be beyond rude and ballsy for anyone to call and demand a plus one but it would be hell on earth for someone with social anxiety etc. This reply has chaos agent all over it.", "There's no ill will between them, I mentioned the differences as the other friends partners are definitely friendlier with him than mine due to the interests they have with each other my partner doesn't have (and can't really participate in as it's also related to the others careers.)\n\nIt's not a great situation and is definitely awkward but hopefully I can find a amicable way to handle this where I keep my friend as such even if I don't go to the wedding.", "He's offending you by not inviting your fiance as well.

Was B overly worried about offending you by not including a +1?", "Maybe B should\u2019ve been worried about not offending you instead of doing this weird passive aggressive move of inviting you and not your husband or boyfriend.

And not wanting to offend people isn't a bad trait per say, but you can't pour from an empty cup; sometimes you just have to consider your own mental health first.

He's been put in a inferior position in regard to his friends, so why not make it clear that this will hurt him?", "Ironically we live closer now than the other friends do to B haha\nI definitely don't want to burn bridges though, as although we are no longer that close I'd always do what I can for them if I'm needed and I'd like to think it goes both ways.\n\nI've not been to many weddings as the main invitee- usually it's my Fiance who gets the invites and I'm the +1 so this is new ground for me and the etiquette was lost on me.", "Haha I have trouble telling strangers who have seriously wronged me off, let alone a friend", "They've been a friend for over 15 years haha we met when we were 10- regardless of distance, we remained as such and although this feels like I'm being singled out, I'd like to think there's a reason and I don't want *them* to also feel bad.\n\nIt really boils down to me having to ask them about this, and as a coward I'm dragging my feet.

He\u2019s an asshole for not inviting your fianc\u00e9, plain and simple. Everyone else got a plus one, he either felt you wasn\u2019t worthy of a plus one or he did it purposely to let you know he doesn\u2019t like your fianc\u00e9 and to be toxic.

You're giving a gift for the newly weds.  As a \"child of the 70s\", you should know that by now.", "Ahh good. Respectful communication is nearly always the best path forward anyways and I hope this all turns out well for you.", "Lol that's fair!
