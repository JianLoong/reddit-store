My grandma was like that. When she grew older her children tried to get her some help around the house and every cleaner ended up quitting because she complained a lot. She doesn\u2019t do that anymore because she has some neurological issues that turned her into a fairly chill lady that just wants to sit, watch tv and talk about the garden and pets.\n\nMy mom saw her get so many health issues from housekeeping that she basically decided to never be like that and passed it on to me: \u201cBetter that the chores get done, even if it\u2019s not the way I would do it, than do it twice and complain.\u201d Your mom should learn that. Is the chore done? Good and forget about it. \n\nIf she\u2019s insulting you and your siblings, though, I would definitely never help, though and tell her so till she learns that manners are important.", "NTA.   \"I want this chore done a different way.\" is acceptable.  \"You're stupid for not doing this chore a different way\" is not.    \n\n\nMy mom is also super picky about how everything is done.  I'm in my forties with teenagers of my own, but my mother will come behind me and rearrange the dishwasher after I've loaded it.  She will take clothing out of my hands to fold 'the right way' (according to her).   It drives me insane, especially as she's getting older and really needs to not do everything herself, but if we're in her house I try to either do things her way or just support her while she does it herself, like rinsing the dishes and handing them to her to load into the dishwasher.    \n\n\nBut my mother doesn't berate others for not doing things her way.  She does redo them which can leave you feeling incompetent, but she would never call someone stupid for doing things differently than she does.   That is beyond controlling and into the realm of abuse.   I'm glad you stood up to her.  I would specifically call her out on the language she is using as well. \"I understand you wanted these clothes sorted a different way, but I am not stupid for doing it differently than you.   Please do not call me names.\"   Verbal abuse can be just as damaging, sometimes more so, than physical abuse.   No one deserves to be called stupid for doing a chore differently than another person.", "NTA \nyou just wanted to help out your sick aunt and that's not a bad thing at all.\nPlus it's just laundry it's not like you ended up making the clothes more dirty at the end. The fact that she doesn't even appreciate the fact that you helped her seals it she's in the wrong. \nMicromanaging on every small stuff n chores around the house is totally unnecessary.\nNTA", "SO ? I don't see why you would be the AH . you are finally old enough and independent enough to tell the truth . The problem is that we get taught that parents are always right and you have to respect them but in reality they are often a bigger mess than we are so they have to learn from us to change their way or at least get a reality check that they are the issue .", "This sounds like my mom\u2026 I feel you!

I know I'm a bit OCD when it comes to certain things but I realized it and I've learned to say thank someone for the help and let them know I appreciate the effort. I do have family members with major control issues though... I just don't bother helping them anymore. When they ask why I don't help, I tell them \"you are just going to get snit, grab it away and not appreciate it so why would I subject myself to that?\".  I've had the discussions with them and it hasn't changed a thing.", "NTA,\n\nMy Mother is quite similar in the kitchen especially. She\u2019ll complain that she cooks every night, but if someone else cooks, they\u2019re doing it wrong. It caused a lot of arguments in my childhood and teenage years, so I have a lot of sympathy for you.", "You are NTA. It would be great if you could help aunt find a better job. Maybe the constant criticism and belittling is what is making her sick. I would simply stop helping. When Mom complains, tell her that cleaning is a no-win situation and since you are going to lose (criticized and being called stupid), then you'd rather lose and just visit for a cup of coffee. Bring a treat to have with the coffee. Keep the visit short.  And, seriously, help aunt find another job!", "NTA\n\nYour mother was rude and abusive.

If she can\u2019t understand that she\u2019s creating a feeling of \u201cI can\u2019t please Mom, so why bother trying?\u201d, then she\u2019ll be equally puzzled when her kids want nothing to do with her.", "My step grandma was like that. She \"did a nice thing\" by letting me and my brother clean her house on the weekends for money, like $8 an hour. She told me what chores she'd like for me to do. She then yelled at me for the way I vacuumed and told me I was going to break her vacuum by... using it. Apparently, the crumbs on the carpet were too big to be vacuumed up (they were not. I'm aware some things are too big and cause clogs. This was legit like cracker and chip *crumbs* from my younger cousins.) Then she told me after I spent an hour cleaning her pink mold filled, rust stained bathroom that I \"didn't do anything\" and it wasn't up to her standards, and insisted my stepdad drive me back over to clean it again. Of course, he believed his mother and not me, so I had to go scrub non-existent germs off a clean bathroom. Then he wondered why I didn't want her to \"help me out\" anymore by letting me do chores for money. This is also the woman who told my stepdad it was okay that my brother couldn't make it one weekend to help, and she'd just find work for me to do. Then she proceeded to tell me to go do the chores he would've done, including mowing the lawn. They had a giant old gas mower that I couldn't start for the life of me- I was too young and small to get it going. She was highly annoyed, had her husband start it for me, then told me to get to mowing both yards. I could barely push the thing and my hands were covered in bloody blisters by the end."]}
