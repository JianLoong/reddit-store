She said she was too drunk, he said she couldn't find an Uber.  If she was on her phone looking for an Uber, she was capable of texting you that she was not going to make it home.\n\nThis is not about controlling her hangout.  This is about showing your spouse a modicum of respect by letting them know you won't be coming home that night.  That is how families generally operate.\n\nLook, I don't want to jump to cheating accusations.  Clearly this getting drunk with a single friend of the opposite gender and hanging out at his house all night is acceptable in your marriage.  That's... uncommon.  But maybe that level of trust is warranted.  Based on her behavior and attitude after, I would not consider it warranted.  But whatever - this is how you choose to operate your marriage.  What you did not agree to is sleepovers without communication.  It is a total reasonable boundary to have, and very much worth the argument.", "NTA. If this is a one off id say let it go. She was thoughtless in her behaviour but hopefully it was just drunkenness. She did apologise and it's never happened before and it's not some random new friend. \nBut if she repeats this sort of thing then I'd be worried\n\nEdit - missed the bit where she accused you of being controlling, that is a red flag.

Your wife went on a date with her male \"friend\" then got drunk and stayed at his house. Your assumption is she might have cheated which is fair though here me out. What if she was taken advantage of by said friend. He might have brought her back to his house S.A. her while she was drunk. Statistics show women are most likely to get S.A. by someone close to them. Before you go nuclear by ending your marriage, I think it best to established if she cheated or was S.A. by her friend.
