I would be in the office theater, playing various sports or hanging out. Since we work in broadcast media, everyone has a TV on their desk in office, and we would watch shows or sports while working. I make 128k annually, and I get travel perks, free streaming subscriptions, and great benefits. My primary responsibility is representing five clients on seven networks, scheduling their ads, and passing information to clients about these schedules as needed. Right before every quarter change, I have a busy week or two where the clients send me specifications, I book out the next quarter, and share all the data with them. The rest of the time, I wait for email requests for various files or issues and pull and respond as needed. I don\u2019t have any meetings or calls for my job, making my schedule flexible as long as things are done promptly. I\u2019ve taken on internal volunteer roles with various employee groups to fill my time during the days.\n\nMy husband works hard and makes A LOT more money than I do, and he\u2019s in the financial sector, so it\u2019s stressful year-round. I\u2019ll have maybe a week or two of my busy season four to six times a year. I work 50-60 hours per week compared to regular 10-25, and his busy weeks are 90+ hours compared to the standard 50-55 hours. I never complain about how busy he is and try to leave him alone, but in our home office, I\u2019ll always have my headphones on and a TV show while I work or clean the apartment/cook while I work. He sits working on and off meetings seeing me do this, and he\u2019s made comments, but the past week he blew up as I was booking our vacation for this year during my \u201cwork hours.\u201d We do the same vacation every year; I always offer to change, and I am always paying. Still, he says no; he loves what we do and wants to \u201ckeep the tradition\u201d versus trying a different destination, cruise, or another offering from my company. I was excited because I was booking us what would cost most people 11k for a two-week trip for around 3k. Also, because it\u2019s during his birthday week, I booked a tour he has wanted to do for years. I thought he would be excited, but he was so angry he stood up from his desk. He yelled at me, saying I don\u2019t respect myself by having an easy job that allows me to do anything but work and that I\u2019m a simple person mentally and a blowhard asshole for not wanting to be challenged or try a real job. He has gotten angry about a few other things I cannot control recently, and left for his parents for the weekend. I\u2019ve been with this company since I got my graduate degree, and I have taken two promotions in the same line of work while also changing clients and networks a few times, so it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t aspire for more.\n\nEdit - spelling", "created_utc": 1679180678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11v3uba/aita_for_keeping_an_easy_job/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean, who abandons their wife like that?  Did he actually go to his parents?  Sometimes when a man is straying, physically or emotionally they will try and distance themselves (by leaving) or picking fights over stupid things.  Their guilt is so intense that they feel justified if they can make you the \"bad guy\", or make you lose your temper, then they can say you started it.

You say your job is easy but belive me, if anyone could do it, they wouldn't be paying you 128k per year. They would have interns do it for a pittance. It may seem easy to you because of your skills but if you sell yourself short, people will treat you like your husband does. You should talk to your husband openly about what's really bothering him and maybe consider couple's therapy. But many men are threatened by women who are more successful than they are, and if he's one of them then his behaviour won't improve, I'm afraid.", "NTA. Keep the job that truly makes you happy.

I mean 128k with 10-25 hours, you also have all the benefits. Your husband works himself to a burnout and doesn't even have time to spend his earned money. He seems jealous that you can do all the things while he needs to work and proof himself day for day. But that is not a you-problem.

I don't want to dox myself with too much information or out my clients but like when I started I represented 35 clients ads on 3 networks and it was only about $800k in accounts managed per quarter on very low demand clients and now I'm managing five massive clients on seven major networks which is around $2.5 million in accounts I'm managing per quarter so I am compensated based on sometimes these clients run into needing data and changes at weird hours or non traditional times and I try to be mostly available for their needs 24/7. The combination of the location, experience, my increased education, and \"responsibility\" has definitely led to my current pay. \n\nMy husband has been with his company since Junior year of college \"working is way up the ladder\" often with an annual promotion following tax season and bonuses/pay raises twice a year. He makes close to 3.5x as much as me and definitely is in a position that requires that type of compensation due to the demand he faces.", "They live in NYC. 122k there is like 50k most places.", "They live in NYC.

That was the first time he's ever left for space from our apartment really and we don't really fight that much and now it's been two weeks and this happened again.\n\nI do know that he's actually with family. We were practically raised side by side so his family always has been my family before we were even married. He got to his father's home around 7pm on Thursday and has only texted me good morning and goodnight since, but today he went to my parents as they live by his father to help move some outdoor furniture and deal with a car problem. I really don't see how he could be cheating as we spend almost all of our time together and it's made it harder for him not being here because this isn't like him or us. He got upset a few weeks ago but he yelled this week and I had never heard him yell or go red in the face like this before. I really appreciate the insight and I'm hoping through these comments. I'll be more prepared for a discussion. I really appreciate everyone's concern for him cheating but I truly am not even worried about that as the thought had never even crossed my mind and he has been loyal to me all of our lives. I don't even know how to approach that concept.", "We got really lucky and had a family friend sell our current residence to us very cheap. We do not have rent or a mortgage in the city to worry about and I do own a car so our costs of living are parking, water, electric, gas, trash, public transport, and groceries which we could maintain on my salary alone. He makes roughly 3.5x my salary and uses it to help pay his mother and my parents mortgage (they didn't ask what we offered after renting for years and no longer having that cost), both his brother and my sister's tuition costs (they both graduate in May this year and had a ton of scholarships and that cost will disappear for my sister while we have already offered to pay for his brother to continue into medical school) and investing into savings accounts for our retirement and our future children. If it weren't for my company having a major tourist side and me getting the perks I do we probably wouldn't travel and because I get those perks and I pay for our annual vacation entirely out of my salary. We could in theory stand to live with me working full time in my current job and could cut out current costs very easily that would put any stress on us as most we have chosen to take on.\n\nI would say there's no financial stress on either of us because we don't live frivolously - writing this comment had me check our budget and since January 2023 we have only spent $376.40 total on activities, buying non necessary items, eating out, having fun, etc. I don't want to call us boring but we have been best friends our whole lives known to each other forever and we just do not do much.

My job just cares about work being done and not what's done. When you have down time they would rather see us doing something with that time then sitting at a desk with nothing to do even if it comes to watching television because being honest we are usually just consuming content back from the company. Meanwhile my partner is in charge of his own work and projects as well as the projects and work of those he manages which causes him to need to put in a lot more time and effort around the clock. \n\nOther commenters had me looking at my budget and we pretty much live off of my salary very comfortably and his salary goes towards savings as well as supporting our loved ones.", "You two hit the lottery of jobs that\u2019s for sure.
