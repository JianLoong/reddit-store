I would be in the office theater, playing various sports or hanging out. Since we work in broadcast media, everyone has a TV on their desk in office, and we would watch shows or sports while working. I make 128k annually, and I get travel perks, free streaming subscriptions, and great benefits. My primary responsibility is representing five clients on seven networks, scheduling their ads, and passing information to clients about these schedules as needed. Right before every quarter change, I have a busy week or two where the clients send me specifications, I book out the next quarter, and share all the data with them. The rest of the time, I wait for email requests for various files or issues and pull and respond as needed. I don\u2019t have any meetings or calls for my job, making my schedule flexible as long as things are done promptly. I\u2019ve taken on internal volunteer roles with various employee groups to fill my time during the days.\n\nMy husband works hard and makes A LOT more money than I do, and he\u2019s in the financial sector, so it\u2019s stressful year-round. I\u2019ll have maybe a week or two of my busy season four to six times a year. I work 50-60 hours per week compared to regular 10-25, and his busy weeks are 90+ hours compared to the standard 50-55 hours. I never complain about how busy he is and try to leave him alone, but in our home office, I\u2019ll always have my headphones on and a TV show while I work or clean the apartment/cook while I work. He sits working on and off meetings seeing me do this, and he\u2019s made comments, but the past week he blew up as I was booking our vacation for this year during my \u201cwork hours.\u201d We do the same vacation every year; I always offer to change, and I am always paying. Still, he says no; he loves what we do and wants to \u201ckeep the tradition\u201d versus trying a different destination, cruise, or another offering from my company. I was excited because I was booking us what would cost most people 11k for a two-week trip for around 3k. Also, because it\u2019s during his birthday week, I booked a tour he has wanted to do for years. I thought he would be excited, but he was so angry he stood up from his desk. He yelled at me, saying I don\u2019t respect myself by having an easy job that allows me to do anything but work and that I\u2019m a simple person mentally and a blowhard asshole for not wanting to be challenged or try a real job. He has gotten angry about a few other things I cannot control recently, and left for his parents for the weekend. I\u2019ve been with this company since I got my graduate degree, and I have taken two promotions in the same line of work while also changing clients and networks a few times, so it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t aspire for more.\n\nEdit - spelling", "created_utc": 1679180678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11v3uba/aita_for_keeping_an_easy_job/", "score": 397, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean, who abandons their wife like that?  Did he actually go to his parents?  Sometimes when a man is straying, physically or emotionally they will try and distance themselves (by leaving) or picking fights over stupid things.  Their guilt is so intense that they feel justified if they can make you the \"bad guy\", or make you lose your temper, then they can say you started it.

You say your job is easy but belive me, if anyone could do it, they wouldn't be paying you 128k per year. They would have interns do it for a pittance. It may seem easy to you because of your skills but if you sell yourself short, people will treat you like your husband does. You should talk to your husband openly about what's really bothering him and maybe consider couple's therapy. But many men are threatened by women who are more successful than they are, and if he's one of them then his behaviour won't improve, I'm afraid.", "NTA. Keep the job that truly makes you happy.

He seems jealous that you can do all the things while he needs to work and proof himself day for day. But that is not a you-problem.

I don't want to dox myself with too much information or out my clients but like when I started I represented 35 clients ads on 3 networks and it was only about $800k in accounts managed per quarter on very low demand clients and now I'm managing five massive clients on seven major networks which is around $2.5 million in accounts I'm managing per quarter so I am compensated based on sometimes these clients run into needing data and changes at weird hours or non traditional times and I try to be mostly available for their needs 24/7.

He got to his father's home around 7pm on Thursday and has only texted me good morning and goodnight since, but today he went to my parents as they live by his father to help move some outdoor furniture and deal with a car problem. I really don't see how he could be cheating as we spend almost all of our time together and it's made it harder for him not being here because this isn't like him or us. He got upset a few weeks ago but he yelled this week and I had never heard him yell or go red in the face like this before. I really appreciate the insight and I'm hoping through these comments. I'll be more prepared for a discussion. I really appreciate everyone's concern for him cheating but I truly am not even worried about that as the thought had never even crossed my mind and he has been loyal to me all of our lives.

We do not have rent or a mortgage in the city to worry about and I do own a car so our costs of living are parking, water, electric, gas, trash, public transport, and groceries which we could maintain on my salary alone. He makes roughly 3.5x my salary and uses it to help pay his mother and my parents mortgage (they didn't ask what we offered after renting for years and no longer having that cost), both his brother and my sister's tuition costs (they both graduate in May this year and had a ton of scholarships and that cost will disappear for my sister while we have already offered to pay for his brother to continue into medical school) and investing into savings accounts for our retirement and our future children.

He could change his work situation if he really wanted to\u2026 also, I bet you do most of not all of the household chores (cooking, cleaning, caring for pets if you have any) due to the flexibility that you have during the day. I bet he would be annoyed if you were working as much as he is and that stuff never got done. I don\u2019t think your job sounds easy, btw. It takes top tier people skills to do what you do. I\u2019m sure you have to be pleasant and accommodating at all times when interacting with your clients. Many people with generally even temperaments find this difficult at times, and it would be doubly or triply so if your husband tried to do your job (seeing as he sounds like a hothead). Don\u2019t let him sell you short, and don\u2019t accept this ungraciousness he is showing you.", "NTA. You have nothing to explain. You are doing it and doing it well. I hope he gets some time off and a therapist.", "NTA, but I\u2019m concerned your husband is depressed and/or burned out. He probably needs a decent break and to figure out how to manage his stress levels. I have a job that can be very stressful with a lot of pressure and long hours. It can be very easy to get resentful of people who have it \u201cbetter\u201d than you, even when it\u2019s not warranted. \n\nAre you sure there\u2019s nothing else going on - other areas of your lives he might be unhappy with? New stressors at work? It might be worth checking into some therapy to figure out what\u2019s going on/what\u2019s changed.", "NTA. From what he said when he blew up, I imagine he's been building resentment based on how much healthier your work-life balance is, compared to his. This is silly, of course - he shouldn't *want* someone he loves to feel stressed and struggle the way he does. He chose this line of work, and what's more, your freedom enables you to do things around the house that are no doubt of value to him, too. Plus the vacation!\n\nBut resentment is an already serious mask for a bigger problem and he needs to communicate rationally about what the actual problem is. I'd let him know that what he said to you was Completely Unacceptable, and you deserve an apology... but then ask him whether his stress and the resentment and the long hours is worth the deterioration of your relationship. \n\nRight now, he's subsidizing a *lot* of other people's lives. It's lovely you can do that for the people you love, but it may have him feeling trapped in the demanding job so that he can continue to provide for your families.

It really is ok to step away from the finance sector or look for a less stressful position. I used to be a lawyer in NYC at big firms. There were smaller firms usually known as lifestyle firms. People who started in white shoe firms ended up at lifestyle firms for 1 of 2 reasons. Either they didn\u2019t make partner, had to leave and that\u2019s where they ended up or they decide Weil or Skadden money and prestige wasn\u2019t worth the insane hours, had the student loans pretty well paid off and went to a lifestyle firm. They generally took a pay cut, but their hours improved, they actually got to see their families and have lives and still got interesting, challenging work to do.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for your husband to think about making a similar move? I lived in NYC for years and now I live in Westchester, so I understand that your combined income is not the insane wealth it sounds like to people from some other parts of the country, but you could still have a very pleasant life if he traded a lower salary for fewer hours.", "RIGHT?!", "NTA OP.

He shouldn\u2019t be taking his frustrations out on you, but his feelings matter too.  It sounds like he might be at a breaking point.  You can\u2019t force him to make a change. But he needs to acknowledge where these resentful feelings are coming from and the reasons behind them.  Encourage him to air it all out, and together figure out a solution.
