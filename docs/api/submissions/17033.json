He's a mechanic, and owns a small shop, that he's probably spent more time at than any other location on earth. The man exists to work, and never enjoyed anything else.\n\nHe works on average 65 hours a week, usually 7 days a week. We aren't and never really were hurting for money, so it's not like he was putting in the extra hours to keep us fed. The man didn't care if it was a special day. He's missed most holidays, most of me and my siblings birthdays, and most of him and mom's anniversaries.\n\nTo give you an idea, here's one memory I have of christmas when I was like 14. The shop was closed obviously because it was christmas, and it would be closed the next day as well. Dad insisted that he needed to do inventory instead of the day after, because reasons. So instead of spending christmas with his family, he spent it alone in his shop, logging parts.\n\nHe insisted we get jobs as soon as it was legal for us to do so, and even before that he would drag us down the street to ask the neighbors if they needed us to do anything. My state staggers the max hours for kids by year, so his birthday present for us was reminding us to tell our bosses to give us more hours.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm distant with him. He never showed any affection with us, and never paid attention unless it was to give us work. The man has no friends, no hobbies, no interests besides work and sleep. I don't know why he bothered having three kids, I don't know how mom got him to have sex with her. Well the years caught up to him hard a month ago, he blew his back out and the doctors told him he's screwed.\n\nSo now he's stuck at home, trying to recover enough to work part time. He's driving my mom and younger sister insane, because he's bored as all hell, but literally doesn't know how to entertain himself besides working. So he complains about stuff around the house, tries to fix it, and then makes one of them do it when he can't because of his injury.\n\nSo when I came to visit, I had a talk with him after he said he doesn't know what to do. I basically said \"Look, you did nothing but work for 40 years straight, and you never had fun, what did you expect? This is what happens when you try to work yourself to death, sometimes you don't die in time. Now you're gonna have to stop bothering mom and sis, and find something fun to do, because I don't pity you.\"\n\nHe got pissed at me, so I left soon after.

Nah, he was emotionally absent alltogether. Being physically present but emotionally unavailable is called *proximal abandonment* and it's considered abuse because it really fucks with a kids psyche. \n\nSo, dad emotionally abandoned his kids their entire lives, and now that he's injured and can't continue being absent, he wants them to make him feel better? Nope, asshole move.", "NTA. That was harsh, but it also was the truth. He is now facing the consequences of his past actions. He never build a bond with his family, now they are all alienated from him.", "NTA. I kinda feel for you because my dad is the same. Whenever he wasn't working, he was bothering the rest of us. You did right by telling him to stop venting his frustration and boredom on others and I guess he'll be thinking about what you said for a while. I'd do the same if I were you.", "NTA because what I think you said was justified", "NTA\n\nIf he complains to you again, set his TV to play Eric Claptons \"Cats in the cradles\" and walk out of the room.", "NTA\n\n\nHe is an adult. He made decision that lead to a result.", "NTA and I don't think it is your responsibility to figure out what he can do with himself.  My father had to stop doing surgery because of a back condition and he was and is a workaholic.  He worked a brain injury rehab and then went back to school to become a psychiatrist.  I'm assuming your father still has the shop - he can hire mechanics and run the shop.  Or do something else. \n\n A sudden disability is life changing and it is time for him to see what he has been been missing - family, socializing, recreation.  I recommend reading and socializing while recovering, myself. But he may feel better if he is working on getting back to work, like my dad.  Just earnestly talk about how you feel about him being absent from your lives.  This is a time that he cannot distract himself with work and will maybe re-evaluate how he's been living.", "Soft YTA here. Sounds like work is all he really knows and he's worked to keep you and your family comfortable. \n\nBut maybe I need more info? I went through this with my own dad", "Yta. A bit ESH. \nWhy would you say such mean stuff to your dad. Your dad didn't go out of his way to hurt you. Your statement seems pretty spiteful. \n\nJust some thoughts\n\n1) maybe he started working hard to protect the family and he himself didn't know how to stop working hard. It's not like a switch sometimes. Maybe he was worried he couldn't help raise u well, and that fear motivated him to work hard. \n\n2) just because u think u have enough doesn't mean u actually do or he thinks u do. So it kept him working longer than he wanted until he didn't know how to do anything else. \n\n3) maybe he grew up with a lot of financial insecurity hence his desire to always seek work not just for himself, but you all as well.\n\n4) Did your mom seem unhappy about it? If not, would it be fair to be upset at him over how he similarly treated your mom or sister if they accepted it? \n\nMaybe he never loved you all, but nothing here says he ever hurt u emotionally beyond being unaffectionate. Not being affectionate is not unloving (maybe he's a bit autistic). \n\n\n\n I sometimes hear people complain that they have a partner who isn't successful enough, but then when they switch to a more successful partner they then complain they don't spend enough time with them. What I mean is that even though these two issues are not ALWAYS mutually exclusive, they VERY USUALLY are. You are benefiting from one side of that mutual exclusivity. You can probably scrounge around and find posts from kids who complain that their mom or dad never wants to leave home or stop pestering the children even though there are more urgent things. \n\n\n\nHonestly, maybe your dad loves work and wasn't a good stereotypical dad\n\nOr\n\nMaybe your dad loves your family a lot and just never want you guys to ever have to need or want something and not be able to afford it\n\nOr \n\nHe just sucks at showing affection. \n\nRegardless, in all scenarios, he can still absolutely love you. If I am reading somewhat clearly, your dad wasn't affectionate, but didn't do anything to hurt u in any way.", "EHS - money is *never* a guarantee. Especially when you work for yourself. He worked for a roof over your head, food in your stomach, and education. Your comments towards him were unnecessary and shows ignorance.\n\nHowever, being a workaholic doesn't mean he can't show affection. My dad is a workaholic too, but we never doubted once if he loved us or anything. We would go months without seeing him, but when we did it was magical.\n\nI don't know what you do for work or what your situation is, but I do hope you understand one day you understand his situation more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Being physically around but emotionally unavailable is called *proximal abandonment* and it's considered abuse.", "OP should ask his father what his grand father was like, he may learn about how his father came to value work as a way to show his family his love. I think OP lacks understanding and empathy of the values held by other generations. I'm sad for the father, he did the best he could and now receives hate from his son. OP YTA", "NTA. It is as harsh as it could be, with the years of frusturation. Plus, I love the quote \"This is what happens when you try to work yourself to death, sometimes you don't die in time.\". Some reality check and some reflecting on his life seems to be just what he needs at the moment. It is possible that he will decide to change and build stronger relationships now that he has the time. That is the best case scenario though. The most likely outcome is he will get a new hobby/obsession and you would be back to before. If that does not bother you, you can get him stuff to try out- crosswords for example? Model airplanes?", "NTA he dedicated his life to his hobbies and now he cant do them. If he spent a fraction of that time on his wife or kids then he wouldnt be where he is now but thats on him", "NTA it was harsh but the truth.  \n\nI'm guessing he grew up very poor or something?  But how sad, to lose so much of your life to work.", "I'm on the edge with N A H and E S H. Kids dont necessarily know (and shouldn't know) the financial status of their parents. You were \"never hurting for money\", maybe the exact reason for that was the amount of work he did? My dad worked really hard for years to provide a good life for our family of six, usually left Mon morning to the city and often slept at the office, came back Fri evening to run our farm during weekend. This was the norm until he had a major burnout, fell into depression & alcoholism and became distant. After that his company went bankrupt and we had to cut on a lot of things, I stopped several hobbies/activities that we couldn't afford anymore. Currently he is hospitalised with end-of-life care for cancer, and my anger is directed solely to the unhealthy expectations our society has set for worklife and success since the 80s.", "YTA.\nI get it was emotionally absent and you definitely don't a strong bond with him.\nBut that doesn't mean you don't even try to keep a basic social civility.\nAnd see sometime in business or jobs, if you don't earn as per your efforts. Half hearted efforts don't earn you half, they earn you zero. People who are just 5%less than the winners in Olympic get no medals.\nSo may be he had to work crazy hours to keep earning.", "YTA. Did you ever stop to think that you weren\u2019t hurting for money because of your father working??", "ESH your dad sounds extreme, but he did provide for you and probably loves you in his own way. You lack empathy and kicked him when he's already down.", "ESH. Obviously, your Dad for being absent. But you for kicking your Dad when he is down. Why was he such a workaholic? Did he grow up poor? Did his father treat him worse than he treated you? Is workaholism his way to avoid trauma? Addictions and compulsions usually come from somewhere. It\u2019s valid to be angry that he was a bad parent. But if you truly want him to \u2018see the light\u2019 now, compassion usually works better than judgement.", "NTA. Based on the title I thought I'd have the opposite judgement but he truly made his own bed with this one. Some people have to work awful, gruelling hours and never see their children just to keep food on the table. Those people don't want to be at work every day but they have to be there to provide basic necessities. Choosing to work away from your wife and children on a holiday when your business isn't open and you (presumably) aren't getting paid is a whole different thing. So is forcing your children to work the maximum amount of hours permitted by law each year as a \"gift\". \n\nYour message was harsh but it was delivered with the same emotional involvement he showed your entire family all your life.

Though avoiding Christmas, with an unreasonable excuse, wouldn't fit in with that. \n\nI don't think OP was too harsh at all as what he said is the actual truth. His father sounds like he has serious emotional deficiencies so how he managed to get married in the first place I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe if OP was feeling a bit kind anyway, he could manage to teach his father how to use the internet that would allow him to access the parts of the internet that has the interests he actually has. Though if his father is in denial that this condition is going to be permanent, it may be too early to try that.", "Telling his kids to work more hours is emotionally hurting them. Never being home on holidays even when he couldn\u2019t be open at the shop is neglecting them which is abuse.
