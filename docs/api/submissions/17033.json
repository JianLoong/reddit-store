He's missed most holidays, most of me and my siblings birthdays, and most of him and mom's anniversaries.\n\nTo give you an idea, here's one memory I have of christmas when I was like 14. The shop was closed obviously because it was christmas, and it would be closed the next day as well. Dad insisted that he needed to do inventory instead of the day after, because reasons. So instead of spending christmas with his family, he spent it alone in his shop, logging parts.\n\nHe insisted we get jobs as soon as it was legal for us to do so, and even before that he would drag us down the street to ask the neighbors if they needed us to do anything. My state staggers the max hours for kids by year, so his birthday present for us was reminding us to tell our bosses to give us more hours.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm distant with him. He never showed any affection with us, and never paid attention unless it was to give us work. The man has no friends, no hobbies, no interests besides work and sleep. I don't know why he bothered having three kids, I don't know how mom got him to have sex with her. Well the years caught up to him hard a month ago, he blew his back out and the doctors told him he's screwed.\n\nSo now he's stuck at home, trying to recover enough to work part time. He's driving my mom and younger sister insane, because he's bored as all hell, but literally doesn't know how to entertain himself besides working. So he complains about stuff around the house, tries to fix it, and then makes one of them do it when he can't because of his injury.\n\nSo when I came to visit, I had a talk with him after he said he doesn't know what to do. I basically said \"Look, you did nothing but work for 40 years straight, and you never had fun, what did you expect? This is what happens when you try to work yourself to death, sometimes you don't die in time.

I'm assuming your father still has the shop - he can hire mechanics and run the shop.  Or do something else. \n\n A sudden disability is life changing and it is time for him to see what he has been been missing - family, socializing, recreation.  I recommend reading and socializing while recovering, myself. But he may feel better if he is working on getting back to work, like my dad.  Just earnestly talk about how you feel about him being absent from your lives.  This is a time that he cannot distract himself with work and will maybe re-evaluate how he's been living.", "Soft YTA here.

A bit ESH. \nWhy would you say such mean stuff to your dad. Your dad didn't go out of his way to hurt you. Your statement seems pretty spiteful. \n\nJust some thoughts\n\n1) maybe he started working hard to protect the family and he himself didn't know how to stop working hard. It's not like a switch sometimes. Maybe he was worried he couldn't help raise u well, and that fear motivated him to work hard. \n\n2) just because u think u have enough doesn't mean u actually do or he thinks u do. So it kept him working longer than he wanted until he didn't know how to do anything else. \n\n3) maybe he grew up with a lot of financial insecurity hence his desire to always seek work not just for himself, but you all as well.\n\n4) Did your mom seem unhappy about it? If not, would it be fair to be upset at him over how he similarly treated your mom or sister if they accepted it? \n\nMaybe he never loved you all, but nothing here says he ever hurt u emotionally beyond being unaffectionate. Not being affectionate is not unloving (maybe he's a bit autistic). \n\n\n\n I sometimes hear people complain that they have a partner who isn't successful enough, but then when they switch to a more successful partner they then complain they don't spend enough time with them. What I mean is that even though these two issues are not ALWAYS mutually exclusive, they VERY USUALLY are. You are benefiting from one side of that mutual exclusivity. You can probably scrounge around and find posts from kids who complain that their mom or dad never wants to leave home or stop pestering the children even though there are more urgent things. \n\n\n\nHonestly, maybe your dad loves work and wasn't a good stereotypical dad\n\nOr\n\nMaybe your dad loves your family a lot and just never want you guys to ever have to need or want something and not be able to afford it\n\nOr \n\nHe just sucks at showing affection. \n\nRegardless, in all scenarios, he can still absolutely love you. If I am reading somewhat clearly, your dad wasn't affectionate, but didn't do anything to hurt u in any way.", "EHS - money is *never* a guarantee. Especially when you work for yourself. He worked for a roof over your head, food in your stomach, and education. Your comments towards him were unnecessary and shows ignorance.\n\nHowever, being a workaholic doesn't mean he can't show affection. My dad is a workaholic too, but we never doubted once if he loved us or anything.

This was in the 1950s so women working as they do now wasn\u2019t really a thing yet, plus she stayed home to care for kids. \n\nThen, 6 months after that, 2 of his siblings died in a horrific car accident. I know my dad watched his oldest brother bleed out in the street, as my dad laid paralyzed with two broken legs, a concussion, and broken ribs. \n\nIt made headlines across the region. He was suddenly the oldest. All of his remaining siblings and mom were shipped off to different family to care for because they were in such bad shape. My dad, for example, fell behind a year in school because he was in a coma and full body cast. \n\nAnyway, my dad is emotionally stunted. To say the least. I can see he values being a father and I know he loves me but he worked 24/7, 365 my entire life because that\u2019s what he learned he had to do to support his family. The remnants of being the \u201cman of the house\u201d at only 15/16.\n\nKind of a maslows hierarchy of needs situation. When you\u2019re thrust into that situation it becomes a myopic \u201cwhat do we need to do to survive?\u201d Pure trauma response. \n\nI was SO ANGRY in my early 20s because I felt like I\u2019d been shorted. I couldn\u2019t understand why work was better than being with me. \n\nNow as an adult\u2026 I get it. His life was so traumatic, in a way I can\u2019t imagine. Of course he struggles to show deep emotion! His dad and 2 siblings were ripped away from him when he was at SUCH a tender age. He couldn\u2019t even go to his siblings\u2019 funerals because he was in a freaking coma. (His mom got remarried \u2014 they needed money! \u2014 and stayed married to a terrible domestic abuser because it was better than no food or shelter. So much trauma!)\n\nSo I\u2019ve had to accept that his love shows in a different way than mine would because that\u2019s what he\u2019s capable of. His love was shown by his sacrifice of hobbies, not having a large group of friends, etc. Every day showing up to work and working 12 hours was his way of saying, \u201cI love you and I\u2019m committed to ensuring you have a safe, stable home to grow up in.\u201d I wish we\u2019d had more emotional depth in our relationship but I don\u2019t resent it anymore. \n\nI love him very much and I appreciate that I\u2019ve grown past the anger. He almost died from a stroke recently and I was so glad I\u2019ve been working harder to understand him.\n\nTl;dr: My dad had an inconceivably traumatic childhood. The way he shows me love is very different than many people. Rather than remain angry, I chose to seek understanding and that\u2019s how I came to appreciate that his love was definitely present, just showing in ways I didn\u2019t understand or appreciate before.", "I\u2019m starting to hit that stage of life too, where I can see my parents as complex and complicated people\u2026 but it\u2019s also ok to acknowledge that \u201cwe did our best\u201d wasn\u2019t good enough. People who are obsessed with work to the point where they\u2019d rather go into their closed shop to do inventory on Christmas rather than spend time with the family THEY CHOSE TO HAVE (especially European and American men, the vast majority of whom absolutely did have a choice in the 20th century even if it was somewhat socially taboo) shouldn\u2019t have had a family. Or they should\u2019ve talked to someone about their unhealthy habits.", "This is it. And hopefully most people will see it like this one day. I too was angry at my father for how he was/is. But he had a tougher dad and a tougher life than me. With much less resources than me. This discussion we\u2019re having is a perfect example of the resources we have now. Were our dads asking for advice to endless amounts of people going through similar situations? No they didn\u2019t know any better all they know is to work. They are ignorant to the emotional side of things doesn\u2019t mean they intentionally wanted to \u201cdamage\u201d you.\n\nInstead people should look at the positives that came from a parent like that. You\u2019re probably tough as shit, reason number 1? You had to stand up to a person like that. \n\n\u201cI love my father for telling me to take off the gloves, cause everything he didn\u2019t want was everything I was\u201d Kendrick Lamar on Father Time I suggest people listen to it. Also the classic a boy named SUE by Johnny cash. Those songs will make you see things from a different perspective", "OP setting dad straight is helping mom. Dad suffered a polite but firm reality check, if someone had done this 30 years ago he've been in a much better spot right now.", "do you think this is a medical advice subreddit?", "That's one fundamental aspect of parenting. The other aspect is to be emotionally present. If u tell, just because he kept them fed and housed (which are basic, right, btw) enough, then idk what to say to you.", "That's the absolute bare minimum that's legally required of being a parent, love doesn't really enter into it.  It *can* be provided out of love, but looking at the information as OP presented it it feels more like something his father did out of obligation.", "On Christmas ?!", "Yes, between Christmas and New Year.", "It means that Dad is responsible for himself and he's the only one who can fix himself.\n\n(Cool user name.)", "Sunny quotes always get an upvote", "Yeah. I have feelings every single day of my life.\r Are you saying you don't have feelings?", "Not a relevant question. No expertise needed to know that back pain doesn\u2019t stop after 10 minutes and he\u2019ll live with that consequence forever.", "It's even more reasonable to do this when the shop is closed on holidays.\n\nCould be made into a lovely Christmas tradition for the whole family.", "Read everything again slowly and try to piece together if I was giving medical advice or relationship advice"]}
