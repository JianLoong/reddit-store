He's a mechanic, and owns a small shop, that he's probably spent more time at than any other location on earth. The man exists to work, and never enjoyed anything else.\n\nHe works on average 65 hours a week, usually 7 days a week. We aren't and never really were hurting for money, so it's not like he was putting in the extra hours to keep us fed. The man didn't care if it was a special day. He's missed most holidays, most of me and my siblings birthdays, and most of him and mom's anniversaries.\n\nTo give you an idea, here's one memory I have of christmas when I was like 14. The shop was closed obviously because it was christmas, and it would be closed the next day as well. Dad insisted that he needed to do inventory instead of the day after, because reasons. So instead of spending christmas with his family, he spent it alone in his shop, logging parts.\n\nHe insisted we get jobs as soon as it was legal for us to do so, and even before that he would drag us down the street to ask the neighbors if they needed us to do anything. My state staggers the max hours for kids by year, so his birthday present for us was reminding us to tell our bosses to give us more hours.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm distant with him. He never showed any affection with us, and never paid attention unless it was to give us work. The man has no friends, no hobbies, no interests besides work and sleep. I don't know why he bothered having three kids, I don't know how mom got him to have sex with her. Well the years caught up to him hard a month ago, he blew his back out and the doctors told him he's screwed.\n\nSo now he's stuck at home, trying to recover enough to work part time. He's driving my mom and younger sister insane, because he's bored as all hell, but literally doesn't know how to entertain himself besides working. So he complains about stuff around the house, tries to fix it, and then makes one of them do it when he can't because of his injury.\n\nSo when I came to visit, I had a talk with him after he said he doesn't know what to do. I basically said \"Look, you did nothing but work for 40 years straight, and you never had fun, what did you expect? This is what happens when you try to work yourself to death, sometimes you don't die in time. Now you're gonna have to stop bothering mom and sis, and find something fun to do, because I don't pity you.\"\n\nHe got pissed at me, so I left soon after.

Nah, he was emotionally absent alltogether. Being physically present but emotionally unavailable is called *proximal abandonment* and it's considered abuse because it really fucks with a kids psyche. \n\nSo, dad emotionally abandoned his kids their entire lives, and now that he's injured and can't continue being absent, he wants them to make him feel better? Nope, asshole move.", "NTA. That was harsh, but it also was the truth. He is now facing the consequences of his past actions. He never build a bond with his family, now they are all alienated from him.", "NTA. I kinda feel for you because my dad is the same. Whenever he wasn't working, he was bothering the rest of us. You did right by telling him to stop venting his frustration and boredom on others and I guess he'll be thinking about what you said for a while. I'd do the same if I were you.", "NTA because what I think you said was justified", "NTA\n\nIf he complains to you again, set his TV to play Eric Claptons \"Cats in the cradles\" and walk out of the room.", "NTA\n\n\nHe is an adult. He made decision that lead to a result.", "NTA and I don't think it is your responsibility to figure out what he can do with himself.  My father had to stop doing surgery because of a back condition and he was and is a workaholic.  He worked a brain injury rehab and then went back to school to become a psychiatrist.  I'm assuming your father still has the shop - he can hire mechanics and run the shop.  Or do something else. \n\n A sudden disability is life changing and it is time for him to see what he has been been missing - family, socializing, recreation.  I recommend reading and socializing while recovering, myself. But he may feel better if he is working on getting back to work, like my dad.  Just earnestly talk about how you feel about him being absent from your lives.  This is a time that he cannot distract himself with work and will maybe re-evaluate how he's been living.", "Soft YTA here. Sounds like work is all he really knows and he's worked to keep you and your family comfortable. \n\nBut maybe I need more info? I went through this with my own dad", "Yta. A bit ESH. \nWhy would you say such mean stuff to your dad. Your dad didn't go out of his way to hurt you. Your statement seems pretty spiteful. \n\nJust some thoughts\n\n1) maybe he started working hard to protect the family and he himself didn't know how to stop working hard. It's not like a switch sometimes. Maybe he was worried he couldn't help raise u well, and that fear motivated him to work hard. \n\n2) just because u think u have enough doesn't mean u actually do or he thinks u do. So it kept him working longer than he wanted until he didn't know how to do anything else. \n\n3) maybe he grew up with a lot of financial insecurity hence his desire to always seek work not just for himself, but you all as well.\n\n4) Did your mom seem unhappy about it? If not, would it be fair to be upset at him over how he similarly treated your mom or sister if they accepted it? \n\nMaybe he never loved you all, but nothing here says he ever hurt u emotionally beyond being unaffectionate. Not being affectionate is not unloving (maybe he's a bit autistic). \n\n\n\n I sometimes hear people complain that they have a partner who isn't successful enough, but then when they switch to a more successful partner they then complain they don't spend enough time with them. What I mean is that even though these two issues are not ALWAYS mutually exclusive, they VERY USUALLY are. You are benefiting from one side of that mutual exclusivity. You can probably scrounge around and find posts from kids who complain that their mom or dad never wants to leave home or stop pestering the children even though there are more urgent things. \n\n\n\nHonestly, maybe your dad loves work and wasn't a good stereotypical dad\n\nOr\n\nMaybe your dad loves your family a lot and just never want you guys to ever have to need or want something and not be able to afford it\n\nOr \n\nHe just sucks at showing affection. \n\nRegardless, in all scenarios, he can still absolutely love you. If I am reading somewhat clearly, your dad wasn't affectionate, but didn't do anything to hurt u in any way.", "EHS - money is *never* a guarantee. Especially when you work for yourself. He worked for a roof over your head, food in your stomach, and education. Your comments towards him were unnecessary and shows ignorance.\n\nHowever, being a workaholic doesn't mean he can't show affection. My dad is a workaholic too, but we never doubted once if he loved us or anything. We would go months without seeing him, but when we did it was magical.\n\nI don't know what you do for work or what your situation is, but I do hope you understand one day you understand his situation more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
