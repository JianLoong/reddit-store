If you were my mother, I would genuinely never speak to you again. I've been struggling with mental illness since kindergarten, and pets bring comfort when I'm struggling. There are studies showing that they help. To take his cat away when he was showing no signs of being a danger to it is frankly unforgivable. I'm so glad my mother is nothing like you. You failed your son terribly and I don't think you can come back from that. I would honestly hate you for the rest of my life and only go to your funeral to tell the story of the heartless woman who lied about my cat dying while I was at my lowest. Like, I just cannot fathom being as horrible as you. My parents got me a dog after I came back from the psych ward because even though we had a cat, I missed my childhood dogs. I'm petting that dog right now. She's been there through all my lows and highs. She helps. That cat probably helped, too. Your actions were beyond disgraceful. How could you?", "NAH \u2014 i think lying to someone who is already struggling with their grasp on reality was a really poor choice, but you were doing the best you could in an incredibly difficult situation. im so sorry for your loss and i hope you and your son can work through this", "He\u2019s likely never going to trust you again.

The risk of being found out was too high.\n\nIt may have been tough but you should have had a sensible conversation with your son about the side effects of medication and the risks to the cat.

Why would you lie to your mentally ill son???", "NAH\n\nI can understand that rehoming the cat may be necessary, especially if he comes home after he is hospitalized but before he's back to long-term stability.  \n\nHowever, you should have discussed this with his actual doctors, asking not just whether it was safe (for the cat) to keep it at home as he's working on stabilizing, and how it should be discussed with him.  \n\nLies, as you learned, rarely hold indefinitely, and then you have to deal with the fallout of someone learning both that they were lied to and what the truth was. \n\nYou need to go to his treatment team now, explain the whole situation (your fears for the cat, rehoming it, telling him it died, him learning the truth.)

This situation sounds absurdly difficult for you, but betraying his trust was never going to be a good decision. You could have easily come up with good reasons to rehome the cat, even temporarily.

Dealing with someone that challenged is difficult. You are doing the best you can. He can deal with the deception and it\u2019s reason.", "NTA. You were dealing with the loss of your spouse along with a mentally unstable child. That's a lot. Luna was given to someone who is keeping her safe and loved.

You took one of his \"family members\" from him after dealing with his father's death. Animals are therapeutic for individuals with mental health disorders. Animal therapy helps ground them and helps them sort through what's real and what is a hallucination/delusion. \nYou're breaking point with him rebounded around his suspicion that you took his father away from him and he was concerned you were going to do the same with the cat. You in turn did exactly that. Then lied about it.  \nHim being a person with schizophrenia, their progress in life revolves around deciphering what is true and what isn't. You successfully tricked him into believing something untrue, which is the opposite of what you're supposed to do as a caregiver.  Then he found out you lied.  How do you expect him to move forward?

Here is a happy picture.\" Instead, you confirmed his worries about being lied to. You confirmed his worries about getting rid of Luna.\n\nAlso. Unless you couldn\u00b4t take care of Luna.

It\u2019s really something that should be discussed with their doctor, though, before doing \u2013 environmental changes like that cause stress, and stress is a trigger for schizophrenia. There were a lot of dos/don\u2019ts around my cousin when they were sorting out his meds, and acting out his delusions (e.g. demonstrably lying to them) was obviously a huge no-no.\n\nOverall, my understanding is that it just depends on the person, their delusions, and their behavior \u2013 and in an unknown like someone just diagnosed?

Not even, idk, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care for her, but I found a family who adore her\u201d or something that\u2019s only mildly fudging the truth??? \n\nDid you ask his actual doctors about this, like\u2026 at all? Or just your idiot brother?", "But he was not your son's doctor. It's incredibly unprofessional of him to make suggestions like that for people who are not his patients. YTA.", "He worked in mental health hospitals okay. But he hasn't examined your son. \n\nHe's a stranger to the son's condition and so his opinion on the matter is invalid.", "Retired? Or was forced to retire? It sounds like he was a shitty psychiatrist.", "The cat\u2019s unfortunately been with the new family for roughly 2 years now (or at least several months? It\u2019s hard to gauge the exact timeline), so legally the son has no grounds to get her back unless they offer, and re-homing the cat again might be too much on a now 22 year old cat. \n\nBut hopefully he at least gets to see the cat and hold her", "Maybe as a 16 year old with schizophrenia you aren't going to take it well either way. I think this is a really hard decision and I couldn't imagine losing a husband and then having your son's diagnosis. That shit is hard and unless you are professional dealing with mentally unwell people you do the best you can. Is it always the right decision, probably not but you have to learn from it and grow and seek advice from professionals, not the arseholes from Reddit.", "You forgot option three: the knowledge that you killed your beloved pet.", "Obviously neither but a lie hurts more", "This ^ then they would be able to assess if it\u2019s safe for the cat to return", "Not only that but one of his issues was her getting rid of the cat! \n\nI agree with you, this should have been discussed with his doctors who could have advised about rehoming the cat but also how to talk to him about it while he was in a controlled environment.", "This guy can get help. The cat not so much. I had a few arguments with my partner in front of my cat and he stopped eating (the cat, not my partner). His behaviour changed completely.\n\nPets cannot defend themselves and have no choice when it comes to the environment they live in. It\u2019s not fair to subject them to a stressful atmosphere.", "I think the reaction you describe would be everyone\u2019s reaction. Including the know it all people here who have never had to deal with a mental health issue. \n\nWe all *know* what we *would* do in case this and that happens, but when it actually happens, everything changes.\n\nI\u2019ve had patients that thought they are going to crumble, but dealt with it. I had patients that were initially brave, then got scared. I\u2019m not praising or criticising one or the other. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s sooooo easy to have a self-righteous opinion when whatever happens does not happen to you (I don\u2019t mean you-you, I mean some of the people commenting here)", "Given the son's diagnosis and the cat's age, I can see why she would remove the cat. The OP also mentioned that her brother is a psychiatrist and has worked with mentally ill people. He suggested the removal of the cat for the animal's safety. OP probably could have been honest about where the cat was, but she was not wrong about considering the cat's well-being.", "So she should have waited until he killed the cat because it was 'talking' to him?\n\nShould she have lied- no.  But since he had been newly diagnosed, there would no way of knowing if the son had the potential to be one of the more violent schizophrenics or not.", "And what if the son was in the select group that harms animals?", "Yeah I'm pretty sure any psychiatrist worth their salt at the very least would be hesitant to weigh in on someone who they have never had as a patient if not outright refuse to.\n\nAlso wouldn't refusing to diagnose family be a common thing? I'm not as sure about that one, but I'm very confident about the former.", "It\u2019s not *his* cat. The cat was around before the son was. OP got rid of OPs cat.", "I fear that with all that is happening he might even end up with depression.\n\n\nCan you imagine that your whole family lied to you, took away your only individual that you trust and love , and you're unable to take her back?\n\n\nI sure hope that the cat will be in condition to be back with him. I'm sure that she misses him too.\n\nAnd I damn sure hope that the 'family' who took the cat will give her back if that's the case.", "Funny how everyone goes on about how hard it is for OP. Screw the son, am I right? \n\nSaneism is one hell of a drug.", "I don't think being cruel to an animal would be the way to go and rehoming a cat temporarily would be cruel, especially a 19 years old cat. Even moving with the own family is very stressful for cats. Years ago our kitchen burnt down and I had to take my two cats which where not that old for some weeks with me to my sister. Even my little giant that is commonly pretty stress resistent suffered visibly from that stress and lost a lot of weight. My other cat that was always pretty easily stressed was that traumatised by that he still shows the affects from that and yes, I was to a vet, got meds and all but since then he barely leaves the house (they are both outdoor cats) and his primary place is under the bed. He is actually depressed and suffering from that trauma - and that was for some weeks and together with me.\n\nA temporary rehoming is easier with a dog but even for a dog it would be quite stressful but you don't do that with a 19 years old cat if you can avoid that and that might mean rehoming it completely, especially if it is with people you know and trust. And we are not speaking of a couple of days or just weeks even, we are speaking to put an old cat into that stress for months at least since schizophrenia is not like something easily and fast be dealt with, let it accustom to the new situation and accept it as the new home and then bring it back. No, a temporary rehoming of a cat should be as short as possible.", "Yeah, my uncle had schizophrenia - if you haven\u2019t experienced life with some one like that I think it\u2019s hard to understand that there really is no reasoning that can be done. At best waiting out, redirection, and meds actually working are the best you can hope for.\n\nEdit: I do think the mom should have handled this differently and unfortunately if my uncle is any judge it\u2019s quite possible her son will hold this over her for the rest of their lives together. I would say NTA but bad choices were made.", "Was scrolling for this comment. My brother is bi-polar schizophrenic, and one of his worse episodes he was absolutely *CONVINCED* our mother wasn't our mother. That it was someone else inhabiting her skin. That was trying to have sex with him. She obviously made no such advances, multiple family members told him mom is mom, got her driver's license, etc it didn't matter.", "That's the thing, this isn't a normal rehoming situation. I hate to say this, but we've had numerous stories on here where a mentally unstable family member caused serious harm to pets while having an episode, even if they normally wouldn't. \n\nThis isn't a mark against them, just that sometimes pets aren't safe in these circumstances. I'd rather the cat be rehomed but safe than the alternatives.", "Yep.  Got a couple around and the only thing we can count on is inconsistency and delusions.", "Lying is known to have adverse outcomes though.", "Not really.  As a little kid my parents did the cat ran away thing when the cat had to be put down.  I get why they did it and forgave them.  Ironically, I wound up having to deal with death a lot since we burned through a lot of grandparents, aunts and uncles in a short period after that.  They just should have told me when the cat passed.  Lol", "If my mom lied to me and told me my 19-year-old cat died when it was still alive I don\u2019t think I\u2019d talk to her for the rest of my life. Mourning for animals can be horribly painful. That is a cruel thing to do to someone already dealing with mental illness. YTA. You are dealing with a lot but telling someone their beloved elderly pet died when it didn\u2019t is just one of the cruelest things I\u2019ve ever heard. Is your son that scary? Are you yourself safe?", "Yep! My stbx was aggressive and would yell and throw and break things out of anger. One cat refused to be near him even when things were good, another created coping mechanisms by sucking on blankets, and the other hides under the bed in his safe zone. \n\nCats know when bad shit happens and cope in their own way. \n\nBut op should have talked to his drs about how to approach the subject better than lying and continue to lie. Like having a sit down between them and the therapist and coming clean before getting out of the hospital. Now, she has to deal with the consequences of her lie and hopefully get in touch with his medical team in order to make sure he isn\u2019t going backwards and she can figure out how to mend the broken trust.", "Or a move, elderly pets sometimes die from the stress of a move", "There were alternatives.\n\nLetting him know what was happening and having him being stable around the cat as a therapy goal.\n\nLetting him know what\u2019s happening so his therapist can help him grieve.\n\nLetting him know so he could visit the cat.\n\nLiterally anything that didn\u2019t involve leaning into one of his phobias and lying to him *about his pet dying after his dad did*\n\nAdditionally, what you\u2019re saying is very ableist. \n\nYou\u2019re essentially saying that people who struggle with mental illness shouldn\u2019t have pets, despite numerous evidence showing how much the connection between animals and humans helps MI and coping.", "The only thing the brother should have done was refer the kid to a different psychiatrist that had absolutely no biases.", "You mean the uncle who crossed personal and professional boundaries while his nephew was in a mental hospital?\n\nThat uncle?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t really rely on his opinion, NGL.", "Others meaning\u2026 their own parents?

The cat has been part of his family for his entire life. Just because it\u2019s not ONLY his cat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not his at all.", "It's not really an either or thing.  It is hard on both OP and the son.  People sympathising with OP are not saying screw the son at all (unless they actually say that).", "Yes - I think the crux is she wasn\u2019t wrong to rehome the animal but given she already knew one of the things he was delusional about was \u201cyou want to get rid of our cat\u201d, the absolute last thing to do was get rid of the cat *and then lie to him about it*. At the very least his therapist should have been involved in that decision to help work out how to communicate the decision to him and support him through it, and what reasoning would be safe - and to get a second opinion about whether the guy was in a place to be considered likely to be a danger to the cat in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that all the advice to rehome their pet came from family, aka people who don\u2019t know shit anymore than OP did, and likely much less.

One minute all is okay and the next minute they lash out.  An elderly cat wouldn\u2019t take much to get injured.  Both I know are crazy strong and when having a bad episode you don\u2019t want to be anywhere near them.  The only safe thing for the cat and the person that accepted the cat was to lie.  It\u2019s amazing the delusions that they insist are real until you have to deal with it first hand.", "I\u2019m not sure where OP lives. I am in a 1st world country but I have a waiting time of a few months to see a doctor (using the most expensive private insurance available in this country).", "This too. 19 years is a lot for a cat, he/she is probably on borrowed time. It deserves comfort and affection.\n\nEdit: But a move might be better than stress arguments. We can\u2019t really know\u2026", "Nah, I\u2019m not being ableist - I gave an example from my own private life, neither myself or my partner suffer from anything, but our shouting matches *did* affect the cat.  So that\u2019s not happening anymore, as much as we would like to shout at each other, the cat\u2019s wellbeing comes first.\n\nMy point was that all pets should be offered a calm and safe environment to live in, as they cannot fend for themselves.\n\nPets are not utensils, they are sentient beings, and they should not be used for one\u2019s benefit or therapy.\n\nEdit: typos.", "Okay. And? I think we don't know what it has been like to live with the son. The OP does. The uncle has also seen and heard enough since he is close to the issue. And professional and personal advice are different things. If OP's brother made a suggestion based on personal advice, I can see why she would still consider it. We're not part of it. And what if this is what is best for the cat? A lot of people are thinking about the son more so than what that cat may need. If the idea was to help the cat and cause her less stress, then I can't fault the OP for wanting that for the cat. She could have been more honest about where the cat was, but I don't blame her for considering what might be best for the animal.", "That will not help to decide what with cat at all.", "I feel like it's dubious if he gave a disclaimer or not. I won't say that I fully think he didn't, because I absolutely think it's possible OP just glossed past it.", "Yeah I see what you are saying but if her son loved the cat, lying and saying it died is very cruel to the son. Telling the truth would have been a better option. Grief is very painful. Yea, the cats life may have been at risk and the cat needed a safe space but causing her son that kind of grief by lying to him is absolutely cruel. The son already lost his father which may have compounded the grief further. Grief is also probably especially bad for his already poor mental health. I think the Mom done fucked this one up. She is TA. I feel for her but telling someone their cat died is fucked up.", "So what you\u2019re saying is that you don\u2019t believe in therapy or service animals?\n\nThat you judge people who rely on their pets for unconditional love and soothing?\n\nThat\u2019s a very strange take.\n\nAnimals are absolutely sentient, amazing creatures do be respected and protected.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be around people with mental illness.

My cat is an immense help with that, sometimes he\u2019s the only reason I get out of bed - probably that\u2019s what you meant when you were talking about bonds.\n\nBut I don\u2019t ever subject him to aggressive situations, I\u2019ve seen how traumatised he was after a mere argument and I would never do it again, he deserves better than that.\n\nService animals - they\u2019re not being abused, their owners care for them and love them, they are a family member.\n\nWhat you seem to say is that the pet should be there no matter what the health condition is. So it does not matter person x has bouts of verbal or physical violence, they should be able to keep a pet for their own comfort.\n\nNope.\n\nEdit: You were right about me saying pets should not be used for therapy.

What I meant was that they should not be used as emotional crutches if proper treatment is available and using the pet is harming the pet.", "Wow, that\u2019s a really big stretch from \u201cAnimals aren\u2019t here to fix you\u201d to \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in service animals\u201d\n\nObviously the previous poster doesn\u2019t mean that, and I completely agree that animals aren\u2019t here to please humans and should be able to live in a stable environment.\n\nService and therapy animals are chosen after a lengthy process to make sure they are suited for the job. Not any old dog is cut out to be a service animal, and it would be cruel to force an unsuitable dog into that position purely for a human\u2019s benefit.\n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t read anything at all in the previous comment saying animals shouldn\u2019t be around people with mental illnesses. A person with a mental illness can be stable. A person with untreated schizophrenia is not stable. I have depression and anxiety, but am being treated, so I am stable. Someone with untreated depression might have trouble taking care of a pet, and therefore would not be stable. See?  Not that hard to understand.", "The cat was potentially in danger.
