If you were my mother, I would genuinely never speak to you again. I've been struggling with mental illness since kindergarten, and pets bring comfort when I'm struggling. There are studies showing that they help. To take his cat away when he was showing no signs of being a danger to it is frankly unforgivable. I'm so glad my mother is nothing like you. You failed your son terribly and I don't think you can come back from that. I would honestly hate you for the rest of my life and only go to your funeral to tell the story of the heartless woman who lied about my cat dying while I was at my lowest. Like, I just cannot fathom being as horrible as you. My parents got me a dog after I came back from the psych ward because even though we had a cat, I missed my childhood dogs. I'm petting that dog right now. She's been there through all my lows and highs. She helps. That cat probably helped, too. Your actions were beyond disgraceful. How could you?", "NAH \u2014 i think lying to someone who is already struggling with their grasp on reality was a really poor choice, but you were doing the best you could in an incredibly difficult situation. im so sorry for your loss and i hope you and your son can work through this", "He\u2019s likely never going to trust you again. That puts you on a level with him, as you already lost every bit of trust in him.", "Have your son talk to a therapist  . Maybe you should also .", "Rehoming the cat may or may not have been the right thing to do. But you LIED. From his perspective, you are absolutely 100% UNTRUSTWORTHY.

The risk of being found out was too high.\n\nIt may have been tough but you should have had a sensible conversation with your son about the side effects of medication and the risks to the cat.

Why would you lie to your mentally ill son???", "NAH\n\nI can understand that rehoming the cat may be necessary, especially if he comes home after he is hospitalized but before he's back to long-term stability.  \n\nHowever, you should have discussed this with his actual doctors, asking not just whether it was safe (for the cat) to keep it at home as he's working on stabilizing, and how it should be discussed with him.  \n\nLies, as you learned, rarely hold indefinitely, and then you have to deal with the fallout of someone learning both that they were lied to and what the truth was. \n\nYou need to go to his treatment team now, explain the whole situation (your fears for the cat, rehoming it, telling him it died, him learning the truth.)

This situation sounds absurdly difficult for you, but betraying his trust was never going to be a good decision. You could have easily come up with good reasons to rehome the cat, even temporarily.

Dealing with someone that challenged is difficult. You are doing the best you can. He can deal with the deception and it\u2019s reason.", "NTA. You were dealing with the loss of your spouse along with a mentally unstable child. That's a lot. Luna was given to someone who is keeping her safe and loved.

Sure, rehoming the cat might have been their same advice, but they would have likely given you a gameplan for how to approach it with him-- when one of his delusions was that *you* would get rid of the cat, this was the worst possible move.", "So your son was worried you\u2019d get rid of the cat, and you consulted not-medically-trained family members about the issue and did just that?  Yes, YTA", "Yeah OP, you're a dire human being.\n\nIf I were your son this would be be the end of our relationship and that would be the very best part of it for you.", "Being a mom is hard.

You took one of his \"family members\" from him after dealing with his father's death. Animals are therapeutic for individuals with mental health disorders. Animal therapy helps ground them and helps them sort through what's real and what is a hallucination/delusion. \nYou're breaking point with him rebounded around his suspicion that you took his father away from him and he was concerned you were going to do the same with the cat. You in turn did exactly that. Then lied about it.  \nHim being a person with schizophrenia, their progress in life revolves around deciphering what is true and what isn't. You successfully tricked him into believing something untrue, which is the opposite of what you're supposed to do as a caregiver.  Then he found out you lied.  How do you expect him to move forward?

Here is a happy picture.\" Instead, you confirmed his worries about being lied to. You confirmed his worries about getting rid of Luna.\n\nAlso. Unless you couldn\u00b4t take care of Luna.
