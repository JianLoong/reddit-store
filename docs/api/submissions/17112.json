I took time off of work as I put this on my work calendar as soon as I knew the launch date.\n\nFast forward to earlier this week, I reminded her again that I would essentially disappear this weekend to do what I want to do which is to play the new game all weekend. She then plans a movie night with a bunch of neighbors for tonight, on launch day. I made sure to clean up the house, do the dishes and even did like 4 loads of laundry and re-organized the linen closet in preparation for this weekend. The time for the party rolled around and I took a break from playing, made all the popcorn and set everything up in our home theater for her and then went back to play my game. As guests showed up I welcomed them in and showed them the way to the theater room and continued to play my game. When the movie was over I greeted them again as they left and then I helped clean up the kitchen on another short break. \n\nFast forward to now, my wife is mad at me for playing my game downstairs while she hosted the movie night alone. She said it was weird and stupid that I couldn\u2019t carve out a couple hours for this movie night. It\u2019s just a stupid video game she is saying.

She was being petty and spiteful.\n\n>His wife should be first along with other actual humans\n\nIn that case, none of them should be watching a film as their attention would be removed from the actual humans present.
