I made sure to clean up the house, do the dishes and even did like 4 loads of laundry and re-organized the linen closet in preparation for this weekend.

You said Zelda holds a special place in your heart, and that you talked and planned for years about this game.  I don't know what the rest of your marriage is like, but she might have felt like she was in second place to Link and got fed up.  \n\nI think she could have gone about it better, and you did help her prepare for her party and welcome the guests, so I don't think you were unreasonable, but maybe make sure you're showing interest in her as well.", "You did more than I would have.

Halo is my big game, and every new release my wife knows that I'm going to go into a hyper-fixation on Halo for quite some time. She doesn't object when I go all out and buy the Collector's Edition and the whole nine yards.\n\nBut you didn't \"make plans\" for months. Your \"plan\" was to disappear to immerse yourself in something that is, frankly, going to be there no matter what. Yes, adult life sucks. Yes, we all need an outlet and a hobby and whatever. But you're also in a relationship, and your wife deserves your time and attention as well. Helping to prepare for the weekend doesn't grant an untouchable right to become a ghost, and it *is* weird that you could not spare two hours to be social. Why is she calling it a \"stupid game\"? Because you chose the game over her.\n\nAnother reason that YTA here - at best ESH - is that you didn't do the biggest element to a marriage; ***communicate***. Should she have planned this on the release night? Probably not, but another element of Adult Life is that schedules suck. The weekend is usually the best time for gatherings. She evidently gave you some forewarning to this as you were able to contribute to preparations, did you ask if the movie night could be moved to the next weekend?\n\nAnd in foresight of the downvotes that are already rolling in, this behavior in general is not a good look for us gamers. Secluding ourselves like this (eat, sleep, breathe the game) is very fuckin' weird. There is enjoying a game, there is holding it in a special place, and then there's just being *obsessed* to the detriment of everything else. We all joke and laugh about \"Oh, looks like I know what my life is going to be for the next \\[period of time\\]\", but it *is* weird to then actually put everything on hold to play a game.

We're moving this weekend, so we chose to buy the game next week so we actually manage to pack and move \ud83d\ude02 (I wouldn't be able to resist a new zelda game in the house).

I can be super irritated by adult gamers because of how destructive an addiction to them can be BUT NOT IN THIS CASE. \n\nYou planned this weekend off, you informed your spouse, you helped her prepare for her event that she planned.  This was her gig - not yours. You did well, I hope you enjoyed", "NTA. Based on the planning and warning you were not even obligated to help prepare the house and snacks for the party, and you even went out of your way to greet everyone and say goodbye afterwards. IMO you went above and beyond and am in no way TA. She could have organised it for the weekend after and there would have been no issues.", "Definitely NTA she doesnt support your hobby and wants to walk over what you like, i dont like her", "NTA\n\nYou literally told her in advance, stressing how important it is to you.

NTA, your wife is a massive asshole, link her this comment", "NTA, I like the fact you told her in advance, I love when my partner tells me like when the new fifa comes out I know him and his friends like to catch up, he helps around the house and the weekend is his, you told her she knew it was happening you still helped with things around the house which I think is lovely. \nShe defo did it on purpose", "NTA, it's zelda enough said", "As somebody who\u2019s already sunk 19+ hours into Tears of the Kingdom and had my plans for it botched to hell: NTA.\n\nYou even helped with the mental load for her event \u2014 not your fault she didn\u2019t listen.", "NTA.

Nothing wrong with engaging in a hobby intensely for a few days every blue moon. \n\nYou also told your wife for months. And she chooses this specific weekend for the movie night. Why? What was wrong with choosing another time when life had resumed back to normal? \n\nAs long as the division of labor is fair and there is enough energy regularly put into your relationship (which I\u2019m making the assumption there is, but you can judge whether that is true or not), then the occasional, few-day round-the-clock gaming is absolutely fine.", "Game is legit, and you made your plans known many, many times.

Too bad your wife isn\u2019t that great. If my guy was so excited for a game, I would have cooked or bought his favorite snacks and made sucre he had everything he needed to have a wonderful weekend.

You made them well in advance and kept her updated. If she wants to plan a movie night to have something to do while you play, fine. You are NTA for refusing to join in. Really, before making any kind of couple plans she should be checking in with you, whether you already had plans or not. \n\nI will say I don\u2019t agree that this is a power play. It could be, but it also could just be that she thought you wouldn\u2019t mind taking a break for a few hours to hang out.

I\u2019d lock myself under my bed if my husband did that. I can\u2019t think of anything worse. \n\nAt the end of the day, your wife made a conscious decision to try to override plans that you had made and that shows a lack of respect for you.

Guaranteed if you'd told her months ago you were going on a weekend trip with friends, hunting, fishing, sports event etc this would've been a non issue.\n\n\"but you're home and not doing anything\" has been uttered to me on the past.

You wanted to be right more than you wanted to have peace and space to enjoy a new game. Now every time you play that game she\u2019s gonna make it a point of contention. She\u2019s an ass for doing it but you also fucked yourself on this one acting like you don\u2019t know how some women behave around video games.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, BUT as an avid gamer myself, it\u2019s not what I would\u2019ve done. Especially in this scenario, you still essentially would have an entire three day weekend open to play the game.  You set a boundary for yourself and you held firm to it. That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a little extreme to me and again not what I would have chosen. As much as I love  video games, and I absolutely get the hype and feeling of being so pumped for a new game. I wouldn\u2019t pass up the chance to spend the evening with my partner and friends so I could play a video game that I\u2019d already had more than ample time to play that day, with plenty more time coming over the weekend. \n\nI get why she\u2019s annoyed, but you gave her plenty of warning. I\u2019m sticking with NTA.", "YTA, sorry but secluding yourself away for an entire weekend to play a video game is ridiculous unless your 13. Do you realize how silly that sounds for a grown man? Sometimes you gotta put your big boy pants on and go hang out with the adults, bro. Your wife also sucks for putting you in this position but sometimes you gotta make some sacrifices. This would\u2019ve been a pretty easy one.", "I'm amazed by the number of grown men who think playing video games is a legitimate hobby.", "ESH.", "You two should get a child.\n\nYour wife will have something do, so does you.", "YOU\u2019RE NTA\u2026 you\u2019re wife\u2026 maybe.  If you had said you refused to do anything or say anything to the guests\u2026 I\u2019d STILL say NTA\u2026 because, you made a very clear plan for a very specific desire.  \n\nNow\u2026 all of that said\u2026 this could be a nuanced decision if, say, you play video games in all of your downtime and you are neglecting quality time with spouse or friends to play.  If you\u2019re that guy who ALWAYS has SOME game that is doing SOMETHING special that MUST be played\u2026 like this weekend it was Zelda, but next it\u2019s a league raid, and the following is a tournament, then there\u2019s the obligatory lol crew\u2026 you get what I\u2019m saying\u2026\nIf you\u2019re that guy and you and your wife have agreed to prioritize some personal time or friend time\u2026 and you AGAIN skip out to play (Zelda is just this weekends avoidance game)\u2026 well\u2026 then this NTA ruling quickly spirals to you being a definite ah.\n\nSee what I\u2019m saying here is\u2026 perspective matters", "Man this is one of thr more blatant fake stories I've seen in here recently", "Eh. \n\nESH. My husband has also been talking about this game non stop, pre ordered it and started playing it early Thursday, took the day off to play all day yesterday. Last minute yesterday I invited my dad over for a birthday dinner because he was alone all day, I asked my husband if he could take a break, cook steaks for my dad and I and him and just hang with us for the night. So for about 5 hours my husband took a break and did that. When it was done, he immediately started playing again. \n\nVideo games can be paused, moments with friends and family can\u2019t. I love video games as well, and will plan my days to do nothing but that. You and your wife need to communicate better, you being a grown adult sitting the basement playing video games while there is a party happening, IS weird.", "NTA. Personally I am Impressed with how much you prepared for the party and then participated in between gaming.  You made those plans and then did your best to help her despite her making those plans around your preset long awaited weekend. Good for you", "NTA. Sounds like to me your wife is the asshole for ignoring what you've been telling her for months. You have your own hobby that brings you joy. She needs to respect that. I totally understand where you're coming from. I've taken time off to play a new exciting game as well that holds close to my heart. What did she expect was going to happen? The fact that you even mingled a little is going above and beyond.", "NTA", "NTA at all no matter what here but INFO just because I\u2019m curious - how did she react when you told her your plans for that weekend in advance? Was she salty about it from the beginning cause I just sounds like she doesn\u2019t like you playing games tbh", "Massive NTA you did so much", "NTA.", "Zelda ON!   As I can hardly hold open my eyes, from watching the DH  play till wee hours of the morning (and now I'm at work....) \n\nNTA  she should know better....  as should any other partner of a gamer.\n\nBTW... the switch is all mine tomorrow.... HMD to me!", "NTA. My boyfriend got Zelda yesterday and basically has a free pass to disappear as much as he wants this weekend. We have kids in the house so he won\u2019t completely abandon them but other than that, it\u2019s his Zelda weekend. We always do this if there\u2019s a new game we\u2019re excited about. Before kids we would book a week off work for a big release and just binge a whole week. That\u2019s now not as practical with kids but I do full time mum mode to free up some time for him and he does the same for me if there\u2019s a game I\u2019m super excited about. Neighbours can come over any weekend, Zelda is special!! Hope you\u2019re loving it by the way. We went all out any bought the limited edition switch and everything\u2026. So exciting!", "NTA.\n\nYou gave her more than her fair share of notice. You helped her out with setting up the party and doing household chores. If she thinks your game is stupid what's to stop you thinking her movie night is stupid? She lacks perspective and self awareness", "NTA.\nShe obviously did it deliberately. The question is why? There must be a reason for her doing that and you need to talk to her about it.\nWould she get the time to disappear for days in her gaming cave if she wanted to do that undisturbed?", "Ahh you did host the party? You cleaned before, greeted them in and out, you just didn't stay for the movie itself? What is talking about? NTA", "Lol. NTA because I also blocked off time this weekend for the same. But I wonder what the answer would be if you didn\u2019t ask on Reddit.", "Sadly some people don't see hobbies they don't have as anything but pointless. It's like parents telling kids to stop gaming but all they do instead I'd watch TV, both are staring at a TV all day, one actually can improve dexterity, reaction times and memory but because parents don't see that they think it's just 'a stupid game'.\n\nI wonder if your plans were to have a game of poker with friends, to go play a sport or something she wouldn't see it as stupid, wouldn't be fair but people value different hobbies differently because of their own perception and preferences.\n\nNTA ofcourse, cool you have a theatre though, hope you have a wicked gaming set up as well!", "NTA she knows how much you\u2019ve been looking forward to the game release. It\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t help arrange the party and be a good host. You could have easily disappeared for the evening, instead you helped clean up and greet the guests. As for not being at the movie party, who cares? I\u2019m assuming everyone was quiet during the film so what\u2019s the point of you hanging around. Again NTA, hope your wife gets over it", "NTA. Sounds like she wanted you to do all the hosting and she gets the credit bc she invited everyone over. Also I think maybe she thought you just would've done it and not played your game? Idk. I don't even play Zelda and I knew about the release by the number of friends on my SM saying I'm not available this weekend, Zelda came out (these are late 30's/40 yr olds. Not kids.)", "It's a movie night. You did way more than I would so she can host something. She pulled this on purpose. She can be mad because I'd be way more angry. NTA.", "absolutely NTA. you gave your wide ample warning about the game coming out and it shows that she definitely did not care about it when she planned the movie night. you did more than what i would\u2019ve done beforehand AND when your guests arrived by pausing the game and setting things up and saying hi and she didn\u2019t even appreciate that.", "NTA. You TOLD her several times, and she basically ignored it and still hosted a movie night on the day of the launch, expecting you to drop the plan to be there the whole time.\n\nEven then, you helped out with the chores and preparation. She needs to respect and take your interests seriously.", "As a gamer I know the value of this time and the peace is gives you and for her to say its just a dumb game says alot on what she think it means and doesn't care that you need that peace. \n\nI know my man wouldn't take mu gaming time away (or he would have a pissed off wife) and he gives me that when I need it. Sadly yours doesn't and that's something for you to think about for down the road. I'm nearly 40 and I need my gaming still to unwind and break the stress of working a hard week. She doesn't care about your peace\n\nNta", "NTA. This should really tell you a lot about how much your wife really cares about you and your interests. Basically she doesn't give a fuck what you care about if she decides that she wants something else.", "I think what you said to your wife went in one ear and out the other. you are completely entitled to your gaming weekend and if your wife continues to complain you need to be firm with her. NTA", "NTA, my friend. I requested the weekend off to play as well. My bf decided to invite a friend over for some beers. I hung out with them while I played with my switch. I took a pause to season the wings, and he took care of the smoking part. No one got mad at anyone. I got 2 more days of playing. You helped your wife set up, greet people, and even saw them out. You did way more than I would've done. She needs to respect your plans too.", "NTA.\n\nYou made it clear months in advance you had solo plans this weekend, and reminded her repeatedly.  You the helped her set up for her plans, and did the chores it sounds like you would normally do over the weekend so you had plenty of free time.  \n\nIt feels to me like the partner doesn't like gaming and was trying to guilt trip you out of it.  \n\nIt is perfectly acceptable for anyone in our household to say that they are busy for a day/weekend because X is coming out and they want to read/play/watch that for the entire weekend.", "NTA. She knew your plans and willingly chose to invite people over anyway. What\u2019s weird and stupid is her completely ignoring you, inviting a bunch of neighbors over, and then getting mad when you did exactly what you said you would do. It sounds like it all went fine and wasn\u2019t even a big deal until she made it one. That\u2019s rather manipulative, and it\u2019s pretty ridiculous to say it\u2019s \u201cjust a video game\u201d as if watching a movie is so important. She could have done it any other weekend but intentionally chose a night when she knew you had plans. The real issue is that she doesn\u2019t seem to respect your plans or your right to pursue your own interests or decide what\u2019s most important to you, and regardless of any AITA judgment you should talk about it with her.", "NTA. My husband and I were waiting for God\nof War Ragnarok and Hogwarts legacy together. We had no plans for several weekends. It\u2019s not just a stupid game. If you don\u2019t play it soon you will have the game spoiled for you.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nThe wife was deliberately attempting to sabotage your long planned solo event. \n\nShe played a stupid (mind) game and won the stupid prize.\n\n*You* didnt make her look and feel a fool in front of guests. *She* managed to set herself up for that all on her own.", "NTA. I did the exact same thing when RE4 remake released. Your wife is being unreasonable and really showed what she thinks of your \u201cstupid\u201d hobby. All of this over a movie night; it\u2019s not like this was a wedding or birthday.", "NTA. \n\nMy husband did the same thing. Repeatedly reminded me and our kids that he was playing TotK and that\u2019s it. He even bought a whole new switch so we \u201ccouldn\u2019t touch his game\u201d\n\nThen he was up for almost 41 hours before launch day and didn\u2019t get to play yesterday \ud83e\udd23", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is weird and stupid and clearly cannot understand basic instructions. This was not the behaviour of a loving, supportive wife. She belittled your hobbies. Do you really want to be with a woman like that?", "NTA.\nShe knew. She just didn't care.\nIt was probably a lame movie anyway. And she likely spent her time making fun of you for gaming.\n\nI'm lucky that my girlfriend enjoys my gaming hobby and says that there's worse ways I could be spending my time.", "NTA your wife's horribly inconsiderate and you should gtfo before there's kids involved", "NTA - My husband had the same plans for this weekend. I did all of the chores yesterday, made dinner, fed the dogs. When my husband got home from work, I plopped him down on the couch and put the controller in his hands. I plan on taking care of as much as I can for him this weekend because this game means a lot to him and frankly, he needs to escape for a bit with everything going on in the world.\n\nYou need to sit her down and lay this all out for her. This isn't fair to you.", "NTA\n\nIf I'd pulled this on my husband, he would've done diddly squat to help me. And I would've been ok with that, as he made his weekend expectations known way in advance.\n\nThis is either deliberate, or severely inconsiderate of your wife. It was/is important to you. It doesn't matter if games aren't important to your wife, she should've respected your feelings on the matter.", "NTA. She arranged this knowing you wanted to just play the game this weekend. And you talked about it for months! So she can\u2019t claim she didn\u2019t know.", "NTA, you told her what to expect for that weekend and went above and beyond assisting her. She should not have scheduled something if she expected your help.", "NTA - you did way more to help her movie night then obliged.", "NTA, so much NTA.\n\nYou were not \"just playing a videogame\" you were entertaining your hobby. Had your hobby been \"fishing on a remote lake\" you'd been just as unavailable. You even took breaks to entertain the guests between gaming.\n\nAs an avid gamer myself, I had the same fights with my ex, as she couldn't understand that online multiplayer games don't just pause at her pleasure.

Less than an hour in and already >!the Master Sword gets destroyed and links arm gets corroded, chopped off, and replaced. I'm especially pissed about the sword. With the amount of effort I put into the Master Trials to upgrade it I'm upset that it broke that easily!<", "NTA. My wife knows I\u2019ve been waiting 5 years for this.

Why should you? \n\nThe amount of disrespect is high.", "NTA, she deliberately planned something on the days she knew you already had things planned.", "NTA. If you spent all your free time playing games and avoid normal activities I could see a problem, but this was a special event that was really important to you. You even did your chores in advance. \n\nIt seems to me that since she was abandoned for the weekend, a movie night was a good choice for her. She should have enjoyed it with her friends and let you have your fun. Why did she need you there to watch a movie with friends?", "NTA and not only because you had the weekend planned for ages. She can't really be mad at you when she's the one that invited everyone over ya know? It was her movie night so why be mad at you?", "NTA.  You had plans made for months and she planned over it the same week it was happening.  If the label must be given\u2026 she earned it.", "NTA it was stupid of her to schedule the movie night on the weekend you said you were going to be a hermit, and it is great that you helped her prepare for it, cleaned up, and greeted everyone and all that. you realize she did this on purpose right?", "NTA - spoken as a wife to a gamer. \n\nHonestly, I can appreciate her arranging to do something whilst you are sequestered. Heck arranging a movie night with friends sounds a great idea. You even took time out to greet them and say goodbye (which is a lot more than some gamers would have done).", "NTA. Your behavior seems reasonable. You told her well in advance. You handled your household responsibilities and even helped prep and clean up for her party.", "NTA - if this was a normal weekend thing for you I\u2019d understand her, but it was a special circumstance, you informed her months in advance, reminded her, helped her get ready and clean up, and still made sure to greet everyone. The weird and stupid was her planning a movie night for this weekend when she knew what your plans were. Is this normal for her, trying to invalidate your plans to conform to hers?", "NTA\u2014Not only are you a man of culture, you\u2019re a great communicator for warning your wife repeatedly about the release in advance. This was a planned attack. Enjoy yourself!", "This was a power play and she lost. NTA you already had plans and she knew it.", "The sad part, your wife doesn\u2019t hear you. \n\nYou are NTA!\n\nThat game sold out in numerous stores in hours!! It\u2019s something MANY men (and one woman) in my life have been anticipating and no way would I expect them to do something when they had been planning for this release so long!", "So I had something similar happen. I let everyone knowI would literally be busy waiting in line for my copy of TOTK at the stores that night, and after months of planning and preordering, the roommates tried to make \"unskippable\" plans that night.", "As a gaming dad, I was ready to come in here and say you\u2019re the asshole and how games aren\u2019t everything. I knew it was TotK as soon as I saw the title, and I know people have been batshit for that game.\n\nThat said, NTA. This seems like a deliberate attempt by your wife to pick a fight and complain about your gaming.", "NTA\n\nYou have these plans in place for months. She purposely scheduled an event where you told her you was unavailable. Manipulating you, anybody says that you're in the wrong. Just shows that they would be more than happy to do the same thing to their partner disregard their feelings and their plans as though it's worthless.\n\nWhy couldn't she have scheduled the movie night the weekend after it the weekend after that or the weekend after that or so on then you would have both got what you wanted.", "*NTA*\n\nI was physically shaking my head when I read \u201cshe said it\u2019s a stupid game.\u201d No ma\u2019am.

Just like my 100 sports bras bring me enjoyment. \n\nWhen new campaigns and stuff come up, I am happy to piss off and give him the whole weekend or day or whatever *for him*. To me, what my hubby enjoys is not a matter of WHAT he likes and how *I* feel about it. It\u2019s about having enough respect for him to give him space to enjoy what he enjoys.\n\nYou already did MORE than enough by greeting and saying goodbye to your guests, and by cleaning up. You put more than into this than should\u2019ve been anticipated by your wife, as you had been vocalizing your intent to have a Zelda weekend for literal years.", "NTA.\n\nGame releases are sacred and only major emergencies should interrupt them.\n\nFrankly, your wife is lucky her guests even saw you. I would have said \"well, you're hosting by yourself then\" as soon as she said anything. Yes, I had friends I didn't see for a few days. I understood.", "NTA lol You even helped clean, prep, and greet guests, what could she have possibly expected?\n\nI agree with others that this seems deliberate, almost like a power play, but maybe somehow tied to insecurity?\n\nI'd maybe talk to her about setting expectations and how you were VERY clear for months about this and ask her why she decided to create a problem\n\nDoes she feel left out? Is she upset about not spending enough time with you? Is she feeling insecure because of your excitement for the game that she feels pushed aside? Is she just controlling and wanted to force you to have to stop because she enjoys having that control?\n\nAll this and more, next time on Survivor\n\nBut in all seriousness, this is a conversation", "NTA. I have done this exact and thing.  My partner has planned movie nights/ girl nights also and I said ok I will be playing video games. I will help prep but I will disappear after.  \n\nI helped cook the meal. Made sure everyone was able to eat what I made. Then disappeared for the rest of the night. My partner loved and everyone was happy", "NTA. She thought by arranging this movie night you would be forced to give playing your game. You were honest with what your plans were and even did things around the house and helped her set up for the movie and greeted the guests.", "NTA. Regardless of your Zelda plans, why did she suddenly NEED your presence during HER event, when she scheduled it, knowing full well you can't attend? You helped her out with logistics, then let her have fun with her friends, as she planned. You could have gone sleeping or staring at a wall for all they care. Was the movie no longer good just because you weren't physically there in the room? I assume they still had fun. Your time and your presence are yours to do as you want, not a tool for other people's entertainment. This sounds more like a play to control you.", "Sorry man, but her scheduling a movie night after all that advance notice is either lack of care or deliberate sabotage. You need to find out what she was thinking.\n\nI think you were a saint to meet and greet, let alone helping with food. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You informed her months in advance and reminded her. You assisted with clean up and prep.\n\nSorry to say, this sounded deliberate.", "NTA and she's being, at best unreasonable, at worst purposefully manipulative to make you look and feel bad!", "NTA. If it were my partner who had been waiting years for something like that, and had clearly stated they wanted to spend the whole weekend enjoying that thing, I'd throw a video game playing party FOR HIM. Popcorn, one-handed snacks, favorite drinks. And I'd set aside a book I'd been meaning to read or a big handwork project and plan to sit in the room with him, alone in our favorite things TOGETHER.\n\nWhat your wife did was a power play. Not cool.", "NTA\n\nBut I'd find out why your wife thought this odd power play was necessary.", "NTA enjoy sticking everything together, TOTK is epic", "NTA. I also took off work on Friday to play Zelda. My husband knew and understood. He supported me, unlike your wife. I wouldn't doubt it was intentional, now she has something to be upset about. How would she feel if you intentionally scheduled something for her to do when she already had plans.", "Okay I mean, you're NTA, but I desperately need to know why *reorganising the linen closet* is a thing to do before hosting a movie night. Does your day time guests usually frolic in there?", "100% NTA.  I'm a husband, I'm a parent and I'm also a gamer.  I fell out of love with Nintendo a while back, however I get the excitement and hype for a new LoZ, I even got a Wii on launch day just for Twilight Princess.  I have this same hype and excitement for Starfield and have told my wife and kids that for launch day and the day after I shall be unavailable for anything that a isn't life threatening emergency.  They know the score as it was the same for GTA V and RDR2.\n\nYour wife knew the deal, you had informed her of your plans.  If she wasn't happy she's had months to voice any objections and to be honest movie night with her friends sounds ideal for her stay occupied whilst you were engrossed in your game.  This isn't about a \"dumb video game\", this is a out her having the attitude that a lot of non gamer adults have.  Lack of respect for your chosen hobby as they see it as something that should have been abandoned at childhood.", "NTA. You played host for her guests by cleaning, preparing food and the room, greeted and farewelled guests. You did your part. She knew you wouldn't be available and she still tried to for you to give up your gaming time for movie night.", "NTA. I am a gamer. She had fair warning and was inconsiderate of your hobby and time.", "NTA.\nShouldn\u2019t you be allowed to do what you want? You also helped her a lot with the party preparation and even seem to have made an effort to be social and welcoming. It seems very controlling that she absolutely needs you to participate in the movie watching.", "When I read the title, I assumed this was going to be a Mother\u2019s Day conflict for an actual mother (side note - I do think the game makers were idiots for releasing this weekend given their target audience are elder millennials, many of whom are parents to young ones right now). But this? Your wife is being ridiculous. I see why to her it feels like \u201cjust a couple of hours\u201d but you were very clear about this for months and she should chill out. NTA", "NTA she doesn\u2019t respect your hobby, but this is no different than someone putting aside time for the super bowl or the Oscar\u2019s or whatever they are interested in. While I don\u2019t care for Zelda, you best believe when Project Zomboid comes out with their build 42 patch I\u2019m not leaving my chair unless it\u2019s to pee/poop or get more coffee.", "She should put some respect on Zelda.", "NTA. You gave her six months of a heads up. Besides, TOTK is a great game.", "I'm sorry. NTA\n\nI'm glad she decided to have other people around since you would be busy, but she should have gone out to dinner and a movie offsite.\n\nI can't believe you butlered and cleaned for this and STILL got yelled at.  I hate video games and it drives me nuts when a SO or family plays a lot, but that game is huge and you are an amazing partner.", "NTA!  And honestly, wives like this irritate the absolute f*** out of me!  This is NOT how marriage is supposed to go. You've been pumped about this, damn she had 6 months to prepare!  Because SHE clearly isn't a fan of gaming, she feels you shouldn't be. That's not how it works. \n\nYou need to remind your wife that if the shoe were on the other foot, you wouldn't have pulled a stunt like this because you respect her, her likes, and y'alls marriage. \n\nShe's TA for pulling this crap and she's a double A for being mad at you afterward.\n\nI'm all about my hubby's likes, hobbies, business, etc. He's my everything, and I always want him smiling!!!  Always, because his smile could melt me into a puddle, and that's on love and respect on our marriage.  And he is the same with me.", "It sounds like you did a lot, even though she scheduled movie night on the very weekend you told her you\u2019d be absorbed in Zelda. NTA, but why didn\u2019t you challenge that scheduling?", "NTA. My husband loves video games too, it\u2019s relaxing for him. He\u2019s still a responsible adult and spends a lot of time with me but video games are his way of escaping everyday life and relaxing. We always respect each other\u2019s space when we need time to ourselves. If I wanted to see my friends on a day that a video game launched I would plan something outside the house or reschedule. She could\u2019ve simply explained that your video game launched that night so you wouldn\u2019t be joining. It would\u2019ve been less awkward for her and doubt any guests would care", "NTA. What\u2019s weird and \u201cstupid\u201d is for her to try to force your hand knowing very clearly what your plans were.", "Nta this is unfair behaviour on her part\n She knew your plans and disregarded them.l", "NTA- You told her at least twice  about what you had planned. Movie night wasn\u2019t stopped, and if it was truly important for you to be there, she would have picked a different day.", "She doesn't like you.  She deliberately set this up to cause a problem.  I don't know what it is about grown men who spend a lot of time on, or prioritising video games - but a lot of women find it unattractive.", "Nta. Some people will never understand us gamers.

It's a hobby that is far more time consuming than any other one.  Watching a movie takes 2-3 hours, but beating BOTW is 100+.  Video games have a bad reputation of gamers not contributing to adult responsibilities (typically men) and their partners who have to do extra (typically women).  More so than any other hobby.  However it's the games that get blamed and not the people being shit partners.  While games are specifically designed to keep you playing, it's not hard to prioritize correctly.  \n\nMy partner and I are both game devs and play a lot of games.  Mostly it's being in the same room and playing on our own switches/steam decks.  Sometimes I watch her play some AAA console combat game, because I hate playing those types of games, but I need to do research.  Rarely we actually play together.

I can't just neglect my responsibilities to my spouse, even for a video game like Zelda.  It is both of our responsibilities to come to compromises when our wants and needs are in conflict.

Having a weekend to just game is a great way to relax and have a break from the mundanity of life, specially when it\u2019s a game you\u2019ve been excited about for years. (I had been waiting for Hogwarts Legacy for YEARS, before we even knew a name or anything just a leaked clip of what was supposedly a game set in the HP universe. I understand your excitement). Even \u201cjust a couple of hours\u201d is a long time to give up when you don\u2019t have all day everyday to play. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d be going back to work and your regular schedule after the weekend, so those hours you would\u2019ve given up are definitely valuable gaming time. \n\nI haven\u2019t even gotten very far into BoTW after owning it since later 2017, I\u2019m more inclined to go through it now to get to ToTK. I hope you enjoy the game and it lives up to your hype OP.", "Clearly NTA\n\nYou talked about this for months. She knew your plans. She had ALL THAT TIME to voice anything other than \u201cokay\u201d. \n\nI\u2019d show her this thread.", "ESH.\n\nShe sucks for not respecting what you wanted to do after giving fair warning.\n\nYou suck for blocking out an entire weekend for a videogame. I love me some games - shoot, I have a Zelda tattoo - but to take time off work and \"disappear\" from loved ones for a weekend release is excessive.\n\nYou're a team.\n\n(I'm sure there's plenty of context missing, this is based off of what was given.)", "YTA", "jesus dude, its a single movie and a game you can pause. your wife just wants to spend time with you and some friends.  you posted this on Friday so you still had the entire fucking weekend to enjoy the game.", "Yta.  How old r u ?  Its game for kids .   Let your wife go and marry a man who values spending time with her more than a stupid game", "ESH.  Like what adult actually plans 6 months in advance to play a game all weekend?   And what partner doesn't at least ask the other person before planning a movie night at the house?   \n\nYou both need to work on your communication skills.", "But why? Why not let them play? It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll instantly become addicts. Anything in moderation is fine.", "100% agree, the wife sucks. After all cleaning and preparation he'd done? Honestly, I would divorce over this.", "You\u2019d be surprised. My sister has more laundry than that by herself. I probably have three for just towels because I don\u2019t like to overfill the washer. I probably have that much or more too. I hate washing clothes but my problem is the location of my washer and dryer. My house is built weird and is old so the last owners had to build a separate room onto the house because there wasn\u2019t space for it inside the house when it was built.", "I was in charge of the family's laundry when I was in high school, and the bulk of the work came from my mom, who averaged three outfits in one day: work clothes, after work going out clothes, hobby clothes (like bowling shirts etc), lounge in house clothes. I was never done with laundry because she went through more clothes than my dad, my brother, and myself combined.", "Viewing sex as a treat for men so they do their share of the work in a shared space affects us all, it's a problem for the whol society.\nChildren see how their parents interact and copy them - if mum has all the mental work load and always has to ask dad to do stuff or dad recieves a reward for doing cholres while mum just does tgem, then they'll think this is and should be the norm and will treat their partners like they've learnt at home", "Yes, if there were four people in their house, I would have been less surprised at 4 loads.", "Idk, how do you know him cleaning the linen closet doesn't make her so happy, happy enough to feel horny? When my partner does things around the house it kinda turns me on. Idk. Maybe I'm weird for that.\n\nI think sex as a rewards can be good. It's when it's used as punishment that it becomes an issue.", "Yeah. On here some people's standard are way too low. I agree.", "Laundry is a morally neutral act. Whatever gets you through your day with the least amount of stress is okay. Whether that means sorting or not. \n\nI'm a sorter. It works better for me. Other people need to just get laundry done however. It's really about what works best for your household.", "Yeah but reorganizing a linen closet takes like 10 minutes max.", "30 years.  What is \"sorting\"?", "NTA >!You were tending to a friend that just lost an arm,!< she wanted to watch a stupid movie.", "NTA - She did this as some sort of strange test, but the only failure here is hers.\nYou did good, she was super shitty.", "NTA\n\nThe level of effort you put in to support your wife's unilateral and dismissive (of you) party - and you gave all that help without complaint! - was just impressive. Your wife is not kind or considerate of you, she's passive aggressive, and she's unappreciative.\n\nI hope that this is not her norm because, frankly, you deserve so much better a partner than she was here.", "That\u2019s what I told my husband lol. He\u2019s playing this weekend while I work and I\u2019ll play starting Monday when he works. Everybody wins.", "Stupid movie night. Indeed OP is far better than average. The only thing we prep for major game launches is food and comfort. Fortunately, the wife and I are both avid gamers. NTA", "Exactly: it\u2019s about sharing the joy and excitement and of course I want to do that with my partner. \n\nI too have seen too many couples where one is dismissive of the other\u2019s interests and you are absolutely right that it results in distance and withdrawal to varying degrees. It also has a compounding effect because quite often the other party stops showing an interest in their partner\u2019s stuff as well, not to punish but just because it\u2019s hard to muster the energy and willingness for something that is not reciprocated. \n\nThe other thing that really irritates me about people who treat someone\u2019s interest as silly is that we all have interests someone would call silly. Mature adults understand that there are times when interests will take a back seat to important life matters, but weighting interests against each other is different. In this example I truly fail to see how a movie night is superior to playing a video game.", "Holy shit she had people to watch The Blind Side? The movie that\u2019s like 10 years old!?!? Or is there a new one out. I think watching movies is more useless than engaging in a game but they are both entertainment for people\u2026I wouldn\u2019t take that away from someone say, if they were planning ahead for months.", "My husband and I went to our local target as soon as it opened yesterday. We were chatting with a woman and her teenage daughter who was sooo hyped for the game. My husband was getting it for himself, it was his birthday yesterday too. He has been playing almost non stop, but a few of the times he's stopped have been to let our 10yo play. This afternoon they were both laying on the floor while our 10yo played and my husband gave him pointers. It was adorable!!", "You're right. I do agree that in this situation, she's definitely in the wrong.", "Touche!", "That's a bit unusual, don't you think?", "I'm saving up for a Nintendo Switch so I can get the AC where you can create Bob's Burgers characters. Currently have Pocket Camp on my phone and it's just not the same. And I just turned 50.", "It really is fine! I've experimented with various ways of doing the laundry, and it really does work to chunk it all in and wash it on cold.", "I only separate the towels. I don\u2019t like fabric softener on towels. It builds up and makes them less absorbent. The rest, free for all. Delicates just go into their own small bag, just catch them before tossing the rest in the dryer.", "If you have very hard water or are on your own well, I\u2019d even say it\u2019s preferable! Hot water heaters tend to highly concentrate any minerals that are dissolved in the water; they build up scales inside, just like a teakettle. Cold water doesn\u2019t pass through the heater, so it won\u2019t have as much of that stuff floating around in it.\n\nDepending on the specific minerals, it can stain or damage your clothes. For example, in my area, there\u2019s a lot of iron in the groundwater, which makes well water look yellow and can turn white fabric (and even skin!) slightly yellowish, too. (Thankfully the government water supply goes through a lot more filtering, so those of us on \u201ccity\u201d water don\u2019t see it nearly as much.)", "I do and nothing bad has happened so far.", "It\u2019s kind of giving \u201csee how much I helped\u201d (with what I felt like doing that didn\u2019t particularly lessen the burden on the other person.)  \n\nSee:  my dad, riding mower, 1980-present.", "NTA. I play videogames myself and so does my partner. We play different games but understand what patch day and new expansion releases mean for each other. It's our hobbies, and we support each other.", "You will totally be doing this for your son! My kiddo is 14 and his dad told him to hurry home from the bus and surprised him by throwing some drinks and snacks in a cooler, then heading out to GameStop so they got a good place in line. Kid was stoked, dad was so excited to have his lil buddy back for a few hours rather than the teenager he's been lately. Then Friday morning, as my son was about to leave for school his dad says where you going? I thought you'd want to stay home today! So they got to do breakfast and my kid got to hook his switch up to the big screen, they both had a blast it was so cute.", "Do you need to be rewarded to preform basic household tasks?", "Why did people upvote this comment so much, I thought for sure I\u2019d be downvoted", "It's a tripping hazard in hell", "You guys *have* a linen closet??", "I don\u2019t agree it should be used for rewards.\n\nIf it genuinely makes her horny, all power to them. The way he phrased it and the context made me think it\u2019s more about giving a reward, regardless of authentic desire."]}
