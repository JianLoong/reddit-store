You said Zelda holds a special place in your heart, and that you talked and planned for years about this game.  I don't know what the rest of your marriage is like, but she might have felt like she was in second place to Link and got fed up.  \n\nI think she could have gone about it better, and you did help her prepare for her party and welcome the guests, so I don't think you were unreasonable, but maybe make sure you're showing interest in her as well.", "You did more than I would have.

Your \"plan\" was to disappear to immerse yourself in something that is, frankly, going to be there no matter what. Yes, adult life sucks. Yes, we all need an outlet and a hobby and whatever. But you're also in a relationship, and your wife deserves your time and attention as well. Helping to prepare for the weekend doesn't grant an untouchable right to become a ghost, and it *is* weird that you could not spare two hours to be social. Why is she calling it a \"stupid game\"? Because you chose the game over her.\n\nAnother reason that YTA here - at best ESH - is that you didn't do the biggest element to a marriage; ***communicate***. Should she have planned this on the release night? Probably not, but another element of Adult Life is that schedules suck. The weekend is usually the best time for gatherings. She evidently gave you some forewarning to this as you were able to contribute to preparations, did you ask if the movie night could be moved to the next weekend?\n\nAnd in foresight of the downvotes that are already rolling in, this behavior in general is not a good look for us gamers. Secluding ourselves like this (eat, sleep, breathe the game) is very fuckin' weird. There is enjoying a game, there is holding it in a special place, and then there's just being *obsessed* to the detriment of everything else. We all joke and laugh about \"Oh, looks like I know what my life is going to be for the next \\[period of time\\]\", but it *is* weird to then actually put everything on hold to play a game.

You did give her plenty of time in advance, so NTA", "NTA! I hope it's as good as it looks, I've also looked so much forward to this. We're moving this weekend, so we chose to buy the game next week so we actually manage to pack and move \ud83d\ude02 (I wouldn't be able to resist a new zelda game in the house). My husband and I play together, and it's a great thing to share. Maybe try to include your wife some time?", "NTA... I can be super irritated by adult gamers because of how destructive an addiction to them can be BUT NOT IN THIS CASE. \n\nYou planned this weekend off, you informed your spouse, you helped her prepare for her event that she planned.  This was her gig - not yours. You did well, I hope you enjoyed", "NTA. Based on the planning and warning you were not even obligated to help prepare the house and snacks for the party, and you even went out of your way to greet everyone and say goodbye afterwards. IMO you went above and beyond and am in no way TA. She could have organised it for the weekend after and there would have been no issues.", "Definitely NTA she doesnt support your hobby and wants to walk over what you like, i dont like her", "NTA\n\nYou literally told her in advance, stressing how important it is to you. It\u2019s like anyone else with any other hobby carving out a big chunk of time to participate in it.\n\nMe and my bf did the same thing together all afternoon yesterday :) I\u2019m loving it so far!!", "This is so crazy it almost might be fiction...\n\nBut, as a general point, adults in relationships should have their own hobbies. They should make sure the kids and house are taken care of. They should make sure they let their partner know about any impositions well in advance.\n\nThey should still be respectful of their spouse as tbey do their own things.\n\nYou did *all* of this. NTA", "Nah man, she\u2019s gaslighting you, she did this on purpose. NTA, your wife is a massive asshole, link her this comment", "NTA, I like the fact you told her in advance, I love when my partner tells me like when the new fifa comes out I know him and his friends like to catch up, he helps around the house and the weekend is his, you told her she knew it was happening you still helped with things around the house which I think is lovely. \nShe defo did it on purpose", "NTA, it's zelda enough said", "As somebody who\u2019s already sunk 19+ hours into Tears of the Kingdom and had my plans for it botched to hell: NTA.\n\nYou even helped with the mental load for her event \u2014 not your fault she didn\u2019t listen.", "NTA.  You told her your plans well in advance, so she has no right being mad at you when you did what you said you were going to do.

Planning around gaming is such a pain.\n\nThat is NOT what is happening here. \n\nFrom what i can tell here, this is a very rare instance of round-the-clock playing rather than a habit. Nothing wrong with engaging in a hobby intensely for a few days every blue moon. \n\nYou also told your wife for months. And she chooses this specific weekend for the movie night. Why? What was wrong with choosing another time when life had resumed back to normal? \n\nAs long as the division of labor is fair and there is enough energy regularly put into your relationship (which I\u2019m making the assumption there is, but you can judge whether that is true or not), then the occasional, few-day round-the-clock gaming is absolutely fine.", "Game is legit, and you made your plans known many, many times. I don't get why she planned it specifically for that day other than to... idk, test you? Like... just... why?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You are an amazing husband and went above and beyond. Too bad your wife isn\u2019t that great. If my guy was so excited for a game, I would have cooked or bought his favorite snacks and made sucre he had everything he needed to have a wonderful weekend. I wouldn\u2019t have invited Melissa and Becky to bring their families over to watch Legend of the Guardians: the Owls of Ga\u2019Hoole\u2026", "NTA. My partner has taken the week off from work to play this game. If it matters that much to someone you love, then you let them be happy. You weren't needed for a movie night beyond what you already did, considering you already had plans.", "NTA you did more than my son would have if is soon to be wife planned a party for the launch weekend of Zelda. He wouldn\u2019t have left the gaming room. Your wife is TA for making plans for you when you had plans for months. Lots of people do t get the launch day thing with games. I only do as I grew up with 3 brothers and have my son. For whatever reason these games bring you joy and have for years whether she understands it or not she really should respect it.", "It doesn\u2019t really matter what your plans were. You made them well in advance and kept her updated. If she wants to plan a movie night to have something to do while you play, fine. You are NTA for refusing to join in. Really, before making any kind of couple plans she should be checking in with you, whether you already had plans or not. \n\nI will say I don\u2019t agree that this is a power play. It could be, but it also could just be that she thought you wouldn\u2019t mind taking a break for a few hours to hang out. You\u2019ll have to figure that bit out based on your previous experiences with her. Still poor communication on her part.", "NTA at all. She knew you have that plan for months.\nAnd it's the new Zelda. Enjoy it!", "NTA you planned this for months and told her your plans, she was trying to power trip you, I\u2019ve also been waiting for this Zelda to come out since I first heard of it being planned, and I\u2019m also a woman and love Zelda (Im only a beginner at gaming though so not too brilliant at figuring out how to do all the challenges but get by) my hubby though understands that I like gaming and just leaves me to it, he also does all the housework etc ( but that is because I\u2019m virtually bed bound due to disability) but even so if I told him of my plans he wouldn\u2019t try and power trip me just because he doesn\u2019t like something that I love doing", "NTA but your wife is. It\u2019s something that not only was really important to you but you also let her know well ahead of time that you would be devoting a weekend to it. Also who has neighbours over for a movie night? I\u2019d lock myself under my bed if my husband did that. I can\u2019t think of anything worse. \n\nAt the end of the day, your wife made a conscious decision to try to override plans that you had made and that shows a lack of respect for you. I do wonder if you had said you were going fishing with the boys or some other manly man hobby whether she would have tried to override that too\u2026", "Not necessarily the asshole but if I\u2019m her I\u2019m bummed.", "NTA at all. In fact I\u2019m kind of shocked. If SHE\u2019S throwing the party (on a weekend that she KNEW is important for you - in fact on launch day) then why are you cleaning, cooking, etc for the party?", "NTA\n\nProper communication completed, she's the one that ignored it.\n\nAlso, this is a stupid problem those of us that have hobbies at home have. Guaranteed if you'd told her months ago you were going on a weekend trip with friends, hunting, fishing, sports event etc this would've been a non issue.\n\n\"but you're home and not doing anything\" has been uttered to me on the past. Yeah sure except its my hobby and my downtime and my break from every day life.\n\nShouldn't have to grab the game and go play on the pub for it to be 'acceptable'\n\n/endrant", "Games before dames bro bro", "NTA, Asshole move on the wife.

I've also been playing zelda all day. My husband has been aware of the (well deserved) hype for months. What she did was deliberate. Does she have a problem with videogames in general? Or is she jealous it's taking your attention away from her?", "NTA I can't stand ppl who do this... Like u knew what I had planned this weekend but because u don't like videos games and it wasn't important enough to u it's a waste of time \ud83d\ude24", "She knew this game launch was coming, and she planned a party and expected you to host?

Nta offcourse", "Nta. You communicated your plans 6 months on advance, repeatedly gave her confirmation and updates about the plan.\n\nShe made her own plans without involving you (rightfully so, as she also now as a free weekend to do whatever SHE wants).  \n\nTo put this another way. If you follow her logic, you could be mad at her for not playing Zelda all weekend because she should have taken time from her plans to do your plans. \n\nYou are NTA and she doesn't take your wants and desires very seriously. It's kind of a shame that she can't see you as your own person and not an extention of her.", "NTA Your wife knew about your plans and planned this anyway, she did this to ruin your time playing the game.  You did a lot more than what I would've done to help her prepare for her movie night.", "The only way id consider you TAH is towards yourself.\n\nYou made it very clear over a long time that you would be doing something that night, she never had any problems then she suddenly changed the plans and expected you to roll with it.\n\nYou need to put up boundaries, don't be serving them food or greeting them when you very specifically said you wouldn't be available.\n\nShe could've done movie night any time, she obviously did it on purpose.\n\nNTA, your wife is. She needs to learn to respect your boundaries when something is important, even if she doesn't understand it.", "NTA she did that shit on purpose lol. Good for you for standing your ground", "NTA.  Movie night was a power play and she doesn\u2019t respect your hobby.\n\nUnfortunately, there really was no way to \u2018win\u2019 this scenario.  It is simply her way of showing you some red flags and that\u2019s really unfortunate.", "NTA at all and I'm surprised you two got married when she so deeply misunderstands a core interest of yours.", "NTA my boyfriend and I have an understanding about launch days. Whenever a game launches that one of us is really excited about, that person gets a few days to dedicate to that game, then afterwards it's on a case by case basis. You told her 6+ months ahead of time and she responded by planning something you still had to help with and then belitting your hobby.

(It's the first cold I've caught in over a year, somehow I dodged all the colds coming home from preschool but not the one that kept half my team off sick this week)", "NTA - She knew you had plans and purposely had people over. You still went through motions of greeting, setting things up, making popcorn, etc etc. How much time were you supposed to donate when *you already had plans*??\n\nShe is selfish and owes you an apology. Plain and simple. Maybe you should just up and leave and let her do all these things herself next time, since she doesn't understand the concept of you having an appt (regardless of what that reserved time is for).", "NTA\n\nShe knowingly planned a movie night on the weekend of you game release then expects you to help host when you already told her ypu weren't.\n\nNot only did you clean and set up as well as greet them and set them up with snacks.", "NTA\n\nYeah, this is a power play on your part. And, you still participated in her stupid last minute movie night that was entirely, purposely to mess with your plans.\n\nSorry dude, your wife sucks. Clearly has no respect for you or your interests", "NTA! If anything, you made a compromise by helping out. That being said, your wife is kind of being an EB for pulling what she pulled and then getting upset with you for doing what you planned to do all along.", "NTA. She wanted to have movie night, you wanted to play Zelda. You helped her prepare, she gave you crap. Nor sure how old you are but my husband and I are mid 30s and if we could have, we would have taken the weekend to play this game. Sadly we work in restaurants and it's Mothers Day weekend so that wasn't gonna happen. Your wife needs to chill. I hope you are having fun with the game!", "NTA\n\nThis was a total power play from your wife.\n\nDoes she often target the things you enjoy?", "I have been a video game widow many a time.

She went looking for a fight and surprise surprise is annoyed that OP held his boundaries and didn't just fall into line.", "It was very deliberate. Throwing an actual party at the house on the one night he asked to keep clear was bad enough but guilt tripping him for not participating after railroading him into it was laugh-in-her-face ridiculous.
