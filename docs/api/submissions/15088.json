{"id": 15088, "submission_id": "12qizti", "title": "AITA for not traveling to my home country to get a surgery done?", "selftext": "I (25F) have been living in Australia for the last 4 years. Last month I fractured my hand and had to get surgery. My parents wanted me to take sick leave and come to India to get it fixed. Their reasoning: it'd be very expensive to get it fixed here, and that it would be easier to have someone to take care of me. I understand their concern, but I wanted to be able to fix things where possible. I suggested I'd to talk to the doctors and explore my options before I decide to fly to India. After talking to doctors, I realized that it was cheaper to stay here and get the surgery as my insurance covered most of it.\n\nI didn't want to go to India for various reasons. First, I want to have the chance to try and fix things by myself wherever possible. Second, I had some major changes happening at work and I wanted to be around for that. And lastly, my father has been looking into various marriage proposals for me even though I have made it abundantly clear that I don't want an arranged marriage. I've been planning on telling them about my non-Indian boyfriend and didn't want to be there until I\u2019d done that. Also, I came back from India after a month-long vacation in November, so it\u2019s not like I hadn\u2019t seen them in a long time.\n\nWhen I called up my father to tell him that I want to get the surgery done here, he blew up. He screamed at me for 10 minutes, saying things like \u201c*You have absolutely zero sense in you. You just always assume that you know best*\u201d, \u201c*Just because you got a little bit of money you think you can handle everything yourself. Of course you don\u2019t even care if we're dead or alive*\u201d, \u201c*You\u2019d rather cut all contact with your family because you prefer this independent life*\u201d, \u201c*We don\u2019t have any right to take care of our own family members now. Yeah, sure stay with people there that you call friends because they're above your family to you now*\u201d and ultimately \u201c*Let us know if you even want us in your life anymore*\u201d. And he blocked me after that. This was 4 weeks ago. I got the surgery done haven\u2019t heard from them at all. I called my mother 3 times and she hasn\u2019t picked up. My brother is getting mad at me that I\u2019m not making more of an effort to reach out to them but honestly, I\u2019m furious too now. They had concerns about me getting my surgery done here, and I got solutions to their concerns. They still insisted I come to India which just makes me believe that all they care about is control. They wanted me in India to ease my life, but when I decided to get the surgery done here, they did not hesitate to put additional stress on me. Also it's their anniversary in a couple of days and I might not get a chance to wish them.\n\nI\u2019m working hard to be a strong independent woman, and I want to have the best relationship with my parents. But I am just afraid that having that kind of relationship would come with me having a lot less control over my life. AITA for not giving that up?\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up. I wasn't expecting this post to reach so many people. Thank you so much everyone for your comments, I really appreciate it! I'm going through them and I'll try to reply to all but it might just be a little slow. I saw a lot of comments suggesting that they might marry me off when I go back. I don't think they can force me into a marriage and surely any self respecting guy wouldn't want to marry someone who doesn't want him? I don't know anymore. I just knew that there would be a lot of emotional drama, manipulation and what not when I refuse to look at the potential suitors and I didn't want to be there in such a vulnerable condition dealing with that.", "created_utc": 1681814438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qizti/aita_for_not_traveling_to_my_home_country_to_get/", "score": 1559, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn\u2019t about helping you, it\u2019s about them trying to prove you need them, and that need leading to control. \n\nIt\u2019s a major parental mistake to make a child feel dependent on them, leading to a lot of failures to launch. You already surpassed that and are well into your adult life. \n\nStand your ground and let them know while you WANT them in your life, you do not NEED them in it if they behave like this. Lower your efforts towards contact and it\u2019s likely they will seek you when they accept they don\u2019t have the upper hand anymore.

They wanted to make life easier for you in India but they won't show you the grace of doing the same from a distance. For me, that isn't love.\n\nYou can work on having a good relationship with them over time but don't compromise on your relationship with yourself and the values + aspirations that you hold most dear. No one will be able to do the work for you so you have to keep your long-term vision for yourself in mind. Parents will be happy for you let go of your dreams so long as you fit the societal mold.

You wanting to resolve things yourself and finding your own solutions are things you're supposed to do and learn how to do for yourself because one day, your parents won't be around and trust me that if they can learn that you can take care of yourself this will help them get peace of mind.\n\nPlease think carefully and try to write out your feelings into a bullet point list of your arguments and points of topic of concerns you have and that u think they have and text or call them and keep this list handy and have time set aside for serious adult conversations. They need to stop treating you like a child. \n\nYou need to express your feelings firmly, respectfully where possible, and tell them you want them to support your decisions and to trust you.

If anyone is dividing your family apart its him and his attitude.", "NTA. It sounds like your dad is more mad you aren't being a traditional Indian woman.", "NTA. This isn't about the surgery, as you have correctly surmised. I would be worried if you did go back they'd hide your passport in an attempt to force the marriage. It's ok to want to be independent, sadly it comes at a cost to some relationships. If you're struggling with this maybe see your GP for a psychology referral (or go yourself if insurance covers it). Having a professional to guide you through boundary setting and guilty feelings can be very helpful.", "NTA OP, it\u2019s not easy doing the right thing in this situation because some people are gonna guilt trip or manipulate you into stuff that whey want.

You just visited in November.\n\nIt's ridiculous that he went all nuclear saying you don't care if they are dead or alive.   I can't stand when people go histrionic like that.   You are doing the right thing.", "NTA and surely you don't truly believe you are? I hope you don't.\n\nIn my opinion this is about control and \"face\". \n\nIt's NOT about the cost of the surgery, since if that was the case, it being cheaper in Australia would have shut down the whole \"come to India\" demand immediately.\n\nYour parents are not accepting that your move to Australia means you will no longer behave like a typical subservient daughter. (My family are Indian, though I wasn't born there, I have a strong insight).\n\nThat's their problem to either get over, or not.\n\nI think it's also likely that your parents are losing face because they started the process of matching you for an arranged marriage, and were planning to have you meet prospects when you were home for the surgery. Does this sound plausible?\n\nBut that's on them since you made it very clear you are not going to have an arranged marriage, regardless of how nice they try to insist.", "NTA. You're 25, some people already have kids by that age and have to make decisions for them too. You're perfectly capable of making your own medical decisions.\n\nYour father is melodramatic and this isn't even about your surgery. It's probably about them missing you. If you want, I'd try some conflict resolution techniques by acknowledging that they miss you and that you're not trying to cut them off or avoid them, but that having surgery where you currently are just makes most practical and logistical sense.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My sister's been out there a few times and met them, giving his family the opportunity to really fall in love with her, and when my family had the opportunity to go out and support them in their wedding in India, it helped them feel at ease that their son would be taken care of in America and us to know my sister would be taken care of in India. His mom has said that sending him to America for school was her life's biggest regret, at least until they got to know my sister and realized that she will never let him forget India or forget his family. \n\nPerhaps your family is scared they're losing you.

That you are 25 is immaterial to your parents because you are unmarried, therefore your brother and dad are going to be furious that you would dare make a decision they disagree with.\n\nYou could explain all your reasons to them and they still will likely cut you off for not dropping everything to fly to India.\n\nAnd what pisses me off is that way too many sons are treated like little emperors.", "NTA.

They want a weak, obedient daughter/sister, and you're not.  So they blow up at you.  Block you.  They didn't tell you to return to India for your sake... it was entirely for their own. \n\nUnfortunately, you wanting to be strong and independent is the exact opposite of what they want, and as a result... having a good realtionship with them will be difficult until either you give up and do what they want, or they get over themselves and accept that you want to be independent. I hope you choose the latter....I very much doubt that you being the obedient daughter they want will result in a great relationship with them.  THEY'LL be happy, but you'll be miserable.  Even more so when they pick a husband for you that THEY want... without any consideration for what you want (ie. your non-Indian boyfriend.)\n\nNTA.

You are right. It's 100% about control. They see you as a thing, to be possessed and done with as they choose. Set firm boundaries now.

If that\u2019s what they think, ask them why they even want you there? Because they think it will change you and mold you into their perfect submissive daughter? It\u2019s not going to happen", "\ud83d\ude44", "I was about to say that! Parents like yours hide the passport so you can\u2019t leave. Trust me when I say this happens! \n\nIF for whatever reason you do go back to India, take a trustworthy friend with you and have THEM look after your passport and speaking of, print a copy of your passport and leave it with, again a trustworthy friend.", "My thoughts too", "Lol! Physical therapists are brutal. Awesome and well worth it, but brutal all the same ;)", "I read physical therapist as just therapist and I was really confused as to why it's normal for your therapist to tell at you", "It happens, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that crazy. Especially with how bad the blow up was. Imagine how painful it would be to travel internationally with a fractured hand", "*wouldn't have, or wouldn't've, not wouldn't of.", "Couldn\u2019t from said it better myself. \n\nWhat? I thought we were replacing \u201chave\u201d with random shit.", "It was because the bride left her family for her husbands, and it could be pretty far away, so she was to receive her part of the inheritance in advance to make it easier when her father died, and not to be screwed by the siblings living closer. That is the theory, at least, but in practice, human are fucked up, so\u2026", "I love how everyone jumps at this being a \"Indian cultural thing\". I grew up in the Southern US and they disguise arranged marriages here very well. But, it is literally a much darker and questionable practice here. I am lead to believe ( more knowledgeable peeps can correct) that the families go thru a sort of \"dating book\" of eligible brides or grooms from a list of family friends and such. If the bride and groom are a match, things proceed and they eventually date and maybe get married. \n\nThe Southern US... You get introduced to someone from a church, fraternal group that your dad is a part of, friends of the family, and in some cases second or third cousins. I know more than one bride that was married off at 18 to an older husband that was a church member or family friend. And in older times and still today, the bride is escorted by a male relative that is armed. Shotgun weddings are not just for an unlucky couple that got to frisky. The gun is to shoot the bride is she runs. \n\nSo don't judge just because its in a different culture. We are all F\"ed up in our own way.", "Lived in India most of my life, in a large metropolitan city. Educated family and extended family. I'm an only child but all my cousins (all male) accepted dowry. They didn't ask for it (afaik) but they were certainly very happy to accept it. And I want to clarify that this wasn't a wedding gift to the couple. It was specifically a dowry to my cousins.", "Dad has already accepted a proposal 'on you behalf' and is now in the position of losing face with the other family for jumping the gun when you didn't obey. \n\nDon't go back. Just don't. Your dad is just hundreds of red flags in a trench coat. Nothing about his advice is informed or even superficially actually about you.\n\nYou're a grown ass woman. His screaming toddler tantrum is just the last gasp of a misogynist who can't comprehend a woman displaying any agency of her own. Ignore it and him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I know family is important but his reaction is a massive red flag- coupled with them wanting to marry you off I would not advice returning to India without someone there to make sure they don\u2019t try anything. Def tell them about the boyfriend if they reach out.", "NTA, good for you for wanting to take care of yourself.", "My God what an F-ed up culture.\n\nNTA", "Nta. Your parents did the equivalent of a guy threatening to commit suicide if you broke up.  That was a very manipulative response on your dad's part, as well as insulting.  \n\nYou're an adult and handling your business. If anything,  your dad has no sense if he wants to spend more money  to do something overseas that you can do cheaper locally, with way less hassle. He just wants control, and he's throwing a tantrum because he's losing it.", "NTA. They don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about your getting the best medical treatment, they just want to marry you off. Stay away.", "NTA - But why would you allow someone to SCREAM at you on the phone for 10 minutes?  Hang up next time!  And keep hanging up if they can't respect your decision.  You are an Adult and a new generation.", "NTA. Good for you for putting your foot down. The bizarre version of filial piety that south asian culture expects from us is really fucked up and controlling. Don't let them get you.", "NTA - No need to reply ;)", "NTA for all the reasons others have listed. I don\u2019t know what the ulterior motives of your family were, but using out health system as an excuse to go back to India was a bad one it\u2019s not perfect but travelling to another continent for surgery? Yeah, nah. On a slightly ~practical~ note concerning your hand, make sure you get physiotherapy on your hand after it heals. I chipped the bones in two fingers (which doesn\u2019t sound like much) but I had to relearn how to pick things up!", "You: *needs surgery* \nThem: HOW DARE YOU NOT CARE ABOUT US?!?!", "NTA I accidentally got stuck on \"I'm single visiting my family for the first time in my home country in x years/Its a trap!!\" Tiktok and 100% while you were in surgery you would have \"lost\" your passport and ended up married. That's the only reason that they cut you off. They had one chance to sell you off and lost it.", "OP there are two reasons why they want you there, the main one being control like you said. It is actually very common for Indian/Pakistani families to be very controlling on what their kids do or don't do. At least from my experience. My parents for example, have a \"no closed door\" policy that solely exists for their desire to have control over us. They have repeatedly said that I \"need to grow up\" if I don't support their opinion and that I am a \"fool who doesn't know the world\" because I am young despite being an adult and knowing all the facts myself.\n\nThe second reason is definitely marriage and your refusal to go back is both removing their control and making them look like fools to the person they've 'promised you to'. And you should be extra weary of someone who would willingly marry a person who doesn't like them.  That screams of potential abuse to me.", ">Surely any self respecting guy wouldn't want to marry someone who doesn't want him?\n\nLook at how your dad spoke to you. Do you think his main concern is finding a decent man who wants to love and care for you? Or do you think he would settle for a man that is respected enough in the community and willing to put up with an older, unruly woman who has thoughts of independence he is prepared to squash?\n\n>I don't think they can force me into a marriage.\n\nWhat will you do if they destroy your phone and your passport?\n\nNTA", "NTA- I just read your edit? are you serious.... yes you can me married off if you go back.  Take some deep breathes.... at the moment going NC with your family sounds like a good thing.  They sound manipulative as all hell.", "One fuckin hundred percent", "And not to mention that physical violence when daughters refuse arranged marriages are also not unheard of. With the way the parents responded, specifically with the primary focus being on \u201coh so you think you can make your own decisions now,\u201d it seems incredibly abusive & controlling. I\u2019d be worried about ever going back home, & if you do make sure you are already legally married & have an escape plan in place. Alert friends in Australia to the situation, when you should be returning, to know that you will NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES be extending your trip even if you call to say you are, & do not let go of your passport for a second.", "You're not the only one. It definitely felt like that's what the parents were up to.", "i\u2019ve had a couple videos pop up on this topic on tiktok and they\u2019re young men and from other cultures with similar arranged marriage traditions like pakistan. Adult child goes back to home country on their parents behest, gets arranged married out of the blue. \n\nNot all parents are like this of course, lots more modern parents only set up their kids during the dating stages, but it\u2019s common enough that OP brought up they might be forced into an arranged marriage. Plus women are more likely to be subseptible to honor killings and violence than men when forced into this situation. OP\u2019s parents may just have a control issue or really did plan some marriage things but really it\u2019s more wild they would want their child to take a multiple hour plane ride with a BROKEN hand for surgery than have it done where they live", "Emotional therapists can be brutal too. Truth hurts", "You truly kittens done it.", "That is something I completely agree with. It\u2019s heartbreaking for parents to be so awful to their kids.", "Funny you should say that. This reminds me of a YouTube short about a woman wanting a cat...", "That\u2019s probably the cynic in you. Or perhaps the redditor! I am speaking from experience. My dad has these over the top reactions to almost about everything especially concerning my health so much so that he forgets that I might be sick or in pain.", "In places where the male-to-female ratio is pretty forked up (China, India, etc), you'd think the dowry would be the possibility of grandchildren and the parents of the men would be happy for the chance to see their family continue against the current odds and wouldn't need a payment in addition to that."]}
