Last month I fractured my hand had to get surgery. My parents wanted me to take sick leave and come to India to get it fixed. Their reasoning: it'd be very expensive to get it fixed here, and that it would be easier to have someone to take care of me. I understand their concern, but I wanted to be able to fix things where possible. I suggested I'd to talk to the doctors and explore my options before I decide to fly to India. After talking to doctors, I realized that it was cheaper to stay here and get the surgery as my insurance covered most of it.\n\nI didn't want to go to India for various reasons. First, I want to have the chance to try and fix things by myself wherever possible. Second, I had some major changes happening at work and I wanted to be around for that. And lastly, my father has been looking into various marriage proposals for me even though I have made it abundantly clear that I don't want an arranged marriage. I've been planning on telling them about my non-Indian boyfriend and didn't want to be there until I\u2019d done that. Also, I came back from India after a month-long vacation in November, so it\u2019s not like I hadn\u2019t seen them in a long time.\n\nWhen I called up my father to tell him that I want to get the surgery done here, he blew up. He screamed at me for 10 minutes, saying things like \u201c*You have absolutely zero sense in you. You just always assume that you know best*\u201d, \u201c*Just because you got a little bit of money you think you can handle everything yourself. Of course you don\u2019t even care if we're dead or alive*\u201d, \u201c*You\u2019d rather cut all contact with your family because you prefer this independent life*\u201d, \u201c*We don\u2019t have any right to take care of our own family members now. Yeah, sure stay with people there that you call friends because they're above your family to you now*\u201d and ultimately \u201c*Let us know if you even want us in your life anymore*\u201d. And he blocked me after that. This was 4 weeks ago. I got the surgery done haven\u2019t heard from them at all. I called my mother 3 times and she hasn\u2019t picked up. My brother is getting mad at me that I\u2019m not making more of an effort to reach out to them but honestly, I\u2019m furious too now. They had concerns about me getting my surgery done here, and I got solutions to their concerns. They still insisted I come to India which just makes me believe that all they care about is control. They wanted me in India to ease my life, but when I decided to get the surgery done here, they did not hesitate to put additional stress on me. Also it's their anniversary in a couple of days and I might not get a chance to wish them.\n\nI\u2019m working hard to be a strong independent woman, and I want to have the best relationship with my parents. But I am just afraid that having that kind of relationship would come with me having a lot less control over my life.

Either way, NTA you are an adult and handled your own business like an adult", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely right, this is a control thing and it seems like your parents can\u2019t stand you wanting an independent life. They likely viewed this as a way of getting you back in the country to try and gain control over your life again. Your dad\u2019s reaction is the classic reaction of someone that needs control and is having it taken away from them.\n\nDon\u2019t succumb to the pressure here OP.

I do wonder if your family wanted you to come home for another reason  .... like marriage  ... and possibly had various suitors lined up for you.  Your father would have found it difficult to explain that you had made your own decision to stay for medical treatment and not do as you were told.\n\nTraditional Indian parents and arranging marriages are a tough thing to work around.   \n\nGood luck on the non-indian boyfriend  ....  that will be a tough one for them to accept", "NTA. This is definitely a control thing. They\u2019re not worried for your health or finances, they just wanted you to come home because they said so.", "NTA. But surely you knew that. This isn\u2019t about helping you, it\u2019s about them trying to prove you need them, and that need leading to control. \n\nIt\u2019s a major parental mistake to make a child feel dependent on them, leading to a lot of failures to launch. You already surpassed that and are well into your adult life. \n\nStand your ground and let them know while you WANT them in your life, you do not NEED them in it if they behave like this. Lower your efforts towards contact and it\u2019s likely they will seek you when they accept they don\u2019t have the upper hand anymore. That would be a good time to tell them about the arranged marriage thing.", "I can completely understand how conflicted you are feeling but you have to remember that you are your own person now. Attempts to establish control won't ever stop (especially in the Indian Culture where you are expected to show respect to your elders no matter what). So, you have to make a decision on letting them \"win\"  this time or continue to let them win for the rest of your life.\n\nThey may say they mean well and they do but not well enough to  check in on you when you needed them to. They wanted to make life easier for you in India but they won't show you the grace of doing the same from a distance. For me, that isn't love.\n\nYou can work on having a good relationship with them over time but don't compromise on your relationship with yourself and the values + aspirations that you hold most dear. No one will be able to do the work for you so you have to keep your long-term vision for yourself in mind. Parents will be happy for you let go of your dreams so long as you fit the societal mold.

Right now those thousands of miles between you are a blessing. \n\nYour dad is just pissed because he can't control you since you aren't there and his looking for suitors despite your wishes and just treating you like property to marry off and not really listening to what you want should remain your biggest concerns. \n\nI understand how difficult family can be with these types of things, and I really urge you to keep your boundaries and understand that you aren't doing anything wrong. You wanting to resolve things yourself and finding your own solutions are things you're supposed to do and learn how to do for yourself because one day, your parents won't be around and trust me that if they can learn that you can take care of yourself this will help them get peace of mind.\n\nPlease think carefully and try to write out your feelings into a bullet point list of your arguments and points of topic of concerns you have and that u think they have and text or call them and keep this list handy and have time set aside for serious adult conversations. They need to stop treating you like a child. \n\nYou need to express your feelings firmly, respectfully where possible, and tell them you want them to support your decisions and to trust you. And yes, tell them about your current boyfriend and even if they aren't approving about him, it shouldn't matter because they're thousands of miles away and you are the one seeing him for now and so your approval is way above thiers (as long as you are happy). \n\nYou need to live your life away from your folks, so that you can grow, learn, explore new things, and even make mistakes, that is all a part of life and living.

Your parents weren't as concerned about your hand or getting surgery they only care about their own needs. Look how much your father projected only when you told him it was more affordable to get things done in Australia.\n\n\nSorry but your father is being extremely toxic. If anyone is dividing your family apart its him and his attitude.", "NTA. It sounds like your dad is more mad you aren't being a traditional Indian woman.", "NTA. This isn't about the surgery, as you have correctly surmised. I would be worried if you did go back they'd hide your passport in an attempt to force the marriage. It's ok to want to be independent, sadly it comes at a cost to some relationships. If you're struggling with this maybe see your GP for a psychology referral (or go yourself if insurance covers it). Having a professional to guide you through boundary setting and guilty feelings can be very helpful.", "NTA OP, it\u2019s not easy doing the right thing in this situation because some people are gonna guilt trip or manipulate you into stuff that whey want. Just do what you want because others don\u2019t have the right to dictate your life at the end.", "NTA - your dad is very controlling.   You just visited in November.\n\nIt's ridiculous that he went all nuclear saying you don't care if they are dead or alive.   I can't stand when people go histrionic like that.   You are doing the right thing.", "NTA and surely you don't truly believe you are? I hope you don't.\n\nIn my opinion this is about control and \"face\". \n\nIt's NOT about the cost of the surgery, since if that was the case, it being cheaper in Australia would have shut down the whole \"come to India\" demand immediately.\n\nYour parents are not accepting that your move to Australia means you will no longer behave like a typical subservient daughter. (My family are Indian, though I wasn't born there, I have a strong insight).\n\nThat's their problem to either get over, or not.\n\nI think it's also likely that your parents are losing face because they started the process of matching you for an arranged marriage, and were planning to have you meet prospects when you were home for the surgery. Does this sound plausible?\n\nBut that's on them since you made it very clear you are not going to have an arranged marriage, regardless of how nice they try to insist.", "NTA. You're 25, some people already have kids by that age and have to make decisions for them too. You're perfectly capable of making your own medical decisions.\n\nYour father is melodramatic and this isn't even about your surgery. It's probably about them missing you. If you want, I'd try some conflict resolution techniques by acknowledging that they miss you and that you're not trying to cut them off or avoid them, but that having surgery where you currently are just makes most practical and logistical sense.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry to hear that your family is acting like a bunch of majorly self absorbed jerks. You are right that it was about control as they should be happy that you were able to address the injury without needing to fly to another country.

It does sound like that if you want a good relationship with your parents you would need to let them run your life.", "One Indian daughter to another, ignore him. Our parents are overly protective which turns to controlling a lot of times. You need to set some boundaries. It will be a REAL STRUGGLE.

Let\u2019s talk about how you feel you have let me down!\u201d. I would say this calmly and this would ENRAGE him. Silence for a week or two and then back to normal. I gaslit him enough for him to ask me if I really believed that. I told him, \u201cno! You believe that. Just be there to support me if I ask for help, other than that at least let me try. Have faith in your own upbringing\u201d. This improved our relationship a bit. We are still faaaar from perfect but at least he isn\u2019t underestimating me every step of the way.

Parents can be bullies sometimes. You did the right thing.", "NTA...send them a lovely anniversary gift.", "NTA. Even aside from the obvious red flags about your parents wanting to set up an arranged marriage, that's a loooooong flight to make with a fractured hand. Squeezing around with other people, carrying luggage. \n\nIf you ever do visit them in India again, rent a safety box at the airport and keep your valuables in there. Return ticket, passport, extra money, and an extra cellphone, all that stuff so they can't hold it hostage. Because this sounds sketchy af.", "NTA they wanted to human traffick you and force you to be married and raped by some random guy they chose. You should probably stay away.", "NTA and you saved yourself a lot of heartache ... very much sounds like they had a wedding planned and the anger comes from being embarrassed in front of the guy's family for being unable to control their daughter", "I thought there's news of another covid breakout in India?", "NTA. You and your parents have a very different vision for your life. You must decide if you\u2019re going to live the life you want or the life they want for you. You seem to be doing a great job so far living the life you want. I hope you can continue to do so. Hopefully, your parents will come around and realize that you\u2019re not going to do what they want but that\u2019s ok because they love you.", "NTA. It's his *right* to take care of you? No, this is a control thing. You are on a different continent, and he can't handle that he can't control you anymore. \n\nDo what you need to do to take care of yourself, and let him drop away.", "NTA OP.  Your family sound like you should go at least low contact with them, because they seem like a handful.", "NTA. I've spent time on the r/AsianParentStories subreddit due to my own father's control issues. To me, the whole thing sounds like they want to guilt trip you into going to India in an attempt to control you and possibly marry you off. But, obviously, I'm biased bc of how many stories I've read that sound exactly like yours, with the addition of an arranged marriage.\n\nI think if you stop trying to reach out for a while (including your brother as he's being their \"flying monkey\" right now) they will either contact you themselves to try again to guilt trip or genuinely apologize. I don't know your family or its dynamics but I do think it'll be better for your mental to ignore them for a little bit and focus on yourself and what makes you happy. It won't be easy but if you want your independence, you may well have to fight for it, even an ocean away.", "NTA. Good riddance. Be glad you don't live with them or that county. Block them", "They absolutely wanted you home to marry you off. They're just embarrassed now that they have to tell the \"groom's\" family that you won't be there when they said you would. Stay away. NTA.", "Don't go back anytime soon. I hate to say it but they might not let you leave if you do. Considering your father's reaction he probably already promised you to someone there. NTA\n\nETA: they'll try to guilt you into coming back, like for a family event. Don't go. If your father reacted like that on the phone, imagine how he'll react in person when you refuse to marry the person they chose for you.", "One thing I never understood about our Indian parents is how they firmly believe that we are capable of being married and taking married life responsibilities but not capable enough to take care of our own self. Like there is no logic to it. I somehow can't take care of myself and travel to another country but i sure as hell will be fine going to a different country with a stranger of a husband. \n\nNTA OP. They have shit logic. They just want their kids to be in their control. I know they love us and mean well but most parents seriously lack the basic understanding of letting kids make their own decisions and mistakes and learn from it.", "NTA \n\nDO NOT GO BACK TO INDIA. I have read too many stories of women going home and getting married off. Stay safe.", "NTA\n\nSounds like they wanted you home for it so that they could pressure you into an arranged marriage and then not to leave.  When you didn\u2019t follow their wishes, they got mad.  My guess is they had already promised you to a family they know for a bride and now they are stuck because you are not available.   \nIm so sorry.", "NTA- you do you and take care of you. I\u2019m learning this too for myself.", "This was my guess as well, judging from their reaction they\u2019ve possibly made promises that OP has prevented them from upholding, I\u2019d be wary of any trips home in the near future. \n\nOP NTA.", "More likely is that they have a few prospects lined up and want her to meet them and make a choice. There will be a lot of pressure and emotional manipulation to pick one of the nice young men on offer.\n\nForced marriage doesn't seem typical for a family that sent their daughter to live abroad by herself. They may be very eager to see her married off, but getting her consent is necessary. This is just plain old emotional manipulation.", "[deleted]", "My very first thought.", "My ex husband\u2019s mother kept her dependent on her.

They are controlling and manipulative. Their behaviour is harmful and they do more harm than any of the things they supposedly try to \"protect\" their children against", "Leaving? I highly doubt that would have happened.", "Yeah dads reaction sounded like he was going to get a significant dowry for marrying her off", "Okay this thread is way too out there. Not all Indian families are like that. Indian parents do love their daughters. It\u2019s just they are soo worried all the time that they forget that their daughters are not babies anymore. A lot of disagreements and fights are involved but all Indian parents wouldn\u2019t just marry off the daughter against her wishes.", "Minor correction - a dowry is what the father of the bride pays to the groom.  A bride price is what would be paid to this AH father to get that new car.", "Wouldn\u2019t I know! I have been through this. As an Indian I know family dynamics here are different. I conform to my culture and try to elevate the emotional awareness of my parents. When I see they are unwilling to change, I will cut them off. But  this reddit favourite LC/ NC doesn\u2019t really work here because we are the children of parents, who put aside their needs while raising us, paid for school, undergrad, post grad whatever. They showed affection. They didn\u2019t throw us out at 16 or 18. I also personally see that my parents are deeply flawed and if I can help them be better I will.", "Dowry is given by the bride's family to the groom's family in India. Common mistake though.", "OP is the one who mentioned the marriage proposals her dad has for her. So jumping to the conclusion that something was planned in that direction isn't that far off.", "Atlast a sensible comment in this thread. Some people love to portray Indian culture in negative light. Indian parents are one of the most loving people, please don't make assumption based on what non indian countries tv shows or movies.", "I think it's because of the comment of \"they were looking at arranged marriages for me\" in the post. Because without that, many would just think it's control related, but now there's a possibility of a guy being sprung on her and they may guilt trip her at the very least to keep her in India until marriage if this was the plan", "Doh \ud83d\ude23, you\u2019re right of course!  Too early for Reddit!", "I know it\u2019s a cultural custom but it sounds so icky. \u201cHey, thanks for taking my daughter off my hands, here\u2019s a bunch of money!\u201d", "Literally all Indian dads have marriage proposals for their children. It\u2019s a stupid cultural thing because people in their 50s are too bored here perhaps. My parents know I have a boyfriend yet they have sent me \u201cbiodatas\u201d.

Hopefully it'll help!  :)", "Trust me, it is very icky. It is illegal, but most people find a way around it. Instead of giving money they just give extravagant gifts to the groom and his family. Groom's parents who refuse to take a dowry are seen as amazing people who have hearts of gold.", "I get what you mean and you're right. But in this specific case, OP just mentioned the proposals. Not if her parents are fine with refusing nor if they're pushy. So people will speculate with the sparse info we're given. And considering that most stories that land here are wild (to say it mildly), it was predictable that people would immediately think 'they planned to marry her off!'."]}
