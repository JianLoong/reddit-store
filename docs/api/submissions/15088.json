{"id": 15088, "submission_id": "12qizti", "title": "AITA for not traveling to my home country to get a surgery done?", "selftext": "I (25F) have been living in Australia for the last 4 years. Last month I fractured my hand had to get surgery. My parents wanted me to take sick leave and come to India to get it fixed. Their reasoning: it'd be very expensive to get it fixed here, and that it would be easier to have someone to take care of me. I understand their concern, but I wanted to be able to fix things where possible. I suggested I'd to talk to the doctors and explore my options before I decide to fly to India. After talking to doctors, I realized that it was cheaper to stay here and get the surgery as my insurance covered most of it.\n\nI didn't want to go to India for various reasons. First, I want to have the chance to try and fix things by myself wherever possible. Second, I had some major changes happening at work and I wanted to be around for that. And lastly, my father has been looking into various marriage proposals for me even though I have made it abundantly clear that I don't want an arranged marriage. I've been planning on telling them about my non-Indian boyfriend and didn't want to be there until I\u2019d done that. Also, I came back from India after a month-long vacation in November, so it\u2019s not like I hadn\u2019t seen them in a long time.\n\nWhen I called up my father to tell him that I want to get the surgery done here, he blew up. He screamed at me for 10 minutes, saying things like \u201c*You have absolutely zero sense in you. You just always assume that you know best*\u201d, \u201c*Just because you got a little bit of money you think you can handle everything yourself. Of course you don\u2019t even care if we're dead or alive*\u201d, \u201c*You\u2019d rather cut all contact with your family because you prefer this independent life*\u201d, \u201c*We don\u2019t have any right to take care of our own family members now. Yeah, sure stay with people there that you call friends because they're above your family to you now*\u201d and ultimately \u201c*Let us know if you even want us in your life anymore*\u201d. And he blocked me after that. This was 4 weeks ago. I got the surgery done haven\u2019t heard from them at all. I called my mother 3 times and she hasn\u2019t picked up. My brother is getting mad at me that I\u2019m not making more of an effort to reach out to them but honestly, I\u2019m furious too now. They had concerns about me getting my surgery done here, and I got solutions to their concerns. They still insisted I come to India which just makes me believe that all they care about is control. They wanted me in India to ease my life, but when I decided to get the surgery done here, they did not hesitate to put additional stress on me. Also it's their anniversary in a couple of days and I might not get a chance to wish them.\n\nI\u2019m working hard to be a strong independent woman, and I want to have the best relationship with my parents. But I am just afraid that having that kind of relationship would come with me having a lot less control over my life. AITA for not giving that up?", "created_utc": 1681814438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qizti/aita_for_not_traveling_to_my_home_country_to_get/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Either way, NTA you are an adult and handled your own business like an adult", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely right, this is a control thing and it seems like your parents can\u2019t stand you wanting an independent life. They likely viewed this as a way of getting you back in the country to try and gain control over your life again. Your dad\u2019s reaction is the classic reaction of someone that needs control and is having it taken away from them.\n\nDon\u2019t succumb to the pressure here OP. You should live your life they way you want to, not the way that your parents expect you to.", "NTA .... for all the reasons the other posts have said .....\n\nBut .... I do wonder if your family wanted you to come home for another reason  .... like marriage  ... and possibly had various suitors lined up for you.  Your father would have found it difficult to explain that you had made your own decision to stay for medical treatment and not do as you were told.\n\nTraditional Indian parents and arranging marriages are a tough thing to work around.   \n\nGood luck on the non-indian boyfriend  ....  that will be a tough one for them to accept", "NTA. This is definitely a control thing. They\u2019re not worried for your health or finances, they just wanted you to come home because they said so.", "NTA. But surely you knew that. This isn\u2019t about helping you, it\u2019s about them trying to prove you need them, and that need leading to control. \n\nIt\u2019s a major parental mistake to make a child feel dependent on them, leading to a lot of failures to launch. You already surpassed that and are well into your adult life. \n\nStand your ground and let them know while you WANT them in your life, you do not NEED them in it if they behave like this. Lower your efforts towards contact and it\u2019s likely they will seek you when they accept they don\u2019t have the upper hand anymore. That would be a good time to tell them about the arranged marriage thing.", "I can completely understand how conflicted you are feeling but you have to remember that you are your own person now. Attempts to establish control won't ever stop (especially in the Indian Culture where you are expected to show respect to your elders no matter what). So, you have to make a decision on letting them \"win\"  this time or continue to let them win for the rest of your life.\n\nThey may say they mean well and they do but not well enough to  check in on you when you needed them to. They wanted to make life easier for you in India but they won't show you the grace of doing the same from a distance. For me, that isn't love.\n\nYou can work on having a good relationship with them over time but don't compromise on your relationship with yourself and the values + aspirations that you hold most dear. No one will be able to do the work for you so you have to keep your long-term vision for yourself in mind. Parents will be happy for you let go of your dreams so long as you fit the societal mold. Is that what you want for yourself deep down?", "It\u2019s possible he already made commitments regarding marriage and is now going to have to back off.  Too bad for him.  DON\u2019T GO.", "Please stay strong and keep your boundaries OP. Right now those thousands of miles between you are a blessing. \n\nYour dad is just pissed because he can't control you since you aren't there and his looking for suitors despite your wishes and just treating you like property to marry off and not really listening to what you want should remain your biggest concerns. \n\nI understand how difficult family can be with these types of things, and I really urge you to keep your boundaries and understand that you aren't doing anything wrong. You wanting to resolve things yourself and finding your own solutions are things you're supposed to do and learn how to do for yourself because one day, your parents won't be around and trust me that if they can learn that you can take care of yourself this will help them get peace of mind.\n\nPlease think carefully and try to write out your feelings into a bullet point list of your arguments and points of topic of concerns you have and that u think they have and text or call them and keep this list handy and have time set aside for serious adult conversations. They need to stop treating you like a child. \n\nYou need to express your feelings firmly, respectfully where possible, and tell them you want them to support your decisions and to trust you. And yes, tell them about your current boyfriend and even if they aren't approving about him, it shouldn't matter because they're thousands of miles away and you are the one seeing him for now and so your approval is way above thiers (as long as you are happy). \n\nYou need to live your life away from your folks, so that you can grow, learn, explore new things, and even make mistakes, that is all a part of life and living. Keep doing what you are and have more confidence in your decisions because only you can make yourself happy.\n\nNTA.", "NTA though this title is misleading. Your parents weren't as concerned about your hand or getting surgery they only care about their own needs. Look how much your father projected only when you told him it was more affordable to get things done in Australia.\n\n\nSorry but your father is being extremely toxic. If anyone is dividing your family apart its him and his attitude.", "NTA. It sounds like your dad is more mad you aren't being a traditional Indian woman.", "NTA. This isn't about the surgery, as you have correctly surmised. I would be worried if you did go back they'd hide your passport in an attempt to force the marriage. It's ok to want to be independent, sadly it comes at a cost to some relationships. If you're struggling with this maybe see your GP for a psychology referral (or go yourself if insurance covers it). Having a professional to guide you through boundary setting and guilty feelings can be very helpful.", "NTA OP, it\u2019s not easy doing the right thing in this situation because some people are gonna guilt trip or manipulate you into stuff that whey want. Just do what you want because others don\u2019t have the right to dictate your life at the end.", "NTA - your dad is very controlling.   You just visited in November.\n\nIt's ridiculous that he went all nuclear saying you don't care if they are dead or alive.   I can't stand when people go histrionic like that.   You are doing the right thing.", "NTA and surely you don't truly believe you are? I hope you don't.\n\nIn my opinion this is about control and \"face\". \n\nIt's NOT about the cost of the surgery, since if that was the case, it being cheaper in Australia would have shut down the whole \"come to India\" demand immediately.\n\nYour parents are not accepting that your move to Australia means you will no longer behave like a typical subservient daughter. (My family are Indian, though I wasn't born there, I have a strong insight).\n\nThat's their problem to either get over, or not.\n\nI think it's also likely that your parents are losing face because they started the process of matching you for an arranged marriage, and were planning to have you meet prospects when you were home for the surgery. Does this sound plausible?\n\nBut that's on them since you made it very clear you are not going to have an arranged marriage, regardless of how nice they try to insist.", "NTA. You're 25, some people already have kids by that age and have to make decisions for them too. You're perfectly capable of making your own medical decisions.\n\nYour father is melodramatic and this isn't even about your surgery. It's probably about them missing you. If you want, I'd try some conflict resolution techniques by acknowledging that they miss you and that you're not trying to cut them off or avoid them, but that having surgery where you currently are just makes most practical and logistical sense.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hopefully, it would be short-term and they would come around when they realize you are a happy, capable adult, but whether they will for sure impossible to predict.\n\nThe reality is that you are in an unfair position where you cannot assert your independence without negatively impacting your relationship with your parents.
