How he treated you isn\u2019t OK. I\u2019d be furious if I was left to be awkward with guests like that.", "NTA. I don't care if you have been married for 50 years, if he wanted something specific, he should say so. \n\nAlso, he sounds like he has the maturity of a 14 year old.

NTA, darling.", "Nope first healthy thing you learn in CC at for me was people can't read your mind even those around you for a long time. Say what you mean and mean what you say.

I think his negative reaction has more to do with the fact that he just turned 40 and isn't happy about it than that he was actually disappointed in a party. Just a theory.", "Or OP plastered everything in 40 party stuff and dude sat there going \u2018shit, I\u2019m middle aged, the fun milestone birthdays are over\u2019 existential dread.\n\nTop tip from a Redditor who is not in their 20s but mid forties: when you ask people if they want to celebrate milestone birthdays, ask if they want the number prominent. 30 is often the headwrecker for women. Men struggle more with 40. Lots of people revel in 70 but the in between 40 and 70 is tough. Lots of people think they are cool with \u2018more than half my life has liked passed\u2019 until they see it in front of them on a bloody balloon.\n\nMy dad made a huge thing that he turned 50 the year I was 18 and we both had adult milestones. So I made him a card with the number 50 cut out of magazines and newspapers and collaged because he spent months feeling like 50 was a new phase. On his actual birthday he had a total existential crisis because he realised his dad died at 65 and suddenly seeing and hearing the number felt not a new phase but the sands running through the timer.\n\nIt\u2019s my party and I\u2019ll cry if I want to is a thing for a reason. It\u2019s probably the only time my dad expressed an emotion in a healthy way that the card meant a lot and it wasn\u2019t about me but the bigger picture and I have kept that in mind re \u2018big birthdays\u2019 ever since.\n\nI\u2019m about to turn 45 and it bothers me more than 40. I\u2019ve seen people all biz about 30 and then break down. 35 sends a lot of people weird and in my experience a lot of people who have a birthday while expecting a second kid esp if they only plan two have a bit of a slump or a slight mania.\n\nBirthdays tend to wax and wane emotionally past 30 for a lot of people so always wise to ask each year rather than assume they haven\u2019t changed since last year. What weirds me out is the idea birthdays don\u2019t represent change and are a monolith. \n\nAsk as host, try to communicate as a guest and be aware sometimes you don\u2019t know you will be feeling a certain way until you are. This is a big source of the issue on posts re birthdays and weddings: they are high emotion and you cannot plan your emotions fully. Try talking about it afterwards or reading the room. Don\u2019t assume party for 40 means \u201840 decor party\u2019 (or avoid 40 when they want kudos for it.)\n\nI find this is an evolving thing compared to young birthdays so catches people out. Also I don\u2019t celebrate my birthday because of so much stress around it so I seem to be annoyingly attuned to birthday feels. People regress to childhood on them and often that\u2019s the only day they feel they can. Ask your nearest and dearest what a birthday means to them and generally it solves a lot of issues.\n\nI\u2019d go NAH but with a side eye to him.", "Facts.

I just turned 40 too and don\u2019t like celebrating my birthday and people respect it because I tell them exactly what I want.
