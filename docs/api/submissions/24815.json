He kept to himself and only really interacted with his best friend.  We brought out his cake at the end of the night, and he reluctantly blew out the candles, and then asked me if we could go home.  I told him we could go, but we needed to say goodbye and thank everyone.  He then got annoyed and told me he would get an Uber home, which he did.  I was left to thrnk everyone and say good bye on his behalf.\n\nWhen I got home, I was agitated and asked why he left...he said he NEVER wanted a party, he wanted a new drone and dinner at his favorite restaurant, Outback.  I told him he should have specified this, and let him know that we could easily purchase him a drone and I would take him out the next day to the Outback.  He said his best friends felt forced to celebrate him and give money (I paid for the dinner and said no gifts) and that's not what he wanted.  \n\nHe said I wanted the party and wanted to show off to our friends.I got annoyed and told him to grow up and say what he means, I can't read his mind.

I chose to work to avoid a big deal. My mum told my boss, my boss got a cake and I had to stand there at my bar with about 130 strangers singing happy birthday to me. It was humiliating, it was uncomfortable, it was annoying.\n\nI started reading this and thought your husband was like me and was fully ready to jump to his defense. Then I read on. He agreed to a party. He had a chance to say no and he said yes. He's 40. Pretty sure in most countries that legally makes him an adult.

I'm confused. Have you been married 6 years, or did you marry a 6 year old?", "ESH, but from this post, your husband is more TA - he shouldn't have agreed to a party. However, reading this, it is obvious he didn't really want a party, and wasn't happy during it - you could have picked up on that and asked him what he wants again, or said \"I know this isn't really what you want\" or something.", "NTA. He should be at least half grateful that you did something for him.", "NTA unless you are telepathic.", "NTA.  He told you it was up to  you. He sounds immature and looking for a fight. I would think maybe 40, second kid, etc. is hitting him hard.  I am sorry he was such an AH.", "NTA. Did you make a typo? I think you meant to write that your husband is 4 years old and not 40. But seriously, he\u2019s acting like a whiny toddler. He needs to grow up and appreciate what you did for him. And he can take this as a learning opportunity to speak up and say exactly what he wants next year.", "NTA - You asked him.  Did you ever ask him why he just didn't tell you the truth of what he wanted in the first place?", "Nah youre not the ass and your husband should of told you exactly what he wanted. My wife threw a coupla surprise partys for me and honestly all it did was piss me off. She knows I hate party's so when she tells me I'm getting a gift I need to tell her what to get.

Right now,leaning NTA, but if he asked for a drone, and you ignored that, I reserve the right to change my opinion to E S H (you for ignoring his request for a drone, and him for not being clear that he wanted to go to Outback for his dinner vs a nicer place). My dad also loved Outback, but for his birthday and Father\u2019s Day, I\u2019d always offer something more upscale.

Anyone who knows me knows that surprise parties are the bane of my existence).

Fuck that", "and he wasn't even grateful for what he did get.", "I asked him twice and he said it was fine...I made him a cake with is favorite basketball team logo and made sure his favorite food (steak and mashed potatoes) were served. He said fine, but then acted weird.", "It sounds like it wasn\u2019t obvious he wanted a party, until the party had already started. \n\nWhat was she supposed to do, cancel the dinner and send everyone home? \n\nHer husband is an adult, she asked him what he wanted, how hard would it have been for him to tell her exactly what he wanted the first time she asked?", "So during the party that he was OK being organised for him, ask him again to see if he's OK with it and then what? Sort something else out if he isn't?", "Info: Has he EVER liked parties? Have you seen anyone throw one for him? Does he like attending other people's events? Is he an introvert?\n\nHe definitely shouldn't be treating you like a mind reader or testing you like a teenager, but most people who aren't \"party\" people are generally kinda obvious about it. (Standing in the corner, not really interacting with others, always ready to go home first, etc.)"]}
