IMO, you have two choices, and I do not present these in any preferential order.\n\n1.  If you feel loved and supported by your grandparents, and living with them is a reasonable alternative (i.e. change in location would not affect which school you go to or seeing your friends), approach them about living with them.\n2. Explain in a letter to your mother without calling her names, trying to be respectful, how her words and actions have made you feel your whole life. Do not describe only the negative.  I would suggest, in fact, that in order to avoid instantly putting her on the defensive that you *start with the positive* . . . examples of things she has said or done that make you feel wanted and loved.  If you only highlight the bad and don't acknowledge the good then she has nothing to compare and contrast her behavior to, in order to highlight her shortcomings.  And, if you fail to point out the good, then you are playing into her opinion that you are ungrateful.  As best as possible, focus on her words and actions . . . and be specific.  Do NOT say things like, *\"You were a jerk to me growing up.  You always are an a-hole.\"*  Instead, say things like, *\"when you tell me that I'm selfish because I don't want to babysit, it makes me feel sad that you do not even care enough to know why, I don't want to babysit.  It makes me feel like my importance to you is only as a babysitter, and not as a daughter that you want to spend time with.\"*  At the end of the letter, and only if you want this, tell her that you want a better relationship and would like to go to therapy together.  Having a third-party, unbiased professional to point out to both of you ways to communicate better will do wonders.  Furthermore, a professional can point out your mom's mistakes in a way that does not put her on the defensive . . . and perhaps widens her perspective to see how she has wronged you and needs to change.\n\nYou are only 13, and your mom was very young when she had you, and is a better mother to your siblings primarily because life experience has helped her gain some wisdom, and her life has been easier having the stability and support of an adult partner.

Please remember that.  \n\nAt the same time, however, your mother still has a lot of learning to do as the way she has requested you to babysit and her response at your refusal is not the way a much wiser adult should behave.

She\u2019s not worth your time or energy. The care and affection that you *deserve* from your mom will come from others who you bring into in your life. My in-laws are better parents to me than mine ever were. My mom didn\u2019t even know I got a PhD. My MIL bragged to her neighbours that her \u201cdaughter is a doctor\u201d now. It was so cute haha. \n\nSorry your mom sucks and good luck with your plans to get out - you\u2019ll be so much happier.", "Mom used up all her grace and forgiveness for herself, there was none left over for her innocent baby.", "You can probably go now. Courts often don't force 17 yr olds to follow the custody orders.\n\nMy daughter (17F) had a (physical) fight with her Dad earlier this year. It was the last straw for her so she asked me to come get her. She's been living with me full time since, though the custody order is 50/50. Her dad called the police and said I had kidnapped her. They told him to go pound sand.", "Perfect. NTA. Good luck in the meantime.", "NTA. I'm so sorry OP, you deserve a parent who loves you unconditionally. Please make sure you have your birth certificate, social security card and other legal documents with you as well. I wish you all the love, happiness and health.", "Yay for OP! I was the unwanted child of older parents who thought their family was complete before I came along. As a child I dreamed of having grandparents who were nice to me  (mine were all deceased) to go to when I needed somebody to love me. \n\nI\u2019m so happy for you your grandparents are taking you in!", "I would reconsider that. In many places the police/whomever won't intervene if a 17 year old moves in with their grandparents or another safe person. Courts move slowly so even if your mom did try to force you to move back in with her, you'd very likely turn 18 before the court date.", "Hannibal? Is B.A. here too?"]}
