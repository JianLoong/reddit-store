IMO, you have two choices, and I do not present these in any preferential order.\n\n1.  If you feel loved and supported by your grandparents, and living with them is a reasonable alternative (i.e. change in location would not affect which school you go to or seeing your friends), approach them about living with them.\n2. Explain in a letter to your mother without calling her names, trying to be respectful, how her words and actions have made you feel your whole life. Do not describe only the negative.  I would suggest, in fact, that in order to avoid instantly putting her on the defensive that you *start with the positive* . . . examples of things she has said or done that make you feel wanted and loved.  If you only highlight the bad and don't acknowledge the good then she has nothing to compare and contrast her behavior to, in order to highlight her shortcomings.  And, if you fail to point out the good, then you are playing into her opinion that you are ungrateful.  As best as possible, focus on her words and actions . . . and be specific.  Do NOT say things like, *\"You were a jerk to me growing up.  You always are an a-hole.\"*  Instead, say things like, *\"when you tell me that I'm selfish because I don't want to babysit, it makes me feel sad that you do not even care enough to know why, I don't want to babysit.  It makes me feel like my importance to you is only as a babysitter, and not as a daughter that you want to spend time with.\"*  At the end of the letter, and only if you want this, tell her that you want a better relationship and would like to go to therapy together.  Having a third-party, unbiased professional to point out to both of you ways to communicate better will do wonders.  Furthermore, a professional can point out your mom's mistakes in a way that does not put her on the defensive . . . and perhaps widens her perspective to see how she has wronged you and needs to change.\n\nYou are only 13, and your mom was very young when she had you, and is a better mother to your siblings primarily because life experience has helped her gain some wisdom, and her life has been easier having the stability and support of an adult partner.

Please remember that.  \n\nAt the same time, however, your mother still has a lot of learning to do as the way she has requested you to babysit and her response at your refusal is not the way a much wiser adult should behave.

And even though we fight a lot, and sometimes I can\u2019t even stand her, she would never say such a thing (that she regrets having me and my brother)\n\nOP, again, you\u2019re NTA; your mom is 100% TA!!!!", "I cannot say it any better than this. NTA.", "Hi I'm not op but I went through this as a teen. If you were a boy she wouldn't be asking you to do this. Get a hobby that gets you out of the house as much as possible, lie about how much you love it if you have to, and use it as a reason you can't babysit - 'I'm really sorry I can't, I'm at band practice, I have to study'. Study, work, make it your priority. Carve your own path and independence NOW or you'll be looking after that kid til he's in college. \n\nWhen I had my own kid young I actually decided not to have anymore/do it all again when I was the 'right' age, cos teenagers and young adults still need their parents, they don't need to be pushed aside for the fresh kid or used as free childcare.", "Yeah they probably fought to keep you. Go back.", "She sounds like my father. You express several ways in which she hurt you but the only thing she sees is the one comment you said that she's actually insulted by or at all worried about. I'm sorry OP. You deserve better.", "I had my babies at 17 & 18, and I made a metric ton of errors raising them. Their siblings have a different mom than they got. I will forever carry that guilt. I volunteer as an internet borrowed mom for you. ***YOU*** are not a mistake. Your mother made a series of mistaken choices that required you to leave before you got so mired there would be no escape.  You protected yourself when she would not and I am proud of you holding that boundary with her.", "Depends on your definition of dumb.

Ignorant ( or perhaps just stupid) people use dumb as an slang term for low IQ (stupid.)", "Well yeah, I was more talking about people who are dumb through no fault of their own, not those who are willfully ignorant.", "Cool, still not a slur like you claimed. \n\nAlso, \"dumb\" is defined as \"stupid\" in the dictionary too.", "Good luck please do it as soon as you can the go low contact with your Mom, she doesn't deserve a fabulous daughter like you. NTA. Oh and children do not owe their parents.", "I hope you are somewhere safe.  Okay, here is some motherly advise.  \n\n1) Do not have children until you are married and financially stable.  30 is a good age.\n\n2) Get into therapy.  It will help you deal with your childhood trauma, learn to set appropriate boundaries, and help you make better life choices.\n\n3) Get an education in something that is both personally fulfilling and financially rewarding.  Your 20's should be about education and career development, not partying and finding a  boyfriend/girlfriend.  \n\n4) Volunteer somewhere.  Focusing on something outside of your circumstance is good for your mental health.  If you like dogs, volunteer at a shelter.  I made really good friends volunteering in my late 20's.  It was through one of those friends that I met my husband.\n\n5) Unpopular opinion on Reddit, but if you have a faith get involved in your local church/synagogue/mosque whatever.  I am a person of faith, and my church family was extremely helpful to me during those years.

I honestly don\u2019t think I would have anything different. I\u2019ve learned you can\u2019t save someone who\u2019s not ready to be saved maybe she never would have . But it\u2019s hard to let go of dream of happy life with mom where everything will be amazing. I remember when we were all happy and I just wanted that back. The one life lesson she taught me by growing up with her  though was to do better since I didn\u2019t want to end up like her .  I went to college got a good job. I learnt also I had to do better for myself also", "NTA. Your mother is immature and emotionally abusing you. She\u2019s made it quite clear why she is a bad mother. Telling you that she regrets having you and wishing she had left you behind and then claiming you owe her makes her abusive, cruel, selfish and narcissistic. I am sorry your mother has failed you and treats you so poorly. You deserve better than the parents you got. NTA", "Unpopular opinion here.  Your mom is not the same person she was, now wants children, she can change her mind. Therapy can help with you jealously issues. You mother has an 8 month and is pregnant again. She asked you for help and get sarcasm and attitude. Yes, she is going to spend more time with a 8 month, they can\u2019t dress, eat and p**p by themselves.

Being young it's hard sometimes because in a way you are growing up with your child (especially in your moms case with being a single parent and not having that support) however that's not an excuse to make that child your emotional punching bag for the rest of their lives, or ever really. You didn't ask to be here, that was a decision she made. I hope one day you're able to distance yourself from her. You deserved a better parent, you deserved the parent it sounds like she's being to your siblings. I hope the best for you in the future OP.", "NTA.I am so sorry OP.  If you can go live with your grandparents it might be healthier for you to be there. Your mom does not deserve you.", "INFO: Does your stepfather know the entire history you laid out here? \n\nYou\u2019re NTA regardless - your mother making the \u201cone of each\u201d comment as if you\u2019re not her daughter, minimizing contact with your grandparents, and calling you her biggest regret are all unacceptable and nothing you say can be as bad or inexcusable in comparison. But I find it strange your stepdad agrees that you owe her, but also had the reaction he did to your comment. It makes me wonder if he has a rosier picture of your mother (and by extension your relationship) than is actually the case, and there may be some use in enlightening him. \n\nAlso if you are in the United States, lots of states let you move back in with your grandparents at 17. My cousin left home at 17 and her parents could do nothing about it. This varies by state, but there\u2019s a good chance.", "Agree. Get in contact with them if you aren't already. Depriving them of you and you of them due to HER disagreement with them is awful. Not to mention her overall attitude toward you. Hope you can get out soon! and if her husband says anything again, remind him of what your mom said, she's going to soon have one of each leaving no mention of you. What kind of mother does that? And also says their child owes them? No, she owes YOU.", "Fair enough. :)", "A bit OT, but please consider making a child abuse report.  Especially if there are other children in the household.  A grown man having a physical fight with a 17 year old girl is abuse, pure and simple.  Adults shouldn't get away with assaulting children.  (And yeah, I can hear it, what if the girl weighs 250 lbs & is a body-builder, and she attacked him, a tiny terrified weakling.  Right.  That's what happened. Sure it did.)", "people on power trips do some psychotic shit, but you're probably right.", "I completely agree. My daughter told her therapist when it happened and her therapist made a report to CPS. Social workers visited both houses, he put on his very convincing \"sane\" act and CPS determined that my 15 yr old daughter is still safe to live with him, but did not try to send my 17 yr old back if she's not happy there. 15F lives there nearly full time and visits me about one weekend a month (We live about 2.5 hrs apart). He has never gotten physical with my 15 yr old and I don't think he will. They have a very different relationship. He is still very controlling and emotionally unstable and irratic though. She's pretty depressed living there, especially now that her sister is gone, but she says she doesn't want to move. She doesn't want to leave her friends or her school where she's very active in choir. And she doesn't want to deal with his drama if she tries to leave him. So I just do what I can to support her from here and occasionally remind her that she has choices, like I did with my older one. When she's had her fill of him, she'll let us know.", "NTA, and any parent who tells their child that the regret having them is just an awful person. Remember you are a blessing and if she doesn\u2019t realize that, then it\u2019s her huge loss.", "Technically yes, but I understand your reasoning. Your mother has never had the type of relationship with you that made you feel special, because her idea of a relationship did not jive with how you feel. Being an afterthought is never easy for children (especially teenagers), but you really didn't need to call her dumb.", "NTA\n\nthe second you turn 18, be done with her. You're not her free sitter after years of neglect. The fact she isn't even offended when you call her out for her lack of interest in you is proof enough. Being called dumb rather than an uncaring mother genuinely hits her harder? F-that.", "NTA\n\nYou owe her nothing, she keeps saying you owe her. What do you owe her and why does she think you owe her? Maybe ask that and she'll stare at you speechless again.", "ESH.  OP for insulting mom, mom for making demands on OP for free babysitting.  I hope OP can find somewhere less toxic to live; perhaps the grandparents are available or perhaps she can afford something cheap.  Good luck to all.", "When my sister had my nephew I told her, point blankly, I would never babysit him. I don't like children. She thought I was bluffing.\n\nUntil the night she arrived at my house with my nephew and all the various other shit you need to take care of a child and expected me to look after him. When I didn't open the door, she finally understood.\n\nNever back down OP.", "Why don't you move back with them your 17 now you should be able to make that decision. If she takes it to court tell them she is trying to use you as a live in baby sitter and all of the horrible things she has said about regretting you and that your grandparents raised you and you don't want to live with your mother. Tell your grandparents", "I'm so sorry.  Sometimes CPS gets it so wrong.", "NTA- You know what's cruel and offensive telling your daughter over and over again you didn't want to have her so she owes you her life and time. \n\nSee if you can move back in with your grandparents. Because you are not a her babysitter and you don't have to be! Your kids aren't your personal slaves to do free work.", "NTA. \" She said she was going to punish me and I asked her how\" I love it. Im usually not in favor of kids disrespecting their parents but in this case I agree. Your mom is the A H, and her husband is another A H.", "NTA- you need to get your documents (birth certificate, social security card, passport if you have one, etc.) and get them somewhere safe. I know you've stated that your mom is forcing you to be low contact with your grandparents, but if you can get them these docs, you should. Would you trust your grandparents to open an account you can put money in, so that your mom can't establish financial control?\n\nI hate to recommend this, but at 17, I agree that there's  low chance that you'd be forced to return to your mom if she reported you missing or kidnapped, but you'd need your grandparents to agree to this. I will say, document every instance of verbal abuse by your mom and stepdad. If you do leave before 18, it could help. Frankly, while CPS would not remove you over this, they would open a case over it and that could slow your mom down if you left before 18.\n\nAnother option, if you have friends, is just to have as many sleepovers at theirs as is possible. I don't know how well that would go for you, but you deserve a real support network and I hope you find other respectful, caring adults and friends your own age who can help you.\n\nLastly, if you've never heard of this strategy, try gray rocking.  It's a technique for dealing with narcissists and while I don't know that your mom is one, it might help. Basically, you want to give short but civil answers to your mother. Don't give her any emotions to feed on so that she will become bored and leave you alone. Here's a couple of articles from psychology today; feel free not to use this. If you do read this, make sure to delete the history just in case your mom snoops too:\n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-time-cure/202211/when-dealing-narcissist-the-gray-rock-approach-might-help](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-time-cure/202211/when-dealing-narcissist-the-gray-rock-approach-might-help)\n\nThis article has a section on the price of gray rocking with an abusive person, please consider the argument carefully as you don't want to do something that will backfire:\n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201911/the-price-and-payoff-gray-rock-strategy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201911/the-price-and-payoff-gray-rock-strategy)", "You don\u2019t owe her anything. Furthermore as an \u201cother\u201d I can confidently report that your stepfather is ridiculous. Calling her dumb was a mild response to her outrageous behavior. Telling you that your her biggest regret is unbelievably offensive to anyone with a shred of decency or a functional heart.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. They both are, especially your mother.", "NTA. And I'm sorry you're dealing with that.\n\nYou are not the mistake here, she is. And you don't owe her for giving birth and raising you, those are not charitable acts. That is a decision she made and the OBLIGATORY responsibility that came with it.\n\nAnd being \"young\", though 20 is a fairly typical age for many to start families, is no excuse for being an emotionally distant or neglectful mother. My mother was 15 when she got pregnant with me 16 when she had me. We had LOTS of trials and tribulations through out our relationship and I wasn't quite what she hoped for. Like your mom, she wanted a sweet girly mama's girl... And got a wild, energetic tom-boy whose first word was \"No\" and when I finally got into fashion & make up it was in a style she reaaaaalllly did not like. But the one thing she never did was make me feel like a mistake. And she sure as hell never said or implied I was (she also never said I owed her for the sacrifices she made in birthing & raising me). Your mother should be ashamed. And you have every right to resist sitting, they're not your children. But I will advise not to punish or alienate your siblings to spite your mother.\n\nI'm curious, does your step-father know your mother called you a mistake?\n\nDumb, while disrespectful (but apparently warranted) is not a cruel thing to call someone. \"Mistake\" on the other hand, is beyond cruel.
