IMO, you have two choices, and I do not present these in any preferential order.\n\n1.  If you feel loved and supported by your grandparents, and living with them is a reasonable alternative (i.e. change in location would not affect which school you go to or seeing your friends), approach them about living with them.\n2. Explain in a letter to your mother without calling her names, trying to be respectful, how her words and actions have made you feel your whole life. Do not describe only the negative.  I would suggest, in fact, that in order to avoid instantly putting her on the defensive that you *start with the positive* . . . examples of things she has said or done that make you feel wanted and loved.  If you only highlight the bad and don't acknowledge the good then she has nothing to compare and contrast her behavior to, in order to highlight her shortcomings.  And, if you fail to point out the good, then you are playing into her opinion that you are ungrateful.  As best as possible, focus on her words and actions . . . and be specific.  Do NOT say things like, *\"You were a jerk to me growing up.  You always are an a-hole.\"*  Instead, say things like, *\"when you tell me that I'm selfish because I don't want to babysit, it makes me feel sad that you do not even care enough to know why, I don't want to babysit.  It makes me feel like my importance to you is only as a babysitter, and not as a daughter that you want to spend time with.\"*  At the end of the letter, and only if you want this, tell her that you want a better relationship and would like to go to therapy together.  Having a third-party, unbiased professional to point out to both of you ways to communicate better will do wonders.  Furthermore, a professional can point out your mom's mistakes in a way that does not put her on the defensive . . . and perhaps widens her perspective to see how she has wronged you and needs to change.\n\nYou are only 13, and your mom was very young when she had you, and is a better mother to your siblings primarily because life experience has helped her gain some wisdom, and her life has been easier having the stability and support of an adult partner.

Please remember that.  \n\nAt the same time, however, your mother still has a lot of learning to do as the way she has requested you to babysit and her response at your refusal is not the way a much wiser adult should behave.

My in-laws are better parents to me than mine ever were. My mom didn\u2019t even know I got a PhD. My MIL bragged to her neighbours that her \u201cdaughter is a doctor\u201d now. It was so cute haha. \n\nSorry your mom sucks and good luck with your plans to get out - you\u2019ll be so much happier.", "Mom used up all her grace and forgiveness for herself, there was none left over for her innocent baby.", "You can probably go now. Courts often don't force 17 yr olds to follow the custody orders.\n\nMy daughter (17F) had a (physical) fight with her Dad earlier this year. It was the last straw for her so she asked me to come get her. She's been living with me full time since, though the custody order is 50/50. Her dad called the police and said I had kidnapped her. They told him to go pound sand.", "Perfect. NTA. Good luck in the meantime.", "NTA. I'm so sorry OP, you deserve a parent who loves you unconditionally. Please make sure you have your birth certificate, social security card and other legal documents with you as well. I wish you all the love, happiness and health.", "Yay for OP! I was the unwanted child of older parents who thought their family was complete before I came along. As a child I dreamed of having grandparents who were nice to me  (mine were all deceased) to go to when I needed somebody to love me. \n\nI\u2019m so happy for you your grandparents are taking you in!", "I would reconsider that. In many places the police/whomever won't intervene if a 17 year old moves in with their grandparents or another safe person. Courts move slowly so even if your mom did try to force you to move back in with her, you'd very likely turn 18 before the court date.", "Hannibal? Is B.A. here too?", "NTA please do contact your grandparents and ask if you can go back to them,", "NTA. You owe her because she didn't use contraceptives? People acting like children owe parents anything, especially neglectful ones are a mystery to me. Nobody asks to be born. I would usually say it would be nice if you maybe babysat once or twice for the sake of peace in the house but in this situation absolutely not. Let her find a babysitter", "If you are 15-16 now, you could simply go to  your grandparents.  \n\n1. Go to the grandparents.\n2. Enroll in the local school.\n\nBy the time your mom got it into court, you'll be a year older and the 'status quo' would be that you are living with your grandparents and going to the local school. She may not even bother with a court process.\n\nNTA", "Tell her sucks to suck, she was stupid to sleep with a guy and get pregnant. You owe her nothing. She's not ur mom, a mother is a person who loves you and cares for you with nothing in return. From her saying you \"owe\" her shows that she is nothing but a person who gave birth to you", "NTA - She's wondering how treating you poorly your whole life could possibly cause resentment issues in you.  That is pretty dumb.", "NTA speak to your grandparents about moving back in as soon as possible. You do not owe your mother for being born and raised. No one does. It is her legal obligation.", "NTA. You \"owe\" her for what exactly - an unhappy childhood? It was her decision to birth you & she owed you a happy life", "op=NTA\n\nCalling her dumb might not be nice. but it was so minor proportionally to her comments.\n\nAnd you do NOT owe her anything but basic human respect. At this point maternal respect has gone into the shitter.  \n\nA child does not owe the parent for being brought into the world.  The parent owes the child for BRINGING them into the world.  On the most basic level that is room/board.  Food/clothing/health care.   On a moral level, to be taught the basic rules of  human engagement.  \n\nDo you have the option of living with your grandparents? Or did your mother use up all their emotional capital?", "Wow just NTA and a hug through the internet soon you'll get to leave and you'll never have to go or look back. Edit for spelling", "Your stepdad is correct. Calling your mom dumb is offensive to dumb people. NTA.", "NTA, your mom fucked around as a parent to you and found out that you\u2019re not interested in a relationship with her new family and has the audacity to make a surprised pikachu face when you have no interest.", "NTA You owe her nothing. Even if the pregnancy was unplanned there are other options and she chose to have you. In fact, she owes you as she is your mother.", "NTA\u2757", "NTA. Go to your grandparents' home if possible. In terms of your mother, there is understandable a level of resement between you with a reason. However why does you think she start dropping your much younger sister in your care, out of sudden? The novelity of a new child start to worn off, and the real difficulties of having a child start to show, and she isn't a cute girl to dress up, but real person like you and me. She would abandon her, when the boy is born, she done that before, and she would do that again. Some people are not fit to be a parent, it sucks, but it happens your mother is one those people.", "NTA I'm in your shoes. mom had me at 19, split from my dad and dropped out of college, moved around from place to place bf to bf, and now she's been with this one abusive guy for like 7 years and she can't get away. she now has a daughter with him shes 8 months old. we will never be what our mother wants. she isn't going to be what we need, she won't give us the support we seek. and I know exactly how painful that is believe me I'm trying not to cry as I write this. I had a breakdown just yesterday. I was 17 too when I left. I'm 18 now, and it's an extremely lonely feeling. I just want my mom and her to want me in the way I want her. but she doesn't. I've always been a \"carry-on\" or accessory to her. puts me on like a pair of shoes and tosses me to the side when she's bored. I think it's easier to ignore my existence for her sometimes. NTA OP, I've only watched my moms' new replacement baby twice and that's only 'cause she's a good baby and super easy. but my dad has 6 other kids I've watched forever and lemme tell you... you do not want to accept being a built-in babysitter, ever. she can and will pay someone else. not your monkey, not your circus, and get out at 18 for your health and sanity trust me. while I miss her id never in hell move back with her.", "NTA and go live with your grandparents where you are loved!  Please!  Your mother is still emotionally a child and a spoiled brat.  Your stepfather is no better!", "Nta. Please go be with your grandparents. Your mom is evil. How dare she call you a regret. Im so sorry.", "NTA My older sister was stuck with babysitting us when we were younger and then I didn\u2019t understand but I do now it\u2019s not your responsibility and for her to say she will punish you is manipulative", "Nta", "NTA. Can you move back in with your grandparents?", "\"One of each\"?!?!? Holy fucking shit\n\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou dont owe her shit. She's a bad person period. Not just a poor excuse for a mother but just a bad person.", "I'm in the same boat as op. my mom had me at 19, dropped out of college and broke up with my dad when I was 3. I've never been her priority, and now she's had a baby girl with a super abusive boyfriend, who has physically attacked me and her.... and she still chose him. I will never be enough and I can't stand it. I was 17 when I ran away. I had a breakdown yesterday after yet another conversation turned into a fight with her. I just want a mom who loves and supports me. it kills me I will never be good enough for her. I will always be an unplanned accident. and I feel like a mistake.", "This! Calling her dumb may have insulted her, but it is nowhere near as bad saying your kid is your biggest regret. That is f-ed up. I am so sorry she sucks. Best of luck moving in with your grandparents. NTA", "As a parent absolutely not. You are not owed anything nor should be given an award for the absolute bare minimum you legally have to do. You do not get to treat your children like dirt and turn around and expect to be worshipped because you paid bills. OP's mom is a terrible mother who lacks the emotional maturity to be a good mother. It's never on the child for the lack of relationship between them and their ADULT parent. The fact you think it is is sick and twisted. Reevaluate your stance.", "I'm so sorry OP. I was a twin and had three other siblings. My brother and I were the youngest. They treated my brother and my other siblings so much better than me. My dad was physically abusive, and my mum always belittled me to her friends in front of me. I was hated by both parents and siblings. As a result, it's been twenty years since I've seen any of my family. They totally disowned. Me I have no idea where they are are none of them will reach out to me. My mum used to say to me that she wished I was never born. I totally feel your pain. It's horrible. Get therapy. I wish I had. I'm 50 now and wasted my life because I didn't get my BPD and depression under control. Don't make the same mistakes as I have.", "You don't need her permission. You are almost an adult.

I\u2019m going to assume the common sense from your maternal grandparents skipped a generation. \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to get yourself to a happier environment where you can thrive soon. \n\nIt never fails to astound me as I read this forum how lovely people can have hateful kids and lovely kids can come from awful, callous parents.  Too bad we can\u2019t run a service to match the parents with the kids they deserve.", "I know someone in a similar situation and it was the best thing they did. Only issue is making sure that you keep school stuff updated. They flew to the UK so didn't have their high school diploma despite passing all their tests. \n\nSame for medical stuff.

I am so sorry\u2026 good for you for standing up for yourself though because not many can do that. You are the one being treated badly and deserve so so much more. I can\u2019t believe your mom and step dad treat you this way and have the nerve to say you are the problem. You are not the problem or the one in the wrong. You deserve better", "Uh wait, the husband says you calling your mum \u201cdumb\u201d is cruel and offensive. but a mother telling her own child that she is her \u201cbiggest regret\u201d isn\u2019t???

What a difficult and sad situation for you.", "Honestly I hate that stupid \u201cyou owe your parents for doing their fucking job shit\u201d. FUCK that. THEY decided to have a baby. THEY decided to raise you. It\u2019s THEIR job, not a fucking favor to be thankful for. I don\u2019t even think children need to be thankful for parents doing what they are supposed to do when they made the choice to bring a child into the world. IMO parents owe their children. Parents bring children into this awful cruel world, where it isn\u2019t guaranteed a good life or anything if the sort. Parents owe a good life to their children for bringing them into this world without consent. It\u2019s their job. I am a mother of two and I will never expect them to owe me a damn thing and I will forever feel like I owe them. \n\nNTA, she\u2019s a shit mother and is to stupid to see she failed as a mother. Parents who put blame onto their children for their faults are ignorant shitty people and don\u2019t deserve more.

Hearing how the mother felt/feels about her makes me determined that OP doesn\u2019t owe her any babysitting. Plus, if OP feels resentful of the loved and wanted siblings, it\u2019s understandable. Not fair to the innocent children who had nothing to do with the neglect OP grew up with, but understandable.", "You did not choose to be born. She choose to have unprotected sex and then go through with the pregnancy. She owes YOU food and shelter till you turn 18. You do not owe her anything. She made her choices even having more kids.

Even if your mom wanted to fight them in court over this, you'll be 18 soon enough and she will have just wasted the money. Your mother sounds just....she should have NEVER had children.
