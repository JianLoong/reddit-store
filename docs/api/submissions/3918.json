Your mom IS dumb if she thinks she can bully/guilt you into being a (i'm guessing free) babysitter. And mean. It sounds like she is a toxic person/mom-slinging insults once you made it clear you weren't interested in her offer/the babies. You don't have to be. Hope you are able to move out when you're 18- I know it's not always an option financially but, good luck.", "As a fellow unplanned child of a young mother, I feel you friend. I wanted to feel supported and loved too. To shake the projected feelings of regret. \n\nYou don't get that by fighting fire with fire. You can't get clean water from a dirty well. \n\nYou are NTA, you are just a kid working through complex emotional needs, and lacking a parent that can navigate those with you with any sense of emotional maturity. If your parent can't give you the support you need, reevaluate what your support network looks like, and identify other figures in your life that can help. It's a terrifying process to branch out like that, but relying on a dysfunctional parent forever isn't going to lead to good places.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you've grown up with that feeling from your mum that sucks.", "NTA\n\nChildren do not owe their parents for raising them. Not bio children, not adopted children, not foster children, not wanted children, not unwanted children. It really is that black and white. You do not owe her for being a parent, but she *did* owe you love and affection which she failed to provide. \n\nHopefully you will be away from her soon.", "NTA.  Your mom seems really into herself and her own needs.  I'm so sorry that you didn't enjoy a more happy and fulfilling childhood.", "NTA. She's the parent. Shes supposed to raise you!\n\nHer husband called you cruel for calling her dumb, but she calls you her biggest regret? Damn! That's cold. I'm so sorry.\n\nYou live your life. Family is what you make of it. They just sound like relatives, not family.", "NTA.  What her husband said- calling her dumb was cruel and offensive to others - reminds me of the line in A Fish Called Wanda where one character says to another that they are so dumb that calling them stupid was an insult to stupid people.", "I'm so sorry you've had to live with this mother. I'm glad your grandparents are supportive of you. You are definitely NTA and good for you for having boundaries.\n\nI don't know where you're located, but in Canada  you have the right to move out at 16", "Honestly you already know she regrets you. You owe her nothing. She wasn't even that young to have a child tbh. If she was 16 I'd understand her but at 20 she should have been able to step up. I'd ask your grandparents if you could live with them and leave her to her new family.", "Sounds complicated here... for the most part, I think you NTA...\n\nBut it really sounds like:\n\nA) you and mom should go to therapy to work through your history if you want a long term relationship, or\n\nB) get yourself ready to move out at 18, or whenever you're ready... don't stay in a toxic environment any longer than you have to... plan ahead... think about a job, school, future, etc... maybe move back in with your grandparents?\n\nGood luck!", "Nta. However have you ever told these feelings to your mother? Maybe speak to her about the difference you see with her towards her new babies and you. As someone who had a young mom I understand that your younger siblings got a different version of your mom. It hurts sometimes however speaking about it and therapy always helps if you need. Don\u2019t take the issues you have with your mom on your siblings. Build a bond with them. Not saying babysit but they are your family too. This isn\u2019t something they are at fault for especially bc they\u2019re infants.", "NTA can you move back with your grand parent you mother isn't a good environment for you she toxic", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sorry you're having to feel the burden of being unwanted; no child should ever have to feel that way. Is there any way you can move back in with your grandparents?", "NTA. You did absolutely nothing wrong. She blamed you for something you had no control over, did nothing for you your entire life, and now thinks you still owe her.

I never bothered telling her because it's not the first time she's told me that I ruined her life or wasn't what she wanted. There's nothing between us.

I suggest you move back with your grandparents when you can and go to therapy bc it helps a lot! Best of luck", "Thank you! That is my plan. I've got my sights set on my 18th birthday and the last time I could speak to my grandparents I brought it up to them and they were good with the plan.", "I don't think so.

But honestly, do you really think she'd try to object? In the nicest possible way I think she'd just let you go."]}
