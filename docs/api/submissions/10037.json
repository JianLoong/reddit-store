If they have received those complaints and still done nothing to change the situation, then they only have themselves to blame. I get that parenting can be extremely difficult and there may be issues that they are struggling to solve with their daughter, but in that case - they need to find somewhere to live where they aren\u2019t causing all their neighbours problems. Maybe apartment living is not for them. You\u2019re definitely NTA here.", "NTA -  I get it, having and raising kids is not easy.  And younger ones throw tantrums, its part of life.

One side was a rental property and in the 11 years I've been here, various US military families have rented it, all with children of varying ages. I've brought up my kids here. The other side of me now also has a mum with two young kids. So yeah, you get noise at various times. We all just live and let live. \n\nBut the amount of noise you appear to be living with seems to go beyond normal everyday noise. I know it can become really distressing when it's non-stop at such a level. I would probably file another complaint and say NTA. Part of the reason I say this is because the house next to me that was a rental has now been bought by a young couple with a dog. Their dog barks very often, it doesn't bother me and I don't say anything. But if my dog barks, the woman complains!

In apartment you have to get used to some lvl of noise, but that ain't it. Report them", "I have read similar posts, it is a no win situation. They have a noisy kid and it is intruding on every aspect of having any kind of peace.  They probably have tried in the past to quiet the child and have given up.  If they get evicted, they need to solve their noise problem at the next place or get evicted again, if the landlord even cares to do anything about it.  The other option is for you to move, it is absolutely unfair but people have done this to be able to function in their homes without going insane.  You are very lucky to have a landlord who cares and doing something about it.  \n\nBefore people scream at me about the housing market and keep blaming op for keeping their sanity in their very own home, life is often unfair.  If the people across the hall are getting complaints about them from multiple tenants, the have find some way to bring the noise level down to a reasonable level.  If they can\u2019t, they need to have a housing situation that accommodates them.  If the child is special needs, they have to still have to account for the rights of neighbors to have a livable environment.  It is incredibly hard to have a special needs child but it isn\u2019t other people\u2019s problem.

Also they live above me and their kids have flooded my bathroom 4 times because they turned the water on and it poured down through my bathroom ceiling in the last two months. \n\nI just find it ridiculous that I had to pay $300 security deposit for my 15lb dog that sleeps most of the day (he's an elder) and their kids above me are destroying the property/violating several noise ordinances.

When you live in a communal setting you have to be courteous and understanding of your neighbors. There isn't much reason as to why the kid is constantly having loud screaming tantrums like that. Just because someone else decides to have children doesn't mean that it should affect your own home life. That's your personal space and it shouldn't be disrupted by others so constantly.\n\nI have this same problem in my building. Since we are the end units it also means our master bedrooms share a wall so when they first moved in we could hear the child screaming bloody murder at bedtime that would last from 9:30pm to sometimes 4am. They also don't speak much English but we said something to them and things have been much better since. Still the occasional tantrum but not as loud.

Most leases in apartment complexes have something about noise levels. With that being said, why would this family move into a community living space when they have a toddler that screams like a demon? OP shouldn't have to move because another family isn't following the rules.

So, for example, she cries because she can\u2019t put on her pants, and she cries if you try to help her. She will go on like this for hours if you let her.
