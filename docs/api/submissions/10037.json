I (F33) work fully remote and am a bit of a homebody so I am usually in my apartment most of the time either working or living my life as one does.  Several months back we had a family move in across the hall from us with a little girl around 2 or 3 years old.  They moved in over the course of two weeknights, so lots of banging and shout-talking in the halls between 10-12 at night, so not a good first impression for both myself and my roommate.\n\nOver the months they\u2019ve been here, their little one has proven to be extremely vocal.  While working she will often scream bloody murder at the top of her lungs, loud enough that it feels like she\u2019s standing directly in my apartment.  I\u2019ve had people on calls with me (while I\u2019m wearing headphones) ask who is screeching in the background and I have to apologize and state that it\u2019s my neighbors child.  Even at night I will hear her screaming all the way in my bedroom, which is the farthest room in my apartment from the front door.  It\u2019s not so much \u201cI\u2019m scared\u201d screaming (that would warrant a different call) or \u201cyay I\u2019m a toddler having fun\u201d screaming, it\u2019s more \u201cI\u2019m throwing a tantrum\u201d screaming and there are some days where it\u2019s near constant.  I will be doing laundry on the bottom floor (we are on the top floor) and I can hear her all the way on the first floor just yelling and screaming clear as day.\n\nI have called and complained about them to our office (they also shout talk in the hallway to each other when they have visitors, and no carpet in the halls means it echoes and is LOUD) and I know multiple other neighbors of mine both on the same floor and downstairs have called with complaints too.  \n\nYesterday I had called in with a bad migraine and even in my room with the door closed I could hear her going full air raid siren, even until 10pm and that just made my blood boil.  It doesn\u2019t even sound like her parents try to get her to calm down.\n\nI\u2019ve spoke to my friends with kids about this and they\u2019ve told me to just \u201ckeep it moving\u201d because parenting is hard.  I am an aunt to two spectacular kids so I get it, but I don\u2019t think I should have to deal with an out of control toddler who screams all day and night.  My neighbors already have two violations for excessive noise and i believe one more could get them evicted.  While the noise is definitely an issue they have been warned about multiple times by management (i should add that they don't speak English or i would have talked to them myself) and interferes with both my work and downtime, i cant help but feel immensely guilty knowing i may get a little girl and her family evicted.  But even as i write this post, she is banshee shrieking and has been on and off for close to a half hour.\n\nWIBTA if i filed another noise complaint, even though it may result in a family getting evicted?\n\nEDIT: Just making an edit to answer some questions I've been seeing asked repeatedly on here:\n\n- Noise cancelling headphones aren't always an option for me.  My job requires I make calls and I can't make & take calls with earplugs in.  Also I\u2019ve had people tell me they can hear her over said headphones, which is embarrassing \n\n- My office space is in an open area so I can't really noise-proof my home office.\n\n- It costs $1000 to break my lease and I have a roommate to consider.  I've also been in my apartment for 8 years and they've only been here for 4-5 months.  The only thing getting broken around here are eardrums and my patience.\n\n- I have no clue if she's on the spectrum or not or if she has a disability.\n\n- I don't suspect abuse and have not called CPS, however a wellness check may be in order... \n\nAlso in my post when I said \"I'm an aunt, I get it\" I mean that I understand kids can be LOUD.  I get it to a fault, not completely as I'm not a parent, but I understand.\n\nThank you very much for all the feedback that has been given so far, I really appreciate it!", "created_utc": 1676482375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1133kot/wibta_if_i_filed_another_noise_complaint_about_my/", "score": 3329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they have received those complaints and still done nothing to change the situation, then they only have themselves to blame. I get that parenting can be extremely difficult and there may be issues that they are struggling to solve with their daughter, but in that case - they need to find somewhere to live where they aren\u2019t causing all their neighbours problems. Maybe apartment living is not for them. You\u2019re definitely NTA here.", "NTA -  I get it, having and raising kids is not easy.  And younger ones throw tantrums, its part of life.

One side was a rental property and in the 11 years I've been here, various US military families have rented it, all with children of varying ages. I've brought up my kids here. The other side of me now also has a mum with two young kids. So yeah, you get noise at various times. We all just live and let live. \n\nBut the amount of noise you appear to be living with seems to go beyond normal everyday noise. I know it can become really distressing when it's non-stop at such a level. I would probably file another complaint and say NTA. Part of the reason I say this is because the house next to me that was a rental has now been bought by a young couple with a dog. Their dog barks very often, it doesn't bother me and I don't say anything. But if my dog barks, the woman complains!

In apartment you have to get used to some lvl of noise, but that ain't it. Report them", "I have read similar posts, it is a no win situation. They have a noisy kid and it is intruding on every aspect of having any kind of peace.  They probably have tried in the past to quiet the child and have given up.  If they get evicted, they need to solve their noise problem at the next place or get evicted again, if the landlord even cares to do anything about it.  The other option is for you to move, it is absolutely unfair but people have done this to be able to function in their homes without going insane.  You are very lucky to have a landlord who cares and doing something about it.  \n\nBefore people scream at me about the housing market and keep blaming op for keeping their sanity in their very own home, life is often unfair.  If the people across the hall are getting complaints about them from multiple tenants, the have find some way to bring the noise level down to a reasonable level.  If they can\u2019t, they need to have a housing situation that accommodates them.  If the child is special needs, they have to still have to account for the rights of neighbors to have a livable environment.  It is incredibly hard to have a special needs child but it isn\u2019t other people\u2019s problem.

At first it was noise, screaming, but the parents never disciplined the kids, and it got worse. They just let the children run free and turn their tv on max. I made countless reports and police calls, but the landlord stopped listening to me. Also they live above me and their kids have flooded my bathroom 4 times because they turned the water on and it poured down through my bathroom ceiling in the last two months. \n\nI just find it ridiculous that I had to pay $300 security deposit for my 15lb dog that sleeps most of the day (he's an elder) and their kids above me are destroying the property/violating several noise ordinances. The cops stopped showing up even with half the building calling.  \n\nOP if you can document the noise, the police reports, noise complaints, and pull the noise violations in your area - You can probably get out of your lease early because they are disturbing the peace.

That's your personal space and it shouldn't be disrupted by others so constantly.\n\nI have this same problem in my building. Since we are the end units it also means our master bedrooms share a wall so when they first moved in we could hear the child screaming bloody murder at bedtime that would last from 9:30pm to sometimes 4am. They also don't speak much English but we said something to them and things have been much better since. Still the occasional tantrum but not as loud.

Because they need to realize the landlord will follow through, and apartment living comes with responsibilities, even with a toddler in tow. There are serious consequences for their actions (or in this case, inaction). They don't try to get their toddler to settle.

I would think you\u2019re living in the same building if it weren\u2019t for the dollar signs you\u2019ve used in your post (I\u2019m in England). I too am an aunt to 2 kids. I work from home. The type of shrieking the child makes, your description, spot on! When you\u2019re on the floor below, the tantrums sound like she\u2019s lying on the floor of their flat stomping both her hands and feet. My neighbours are also not native English speakers. I\u2019ve seen the child once when she was screaming in the balcony and she is in the same age range. My bedroom window is far on the other end of the flat and I can see up at their balcony. She was screaming by herself while banging wooden spoons on the balcony railing.\n\nI tried being cordial and wrote them a note and put it in their mailbox. That was 2 months ago and nothing has changed. This week I\u2019ve had to make an official complaint to the management company because although I sympathise with the parents, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s much harder for them and I understand and accept that some noises cannot be helped living in a flat, I should be allowed to enjoy living in my home. I see no effort being made from the parents to improve the current situation either. Similar to your neighbours, the child is at home all day everyday. Unless they take her out the exact same time I leave my home (which is not often and never routine)!\n\nAnyway sorry OP you\u2019re going through this. I really do understand what you\u2019re going through. Hope something turns for the better for you. If not, let\u2019s count the days until she starts school ;)\n\nEdit: forgot to add NTA", "For many renters, apartment living is the only affordable and accessible option for housing.  Assuming OP lives in a predominately English-speaking country, the neighbours are likely immigrants, making them more likely to be low-income. Additionally, most employment available to immigrants is in cities (ex. Uber, construction, truck-driving, customer service, etc.). Of course I am speculating (what else is Reddit for?), but the alternative to apartment living for this family may very well be the shelter system.\n\nThat said, having loud noise, screaming, etc. at all hours of the day is incredibly frustrating. Tenants have a right to reasonable enjoyment of their housing. OPs frustration is valid. However, there are options beyond pointing the finger at the family. \n\nOne option is to invite them over for coffee or start saying \"hi\" in the hallways. They may speak a different language amongst themselves and still speak English. Creating a relationship may open the door to determining if their toddler has some learning/developmental concerns. This may also provide an opportunity for OP to emphasize the effects the screaming has on her and other tenants' enjoyment of their own homes. \n\nAnother option is for OP to begin holding her landlord/building manager accountable. OP noted that the hallways aren't carpeted, she can sometimes hear the crying all the way downstairs, etc. To me, this sounds like there may be some ineffective insulation, no steps to mitigate noise between units, etc. I have lived in several apartments now and I can tell the difference between units made cheaply and ones where thought was given to the people who would actually live in the unit. My last apartment, I could hear my neighbours television through my wall - it wasn't even at an obnoxious volume, I could just hear Better Call Saul word-for-word. In contrast, my current apartment is SILENT. I can OCCASIONALLY hear the faint sound of an infant crying in the apartment to my right, but it is sufficiently muffled. Our units are not wide, so the insulation is doing a lot of heavy lifting. \n\nAll this to say - people have kids and people with kids need places to live, even if those kids are not well-behaved/dealing with delayed development. Hold OPs landlord accountable for insufficient insulating rather than the tenants with a difficult child. \n\nOP is NTA, but OP's actions could very well result in these tenants losing their home with cause (which could have steep financial consequences, as well as not-having-a-home consequences).", "I\u2019m working on that.

That's what the yard is for. \n\n\nBut we've also told her she still has to keep it to reasonable levels. However she's 5 going on 6 so she knows better now.", "They don\u2019t speak English.  I tried to say hi and strike up a conversation when they first moved in and they just shook their head and said \u201c\u2018no English.\u201d", "I\u2019ve only ever lived in apartments as an adult and there have plenty of babies, kids, and toddlers. Even the most obnoxious of them didn\u2019t screech all the time. Call in a noise complaint, OP. You can\u2019t work or live like that. The parents need to learn how to parent in an apartment building if they\u2019re going to insisting on living in one with a toddler.", "> Still going with NAH because this isn't the right environment for her and OP has a right to live in her own home without hearing a toddler screaming at all hours.\n\nThis is the crux of the matter, isn't it. Where I live, tenants have what's called a \"right to quiet enjoyment\" of their living space. This means it's absolutely the landlord's responsibility to create as safe and quiet a living space as they can reasonably provide. They can't do anything about construction down the road or loud people on a neighbouring property they don't own, but they *can* do something about a loud tenant in a nearby unit in the same building. Sometimes that something is eviction.\n\nWhile I hope the parents here can find a way to manage their little girl, the landlord is required to uphold their end of the leases for all the other tenants. The rights of one toddler and her parents do not trump the rights of the entire rest of the building. If there's a clause for a right to quiet enjoyment or something similar, management's hands are tied and the problem tenants will have to go.", "I think this comment is underrated. Regardless of whether it's a pet or a child your neighbor decided to have them and regardless of if they have some sort of physical or mental disability It really doesn't matter. You and your neighbors did not choose to have this child in the building that was constantly interrupting your daily lives and in your case your work. You have just as much of a right as they do to live a comfortable life in a place where you pay rent without constant interruption.\n\nYou WNBTA if you report them OP. You have a right to live in your building without this nuisance risking your health and your job.", "Or the kid might not be autistic, and might be screaming because their parents are shouting at each other and that's scary and upsetting when you're little. Either way, the grownups need to act like grownups and cut that shit out.", "If only!", "Not in the long run, as soon as something else happens he doesn't like he'll start again. It's just a phase they go through learning how to be decent, patient people. That's the downside of apartment living.", "I'm also thinking that the parents are just straight up ignoring her tbh. I think OP needs to just make a call to CPS and let CPS get involved.\n\nPoor wording on my part with \"make sure\" so I admit that one.\n\nI do think though the parents need to do what they can to mitigate as much screaming as possible because it's not fair to make their child a problem of other tenants no matter how indirect it is.\n\nI really hope no one nearby that can hear said child works night shift because it sounds like no sleep for them. I work night shift and you best believe I would go as far up the food chain as I had to if another person's kid was becoming my problem and possibly indirectly influencing my livelihood if I had to call out of work due to migraines, being so sleepy I can't drive safely, etc. Edit to add that I know this in particular isn't something OP has to worry about with day shift and working from home, but I'm also thinking of others that might be in hearing range vicinity.\n\nYes, they all probably pay the same amount of rent or close to it, but don't make your kid another person's problem no matter how indirect that is.", "Ugh, this. I (blessedly) don\u2019t have kids, but have two nephews who I adore. This past weekend, I watched in silent panic as the 3 year old had multiple insane, ear-splitting crying fits over *nothing*. He wanted a snack, I asked him what he\u2019d like, he loses his shit. He finally says what he wants, his mom asks him to show me where it is, he loses his shit. I\u2019m literally trying to give him what he wants and he\u2019s acting like we\u2019re all torturing him. Thankfully, that\u2019s not quite the norm with him, he was just overtired, but daaaaaaamn. My sweet little buddy went full demon baby! You said it, there\u2019s just absolutely no reasoning with them in that situation. My SIL was also overtired to the point of struggling to keep her eyes open and yet she stayed calm and got him through it. Whereas I\u2019m standing there in horror, mentally taking a vow of celibacy. \n\nBut thankfully, they don\u2019t live in an apartment, so letting him lose his tiny little shit was only affecting their own household. She would definitely remove him from a situation where he was disturbing other people.", "Didn\u2019t OP say the family that moved in didn\u2019t speak English? Hmm\u2026arguably hard to communicate in an entirely different language in which you don\u2019t personally speak.", "Shit, I wasn\u2019t diagnosed with ADHD or Autism until adulthood, and I still understood as a toddler that there were \u201coutside noises\u201d and \u201cinside noises.\u201d As long as the rules are consistently and fairly enforced, neither Autistic nor ADHD children have any problems following them. They just need to have it explained *why* it\u2019s necessary, because neurodivergent kids don\u2019t generally accept things at face value. We want to *understand* things, not just blindly obey. \n\nBut if you explain to them that being too loud and wild indoors causes other people discomfort or even pain, and that\u2019s why we have to be careful about our volume while we\u2019re inside? Most ND kids will have no problem taking that to heart and will make an effort to manage their own outbursts. They might not always be successful, but they\u2019ll be clearly trying to be, and that counts for a lot.", "She could be a runner! Or a sensory based child and playground is too much. Try my suggestion of calling social services clarify it\u2019s not suspected abuse but the family seems isolated, does not speak English, and seems overwhelmed. They could benefit from community resources they may not know are an option. Be part of a solution", "Being stuck inside all the time is probably why the kid is screaming all the time. She\u2019s frustrated and miserable and her parents clearly aren\u2019t *listening* to her.\n\nTo be honest, she\u2019s probably just as miserable as you are right now.", "I don\u2019t follow \ud83d\ude4a", "I have a toddler (2.5) and it is literal hell if we don\u2019t go out the house at least once a day. It\u2019s leads up to pent up energy and big feelings and it explodes all at once. Not. Fun. We\u2019ve been pretty much confined inside for the last week because we\u2019ve all been sick. It\u2019s been snowing like crazy too. I planned as many activities in our home as possible, but still it\u2019s hard. My toddler doesn\u2019t nearly do what OP describes and he\u2019s generally just a happy guy but he just becomes this wild child if he\u2019s locked up all day. Going out of the house is really for US because it makes the rest of the day smoother. \n\nWe are finally healthy again and I\u2019m so looking forward to taking him out tomorrow.", "I had a kid like that when I first moved in my apartment, i could hear him yelling almost 24/7. He lived at ground floor and i was at third floor! Occasionally you would also hear his mother scream to him. It stopped only when they moved out", "Or maybe there are people that have lived in apartments their whole lives and have dealt with a lot of different situations. Literally have moved from disruption, children can be the worst but honestly you can't tell people where to live.", "I took care of one of those screaming toddlers at night for a few months because every time my relative took them to the doctor saying there is something wrong with this baby they got reported to CPS. They found no medical problem so decided it was a parent problem. I was able to get the baby to sleep at my large house where there was absolute silence. When the screaming toddler turned 3 they were finally diagnosed with autism. The mother knew from a really early age that there was a problem but medical people were no help at all. It was really awful for everyone and I\u2019m glad I could help for a little while. I\u2019m sure that their apartment neighbors were also losing their minds. I kept the baby at night until they could move into a house.", "If you\u2019ve got everything documented, take the property mgmt company/landlord to small claims court.", "Not to mention keeping toddlers indoors all the time. No wonder the kid is screaming; if someone kept a dog penned up inside like that 24/7, we\u2019d be dragging them for animal cruelty!\n\nI grew up in apartments at that age, and if I got too loud, my mom would make me \u201ctake it outside\u201d and don\u2019t come back in until I could \u201ckeep it to a dull roar.\u201d \n\nChildren need to play outside. They need freedom and fresh air and a place they can run all that extra energy out. They\u2019re not meant to be stuck inside all day, every day.", "It legit doesn't sometimes. My nephew went through a phase like this back when I was nannying him. He would have full-on shrieking meltdowns over shit like his grapes being too rolly or his sweater string having the wrong kind of ends. Of course, cutting the grapes or getting a new string for the sweater had no effect, he was goddamn inconsolable.\n\nThat shit lasted for over a YEAR. It was hellish, and he was a totally normal kid on either side of it, just that one phase of development was fucking rough.", "You guys must have some real high end noise cancelling headphones.", "Finally, some sense\u2026 my brother and I NEVER did this as kids, my mom attests to this day, simply because\u2026 It wasn\u2019t tolerated! And so it didn\u2019t happen! \u270b\ud83c\udffbkids will do exactly as much as they can get away with before genuinely unpleasant consequences occur. No less, and usually no more. Where that line is drawn is completely up to the parents.", "It really takes the stress out of kids when you take them outside, if the weather and time allow."]}
