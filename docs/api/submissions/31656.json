We agreed with everyone last week we'd do a group order.\n\nSo yesterday I paid the first month of the subscription and told everyone I was gonna order stuff for me and T, except there was a buncha stuff in the cart already and I didn't know it whose it was, so I just put it somewhere else. But mates suddenly became active and asked me to order the stuff in the cart as well for them and order for everyone because the subscription only allows one delivery per day and we agreed for the first group order last week.\n\n I told them no, because I I didn't know whose was what and it was just going to be a giant mess since we don't share our food so we'll have to divide everything again and it's just dumb, idk who'd have to pay what. I told them they could order before me if they wanted, I didn't mind waiting, I prefered it to the giant mess that would result if I actually did order everything. Again no reaction. So I assumed that meant it was ok for me and T to order. But afterwards I checked and they obviously didn't listen to me because they didnt react and just deleted me and Ts stuff from the cart and added their stuff back? Tf bro? They're also acting weird in our group with me now because I agreed to do a group order with them but I ditched them and did it with just T and I didn't mind ordering for T but made excuses when it was for everyone. They've always paid me back on stuff I paid for them (most of them at least) but I'm just not ok with ordering all that and running after them to get paid back, especially since it's a lot of money.\n\n\nThis is stupid af but am I in the wrong ?

It\u2019s clear this idea isn\u2019t working.  \n\nI suggest you find an alternate way of ordering (ie agree each person can order on different days, have separate accounts etc). \n\nMy guess is that your friends group is hoping you\u2019ll agree to being in charge of organizing everything and dealing with the hassle of multiple people owning you separate amounts and you\u2019ll end up paying for people who \u201cforget\u201d to reimburse you.  \n\nDon\u2019t do it.", "I am confused so they took your groceries out of the cart and expect you to pay?

It sounds like they were counting on you and T paying for the entire order and were planning to make excuses afterwards about why they can't pay you back when they already have the groceries on your dime.

And the account wasn't created by me so it isn't mine it's ours I suppose. I don't know why they took my item out bro, they're acting like it's chill for me to pay for everyone but for me it isn't. I am a bit poorer than them even if I dislike to act like it. I know they will pay me back but I just don't want to have to go through all that trouble lol I am also the only one who actually paid the subscription fee since I saw they weren't taking any step towards doing it (while the entire goal was to split that subscription) and I don't want to starve this weekend.  I have no idea how they'll pay me back on that.", "They didn't pay for it at all. The account isn't mine, it's an old account they used last year for this. They told me last year they alternated on who paid the subscription each month, and since no one volunteered to pay for the first month now, I just did it cause I can't go to the grocery store this weekend I have lots of assignments.", "They said they've done it before and it worked just fine \ud83d\ude2d", "I don't have a car and the closest grocery store is very far away. This is arguably the cheapest option considering taking the bus forth and back would cost me like 6$, and it's not Uber it's the grocery stores websites so apart from the delivery fee of the subscription  (10$)  it's way cheaper and optimal overall, especially considering I don't pay the subscription fee alone.", "How am I not an adult?

You will happily venmo or Zelle people if they order the full amount. Separately the subscription cost that you all agreed to split is x dollars so that makes your portion y. If you could please send it to me via (preferred cash app) by z date that would be greatly appreciated.", "Get your own Account", "They could have also ordered and you paid them back for your items. But if that\u2019s not good enough, it\u2019s probably best that they have their own subscription", "wouldn\u2019t that be unfair considering month to month the needs would be different. that means it\u2019s never going to be a set amount. everyone just pays a month no questions. no way man. i have amazon and there\u2019s tons of other places that deliver without a subscription. this seems unnecessarily complicated and like someone is always going to get screwed into paying more for certain peoples things. when they know its their month are they going to purposely order less so they pay less on their month. it makes no sense.", "Don\u2019t *order* it until they pay you.", "You're right. Thanks man.", "NTA.\nremove yourself from that grocery list group.  \nDo your shopping for your stuff only,  and let everyone else deal with their own.\n\nYou will find out that in life,  it's best to keep yourself out of groups like this,  you gain nothing (but headaches & hassles) from being in a group like this.", "NTA. Don't ever do 'group' ideas where money is involved. It never works out well how it does in your head. Sure, its a great idea on paper... if you're living in a hippy commune. This is why so many communal living arrangements don't work out. Don't ever join a project if you have no concept of how it will actually work beyond a surface level thought.", "I'm too confused by your writeup to tell who's the asshole. Frankly I feel like you and the roommates are too confused too.\n\nSimplify this or everyone goes shopping alone again (which sounds way easier than this nonsense).", ">I told them no, because I I didn't know whose was what and it was just going to be a giant mess since we don't share our food so we'll have to divide everything again and it's just dumb\n\nIf this is the case then making one account was dumb", "NTA. Get rid of the joint account. Let em fend for themselves.", "NTA get out of the group thing and do your own shopping.", "NTA - I tried something like this with a roommate when I was around your age. Our arrangement was a little different. She wanted to split all groceries and just have a general pot, but I bought fewer groceries, but high quality and organic, while she and her daughter bought the cheapest (and most unhealthy) they could find. She wanted to eat my food even though they had different value. I told her not to touch my food and buy her own. She was PISSED but sometimes you have to set boundaries when people try to take advantage.", "They are hoping you will do all the work and pay too! Easy to put you off to pay- not so easy to put off the grocery store!", "I think you shouldn't make assumptions on what's cheaper or not for them. Since they're not you and all.", ">Money is obviously tight with you and you are getting groceries delivered to your home which is much more expensive.\n\nThe food costs exactly the same amount. Pay \u00a36.99 a month delivery fees at Tesco which would allow a delivery up to every day . If you order once a week that's \u00a31.75 a week. That's cheaper than getting the bus there and back for most people.\n\nOr \u00a34.99 a month and be limited to \"off peak\" (after 3pm) delivery slots \n\nIn what world is it \"much more expensive\"", "That's literally what they tried to do. Can you not read?", "Take their names off the account since you were the one that paid the subscription.", "You can do that now", "Methinks they lied. \ud83d\ude05", "I assumed the subscription is just the delivery fee. So for example you can subscribe to Tesco delivery for \u00a36.99 a month. Or \u00a34.99 \"off peak\" (after 3 pm). \n\nOr you can pay for each delivery, but depending on which delivery slot you chose it's \u00a33-\u00a37 per delivery. So if you order from there regularly it makes no sense not to subscribe. (except its a 6 month minimum subscription so then you are tied in)\n\nYou still have to buy the food, that's seperate to the delivery subscription", "Even offering to Venmo / Zelle them will probably result in one party subsidizing the other if you live in a place that has sales tax and don't calculate it. Also who pays the delivery guy's tip? This arrangement is too much of a hassle to work. Get your own account.", "ah i don\u2019t know about those things. i live in the country and go to the store but will order from the large stores that offer free delivery"]}
