French toast recipes can vary a lot but be completely covered up when you add syrup. I feel like it's just as likely that op is the one misremembering, since they were the kid in that shared history. It's also likely mom has always made it this way for herself. Op has been away from home for years and just moved back so I don't think they have much standing to argue how they think their mother \"always\" made things.\n\nOp and mom told each other to google it because they werent just arguing over shared history, but primarily over which of them had the recipe objectively correct. They don't live in the USA so the sweet version is not necessarily correct.", "Idk if I understand it wrong haha. But it is two different things.

Is this a joke?\u201d and it\u2019s why OP kept asking. \n\nWe never once ate frozen pizza when I was a kid. If I came to my parents house and found my mom making one, I\u2019d say something like, \u201cHey, you\u2019re finally trying a frozen pizza! What brand did you get?\u201d If my mom\u2019s response to that was, \u201cWhat do you mean? We had these every Friday night for your entire childhood,\u201d I would be understandably confused. At first I\u2019d think she was making a joke. If she then went on to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Tons of people eat frozen pizza!\u201d I would be like, \u201cRight, but I didn\u2019t think *you* had ever been one of those people.\u201d At that point, if my mom continued to double down that we had all eaten frozen pizza weekly for the first 18 years of my life, I\u2019d be anywhere between worried and irritated. \n\nThe point isn\u2019t that the issue of the French toast recipe is trivial, the issue is that OP doesn\u2019t understand why their mom is lying to them about it.", "Maybe it\u2019s a U.S thing, or just your recipe. I\u2019m in Canada and I have never heard of that much cinnamon in a French toast recipe. I would say the ones I\u2019ve made have averaged 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp for the whole recipe.
