This is absolutely not something to say \u201cshut the f up\u201d to someone over; where did that even come from? It honestly makes me think they wanted to play with him just so they could shit on him when he doesn\u2019t know how to play and loses.", "NTA, you didn't ruin anything. Your BIL and sister are the AH. The minute anyone tries to force you to do something and tells you the shut the F up, it's time to go. They ruined the get together not you or your husband.", "Wait, there's a new Settlers of Catan expansion? Y W B T A if you didn't give me details.\n\n(Just kidding. We're on the internet, I'll look it up.)\n\nMore seriously, you're NTA. His sister's husband sounds like a terrible host and rude as hell. You did a good job trying to help your husband opt out in a non-disruptive way, and your BIL couldn't help but be an asshole about it.", "Games are supposed to be fun, right?  Your SIL and BIL do not understand fun. Forcing people to play games and telling them to shut the f up is not it. Seems like there could have been a number of ways to work this out without them escalating.  NTA", "NTA. BIL overreacted and disrespected you two. Leaving was the right thing to do. You two aren't the ones who ruined it.", "NTA. I hope you will get around to telling your BIL he\u2019s a giant asshole. I would never go back there without an apology from him, and from your sister for letting him speak to you that way.", "The guy told you \u201cmy house my rules\u201d and \u201cshut the F up.\u201d Ok, so automatically you\u2019re NTA. That\u2019s easy. But there\u2019s a lot more going on here. Your sister in law is trying to defend and placate her husband by blaming you for his terrible behavior. Meanwhile, he\u2019s chasing away her family and isolating her. That\u2018s a massive concern.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He then proceeded to tell me this was his house his rules and I needed to shut the F up. \" ..

You advocated for you husband, which I'm sure he appreciated, and offered a perfectly acceptable compromise (playing without him). The second your BiL pulled the \"my house my rules\" card and swore at you, he became a RAGING AH.\n\nTell your husband's sister the only person who ruined the family thing was her husband with his crap attitude.

Wise move", "Nta.", "It\u2019s a long time from Thanksgiving!  This must  be really bothering you.   I would ask your husband for his true feelings on this incident.  He  doesn\u2019t speak up, how do you know for sure he won\u2019t want to play, even if it is just to please?   I\u2019d allow him to own the consequences and state his own desires to these people.

I don't think your sister chose wisely who she married because he sounds like a BIG A. Standing up for your husband will never be wrong, that's a kind thing you did for him.", "NTA. I really hope your husband defended you against his sister\u2019s husband \ud83d\ude10 I WISH one of my siblings S/O would talk to my S/O like that. The fucking audacity.", "The BIL would be dead to me. I would never set foot in their house again and I would never let him in mine.", "He has apparently had to resort to making it a rule that anyone who sets foot in his house is liable to being conscripted into his games, so I think you hit the nail on the head.", "I think he was really mad at me because no one has ever spoken up for my husband before. My husband is no spring chicken - even though this was my FIRST thanksgiving with his family, he was already pushing 60. He let his sister\u2019s family control his life and they scared away every girlfriend he had until me.", "It\u2019s not a \u201cnew\u201d expansion set, it was just new to him lol. Settlers of Catan is actually my favorite board game!", "Thank you", "At that moment I didn\u2019t say anything to her but I did feel like she was a victim but didn\u2019t seem to know she was? Is that even possible? I mean she\u2019s not a child. She\u2019s over 50! Btw I forgot to mention in the post, she also told me she hates the game too but she would have played anyway because it\u2019s family time. (The irony is that settlers of catan is actually my favorite board game so it could have been a fun night for me if I wasn\u2019t worried about my husband\u2026)", "This was the first time I was at a family get together with them. Second time I ever met her husband. No one ever spoke up to him before so I don\u2019t think she expected anything to go wrong.", "Thank you. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have any relationship with my husband\u2019s sister.", "Thank you. That was all thanks to my husband. I probably would have tried to de-escalate which probably would have made it worse.", "I think that was the point the BIL was trying to make - how would I know my husband wouldn\u2019t want to play. Although for anyone that knows this game, I would have thought they would understand the idea of playing the expansion set without the knowledge of the basic game is quite insane.", "No lol. He would never speak up. He did take me out of there right away which I thank him for. And he never went back to that house again. It\u2019s been over 4 years. Of course he never liked his sister\u2019s husband anyway but he was very close to his sister. They are still pretty close but not like it used to be. But that\u2019s not because of that one incident. I think that\u2019s mostly because I stuck around. His sister got rid of all of his previous girlfriend. I stayed.", "Ah ok I see now, this was HIS family (sorry I get turned around a lot in these sometimes lol). I completely understand because I\u2019m a people-pleaser like your husband. I come from a narcissistic family system too. I\u2019m glad he has you to speak up for him and that you don\u2019t take advantage of him like his family did. I hope you had a nice thanksgiving together regardless!", "With an attitude like hers and her husband\u2019s I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want one! Sheesh! Maybe skip some family events for a bit and do your own thing together \ud83d\udc95", "Thank you. This actually happened 4 years ago. My husband never went back there again. Clearly this has bothered me a lot. I feel bad that I\u2019ve ruined his relationship with the closest (distance wise) family members he\u2019s got. He still maintains a relationship with his sister - she has come to visit us three times in the last 4 years, never bringing her husband with her.", "Wow, that was his own family? They should already have known better. The best way to handle it would have been to make you and your husband one team, play the first couple of moves together, and then not make a big deal about it when he retreated to the couch or whatever. NTA.", "You didn\u2019t ruin anything. If it wasn\u2019t this, it would have been something else, trust me.", "Yes if I could turn back time, I guess I would have just played along. Not sure if the brother in law would have let my husband retreat to the couch at any given point though.", "The man is an AH."]}
