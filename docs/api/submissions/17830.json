It is ridiculous.", "NTA. Wtf. Sorry you guys had to deal with that. Fuck that guy", "I think an easy alternative here would be to play on a team with your husband. You all can play and when he's ready to take a break he can walk away. When there are questions about strategy you can decide. If he's doing well you can take a break.

Not very hospitable and not very loving. BIL is TA. Glad you are standing up for your hubby. That's what married people should do.", "NTA. \n\nIf it comes up again, \"The only person who ruined anything that night was your husband. If you ever need a safe place to stay, let us know.\"", "NTA. What kind of insanity is \"My house my rules\" when  intended to force someone to play a game?", "Interesting. First and foremost absolutely NTA. I am ND and absolutely LOATHE board games like that. I wonder if that\u2019s a thing with people like us.", "NTA. I love Catan but I would never force someone to play if they don\u2019t like it.", "NTA  \n\n\nGood for you to stand up for your husband.  And while he won't make waves himself, good on him for packing up and taking you away when they got mad at you.", "NTA, your BIL needs to learn how to respect other people. Telling you to \"shut the fuck up\" was unacceptable behavior, I don't give a shit who's house it was.", "Um your BIL sounds psychotic. I would have left too than let anyone speak to me or my partner like that. NTA, good on you!", "NTA\n\nI get that its not everyone's cup of tea.   Im more into board games than my husband and we used to host board game nights.   What I found is that he (and some of our other friends) enjoyed the social aspects of getting together, but not everyone was up for the strategy type games.   That has led to us doing more \"party type\" games where everyone  just has a lot of laughs.   As for our friends that despise board games altogether, we just mercifully invite friends who enjoy that sort of thing.", "You\u2019re husband is an adult, right? I don\u2019t think you should speak for other adults. He could choose to play, or not.", "Nta. And may I say thank you for taking up for your husband, and then he took up for you.\nI wish you guys the best marriage. You already sound like a great couple.", "NTA. I like a lot of weird board games, but bil is a jerk, and sil is also a jerk. Willing to bet they counted on being able to beat the snit out of your husband to make themselves feel better.", "These stories man. Hard to believe any of them or anyone is actually asking if they are TA. \n\nLike, obviously, trying to force someone to play is shit and \"my house my rules\" is the point you say \"cool see ya\". \n\nWhy even post? Obvious answer.", "Holy shit, he went from 0 to 60 and overreacted and was a huge asshole when he told you to shut the fuck up. Then his sister also was an asshole just like him when she told you to keep your mouth shut. So much insults and disrespect. NTA.", "NTA and wow his sister and BIL are monsters.", "Host tries to dictate board game participation? Screw that. No wonder they find it 'dfficult to organise family things', if that's the way they behave when they are hosting.\n\nEdited to add: NTA.", "NTA\n\nThose people don't have guests they have participants. You don't owe anyone your time,  particularly those who drain your joy.", "You cracked me up!! It made me laugh imagining you creating your own game rofl.", "Omg I feel so VALIDATED BY THIS!! And I am neurodivergent. I honestly have always felt so damn stupid and like a stick on the mud when people invite me to play board games. And internally I\u2019m thinking \u201cno, I\u2019d rather stub my toe on the coffee table\u201d.", "This legit made me laugh out loud. My sweetheart of a SIL gave this to our family as a holiday present one year. And I opened it\u2026 read the directions\u2026 and quietly put it away.", "Thank you. I never thought of it like I did something good so thank you. I know once our relationship became steady, I told myself that I would always stand up for him against his family. He never asked me to - in fact, he thinks his sister is a good person and good to him. The fact she drives all of his girlfriends away is because she loves him and she\u2019s never met anyone good enough for him. I almost left just like all of his previous girlfriends actually. Between his ND and his sister\u2019s words, it would take someone quite crazy to stay. I stayed because in the back of my mind, I had my suspicions about her. (I\u2019ve told him how I feel about her but he doesn\u2019t believe me.) So every time I see her, I make an effort to tell her how great her brother is - because he is, and because I know it drives her crazy. (Now I legit sound like an AH\u2026) Whenever i compliment about him, she\u2019s radio silent.", "I love the game myself so I know what you mean. If I didn\u2019t like it we would have just bailed probably.", "That dude sucks, but in more reasonable company you can just claim your husband to be on your team.  My mom and dad do that so she can get up and wander off when she gets bored", "Oh, love! You are amazing! It is no small feat to be the radar for our beloveds before they can see it. And you do not sound like an AH, you sound like a sane partner. My sane partner saved my life.  \n\n\nYou did not ask for this and I am only offering in all the gentlest kindness, but maybe see if your BF would see an IFS therapist or CPTSD trained therapist? If not, you could always read (with the BF) Stan Tatkin books, maybe take any of his couple workshops (if you can) or maybe see an IFIO (Intimacy from the Inside Out) therapist. \n\nMy family was cruel to me for years...it's a whole story that took being with a partner who was healthily bonded to their family for me to realize that my family was just like your BFs family. It was like I was in a fog, but it was all I knew and then seeing how another family tended to each other, held boundaries, said No to each other, didn't gossip or triangulate- and I was like WTF magical-weirdness if this?   \n\n\nIrene Clayton PhD and Patrick Teahan have amazing YouTube channels that really helped me. And Internal family Systems and reading all kinds of CPTSD books (if you want I can send titles- I'm just aware I am already veering into tender territory and want to be respectful). \n\nBig, big hugs to you happilytorn!", "Ooh i missed up word \"in law\" from brother in law and thought it was a brother.\n\nBut yeah..it's hard but your husband is grown adult now. He can (or allowed) voice his disinterest or disagreement on something.\n\nI do say no to outings clearly but falls on deaf ears, but what I did in the end is just sit and not participate. If they say why i was sulking, i go \"i did say i dont want to do this loud and clear and i am now.\"", "In fact I do. However, I also think that his wife knows him a lot better than you do so you\u2019re opinion counts for shit.", "Omg no!!! What a wonderful partner you are to speak up for him."]}
