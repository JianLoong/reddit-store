Btw I forgot to mention in the post, she also told me she hates the game too but she would have played anyway because it\u2019s family time.

I know families like this though... if EVERYONE doesn't participate in a given activity, the whole event (evening, wedding, weekend, vacation) is RUINED.

Something about having to sit at a table having a structured interaction (that\u2019s not productive or meaningful to me) FOR HOURS makes me want to peel my skin off.  \n\nOn the other hand, some gamers I know (including some who are ND) need that structured activity in order to comfortably interact with other people.  It\u2019s ok to not have this in common, and its nice that we can meet in the middle to do things everyone enjoys (escape room!)\n\nShame on this host for deciding that everyone must be like him and strong-arming people like a schoolyard bully.

It is ridiculous.", "NTA. Wtf. Sorry you guys had to deal with that. Fuck that guy", "I think an easy alternative here would be to play on a team with your husband. You all can play and when he's ready to take a break he can walk away. When there are questions about strategy you can decide. If he's doing well you can take a break.
