You are never going to be as heavily involved in that baby's life if your son was still in the picture.

Finally, it's rare to see court mandated supervision unless there is evidence of negligence, abuse, or potential for kidnapping to babe a few, so this leads me to believe that you're being dishonest about the visitation situation.

I'm just saying, that's not relevant to her argument, and it's deflecting.", "The refusal to answer suggests it\u2019s a lot older than 17", "My Ggod. The most ridiculous and pathetic reasoning I have ever heard. You have no idea why a relationship could be bad. But go ahead and blame the grandparents", "Yes. The disgusting and entitled ones who call everyone else disgusting and entitled", "Yeah there\u2019s many countries around the world.", "That said, (and disclaimer, I've never looked into this much. I was married before getting pregnant, so never mattered) in some states, if the parents are not married at the time of birth, the father doesn't have any rights to the child. He has to sue/petition for rights even if Mom is totally on board with dad having access to the kid. \n\nNo idea how that impacts child support though. \n\nOr if it applies here.", "\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f OP has thus far refused to answer to the age of her son. Which isn't a great look. \n\nMom is 17 now, baby is 1, so mom was 16 when baby was born. 15-16 when baby was made. Which, depending on the answer to \"how old is dad\" could very easily explain the reluctance to let OP be involved, the court monitor, and would open up the possibility of the state terminating dad's rights.", "I know people IRL who are actually that dense. It's impressive they manage to put a skirt on the correct way.", "If Amanda is 17 now, and the baby is 1, how old was she when she got pregnant?  16?

No. Were we going to go out of our way and go against what we wanted for our kids so she would see them? Also no. \n\nMy husband had many conversations with her and all she got out of it was that it was all my fault. When really, he made the decision, I didn\u2019t have nearly as much problem with what she was doing as he did. The first time he heard her say one bad thing about me to our kid, he was done and they haven\u2019t seen her since. My older 2 haven\u2019t seen her in 12 years, my younger 2 have never met her. All because she wanted things her way or no way.\n\nIf you want a relationship with your grandkids, you should build a healthy relationship with their parent. Or you don\u2019t get to see them. Period.", "Yeah I suppose there could be somewhere it is possible.", "Oh yes, same here. But that's a whole other thing though.", "Yeah and her refusal to admit it makes it seem even worse like the girls parents should have pressed charges for adult dating a minor.\n\nI mean like if he's in his late 20s or 30s with a minor.", "Possibly 14 if she got pregnant shortly before she turned 15 AND baby is closer to 2.", "Well it is lol", "Yeah, idk how it works \ud83d\ude02 never needed to know.
