Finally, it's rare to see court mandated supervision unless there is evidence of negligence, abuse, or potential for kidnapping to babe a few, so this leads me to believe that you're being dishonest about the visitation situation.

Sammie is 1, so she was 16 when she had him, so it\u2019s likely she was 15 when he got her pregnant. \n\nHe made the choice to sign over parental rights. You do not say that you assisted him in this, merely he is irresponsible. The reality is that it\u2019s not likely he could voluntarily sign away his rights. In fact, unless there was someone willing to adopt the boy right away, it would not happen as that makes the state solely responsible for the child if mom passed away. \n\nThat means that the judge ruled that parental rights be terminated involuntarily. The most common reason for that is due to rape/incest. She was 15, it\u2019s very probable that he was an adult at the time and the family decided they would go after him. I actually know of one case where the mother filed for child support, based on the ages of her and the (proven) father, he was carted to jail and a judge said \u201cyou daddy no more.\u201d\n\nHonestly, it doesn\u2019t matter if your son\u2019s parental rights were terminated for this reason or another one.

Although the one thing that does make me a *little* sympathetic to OP is that she\u2019s disabled and poor; if I had to guess from her post and my own clients that I work with, she may not be well-educated with trauma and abuse in her own past, and in our society it can be almost impossible to escape that spiral. If that\u2019s the case for her, I can see why the mother\u2019s financial privilege (free uncle lawyer) vs her own impoverished self having to pay for a lawyer is like another knife in the wound. With that said, if I were that mother, I\u2019d be keeping my kid as far from her & throwing up as many barriers as I could too.", "But supervised by a professional monitor? Supervised visits would be normal where I am from in this situation, but it would mean just that the grandparent can't take the child and visit alone, so they go to visit in the mother's home or the mother (or someone she trusts) brings the child to them or a public place for the visit.", "Yes, it is a person.", "ADA does not entitled anyone to a discount.", "My partner and I are unmarried and when we had our child, we both had to sign an Acknowledgment of Paternity under oath in the hospital after they were born in order to get his name on their birth certificate.

I\u2019m sure this varies some by state but that was the situation in my state. I\u2019m not saying it applies here, but in my experience every single person who asked about \u201cGrandparents Rights\u201d was the parent of a deadbeat parent who thought they could make wild demands because their child knocked someone up, not realizing they had zero feet to stand on.", "My guess is he is a whole grown ass man, who should know better. I'm also making an educated guess that he did not \"sign away his rights\" and it more falls into the territory of \"the court took his rights\", or he struck a deal to avoid jail time for a statutory rape. \n\nMost states won't let you sign away rights to a child unless the other parent has a significant other willing to step in to adopt the child(ren) to avoid creating \"bastardized children\", who are much more likely to end up with parents dependent on public assistance, through no fault of their own(I've been that mom, no judgement). \n\nI'm shocked OP was even given the option of visitation, and honestly a little suspicious of their telling how this went down. The child's mother is fully within her rights to want a monitor for any number of reasons. To avoid her taking photos of the child to share with the aperm donor comes to mind. To keep her from allowing her son to see the child. It probably doesn't have a lot to do with the grandmother and more to do with making sure the child is kept away from the father.", "That's what I was thinking.  This poor woman doesn't really have a grandchild, as her son no longer legally has a child.  And it would probably be in the best interest of the OP and the child if she lets this go.

They were able to do it, but my dad had the money to pay a lawyer, they already saw the kid multiple times a month so had a longstanding existing relationship, and even the mother agrees that Grandma and my dad were a good influence.  But it takes that sort of situation to flex grandparents rights, at least where they live.

Amanda\u2019s family most likely released him from all financial obligations (assuming legal financial responsibility themselves) in exchange for giving up parental rights. They want him out of the picture. \n\nThat\u2019s why OP\u2019s post doesn\u2019t make sense. If he\u2019s not the father, she\u2019s not the grandmother. Grandpatental rights are usually only granted to preserve an existing relationship. And with paid court ordered monitor? We clearly don\u2019t have the whole story here, this is a missing reasons post.", "This is very much a depends type answer. Some places yes, giving up parental rights negates the need for child support. In others it doesn\u2019t. It also depends on circumstances such as was the person actually the parent and so on, but IANAL so I could be misunderstanding what I\u2019ve read.", "You're getting some confused answers here but gonna jump in to clarify- when people say they \"sign their rights away\" versus being removed from the birth certificate can be two VERY different things. Generally, you can voluntarily give up your *rights*, but it is much harder to sign away your *obligations* to a child. So, for example, when someone usually says they signed away or lost their rights, they're giving up rights like physical custody, medical decision making, visitation, etc. Obligations like financial/child support are *much* harder to remove, so even when a parent has their rights removed due to abuse, for example, they still owe child support. \n\nRemoving someone from a birth certificate *entirely* is a whole OTHER situation. If a parent is removed from the birth certificate, they're legally not the parent with *zero* rights or obligations. When a child is adopted, for example, a new birth certificate is issued with the adoptive parent(s) listed. This is why I'm saying something much more major is going on- courts generally won't just remove a father, even if he's signed away his rights or even if he's in prison without someone else stepping up to adopt or some other strong, motivating reason why it's in the best interests of the child, especially if said child is only one year old and the mother is still a minor. Maybe they worked out a deal with the mother's parents and the court, but there's way too much missing information here.", "If he's actually OFF the birth certificate, not just gave up his parental rights? That's not his child at all. He has no more responsibility to the kid than you do. It's a pretty big statement that someone is willing to completely let him off the legal and financial hook in exchange for never seeing him again.", ">By doing this, is he still responsible financially for the well being of his child?\n\nState dependent  I believe .  My state only allows a parent to sign away rights  though a court order but the mother ( or father ) can bring up the case in court citing something like not a fit parent or not actually the parent  BUT said parent is still responsible for child support.\n\nI only have hearsay with other states where people have claimed how the other parent ( one case was the mother ) signed away rights but with the case of the mother who gave up her rights to the father , she still paid child support.  He didn't say whether it was to be nice or she still had to but it seems to me since she didn't want the child she probably had to. \n\nBut either way even if OPs son still had to pay child support it doesn't necessarily mean he IS paying child support.", "The girl is 17 and op is ignoring every question asking how old her son is, I'm assuming he's an adult and possibly in trouble for molesting her.", "This is rarely the case when you relinquish/lose rights in the US (which from context of post suggests OP is), as rights and obligations are two very different things (though commonly confused). Even when a child is removed from a home and placed into foster care, the parent(s) are not removed from the birth certificate, for example, *unless* the child is adopted. In most cases, a court will not allow a parent to be removed from the birth certificate/have obligations like child support removed, even if all other rights are waived and the other parent is willing, *unless* the court has a compelling reason that it's in the best interest to do so (eg step parent willing to adopt, maybe the mother's parents signed an agreement with court, etc). But no- this isn't standard to be removed from a birth certificate just because you waive your rights, this is why deadbeat/unwilling parents don't just get to stop paying child support.", "The way you worded it makes it sound like grandparents can never be held responsible for their grandchildren, even if their child is a deadbeat. That's not true. \n\nOP hasn't been ordered because father gave up his rights and she's too poor.

If they\u2019re unmarried, there is that assumption that the male partner could possibly not be the biological father as there is no \u201cproof\u201d outside of a DNA test, so you can\u2019t force them to take responsibility of the child. Signing the AOP, is basically a good faith agreement that both parties acknowledge paternity. They also can\u2019t sign it without the mother\u2019s consent. So if the mother doesn\u2019t sign, the father cannot sign. Even if they do sign it, they have 60 days to rescind.\n\nVirginia lol.", "Totally!

I've been trying to stay clinical in studies that include some pretty awful circumstances but that is an important callout.", "There are more details in the first article I linked. It does go on to make a similar point, that not every birth of \"19 and under mother\" and \"20 and over father\" is the same.  That's their overall thesis really. They do present some cases where if you make the criteria \"worse\" (younger mother, bigger age difference) the numbers do go down. But imo they are still pretty disgustingly high even if not a majority by those worse criteria."]}
