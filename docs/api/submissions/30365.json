Reduce everything to bare necessities only. Have enough clothes for one week. You can go switch out clothes/wash clothes over the weekend at your grandparents place. Basically make it so that the moment you\u2019re 18, you\u2019re gone with little difficulty and they can\u2019t get you. Make sure any bank accounts you actually use don\u2019t have your mom (or stepdad) on them. Also make sure the in use account(s) are at a bank neither of them use (even if they only have a credit card there) so that they don\u2019t go to a local branch and somehow convince a teller to let them have access. If you can\u2019t get your grandparents to help you open an account, and you can\u2019t get one of your own until 18, make plans to be at whichever bank you choose to use the moment they open on your 18th birthday (or 1st business day afterwards if on a weekend/bank holiday). If you miss part of the school day, accept that consequence. Your safety and wellbeing is far more important than a small blip on your school records.", "NTA \n\nWhere was your mother in this?

I can also imagine though, that you probably didn't decline your invitation with grace. You could have agreed to go to keep the peace, or you could have come up with a polite excuse for not being able to go, but I imagine you probably declined in a way that showed your true feelings - that you don't give a shit. I'm sure you knew that this would cause some amount of drama too, and sure enough, here it is! You don't need our opinions. You know if you were an asshole or not!", "This isn't OP's stepdad, she clearly only refered to him as her mom's husband.", "> I saw a meme on Facebook the other day with a book titled \"why men deserve to be in cages\"\n\n\ud83d\ude27\n\ni don't think that seems appropriate anywhere but O.K.", "Found the step dad lmao", "I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s entirely unreasonable for OP\u2019s step-father to order her to do **anything**.

This goes especially if you let someone with any kind of power to do harm to you *know* that you're leaving before you actually do.\n\nAnd it applies to any and all kinds of abusive dynamics.\n\nIf OP's stepdad & mom, as adults, and people who might have things in their name that OP relies on, find out prematurely that OP is leaving, they can do things like boot a kid out of home in the middle of the night after cutting off cell service, report a car as stolen if it's taken, remove them from car insurance & then call the cops when they'll be driving on fake drunk charges, knowing they'll pop up as an uninsured driver, remove them from med insurance knowing they have prescriptions to fill, stop providing food, etc.\n\nAnd that's before you jump to choices that more directly put vulnerable teens in danger, expose them to violence, and cut off communications with their support network.\n\nIf you can **safely** grab documents, *without arousing suspicion or tipping off abusers of your plans before you're safely out of their reach*, by all means, save yourself the money.\n\nBut in a volatile situation, that is risk calculation & management that you do not want to guess wrong on. And it is worth $35 to not have somebody break your collarbone, leave you stranded by the roadside in the snow at midnight, or any number of other far worse things.\n\nIt is never a victim or survivor's *fault* when that happens, but if it is in any way a preventable or avoidable circumstance, that degree of potential danger has a human cost greater than $35 USD."]}
