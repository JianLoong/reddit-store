She was rude first and she was clear that she didn't want you to open the door for her. You closed it and let her open it herself. FAFO", "Nope. If that's her response to a normal act of decency, then the hell with her.", "NTA. She's not entitled to be an AH and still have the door opened.", "NTA. that's why I don't hold doors anymore.", "NTA.  You closed the door bc she was very rude.  She asked if you felt she couldn't open the door bc she is a woman, so you closed it thus giving her the opportunity to open it all by herself.  I despise people who are looking for a reason to be offended.\n\nI am a 56F and I open the door for anyone coming behind me, or vice versa, especially if that person is in difficulty (I live in Florida, lots and lots of elderly people here).  On the other hand, if someone holds the door for me, I make sure to thank them.\n\nI think you did just fine.  You get out of the world what you put into it... and that woman sends out bitterness.", "You where absolutely right", "It is in fact possible to have more than one asshole in a situation.  She is an asshole for making some snotty comment and you're an asshole for closing the door on her.  People suck, but that doesn't mean you also have to suck when they do shitty things around you.  You're not THE asshole but you're AN asshole", "INFO: \n\nHow far was she from the door?", "YTA for writing such obvious bait. Try harder next time", "If this is real NTA but \u201call\u201d the girls supporting that woman seems pretty unbelievable.", "ESH. She was disrespectful. Rather than sticking to your principles of being a \"gentleman,\" you rudely shut the door in her face. You turned what initially seemed like a kindness into a tactic to put her in her place.", "NTA she said she could open it herself lol you obliged her. I respect anyone who holds the door or elevator for anyone male or female I do the same it\u2019s just curtesy she\u2019s delusional or one of those over the top feminist.", "NTA I hold the door open for anyone behind me just as a rule. I\u2019m a woman and I just think it\u2019s nice", "NTA\n\nShe asked for it.", "NTA. I routinely hold doors for people. With the exception of elevators. Those I hit the door shut button before the floor I'm going to.", "NTA\n\nYou let this rude ungrateful person open the door for themselves.", "Female as well, I was raised to hold the door open to anyone. \n\nAs I grew up I modified it that I'll hold it open if they are close behind. I'm not holding it open for a solid 2 mins for someone to feel rushed to the door. However I have waited to reopen said door when they got closer (taught when I was an usher for local theater).\n\nBut if someone got mad I held the door open and accused me of sexism? I'd straight up reply: \"Not at all, let's see you in action\" and then close the door so they can open it themselves. I depending on the day (I.e. I'm feeling petty) I might even add a \"good job\" so they feel the pleasure of a job well done.", "I was raised about the same. In my family is called manners too: hold the door open, wait by the elevator if you see someone coming...", "Same. I was taught that this is the polite thing to do, regardless of gender.", "Yep. I tend to think anyone not holding the door for someone is an AH.", "Heads up you are the top comment without a judgemeant", "This is the way", "Hold the door for anyone coming through, even when they're at that awkward distance of having to do a fake little dad run to get through quicker.\n\nA response criticising any help I offered would result in the help being removed. OP isn't in the wrong!", "This is how I was raised, and how I raise my daughters. Have respect for everyone no matter the gender. It\u2019s kinda sad how some men get excited when you hold a door for them.", "Yep, nothing to do with being a gentleman, it's just polite to hold doors for people. OP was quite right to close it. NTA", "Exactly this. The rule is that if you get to the door first and someone is coming up behind you, you hold the door for them. Especially the elderly, disabled, or people with children. And, as a woman in the south, men like to take the door from me if they see me holding it for them, so it\u2019s a win win because we both get to be polite.", "Followed by loudly saying \"you're WELCOME!\" if they don't say thank you.", "There's a difference though between a door pass and standing in front of the door and letting someone go before you. When someone does the latter to me, I am annoyed. Door passes are always cool though", "Exactly, she was rude. Justified AH.", "I like feminists like you.", "> unless you put on a John Wayne voice and say, \"let me get that for you, little lady.\"\n\nActually, done well, I think that could be delightfully amusing.", "I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.. thank you for your response.", "That is why I said nothin in response and left.", "I didn\u2019t want to be disrespectful which is why I left without a word.", "I\u2019ll continue you have my word. Thank you for your response.", "That is interesting, please forward that to me if you ever find. Thank you for your response.", "Thank you for your input, I do find this insightful.", "Not far, within 5ft by the time I got to the door before her.", "Yep gentleman comment bothered me too. It is a very ugly word", "Oh I'm really bad at actually saying if they are the arsehole or not!", "Why are you annoyed?", "You\u2019d be damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.", "NTA. \n\nI only ask because more than once I've been on the receiving end of a \"chivalrous\" dude who held open a door for more than 30 seconds while I came by, then instantly got mad I wasn't fawning over them in thanks. Not that I assume that of you! But it happens.", "That's kinda adorable though ngl", "Oooooh okay lol.\n\nSounds good.", "Its just annoying when they are staring me down and walk behind me. A simple door pass is alot less intimate.", "I can totally understand your situation. To be honest,  30 seconds is excessive. Growing up I would always hold the door open out of courtesy sometimes without even realize I\u2019m doing it. So on this day as I was leaving I just figured this was nothing different. Clearly I was wrong and I\u2019m oppressing women by holding the door open. I have never experienced this before so the shock of it all resulted in my reaction. No love lost though.", "Nah. Don't take it to heart. She's probably mad about something else."]}
