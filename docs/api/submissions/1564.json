Thus entering before her.", "Isn\u2019t this a curb your enthusiasm episode?", "Fuck her", "NTA, holding doors open is a courtesy, not a privilege or right.", "You did what she asked for.", "As a woman who lives in the south where men opening the is common you are NTA!", "NTA, you were being courteous.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t the 50\u2019s and people of all sexes hold doors open for each other. Or they don\u2019t, which is ok too. It\u2019s presumptive that she decided why you held her door open. Feel free to close doors on people like that.", "NTA. I am a 60 year old woman and I hold doors open for other people.That lady got what she deserved.", "NTA. I'm a 63f, and if I reach the door first, I hold (or pass along the now open door) to my next fellow human being. In my southern US state, we do this all this time, age and gender do not matter. Just kindness and politeness. Young guys hold the door for me, I (limping along on a crutch for 1.5 yrs) hold/pass along doors to **both** young/old men or young/old women. Lately I've noticed that women within a 15 yr age range just light up with a smile and a thank you, and I do the same, whenever I receive this courtesy! In my younger yrs, this was mostly a male to female courtesy. Now, it's common decency, (especially as today's doors are so heavy), to hold or pass along. I don't fault you for your response. You acted with good manners and probably would have done the same for an older gentleman, or anyone else? She was very rude, so let her open her own door, if she's so offended. Come visit SC or NC, folks in our area will value you, not treat you rudely.", "NTA, seems like the girl was looking for something to get mad at. You did the right thing, don't let people like that try to pull you into their BS, especially if you showed them nothing but kindness.", "ETA. She was an asshole and you responded by being an asshole. Tit for Tat, but y'all are assholes.", "Yup, sounds totally real.", "It seems like ESH, but I kinda need more information.\n\nIf she was just behind you or someone you know and you opened the door for her and she was a jerk about it then she's in the wrong ... but that doesn't excuse you closing the door on her. That's a bit of a borderline reaction.\n\nIf you were being a bit weird about it eg you waited a huge amount of time for her to get there or opened the door with a flourish or were behaving egotistical - and the comment about you considering yourself a gentleman kinda suggests to me that this might be what set her off then she's not entirely excused for commenting, but I wouldn't blame her for being weirded out.\n\nUltimately, your reaction was shitty. In no reading of this are you not an asshole, it's just a question of whether or not you're the only asshole. It's fine to hold the door for someone, but if you think you're \"teaching someone a lesson\" and close the door on them when you don't find them sufficiently grateful, then you're an asshole.", "I hold doors for whoever is there too!", "THIS RIGHT HERE. I'm a woman and I hold open doors for everyone. And I've seen plenty of women and girls do this also. So not sure why this lady needed to have such an attitude. A simple thank you would've been sufficient. NTA.", "This is the way.", "As a woman, i'm with you 100% on this", "When I hold the door and someone says thanks and I say no problem, and vice versa, I feel we both feel good about it. There is just something about being polite to one another that brightens your day.\n\nOne day while leaving a store my daughter was the last one out and let the door close. Someone approaching was at least 6 steps away, she ran back and opened the door, apologizing to the guy walking up. He thanked her, she said your welcome, both with big smiles. She didn't need to do it, but it made them both happy, and it made me smile seeing how polite she was. My son has done similar and it's just nice to see people reciprocating politeness.", "Exactly!", "I just stop and stare at them at this point in my life, waiting for them to fucking move. They get real mad! But I'm not going to voluntarily give up my personal space because they are, *best* case scenario, too goddamn stupid to understand how going through a door works even when confronted with a visual demonstration they're a part of. So I just make it real awkward for them instead.", "THIS RIGHT HERE IN A NUTSHELL\u2026 I\u2019m usually very helpful when I see women struggling with something heavy for example. Now I hesitate every time fearing false accusations or being told off for being a creep or something to those effects. I never talked to anyone about this simply because I feel no one really cares how men feel in society. We\u2019re just tools that no one checks on after being used.", "Thank you for this insight.", "Agreed", "It's not even that they didnt react the way OP wanted. It's that the woman was incredibly rude, and went over the line. He was doing something polite and this woman decided that his action of just holding a door open was sexist for some reason. Which is total bs.", "Thank you for your comment.", "What a weird comment. OP, you're NTA.", "She was approximately 5ft from the door when I got to it before she did. So opened it and held it open for her. Also, my reaction took me by surprise, I appreciate your input so thank you.", "In all my 35 years of life, the only time I've been called a misogynist was for opening a door. We would have hit the door at the exact same time which is always awkward  so I sped up a step. I got a \"You're a misogynistic asshole\" for that. In retrospect I'd do it again because social anxiety says that's a less awkward encounter than the who grabs door first game...", "Ehh it was a while ago, but you got to remember that some people are just going to be unhappy with your actions no matter what you do. In the end their opinions usually don't mean jack shit.", "She\u2019s not, because it isn\u2019t real. People don\u2019t behave this way in real life.", "Nah, he inserted himself in someone else\u2019s life and expected gratitude for a very easy task she would have done for herself.", "And that would have been a fantastic reply from OP, \"I held the door open because you are a person\"! Now closing the door in her face is getting closer to ESH I think. She was rude first, and OP did reciprocated.", "Exactly. Also always put the lid down. That means the seat will be down, but everyone has to raise the lid.", "I'm a lady who went to grad school at a conservative Texas university. I'll hold the door for anyone nearby, but I'd have guys take the door from me, and then try to usher me inside/outside, so *they* could hold the door for *me.* It was...odd.", "I don\u2019t know where you live, but you\u2019d consider me an elderly man, and where I live you holding the door for me, or me for you, whomever got there first, would just be routine.", "I've never once seen someone get called a misogynist for opening a door. I've had dozens of interactions where a door gets opened for me and as soon as I say thank you he takes that as an invitation to say something incredibly misogynistic.", "Totally not relevant, but this made me think of something that happened once. Both my husband and son are fabulous at putting the seat down and I never had to ask my son, except the one time I explained (I mean boys/men have to sit sometimes too). Anyway I am still not sure who forgot, my kiddo or husband, in the middle of the night delirium. Shoot I was delirious and haven't checked in my own house for years. Imagine my surprise when I fall into the toilet around 3 am. I screamed. Kiddo woke up and is all \"what! What? What is wrong? Are you okay?\" Yes child. My ass is just really wet now. Ugh.", "I\u2019m from Texas and it is a pretty normal thing for men to do here.", "For me that always happens with those doors that have a little \"airlock\" (like they have at grocery stores), one of us holds the first door, and the other holds the next. It's a strange yet seemingly universal unsaid rule.", "I\u2019m from Georgia, and that is very normal here. I always hold doors for people, but men constantly grab the door and hold usher me inside", "Wow. Just, wow.", "Well, now you've \"met\" an internet rando who it happened to. There were no words spoken (social anxiety says stranger danger) or ogling done prior to it. I just think some women hate all men. There are men that hate women so it stands to reason the reverse can be so. Shrug.", "Once when my son was 5 he woke up, walked into the kitchen, and peed into the garbage can. He was sound asleep. (Sleepwalking.) Wasn't an issue as he got older, but I'll never forget it. :)", "It's not like I'm present at every doorway to watch, I wasn't trying to imply it didn't happen. Just offer the perspective that all chances to meet new people might involve dealing with an AH. But since you've brought it up I promise you that the number of women who have just had enough guys be shitty about the door thing to the point that they are also just shitty with everyone now, is much higher than the number that just irrationally hate all men.", "Very impressive he peed in a garbage can while sleepwalking instead of some random corner \ud83e\udd23 memories are priceless!", "I fully expect that to be the case. Had I given her a once over or literally said anything at all, then I'd expect that reaction. The fact that there was nothing else at all is what led me to label as hating rather than just tired of that shit. My wife was *entirely* too amused at my stupefied face when I got home from the store that trip...lol", "It makes a bit more sense if you understand our house. He passed out on the couch in the living room, directly under his room. The bathroom is directly over the kitchen. The path he took was exactly the path he would take upstairs.\n\nAt least, that's how I rationalize it. He's 18 now and can't remember a thing.", "That does sound bizarre. The only thing I can guess is that maybe she felt like she was closer to the door and you'd run to take it off her? Idk, maybe it was just the world's shittiest day and she walked away like \"Why did I say that?\"\n\nI also want to know what goes through the mind of a guy who opens the door for a stranger and decides that's a good time to tell her \"if you wanted to thank me should have put your makeup on this morning\" AH's man, they just... *sigh* nout as queer as folk", "Definitely makes a lot of sense! I'm still impressed though!", "I wish it was legal to pepper spray people for doing/saying stupid things (not qualifying my example under this). Spray bottle works for (most) cats...same principle, right?"]}
