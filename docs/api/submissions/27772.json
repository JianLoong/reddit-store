I have my two daughters (16 and 11) week about with my ex wife \"anna\" (46f), and Lauren has a daughter from her prior relationship (deceased ex due to a car accident while lauren was pregnant) who is 5.\n\nAnna and I split 5 years ago when Anna realised she was bi and wanted to pursue a woman from her work, I will admit that I probably moved on with Lauren too fast due to my devastation over my 21yr relationship ending and lauren still being in grief from the loss of her husband plus struggling with a (at the time) very sick newborn. However for the most part we have all been able to remain amicable and we all went to Anna's marriage to her coworker Lin about 6 months the ago. \n\nOriginally the plan re my wedding to Lauren was for all of us to travel to the destination together so that my eldest could be a bridesmaid, and our younger two could be flower girls. \n\nHowever Anna and Lin have recently broken up and Anna has asked us to postpone our wedding out of respect to her, when I tried to explain that this is impossible as it would cost us a lot to do so she flew off the handle and accused me of deliberately hurting her, cheating on her with lauren (not true tho there was only a couple months between our split and meeting lauren), leaving her for a younger woman, called lauren a gold digger and threatened to ruin our wedding. I hung up on her and sent her an email uninviting her from our wedding due to her threat. She now says she is revoking consent to our daughters participation- I don't think this is fair on them and I don't want them to feel left out so I merely pointed out that the wedding is on my week and she doesn't get a say. AITA if I ignore her wishes?\n\nEdited to add: there was an incident with a trip to NZ a bit over a year ago where Anna tried to stop the trip (she thought we were showing off our financial state/we were visiting Lauren's former inlaws so they could see her daughter/their granddaughter for the first time since covid) and we ended up having to involve lawyers so there is a precedent for me being able to take the girls overseas without Anna's permission so long as it doesn't affect her time with them.", "created_utc": 1695874955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16u67ui/aita_for_ignoring_my_exwifes_wishes_regarding/", "score": 2969, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Def double check so you can get your ducks in a row if this goes to court. Also be prepared for your ex to try and take you to court over this.

I feel for Anna; it would be hard to be a part of your ex's wedding while your current relationship falls apart. However, obviously her asking you to postpone it is wildly absurd. And out of \"respect?\" (Let's be serious, it would be out of pity at best.) What's disrespectful is ruining someone else's wedding because you're having a tough time. Honestly, I don't understand how some people can expect the things they expect and don't hear the complete entitlement and audacity exiting their mouths - major main character syndrome. \n\nI say show up at her place with a bottle of wine and be there for her heartbreak and give her a chance to sort her shit out and realize she's being a complete ass. If this behavior is especially out of character for her, she can probably be reasoned with... but if she still expects you to cancel your freaking wedding and/or forgo having your own children be present, she needs to know she's opening a giant GIANT long-term can of worms - does she really want to fight with you for the next... ever? Because that's clearly what she would be signing up for if she ruins your wedding.\n\nOh and NTA, at all, obviously.\n\nEdit - are the downvotes because I empathized with Anna or because the wine is a bad idea or something else?

You're ignoring your ex-wife's feelings during a difficult time for her, and you uninvited her after she reacted emotionally.
