I have my two daughters (16 and 11) week about with my ex wife \"anna\" (46f), and Lauren has a daughter from her prior relationship (deceased ex due to a car accident while lauren was pregnant) who is 5.\n\nAnna and I split 5 years ago when Anna realised she was bi and wanted to pursue a woman from her work, I will admit that I probably moved on with Lauren too fast due to my devastation over my 21yr relationship ending and lauren still being in grief from the loss of her husband plus struggling with a (at the time) very sick newborn. However for the most part we have all been able to remain amicable and we all went to Anna's marriage to her coworker Lin about 6 months the ago. \n\nOriginally the plan re my wedding to Lauren was for all of us to travel to the destination together so that my eldest could be a bridesmaid, and our younger two could be flower girls. \n\nHowever Anna and Lin have recently broken up and Anna has asked us to postpone our wedding out of respect to her, when I tried to explain that this is impossible as it would cost us a lot to do so she flew off the handle and accused me of deliberately hurting her, cheating on her with lauren (not true tho there was only a couple months between our split and meeting lauren), leaving her for a younger woman, called lauren a gold digger and threatened to ruin our wedding. I hung up on her and sent her an email uninviting her from our wedding due to her threat. She now says she is revoking consent to our daughters participation- I don't think this is fair on them and I don't want them to feel left out so I merely pointed out that the wedding is on my week and she doesn't get a say. AITA if I ignore her wishes?\n\nEdited to add: there was an incident with a trip to NZ a bit over a year ago where Anna tried to stop the trip (she thought we were showing off our financial state/we were visiting Lauren's former inlaws so they could see her daughter/their granddaughter for the first time since covid) and we ended up having to involve lawyers so there is a precedent for me being able to take the girls overseas without Anna's permission so long as it doesn't affect her time with them.", "created_utc": 1695874955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16u67ui/aita_for_ignoring_my_exwifes_wishes_regarding/", "score": 516, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel for Anna; it would be hard to be a part of your ex's wedding while your current relationship falls apart. However, obviously her asking you to postpone it is wildly absurd. And out of \"respect?\" (Let's be serious, it would be out of pity at best.) What's disrespectful is ruining someone else's wedding because you're having a tough time. Honestly, I don't understand how some people can expect the things they expect and don't hear the complete entitlement and audacity exiting their mouths - major main character syndrome. \n\nI say show up at her place with a bottle of wine and be there for her heartbreak and give her a chance to sort her shit out and realize she's being a complete ass. If this behavior is especially out of character for her, she can probably be reasoned with... but if she still expects you to cancel your freaking wedding and/or forgo having your own children be present, she needs to know she's opening a giant GIANT long-term can of worms - does she really want to fight with you for the next... ever? Because that's clearly what she would be signing up for if she ruins your wedding.\n\nOh and NTA, at all, obviously.\n\nEdit - are the downvotes because I empathized with Anna or because the wine is a bad idea or something else?

You're ignoring your ex-wife's feelings during a difficult time for her, and you uninvited her after she reacted emotionally.

Because there\u2019s a big difference between taking your kids to another state and taking then overseas.", "Show up to the airport extra early just in case there are issues.", "Abduction is planning not to come back.  This is a vacation with round trip tickets. She previously gave permission. \nThere's no parental abduction here.", "Yeah, it is *not* a reasonable request. You don't get to demand people put their lives and relationships on hold because you're sad - I can't even wrap my brain around someone thinking that's an appropriate ask. Hopefully she'll snap out of it and realize how unreasonable she's being due to grief.", "Yeah, good point ... I guess I was hoping that since they were all getting along for a while, she might be more reasonable than she is currently being... then again the audacity level of her request suggests a major disconnect from reality and a pretty massive sense of self-importance, so you're probably right.", "She is bitter at ops happiness since her relationship just ended", "How is it OP's fault that she is single and dating when she just broke up her new marriage (she was married 6 months ago)?", "I know. But do you think real child abductors will tell customs they are not coming back? Of course not. So customs will not take it lightly if you travel with a child and not both parents are available and there is also not a written form of consent. This is to prevent child abductions. So they will sort out everything and make phone calls to mom and if she says no at that moment to cross her exes plans then there is a possibility customs will not let you take these children out of the country. They do this to prevent the real child abductions. \n\nI know they will not take it lightly because my husband and I travel with his son/ my stepson once in a while. When we travel across any boarder we have to have forms ready. We are always planning on coming back and the mother of my stepson knows and we have a good relationship so there are no problems and we have everything ready as well. But as I read in OPs story the ex does not want this wedding to happen so she might do things like preventing the children to leave.", "I can see your point (and I didn't downvote btw), but you're thinking like a normal person, and many of the cases we have here are fake and the characters caricatures anyway. And when it's not fake, it's still some weird extreme.", "It wouldn't be the first time a spouse blew up their marriage for grass that's greener on the other side only for that grass to die and the ex to realise they gave up a good thing for a little fling.", "I love how - after the relationship ended - suddenly OP is the one that cheated and left her for a younger woman....", "Please point out where they said it was OPs fault"]}
