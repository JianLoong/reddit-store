{"id": 19, "submission_id": "yiu5mw", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend that I won't covert to his religion?", "selftext": "I'm agnostic and believe in East Asian spirituality to a degree. I was never raised in a religion or belief in a higher power.\n\n\nMy boyfriend however is Christian. I don't remember which kind or what type I just know he believes in Jesus and God. He didn't seem like a particularly religious person and he said he doesn't really celebrate the holidays or partake in Christian traditions so I didn't mind his religion when we first got together.\n\n\nBut I did tell him that I wasn't going to convert to Christianity. It not only went against what I was taught and what I believed in already, converting would greatly upset my family and I would get so much shit from them for the rest of my life. Likewise, I said I wasn't going to convert him to believe in my beliefs unless he wanted to.\u00a0\n\n\nHe agreed that he would respect my beliefs but stated he would like me to convert. Which is understandable, I feel the same way. However, something felt wrong when he said he would still try to convert me anyway. I shrugged it off as a joke as he's the type to joke about these things.\u00a0\n\n\nToday, the two of us were talking and somehow got into a conversation about religion again. I said something to the extent of 'would you prefer to have a priest officiate our wedding.' He said yes. I told him that while we could have a priest, I'm not Christian and my side of the family would freak out if we did. So he joked about waiting till I converted to get married.\n\n\nThat made me uncomfortable? Unsafe? I can't pinpoint the exact emotions but my heart sank at the notion.\u00a0\n\n\nI told him again that I don't want to be converted. He responded that he wasn't going to actively try to convert me. I clarified that I didn't want to be converted at all ever.\u00a0\n\n\nI asked him if there was anything that would stop you from converting me. He said no, with no exceptions. He doesn't care how long it takes but he wants to convert me.\n\n\nSo I told him directly that I felt like he didn't understand where I was coming from and that he wasn't respecting my opinions. It felt like a breach of trust and that there was an undertone of manipulation in this relationship. He sounded annoyed when he said he thought I was overreacting.\u00a0\n\n\nI tried to explain to him how invasive it felt to always be pressured to convert to his religion when I don't want to. He got angry and told me that I didn't understand where he was coming from. That in his religion, he is supposed to convert others into believing in God and that he is able to respect my beliefs while trying to change them at the same time. I'm making him out to be the bad guy, he said.\u00a0\n\n\nWe haven't spoken since.\u00a0\n\n\nI fear that I angered him too much. I wanted to set my boundaries but it feels like I offended him greatly.\u00a0\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nUPDATE: I'm about to get down voted into oblivion. \n\nFirst off, I very much appreciate everyone from responding and giving advice. It's easy to summarize the general opinion of the comment section. \"NTA, Leave Him\"\n\nTo the disappointment to pretty much everyone who reads this post, no I will not be breaking up with him.\n\nBefore you all start telling me how much of a bad idea it is to stay with him and that he's abusive, let me do some explaining.\n\nI wrote this post right after we argued so I can safely say that the narrative of this post is skewed in my favor. Yes, he did say that he wanted me to convert at some point. But everything else he said that was written is more aggressively because of my emotions at the time. For that, I'm sorry for deceiving you all.\n\nI'm meek by nature. English is my second language and I was half raised in East Asia. I've been abused for a good chunk of my life. All that is to say I'm not confrontational. I struggle with explaning myself and I give people more chances then they should as I've been conditioned to be like this (Im getting help for it). As I wrote in the comment section, I wanted to give my boyfriend another chance as I really wanted him to understand my points properly without being emotionally charged. \n\nSo I did talk to him about it. After a while of discussion (and crying on my part), we did reach a consensus. He apologized for pressuring me so much to convert and that he didn't mean to hurt me with his jokes. He also apologized for being so dismissive of my boundaries. He still doesn't completely understand why I don't want to convert but he promised that he wouldn't try to convert me ever unless I wanted to.\n\nWe also talked about our future a lot. I won't write down all the details for privacy reasons, but we clarified a lot of issues and I'm happy with the final decisions.There are still a few little problems that could be addressed but it's late for us and we need sleep lol.\n\nOne major thing to address, no my boyfriend is not apart of any extremists churches. He's not a religious nutcase or think he's the righteous hand of God. I found it very humorous reading all the comments about him being this insane Christian man that has no respect for me when in reality, he just didn't understand what he was doing wrong until I sat him down and slowly explained it to him. That doesn't make him a bad person. At least, I don't think so. \n\nThank you all again for your help and have a good morning/afternoon/evening.", "created_utc": 1667263739, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiu5mw/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_i_wont_covert/", "score": 437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Long after I wised up and moved on, I found videos on his social media featuring his converted wife (same background as me, actually knew her family) giving speeches at youth camps about how jesus saved her through him from the evil non-Christian community she had been raised in.

Honestly, even if he says that he is okay not raising a child with his beliefs, do you truly believe that he wouldn't go behind your back?", "He doesn't understand why you don't want to convert?\n\nWell how much does he like the idea of converting to your \"religion\"? \n\nHe sounds creepy and I know you talked things through. But he still thinks he can change your opinion. He doesn't accept your boundaries and thinks that his religion is superior to yours. \nHe's making nice now but I think that he already showed his true colours when he became so very pushy. \n\nI felt uncomfortable for you just by reading this. \n\nBe safe. He sounds like a manipulative nutjob.", "Ah, the boundary ignoring, followed by the fighting, followed by the love bombing so you'll laugh at everyone who says \"get out\", followed by more boundary crossing now that your have to go back to people for advice word now say \"girl, we TOLD you\", followed by slow and subtle erosion of those barriers, etc etc, forever and ever, amen. \n\nI mean, good luck.\n\n-ex Christian for a zillion good reasons, a big one being the amount of them like this guy", ">I said something to the extent of 'would you prefer to have a priest officiate our wedding.' He said yes. I told him that while we could have a priest, I'm not Christian and my side of the family would freak out if we did. So he joked about waiting till I converted to get married.\n\nThis was already an asshole territory. Even catholic church allows to marry non catholics / non christians, with some minor accommodations and some church bureaucracy, but there is no need to convert to get married. What kind of chirch is he in?\n\n>I asked him if there was anything that would stop you from converting me. He said no, with no exceptions. He doesn't care how long it takes but he wants to convert me.\n\nBelieve him now. This is his \"mission\". He would even pretend, not to wanting to convert you any longer just to restart it after.

Pushing the issue is not respectful.\n\nBut those are minor sticking points to the overall picture.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2026may?\u2026 have a handle on this situation so this may be moot. But my two cents anyway: NTA. \n\nI\u2019m agnostic myself, raised Catholic. Don\u2019t ever let anyone try to convert you to something like a religion under duress or because of a romantic relationship. Converting to a religion and deciding to practice it is supposed to be a soul searching process, not something to do just to appease someone. That would be so dumb and hollow. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this gobbledygook, I\u2019m just doing it cause I love him and he\u2019s making me?\u201d So so gross of him to put you in that situation.", "NTA.

Surely that's enough of an answer?", ">After a while of discussion (and crying on my part), we did reach a consensus. He apologized for pressuring me so much to convert and that he didn't mean to hurt me with his jokes. He also apologized for being so dismissive of my boundaries.

An unfortunate circumstance.", "NAH. You're both sticking to your principles. And you both need to accept that your relationship isn't viable long term. \n\nI'm really surprised that he insists that he wants to convert you when he doesn't actually practice his religion, but whatever.

I was never raised in a religion or belief in a higher power.\n\n\nMy boyfriend however is Christian. I don't remember which kind or what type I just know he believes in Jesus and God. He didn't seem like a particularly religious person and he said he doesn't really celebrate the holidays or partake in Christian traditions so I didn't mind his religion when we first got together.\n\n\nBut I did tell him that I wasn't going to convert to Christianity. It not only went against what I was taught and what I believed in already, converting would greatly upset my family and I would get so much shit from them for the rest of my life. Likewise, I said I wasn't going to convert him to believe in my beliefs unless he wanted to.\u00a0\n\n\nHe agreed that he would respect my beliefs but stated he would like me to convert. Which is understandable, I feel the same way. However, something felt wrong when he said he would still try to convert me anyway. I shrugged it off as a joke as he's the type to joke about these things.\u00a0\n\n\nToday, the two of us were talking and somehow got into a conversation about religion again. I said something to the extent of 'would you prefer to have a priest officiate our wedding.' He said yes. I told him that while we could have a priest, I'm not Christian and my side of the family would freak out if we did. So he joked about waiting till I converted to get married.\n\n\nThat made me uncomfortable? Unsafe? I can't pinpoint the exact emotions but my heart sank at the notion.\u00a0\n\n\nI told him again that I don't want to be converted. He responded that he wasn't going to actively try to convert me. I clarified that I didn't want to be converted at all ever.\u00a0\n\n\nI asked him if there was anything that would stop you from converting me. He said no, with no exceptions. He doesn't care how long it takes but he wants to convert me.\n\n\nSo I told him directly that I felt like he didn't understand where I was coming from and that he wasn't respecting my opinions. It felt like a breach of trust and that there was an undertone of manipulation in this relationship. He sounded annoyed when he said he thought I was overreacting.\u00a0\n\n\nI tried to explain to him how invasive it felt to always be pressured to convert to his religion when I don't want to. He got angry and told me that I didn't understand where he was coming from. That in his religion, he is supposed to convert others into believing in God and that he is able to respect my beliefs while trying to change them at the same time. I'm making him out to be the bad guy, he said.\u00a0\n\n\nWe haven't spoken since.\u00a0\n\n\nI fear that I angered him too much. I wanted to set my boundaries but it feels like I offended him greatly.\u00a0\n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sadly, he probably still thinks you're wrong to have a different belief system to his own and that he is right to try and change that, he's just planning to keep quiet on the subject for now.  \n\nThe only reason why he 'can't understand' is because he thinks there's something *wrong* with not following *his* belief system specifically.

So it might be coming out in the form of a joke, but I'm sure that he's heard it many times from people who are religous authorities in his life and are not joking, and it's obviously seeped into his subconsious. \n\nIf you want to have a happy life with him, I strongly suggest you delve into this fully from his point of view, and examine whether he is *afraid* to marry you until/unless you're converted, or if he simply wants it due to social pressures or something similar. \n\nBecause if he is actually worried about the state of his (or your) soul and/or his standing in the church, this issue will never resolve itself fully until you address it head on. That kind of belief system runs realllly deep in ones psyche, even if he's not an extremist if any kind, and doesn't just go away because he's trying to accomodate your thoughts on the matter. Not to belabor the point, but given your edits that he's not an extremist -- I can't emphasize enough how much this mentality applies to a lot of mainstream Christian churches, not just outliers or religious fanatics, so please do not assume this doesn't apply because he seems otherwise pretty casual about his religion. \n\nIf you reach an understanding after all of this, I would also get him to swear that he will literally never speak those words again, not even decades from now, not even as a joke, not ever, because like I said, it's probably lodged deep in him and might be hard to keep buried forever even if he wants it to be. And then don't tolerate it if he ever does say it again, since this kind of thing can increase & wear you down over the years in ways you won't believe.\n\nMostly, if he says he doesn't understand why you don't want to convert, it means he doesn't fully understand the difference between the two sets of beliefs, and/or that you do actually have one. (More likely, he thinks he has a set of beliefs and you don't, as if you are simply lacking the thing that he has - which opens the door to hoping you'll change your mind one day once you see what you're \"lacking\"). \n\nSo I suggest you ask him why HE doesn't want to convert to *your* belief system of agnosticism, and I have a feeling he'll suddenly understand that there's a big difference really quickly, and that being pressured into changing it is a big deal.", "NTA\n\nI would very strongly encourage you to get couple's counselling.

I\u2019ve been in your bf\u2019s position before so I kinda know where he\u2019s coming from.

While there are marriage ceremonies that are non religious, Christian marriages are officiated by a priest or pastor, and can only be done if both in the couple are Christian (at least for the churches I\u2019m familiar with). Which is not to say that we don\u2019t tolerate marriage with non-Christians. It just means that most churches won\u2019t marry a couple if one of them isn\u2019t Christian.

I suspect a huge part of that desire for religion will coincidentally line up with whenever his religion is telling you to do what he says, act how he wants you to act, and \u201csubmit\u201d to his will like a good Christian wife. Christianity subjugates women in all branches, it only varies by severity based on which sect you adhere to, and it sounds like your bf\u2019s sect is one of the more serious ones. \n\nAsk yourself why your boyfriend, who has never really cared about religion, never really been religious, never actively practiced any Christian beliefs, is dead set on converting you to \u201chis\u201d religion. It surely is not a coincidence that his religion (which would have kept him from doing fun things as a single man) happily gives him all the authority and power in a marriage. Why is it that *now* that it would require zero sacrifice from him, and he has everything to gain, he\u2019s interested in converting you? I\u2019m certain if you had converted early in your relationship and abstained from sexual relations before marriage he wouldn\u2019t have been a fan\u2026", "Give him a chance to what ?? \n\n Wear you down by manipulation??\n\nYou know that\u2019s how abusers work, right ???", "I know this seems scary and hurtful to you now, but please be strong and get out of this relationship. I was married to this guy. He\u2019s dead now, and my adult children are still emotionally impacted by his confusing manipulation. Very loving but always with a soft, shaming hook to pull them into converting. If you think it\u2019s hard for you now, think about the guilt and expectations he would put on your precious children. For agnostics or spiritual beings that don\u2019t want to be controlled by their biblical Jes\u00fas fantasies, these are very damaging people.  Save yourself and those you love a lot of pain down the road.", "Oh yeah he chose you well", "Yeah, this one is doomed.\n\nYTA to yourself.", "You can have a lot of great things in a relationship but if there are deal breakers (ie one person wants to be child free and the other wants a house full of kids.   OR.  Major differences in religious views and how to incorporate that in future child raising. OR.  How you deal with finances. ) or if you are going in different directions in life then sometime the relationship just has to come to a natural end.  It sucks.  It\u2019s hurts and it\u2019s hard. \n\nI hope you can assess what you really want out of a partner long term and see if your bf is really that.  Maybe he is.  Maybe he waving some major red flags.   Only you can decide that for you.", "He wanted it to be a church wedding so they definitely had to follow all the church's rules. They could still have gotten a civil marriage without all that if he'd been willing, but he wanted a full catholic wedding. My other sister made it accidentally scandalous and it was hilarious", "Oops! Gotta love a good family story- gets better and better as the years and retelling go by", "Yeah it's extra funny now since the marriage is over.\n\nTo save us sister bridesmaids money, sister getting married finds a Chinese website we can order bridesmaids dresses from for a lot cheaper than buying in store. So we sent in our measurements and ordered with plenty of time until the wedding. \n\nMy dress arrives and it's not quite right. We agreed on knee length and the measurements I sent reflected that, but this is a few inches short. The company really did not want to fix it and there was a lot of back and forth, but eventually they remade it mostly free, in time for the wedding. \n\nI told everyone all about this as it was happening, and our youngest sister tried her dress on and verified everything was fine on hers. But our oldest sister, the maid of honor, did not bother. To try on her dress. Before the wedding. I still don't know if she just thought it would be fine, or didn't care, or what. \n\nIt was not fine. Hemline was easily halfway up her thigh. She still wore the dress. As the maid of honor. In a Catholic wedding.", "Girl, he is gaslighting you.", "NTA I honestly absolutely hate Christian\u2019s that believe it\u2019s their right to convert anyone. It\u2019s not their business. Religion is supposed to be a very personal thing and the way Christian\u2019s act it\u2019s either their way or no way. Hold your ground and dump.", "Your update felt like such a good summary for this subreddit.\n\nWhat the fuck are we doing, listening to one-sided stories written in anger so we can judge over people we have never met before? What a waste of time.", "YTA to yourself and dismissing the obvious red flags. Via your edit: Who\u2019s to say he isn\u2019t just telling you what you want to hear so that once y\u2019all get married, he will reveal his true motives and has already trapped you, especially if y\u2019all have kids. This relationship is  doomed.", "Will be waiting for future update when you have children good luck OP.", "A lot of Christians are taught that it is our duty to \u201csave\u201d people so maybe he is just na\u00efve thinking she would not have a problem converting. But OP is definitely NTA for not wanting to. I forget which pope it was, probably JP II, but his bff was Jewish. They each respected the other\u2019s faith and that was part of their strong bond. I always thought that was such a great thing.", "He holds a world view where he genuinely believes not converting you means you suffer eternal torment.\n\nNot condoning or agreeing with those views, but he would be kind of an asshole if he didn't keep trying. That also doesn't undermine your feelings on the situation.\n\nNo assholes here, he is going to keep trying though.", "Given your update, NAH and good on you for such an emotionally mature response. I wish you much happiness together. \n\nSigned, a happily married agnostic with a Christian husband (together 12 years).", "She\u2019s staying with him. This won\u2019t end well", "Yup.  I could tell by her responses.  I feel bad for their future children.", "It's ridiculous that he 'doesn't understand why she doesn't want to be converted' - how would he feel if she wanted *him* to convert!!?? He has a deep seeded arrogance and a concerning lack of empathy.", "I'm no Christ anymore, but raised lutherisch. I do remember this stuff and it was one of the reason I do not go to church anymore", "It's your life and I wish you the very best, but do consider that children are very high stakes when it comes to Christians who believe their purpose is to convert others. And that it will be too late to realize you were wrong when you've already given birth.\n\nPoint is, I really hope you're right about him agreeing your views with regards to what religion your children will be raised under (or otherwise).", "It\u2019s crazy - you sign a piece of paper saying you will raise then as warriors of god. I didn\u2019t particularly want to and I was the one raised Catholic- my husband didn\u2019t care. He said a fake promise to the wind isn\u2019t binding ."]}
