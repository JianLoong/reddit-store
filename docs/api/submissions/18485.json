Your job is to do your best to protect your son to the best of your knowledge. It's all any parent can do.\n\nAgain, the caseworker sounds completely out of line. Is there some sort of ethics board?", "NTA.  The case worker is biased in favor of bio dad.

The bio father should be happy he is with a family that loves him and a better future than he could ever offer him.", "NTA. Suggestion: If bio dad wants to be involved in his bio son's life, he should start writing letters or filling out a journal with things he wants him to know and would like to say to him. This will give bio dad a bit of an outlet if not getting to see his bio son is truly causing him some kind of stress. Give it to your son once he's graduated high school, and allow him to make the choice himself if he'd like to have his bio dad involved in his life. I'd give it to him a few days after his graduation date so it doesn't rain on the celebration and all if he takes it badly. I wouldn't say allow contact the minute he turns 18, because I don't know where he'll be academically during that time, but it's likely he'll be finishing up high school and trying to get into a good university, which is already stressful enough. It's understandable that you'd be wary about allowing him into your son's life, especially since he's freshly out of prison. Maybe consider revisiting the idea in two years if bio dad has managed to maintain sobriety and a crime-free life. Set up a meeting for you and your wife to talk with bio dad.

Suddenly, these nice girls who got into great high schools started trying to build 'street cred.' Apparently he was seeing them and filling their heads with stories of what he considered his glory days, and of course was back to street crime.

Maybe you can handle it like a sperm donation. So he would be allowed to meet his sperm donor when he is 14 years old (depending where you are from maybe at 16 or 18). He is no father, but he is a genetic relative from your son. If possible don't keep it a secret from Adam, as it could affect your relationship if he has some puperty relatiat disputes with you and might learn exactly than that you tried to keep him from his bio father. Teenager are not always rational and might not see, that you tried to protect them.\n\nSo being open about the situation, telling Adam, he can think about it and if he wants to, start to write his bio dad a letter/e-mail something when he is 14.

If his rights are terminated he has no legal rights where your son is concerned. If he persists or his caseworker does , you may have to get a protective order, which you can file alone without your son knowing. \n\nAs someone from a highly dysfunctional family, with paternity problems and crime in the mix, I\u2019d suggest you keep your son away and out of this until he\u2019s a fully formed adult.
