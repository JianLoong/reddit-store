Keeping him from his bio dad without letting him be part of that decision can be extremely damaging down the line.", "INFO: Have you spoken with your son about his Bio dad wanting to meet him?", "I think its important to ask what your son wants, obviously you're his parents and have every right to want to protect your son but, if he wants to meet his bio father let him have supervised visits and if he doesn't want to see him anymore, say no but ultimately, i think you should talk to your son.", "I don\u2019t think there are many people here who are qualified to give advice on this. Questions like this are really the wheelhouse of social workers and child psychologists, I don\u2019t feel anywhere near right about trying to answer it. NTA because you\u2019re clearly coming from a place of nurturing and concern. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re RIGHT though.\n\nThe other thing, and again, this seems like a child psychology question, is that every kid is different and handles emotional crisis differently. Without knowing his child, without being familiar with bio dad\u2019s record and progress, I think it\u2019s hard for any of us to say whether meeting bio dad would be a bad thing or not.", "INFO: Defer to a child psychologist, but could you and your wife first meet the Bio-Dad and then decide how to best proceed?  Also, you should ask the psychologist if and how your son should be told that his bio-dad is out of prison and wants to re-establish a relationship (if this is true, and not just the caseworker saying it).", "It should be your sons decision. BUT Bio Dad needs to pass a few drug tests IF your son wants to see him.", "INFO: have you told your son about this? Would you take his desires into consideration if he expressed a want to see his bio dad? 13 is old enough to at least have some say. I think there is a tremendous potential for animosity if you son turns 18 and learns his parents have been keeping this from him for 5 years. It's good you're looking out for your kid's best interests, but part of that is listening and respecting their desires for their own life instead of just making all their decisions for them without their input. For a lot of adopted children meeting a bio parent can bring them answers and closure that they can't get anywhere else.", "Slight YTA. Your son needs to be in the loop of what is going on. He deserves to know that bio dad is currently out of prison. If life is going good for him now, he'll most likely not want to see him but this is info he should have.\n\nI understand the urge to want to protect your son. I really do. My son's mother has been out of the picture for the past three years. If for whatever reason he wants to start talking to her again, I wouldn't like it but there's nothing I could do to stop him.", "I think you should talk to Adam about it and see what he wants.", "YTA. You don't know what the man was going through in the past. You're not only denying his relationship with his son but you're also denying your son to decide on his own. \n\nWhen he gets older and finds out. Believe me he will resent you in some type of way", "It ain\u2019t just some man fresh out of prison. It\u2019s that young man\u2019s father. YTA and i didn\u2019t even read the full post. He has a need and right to know his father.", "YTA for not asking Adam what HE wants.", "YTA - you need to ask your son what he wants. If your son is curious and wants to meet his bio dad, it would be cruel for you not to let him. We all have a right to know where we come from. It\u2019s a matter of identity. Don\u2019t rob your son his right to learn about his origin/himself. \n\nAnd I will give you advice my mom\u2019s therapist gave to my mom when she was divorcing my dad, do NOT, under any circumstances, speak ill of your son\u2019s bio dad (as you have done in this post). You are allowed to think whatever you think of him, but children take this personally because even tho you raised him, that\u2019s his bio dad and that\u2019s where he came from. Children internalize this type of thing. My mom never said anything bad about my dad, and I formulated my own ideas about him as I grew up. I realized, on my own, that my dad was a bad and selfish father. No one had to tell me. The truth always comes out on its own, and your son would appreciate your restraint from saying negative things about his biological father. \n\nAlso, you using your son\u2019s STEM classes as an excuse to prevent him from potentially dealing with this sensitive, yet important situation, is not doing him any favors. This is more important than math class. \n\nPlease seek counseling from a family therapist, not lawyers.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nIt's not selfish to want a connection to your biological child. And you have no idea why the bio dad signed away custody in the first place. You even said his family is a mess and so is your sister. Can you really not see the possibility he believed at the time that being raise by his uncle is better then the life he could have given him? And that maybe he believes now that a closed adoption instead of an open one was a mistake? Because at the end of the day that's still his bio kid and he that's his family, even if he didn't raise him. \n\nYou don't get dibs on a child when you adopt them, you get legal custody, but the choice of whom your child views as a parent is up to them. \n\nIt's clear in the way you talk about your kids' bio father that his imprisonment is a driving force in why you don't want your kid to have contact. I don't know what he did because, you chose not to add it in. But it's honestly better that way for me because being a felon does not mean that person cannot change, is without value, or undeserving of family. \n\nOne of the most famous felons is Martha Stewart. And if being a felon means being removed from your family, then she should never been allowed to meet her grandchildren. \n\nTo me, the context of the crime matters a hell of a lot more than just going to prison. No way in hell will I let my child be around a sex offender, convicted or not. But I'll tell them a kid appropriate reason why, instead of leaving them in the dark with \"your parents aren't around.\" \n\nBio dad's around now, and it's lying to keep it from your child. Thats the dad who gave him life, your the dad who chose to raise him. Both are valid fathers. \n\nI know YOU feel like it's too late, but you don't get to decide that for your son. If it's genuine change you're after, why not meet him before you pass judgment on him? Or figure out what true change means to you? \n\nAll those things are above the pay grade of people who aren't trained and have never been in the position of your child. I haven't had a parent in prison, nor have I been adopted, but I listened openly to those who have lived that life. \n\nTheir viewpoint on what should have happened commonly revolve around honesty, openess, trust, and an earlier and timely presentation of the facts. To have the ability to choose to have contact with a parent who give them away or is in prison. Or the ability to question why the choice has been removed from them. The path you're walking down takes away agency from your child because their autistic. When reconciliation is your kids' choice alone and it is being offered by his dad right now. \n\nAnd hello, I am an autistic adult and this is 100% in my wheelhouse. Right now, you're infantilizing your child and holding him back from a conversation it seems to me that he is ready for and NEEDs to have before adulthood. \n\nIf he is excelling in school and extracurricular activities, then he is ready to start talking about emotionally difficult things and big changes to his life. To me, he's shown the ability to process new experiences, information, and skills and apply them successfully to get into a specilized STEM school. So why withhold this emotional development? \n\nBecause when he starts at this new school the questions start. Basic questions that kids are always asking. What do you mom and dad do? why don't you look like your mom? Are you adopted? Why did your bio parents give you up? Why are you doing that(stimming)? \n\nThen the ship of life will hit the ice burg of\u00a0 internal questions like why didn't my bio parents what me? What is wrong with me? Do I want to meet them? Do I want a relationship with someone who gave me up? Would I accept an apology from them?\u00a0 What are they like? Why am I so different from the people around me? Why do people make fun of me for my special interests and stimming? Are my bio parents autistic too, or am I alone in my bio family? What does it mean to be autistic? \n\nYou are holding him back from developing critical thinking skills, he needs to address those internal questions, during a pivitol point of his development. His own answers to those questions will shape him into the man he's becoming, not just the answers you gave when he was little. \n\nRight now you're not willing to let your child be emotionally uncomfortable and experience a significant change in his life. And I get that as an autistic adult it's hard to navigate an emotionally distressed autistic child after the upheaval to routine and set expectations. Not only from being a child, but from being there for autistic children as an adult. BUT, so many people held me back from emotionally/socially growing as a child/teen because of their own internal beliefs about what I am capable of. Instead of asking a professional about the best way and time to bring up difficult conversation with an autisic child. \n\nIf he's able to comprehend the new knowledge and experiences he will get at his new school, he's ready to talk to a therapist about his own feelings about being adopted, having a parent in prison for most of his life, and whether or not its too late FOR HIM to have a connection with HIS bio parents. \n\nYou are taking away his choice becuase of this view that 'your Dad's a felon,' 'I'm your real dad because I raised you,' 'It's too late for Bio Dad to want a connection with MY son,' 'you're too sensitive to handle the difficulties of your own life,' 'my autistic child shouldn't have to experience change' \n\nAnd that's why I do think you're an asshole. \n\nPreparing an autistic child for adulthood includes messy, and uncomfortable conversations long BEFORE they're an adult.\u00a0 Coddling the sensitive autistic teenager from strife doesn't get them ready for conflict he will face in the job force, or college, or adulthood. Speaking from the experience of being THAT really sensitive, quick to upset, easy to melt down autistic kid, who got coddled for too long. \n\nI have had to face rejection over and over again, sudden changes to my routine, the loss of the community and connection I made when I got laid off after budget cuts. Upheaval, as you put it. And I wasn't prepared for it as an autistic adult becuase no one let me face those kinds of feelings and experiences to this degree as an autistic child. \n\nThis is the perfect training wheels situation for your kid since it comes at a time when his routine is changing anyways and he will have to face what his personal relationship to his bio dad means to him. \n\nThe transition period from childhood to adulthood is extremely hard on autistic folks. All of the expectations and responsibilities have changed. Middle school to high school is also hard but getting support, accommodations, and adjustments to the 504 and IEP are so much easier as a child then as an adult. Since there is so much more support to be given and received at this point in life. There are less accommodations available to me because of my age. And the fact that most places I work for have no idea what accommodations for autism are in the context of a job instead of school. \n\nAleast talking with him now gives him the time to learn how to deal with emotional upset while handling the responsibilities of school. And he will learn where his limits are in a safer environment then the calloused adult world who makes the emotional regulation difficults the individual problem of the autistic person instead of a community problem like it is in school where you have teachers and parents working together to make sure an autistic kid is able get to an emotional regulated state of being.", "I'm gonna say YTA.
