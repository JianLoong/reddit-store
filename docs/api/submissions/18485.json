The boys were 5 at the time. They have always known they have a biomom but everyone agreed that she would stay out of the picture - when the boys turn 18 they can seek her out if they wish. She doesn\u2019t get to barge back into their lives and create more turmoil on her own whim. We\u2019re grateful she initiated and agreed to this, in the best interest of the children. \n\nOP, NTA. Definitely let your boy know what\u2019s up (age appropriately) and that he can do what he wants when he\u2019s an adult. But don\u2019t let anyone guilt you into allowing his EX father to disrupt anyone\u2019s lives. Legally he is not the boy\u2019s dad. He has no rights. And I\u2019m guessing you have not been informed of the full extent of his issues so it could be extremely harmful to expose your child to him. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad he made choices that have left him with a shitty life. Not your problem.", "You raise a good point about it potentially backfiring, but given the situation offered, I trust the father's judgement. \n  \nI can see more ways of this going wrong with him coming back at this stage.", "I think your heart is in the right place with this comment, but I disagree. I have a 16-year old son on the spectrum. Sometimes not knowing things is what\u2019s best for them. In my situation, my ex-wife (his bio mom) has had no contact with him for years. She is now remarried and had has another kid. I don\u2019t see the point in telling my son about his sister, because he\u2019s not going to be able to see her, even if he wants to. Many children on the spectrum don\u2019t handle these sort of emotional issues well and as parents we have to protect them as much as we can.", "A 13-year-old boy is not going to be the best judge of whether his former father would be a good addition to his life. We don\u2019t even know why the guy was imprisoned. He could be the worst of bad. OP and his spouse are the parents. The legal parents. It is their job to make judgment calls in difficult situations. \n\nTheir child deserves to know he\u2019s adopted and that he can seek out the former father when he\u2019s an adult. But unless OP and his wife are enthusiastic and eager for this man to enter their lives and their son\u2019s life, they get to say NO.", "Jsyk functioning labels aren\u2019t really recommended anymore. Support needs(high or low) are better", "Exactly why I said the unpopular YTA.", "He can want. Doesn't mean he's entitled to anything at all.", "I\u2019m adopted and nah couldn\u2019t care less. The majority of other adopted folks I have met also could care less. What matters is the family you\u2019re adopted in to", "Bio dad is a violent criminal. This is not some ambiguous adoption story where the bio parent just wasn't ready to be a parent. Safety is a valid concern.", "Why don\u2019t you back off. \n\nHe\u2019s not threatened by the original father, the original father is in for armed robbery, dealing and other things. The guy only used the son to try to get out of prison early. \n\nOP said dude didn\u2019t even write one letter to try to reconnect from prison. He\u2019s not a good guy. \n\nHe\u2019s actually trying to protect instead of damaging a 13 year old. As OP said, his son can reach out to the sperm donor when he\u2019s OLDER. For now OP is going to protect his son. \n\nYou can do what you want with your adopted child and he can do what he wants with his son.", "Right. When the child is 18\u2019he can do as he pleases. This biodad just got out of prison and who knows what kind of person he even is? OP is right to be wary.", "Case worker sounds incredibly unprofessional.", "And her disrespectful treatment of OPs decision is unprofessional and I hope he reports this. Worked as a pediatric nurse for years and if I was in OPs shoes, I would do the same exact thing.", "Worse he is at the age where kids strike out against their parents\u2026 and who better to fall into than a long lost bio dad who \u201cdidn\u2019t want to give him up\u201d and is now \u201cfree from the system\u201d to ruin an impressionable young mans life\u2026", "I read \"weed\" as marijuana, not \"non-crop plant\" and I'm never changing that interpretation, thank you \ud83e\udd23", "But leaving it until later opens up the door for resenting his adopted parents. I don't think it's completely clear cut.", "As an adult on the spectrum, I disagree with you haha. Unless her son is low-functioning and will need to reside with parents or other family for the rest of his life, sheltering him from emotions at this age won\u2019t do any good. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you and OP to let your kids experience their emotions and feel their way through them with the added support of you helping them if needed- otherwise they\u2019ll move out one day as an adult and have absolutely no concept of managing their feelings.", "That is a good point, and one where you and he would have the experience to make that judgement for your own child. Maybe even have a discussion with a therapist confirming what's best for the boy would be in order. No doubt there's a lot of love and protection coming from you guys, I hope op's situation works out.", "I think it would be a good idea for you and OP to listen to the people who were adopted. It is often looked at very unfavorably that they weren't allowed contact with bio family.\n\nIt is one of the big reasons for pain and suffering.", "OP stated armed robbery and drugs.", "That's all I'm trying to say. That's why i said NAH.", "Maybe add this to the original post? I can\u2019t believe people are clamoring for someone like this to be allowed access to your child. Or thinking a 13-year-old is equipped to make the decision to allow the man into his life. Maybe seeing more detail on the former dad\u2019s background will make people think twice.", "Hey, im jumping on this. I'm hoping you'll see this. You aren't the AH in this situation a couple of things, tho. \n\nYour son will want to know him at some point.\nIf you want to clear all doubts aside go play a game with him board game or sport activity, you'll get to see a lot about him this way and take him to a meal and buy him a couple drinks. Some people do clean up after a rough life. Some don't. This person has a high chance of reappearing in your life, tho so it'd be better if you knew something about him.", "You should find out the agency the case worker works for and call their supervisor and report them. Beyond politely asking once, the case worker has no right or business guilting you or challenging your reasoning.\n\nThey are clearly enmeshed with their client and they're supervisor should know.", "Supervised visits are a thing", "That's a risk they run, but this is about the kid's well-being. Protecting him is worth any sacrifice of their reputation.\n\nThe man needs to prove his stability & trustworthiness for a long period of time, so he doesn't end up leaning on this young, vulnerable kid. A kid who, by all legal accounts, is not his son, & has no obligation to become a crutch for this adult.", "As another autistic adult I have to second you on this one, I struggle to imagine any situation in which shielding him from reality would actually contribute to his long term wellbeing", "I agree. My mom is on the spectrum and was adopted at birth. Her parents hid a lot of info from her and she resented them for it. She always knew she was adopted, but my grandparents refused to tell her anything about her bio parents or let her see them. As soon as she moved out she went searching for her bio mom.", "We\u2019re listening to the professionals who are guiding our process, and the kids know about their biomom and that they can contact them when they\u2019re adults. She\u2019s a sketchy person. Their parents would possibly allow contact sooner if biomom was a different type of person. Before she gave up her rights, there was an attempt at reunification and restored visitation after she had abandoned the kids a few years prior when they were toddlers. The kids did not consciously remember her yet after being with her, one child began exhibited severe anxiety. Not long after, she volunteered to give them up. \n\nThey know they have a biomom. They know the only woman they\u2019ve ever known as \u201cmom\u201d is not their biomom. And they will continue to be protected from their disruptive and sketchy bi until they are adults.", "Yeah, those are good reasons to see how the guy copes with life on the outside before even considering letting him have contact.", "I dunno. Dude was in prison for 10 years. Didn't even try to send letters or reach out. Then used wanting to bond with his biokid as a get out of jail card. That's why prison dude's handler is trying so hard to convince the parents to let him see the child. It's an excuse. \n\nBiodad is an ah for those reasons. And his handler is ah for being upset and mad that the parents are saying no. \n\nAlso I know handler is the wrong word. Only one I could think of while typing this. I'm sure you get what I mean tho.", "Hoping OP sees these comments, and at least seeks out the perspective of adoptees and not a bunch of strangers who have never experienced being separated from their bio family. It\u2019s easy for people to see these situations as black and white, but adoption is so full of grey areas, and there\u2019s a lot of room for resentment to build up if adoptive parents take choices away from their kids.", "That's fair."]}
