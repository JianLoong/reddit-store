It's also weird that she seems to be putting all of her fitness gains on \\*you\\* - like it's cool if she wanted to ask for some casual advice or support, but as you said this isn't your job, or your expertise (which would make more sense for asking you in particular). On her part, this feels way less like she wants some help/support with a lifestyle change, and more like she either wants some reason to be in contact with you again (instead of just reaching out as a friend) or if it's some sort of self-esteem thing.", "NTA.\n\nHer obesity is not your problem, and you can't fix it.\n\nShe needs to figure out what hole in her soul she's trying to fill with food.", "NTA, even if you're still friends you have no obligation to be her personal trainer.

It's not as easy as saying you want to lose weight or that there's a goal post and therefore they'll get their shit together. That's not how this works for most people. It's hard to see progress and it's not easy work to just change their lifestyle after having a routine for months. They'll need support and it's okay that it's not you, but recognize that for future partners, you'll need to be there for them.
