Julia's the type of person who follows every rule, no matter if anyone's watching, I couldn't imagine her committing a crime.\n\nSo when I got a call from her last weekend, saying \"I'm out near your apartment, can I hide something there, it's urgent?\" I instantly said yes. \n\nI knew she'd had her Vespa scooter stolen a year ago, when she left her key in the ignition by accident, and when I opened the door, she was there on what looked like a different scooter, hers had been yellow and this one was black. \n\nShe rushed in and rolled the scooter in, and I asked her what was going on. My boyfriend came in and was also curious, because Julia was sweating like she'd run a marathon and was rolling this beat up scooter in.\n\nShe said she recognized her stolen scooter when she was walking around and looked in an open detached garage and saw it. It was someone in my neighborhood who'd stolen her scooter, they repainted it but they hadn't even removed her stickers before spray painting it and she could still see the shapes of her stickers under the black paint.\n\nShe'd already been to the cops about it when she saw someone riding it in public shortly after it was stolen and they were worse than useless and told her it'd be too much of a liability to confront someone about something worth so little (???) \n\nSo she ran home, got her spare key, and ran back. And luckily nobody was there, so she went in and took the scooter back. But when she was leaving, someone from the house saw her and started to chase on foot, and she fled, but needed to hide the scooter because they were mad and she was afraid they were out looking for her. \n\nI told her that she could hide it here, and I could give her a change of clothes and drive her home so she wouldn't need to walk. But after I drove her home, my boyfriend was furious. Saying how was I supposed to know her call wasn't about something illegal, what if she was bringing trouble to our place, like if the person bought the scooter secondhand and for all they know she just walked into their garage and robbed them. \n\nI said she didn't, it was literally her scooter and I trusted her. My boyfriend said I was being naive and we couldn't just act like vigilantes and act like that's fine or normal, he wasn't comfortable with it. \n\nI feel conflicted. I'm the sort of friend who'll have my friends backs 100% no questions asked. \n\nBut my boyfriend is furious I so readily told my friend she could hide something in our apartment without even wondering what it was or why she needed to urgently hide something.\n\nAITA for letting my friend hide her scooter in my apartment?\n\n---_\n\n\nEdit To answer some common questions:\n\n> Is there a chance it was not her scooter? \n\nNo. Her key (a modern unique key that uses RFID started it) and the VIN matches the VIN on the title which is in ger name.\n\n> She stole it?\n\nNo, it was legally hers. The title is in her name. It has always been legally hers. You can't steal something from yourself. \n\n> What if someone bought it secondhand and she stole a thing they paid for?\n\nThen they did a crime (recieving stolen property) and are frankly lucky the cops didn't get called\n\nAlso, I can't imagine how someone could buy a motor vehicle with no title, no plates, and a rushed shitty spray-paint job, and not at least wonder if it's stolen. Like rule #1 of buying a vehicle is to get the title transferred to your name.\n\n---_\n\nEdit 2 - a lot of people are still doubting it's her scooter, for some reason. Hell, if you want to believe my friend became a hacker overnight and duplicated and spoofed a RFID key, falsified a vehicle title, falsified a robbery a year ago to pretend she had a motove, and robbed an innocent vehicle owner... Okay, go on believing that. I don't know how to help you.\n\nI seriously wasn't expecting this to go in a \"What if your friend is actually a master fraud artist, working you into a web of elaborate lies, like a modern day Moriarty figure\" direction but I swear she's not, she's a student and a hairdresser on the side, not some master theif.\n\n---_\n\nEdit 3... Also, to everyone coming to the defense of the guy who had the scooter... Saying maybe he was innocent and had bought the scooter legitimately, and now has been robbed.. \n\nIf you think it seems legit to buy a badly spray painted motor vehicle, without seeing the title let alone having it signed over, riding it for a year without registration or insurance which is required by law, and not having plates on it... And you think that's normal honest business??  \n\nBro I have a bridge to sell you. It's a great deal, one day only. Gotta act fast!!

My car is 22 years old. It's probably worth more as scrap metal than as a car. But that's the only car I have and if it was stolen I'd be screwed.

Other than that, it was just a basic 26\" blue bike you'd buy from Walmart. When it disappeared I called the police who asked to see a receipt. I obviously didn't have one since it was a gift and explained that. I suggested they could contact Salvation Army to verify they had given him one. They told me they don't usually end up finding bikes that have been reported stolen but they'd keep an eye out. I felt like they weren't going to be very helpful so I started asking about my rights. I asked if I was to see someone riding it if I could confront them to take it? They said that wouldn't be the best idea since I don't know them and they could be dangerous so the better idea would be to take a picture of them and let the police know. Then I asked what if I saw it sitting somewhere without a person there? Could I just take it? They said absolutely so long as I was positive it was my son's bike. I couldn't have proven it since the bike and the seat were both readily available for purchase at a local store but I was still told I could take it if I knew it was the right one. \n\nAll that to say, your friend *has the title with matching VIN* not to mention the sticker outlines under spray paint obviously used to disguise a stolen scooter.

Does your bf have a particular vulnerability to cops - for instance, he's black and you're white, or he's on probation.

If so, still NAH but have a convo about what makes each of you feel safe or not safe in your home\n\n2. Does your bf keep illegal stuff in the house? If he keeps a bunch of weed in the house, kind of shitty to be this bugged out about the scooter.\n\n3. Your friend really should look into your state laws.

To OP, her friend is someone she trusts to follow the law, but OP's boyfriend doesn't have that trust.
