Julia's the type of person who follows every rule, no matter if anyone's watching, I couldn't imagine her committing a crime.\n\nSo when I got a call from her last weekend, saying \"I'm out near your apartment, can I hide something there, it's urgent?\" I instantly said yes. \n\nI knew she'd had her Vespa scooter stolen a year ago, when she left her key in the ignition by accident, and when I opened the door, she was there on what looked like a different scooter, hers had been yellow and this one was black. \n\nShe rushed in and rolled the scooter in, and I asked her what was going on. My boyfriend came in and was also curious, because Julia was sweating like she'd run a marathon and was rolling this beat up scooter in.\n\nShe said she recognized her stolen scooter when she was walking around and looked in an open detached garage and saw it. It was someone in my neighborhood who'd stolen her scooter, they repainted it but they hadn't even removed her stickers before spray painting it and she could still see the shapes of her stickers under the black paint.\n\nShe'd already been to the cops about it when she saw someone riding it in public shortly after it was stolen and they were worse than useless and told her it'd be too much of a liability to confront someone about something worth so little (???) \n\nSo she ran home, got her spare key, and ran back. And luckily nobody was there, so she went in and took the scooter back. But when she was leaving, someone from the house saw her and started to chase on foot, and she fled, but needed to hide the scooter because they were mad and she was afraid they were out looking for her. \n\nI told her that she could hide it here, and I could give her a change of clothes and drive her home so she wouldn't need to walk. But after I drove her home, my boyfriend was furious. Saying how was I supposed to know her call wasn't about something illegal, what if she was bringing trouble to our place, like if the person bought the scooter secondhand and for all they know she just walked into their garage and robbed them. \n\nI said she didn't, it was literally her scooter and I trusted her. My boyfriend said I was being naive and we couldn't just act like vigilantes and act like that's fine or normal, he wasn't comfortable with it. \n\nI feel conflicted. I'm the sort of friend who'll have my friends backs 100% no questions asked. \n\nBut my boyfriend is furious I so readily told my friend she could hide something in our apartment without even wondering what it was or why she needed to urgently hide something.\n\nAITA for letting my friend hide her scooter in my apartment?\n\nTo answer some common questions:\n\n> Is there a chance it was not her scooter? \n\nNo. Her key (a modern unique key that uses RFID started it) and the VIN matches the VIN on the title which is in ger name.\n\n> She stole it?\n\nNo, it was legally hers. The title is in her name. It has always been legally hers. You can't steal something from yourself. \n\n> What if someone bought it secondhand and she stole a thing they paid for?\n\nThen they did a crime (recieving stolen property) and are frankly lucky the cops didn't get called\n\nAlso, I can't imagine how someone could buy a motor vehicle with no title, no plates, and a rushed shitty spray-paint job, and not at least wonder if it's stolen.

Id be worried about your judgement if I was your bf. And to be fair that's probably how he is feeling.", "YTA.\n\nYou basically helped her commit another crime.

Furthermore, it still could certainly be rebought, which would make stealing it back a crime. Better to get it back legally through the police, and certainly not hide it, that makes you look even guiltier.", "YTA.

You\u2019re dragging him into your criminal activity! What if she\u2019s wrong?? Did the key to the scooter work? Does she have paperwork to prove it is hers?

Until and UNLESS you can PROVE it is hers via the VIN then she stole a scooter because you don\u2019t KNOW it doesn\u2019t belong to the person who had it.  Even if you CAN prove it is hers, she STILL shouldn\u2019t be out performing vigilante justice and you STILL shouldn\u2019t be helping her do so ESPECIALLY since your BF didn\u2019t want to do it so now you\u2019ve put him in the middle of a dodgy situation WITHOUT HIS CONSENT.\n\nYTA anyway you parse it, and THINK next time before you commit to what might be a crime.", "YTA\n\nYour boyfriend is right that you\u2019re being naive here.

And I don't think Julia did anything morally wrong, which would be the version of \"nothing wrong\" I'd go with. We can agree to disagree on that point, especially since it doesn't seem to be the boyfriend's issue. His issue was legal liability and the firestorm of trouble that could rain down upon him for harboring a fugitive and receiving stolen property. My judgment on that point is that he's a hysterical wanker who is vastly overstating the amount of trouble that even *might* come his way because of this.\n\nJudgement is for the OP.

She saw someone riding it, called the police and they then determined it wasn't of a high enough value to come and get it back.  I doubt they're going to come and reposess a scooter that doesn't even look like the original description given, as it's value was deemed so low. \n\nRight or wrong, I'd have done the exact same thing. My car is 22 years old. It's probably worth more as scrap metal than as a car. But that's the only car I have and if it was stolen I'd be screwed. It might not be high in monetary value,  but its value to me is very high, and I wouldn't be able to replace it.\n\nAssuming scooters have registration documents, like cars do,  whoever purchased it would have known it was an illegal sale due to lack of papers. What are they going to do? Admit to the police that they bought a stolen vehicle which was  taken back by the rightful owner?", "Because when you buy a motor vehicle legally, the #1 thing you need to do is make sure the seller has the title, and that the title gets signed over to your name. \n\nWithout a title in your name, the vehicle doesn't belong to you, and if you buy a vehicle without getting that, you just got played for a fool tbh.", "> having the police retrieve it\n\nLol that's a tall order, good luck convincing them to give af", "...do you think a thief wouldn't remove the original license plate?

But yes, it is possible because at its core breaking and entering is the unlawful entry into a place you do not have permission to be in. It would be more likely that it\u2019s brought down to a trespassing charge  or a felony trespass depending on how expensive the scooter is but I don\u2019t know the specific circumstances. \n\nOverall, you\u2019re acting like she didn\u2019t do anything wrong but she did. You\u2019re acting like she didn\u2019t do anything illegal, but she did. The exact charge is hard to tell because I wasn\u2019t there and am not a prosecutor. Plus, if the police were unwilling to chase up a suspected scooter their I\u2019m not sure how willing they would be to chase up your friend. But the point is they could, because your grind broke the law.  \n\nShe entered someone else\u2019s private property and couldn\u2019t have known the VIN matched until after she was already in this persons garage.
