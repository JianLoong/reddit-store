{"id": 21818, "submission_id": "14vlb77", "title": "AITA for trying to prove to my parents that my sister keeps copying me?", "selftext": "My sister (26) and I (28) are not on good terms, as universally recognized due to her bullying and selfish attitude, which caused all family members to break off from her. My mom has a soft spot for her as she unfortunately does not get along with anyone and does not interact with any friends or other family members. \n\nI was a bit bothered last year when my sister decided to enroll for a MA in my university, which was in another country as to where my sister was living in, and a completely different faculty from my sister\u2019s BA. I had basically already graduated so I did not mind as much and I left quickly. \n\nFast forward to last year and she keeps copying my motivation letters (which I had stupidly shared 2 years ago with her and a few friends for some feedback). This year she gets a job at one of my previous agencies, also thanks to the copied motivation letters, which she also sent to her BF. She says that the job is boring and if things do not work out she can always just apply to a job with my current agency. Keep in mind that our CVs are completely different meaning I am in the humanities and she is in the engineering field. She just keeps finding those odd jobs that my agencies had. \n\nThe last straw was when I found out that she had attended a conference on the psychological effects of cancer that I was a speaker in (topic completely unrelated to hers) without telling anyone and by smuggling herself in as a participant who said she knew someone with cancer.  I got this from the meeting minutes. I told my mom, who I have a very close relationship with, but she  laughed it off and said she basically admires me and just wanted to get inspiration on how to be a good speaker. \n\nAll throughout, I have confronted my sister and encouraged her to have her own life, while trying to persuade my mom to do the same as she is the only one who has influence over her. I am starting to sound like an evil stepsister according to my mom, and I do recognize that this problem is starting to become a bit of an obsession for me. My mom called me TA as I keep trying to prove to her what my sister is copying, though this is literally the only way I know to try to get her to stop. I found my grown ass sister at my university in another country, at my first job agency (yet in another country) and now in my conferences (still in another country!) \n\nKeep in mind that I do not believe the copying is being done with love, but with jealousy due to the several jealous outbursts she has had at basically every family holiday (which led to the estrangement, that was initiated by me). On top of this my parents believe it is \u201ccute\u201d that my sister is switching countries to try to get close to me (while I actively avoid her).\n\nI\u2019m worried this is borderline behavior from her as well but my parents keep saying it is just her way of looking up to me as I am the one with a \u201cmore stable\u201d life and working in \u201cthe best agency\u201d. Last week my sister even checked out whether my building block had free apartments for rent in case she \u201cdecides to come work for the same agency as you\u201d. I don\u2019t want to end up with her working on my floor for the rest of my life and sending my kids to the same school district as hers-not because she is copying me of course, but because on top of that she has a bullying persona I do not want to interact with. Though I don\u2019t know how to make this stop without sounding like an obsessive and bitter person.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone. I was not expecting all these comments. A few of them were funny made me laugh, such as the one about getting pregnant to see if she will copy that too. The more serious comments are correct-there is not much I can do to stop this except for cut all contacts. I had already cut most contacts with her (she was already blocked on FB) but she will always know where I work and live as I don't intend to move for the next 10 years. The idea about informing HR is good but it's a really big agency so I am worried they might not care and dismiss me as paranoid. I am trying to explain to my mother that this behaviour is not normal also by showing her this forum-I would like to keep in touch with my mother but I will avoid any specific information sharing.", "created_utc": 1688968688, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vlb77/aita_for_trying_to_prove_to_my_parents_that_my/", "score": 1492, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
