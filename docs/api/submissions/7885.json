She had dementia, and basically didn\u2019t eat at all during the last two weeks of her life, so she had gotten very skinny, her skin looked very waxy the way the mortician did her makeup, and her hair was in such a way that she never wore it, dull and tied back. She was pretty jarring to see like that when the last time you had seen her was healthy and full of color. It traumatized my grandma.

He's upset you sent them to him and not that his son was like that and died?\n\nHe only wants to be a father when everything is easy and handed to him on his 'I can't be bothered putting in any effort' terms. He doesn't deserve being called your Dad, that is a sperm donor and an obnoxious one at that.", "NTA. I mean, I wonder if your dad wants you to tell everyone that he refused to come see his dying son.", "NTA, and I'm sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA, it's his own guilt speaking.", "NTA; you were in pain and sought comfort from someone who should have been there to help comfort you AND to say goodbye. Your parents \u2014 both of them \u2014 need to grow up.", "NTA, he got angry at you because he\u2019s ashamed of himself at seeing the raw truth of what he willingly cast aside.", "Gently, YTA. I say gently because youre not an \"asshole\" but you did violate a boundary that your dad made pretty clear. Your dad, regardless of the reason, did not want to see your brother. You sent photos anyways, violating a very clear boundary, and are upset by the results. You have to either accept people for who they are or cut them out of your life. Those are the only two choices you have. You will drive yourself crazy thinking that you can MAKE your dad act they way you think he should. If you continue to have your father in your life youre going to have to accept that this is how he is. If you absolutely cannt accept that behavior, which is totally understandable btw, than you need to cut him off. What you cant do is continue to corner him into participating in situations he doesnt want to be in and being surprised that he lashes out.", "NTA- he probably really hates himself more than you.", "Two wrongs don't make a right. Now he will feel justified for being a lousy apology for a father. NTA but there's no winner here. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "YTA he wanted to have good memories and you crossed a major boundary", "NTA.\n\nSorry for your loss.\n\nSending you hugs, OP.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t go see his dying child to say goodbye because your mom was there? You sent your father pictures of his child\u2019s last moments here on earth. Doesn\u2019t sound like you have a close relationship with him anyway so just tell the people he\u2019s talking to that you\u2019ve had it with his selfishness and move on NC. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA\nI don't see a reason to ever be in contact with your sperm donor again.", "NTA. He should have been there for you both and wasn\u2019t. He will have to live with the consequences of that decision and you showing him photos made it clearer, so his reaction and lashing out says a lot about his character.\nI\u2019m truly sorry for you loss x", "So sorry for your loss!\n\nNTA", "NTA. I can pretty much guarantee the anger he had towards you stemmed from shame he felt being a nonexistent father and not being there in his son\u2019s last moments of life. He knows he fucked him MAJORLY and he\u2019s taking it out on you. Im sorry you have this trauma from your childhood and now and I am so sorry you lost your brother. Please consider seeing a counsellor if you aren\u2019t already. Those are heavy weights to bare and you don\u2019t have to hold it all on your own.", "Let me first tell you I'm so sorry for the loss of your brother. I have lost 2. One to murder, one to cancer and losing a sibling is more devastating than anyone realizes who hasn't had it happen.\nNTA. You didn't hurt your father, he hurt himself. You were grief stricken and upset. Don't take on his problems. He made his choice.", "This man is trying to make his child's passing about himself and is attacking a grieving OP in an attempt to garner sympathy after his unforgivable actions. Anyone with a brain could see right through his facade.\n\nIf I were OP, I'd move on from this horrible man and not give him access to your life. Focus on healing and peace. This man has shown he is no father.", "Same! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d NTA, OP. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "This, exactly. Two wrongs do not add up to the right thing.", "Thank you. You changed my thinking in this", "The purpose is also to be there for the other people who care for the person, such as the OP.", "Anyone have a link to it?", "Link?", "I don\u2019t disagree with that but sending a picture of her dead brother to her absent father because he isn\u2019t there for her isn\u2019t justifiable imo. Dad is an AH for not being there full stop. Still doesn\u2019t justify sending a picture of his dead child as a guilt trip because he won\u2019t mourn with you.", "I know how that is. My mother and I aren't close. Sister invited her to my college graduation. Dad saw her across the room and I got to watch him and my stepmom leave before my row made it to the stage. She laughed when she told me afterwards that she only came so he would leave. Sometimes I wonder which one will boycott my funeral if the other one is there.", "Yes! Every other post on this sub is about weddings. \n\nWho's coming to the wedding? Who's not coming? Who got to be a bridesmaid? Will someone get cake shoved in their face? \n\nSigning papers at the court house never seemed more appealing.", "I didn't read the post but I get where the biodaughter is coming from. She should just keep a distance from the father.", "Link?", "That\u2019s so sad. My mom and bio dad divorced. While my mother wasn\u2019t perfect in what she said about my father, she didn\u2019t do anything to chase him away when we did get to see him. And my father was far more interested in seeing us than disparaging our mother. Him and my stepdad were perfect gentleman to each other. From the outside looking in they would have looked like best friends rather than dad and stepdad who is called dad. That\u2019s the way it should be not showing up at an event to make the other parent leave! That\u2019s hurting the children (or adult children) not the other parent. My ex was very abusive but I wouldn\u2019t ever do that to my children and now grandchildren. I waited to see my first grandchild for 24 hours to make sure my daughter didn\u2019t have to deal with your situation which is exactly what would have happened. A parent\u2019s love for their children should far outstrip the hate for the ex under any circumstance!", "Do you have the link to this post?", "I wonder if it was more about *someone* being there with him. When the dad learned there was, he decided not to go.", "If my kid was dying a literal lake of fire wouldn't have kept me away", "No, he was not. He arrived on Friday. The daughter was asking if he went there on Thursday, when she woke up a few times for a few seconds, not knowing if she would wake up again for real because she was in very real danger of not making it through the night.", "No , IMO , he didn\u2019t \u2026She woke up on Thursday and he didn\u2019t bother to show up at all until the next day. He could have went , and then drove back to the other hospital in time .", "So why did he ask if the mother was there? Sounds like he would have gone if she wasn't, meaning he put his hatred of her above visiting his dying son for the last time.", "Except he went to the funeral she was at. Maybe the mom being at the hospital was the last straw. But really how can we let the son get away with grieving his way, but not the dad. \n\nRead the kids comments. He did it to get a rise from his dad. I get why. I don't even blame him for it. But come on. Who wants to get photos out of no where of their kid dying and hooked to machines?", "That's how the conversation went, how OP read it. But we don't actually know what his decision making was. That could've been the final piece that broke his resolve to go, or maybe he would have forced himself if the ex wasn't there to support OP already. Or it is what it seems and he's an ass", "He had to ask whether a mother is present with her dying son? Is he pathetically dim in this hypothetical scenario?", "> the last straw\n\nMeaning what? Obviously she was going to be there for her son, but that doesn't mean OP's father shouldn't have been there as well \n\n> but not the dad \n\nBecause OP was there for his brother. If the father just didn't want to see his son dying, what he did was extremely selfish. He should have been there regardless of his own feelings, especially when he's put his hatred of his ex over his relationship with his sons their entire lives. He should have put his son first at least once. \n\nIf he didn't want his son to retaliate angrily, he should have been there.", "> That could have been the final piece that broke his resolve to go\n\nThat doesn't make him any less of a selfish asshole. \n\n> if the ex wasn't there to support OP already \n\nThat shouldn't have made a difference. Both of his parents should have been with him as he was dying, especially since he was neglectful for the entirety of his life. He should have put his son before his ex at least once.", "Sigh. It's a perfectly valid question that no, he can't just assume the answer to. You don't know if she was there every moment. I'm just gonna stop replying on here. Jeez.", "The last straw meaning maybe he could have got himself there, maybe he could have handled it. But he couldn't handle his ex and his child dying all at once. \n\nIt's grief. Neither of them handled it well. \n\nLook, I've already been down voted and have had people PM me just to tell me what a horrible person I am. I really don't need any more. \n\nI'm not saying what the dad did was okay. I'm saying they both deserve to grieve how they are able.", "I think so too, yeah. But end of life situations are hard and messy all around, I prefer giving grace in how people deal with it. Even if the person doesn't necessarily deserve it generally"]}
