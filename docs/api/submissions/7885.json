I don\u2019t want to remember him that way, and I hate the family member who sent it to me. I no longer talk to them, as IMO it was uncalled for and callous.

She had dementia, and basically didn\u2019t eat at all during the last two weeks of her life, so she had gotten very skinny, her skin looked very waxy the way the mortician did her makeup, and her hair was in such a way that she never wore it, dull and tied back. She was pretty jarring to see like that when the last time you had seen her was healthy and full of color. It traumatized my grandma.
