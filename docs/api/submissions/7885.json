No parent who refuses to come see their dying child will ever have the right to an opinion or the moral high ground on anything. He knows he\u2019s a terrible father and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t want to see photos. But too bad, he should have come to see his dying child in person. I\u2019m so sorry he is your parent. I would never speak to him again.", "NTA. He\u2019s more concerned about not seeing your mom than having the chance to support and say goodbye to your twin? Not to mention being there for you at a time that must have been devastating. This would be the last time I talked to him. Unbelievable A**.", "NTA no are not. I\u2019m so sorry you lost your twin. I can\u2019t even imagine how much that hurts and especially with the added pain of an AH father. Your dad isn\u2019t mad at you, he\u2019s projecting his cowardice and failure. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. You are so much stronger than your father. I\u2019m glad your twin had you as a brother. I\u2019m sending the biggest hug from afar.", "Wow, NTA. Your dad hates your mom more than he loved your brother. That\u2019s awful. He was choosing not to come, and had no standing to suggest that any of the situation was you causing an issue of any kind. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, your dad couldn't handle the pain of the reality that he missed his last chance to be there for his son. That's not your fault. \n\nYour dad's incapacity to show caring does not mean that your brother and you didn't matter to him. He wasn't capable of understanding that *he* mattered to *you*. Not that his actions are any reflection on either of you. He is stunted. That has everything to do with him and nothing to do with you. \n\nSo very sorry for your loss of your brother. Your brother deserved honor and respect and love in life and he deserves honor and for his memory to be cherished now. Sending you what comfort and peace I can over the internet. Take good care of yourself.", "NTA. If he's going to be immature to the point of not visiting his dying child because his ex is there, then it's the actions of his own consequences.", "NTA I'm glad you hurt him! AH couldn't even come see his child the day he was going to die? Eff him!", "NTA\n\nSo sorry for the loss of your brother.  Your father behaved horribly.  The photos must have been excruciating BUT  - he had the chance to be there for his son but he chose anger at your mother.", "NTA.\n\nThe most sympathetic take is that your dad is displacing his grief and anger at you, because it's less vulnerable for him to blame you than it is to sit with how much pain and perhaps regret he feels. This still wouldn't justify his actions.\n\nIt sounds like, though, your dad was not particularly involved in your life or your brother's, and is pathetic for not being willing to be in a room with someone he does not like for even a few minutes in order to say goodbye to his dying son. He may view the photos as a reminder of how much he has screwed up, or, if he's not feeling guilt, as an effort to guilt trip him (which, in this case, is justified).\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.", "No you are not the asshole. \n\nThis is a heart breaker buddy. I am really sorry you lost your brother.  Your dad was a selfish asshole for not seeing your brother all because he couldn't face your mother. Did he really expect her not to be there? And how he treated you after your brother died was unforgivable. I mean, you probably already have an idea that your dad is a selfish person. I would never speak to him again, but that's me.", "NTA assuming it wouldn\u2019t be something your brother would protest. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and hope you find peace, your dad is and ass and your brother and you both deserve so much better.", "NTA. i understand why he might be a little upset, but if he hadn\u2019t been such an AH, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. it\u2019s his own fault for being so immature about not wanting to see his ex that he refuses to visit his own son.", "NTA I'm so sorry for your loss. Your dad absolutely sucks.", "NTA those pictures you sent will a haunt your father until the day he dies. Even if he deletes them he can never unsee them. Your dad will spend the rest of his life with the guilt of not seeing his son before he died.", "NTA - your father is a monster.", "NTA- He wasn't able to get past his past with your mother to be there to provide support to you and to say goodbye to his own son. Then he plays the victim. He deserves worse than a few pictures. I'm sorry that you went through that with him and I'm deeply sorry for your loss.", "I think your dads an asshole\u2026 personally. but I also think you acted out of anger even tho I totally understand why you felt that way.", "NTA.  I think your dad is reversing the victim and offender here.", "INFO: What were you hoping to happen when you sent the pictures?", "ESH\n\nSending pictures of your dying brother to your father is a little morbid.\n\nBut he\u2019s a giant, gigantic, oversized AH for not going to see him in the hospital. You have to be a whole new level of spiteful to not go because of your ex wife.\n\nSo NTA really \n\nSorry for your loss and that you have to deal with this", "ESH\n\nYour Dad is absolutely TA for not going to see his dying son. Unforgivable AH.\n\nHowever, as someone who has been on the receiving end of death photos, that doesn\u2019t EVER leave you. Sometimes people don\u2019t feel like they can face death, or they may want to remember the person before they were injured/ill. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the right thing by any means, but everyone grieves and processes differently. \n\nI received photos of my grandfather right after he passed, whom was a father to me and raised me, I was closer to him than either of my parents or anyone in my life period. While I wasn\u2019t purposely not there (I live 1200+ miles away but visited every few month), I was grateful I didn\u2019t see the rapid decline. The photos of those final days break me, and that photo of after he passed, it haunts my nightmares. I wish every single day that I had never seen it. I don\u2019t want to remember him that way, and I hate the family member who sent it to me. I no longer talk to them, as IMO it was uncalled for and callous. It was also disrespectful of my grandfather, and not something he would have ever wanted. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, again, everyone grieves differently. However you have done something that will forever impact your father, and will effect his final memories of his son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obviously your dad is an asshole. You are rightfully upset at him. And you sent those pictures to forcefully drag him down to feel your pain. I think you wanted to hurt him.

He left all that responsibility to others because he 'just couldn't'. He wasn't there for you when you needed him. I wouldn't assume he doesn't love you or your brother, he's just someone who puts his own needs first and is quite thoughtless. People defending him not visiting because he didn't want that to be the last memory of your brother rather than due to hatred of your mother probably don't believe your brother should have been left on his own, they just believe your father is less obliged to be there for some reason. He isn't.", "NTA- your dad wasn\u2019t there for your twin when he needed him the most for a petty reason. You showed him what he missed.

He won\u2019t ever be able to get those images out of his mind, nor should he.", "ESH. But you suck much less than him. \n\nWhen my great aunt died, my cousin sent a picture of her after she passed to my grandma (my aunt\u2019s sister) who specifically told my cousin she didn\u2019t want to see her like that because she didn\u2019t want to remember her like that but instead look back on her fond memories of her. She had dementia, and basically didn\u2019t eat at all during the last two weeks of her life, so she had gotten very skinny, her skin looked very waxy the way the mortician did her makeup, and her hair was in such a way that she never wore it, dull and tied back. She was pretty jarring to see like that when the last time you had seen her was healthy and full of color. It traumatized my grandma. It was very much against her will to see her like that, and it burned into her brain. I imagine that\u2019s how your dad felt. \n\nThat being said, its one thing if he had communicated to you that he wouldn\u2019t come say goodbye for the fact that he wanted to maintain fond memories of your brother. Instead, to make it seem like it was because your mother is the problem, and then to see her at the funeral with no issues and instead focused anger on you (which I expect is his shitty way of coping with grief \u2014 redirecting an intense emotion at the fault of someone else) is atrocious. \n\nI understand why you did what you did, but it probably wasn\u2019t the kindest move. That being said, maybe this is a situation where if you are deemed the asshole, you\u2019re okay with being one. Just because you\u2019re an asshole doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a terrible person, if that makes sense.", "ESH", "Which is hella weird because he saw her at the viewing and funeral.", "In that moment, I sent them as a way to validate my brother, he mattered.", "I doubt the father cared since it seems like he only said no because the mother was there.", "Good.

What reaction were you hoping for?", "And yet the father went to the funeral that the mother also attended. Maybe he just didn't want to see his son dying? OP sent the pictures to \"validate his brother\". He wanted to stir the pot and succeeded. \n\nI don't want to call him an AH because grief comes different to everyone.

His interpretation may absolutely be bias on the situation. Maybe the father was asking for other reasons, to try an go when she wasn\u2019t there to give her time to grieve, and when the time came he decided he couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t necessarily agree with not seeing your dying child.
