If she had been super sick they'd have taken her to the hospital. She came to no danger she wasnt left on the side of road all alone far from home. You didnt need to go and you did right not to. You are estranged. Time to block him completely if this is how he speaks to you after three years of estrangement.", "NTA. But you dad very much is the AH. Are you NC? If not you should be.

I would just let them slide and never speak to him again.", "Nta", "It isn't your kid, so right off the bat if I didn't know anything else, this would be enough for you to not be the ah.", "NTA - Dad is being dramatic.

It was a family emergency and every single job I've ever had would have let any parent leave early for it without issue.\n\nNow having said that, if she's used that excuse numerous times before, I could see them writing her up.

It is very sad that this kid had to sit in the office while she was sick but that is the parent's fault, not yours.  You were not asked and didn't agree to take on that role.  You did nothing wrong.

The parents weren't answering their phones.  **They are the ones that signed the paper, this year, to put your name down as a contact, even though you were estranged** and they knew it.  In most schools, it's a paper that gets redone each year.  This was their wrongdoing, not yours.  **She is their responsibility, not yours.**  They are still trying, after three years, to force your compliance to their wants, while ignoring your needs.\n\n*and how distressed she was when her mom picked her up and how his wife lost her job over leaving early.

I told him she doesn't have a sister. That if he wants to give her one, that is between him and his wife.* \n\n**You are right.**  You are not her sister.  His yelling is abusive.  His attempt to make you comply and take on his responsibility for this child, that's emotional abuse.  That he continues to lie to her and tell her that you are her sister, that's on him, too.  \n\n*He called me selfish and said I was disgusting.*\n\n**HE is the one that is selfishly venting on you, invading your space, being verbally and emotionally abusive to you, demanding that you comply with his demands and take on his responsibilities**.  Not you.  Calling you these things is more abusive behavior, and it's lies.\r  \n\r  \n*His family also thought I should have just picked her up and made it clear to dad and his wife afterward it would not happen again.*\n\nIf you had, it most certainly would have happened again.

I would not have picked up the child, either, because, given the history you shared, what if this girl has a bio family member who showed up and claimed that you had no right to take the child ? Freaky stuff goes on like that all the time - that is why you never, ever put someone on the school pick-up list without their express consent and a firm agreement about what you can do with the sick child when you pick her up - do you take her to your house or her house? Are you allowed  allowed to give her Tylenol? How about something for upset tummy? What is she has hurt herself and might have need of an x-ray - how can you get hold of a parent to facilitate that? It is not just picking the sick child up, there is more to it than that. Your dad and his wife were WRONG, WRONG, WRONG to put your name on the school pick-up list without speaking to you after 3 years of estrangement for exactly this type of behavior! His wife losing her job is not on you, either! I am sorry that you got yelled at for things that are not your responsibility or fault.", "NTA (or, well, you were a justified asshole).
