I had a free day and I relaxed at home.", "Again, it is better to leave a sick child with the school nurse than with an 18 year old. If OP were to pick up the kid, then what? This was not a kid in need of entertainment or babysitting while the parents were at work. This was a sick child, how was OP supposed to care for her if the child deteriorated.

She was a baby, so she's your half sibling. How do you know she's not your dad's bio kid. She's probably his bio kid and you should know her. That's why I specified that.", "I wouldn't say you are AH in anyway. You have every right to refuse to do things you don't agree to do. It seems you have made it clear that you don't want to get involved with your father and his new family, but seems like he didn't want to accept the reality.

That's an entirely different conversation.", "When my son was little, I was down as emergency contact for several friends whose children I barely knew. Because that's what we do.

OP didn't.", "There are a lot of people who jump to conclusions and then they start making assumptions and questioning how people can be certain. I have seen it for similar matters. Oh, but this child was so young when your dad claims to have become involved with the mother, how do you know they weren't together longer, etc. There are people who take what is said at face value but I have seen threads get derailed by talk like that and pushback when someone answers that they just no. I wanted to prevent that at all cost.", "I know. I mentioned that they should have asked her first before putting her name down. I also think it was right that she told school to take it off.

Where were you supposed to take her? To your house where she shouldn't be? Or to their house where you probably don't have a key to or want to be? They made this mess by being ignorant assholes. NTA. She probably barely remembers you unless they've been feeding her nonsense.\n\nShe hasn't seen you for three years. Those three years are 15 to 18. Some people change a lot between those years. What if you went to pick her up and she didn't recognize you or remember you and started screaming? Or freaked out? This was just completely impractical.", "NTA. Your dad and his wife are delusional.

Not pawn shit off on others, or be a doormat.\n\nYou want a doormat.", "What difference does it make if the child is sick at school than sick at home? At school, the kid was probably at the nurses office. OP was not going to take the child to the doctor, just take the kid home. And honestly, OP is just barely an adult. She doesn\u2019t want to have any ties with her abusive father. Going to pick up the child is leaving that door open with her dad. She did not consent. And no means no."]}
