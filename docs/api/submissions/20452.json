This led to a bunch of fallout and her being stuck in school way longer than she should have been from the sounds of it. Also, his wife lost her job. Mostly a 6 year old was sick in school and nobody could pick her up right away and I could have gone. I wasn't doing anything.

While she sees you as a sister, you were forced to be her \u201cbigger sister\u201d and because of that, it seems you resent that role, and you never got to grow into that role. And that is on them.    \nAnd to force you to be a parental figure now, and enlist you as an emergency contact?

Once you'd done it once you would have been expected to do it every time, good on you for setting the precedent that it's not going to happen.\n\nNTA", "Technically NTA. However, I just feel bad for the kid.

Also your dad and his wife put you as an emergency contact, that too while you were still a teenager without taking your permission, they didn't even bother to tell you are in the list and you had no idea you were even in the list till the call from school came makes you even more not the asshole in the story.\n\nI hope you realised from this whole situation where your dad's priorities lie and how little he thinks, cares and is considerate of you. Remain NC with your dad and also block and go NC with his entire side of the family.

The child was sick, was OP supposed to take her to the doctor, or administer medication ? If the parents did not pick up the phone when the school called, would they have picked up when OP called ?where was the child supposed to stay while sick till her parents got off work?\nOP is not the AH.", "I wasn't busy. I had a free day and I relaxed at home.", "Again, it is better to leave a sick child with the school nurse than with an 18 year old. If OP were to pick up the kid, then what? This was not a kid in need of entertainment or babysitting while the parents were at work. This was a sick child, how was OP supposed to care for her if the child deteriorated. And if OP did pick her up, where was she supposed to drop her if her own parents were at work and didn\u2019t pick up the phone.", "Would you pick up a strange child from school? After not seeing her in three years and never really wanting to be her babysitter in the first place, we are essentially strangers.

She was a baby, so she's your half sibling. How do you know she's not your dad's bio kid. She's probably his bio kid and you should know her. That's why I specified that.", "I wouldn't say you are AH in anyway. You have every right to refuse to do things you don't agree to do. It seems you have made it clear that you don't want to get involved with your father and his new family, but seems like he didn't want to accept the reality. As you stated, that's his problem, not yours.\n\nHowever, all the drama aside, you can be a better human if you help people in trouble (in this case, I mean the kid, not your father).", "We're getting way past the content of the post. There was no discussion of what was wrong with the child or why she needed to be picked up. That's an entirely different conversation.", "When my son was little, I was down as emergency contact for several friends whose children I barely knew. Because that's what we do. I didn't get the impression this episode had anything to do with the girl.

OP didn't.", "There are a lot of people who jump to conclusions and then they start making assumptions and questioning how people can be certain. I have seen it for similar matters. Oh, but this child was so young when your dad claims to have become involved with the mother, how do you know they weren't together longer, etc. There are people who take what is said at face value but I have seen threads get derailed by talk like that and pushback when someone answers that they just no. I wanted to prevent that at all cost.", "I know. I mentioned that they should have asked her first before putting her name down. I also think it was right that she told school to take it off. I just would not have left a child at school when I could have helped."]}
