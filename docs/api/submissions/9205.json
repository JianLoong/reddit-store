{"id": 9205, "submission_id": "10ug28m", "title": "AITA for telling my friend to quit victimizing herself over her \"trauma\"?", "selftext": " I honestly want to know if I was heartless or not, so don't be afraid to be brutally honest, but I did feel like I reached my point.\n\nI met Jill when we were kids. When we met she had family issues. During our friendship she had family issues. When we fell out she had family issues. When we made up she had family issues. And not only family issues. She had all kinds of issues. I pitied her. A lot. And I wanted to help her. I cared for her very much, I loved her truly and she's the one who taught me many many things about human relationships including tolerance and kindness.\n\nHowever, it's been years. Every single day of her life, she's got something to be upset over. She had fights over time with her dad, her mom, grandparents, the extended family and whatnot. I tried to be there for her but was always met with \"you wouldn't know/you wouldn't understand!\" I offered my help to the point I stopped and told her to just ask me for help if she needs. She seemed to never ask me or care for my suggestions of solving the said issue.\n\nI have to say, growing up I was by far more privileged than her, but I still gave everything I had to help her. I even supported her financially when needed. (And when I could. I'm not some kind of ultra rich millionaire's daughter). She would nod, do nothing, and then still be sad. She's now old enough to fully take on consequences of her actions and to decide for herself how to live life. She's no longer the helpless kid that got pity years ago.\n\nAnd recently I reached the last straw. She complained as usual about something, I tried to let it go, but she was way too invested. So I told her to stop victimizing herself every freaking day and understand it's her damn choice to live like this. I told her the power to be better is in her hands and I'm sick of her refusing to improve herself. Me and the other people around her came up with solutions that she just dismisses. She considers that the only people to \"get her\" are those who pity her and kiss her ass. I told her I'm sick of all of it and I don't want this energy in my life anymore.\n\nOf course she said I wouldn't get it, that I'm heartless and I don't get her trauma. I told her she's the only one twisting the knife deeper instead of just trying to heal. She said she's trying but I pointed out that in all those years, she's never changed anything about her lifestyle and vision towards it. I told her she's aiming to be sad and settled to be like that. As long as she's not eager to step out of the cursed comfort zone she ain't getting better.\n\nShe was sad and called me many many words. I think she needed to hear that. Given the fact that I know her well, I don't think I disregard the trauma. I think I served her the cold truth.

She don't want them", "NTA. As a trauma victim and domestic violence survivor, I understand all too well the circumstances you've described. I know many people who \"settle in\" to their trauma and aren't willing to do the work necessary to change their own life. Trauma can break people, but it also has the unique ability to turn a victim into a survivor. They become a diamond under the pressure. They shine. You didn't do anything wrong by making her face facts. If she continually dismisses advice from you and others who are trying to help, continues to act the victim, and doesn't attempt to make positive changes, then she doesn't deserve a friend like you. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s so focused on being a prisoner of her past that she\u2019s keeping herself from building a future where she\u2019s free. That\u2019s a choice that she\u2019s making and she needs a bit of tough love to get herself to break that cycle and get to therapy. \n\nBut you also need to realize that if she\u2019s too comfortable in the \u2018give me sympathy and do things for me because you feel bad for me\u2019 cycle, then she may not want to change.

This seems too vague to make a judgement.", "NTA. life is short, enjoy it on your own terms. peace.", "NTA but the steps you are taking are counterproductive:\n- be clear about the effect of her actions on YOU.

It sucks for her she\u2019s had a harsh life, but at some point you have to realize it\u2019s not the life you always have to live, and help yourself.

I was that person as an edgy teenager and no, it\u2019s not fun. I realized it\u2019s just obnoxious. Which is why I stopped. If you actually care about someone, there\u2019s a very fine line between venting and just being a miserable ass ALL the time. Some people are just inherently negative, and it really is up to them to either keep crying or look for solutions. You have to have ambition to make your life better if you actually want it to get better. And you also have to take that step to ask yourself, \u201cdo I actually want a better life? Or do I just like complaining?\u201d It\u2019s a tough convo that most people aren\u2019t willing to have. \n\nI\u2019d distance myself from her if I were you, might be one of the only ways she learns. Your friends aren\u2019t your dumping grounds. Yes, they\u2019re supposed to support you but you gotta learn to just deal with some shit on your own. Everybody gets pissed off at little things but most people just simply let it go, which is what\u2019s healthy. I\u2019m not a person that thinks that emotions should be shoved down or anything, but we all go through our own shit. Stay on your grind, talk about the things that actually matter. Not every little thing has to be a point of interest. Some people just like being negative and enjoy complaining.", "NTA - The truth can be a bitter pill to swallow but like you said, she needed to hear it. Sometimes this comes with depression and the lack of motivation to make those changes. If that's the case I hope she does take your words as an opportunity to seek the help she needs.", "NTA. There are a lot of people who need to define themselves as victims and simply aren't interested in helping themselves. You've stuck with this one a lot longer than I would have.", "Very much this. A lot of people just want to say what their problems are out loud and aren't looking for solutions. I always ask whether friends are just venting or if they're looking for problem solving when they start talking about their problems. And I make it clear I'm happy to just listen.", "OMG Yeah you are right it is the same person"]}
