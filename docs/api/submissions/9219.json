When I say loud, I can hear her panting like a dog while they screw through the wall. I can't even sit at my desk when they are together because my desk will ricochet off the wall while they are fucking. This occurs around 3-4x /week, and we are all grad students--so we are all pretty busy and studying. Another roommate had already spoken to \"Emma\" about keeping the noise level down in Dec. It's now Feb, and the noise level hasn't changed.\n\nAlso, \"Emma\" has made a copy of our house key and given it to her boyfriend. Boyfriend now lets himself in when she isn't there and stays in the house even after she leaves to go to school. As an all-female house, its pretty inconvenient because don't feel comfortable walking around in a towel anymore. And like I said, he is here 3-4 times a week from 4pm-the next morning.\n\nConfronted \"Emma\" and her response is that \"she pays rent.\" I drafted an email to landlord with screenshots from the lease. My other roommate is also willing to corroborate these facts. WIBTA for getting her evicted?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add:\n\nThe house is rented out by room. So Emma being evicted would not effect me/drive up my monthly payments. My other roomie who is frustrated and I both plan on going the landlord and threatening to break our leases if something is not done about this issue. I would also like to state that    I have 0 problems with the other roommates who occupy this dwelling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe exact phrasing of the words in the lease is:\n\n\"Tenant is entitled to quiet enjoyment of the premises. Tenant and guests or invitees will not use the premises or adjacent areas in such a way as to create a nuisance by annoying, disturbing, inconveniencing, or interfering with the quiet enjoyment and peace and quiet of any other tenant or nearby resident\"", "created_utc": 1675614893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ugp04/wibta_for_convincing_my_landlord_to_evict_my/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it was just the noise, maybe you would be. But even then, you\u2019ve set boundaries and she\u2019s continuing to cross them, therefore I think it would be justified to ask her to move out. \n\nHer making a copy of the key for her boyfriend (presumably without asking you guys if that\u2019s ok) is a huge no from me. As well as him being there so often. You didn\u2019t agree to live with her AND her boyfriend.\n\nShe\u2019s chosen to disrespect you and the other roommates, over and over again. You deserve a safe, quiet, peaceful house!", "NTA Once she gave him a copy of the key there is no question that she overstepped. Before giving a spare key to anyone it should be agreed upon by all the tenants of the property. That to me is the very worst thing she did. He should not be in the apartment if she is not there either. He is her guest, once she leaves there is no reason for him to be there.\n\nShe may trust her BF. There is no reason for you to trust him. IMO, and it may sound dramatic, but she put your safety at risk by doing this. At the very least you have less peace of mind, knowing that he can come in without you knowing while you are sleeping or in the shower. I would be very uncomfortable.", "I think you'd have a better chance going to the landlord with the fact that she gave an unauthorized copy of the key to someone.  That's usually a violation of a lease.\n\nNTA", "NTA - for everyone who ended up living with a roommate who de facto moved a boyfriend/girlfriend in without permission, I hope you are able to get her kicked out. Good luck.", "NTA, and most landlords would probably remove her for making copies of the key alone. Thats a HUGE nono", "NTA, but... Who is on the lease?  If Emma is not on the lease, but you are you probably have the ability to ask her to leave.  If she is on the lease, it gets more complicated.\n\nThis whole post reads very young to me.  Your landlord is not interested in negotiating your petty roommate squabbles.  The peace and quiet thing there does not mean that the landlord is interested in talking to Emma about her loud sex life.  It is more of a boiler plate thing.  Maybe they will care about the key, but it really depends on the landlord.\n\nYou are in a bad situation, but I think you may be overestimating the landlord's interest in getting involved.", "NTA and if or when Emma gets evicted get the locks changed.", "NTA. You gave her every chance.\n\nShould be pretty easy to have her evicted when she made a copy of the house key. Hope it works out for you.", "YWNBTA she pays rent he doesn\u2019t. Plus nobody wants to hear people hammering like it\u2019s dooms day.", "I was ready to say NTA before you got to the part about her giving him a key and him hanging out in your house without her there.  And at that point I\u2019m thinking why do you even need to ask? Her complete disregard for her roommates and their comfort and the fact that you have already tried to address this with her nicely says definitely NTA to me.", "I hope you told your landlord about the key she's given her boyfriend too, he'll need to recover that.", "Her giving a key to the place to someone else puts your safety at risk. Definitely go to the landlord. NTA", "NTA. She pays rent, you pay rent, your other roommate pays rent. Her boyfriend doesn't but seems to spend 80% of his time at your place. He has a key, lets himself in and is the public spaces.\n\nI'd focus on that and fact she has created a security issue rather than the noise.", "NTA, because of the key issue. At the very least, change the locks. As for the noisy sex, tell them to use the boyfriend\u2019s place.", "The key thing and how often he is there are your biggest leverage points.

She\u2019s not being a considerate roommate.", "NTA. Emma sounds like a shifty roommate!", "NTA\n\nShut it down.  Emma is being super rude.", "NTA. She\u2019s inconsiderate and has made the house unsafe by giving a non-resident a key.", "WNBTA as this would be a willful violation of the lease but she does have a point... she pays rent. She's just not being considerate of the rest of you. Giving the key to her boyfriend is also potentially putting the rest of you at risk.\n\n1) Check the lease regarding extra keys and when they are allowed to be made.\n2) Do you have documentation showing that y'all tried to reason with her about the sex?\n3) Since it sounds like your room is next to hers, can she be heard elsewhere in the house?\n4) Is there mention of guests and their length of stays?\n5) Are there gender restrictions based upon it being an all-female apartment for overnight guests?", "Ywnba BUT with the roommate gone comes extra expenses that need to be made up. If she's evicted, you legally can't recoup anything from her. That would be the landlord and you would still be responsible for the remaining lease. Now loud sex just might not be a valid reason by the court to evict someone. \n\nThe landlord can force said roommate to retrieve the key especially if the other roommates are not comfortable, plus they have no reason to have a key. Is it explicitly stated in the lease not to?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
