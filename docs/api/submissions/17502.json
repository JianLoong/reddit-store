Then when she got home..she ripped into it herself. The whole concept of asking you to wait, as if it was meaningful to share the moment all together was shot. \n\nYour gift was already opened, and its just weird of her to expect you to put on a show of pretending to open it for your dad. There was nothing to do but take your gift and go.\n\nI dont think its childish or petty either...My kid is only a bit older than you, and we have many times asked one another to wait on something cause we wanted to experience it together. Not even just special occasions, whether its opening a letter with big news, or waiting to try something new, or whatever...but especially for special occassions we wait for each other. Theres nothing childish about agreeing to, and looking forward to a moment with a loved one that you agreed to share together.\n\nThinking of all the times we wanted to watch a movie or show together, if I was like, yeah I went ahead and watched it first to make sure its good, but just pretend I didnt and act like we're seeing it together for the first time.

Why tell you to wait so they can \u201csee your reaction\u201d and then open it in front of you?

Not really caring about her daughter's reaction.\n\nThe mom set the daughter up to be expecting to open the gift while her parents watched.\n\nOnly to kind of flip it?\n\nI can see the puzzlement over that scenario leading to increase the disappointment over not being the first person to open her own gift.  Regardless of knowing what it was or not.\n\nPetty maybe a little bit, but when it's your birthday present from your parents even at any age Is something to look forward to which it feels like was taken away.  And yes, she knew what it was but it's not like she physically held it in her hands.\n\nAnd yeah I understand not really wanting to go over it again.  Because it just reminds you of that getting to open a present feeling that was taken from you.\n\nAnd I don't know if you've been able to do much for your birthday. This might have been the only thing that you had going for it.  Which would add to the disappointment I'm sure.\n\nEither way the setup was just kind of odd.\nRegardless, happy birthday!", "NTA.  That was odd but I guess she wanted to see if her purchase was correct.  I would let it go and try to enjoy your day. Happy Birthday!", "Wait, did she like repackage it or something and then tell you to \"open\" it? It's weird that she asked you to wait and then opened it herself. I'm not really understanding the other judgements here bc it's pretty clear that it hurt your feelings and that's valid. Even if some people think it wasn't a big deal, it was to you. People are different and feel differently and it's not right to discount someone's feelings because you don't agree with them. So I'm going with NTA", "NTA.

Were you asked not to tell your father that she opened it first? \n\nI ask because I had a mother who would routinely control me and one of the ways she did that was by opening my gifts.

Were you afraid she\u2019d\u2026 steal them?", "And since it\u2019s belated, what\u2019s another hour for mom to wrap it nicely and dad to get home so they can both give it to her?", "She and my oldest sister have a petty thief trait built into them, unfortunately. She often \"borrows\" things, and I never see them again.", "it didn't seem that was what mom intended, since she opened it right in front of OP instead of taking the package into her room to check it and wrap it.", "Right? I mean, you order something for someone online, you open the package up to check if its okay and rewrap it or whatever. You're not handing them the corrugated cardboard box directly off your stoop", "But like, right in front of you? When you knew they were there and were going to open them soon?", "Exactly. Reddit is full of young people who want instant gratification and think of one side, the child, usually. There's etiquette to RECEIVING gifts just as much as giving. Checking that mail gifts aren't broken/wrong and waiting until it's nicely wrapped is basic and Redditors do actually possess this knowledge.", "ESH. I open presents that I give others to ensure they aren\u2019t damaged and that they arrived as I ordered. However, I do re wrap them, so I get where you are coming from.", "YTA. Mom was just checking to make sure everything was ok", "What the heck? And why all the Y T A comments?\n\nNTA Mom trampled all over the pleasure of opening a gift, even if you knew what it was. Does she make a habit of turning all your special days into some kind of weird boundary issue? It doesn\u2019t matter how old you are or if you know what\u2019s in the box, it was YOUR gift!!!\n\nI\u2019m sorry she ruined your gift. HUGS", "But her mom TOLD her not to open it until both parents were home. She complied, then her mom opened it. That is way infuriating. Mom then wanted her to do a fake opening. Why couldn't her mom just wait, too?      NTA", "NTA because why did your ma have to open it up in front of you? She could've easily checked it somewhere else. \nSeems like it's more than about the earrings at this point", "My mom will make sure stuff she ordered is okay, and does a light seal, but we never see that. You can be mad about it, idt she was intentionally trying to hurt you \n\nBut I guess\u2026if they were damaged, was she not going to give it to you \ud83e\udd14", "Yta.  Stop overreacting.", "ESH\n\nHow are you gonna get your earrings out if you don\u2019t open it now?\n\nI wonder if mom was worried she ordered the wrong thing. Or maybe has another package coming for herself she doesn\u2019t want to mix up", "Exactly, I don't understand the problem here. It is birthday gift which she will eventually get anyway. How does it matter who opens it? I am still confused what the issue is.", "Exactly. Why did OP\u2019s mom ask her to wait? Sound like OP is in the clear since Mom was asking her to jump through hoops for something she already knew about. So it should be NTA then", ">I don\u2019t even see how that\u2019s petty\n\nreddit hates parents. Reverse the parent and the daughter in this scenario and mom would be told to grow up.", "You should edit this in to your original post", "You should add this into the original post \u2013 plus her weird thing about emeralds!", "I agree with your statement 200%.. mom was wrong to open up something she knew wasn\u2019t for her. If it was damaged they would have found out when op opened it wouldn\u2019t they?? I don\u2019t know why op acted the way they did but to me it doesn\u2019t sound this is first time mom took a moment away from op. I could be wrong\u2026", "My hubby just rolls his eye every time i get a delivery because I turn into a kid at Xmas. He says, \"You know what's in it because you ordered it,\" to which I reply, \"yeah and\". \n\nI agree I think the mums behaviour is weird and more like a power play then a \"concerned mother checking her daughters present was correct and undamaged\". OP is 24 and can handle the disappointment or an incorrect or damaged delivery.", "Yeah it is weird, no one I know IRL is like that", "You have a pint of she hadn\u2019t opened them in front of OP. I can understand checking them and wrapping them. But to do it in front of OP is ridiculously pointless and possibly a power play", "People must be running out of problems if this is considered a \"problem\". \n\nYTA for even starting this thread to each I'm angry-answering.", "One word ; spoiled", "You are a grown woman. You picked out the gift. You knew what it was and what it looked like already. You tattled to your dad. You threw a fit and refused to open the gift. Grow up. YTA", "Eh ESH. You were a little childish and immature about it. You knew what it was anyway. But she could\u2019ve taken it to a different room to check, and even rewrapped it to make up for opening it.", "NTA, I have had a couple of gifts opened by others and it really soured the experience.", "YTA", "NTA. I think it\u2019s super weird your parents asked you to wait, then your mom opened it in front of you? Sounds like a power move imo\u2026", "NTA.\nThe gift was for you and she opened it in front of you, instead of letting you open it. That takes so much of the excitement out of the whole experience.", "It's not about OP knowing. Mom TOLD her to wait and open it until both parents were home, then proceeds to open it first anyway and in front of her. What was the point? Why make her wait if she was going to do this? I almost guarantee this isn't the first time mom has pulled something like this", "To check if the studs were broken. Obviously. Like you do with any online purchase, that is a gift for someone.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering. Is the mom dumb, or maybe they\u2019re the type of parent who doesn\u2019t understand boundaries", "Wow changing the word \"mother\" to \"husband\" changes the aspect of the story very differently, but I can't put my finger on the reason why.", "Holy crap way to completely miss the point! It's not that mom opened it to look. It's that she made this big deal about making OP wait until both parents were home, just to open it in front of her anyway. There was absolutely no reason for any of that", "Not the freaking point!", "Literally why do ppl not think adults can enjoy their birthday? It\u2019s not petty to be upset or disappointed in her mother\u2019s actions. It doesn\u2019t matter if she knew what it was or not. I have picked out my own gifts before and still get excited when they come. If she needed to check to see them weren\u2019t damaged that badly, do it in a room where OP cannot see.", "As someone who has a very difficult relationship with my father, the little things start to annoy you after many years, as every instance of them doing something shitty builds up, and you want explode, which may explain their reaction. I have felt this way way too, about things that to alone aren\u2019t that bad, but when you\u2019ve dealt with years of crap from that parents it makes your blood boil.", "And wrap it in pretty paper with a bow and card, gotta love mail openers. Can\u2019t leave others stuff alone.", "Yeah but is it a reasonable or proportional response to that rudeness to just reject the gift she really wanted completely? Who is this pettiness hurting?", "And the daughter couldn't have done that herself? Mom opened in front of OP, so if they were broken OP would have seen it anyway. Why not just let her open it", "By those weird Reddit ppl\u2019s logic my great grandma\u2019s 100th birthday didn\u2019t matter because she\u2019s an adult. Seriously, like, if a gift means something to you, or that day means something to you, you have every right to want to enjoy it. I feel like those are the Reddit ppl with no friends or family who claim you shouldn\u2019t celebrate your birthday because they\u2019re lonely and bitter.", "How about don't make a big deal about making a person wait to open something if you plan on opening it yourself anyway", "Well how would you feel if someone told you they wanted you to wait to open your present so they can see your reaction then they proceed to snatch the present as soon as they arrive and open it in front of you, take it out, look it over and then put it back in the box and hand it to you to reopen and\u2026what? Act surprised?\n\nNTA- moms behavior makes no sense whatsoever. Who opens someone\u2019s gift in front of them and then puts it back for them to reopen?\n\nLike I\u2019d maybe get opening it if op wasn\u2019t there when it arrived and she wanted to be sure it was right/looked like it did online whatever.\n\nThat would have made sense. This? This is just bizarre. The person the gift was for was standing right there *watching* her.\nThis is really weird behavior", "Except that's NOT what happened so", "Maybe, but it was not like the mom opened the box, took out the gift, and gave it to her without the box. She boxed it up again and then gave it to the daughter to open it. So technically the daughter did open it.\n\nAlso why can't the daughter look at another perspective? Sometimes deliveries go wrong. So maybe mom wanted to be sure that the right gift had been delivered. \n\nAnd about mom and dad both being there, maybe they had a talk or it was understood that it is okay if one of them is there.\n\nI don't get it. What is the big deal here? Did the mom use the gift? No. She checked it and replaced it and gave it to her to open.\n\nThe gift that EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT ANYWAY.", "Funny enough, mom could have still made sure when OP opened it. There was no reason for her to open it first.", "Why did mom need to open it at all? What do you mean give it to her properly? She opened it IN FRONT OF HER.", "Only if you plan on wrapping it up and giving it to them later. You don't open it with them in the freaking room"]}
