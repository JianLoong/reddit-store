Super petty.

I would understand wanting them to open it discreetly, wrap it for you, and give it to you properly with both of them in attendance so it still feels like an event instead of just opening mail. That would show some effort. \n\nBut.. wanting to have both of your parents there specifically because you want them both to witness you \u201creact\u201d to something you already know you have? What kind of \u201clook at me\u201d energy is that?\n\nIs OP 7 years old and putting on a dance recital in the living room? What?", "Her mom is a jerk for asking her to wait then opening it herself", "My understanding was that Mom asked OP to wait so the parents could see her reaction and OP agreed, not that OP necessarily cared about them seeing her open the gift", "Lmao that\u2019s what I thought too. And in that case I think OP is an AH and exhaustingly dramatic.\n\nMom didn\u2019t want OP to open it randomly for precisely the reason I outlined - so she could give it to OP properly. Who TF cares if mom opens it first? Mom *bought* it. To *give* to OP."]}
