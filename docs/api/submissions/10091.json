Because her stepdad's family live far away (a 4 hour drive) she took the whole day off and planned to drive there with her brother.\nI was invited as well but we have two kids (6 and 2) so we agreed that I would stay home and take the kids to school/daycare and go to work.\n\nSo far so good!\n\n\nUnfortunately our youngest got sick in the days prior to the funeral and I was going though a big project at work that I've  been leading AND my wife has to go to an important seminar, the days before aswell. Therefore i had to stay home, first one day, then my mom took af day off to watch him while i was working and then I took another day off,  while my wife was at the seminar. Now the day before the funeral i told my wife, that i can't take anymore days off from work, i absolutely have to go in tomorrow, my mom is not an option and the kid is still sick. \n\nAt the day of the funeral I go to work and because our kid i still sick, my wife stays home instead of going to the funeral and when i get home, she is pissed! Talking about, how i let her stepdad down, that she really wanted to go for his sake and how i thought work was more important than that. \nNow, I am truly sorry that she couldn't go and i gave my condolences to her stepdad and told him, that i was sorry about the whole situation. But my wife is still mad at me\n\nTo Summarize:\n\nI went to work knowing that my wife would have to stay home and watch the kid instead of going to the funeral. She's says that I'm TA because she wanted to support her stepdad and i prevented that.\nI think I'm NTA because, she didn't knew the dead guy very well and i already skipped work twice in the middle of an important project so she could work.\nNevertheless i feel like an asshole, but what should've done?\n\n\nPS bare with me on the writing, English is not my native language\n\n\nEDIT:\nI come to the conclusion, that i was TA which definitely wasn't my intention but as many of you has stated in the comments, i chose me and my work over her and something she can't do over.\n\nI realized that if something similar happens again, i rather be an asshole to my job than my wife, and i would sincerely hope that she would do the same for me.\n\nI also think that the main problem here was our communication (or lack of it), we where both super busy and with the sick kid and the funeral, we just didn't manage to plan it very well, which we both where responsible for.\n\nSo i will apologies to her again when she comes home and have a talk about how we can handle stuff like this in the future. We been together for almost 9 years (married for one) and I'm sure we can work this out. \n\nThanks you all for your inputs, both the \"NTA-sayers\" for supporting me and my decision and the \"YTA-sayers\" for making me look more inward", "created_utc": 1676530214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113kb7c/aita_for_preventing_my_wife_to_go_to_a_funeral/", "score": 2054, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You assumed that your work would be the priority, and that she would stay home to watch the kid so you could do that.  What your wife wanted to do was automatically the lowest priority to you, and the first thing you sacrificed when there was a conflict.  \n\nTo me, that is the AH behavior in this post.  Dismissing your wife\u2019s concerns and needs (\u201cshe didn\u2019t know the dead guy very well\u201d) just solidifies that YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou should have figured out.

If you respect her and love her, you\u2019ll apologize for making her miss something that she can never make up for.

You just missed one, and in doing so forced your wife to miss one.", "NTA. \n\nIts so simple. 2+2 = 4. There\u2019s been 4 days where your kid was home sick and required one of you to be with him. Day 3 & 4 your wife wanted to go to her important work event and her important personal event. So she should\u2019ve taken day 1 & 2 off to stay home while you got your work done. (Or since your mom could take off day 2, she should\u2019ve taken off day 1). \n\nInstead she only took off the day of the funeral, thinking you (and your family) could sacrifice work for her work and family, and took none of the days off required to be with your mutual child while you\u2019ve taken 2.", "NTA\u2026.

I get that her seminar must have been important, but was it more important than your project and the funeral? There has to be some compromise. Maybe she could have skipped the seminar so that you could go to work, and she could then go to the funeral. If you sprang it on her suddenly that she wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the funeral, it\u2019s not surprising she\u2019s upset.

It\u2019s not someone else\u2019s job to try and find that information out", "You made it clear that you\u2019re the one that digs information out of your husband.

She doesn\u2019t need to take on the emotional burden of making all the arrangements herself", "Yeah no - I said we discuss it.  That\u2019s what I meant.

We communicate which is obviously something you do not know how to do."]}
