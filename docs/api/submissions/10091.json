You assumed that your work would be the priority, and that she would stay home to watch the kid so you could do that.  What your wife wanted to do was automatically the lowest priority to you, and the first thing you sacrificed when there was a conflict.  \n\nTo me, that is the AH behavior in this post.

If you respect her and love her, you\u2019ll apologize for making her miss something that she can never make up for.

Day 3 & 4 your wife wanted to go to her important work event and her important personal event. So she should\u2019ve taken day 1 & 2 off to stay home while you got your work done. (Or since your mom could take off day 2, she should\u2019ve taken off day 1). \n\nInstead she only took off the day of the funeral, thinking you (and your family) could sacrifice work for her work and family, and took none of the days off required to be with your mutual child while you\u2019ve taken 2.", "NTA\u2026.

It sounds like the kid has had to stay home from daycare for many days, so he doesn\u2019t just have a sniffle.\nEdit: to add that a sick child is a vulnerable and unhappy child. They are likely to be grizzly and more easily upset, and more in need of the emotional support of their primary caregivers. That\u2019s a lot to put on a sitter, and hard on a little kid, even for a short time.", "What parent leaves a sick toddler to be taken care of by a stranger?", "Until our kid got sick, i didn't need to stay home at the day of the funeral, if both kids could be in school/daycare then there would be no problem. But the sickness forced me to stay home, even though i had \"ekstra responsibility\" at the moment at work. I did it because my wife's seminar was important and i asked my mother to help out to make end meet, i guess i thought she would have prioritized the seminar if it was on the same day as the funeral.", "What they\u2019re saying is, did OP tell his wife 3 days prior to the funeral that he\u2019d only have 2 days off work and that\u2019s it? Or did he know and not say anything until the day of on purpose to force OPs wife to stay home (and not make other arrangements)? \n\nThat\u2019s why it feels like there\u2019s little support if the latter occurred (which is what it seems like based on the wife\u2019s reaction)", "That's kinda fucked up tbh, but thank you for telling me", "Baby sitter does not always equal stranger. I would be probably ask my mom, stepdad, siblings etc before hiring someone I don't know", "Right? I can\u2019t imagine doing it.", "Did you even ask your work?  Explain the situation?", ">I did it because my wife's seminar was important\n\nThe funeral was important too. You should have told her you couldn't cover both *before* the seminar and allowed her to choose which was most important *to her*, or allowed her to choose to seek other childcare for once. Blindsiding her by making the decision for her was your asshole move.", "Tbh if they live in the states then sometimes even having a great relationship with your bosses and being there a long time isn\u2019t enough to ensure stability there. It\u2019s really fucked up but sometimes you just have to have one day too many and it\u2019s damning in your bosses eyes. Way too much importance and focus on work coming above all else here and most employers want you to want to work yourself to your maximum capacity.", "I see he didn't reply to that."]}
