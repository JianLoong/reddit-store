At all! Remind her the guy who threw that fantastic party is a creep. And that she doesn\u2019t want to associate herself with those kinds of people, including you, a person she \u201clost respect for\u201d. I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re still friends with her.", "NTA. If Jess wants to talk shit about someone, it\u2019s a pretty safe assumption that she\u2019s not going to be invited or brought to their party. If she wants to have a problem with how Liam lives his life, that\u2019s fine, but her anger at you is more than a little bit hypocritical.", "NTA \nSo Jess is a hypocrite! She wants to criticize Liam\u2019s lifestyle but till get the benefits is partying at his expense. Also she was rude to you saying she lost respect for you, ok then why does she want to be invited. I wouldn\u2019t invite her to anything, even more now.", "INFO:\n\nDid you say what your reasons are for not inviting her?\n\nAlso,\n\n> Jess said that she lost respect for me, that I am friends with this guy. \n\nWho says this to a friend and expects to keep the friendship?", "NTA- Jess said she thought Liam was creepy. Honestly I would of dropped her as a friend for saying she lost all respect for me.", "NTA. This shows how shallow she really is. If she was really offended by Liam's lifestyle, she would've been glad you didn't insult her by inviting her to the debauchery aboard the yacht. Honestly, this should've made you lose all respect for her.", "NTA.  You were well within normal friend behavior to take her criticisms of the host as a permanent decline of all invitations to his events.", "NTA. None of her argument makes sense. She's the \"closer friend\" but has lost respect for you for being friends with this other guy. She finds the guy creepy but is upset she wasn't invited to his party. I would guess she got FOMO for missing the yacht party but 1) her party attendance isn't your responsibility and 2) she responded negatively when you brought her into this group in the past.", "Why would she want to get invited to a creepy guy's party? Are you sure she isn't mad at you for staying friends with said creepy guy rather than for not inviting her along?", "NTA. Liam can invite anyone he wants to his parties, which could include younger women, it is Miami after all and there are apparently many that enjoy going to rich guy's parties. \n\nYou are in a car club with the guy, he isn't Jeffrey Epstein. If Jess is so disappointed in you for knowing someone who has money, likes cars, is willing to spend my money on parties for many people he probably doesn't know, then she shouldn't be upset that sh wasn't invited.", "NTA. If she doesn't want to go hunting sugar daddies with you that's her business, but she can't blame you for not inviting her after being judgmental about it.", "NTA. Jess is a hypocritical user.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Why would she want to be around the same creep again?", "reachin a little hard bud", "You see when she said he was a creep what she really meant was that seeing women hotter than her at the party made her feel bad", "\u201cHey I did not want you losing more respect for me\u201d", "Nta\n\nI don't understand how that's super creepy.
