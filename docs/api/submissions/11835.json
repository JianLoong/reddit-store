At all! Remind her the guy who threw that fantastic party is a creep. And that she doesn\u2019t want to associate herself with those kinds of people, including you, a person she \u201clost respect for\u201d. I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re still friends with her.", "NTA. If Jess wants to talk shit about someone, it\u2019s a pretty safe assumption that she\u2019s not going to be invited or brought to their party. If she wants to have a problem with how Liam lives his life, that\u2019s fine, but her anger at you is more than a little bit hypocritical.", "NTA \nSo Jess is a hypocrite! She wants to criticize Liam\u2019s lifestyle but till get the benefits is partying at his expense. Also she was rude to you saying she lost respect for you, ok then why does she want to be invited.

Honestly I would of dropped her as a friend for saying she lost all respect for me.", "NTA. This shows how shallow she really is. If she was really offended by Liam's lifestyle, she would've been glad you didn't insult her by inviting her to the debauchery aboard the yacht. Honestly, this should've made you lose all respect for her.", "NTA.  You were well within normal friend behavior to take her criticisms of the host as a permanent decline of all invitations to his events.", "NTA. None of her argument makes sense. She's the \"closer friend\" but has lost respect for you for being friends with this other guy. She finds the guy creepy but is upset she wasn't invited to his party. I would guess she got FOMO for missing the yacht party but 1) her party attendance isn't your responsibility and 2) she responded negatively when you brought her into this group in the past.", "Why would she want to get invited to a creepy guy's party? Are you sure she isn't mad at you for staying friends with said creepy guy rather than for not inviting her along?", "NTA. Liam can invite anyone he wants to his parties, which could include younger women, it is Miami after all and there are apparently many that enjoy going to rich guy's parties. \n\nYou are in a car club with the guy, he isn't Jeffrey Epstein. If Jess is so disappointed in you for knowing someone who has money, likes cars, is willing to spend my money on parties for many people he probably doesn't know, then she shouldn't be upset that sh wasn't invited.", "NTA. If she doesn't want to go hunting sugar daddies with you that's her business, but she can't blame you for not inviting her after being judgmental about it.", "NTA.

Like I get the \"implications\" but if the idea is you get to come to this expensive fun party and as part of the deal you act like attractive arm candy....isnt that fine if everyone is adult and consenting?\n\nSo as long as no coercion or pressuring to have sex goes on (which op hasn't described. Just that the dude had lots of hot women on his arm) then it's fine", "She probably meant Liam Is a creep.", "NTA but Jess needs to get her own story straight. She lost respect for you for being around Liam, then she\u2019s mad when you don\u2019t invite her around Liam again???She obviously just wants to come to enjoy the $$$ aspect of the party itself but thinks the host is creepy\u2026. Yeah no, tell Jess to kick rocks! \u201cShe\u2019s really hurt\u201d my ass! You know what\u2019s really hurtful and fake?! shit talking someone behind their back and expecting to be invited to their parties", "That\u2019s the main thing I look for in a guest to a party: snide comments and a lack of respect for myself and the host/s\n\nShe just wanted to go to a party with famous people and a yacht- that\u2019s not bad because most people would want to check it out. However, she\u2019s a hypocrite to say she had lost respect for you for being friends with Liam but still vocalising that she still wants to go to the parties. Does that mean she has no respect for herself?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nJess finds him creepy, lost respect for you, but has no problem taking advantage of your friendship with Liam so she can go to fancy parties? Girl's shown her true colours.", "NTA. How old are you and your friends?", "NTA, \u201cJess said that she lost respect for me, that I am friends with this guy.\u201d and called him creepy for being in his 40\u2019s and having cheerleader (referring to nfl cheerleaders, usually 20\u2019s to 30\u2019s) age women at his party", "NTA. There is no contract that says you can only invite the same friend to parties. Also, why would you take Jess when she's told you she thinks less of you for being friends with Liam? \n\nIs it okay for the young ladies to be friends with Liam because it gives them access to nice things? Is that the same way Jess sees you? Someone who gives her access to nice things?", "NTA.  You brought Jess before to Liam's party previously but she only have bad things to say about the host.  It's a good decision to bring Liz with you and I think it's better if you cut ties with Jess. She feels entitled to be invited yet all she did when she was invited was to say bad things about the host.", "So Jess still considers herself a close friend, despite all this lack of respect she has for you now?

Jess is bad vibes...", "Then why would she want to go to his party?", "He's a creep because he showed attention to younger women and not her.\n\nNow if he's suddenly interested in her then he's ok.", "where does it say she wants liam's attention?\n\nit IS creepy that he has nothing but women half his age around. she just wanted to go to the cool party, that doesn't mean he's not a creep.", "You\u2019re right. That\u2019s an angle OP should look into.", "INFO is Liam a creep? Was there a mix of ages of both sexes, or were the men mostly older and the women mostly much younger?", "NTA Jess criticized your character for just being friends/acquaintances with Liam, there's no reason for you to invite her to another of his parties. Sounds like she wants to act indignant about Liam's lifestyle while she tries to enjoy it herself.", "NTA - honestly the only way i think you could reconcile her initial comments with an apparent desire to have attended the yacht party is if she has a problem with Liz, or more specifically with you hanging out with Liz. She feels she can\u2019t admit this so would perhaps rather cop to seeming like a bit of a hypocrite, and make it about the yacht party.", "Basically, \u201cthis guy is a creep but I will still hangout with him in order to go to fancy parties. And then I\u2019ll talk shit about him behind his back\u201d.", "Yeah, this just means her integrity has a price. He IS a creep, but she's willing to overlook it for a fancy party.", "Info: Can you elaborate about what Jess said in regards to Liam being creepy? \n\nFirstly, it's clearly hypocritical that Jess would call him creepy then still want an invite. But at the same time, creepy dudes are real and the men who don't notice, ignore or support their predatory behaviour are just as real, and it sucks for women to always have to bear the consequences as friends refuse to step up.

No reasons are needed.", "Pretty sure she's mad that she didn't get to go to a cool party, and knows she did herself out of it which made her more mad. How was OP supposed to know she would abandon her principles easily, when she used them to state she had no respect for him?", "It does to a point where Jess should know it's her own fault she didn't get invited. She is friends with OP, so it's better if she knows what's really going on rather than her thinking OP is just a shitty friend.\n\nBut for the most part, NTA.", "Okay, that's fair. I thought you were thinking that his reason for not inviting her would affect your judgement, which I don't agree with.", "Because he's a rich creep that can be benefitted from. This doesn't make him any less creepy, it just makes people look past the creepiness without telling him he's creepy. \n\nYou'd be surprised what you can get away with when you're able and willing to make it rain.", "Or because he's Jeffrey Epstein.", "NTA - Jess wants status no matter what, clearly, and that includes going to the \u201cin crowd\u201d parties .. she probably didn\u2019t find the guy creepy per se but more annoyed that he was surrounded by \u201cbeautiful\u201d ppl and she wasn\u2019t one of them \u2026 otherwise why would she be annoyed at missing the next party \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "She's a hypocrite. She wants to go to the party for the same reason those women in their twenties want to go: to party with rich people and celebrities. And it's not like Liam and guys like him are unaware of that. I mean, some guys may fool themselves into thinking that those younger women would still want them even if they had no money or connections, but most of those guys use that money and connections to their advantage. It's not something I necessarily approve of, but I don't get upset about it like your friend does. NTA", "NTA. Remind Jess that she thinks Liam is a creep. AND she was taken to a party like this, not on a yacht, but at a mansion. Would Liam be less creepy on a yacht?", "NTA", "\"I lost respect for you because you're friends with Liam but that doesn't mean you shouldn't invite me to his parties!\"\n\nNTA, Jess doesn't get to judge you for being friends with Liam and still expect to reap the benefits.", "NTA\n\nJess can sit right down. She made her views clear, no kidding she's not invited to someone she decided to disparage. She's entitled to her opinion and you're entitled to not be TA who brings a hater to a party. It's transparent AF that she is mad she didn't get to go and benefit from your friendship when she doesn't like your friend. Anyhow don't feel bad at all. Tell her YOU lost respect for her after this interaction, she sounds like a user.", "NTA.\n\nUm respond with\n\n\u201cWhy would I put you in an uncomfortable situation like last time? You clearly were creeped out by the guy whose lifestyle you have a problem with. And you even lost respect for me. Or does that not matter at all? You are just a user.

Please tell us that you told Jess that being a hypocrite makes you lose respect for her", "She made her bed, so to speak.

If a forty year old man only has twenty year old girls at his party, that's certainly a reason to raise an eyebrow or five.", "Its a very Miami situation. Lots of people who live there are image concious and only want to be seen at a high profile party with nfl players", "Op didnt say that all the women there where young."]}
