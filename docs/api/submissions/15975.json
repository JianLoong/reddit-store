I countered that opinions from non-medical professionals don't really count for much, and that he could just have social anxiety he does not know how to manage, and that it sounds more like he wants to claim an explanation for himself that I feel should really be left to professionals.\n\nHis argument was that I was discounting his experiences, and that it \"was obvious\" that he is neurodivergent. My thoughts on the matter is that it is very reckless of him to claim a real condition for himself that he may or may not have without confirmation from a medical professional, because I feel that the possibility of someone claiming to be something they are not can have real, if overall tiny, effects on the perception of the people who really do have the condition if they take his word about being neurodivergent at face value.

And it\u2019s a combination of negative and positive symptoms. Like you can be afraid of dogs and cross the street and you can be so afraid of dogs you have a panic response, start sweating, trying not to cry, step into the street to wait for the dog to pass. One person is managing their fear intentionally, and the other person cannot mount a response, the being frozen and inability to respond, is also a symptom.\n\nSelf diagnosing is important to identify when to seek help and get a professional opinion. It\u2019s good he\u2019s thinking about it and if he\u2019s struggling in aspects of his life where he feels frozen or like he\u2019s struggling he should absolutely get help.

Especially as adults. In fact, it can be almost impossible for an adult to get a diagnosis, even in the West. I'm ADHD, and I only figured it out when my kid (who seemed perfectly normal to me) was given a diagnosis based on behaviors he and I share. \n\nChances are good that your brother is right. \n\nAnd it's not a serious \"psychological condition\" like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. It's really the equivalent of being left-handed in a right-handed world. Once they get simple accommodations, many neurodivergent people thrive.  \n\nBut if folks are (proverbially) tying your left hand behind your back and slapping you with a ruler when you try to do things in the way that comes naturally, you are going to develop anxiety. \n\nYour brother is saying that he needs the social equivalent of left-handed scissors, and he needs people to accept his slightly unusual way of relating to others. If you do that, he will be happier and more able to be close to you. \n\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nFrom my point of view: I also tought I had conditions before I realized that was not the case. Sometimes symptoms can align with you, but that doesn't mean you have something.\n\nFor example, you can have a sore throat, but it can be a simple flu, or your may need to check with your dentist. Or your throat is acting up if you scratch it while swallowing, for example, popcorn, breadsticks, etc.\n\nNot to invalidate your brother, ofc. But he better check with a professional for these conditions. If he is correct, he can get help and become better. If he is wrong, he will focus on what is causing him to be this way, and if he doesn't like his behaviors, he can change it.", "NTA. It's understandable that your brother may be struggling with social anxiety or other issues, but it's not appropriate for him to self-diagnose as neurodivergent without consulting a medical professional. Doing so could potentially undermine the experiences of those who have been diagnosed with the condition by a professional. It's important to encourage your brother to seek out a proper diagnosis if he is concerned about his mental health, and to not rely on self-diagnosis. However, it's also important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and to avoid dismissing his experiences entirely.", "I\u2019m going to go NAH. Take different mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. There are pretty good tests that anyone can do - PHQ-9, GAD7 - to test for this. They\u2019re not infallible but they are clinical tests you can undertake without ever speaking to a medical professional. So with the right bit of reading, your brother might genuinely be on to something and believe based on his experience and what he\u2019s read, that he is neurodivergent. His view is unlikely to have any legal standing but beyond his conversation with you, you\u2019ve not indicated any attempt to use the diagnosis to personal benefit. And in your case, you\u2019ve a healthy dose of scepticism, nothing wrong with that, but perhaps err a little more on the side of acceptance unless/until brother starts trying to use their self-diagnosis as a reason to excuse poor behaviour.", "NAH: OP, Your brother has found a frame of reference to describe some of his experience. If it helps him find ways to cope with feelings he is uncomfortable with, that could be useful. You are correct; he may or may not fit the criteria for a specific \"diagnosis\".  Some people may judge your brother negatively if he shares his \"diagnosis\" with friends, others may not. It is your brother's life!", "NTA.  Your brother claiming to suffer from conditions he's never been diagnosed with is wrong.  He's kind of belittling the experiences of folks who actually suffering from these conditions by claiming them as his own just because he feels like it.  \n\nIf he is concerned about it, he should go to a doctor and get diagnosed.  If he does indeed have the conditions, he could then get treated.\n\nIt's obviously not the same thing, but what your brother is doing is the medical equivalent of someone claiming false honor/stolen valor.  And he's probably doing it for the same reasons too: to try to get benefits, sympathy, and/or pity.", "NTA.   \nIt's wrong for your brother to present himself with medical conditions he's never been diagnosed with. If this was a physical condition, then there would be no debate. For example, I have a mole on my shoulder someone once told me I should get looked at. I haven't gotten around to it yet. Should I go around telling everyone I'm a cancer patient? Of course not. This is basically what your brother is doing. He has a suspicion that he has a condition but has never seen a doctor for it. He's an AH for telling people he suffers from a condition that he doesn't. It belittles the experience for people who really are diagnosed with those issues.", "NTA. Your brother is wrong, but if it's not affecting you in any way then you should leave it alone.", "Yes YTA. Self identification or diagnosis is accepted in a lot of communities and, I am guessing, the one your brother is a part of. I don't see how this could cause a problem. Doctors generally ask about history of DX and make their own judgements based on their experience of the patient alongside medical history. Therapists do the same with clients. Presumably, he knows he can't force the issue with accomodations under the law without a diagnosis but he doesn't seem interested in that. \n\nWe could talk all day about how wrong it is that books designed to generate billing codes has taken over our understanding of human interaction and internal states, but they have and people have had to form communities and come to an understanding of themselves in that context. Trust me, if he's wrong his community will almost certainly figure it out and point him in the right direction. If he's manipulating or malingering they will destroy him from the inside out in a way that may shock you.\n\nEdited: I forget that so many people forget or don't know that an official diagnosis can affect one's rights under the law. For example, do you know how many countries flat out won't take disabled immigrants? Autistic people, even like engineers and otherwise desirable professionals aren't welcome in many countries. Did you see the other day a right wing media person on Twitter asking if folks thought \"mentally ill\" people should be able to vote? The majority of respondents said no. An old diagnosis can come up in a divorce or lawsuit and it will affect the outcome. There are reasons to avoid a paper trail.", "Slight YTA. You\u2019re not wrong about people potentially misdiagnosing themselves, but the solution to your brother telling you he thinks he has mental health issues is indeed to encourage him to get diagnosed, instead of telling him he may simply be misdiagnosing himself. The latter is equivalent to dismissing what he views as a helpful way to understand the problems he has been facing.", "YTA - self diagnosis is important esp for ND people to be able to acknowledge their experiences and if they need medication or supports it\u2019s the first step in those things. Do you not think that people acknowledge something feeling off before they go to a professional? Him being in his teens and realizing how much of his life has been hard and he feels different and people don\u2019t understand him to then have someone so close to him basically tell him it\u2019s all invalid would be super hurtful. He was confiding in you which is extra important considering you said mental illness is less focused on where you are from. \n\nDoctors validations are not the be all and end all for personal experience being valid and worth listening to.", "YTA\n\nIf someone self diagnoses with some form of neurodivergency, do you know what they generally do? They research coping mechanisms and try and apply them to their lives. Coping mechanisms are not dangerous, and they can provide huge benefits to people who are neurodivergent (hell, they can even benefit people who are neurotypical). A self diagnosis cannot do any real damage to him unless he attempts to self medicate.\n\nAs a minor, he's not in a position to self-advocate with doctors and it can take a period of **YEARS** for doctors to get around to confirming a neurodivergent diagnosis that's obvious to the individual. On top of that, some general practice doctors are advised against diagnosing people with certain conditions and instead refer people to specialist clinics with long wait times.\n\nYour brother might be wrong about his diagnosis (he might even have a *different* neurodivergency) but demanding that he have slip of paper to confirm his diagnosis to you just means that he's not going to seek out help and advice from you in future, it's not going to help him.", "YTA for not being supportive of your brother. He opened up to you and said he thought he had issues. Instead of talking with him about them or encouraging him to get professional help to understand them and control them, you told him he couldn't be right.\n\nThis was a lost opportunity. Go back and apologize. Ask him if he's looked for help and if not, tell him you'll help him find it.", "ESH. I fully agree with you that someone claiming they have a mental health issue without having ever been diagnosed or even seeing a doctor about it is a terrible trend that seems to be getting more popular lately... *However* this is one of those scenarios where you have to ask yourself \"would I rather be technically correct, or would I rather support my family\", because it is impossible to do both in this situation. \n\nYour brother clearly is having a tough time with something and has grasped onto a self diagnosis of being \"neurodivergent\" as a way to try and understand what he's going through. Just telling him he's wrong is dismissing his very serious concerns completely, and is basically telling him that he's an idiot, which can't be good for the self esteem of a frightened teenager who's already dealing with some issues... Just try to be supportive and keep encouraging him to maybe see a therapist if whatever is bothering him is really making it difficult for him to just live day to day.\n\nEdit: judging by the downvotes I've apparently offended someone. It seems the Reddit hive mind believes that any medical condition anyone has ever claimed to have or not have has and will always be valid regardless of anything any doctor may or may not have said or not said. It seems doctors are now considered completely unnecessary when diagnosing serious mental health concerns lol\n\nHave fun with that I guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NAH.  This is above reddit's paygrade / outside the scope of what can be easily discussed in a post.\n\nEither side could be true.  If he does not have actual access to proper medical care, how is he going to get diagnosed?\n\nOTOH, simply stating he has an issue and trying to use it as an excuse, isn't helping anything either.\n\nAssuming you care about your brother - the best thing to do here is to figure out how to get him to see a doctor, to figure out one way or the other.  That way, if he does have issues, he can get help.  And if he doesn't - he can start to move past and address the actual causes of his problems.", "Yta. Firstly, you're a hypocrite. You say he can't tell you he's nd then say it's probably social anxiety. You are also not a professional. Secondly, he knows himself better than you. And thirdly, diagnosis of any nd can be incredibly difficult to get. Your brother has discovered something about himself he wanted to share with you. Not sure he'll make that mistake again.", "I'm going with a soft YTA because you acknowledge that good care is hard to get in your country. It makes sense that he is searching for answers after feeling for a long time that he's different. You're also not a doctor but seem quick to assume he just has social anxiety instead of something else. Sounds like he's just looking for solutions and coping mechanisms, not spouting off on social media for attention.", "YTA\n\nEven if he \u201conly has social anxiety\u201d he\u2019s still neurodivergent.

Why? \n\nYou can get conservatorship over someone if they\u2019re diagnosed autistic. Certain countries don\u2019t allow visas to autistic folks. The assessment is expensive. An autism diagnosis can prevent certain non-necessary medical treatments because you can be viewed as medically unwell enough to make that decision. Autistic people are disqualified from military service (I mean, I have no interest in the military but others do). Custody claims can be damaged by your autism diagnosis. You can be denied organ transplants. Also people treat autistic folks like literal children. \n\nThe benefits of getting a diagnosis(for me)?

As you admit you yourself don\u2019t know where to start to get a diagnosis and that your country has a low knowledge of mental health conditions so maybe coming from a place of understanding would be more helpful here instead of shutting down his feelings. Why don\u2019t you help him see a professional? Why don\u2019t you help get him the help he feels he needs? If he is actually ND then he will have even more of a struggle than you would finding help.

In some cases, it's because they were neglected in their youth, and many people feel embarrassed, scared, and anxious about being diagnose when they are adult. \n\nAnd if you look carefully, you'll find that it's not easy for him to open up to you and tell you about it. So, even if you tell him that with good intentions But telling that is like you don't believe in his judgment.

Here in Canada, a lot of people are diagnosed late in life or have to rely on deep reflection and self-diagnosis because of lack of resources.

Most people I know who are autistic including me (I have since then been officially diagnosed) have spent months and months researching it. \n\nA self diagnosis for neurodivergence does no harm. It's the reason the autism community are very vocal in support of self diagnoses.Undiagnosed neurodivergence actually tends to do. Spending the first 40 years of my life undiagnosed, believe me, had caused trauma because of how people treated my symptoms. If self diagnosis helps him, why are you judging?

Most of them turned out nurodivergent and the weird character were part of the coping mechanisms or delusions, others thought it was fun and were just buying into what I can only call an analogue arg. \n\n10 years later it was popularly called \"kinning\" and the community would *dominate* some apps and certain communities.\n\nNow it's being applied to DID, I think because it adds a layer of protection with the medical term. \"You can't make fun of me or tell me I'm wrong or need to grow up because its *medical*\". Some of them might turn out to have DID, but mostly likely as they get older they will probably realize have other nurodicergencies or mental illnesses that they were coping with or they just needed to be allowed to play imagination games and be creative past the age where it was assumed they were too old to do so.\n\nAll in all it's the same shit some of my friends did when we were 15, but the internet has allowed it to span beyond \"other wierd kids in my school\".", "Not entirly sure what you're saying , but my point still stands, the boy is a teen in the story", "Well that\u2019s not a fair comparison, If my friend said that they\u2019ve torn their ACL without seeking a medical professional then no I would not believe them", "i agree that those are good options for people who can access them. you're right, learning where to look is a huge obstacle for a lot of people. I do think it's important to try and seek help, but i also think the reasons that many neurodivergent people DON'T seek help are also valid (discrimination once having a diagnosis being a huge one).\n\n I also am very curious why you believe that people who self diagnose are convincing themselves that they're broken and unfixable? (unless i misunderstood you) because in my experience it's actually the quite opposite. i know many people who did the research (NOT just tiktok) and used the information they found to help themselves develop coping mechanisms, find community, access to healhcare(!!), and genuinely understand themselves to the point what they realize they're NOT broken and that there's people like them who understand their pain and isolation in a world built for neurotypical people.", "No, I said people will self diagnose so they can feel better or feel like they are special when in fact they are ordinary.

We lived overseas and psychiatric care for us was hit or miss. We had good doctors and pretty awful ones. We had no insurance and times of joblessness so it wasn\u2019t affordable before we had the stability to get even the first diagnosis.

Neurodivergent is not a diagnosis.  It's literally just saying your brain works differently.

No one in my biological family has ever once seen a mental health professional so there was no chance of that happening as a child. But I\u2019ve always known there\u2019s something different about how my brain works and that I needed to cover it to make it acceptable to others. It was exhausting but became my default setting.\n\nWhen my stepson was diagnosed with ADHD, I started to learn more about it and I never expected for it to rock my own self-view at such a core level. Reading about neurodivergence is the first time I\u2019ve ever read my own personal internal struggles that I never shared with anyone explained outside of my own head. Things I never thought anyone would understand are outlined in articles as indicators. They even shown up in screening tests. When I read about common traits of women late diagnosed with autism it was like someone was reading my innermost thoughts. \n\nSo now I feel strongly on a fundamental level that I\u2019m neurodivergent in some way. I don\u2019t know or claim a specific diagnosis, but there\u2019s just too much that fits to ignore it.

I feel vulnerable, both that people won\u2019t believe me and that they will. There\u2019s dread to both scenarios. I\u2019ve barely talked about it with anyone. I\u2019m in my 30s, so because of my age I also feel like \u2018damn how much easier could things have been if I had had these strategies earlier\u2019 I also recognize I could be wrong about it.\n\nI think we\u2019re in an awkward growing pain where the awareness and research about mental health and neurodivergence is more accessible and advancing faster than the diagnostics and administration of them can currently keep up.

I must have ADHD,\" when really they just don't clean their room because they don't like cleaning and are a normal level of forgetful.\n\nMeanwhile when adults self-diagnose, it's more like they identify a pattern of behaviour over years where they struggled and didn't understand why everything was so hard or that it wasn't normal and like that for everyone.\n\nI personally think that self-diagnosis can be harmful. If someone doesn't have a disorder is claiming they do, then they set up false expectations for people with the actual disorder. Mental health is poorly understood, and they perpetuate misunderstandings.\n\nI also think self-diagnosis can be helpful. Once you have realized you potentially have an issue you can better learn how to manage it, even without professional help.\n\nI personally think that if you self-diagnose you shouldn't say  \"I have \\[disorder\\],\" but rather, \"I suspect I have \\[disorder\\]\" if you even have to bring it up at all.", "That's not a medical term, so, really he just proclaimed himself to be different from others.", " then they are a different and special and in need of special attention- has become a big problem.", "I had to fight tooth and nail to get my diagnosis for ADHD.

It does depend on the situation I'm afraid, as there are so many specifics, but for a general answer I'd say: You don't know what your brother fully experience(d/s), especially due to neurodivergent folks commonly masking to fit in. He could have hidden many symptoms that only he'd know he has. He knows himself best, and if he's not pretending to be diagnosed/will not admit that there is a possibility it's something else (possibility is the key word here, there is a difference in \"I very much think I have this\" vs. \"I definitely have this\")/using it as an excuse to be an ass rather than an explanation as to why he may act a certain way **(explaining, not excusing)**, then it's not your place to say whether or not he can identify with a term that matches his experiences.\n\nalso I just had to point out that **neuro**divergency is neurological rather that psychological, doesn't really matter but I had to say it for the peace of mind lol.\n\nalso also I've seen a few commenters brining up how Self Diagnosing is an important step in the process of getting an official diagnosis, as someone who is studying to go into the mental health field, yes!

Your brother clearly struggles and wants to communicate that to you, in which case, I think shutting him down wasn't the move. I understand where you were coming from though. I think supporting him in seeking diagnosis is your best move here, and recognising what he knows he deals with, even without using a diagnostic label. Like trying to help your friend if they're feeling unwell, despite not knowing why. If he doesn't want your support in that direction then there isn't much you can do, but that's where I would start personally.", "I mean it really depends on how deep his reasoning is and how difficult and stigmatized access ro mental health is where you live. Also I am in a western country and in my experience therapists and psychiatrist are really not concerned about giving you an ironclad diagnosis especially more complex ones that are included in neurodivergence. They kind of just treat you and see how you respond, they might sometimes let some vague indication of a *possible* diagnosis slide but nothing more. It would be bizarre to go to a therapist where I am to simply get a diagnosis (rather than get help with the symptoms) and it would certainly not be a one or two appointment affair and you would have to specifically ask for a formal diagnosis. But this can change a lot, for instance in the US, they throw lables a lot more and as I understand they need to give provisional diagnosis after like one session for insurance purposes. It's just very different.\n\nHaving said all that, I don't imagine myself saying I am certain I have a diagnosis I was not given but I could imagine discussing with someone close to me that I think I might have x, especially if I had no access to mental health.\n\nIt might also just help him explain hiw he feels in certain situations and he might feel you are invalidating his *symptoms*. I understand what you were doing but he probably took it as an invalidation of his feelings and symptoms. NAH.", "YTA, self diagnose is the first step to getting help, and being dismissive of someone's experiences is what keeps us from getting said help. I was only diagnosed at 38, scoring a 9/9 on both ADHD spectrums. And still I have that little voice in my head that I am just lazy or dumb, when someone makes a dismissive comment.", "NTA. Only professionals truly know. An example is the pros who have tons of people come in self diagnosed a lot of them are wrong. A simple google search and you could slowly develop self-diagnosed cancer.", "YTA. I was in your brother's shoes last year, and you are incredibly insensitive and dismissal of his feelings. You have no idea how it feels to think something is wrong with you all your life, then FINALLY realize (after reading online) that, no, you're not broken, you have a legitimate medical issue. And you also have no idea what it's like to have to to multiple \"experts\" who can't agree on a diagnosis or are reluctant to give one.

YTA, and you ow him an apology.", "YTA\n\n\nAnother thing I want to add to what other people are saying is that doctors can be ignorant about mental health and misdiagnose. Their word isn't the be all end all. For example, women were under-diagnosed for autism for ages.\n\n\nWhen I went to my GP because I thought I had depression, she told me it didn't sound like depression because depressed people were sad all the time, it felt very dismissive to shut down the idea after 10 minutes and kind of ignorant because I've spoken to depressed people who described their depression as being a lack of joy at anything more so than being sad.\n\n\nA lot of people with diagnoses went through a stage like your brother where they self diagnosed. Instead of telling him he shouldn't self-diagnose, and trying to invalidate what he is saying encourage him to see a doctor for his sake.", "NAH\n\nI understand your point, however your approach should have been to help your brother seek out a diagnosis rather than dismissing his thoughts and emotions. Even if it's not what he thinks it is, it still might help him understand why he feels different from his peers.\n\nI do, however, appreciate the irony if you saying it might just be social anxiety based on your non-medical observations.", "NAH surely? We haven\u2019t heard the reasons the brother thinks he is neurodivergent, or the examples. He might well be, and be at the end of the spectrum where it wasn\u2019t referred to medical professionals. Or he might be reading too much into things. If the only answer is \u201cno, you are wrong\u201d he will continue to believe it (rightly or wrongly) and will feel unsupported and hurt\n\nI don\u2019t think worrying you are neurodivergent makes you an AH. He\u2019s not demanding anything, just talking about his worries and perceived symptoms to his brother. He could be right, he could be wrong.

Neurodivergence has become a very popular diagnosis both medically diagnosed and self diagnosed. Is a more common thing? Or just more diagnosed? Or more media based? Just curious. I feel bad for anyone medically diagnosed with it.", "Yes! Teenagers especially sometimes do this to feel different or special, which is what I think your brother is doing, especially since he got all huffy about it. If he really thinks he has a condition then he should have no problem talking to a professional about it and getting an actual diagnosis. NTA.", "Have ADHD, diagnosed and all, and agreed on all counts. Those symptom lists often talk about nonsensical things as 'proof' that the reader has a neurodivergent condition. Like one I saw listed certain preferred sleep positions as 'proof' someone had ADHD. \ud83d\udc80\n\nWhile broader mental health awareness is great and all, these kinds of half-assed awareness campaigns make it harder for people with these conditions to seek help. Like the whole fake Tourettes craze on Tiktok awhile back. It gives people unrealistic expectations for what it means to be neurodivergent and can prevent them from actually seeking help. Because 'the internet knows better'. \n\nOf course on the flip side, it can also help people get diagnosed. So it depends on a situation by situation basis.\n\nOP, I'd encourage your brother again to get a proper diagnosis. If he does have a condition then he could get proper resources to help manage it.", "They say you need to be impaired in order to have it, but I functioned just fine with my now diagnosed ADHD (by intellect, coping mechanisms, having a family that retrospectively is ADHD and thus is very chaos positive lmao), until my pregnancy hormones got out of whack. Does that mean I didn't have ADHD before? No, I did, I just functioned differently and managed, I never just realized why some things were so difficult or tough for me, and knowing why explained so much. And now life is better knowing and getting the right help was great.", "My wife, after years of struggling with drug resistant anxiety and depression, \u201cself diagnosed\u201d herself with ADHD. After that we got her into a specialized clinic where an actual doctor who specializes in neurodivergent patients officially diagnosed her. She was put on a very low dose of Vyvanse and she is a million times better. The initial visits cost us upwards of 1,000$. The required monthly dr visit (due to Vyvanse being a controlled substance) + the prescription costs us another ~150$ a month. We are lucky we can afford it but you are 100% correct in bringing up that this type of treatment is out of the question for the vast majority of people who need it.", "Well said! I\u2019ve an 8 year old daughter, who I suspected form age 2 was autistic. By age three I knew (4 hour meltdown because her Velcro wasn\u2019t straight added to many many other behaviours and traits) and started seeking help. \n\nI contacted the GP they told me to speak to the health visitor. HV basically refused to refer her for assessments: she wasn\u2019t like other autistics - males?

He then referred her for assessment. Three years of waiting on the list, at aged 7 she got assessed and diagnosed with autism.  In the five years between suspecting and being diagnosed, the internet was all I had to help her and our family, and trust me the professionals were useless. \n\nAfter going through the assessments with her, I suspect I may be too. But I\u2019m in my 40s now, successful and I would probably be on the list until I retire. Now I don\u2019t call my self autistic but you bet I\u2019ve identified difficulties, and read up on coping and actioned some strategies for myself. \n\nMy point is, for some, self identification is all there is. That said, I\u2019m aware of the tic toc trend, and while it\u2019s worrying, I don\u2019t think kids would sustain the trend for long, and certainly not once the next trend came along. \n\nI not sure if op is the AH or not. Maybe just ignorant. Don\u2019t know if the brother is ND or not, but to completely discount self diagnosis is not right either.", "Despite having textbook ADHD symptoms, because I was a smart girl I was clearly was just bored because the work was too easy. I routinely got given harder work or was graded to a higher standard so I would feel motivated to \"apply\" myself, then punished when it didn't work because clearly I was just being \"lazy\".\n\nI'd rather 100 kids claim to be ADHD when they arn't then 1 other kid have to go through what I did.", "Or attribute it to something else entirely. I brought up wanting to get some testing done because I suspected I was ND and my primary care doctor (who I needed a referral from) told me I was likely just experiencing a change of life due to my age.

They sound like the OP.", "Actually, it can be incredibly difficult to get a diagnosis, especially if, like OP said, they're in a country where mental health awareness isn't great. Even in a first-world country, you can't just turn up and get a diagnosis. You have to get someone to refer you, then you normally end up on years-long waiting lists. There are also a lot of 'professionals' who hold outdated ideas about these conditions, which just makes it more difficult. \n\nStudies have found that the majority of people who self-diagnose are correct about themselves. Yes, you'll get a few people who have watched 5 minutes of content on TikTok and just want attention, but most self-diagnosed people have done a lot of more in-depth reading and aren't coming to this conclusion randomly. \n\nI'd say YTA here because it sounds like OP immediately started dismissing their brother without really trying to understand why he thinks he's ND.", "> The significant majority of our community is accepting to self diagnoses and welcome them in our community\n\nThis is false, i have seen the exact opposite.\n\n> Doing so could potentially undermine the experiences of those who have been diagnosed with the condition by a professional.\n\nThis is exactly how many feel, stop invalidating experiences because you don't believe them.", "After I started taking aderall I mentioned itnto my aunt and explained what it helped me with and she said, and i quote, \"mother FUCKER\" as she realized those were things she had been trying to find a solution for all her life.", "So then when someone goes \"ugh, why are you wearing earplugs at this loud and chaotic restaurant that I peer pressured you into going to?
