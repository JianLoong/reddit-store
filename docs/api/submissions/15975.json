I countered that opinions from non-medical professionals don't really count for much, and that he could just have social anxiety he does not know how to manage, and that it sounds more like he wants to claim an explanation for himself that I feel should really be left to professionals.\n\nHis argument was that I was discounting his experiences, and that it \"was obvious\" that he is neurodivergent. My thoughts on the matter is that it is very reckless of him to claim a real condition for himself that he may or may not have without confirmation from a medical professional, because I feel that the possibility of someone claiming to be something they are not can have real, if overall tiny, effects on the perception of the people who really do have the condition if they take his word about being neurodivergent at face value.

And it\u2019s a combination of negative and positive symptoms. Like you can be afraid of dogs and cross the street and you can be so afraid of dogs you have a panic response, start sweating, trying not to cry, step into the street to wait for the dog to pass. One person is managing their fear intentionally, and the other person cannot mount a response, the being frozen and inability to respond, is also a symptom.\n\nSelf diagnosing is important to identify when to seek help and get a professional opinion. It\u2019s good he\u2019s thinking about it and if he\u2019s struggling in aspects of his life where he feels frozen or like he\u2019s struggling he should absolutely get help.

Especially as adults. In fact, it can be almost impossible for an adult to get a diagnosis, even in the West. I'm ADHD, and I only figured it out when my kid (who seemed perfectly normal to me) was given a diagnosis based on behaviors he and I share. \n\nChances are good that your brother is right. \n\nAnd it's not a serious \"psychological condition\" like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. It's really the equivalent of being left-handed in a right-handed world. Once they get simple accommodations, many neurodivergent people thrive.  \n\nBut if folks are (proverbially) tying your left hand behind your back and slapping you with a ruler when you try to do things in the way that comes naturally, you are going to develop anxiety. \n\nYour brother is saying that he needs the social equivalent of left-handed scissors, and he needs people to accept his slightly unusual way of relating to others. If you do that, he will be happier and more able to be close to you. \n\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nFrom my point of view: I also tought I had conditions before I realized that was not the case. Sometimes symptoms can align with you, but that doesn't mean you have something.\n\nFor example, you can have a sore throat, but it can be a simple flu, or your may need to check with your dentist. Or your throat is acting up if you scratch it while swallowing, for example, popcorn, breadsticks, etc.\n\nNot to invalidate your brother, ofc. But he better check with a professional for these conditions. If he is correct, he can get help and become better. If he is wrong, he will focus on what is causing him to be this way, and if he doesn't like his behaviors, he can change it.", "NTA. It's understandable that your brother may be struggling with social anxiety or other issues, but it's not appropriate for him to self-diagnose as neurodivergent without consulting a medical professional. Doing so could potentially undermine the experiences of those who have been diagnosed with the condition by a professional. It's important to encourage your brother to seek out a proper diagnosis if he is concerned about his mental health, and to not rely on self-diagnosis. However, it's also important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and to avoid dismissing his experiences entirely.", "I\u2019m going to go NAH. Take different mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. There are pretty good tests that anyone can do - PHQ-9, GAD7 - to test for this. They\u2019re not infallible but they are clinical tests you can undertake without ever speaking to a medical professional. So with the right bit of reading, your brother might genuinely be on to something and believe based on his experience and what he\u2019s read, that he is neurodivergent. His view is unlikely to have any legal standing but beyond his conversation with you, you\u2019ve not indicated any attempt to use the diagnosis to personal benefit. And in your case, you\u2019ve a healthy dose of scepticism, nothing wrong with that, but perhaps err a little more on the side of acceptance unless/until brother starts trying to use their self-diagnosis as a reason to excuse poor behaviour.", "NAH: OP, Your brother has found a frame of reference to describe some of his experience. If it helps him find ways to cope with feelings he is uncomfortable with, that could be useful. You are correct; he may or may not fit the criteria for a specific \"diagnosis\".  Some people may judge your brother negatively if he shares his \"diagnosis\" with friends, others may not. It is your brother's life!", "NTA.  Your brother claiming to suffer from conditions he's never been diagnosed with is wrong.  He's kind of belittling the experiences of folks who actually suffering from these conditions by claiming them as his own just because he feels like it.  \n\nIf he is concerned about it, he should go to a doctor and get diagnosed.  If he does indeed have the conditions, he could then get treated.\n\nIt's obviously not the same thing, but what your brother is doing is the medical equivalent of someone claiming false honor/stolen valor.  And he's probably doing it for the same reasons too: to try to get benefits, sympathy, and/or pity.", "NTA.   \nIt's wrong for your brother to present himself with medical conditions he's never been diagnosed with. If this was a physical condition, then there would be no debate. For example, I have a mole on my shoulder someone once told me I should get looked at. I haven't gotten around to it yet. Should I go around telling everyone I'm a cancer patient? Of course not. This is basically what your brother is doing. He has a suspicion that he has a condition but has never seen a doctor for it. He's an AH for telling people he suffers from a condition that he doesn't. It belittles the experience for people who really are diagnosed with those issues.", "NTA. Your brother is wrong, but if it's not affecting you in any way then you should leave it alone.", "Yes YTA. Self identification or diagnosis is accepted in a lot of communities and, I am guessing, the one your brother is a part of. I don't see how this could cause a problem. Doctors generally ask about history of DX and make their own judgements based on their experience of the patient alongside medical history. Therapists do the same with clients. Presumably, he knows he can't force the issue with accomodations under the law without a diagnosis but he doesn't seem interested in that. \n\nWe could talk all day about how wrong it is that books designed to generate billing codes has taken over our understanding of human interaction and internal states, but they have and people have had to form communities and come to an understanding of themselves in that context. Trust me, if he's wrong his community will almost certainly figure it out and point him in the right direction. If he's manipulating or malingering they will destroy him from the inside out in a way that may shock you.\n\nEdited: I forget that so many people forget or don't know that an official diagnosis can affect one's rights under the law. For example, do you know how many countries flat out won't take disabled immigrants? Autistic people, even like engineers and otherwise desirable professionals aren't welcome in many countries. Did you see the other day a right wing media person on Twitter asking if folks thought \"mentally ill\" people should be able to vote? The majority of respondents said no. An old diagnosis can come up in a divorce or lawsuit and it will affect the outcome. There are reasons to avoid a paper trail.", "Slight YTA. You\u2019re not wrong about people potentially misdiagnosing themselves, but the solution to your brother telling you he thinks he has mental health issues is indeed to encourage him to get diagnosed, instead of telling him he may simply be misdiagnosing himself. The latter is equivalent to dismissing what he views as a helpful way to understand the problems he has been facing.", "YTA - self diagnosis is important esp for ND people to be able to acknowledge their experiences and if they need medication or supports it\u2019s the first step in those things. Do you not think that people acknowledge something feeling off before they go to a professional? Him being in his teens and realizing how much of his life has been hard and he feels different and people don\u2019t understand him to then have someone so close to him basically tell him it\u2019s all invalid would be super hurtful. He was confiding in you which is extra important considering you said mental illness is less focused on where you are from. \n\nDoctors validations are not the be all and end all for personal experience being valid and worth listening to.", "YTA\n\nIf someone self diagnoses with some form of neurodivergency, do you know what they generally do? They research coping mechanisms and try and apply them to their lives. Coping mechanisms are not dangerous, and they can provide huge benefits to people who are neurodivergent (hell, they can even benefit people who are neurotypical). A self diagnosis cannot do any real damage to him unless he attempts to self medicate.\n\nAs a minor, he's not in a position to self-advocate with doctors and it can take a period of **YEARS** for doctors to get around to confirming a neurodivergent diagnosis that's obvious to the individual. On top of that, some general practice doctors are advised against diagnosing people with certain conditions and instead refer people to specialist clinics with long wait times.\n\nYour brother might be wrong about his diagnosis (he might even have a *different* neurodivergency) but demanding that he have slip of paper to confirm his diagnosis to you just means that he's not going to seek out help and advice from you in future, it's not going to help him.", "YTA for not being supportive of your brother. He opened up to you and said he thought he had issues. Instead of talking with him about them or encouraging him to get professional help to understand them and control them, you told him he couldn't be right.\n\nThis was a lost opportunity. Go back and apologize. Ask him if he's looked for help and if not, tell him you'll help him find it.", "ESH. I fully agree with you that someone claiming they have a mental health issue without having ever been diagnosed or even seeing a doctor about it is a terrible trend that seems to be getting more popular lately... *However* this is one of those scenarios where you have to ask yourself \"would I rather be technically correct, or would I rather support my family\", because it is impossible to do both in this situation. \n\nYour brother clearly is having a tough time with something and has grasped onto a self diagnosis of being \"neurodivergent\" as a way to try and understand what he's going through. Just telling him he's wrong is dismissing his very serious concerns completely, and is basically telling him that he's an idiot, which can't be good for the self esteem of a frightened teenager who's already dealing with some issues... Just try to be supportive and keep encouraging him to maybe see a therapist if whatever is bothering him is really making it difficult for him to just live day to day.\n\nEdit: judging by the downvotes I've apparently offended someone. It seems the Reddit hive mind believes that any medical condition anyone has ever claimed to have or not have has and will always be valid regardless of anything any doctor may or may not have said or not said. It seems doctors are now considered completely unnecessary when diagnosing serious mental health concerns lol\n\nHave fun with that I guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NAH.  This is above reddit's paygrade / outside the scope of what can be easily discussed in a post.\n\nEither side could be true.  If he does not have actual access to proper medical care, how is he going to get diagnosed?\n\nOTOH, simply stating he has an issue and trying to use it as an excuse, isn't helping anything either.\n\nAssuming you care about your brother - the best thing to do here is to figure out how to get him to see a doctor, to figure out one way or the other.  That way, if he does have issues, he can get help.  And if he doesn't - he can start to move past and address the actual causes of his problems.", "Yta. Firstly, you're a hypocrite. You say he can't tell you he's nd then say it's probably social anxiety. You are also not a professional. Secondly, he knows himself better than you. And thirdly, diagnosis of any nd can be incredibly difficult to get. Your brother has discovered something about himself he wanted to share with you. Not sure he'll make that mistake again.", "I'm going with a soft YTA because you acknowledge that good care is hard to get in your country. It makes sense that he is searching for answers after feeling for a long time that he's different. You're also not a doctor but seem quick to assume he just has social anxiety instead of something else. Sounds like he's just looking for solutions and coping mechanisms, not spouting off on social media for attention.", "YTA\n\nEven if he \u201conly has social anxiety\u201d he\u2019s still neurodivergent.

An autism diagnosis can prevent certain non-necessary medical treatments because you can be viewed as medically unwell enough to make that decision. Autistic people are disqualified from military service (I mean, I have no interest in the military but others do). Custody claims can be damaged by your autism diagnosis. You can be denied organ transplants. Also people treat autistic folks like literal children. \n\nThe benefits of getting a diagnosis(for me)?

As you admit you yourself don\u2019t know where to start to get a diagnosis and that your country has a low knowledge of mental health conditions so maybe coming from a place of understanding would be more helpful here instead of shutting down his feelings. Why don\u2019t you help him see a professional? Why don\u2019t you help get him the help he feels he needs? If he is actually ND then he will have even more of a struggle than you would finding help.

In some cases, it's because they were neglected in their youth, and many people feel embarrassed, scared, and anxious about being diagnose when they are adult. \n\nAnd if you look carefully, you'll find that it's not easy for him to open up to you and tell you about it. So, even if you tell him that with good intentions But telling that is like you don't believe in his judgment.

Here in Canada, a lot of people are diagnosed late in life or have to rely on deep reflection and self-diagnosis because of lack of resources.

Most people I know who are autistic including me (I have since then been officially diagnosed) have spent months and months researching it. \n\nA self diagnosis for neurodivergence does no harm. It's the reason the autism community are very vocal in support of self diagnoses.Undiagnosed neurodivergence actually tends to do. Spending the first 40 years of my life undiagnosed, believe me, had caused trauma because of how people treated my symptoms. If self diagnosis helps him, why are you judging?

Most of them turned out nurodivergent and the weird character were part of the coping mechanisms or delusions, others thought it was fun and were just buying into what I can only call an analogue arg. \n\n10 years later it was popularly called \"kinning\" and the community would *dominate* some apps and certain communities.\n\nNow it's being applied to DID, I think because it adds a layer of protection with the medical term. \"You can't make fun of me or tell me I'm wrong or need to grow up because its *medical*\". Some of them might turn out to have DID, but mostly likely as they get older they will probably realize have other nurodicergencies or mental illnesses that they were coping with or they just needed to be allowed to play imagination games and be creative past the age where it was assumed they were too old to do so.\n\nAll in all it's the same shit some of my friends did when we were 15, but the internet has allowed it to span beyond \"other wierd kids in my school\".", "Not entirly sure what you're saying , but my point still stands, the boy is a teen in the story", "Well that\u2019s not a fair comparison, If my friend said that they\u2019ve torn their ACL without seeking a medical professional then no I would not believe them", "i agree that those are good options for people who can access them. you're right, learning where to look is a huge obstacle for a lot of people. I do think it's important to try and seek help, but i also think the reasons that many neurodivergent people DON'T seek help are also valid (discrimination once having a diagnosis being a huge one).\n\n I also am very curious why you believe that people who self diagnose are convincing themselves that they're broken and unfixable? (unless i misunderstood you) because in my experience it's actually the quite opposite. i know many people who did the research (NOT just tiktok) and used the information they found to help themselves develop coping mechanisms, find community, access to healhcare(!!), and genuinely understand themselves to the point what they realize they're NOT broken and that there's people like them who understand their pain and isolation in a world built for neurotypical people.", "No, I said people will self diagnose so they can feel better or feel like they are special when in fact they are ordinary.

We lived overseas and psychiatric care for us was hit or miss. We had good doctors and pretty awful ones. We had no insurance and times of joblessness so it wasn\u2019t affordable before we had the stability to get even the first diagnosis.

Neurodivergent is not a diagnosis.  It's literally just saying your brain works differently.

No one in my biological family has ever once seen a mental health professional so there was no chance of that happening as a child. But I\u2019ve always known there\u2019s something different about how my brain works and that I needed to cover it to make it acceptable to others. It was exhausting but became my default setting.\n\nWhen my stepson was diagnosed with ADHD, I started to learn more about it and I never expected for it to rock my own self-view at such a core level. Reading about neurodivergence is the first time I\u2019ve ever read my own personal internal struggles that I never shared with anyone explained outside of my own head. Things I never thought anyone would understand are outlined in articles as indicators. They even shown up in screening tests. When I read about common traits of women late diagnosed with autism it was like someone was reading my innermost thoughts. \n\nSo now I feel strongly on a fundamental level that I\u2019m neurodivergent in some way. I don\u2019t know or claim a specific diagnosis, but there\u2019s just too much that fits to ignore it.

I feel vulnerable, both that people won\u2019t believe me and that they will. There\u2019s dread to both scenarios. I\u2019ve barely talked about it with anyone. I\u2019m in my 30s, so because of my age I also feel like \u2018damn how much easier could things have been if I had had these strategies earlier\u2019 I also recognize I could be wrong about it.\n\nI think we\u2019re in an awkward growing pain where the awareness and research about mental health and neurodivergence is more accessible and advancing faster than the diagnostics and administration of them can currently keep up.

I must have ADHD,\" when really they just don't clean their room because they don't like cleaning and are a normal level of forgetful.\n\nMeanwhile when adults self-diagnose, it's more like they identify a pattern of behaviour over years where they struggled and didn't understand why everything was so hard or that it wasn't normal and like that for everyone.\n\nI personally think that self-diagnosis can be harmful. If someone doesn't have a disorder is claiming they do, then they set up false expectations for people with the actual disorder. Mental health is poorly understood, and they perpetuate misunderstandings.\n\nI also think self-diagnosis can be helpful. Once you have realized you potentially have an issue you can better learn how to manage it, even without professional help.\n\nI personally think that if you self-diagnose you shouldn't say  \"I have \\[disorder\\],\" but rather, \"I suspect I have \\[disorder\\]\" if you even have to bring it up at all.", "That's not a medical term, so, really he just proclaimed himself to be different from others.", " then they are a different and special and in need of special attention- has become a big problem.", "I had to fight tooth and nail to get my diagnosis for ADHD.

It does depend on the situation I'm afraid, as there are so many specifics, but for a general answer I'd say: You don't know what your brother fully experience(d/s), especially due to neurodivergent folks commonly masking to fit in. He could have hidden many symptoms that only he'd know he has. He knows himself best, and if he's not pretending to be diagnosed/will not admit that there is a possibility it's something else (possibility is the key word here, there is a difference in \"I very much think I have this\" vs. \"I definitely have this\")/using it as an excuse to be an ass rather than an explanation as to why he may act a certain way **(explaining, not excusing)**, then it's not your place to say whether or not he can identify with a term that matches his experiences.\n\nalso I just had to point out that **neuro**divergency is neurological rather that psychological, doesn't really matter but I had to say it for the peace of mind lol.\n\nalso also I've seen a few commenters brining up how Self Diagnosing is an important step in the process of getting an official diagnosis, as someone who is studying to go into the mental health field, yes!

Your brother clearly struggles and wants to communicate that to you, in which case, I think shutting him down wasn't the move. I understand where you were coming from though. I think supporting him in seeking diagnosis is your best move here, and recognising what he knows he deals with, even without using a diagnostic label. Like trying to help your friend if they're feeling unwell, despite not knowing why. If he doesn't want your support in that direction then there isn't much you can do, but that's where I would start personally.", "I mean it really depends on how deep his reasoning is and how difficult and stigmatized access ro mental health is where you live. Also I am in a western country and in my experience therapists and psychiatrist are really not concerned about giving you an ironclad diagnosis especially more complex ones that are included in neurodivergence. They kind of just treat you and see how you respond, they might sometimes let some vague indication of a *possible* diagnosis slide but nothing more. It would be bizarre to go to a therapist where I am to simply get a diagnosis (rather than get help with the symptoms) and it would certainly not be a one or two appointment affair and you would have to specifically ask for a formal diagnosis.

It's just very different.\n\nHaving said all that, I don't imagine myself saying I am certain I have a diagnosis I was not given but I could imagine discussing with someone close to me that I think I might have x, especially if I had no access to mental health.\n\nIt might also just help him explain hiw he feels in certain situations and he might feel you are invalidating his *symptoms*.

He might also have real conditions. He might not. Those aren\u2019t exclusive", "NAH. You are right, but it seems like he\u2019s a kid figuring stuff out for himself.", "NTA you can\u2019t diagnose yourself.", "I am running into a similar issue with someone I know. They have self diagnosed themselves as neurodivergent; however they will not seek any remedies for it or go to get an official diagnosis. They claim they (and is potentially true) that neurodivergent individuals are discriminated against in various aspects of life. Even still, it is fairly concerning that a lot of their behaviors they chalk up to being neurodivergent without wanting to seek assistance", "YTA\n\nMedical diagnosis, especially for something such as neurodivergence, is a massive privilege. I'll tell you why it's almost impossible to access.\n\nThe two \"iconic\" ND disorders that people most often think of when thinking about neurodivergence are autism and ADD/ADHD. These are most commonly diagnosed in childhood, and most commonly diagnosed in cis boys. Girls and anyone else who are not cis boys have astronomically higher chances of being missed in the diagnosis process because most \"professionals\" only diagnose based off of symptoms and traits commonly found in young cis boys. It is more common for anyone who is not a cis boy to internalize their symptoms and traits, so they get missed during diagnosis. The diagnosis process also almost always involves the input of parents, so anyone with inattentive parents also has a high chance of being missed.\n\nSo now all these undiagnosed people are adults and, if they happen to find out they might be ND, have to navigate trying to get a diagnosis. The biggest roadblock here is cost. Do you have insurance? Do you have a primary care provider? Can you convince your primary care provider that you need an assessment? Is there anyone within reasonable travel distance that can accurately assess adults? If the answer to any of these is no, you're going to have to go private and pay out of pocket. I'm personally in this situation and am having to save up 2k for assessment. That's not pocket change for someone who can't work due to their other disabilities.\n\nThe second biggest roadblock is the \"professionals\" themselves. Let's say you get an assessment set up, who's to say it's with someone that can be relied on to accurately diagnose adults? ND adults tend to have learned to mask fairly well at this point in their life (aka forcing themselves to act NT) and have a high chance of missing diagnosis because of this. It's ingrained in myself to force myself to make eye contact even though it's uncomfortable for me, so what happens if I do that during my assessment and the assessor tells me I'm not ND because of it? Does the fact that it's forced not matter? Do all my other symptoms not matter? In these people's eyes, the answer is often no, it doesn't matter.", "NTA \n\nyou are the responsible adult here.

Self diagnosis can be an extremely dangerous thing to do and I have seen this at the extreme level from a once friend that ended up ODing from self diagnosing themselves along with obtaining medication that they were not prescribed.\n\nSelf diagnosis can impact people mentally, even somebody with no symptoms can end up gaining symptoms due to the simple belief that something is wrong. This can be extremely dangerous.\n\nInstead of self diagnosis, get assistance in seeing a medical professional who can determine these sorts of things and give the correct advice, over reading those who clearly have 'Internet degrees' in subjects they are clueless over in reality.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re right.

You don't feel alone anymore. You no longer wonder if it's just you. And yeah once it clicks your first thought is \"it was so obvious\".\nThose of us who are diagnosed don't mind if someone undiagnosed call themselves neurodivergent. What we do mind is when someone says \"well we're all a bit adhd/autistic/sad/depressed/anxious sometimes\" .

Telling him he can\u2019t use a certain term that he believes fits him isn\u2019t helping him at all, if you really care about his well being you could help him do research on the disorder or start to help him look for someone who can diagnose him. If he\u2019s not diagnosed with the disorder, no harm no foul. But if u dismiss his concerns and don\u2019t listen to him he will lost trust in you, he might miss out on community and resources that he can use to improve his life, and if he is actually diagnosed he will resent you for not believing him.

Firstly, it is a long, time consuming and sometimes expensive process.

Therefore, people use resources online to try and make sense of their neurodivergence which can lead to a formal diagnosis later.

She has known me her entire life. She has seen me struggle in school because of my ADD and learning disabilities. My nephew is on the spectrum as well and it often manifests itself in unproductive ways like panic attacks, anxiety, inability to move off of certain subjects, etc. I\u2019ve never felt soo dismissed and offended than when she insinuated she too was on the spectrum, purely because she\u2019s quirky. She\u2019s a trust fund baby with a doctorate in some arcane musical theory, has never had a real job, and lives within her own little elitist bubble. Therefore, yes, she chooses not to listen to full conversations and chooses to digress conversations to these very non-relevant topics because that\u2019s what\u2019s on her mind. Having gone through the public school system in America with ADD and learning disabilities is a challenge to say the least.

If your brother has no access to getting a diagnosis, then he has no option but to try and make sense of things using the information available. And if that's what he's doing, then it is supremely unhelpful of you to say that he can't claim to have those problems, because assuming he isn't exaggerating, a lack of formal diagnosis doesn't make his struggles magically disappear.\n\nWhy don't you try to help him investigate how he can get access to a specialist who can make an adult diagnosis for neurodivergent conditions?", "YTA, dude. Many people who are neurodivergent don't have parents that support it and, therefore, aren't diagnosed till later in life. I didn't even find out it was a possibility until I heard about others' personal experiences. Ostracization from peers is a big giveaway. It sounds like you're coming from a place of someone who doesn't know much about neurodivergence, and it seems rather innocent. Try to educate yourself on people's personal experiences, some other  traits of neurodivergence, even the little things. Compare them to how you saw your brother growing up, try to talk to him, hear him out. I don't think you're coming from a place of maliciousness or purposeful ignorance, but you should give him the chance. Many people can't afford doctor diagnoses and stick to self-diagnosis. It probably wouldn't be harmful if he kept this to himself. From the way you mentioned it, it seems like he trusted you with this information, so you should respect that. If you're going to shut him down, make it for a good reason, if you find multiple discrepancies through research of your own. Or help him find resources and he can compare for himself. Educating yourself on this topic and hearing people out with these is VERY important, it might even help improve your relationship.", "YTA.

He knows himself better than you do, and just because he doesn't have a formal diagnosis of something, which you admit might be difficult to get in your country, that doesn't mean he isn't neurodivergent or doesn't have some condition that makes it difficult for him to navigate through life.\n\nI didn't know I had body dysmorphia until I saw someone on TV describe the symptoms. I went to my doctor and told her that's what I had. She had no idea what it was, she had never heard of it. I had to educate her about it. I have never had a formal diagnosis of dysmorphia yet I've had it for decades. My depression also went undiagnosed for 6 years because no one picked up on it. I knew something wasn't right but didn't have a name for it. \n\nDoctors and medical experts don't know everything. With neurodivergence, some medical professionals will discount it, not recognise it, or mistake it for something else. Going undiagnosed is par for the course. That doesn't mean there isn't an issue. Some professionals won't be as up to date on things like social anxiety, and some dismiss it altogether.\n\nMy own depression was dismissed as \"lack of social skills\" by a psychiatrist.

It's not harming you, is it, to accept what he's saying about himself. He may well be neurodivergent and never get a formal diagnosis, or have to wait years for one.

Thanks to Covid (bizarrely) when she returned to school after lockdown her ability to mask had been inhibited and they FINALLY agreed to refer her. The initial assessor told me that within minutes of meeting her he had already noted numerous traits and recommended full assessment. She is now 13 and still waiting with occasional letters reassuring us she is still on the waiting list and the school nurse hasn't been able to find out where on the list she actually is. So for now she is \"self-disgnosed\". Had the professionals stepped up when I first raised it, by now - one would hope - she would be diagnosed, however the fact she hasn't been assessed formally yet changes nothing about the level of support she needs.

Can I get assessed without having to pay to go private? Absolutely not.
