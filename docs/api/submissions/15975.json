And it\u2019s a combination of negative and positive symptoms. Like you can be afraid of dogs and cross the street and you can be so afraid of dogs you have a panic response, start sweating, trying not to cry, step into the street to wait for the dog to pass. One person is managing their fear intentionally, and the other person cannot mount a response, the being frozen and inability to respond, is also a symptom.\n\nSelf diagnosing is important to identify when to seek help and get a professional opinion. It\u2019s good he\u2019s thinking about it and if he\u2019s struggling in aspects of his life where he feels frozen or like he\u2019s struggling he should absolutely get help. But it\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019ll be able to accurately diagnose himself at 17/18 using the internet.", "Nah \n\n\nMate I can barely even make an appointment that is held at my own house let alone go to some office where the air smells and runs late all the time when I could be doing all these other exciting things, even though I just end up here, scrolling reddit", "Many of us neurodivergent people have a hard time getting diagnosed. Especially as adults. In fact, it can be almost impossible for an adult to get a diagnosis, even in the West. I'm ADHD, and I only figured it out when my kid (who seemed perfectly normal to me) was given a diagnosis based on behaviors he and I share. \n\nChances are good that your brother is right. \n\nAnd it's not a serious \"psychological condition\" like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. It's really the equivalent of being left-handed in a right-handed world. Once they get simple accommodations, many neurodivergent people thrive.  \n\nBut if folks are (proverbially) tying your left hand behind your back and slapping you with a ruler when you try to do things in the way that comes naturally, you are going to develop anxiety. \n\nYour brother is saying that he needs the social equivalent of left-handed scissors, and he needs people to accept his slightly unusual way of relating to others. If you do that, he will be happier and more able to be close to you. \n\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nFrom my point of view: I also tought I had conditions before I realized that was not the case. Sometimes symptoms can align with you, but that doesn't mean you have something.\n\nFor example, you can have a sore throat, but it can be a simple flu, or your may need to check with your dentist. Or your throat is acting up if you scratch it while swallowing, for example, popcorn, breadsticks, etc.\n\nNot to invalidate your brother, ofc. But he better check with a professional for these conditions. If he is correct, he can get help and become better. If he is wrong, he will focus on what is causing him to be this way, and if he doesn't like his behaviors, he can change it.", "NTA. It's understandable that your brother may be struggling with social anxiety or other issues, but it's not appropriate for him to self-diagnose as neurodivergent without consulting a medical professional. Doing so could potentially undermine the experiences of those who have been diagnosed with the condition by a professional. It's important to encourage your brother to seek out a proper diagnosis if he is concerned about his mental health, and to not rely on self-diagnosis. However, it's also important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and to avoid dismissing his experiences entirely.", "I\u2019m going to go NAH. Take different mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. There are pretty good tests that anyone can do - PHQ-9, GAD7 - to test for this. They\u2019re not infallible but they are clinical tests you can undertake without ever speaking to a medical professional. So with the right bit of reading, your brother might genuinely be on to something and believe based on his experience and what he\u2019s read, that he is neurodivergent. His view is unlikely to have any legal standing but beyond his conversation with you, you\u2019ve not indicated any attempt to use the diagnosis to personal benefit. And in your case, you\u2019ve a healthy dose of scepticism, nothing wrong with that, but perhaps err a little more on the side of acceptance unless/until brother starts trying to use their self-diagnosis as a reason to excuse poor behaviour.", "NAH: OP, Your brother has found a frame of reference to describe some of his experience. If it helps him find ways to cope with feelings he is uncomfortable with, that could be useful. You are correct; he may or may not fit the criteria for a specific \"diagnosis\".  Some people may judge your brother negatively if he shares his \"diagnosis\" with friends, others may not. It is your brother's life!", "NTA.  Your brother claiming to suffer from conditions he's never been diagnosed with is wrong.  He's kind of belittling the experiences of folks who actually suffering from these conditions by claiming them as his own just because he feels like it.  \n\nIf he is concerned about it, he should go to a doctor and get diagnosed.  If he does indeed have the conditions, he could then get treated.\n\nIt's obviously not the same thing, but what your brother is doing is the medical equivalent of someone claiming false honor/stolen valor.  And he's probably doing it for the same reasons too: to try to get benefits, sympathy, and/or pity.", "NTA.   \nIt's wrong for your brother to present himself with medical conditions he's never been diagnosed with. If this was a physical condition, then there would be no debate. For example, I have a mole on my shoulder someone once told me I should get looked at. I haven't gotten around to it yet. Should I go around telling everyone I'm a cancer patient? Of course not. This is basically what your brother is doing. He has a suspicion that he has a condition but has never seen a doctor for it. He's an AH for telling people he suffers from a condition that he doesn't. It belittles the experience for people who really are diagnosed with those issues.", "NTA. Your brother is wrong, but if it's not affecting you in any way then you should leave it alone.", "Yes YTA. Self identification or diagnosis is accepted in a lot of communities and, I am guessing, the one your brother is a part of. I don't see how this could cause a problem. Doctors generally ask about history of DX and make their own judgements based on their experience of the patient alongside medical history. Therapists do the same with clients. Presumably, he knows he can't force the issue with accomodations under the law without a diagnosis but he doesn't seem interested in that. \n\nWe could talk all day about how wrong it is that books designed to generate billing codes has taken over our understanding of human interaction and internal states, but they have and people have had to form communities and come to an understanding of themselves in that context. Trust me, if he's wrong his community will almost certainly figure it out and point him in the right direction. If he's manipulating or malingering they will destroy him from the inside out in a way that may shock you.\n\nEdited: I forget that so many people forget or don't know that an official diagnosis can affect one's rights under the law. For example, do you know how many countries flat out won't take disabled immigrants? Autistic people, even like engineers and otherwise desirable professionals aren't welcome in many countries. Did you see the other day a right wing media person on Twitter asking if folks thought \"mentally ill\" people should be able to vote? The majority of respondents said no. An old diagnosis can come up in a divorce or lawsuit and it will affect the outcome. There are reasons to avoid a paper trail.", "Slight YTA. You\u2019re not wrong about people potentially misdiagnosing themselves, but the solution to your brother telling you he thinks he has mental health issues is indeed to encourage him to get diagnosed, instead of telling him he may simply be misdiagnosing himself. The latter is equivalent to dismissing what he views as a helpful way to understand the problems he has been facing.", "YTA - self diagnosis is important esp for ND people to be able to acknowledge their experiences and if they need medication or supports it\u2019s the first step in those things. Do you not think that people acknowledge something feeling off before they go to a professional? Him being in his teens and realizing how much of his life has been hard and he feels different and people don\u2019t understand him to then have someone so close to him basically tell him it\u2019s all invalid would be super hurtful. He was confiding in you which is extra important considering you said mental illness is less focused on where you are from. \n\nDoctors validations are not the be all and end all for personal experience being valid and worth listening to.", "YTA\n\nIf someone self diagnoses with some form of neurodivergency, do you know what they generally do? They research coping mechanisms and try and apply them to their lives. Coping mechanisms are not dangerous, and they can provide huge benefits to people who are neurodivergent (hell, they can even benefit people who are neurotypical). A self diagnosis cannot do any real damage to him unless he attempts to self medicate.\n\nAs a minor, he's not in a position to self-advocate with doctors and it can take a period of **YEARS** for doctors to get around to confirming a neurodivergent diagnosis that's obvious to the individual. On top of that, some general practice doctors are advised against diagnosing people with certain conditions and instead refer people to specialist clinics with long wait times.\n\nYour brother might be wrong about his diagnosis (he might even have a *different* neurodivergency) but demanding that he have slip of paper to confirm his diagnosis to you just means that he's not going to seek out help and advice from you in future, it's not going to help him.", "YTA for not being supportive of your brother. He opened up to you and said he thought he had issues. Instead of talking with him about them or encouraging him to get professional help to understand them and control them, you told him he couldn't be right.\n\nThis was a lost opportunity. Go back and apologize. Ask him if he's looked for help and if not, tell him you'll help him find it.", "ESH. I fully agree with you that someone claiming they have a mental health issue without having ever been diagnosed or even seeing a doctor about it is a terrible trend that seems to be getting more popular lately... *However* this is one of those scenarios where you have to ask yourself \"would I rather be technically correct, or would I rather support my family\", because it is impossible to do both in this situation. \n\nYour brother clearly is having a tough time with something and has grasped onto a self diagnosis of being \"neurodivergent\" as a way to try and understand what he's going through. Just telling him he's wrong is dismissing his very serious concerns completely, and is basically telling him that he's an idiot, which can't be good for the self esteem of a frightened teenager who's already dealing with some issues... Just try to be supportive and keep encouraging him to maybe see a therapist if whatever is bothering him is really making it difficult for him to just live day to day.", "NAH.  This is above reddit's paygrade / outside the scope of what can be easily discussed in a post.\n\nEither side could be true.  If he does not have actual access to proper medical care, how is he going to get diagnosed?\n\nOTOH, simply stating he has an issue and trying to use it as an excuse, isn't helping anything either.\n\nAssuming you care about your brother - the best thing to do here is to figure out how to get him to see a doctor, to figure out one way or the other.  That way, if he does have issues, he can get help.  And if he doesn't - he can start to move past and address the actual causes of his problems.", "Yta. Firstly, you're a hypocrite. You say he can't tell you he's nd then say it's probably social anxiety. You are also not a professional. Secondly, he knows himself better than you. And thirdly, diagnosis of any nd can be incredibly difficult to get. Your brother has discovered something about himself he wanted to share with you. Not sure he'll make that mistake again.", "I'm going with a soft YTA because you acknowledge that good care is hard to get in your country. It makes sense that he is searching for answers after feeling for a long time that he's different. You're also not a doctor but seem quick to assume he just has social anxiety instead of something else. Sounds like he's just looking for solutions and coping mechanisms, not spouting off on social media for attention.", "YTA\n\nEven if he \u201conly has social anxiety\u201d he\u2019s still neurodivergent. Being ND isn\u2019t a medical diagnosis, it\u2019s an acceptance of the fact that we have a brain that somehow works differently to how neurotypical brains do. Anything that isn\u2019t neurologically typical is neurologically divergent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No. Self diagnoses is not an acceptable thing. I spent three months getting diagnosed for my anxieties, depressions ADD and eating disorders.

Why? \n\nYou can get conservatorship over someone if they\u2019re diagnosed autistic. Certain countries don\u2019t allow visas to autistic folks. The assessment is expensive. An autism diagnosis can prevent certain non-necessary medical treatments because you can be viewed as medically unwell enough to make that decision. Autistic people are disqualified from military service (I mean, I have no interest in the military but others do). Custody claims can be damaged by your autism diagnosis. You can be denied organ transplants. Also people treat autistic folks like literal children. \n\nThe benefits of getting a diagnosis? Literally nothing except smucks like OP will stfu. \n\nIf I know that I don\u2019t inherently understand human interactions, can\u2019t make small talk, have hyper fixations, can\u2019t make eye contact, have to pretend to act like everyone else in public, don\u2019t pick up on nuance, feel sick at certain sounds, can\u2019t audial process multiple things at the same time, and am uncomfortable with new people - I mean I may not have the autistic card but what\u2019s the difference if I have many of the signs? Especially as a woman, since autistic diagnosis for women is notoriously bad.\n\nObviously diagnosis can be useful (especially if you have something that can be managed with medications or you\u2019re low functioning) but if you\u2019ve made it to adulthood as just a kind of odd person that\u2019s done fine in life and can hold down a job and manage school by yourself, the diagnosis hurts more than helps imo.

I assure you it does not. There are no 15% autism and PTSD discounts at sandwich shops and museums. \n\nA diagnosis will affect one's likelihood of maintaining custody of their children and lower the dollar amount of almost any settlement or judgement should they sue someone.
