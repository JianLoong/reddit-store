I countered that opinions from non-medical professionals don't really count for much, and that he could just have social anxiety he does not know how to manage, and that it sounds more like he wants to claim an explanation for himself that I feel should really be left to professionals.\n\nHis argument was that I was discounting his experiences, and that it \"was obvious\" that he is neurodivergent. My thoughts on the matter is that it is very reckless of him to claim a real condition for himself that he may or may not have without confirmation from a medical professional, because I feel that the possibility of someone claiming to be something they are not can have real, if overall tiny, effects on the perception of the people who really do have the condition if they take his word about being neurodivergent at face value.

And it\u2019s a combination of negative and positive symptoms. Like you can be afraid of dogs and cross the street and you can be so afraid of dogs you have a panic response, start sweating, trying not to cry, step into the street to wait for the dog to pass. One person is managing their fear intentionally, and the other person cannot mount a response, the being frozen and inability to respond, is also a symptom.\n\nSelf diagnosing is important to identify when to seek help and get a professional opinion. It\u2019s good he\u2019s thinking about it and if he\u2019s struggling in aspects of his life where he feels frozen or like he\u2019s struggling he should absolutely get help.

Especially as adults. In fact, it can be almost impossible for an adult to get a diagnosis, even in the West. I'm ADHD, and I only figured it out when my kid (who seemed perfectly normal to me) was given a diagnosis based on behaviors he and I share. \n\nChances are good that your brother is right. \n\nAnd it's not a serious \"psychological condition\" like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. It's really the equivalent of being left-handed in a right-handed world. Once they get simple accommodations, many neurodivergent people thrive.  \n\nBut if folks are (proverbially) tying your left hand behind your back and slapping you with a ruler when you try to do things in the way that comes naturally, you are going to develop anxiety. \n\nYour brother is saying that he needs the social equivalent of left-handed scissors, and he needs people to accept his slightly unusual way of relating to others. If you do that, he will be happier and more able to be close to you. \n\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nFrom my point of view: I also tought I had conditions before I realized that was not the case. Sometimes symptoms can align with you, but that doesn't mean you have something.\n\nFor example, you can have a sore throat, but it can be a simple flu, or your may need to check with your dentist. Or your throat is acting up if you scratch it while swallowing, for example, popcorn, breadsticks, etc.\n\nNot to invalidate your brother, ofc. But he better check with a professional for these conditions. If he is correct, he can get help and become better. If he is wrong, he will focus on what is causing him to be this way, and if he doesn't like his behaviors, he can change it.", "NTA. It's understandable that your brother may be struggling with social anxiety or other issues, but it's not appropriate for him to self-diagnose as neurodivergent without consulting a medical professional. Doing so could potentially undermine the experiences of those who have been diagnosed with the condition by a professional. It's important to encourage your brother to seek out a proper diagnosis if he is concerned about his mental health, and to not rely on self-diagnosis. However, it's also important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and to avoid dismissing his experiences entirely.", "I\u2019m going to go NAH. Take different mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. There are pretty good tests that anyone can do - PHQ-9, GAD7 - to test for this. They\u2019re not infallible but they are clinical tests you can undertake without ever speaking to a medical professional. So with the right bit of reading, your brother might genuinely be on to something and believe based on his experience and what he\u2019s read, that he is neurodivergent. His view is unlikely to have any legal standing but beyond his conversation with you, you\u2019ve not indicated any attempt to use the diagnosis to personal benefit. And in your case, you\u2019ve a healthy dose of scepticism, nothing wrong with that, but perhaps err a little more on the side of acceptance unless/until brother starts trying to use their self-diagnosis as a reason to excuse poor behaviour.", "NAH: OP, Your brother has found a frame of reference to describe some of his experience. If it helps him find ways to cope with feelings he is uncomfortable with, that could be useful. You are correct; he may or may not fit the criteria for a specific \"diagnosis\".  Some people may judge your brother negatively if he shares his \"diagnosis\" with friends, others may not. It is your brother's life!", "NTA.  Your brother claiming to suffer from conditions he's never been diagnosed with is wrong.  He's kind of belittling the experiences of folks who actually suffering from these conditions by claiming them as his own just because he feels like it.  \n\nIf he is concerned about it, he should go to a doctor and get diagnosed.  If he does indeed have the conditions, he could then get treated.\n\nIt's obviously not the same thing, but what your brother is doing is the medical equivalent of someone claiming false honor/stolen valor.  And he's probably doing it for the same reasons too: to try to get benefits, sympathy, and/or pity.", "NTA.   \nIt's wrong for your brother to present himself with medical conditions he's never been diagnosed with. If this was a physical condition, then there would be no debate. For example, I have a mole on my shoulder someone once told me I should get looked at. I haven't gotten around to it yet. Should I go around telling everyone I'm a cancer patient? Of course not. This is basically what your brother is doing. He has a suspicion that he has a condition but has never seen a doctor for it. He's an AH for telling people he suffers from a condition that he doesn't. It belittles the experience for people who really are diagnosed with those issues.", "NTA. Your brother is wrong, but if it's not affecting you in any way then you should leave it alone.", "Yes YTA. Self identification or diagnosis is accepted in a lot of communities and, I am guessing, the one your brother is a part of. I don't see how this could cause a problem. Doctors generally ask about history of DX and make their own judgements based on their experience of the patient alongside medical history. Therapists do the same with clients. Presumably, he knows he can't force the issue with accomodations under the law without a diagnosis but he doesn't seem interested in that. \n\nWe could talk all day about how wrong it is that books designed to generate billing codes has taken over our understanding of human interaction and internal states, but they have and people have had to form communities and come to an understanding of themselves in that context. Trust me, if he's wrong his community will almost certainly figure it out and point him in the right direction. If he's manipulating or malingering they will destroy him from the inside out in a way that may shock you.\n\nEdited: I forget that so many people forget or don't know that an official diagnosis can affect one's rights under the law. For example, do you know how many countries flat out won't take disabled immigrants? Autistic people, even like engineers and otherwise desirable professionals aren't welcome in many countries. Did you see the other day a right wing media person on Twitter asking if folks thought \"mentally ill\" people should be able to vote? The majority of respondents said no. An old diagnosis can come up in a divorce or lawsuit and it will affect the outcome. There are reasons to avoid a paper trail.", "Slight YTA. You\u2019re not wrong about people potentially misdiagnosing themselves, but the solution to your brother telling you he thinks he has mental health issues is indeed to encourage him to get diagnosed, instead of telling him he may simply be misdiagnosing himself. The latter is equivalent to dismissing what he views as a helpful way to understand the problems he has been facing.", "YTA - self diagnosis is important esp for ND people to be able to acknowledge their experiences and if they need medication or supports it\u2019s the first step in those things. Do you not think that people acknowledge something feeling off before they go to a professional? Him being in his teens and realizing how much of his life has been hard and he feels different and people don\u2019t understand him to then have someone so close to him basically tell him it\u2019s all invalid would be super hurtful. He was confiding in you which is extra important considering you said mental illness is less focused on where you are from. \n\nDoctors validations are not the be all and end all for personal experience being valid and worth listening to.", "YTA\n\nIf someone self diagnoses with some form of neurodivergency, do you know what they generally do? They research coping mechanisms and try and apply them to their lives. Coping mechanisms are not dangerous, and they can provide huge benefits to people who are neurodivergent (hell, they can even benefit people who are neurotypical). A self diagnosis cannot do any real damage to him unless he attempts to self medicate.\n\nAs a minor, he's not in a position to self-advocate with doctors and it can take a period of **YEARS** for doctors to get around to confirming a neurodivergent diagnosis that's obvious to the individual. On top of that, some general practice doctors are advised against diagnosing people with certain conditions and instead refer people to specialist clinics with long wait times.\n\nYour brother might be wrong about his diagnosis (he might even have a *different* neurodivergency) but demanding that he have slip of paper to confirm his diagnosis to you just means that he's not going to seek out help and advice from you in future, it's not going to help him.", "YTA for not being supportive of your brother. He opened up to you and said he thought he had issues. Instead of talking with him about them or encouraging him to get professional help to understand them and control them, you told him he couldn't be right.\n\nThis was a lost opportunity. Go back and apologize. Ask him if he's looked for help and if not, tell him you'll help him find it.", "ESH. I fully agree with you that someone claiming they have a mental health issue without having ever been diagnosed or even seeing a doctor about it is a terrible trend that seems to be getting more popular lately... *However* this is one of those scenarios where you have to ask yourself \"would I rather be technically correct, or would I rather support my family\", because it is impossible to do both in this situation. \n\nYour brother clearly is having a tough time with something and has grasped onto a self diagnosis of being \"neurodivergent\" as a way to try and understand what he's going through. Just telling him he's wrong is dismissing his very serious concerns completely, and is basically telling him that he's an idiot, which can't be good for the self esteem of a frightened teenager who's already dealing with some issues... Just try to be supportive and keep encouraging him to maybe see a therapist if whatever is bothering him is really making it difficult for him to just live day to day.\n\nEdit: judging by the downvotes I've apparently offended someone. It seems the Reddit hive mind believes that any medical condition anyone has ever claimed to have or not have has and will always be valid regardless of anything any doctor may or may not have said or not said. It seems doctors are now considered completely unnecessary when diagnosing serious mental health concerns lol\n\nHave fun with that I guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NAH.  This is above reddit's paygrade / outside the scope of what can be easily discussed in a post.\n\nEither side could be true.  If he does not have actual access to proper medical care, how is he going to get diagnosed?\n\nOTOH, simply stating he has an issue and trying to use it as an excuse, isn't helping anything either.\n\nAssuming you care about your brother - the best thing to do here is to figure out how to get him to see a doctor, to figure out one way or the other.  That way, if he does have issues, he can get help.  And if he doesn't - he can start to move past and address the actual causes of his problems.", "Yta. Firstly, you're a hypocrite. You say he can't tell you he's nd then say it's probably social anxiety. You are also not a professional. Secondly, he knows himself better than you. And thirdly, diagnosis of any nd can be incredibly difficult to get. Your brother has discovered something about himself he wanted to share with you. Not sure he'll make that mistake again.", "I'm going with a soft YTA because you acknowledge that good care is hard to get in your country. It makes sense that he is searching for answers after feeling for a long time that he's different. You're also not a doctor but seem quick to assume he just has social anxiety instead of something else. Sounds like he's just looking for solutions and coping mechanisms, not spouting off on social media for attention.", "YTA\n\nEven if he \u201conly has social anxiety\u201d he\u2019s still neurodivergent.

An autism diagnosis can prevent certain non-necessary medical treatments because you can be viewed as medically unwell enough to make that decision. Autistic people are disqualified from military service (I mean, I have no interest in the military but others do). Custody claims can be damaged by your autism diagnosis. You can be denied organ transplants. Also people treat autistic folks like literal children. \n\nThe benefits of getting a diagnosis(for me)?

Some of them might turn out to have DID, but mostly likely as they get older they will probably realize have other nurodicergencies or mental illnesses that they were coping with or they just needed to be allowed to play imagination games and be creative past the age where it was assumed they were too old to do so.\n\nAll in all it's the same shit some of my friends did when we were 15, but the internet has allowed it to span beyond \"other wierd kids in my school\".", "Not entirly sure what you're saying , but my point still stands, the boy is a teen in the story", "Well that\u2019s not a fair comparison, If my friend said that they\u2019ve torn their ACL without seeking a medical professional then no I would not believe them", "i agree that those are good options for people who can access them. you're right, learning where to look is a huge obstacle for a lot of people. I do think it's important to try and seek help, but i also think the reasons that many neurodivergent people DON'T seek help are also valid (discrimination once having a diagnosis being a huge one).\n\n I also am very curious why you believe that people who self diagnose are convincing themselves that they're broken and unfixable? (unless i misunderstood you) because in my experience it's actually the quite opposite. i know many people who did the research (NOT just tiktok) and used the information they found to help themselves develop coping mechanisms, find community, access to healhcare(!!), and genuinely understand themselves to the point what they realize they're NOT broken and that there's people like them who understand their pain and isolation in a world built for neurotypical people.", "No, I said people will self diagnose so they can feel better or feel like they are special when in fact they are ordinary.

I was never sure of the diagnosis, but it helped her feel seen, so I didn\u2019t worry about it. She also deals with depression and crippling anxiety. We lived overseas and psychiatric care for us was hit or miss. We had good doctors and pretty awful ones. We had no insurance and times of joblessness so it wasn\u2019t affordable before we had the stability to get even the first diagnosis. That was after six years of care by psychiatrists and psychologists. Last summer, we moved to the US and saw a psychologist here. At the end of her first 45 minute session, she asked, \u201cdo you think you might be autistic?\u201d I smiled while listening because we \u201cself-diagnosed\u201d her 2 years earlier. She didn\u2019t document the diagnosis and we didn\u2019t seek treatment for it. We didn\u2019t really see the point. She knows and can access resources and her therapist will help her with coping strategies. If OP we\u2019re in the US, I\u2019d give him a maybe. But he\u2019s not. He wants to say go get a diagnosis, but I can\u2019t even sugar anywhere for you to go. YTA. A total AH. And for me, given the situation described, yes I\u2019m totally fine with the brother calling himself neurodivergent. If he thinks differently then he is\u2026 are there accommodations he\u2019ll be inaccurately asking for, if care is that rare then no. The school will not be accommodating this kid. So his life is hard enough. Allow him to feel seen and heard.", "i'm gonna jump on this thread really quick just to say i just got diagnosed with ADHD in november. i'm 21. been calling myself ND since i was 15. i genuinely don't think the kid is wrong for calling himself ND if he truly identifies with the symptoms/aspects of certain things. might be a case like me where he does get diagnosed later down the line and had a feeling the whole time.", "Why not?  Neurodivergent is not a diagnosis.  It's literally just saying your brain works differently.  I think the average person is perfectly capable of deciding for themselves whether or not their brain is a little fucky.\n\nThe question is whether they're using it for pity or progress.  There's miles of difference between \"I have some traits of ADHD, and they're limiting me.  I should use this information to work around those limitations.\" And \"I have self-diagnosed ADHD, you need to accommodate me.\"", "Nope. I sure don\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019ve been diagnosed neurodivergent in a couple different ways stemming back to young childhood (which as a girl in the 90\u2019s\u2026it was *obvious* for them to do that), my sibling in just the last year or so (right after getting TikTok) is suddenly saying *they* are also neurodivergent and when I was like ok then, go see a doctor about it they refuse.\n\nDon\u2019t claim a diagnosis when you won\u2019t get off your ass and find a doctor, especially when someone offers a referral *to* the doctor.", "I struggle with this question. \n\nIn my case I am not diagnosed anything. No one in my biological family has ever once seen a mental health professional so there was no chance of that happening as a child. But I\u2019ve always known there\u2019s something different about how my brain works and that I needed to cover it to make it acceptable to others. It was exhausting but became my default setting.\n\nWhen my stepson was diagnosed with ADHD, I started to learn more about it and I never expected for it to rock my own self-view at such a core level. Reading about neurodivergence is the first time I\u2019ve ever read my own personal internal struggles that I never shared with anyone explained outside of my own head. Things I never thought anyone would understand are outlined in articles as indicators. They even shown up in screening tests. When I read about common traits of women late diagnosed with autism it was like someone was reading my innermost thoughts. \n\nSo now I feel strongly on a fundamental level that I\u2019m neurodivergent in some way. I don\u2019t know or claim a specific diagnosis, but there\u2019s just too much that fits to ignore it. And saying \u201cneurodivergent\u201d as opposed to a specific name feels safer while I\u2019m still in this diagnosis limbo. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like a special snowflake self-diagnosing as neurodivergent. I feel vulnerable, both that people won\u2019t believe me and that they will. There\u2019s dread to both scenarios. I\u2019ve barely talked about it with anyone. I\u2019m in my 30s, so because of my age I also feel like \u2018damn how much easier could things have been if I had had these strategies earlier\u2019 I also recognize I could be wrong about it.\n\nI think we\u2019re in an awkward growing pain where the awareness and research about mental health and neurodivergence is more accessible and advancing faster than the diagnostics and administration of them can currently keep up. I hope it will settle in a few years, there will be more resources for adult screenings and a better ability to discern those who found ways to hide it but still need help.", "I think it's fine and am not concerned about the number of teenagers self diagnosing.", "Exactly. I understand WHY emigration relies on discrimination. Which is WHY it\u2019s better not have certain conditions on the record if you can avoid it.", "Are you actually bragging that your country relies on discrimination while also complaining you are discriminated against? This just got weird\u2026", "Alright, agree to disagree fair enough. My reasoning personally is if a kid has depression, but if alot of kids say they are depressed then people might dismiss them despite the fact they need help. This might be a non issue and I would be intrested to hear an experts view on it", "So lie and when you come to the country you can't work and live off social welfare and take up the resources. Sounds fair. If that wouldn't be the case then it's obviously high functioning autism that doesn't need any medical help or therapy and other resources provided by the country and they would not see your partners level of autism as a possible drain on limited resources", "No I'm saying every country relies on discrimination if you don't think so go look up how to emigrate anywhere and there will be a list of criteria. Age discrimination health discrimination mental health discrimination, emigration isn't a right you can't just go to any country and say hey I'm gonna live here now but shit I've got heart disease and I need an expensive operation you guys pay. My point about my blindness is I fully understand why another country would not see me as a good fit for their country as I need a whole host of things to keep me safe and healthy amd my work contributions would be small.
