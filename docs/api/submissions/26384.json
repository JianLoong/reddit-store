It's a 2BHK where one room is used as bedroom and other  for every other activity ranging from work out to office work. I like having the distinction. And I prefer living alone, I don't like anyone in my space. And definitely not kids\n\nMy sister (F35) and her two children (M4, M6) are being evicted due to not paying rent for last 4 months. She asked if she could move in with me since I have an additional room. I told her I am sorry for her but she cannot move into my space. I need the space. \n\nShe cannot move back with our parents cause she had kids out of wedlock and they disowned her for that. \n\nShe keeps calling me alternating between pleading and calling me AH. \n\nI told her I can't let her and kids move in cause this place is my only sane place for myself. I can't compromise on that. \n\nI also don't have extra money to give her to help. \n\nAITA?\n\nSomeone asked me to add this:\n\nI don't have a good relationship with my sister. From what I remember, she always hated me for being born and taking attention away from me. She started acting out at 13, partied through her 20s till she got pregnant with her first child. She was never a sister to me. After she turned 18, (when I was 11) she moved out and visited at most for Christmas dinners. She missed out on that too most of the times. \n\nShe came around and asked my parents for shelter and help when she got pregnant. They had enough of her disregard and antics and disowned her. Their words. I was 21 and in college then. \n\nShe never called me when baby daddy was in the picture. She called when he left and she needed me to babysit. That's two years ago and I had never seen them before. I said no, cause I have to work for hours she needed me to babysit and the resentment she only called if she needed help. She tried it for a while, and finally let up. Never called me again. Not for bdays or anything. Next set of calls I am getting is for this. Asking to move in. \n\nI don't have a relationship with my nephews and like I said, my relationship with my sister isn't great either. So no, I am not worried about NC.

She is not a safe option to have as a tenant.", "NTA\n\nHer situation sucks, but you aren't obliged to bail her out.  Did  she lose her job or something?  Her partner abandon her?  Why the sudden no payments for 4 months?", "NTA\n\nIt's your place, your rules.  For all the reason you stated in your first paragraph, you are not the AH.", "She's known for 4 months that she was having issues paying rent.  This cannot be a huge surprise to her.  Why didn't she even try to make other plans?  Enlist support earlier?  It will be way harder now with an eviction on her record.  \n\nMy initial inclination would be to let them stay briefly until they find a new space, however then reason would set in (hopefully before I opened my mouth) and I would realize that there would be no way this is short term and no way to get her to leave and that it would absolutely drive me stark raving mad within just a few days--and I like kids!  So no.  Just no.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nIts your safe place. If you let her stay you will never get rid of her", "NTA\nIf she has not paid rent for 4 months I am pretty sure if you let her in you will never get her out. Don\u2019t do it.", "First off, where is the father in all this? He has an obligation to take care of his kids. Not necessarily your sister but he should step up and prevent his kids from being homeless.\n\nSecondly, she's getting evicted for not paying rent. That shows that she will bring nothing financially into your home and you will have to support her and two children along with yourself. Furthermore, she doesn't care that she made herself homeless let alone her children; what on God's green earth makes you think she cares if she makes you homeless too?\n\nObviously NTA. But definitely call CPS for her children if she goes into an unsafe environment with them or chooses to live on the streets with them. It's not their fault that their mom made them homeless.", "NTA. \n\nShe isn\u2019t entitled to your apartment, where there is no space for her and her children. \n\nThis is not your problem.

You would never be able to get her to leave.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have space, you don't have funds to support her and her kids, your home isn't set up for kids, and, because you know know it will come up, you're not a babysitter.", "NTA. I had a small cottage with two bedrooms and one bathroom. Even it seemed too small to absorb another human being. It was just big enough, IMO for my dog and me. A really sweet intern in our office had a housing snafu and so I invited her to rent a room from me (Super cheap. She had enough problems.) And she remains my friend unto this day. But, I can't lie. We couldn't wait to stop sharing such a small space.\n\nSo, NTA. Cramping in close quarters isn't a solution lots of the time. It just makes matters worse. And, I would not take another call from my sister for at least a week until she learned to be gracious and stopped blaming you for her circumstances. Let her stew in her own venom and get over that part all by herself. You did not evict her. You did not cause a rift between her and your parents and you aren't her super hero to always be fixing her messy problems.", "She is being evicted... that means she dug her heals in and they had to force her out.  She could do that to you.  Not to mention what does your lease say?  There is no way in the us it would be legal to cram 3 people into one room.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't have the space.  You have the space for your own needs, you need that division, for your mental health.  **You know what you need,** and you have made it happen.  \n\nYou don't like the chaos of children or others in your space, that's why you have your space as you do, without roommates.  **You know her being there wouldn't be healthy for you.**\n\nWith a person that won't accept your decision about your home, I wouldn't be surprised if she was staying with you, to have her stomping boundaries daily, making the situation even worse for you.  \n\n**She's manipulative and insulting to you, when you won't comply** with her demands on you.\n\n**It's okay to stop answering, and to block her if she won't stop this.  You told her your decision about her demand**.  Her repeating it won't make a difference, but it is manipulative, trying to wear you down.\n\nYour reasons are valid, and her behavior shows that there are likely more reasons that you haven't mentioned here, based on how she's behaving.", "NTA.

Why\u2019s she so behind on rent? Don\u2019t want to invite that drama in to destroy your peace.", "NTA. She'll never leave and you'll become a babysitter.

She might have to find a shared apartment to rent; she might need to apply for public housing. She needs to get her own act together.\n\nYou do not have to turn your life upside down for them. It won't be temporary. Your sister needs to face reality and grow up.", "NTA the sperm donor is the biggest asshole, followed by your parents. I hope she\u2019s spent these past 4 months looking into social services that she might be able to access instead of just waiting to be evicted and hoping you\u2019d come to the rescue.

She should hit up her baby-daddy for money and/or housing if she needs help.", "NTA. You never own anyone an explanation of why they can't crash in your space. It's YOUR space, and what you say goes, end of story.  \n\n\nThere are any number of agencies that will look after your sister and her kids.

A two room apartment with 4 people living in it is just not sustainable.\n\nBut YTA for coming to the internet to gather sympathy points while your sister and your nephews suffer impending homelessness. You should be out there and help her in ways that you can. Look up resources. Get into contact with people that could help her. This is an incredible stressful time for her and her children. The dad has fled the country, she is a young single mom of two kids so she probably doesn't have a lot of friends she could rely on and your parents are religious fruitcakes and no help as well.\n\nSo please find some decency and help her get some help from someone who can help.

But I get most people on this sub are selfish and self centered as fuck. I'm gonna change my opinion a little because I must have passed over the part where you said she was toxic and hateful to you ( I probably would still let her live with me , just for the kids sake but I understand why you wouldn't want to).

But wow.", "INFO you may not be able to give her a place to live but there may be other ways to help her. Does she have a job? Can you help her look up resources to help her find affordable housing? Did she offer a time limit of staying with you?", "NTA.\n\nYou know your sister better than we do.

If anything, they should be the ones stepping up here.", "NTA\n\nPersonally I would probably welcome her in for a very short period of time as she seeks a new place.

However both you and OP are probably far nicer people than I am.", "And really it's her parents responsibility more than OPs. Disowning her because she got pregnant is not Parent of the Year behavior and they could at least help her get some place or a trailer etc. while she waits for social services if there are any.

But she's 35, and her kids are little, so she basically had a good decade or so where she should have been  cultivating job skills. \n\nIt is not \"selfish and self centered as fuck\" to not want to enable a person with a history of making really stupid life choices. I get that the kids need help, and for the kids' sake the sister should try to do something to help - but she shouldn't be a martyr about it, because if she does, the next step will be for her needy sib to demand and/or take even more.

And more.", "Where did you get that logic?", "Wjy did tou assume she is a deadbeat?\n\nIsnit because she can't afford her rent?", "That\u2019s sad, but all the more reason she needs to speak to someone that can help her, she may be entitled to extra benefits.

It's your space and you owe her nothing. \n\nI also don't see how that would be viable at all, to be honest. I had to Google what a 2BHK is... it sounds like you walk into a kitchen and then have a hall with 2 bedrooms off of it? I'm assuming there's a bathroom in there somewhere. \n\nBut even if the relationship between your sister wasn't strained, I honestly don't see how she expects her and 2 young boys to basically live their lives in a bedroom while all 4 of you fight over space.\n\nI also imagine she would definitely try to use you as a built in babysitter.", "NTA.

You're absolutely doing the right thing.", ">I (F28) live alone in my apartment. It's a 2BHK where one room is used as bedroom and other for every other activity ranging from work out to office work.

She asked if she could move in with me since I have an additional room. I told her I am sorry for her but she cannot move into my space. I need the space.\n\nLook, I won't say evictions don't happen due to tragedies or downturns in a persons life, but there's a reason some landlords want the equivalent of a resume, because some tenants are not reliable people at heart. Your sister defaulted on rent for four months, and only now wants to find other accommodations? She had to know that eviction was a possibility.\n\nPlus, the fact that based off your description the chances of her moving in and trying to dump babysitting responsibility on you would be pretty much 100% I can understand saying no. That she has never sought to forge any sort of bond with you just makes her look like a user really, only around when she wants something, but wouldn't piss in your ass if you were onfire any other time.\n\nNTA", "NTA stand firm on your position.

In A Ontario and likely other places: \n\n\"A tenant who shares a kitchen or bathroom with the owner or the owner\u2019s family does not have a legal right to remain living on the premises without the owner\u2019s consent, and can usually be evicted at any time without notice. The exception is if the tenant enters into an oral or written agreement with the owner and the owner breaks the agreement by forcing a tenant to move out early, or disposes of a tenant\u2019s property. In both instances, the tenant may be able to sue the owner in Small Claims Court if they have evidence to prove their case.\"", "The majority of the US has the rule that if someone is staying in your house for more than 30 days and had their mail being delivered to the residence they established residency. They become a tenant, obviously they didn\u2019t sign a lease but legally they now live there. Now owner/landlord has to go through the courts to evict them if they want that person gone. \n\nThe steps for eviction is 30 day notice to get out, if they don\u2019t leave, then they have to go to court to have a judge throw them out. If they don\u2019t leave when the judge tells them to then they have to have cops get involved. It\u2019s a long drawn out process in the states."]}
