For all the reason you stated in your first paragraph, you are not the AH.", "She's known for 4 months that she was having issues paying rent.  This cannot be a huge surprise to her.  Why didn't she even try to make other plans?  Enlist support earlier?  It will be way harder now with an eviction on her record.  \n\nMy initial inclination would be to let them stay briefly until they find a new space, however then reason would set in (hopefully before I opened my mouth) and I would realize that there would be no way this is short term and no way to get her to leave and that it would absolutely drive me stark raving mad within just a few days--and I like kids!  So no.  Just no.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nIts your safe place. If you let her stay you will never get rid of her", "NTA\nIf she has not paid rent for 4 months I am pretty sure if you let her in you will never get her out. Don\u2019t do it.", "First off, where is the father in all this? He has an obligation to take care of his kids. Not necessarily your sister but he should step up and prevent his kids from being homeless.\n\nSecondly, she's getting evicted for not paying rent. That shows that she will bring nothing financially into your home and you will have to support her and two children along with yourself. Furthermore, she doesn't care that she made herself homeless let alone her children; what on God's green earth makes you think she cares if she makes you homeless too?\n\nObviously NTA. But definitely call CPS for her children if she goes into an unsafe environment with them or chooses to live on the streets with them. It's not their fault that their mom made them homeless.", "NTA. \n\nShe isn\u2019t entitled to your apartment, where there is no space for her and her children. \n\nThis is not your problem.

We couldn't wait to stop sharing such a small space.\n\nSo, NTA. Cramping in close quarters isn't a solution lots of the time. It just makes matters worse. And, I would not take another call from my sister for at least a week until she learned to be gracious and stopped blaming you for her circumstances.

You did not cause a rift between her and your parents and you aren't her super hero to always be fixing her messy problems.", "She is being evicted... that means she dug her heals in and they had to force her out.

You told her your decision about her demand**.

Perhaps she\u2019s burned too many bridges and has abused previous offerings of support and help. Perhaps the OP knows there\u2019s a strong chance this *isn\u2019t* her hitting rock bottom, and things are likely going to get worse no matter what the OP can do, therefore it\u2019s better to have emotional and physical distance now.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of reasonable reasons for why this is a bad idea. At the same time, I know too many people who were in similar situations who were forever changed for the better because family and friends opened their doors even if it wasn\u2019t easy. People who worked hard and were trying to be responsible yet fell back on bills or were suddenly left with debt and/burdens they weren\u2019t expecting. People who are not familiar with that level of need often don\u2019t understand how quickly debt can snowball or how vital support actually is to avoiding these situations.\n\nI understand there is privilege in being in a position where you can open your doors to loved ones and others in need. I get that not everyone is in a position to do it and that not every person is someone that\u2019s safe to bring into your home.\n\nHowever, if there\u2019s not a history of abusing support, I can\u2019t imagine seeing people I love in their worst state and not helping because I enjoy my space.

I was in college and would have loved having the space in my condo to myself but he's family and you don't just let family suffer.
