{"id": 20508, "submission_id": "14i5d0y", "title": "AITA for making a policy that fish cannot be heated up at work?", "selftext": "I have a small business with about a dozen employees, renting out an office space. We often have clients coming to meet with us.\n\nEmployees have the choice on their breaks to either eat in the lounge, at their desk or leave the premises. There's a microwave and small fridge in the lounge. Originally, I only had 2 rules for the microwave: clean up after yourself if your food makes a mess and no popcorn, as it could set off the fire alarm. There have been no other issues until now.\n\nA few months ago, I hired \"Jane\". She's heated up fish a few times now, while leaving the door to the lounge open. It stunk up the entire office and I know others were not happy. I wasn't either, but I felt weird restricting lunch foods. I did put up a sign and send out an e-mail saying if you're going to heat anything up in the microwave, close the door to the lounge. It wouldn't save the lounge from the smell but would contain it to the area and since there are other places for the staff to eat, it was an easy compromise. Everyone was happy with this, including Jane.\nJane was pretty good about it until recently. She slipped up a couple of times (I know it was her as I saw her eating fish) and left the door open. \n\nThen, one day, we had some pretty important clients coming in. She left the door open and heated up her fish. It stunk up the entire office. Our clients came in and one made a comment on the odor. I try to create an inviting space for people who come into our office. They didn't say anything more but I know it made them uncomfortable. After this incident, another employee who was working with the clients personally told me that she talked to Jane about it and she said she didn't care, no one could stop her from cooking what she wanted.\n\nI checked with the HR company I work with and they said I could make a policy against fish from being heated up in the microwave, as Jane isn't doing it for religious or health reasons. I sent out an e-mail detailing the new policy. It won't come with any disciplinary action, but I will enforce it going forward and will give reminders if it happens again. Jane responded to me privately saying it isn't fair for me to police what she eats at lunch. I said she is welcome to have cold fish at her desk. She could also go home and have lunch. Jane relented.\n\nI was speaking to another business owner friend and she said I was wrong to do this. Even if it's legally okay, I shouldn't dictate what the employees do on their break. In my opinion, it is a communal microwave and office, so it can be monitored.
