{"id": 25549, "submission_id": "161vn6g", "title": "AITA for being the reason my ex's fiance dumped my ex a month before the wedding?", "selftext": "*NOT REAL NAMES*\nSo back story: Basically he is my ex baby daddy if I can even call him that? Me (F22) & Ex (M, 23 lets call him Dan) dated for about 6 months on/off when I was 18 he was 19 Consequently I fell pregnant, and he did did a huge dick move and ghosted me after I told him. Due to a lot of stress from his actions & still living at home, just starting my bachelor's. I had a miscarriage around 12 weeks. I went to tell him but he had deleted and blocked me on everything but Facebook messenger where I message about a month after 'don't worry you're off the hook, I lost the baby. I hope that eases your stress' once I saw he had seen it I blocked him before he could even reply as I didn't want to interact with him. Mind you he never once messaged me before.\nSo his fianc\u00e9 (F21 lets call her Jen) & I had a mutual friend/co-worker. It was their birthday, I went & so did she I did not know that this was Dans fianc\u00e9! Anyways we got to talking and pretty much stuck with each other cause we didn't know anyone else other than mutual friend.  \nWe were talking about our partners, explaining how we met them and all that and somehow the conversation changed from that to our ex's and how horrible things had ended with them. I mentioned my ex and how he ghosted me when I got pregnant and all that. She said that was horrible, and then proceeded to say that it sounded like a similar situation to what her fianc\u00e9 had been in. As his ex \"fell pregnant\" to trap him cause she found out he was going to end things and then had a \"miscarriage\" a while later. \nShe then at one point mentioned his name and I realised who he was & I was the \"fake pregnant\" ex girlfriend!  \nI was livid and since both her and I had been drinking so we were both a little intoxicated at this moment. I went off and started talking absolute shit him and telling her that he lied about me. I even went through my phone to show her proof that I was actually pregnant. As I still had screenshots of ultrasounds and doctors notes on my phone. I even went and showed her the multiple messages I had sent Dan as I never deleted any text messages even the failed to deliver ones as he had blocked me so I couldn't message him. I ended up going home quickly after not giving her the chance to take in everything to respond to what I told her.\nAbout a month later I was getting a bunch of nasty texts from my Dan's friends saying how much of a bitch I am & how dare I stoop so low just to get to him a month before his wedding. I was extremely confused cause I had no clue what was going. I asked what they meant but was obviously blocked as the message never sent. I later got a friend request from Jen as well as a message request from her saying that she had called off the wedding and she apologises for any rude messages I may get as I am the reason they split. Because she didn't want to marry a liar.  \nFeel like im NTA but wanted to share this anyways.", "created_utc": 1693057487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161vn6g/aita_for_being_the_reason_my_exs_fiance_dumped_my/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is what happens when you tell elaborate lies. He got caught and he has to deal with the consequences. You helped the fianc\u00e9e dodge a bullet.", "Not your problem. He's the one that lied to his partner, he ruined the foundation of his marriage all by himself. Good for her for recognizing a red flag and getting out.", "NTA you probably saved her a lot of heartache in the long run and seems like you have a new friend honestly win win situation for you both.", "NTA. She dodged a bullet. Next time one of his friends messages yiu file a police report for harassment. Do it to every one of them. If they keep on then press charges", "NTA\n\nYou just saved that girl a lot of grief.\n\nDan got some good old karma.", "NTA. You saved her from making a huge mistake. The only AH here is your ex and anyone who condones that kind of behaviour. I will always wonder why some people think that it\u2019s ok for them to lie about you, but you\u2019re the AH if you tell the truth about them?", "NTA, this was not something you set out to intentionally do. Karma has an interesting way of working things out.  He made his bed so now he can sleep in it, alone.", "NTA and also not the reason they split. He is. He could not than and even now take responsibility for his own actions. You spoke the truth and what was done with it was out of your hands afterwards. \nI hope you can find freedom from him and move forward. You deserve someone who as me and my sister say \u201ctreats you like a princess, because all girls are princess.\u201d", "NTA.  You aren't the reason the fiance left him.  He is.  His past actions are what they are.  He lied about them, she found out the truth.  His lies and character failures are the reason she left him.", "NTA. He treated you utterly shitty and then had the audacity to lie about you, this is his own actions biting him in the ass. The woman saw the signs on the wall, saw how he treated you and said \"nope, I ain't got no business with this fool\" and rightfully so dumped him. What if she had also gotten pregnant, would he treat her better, or fuck it up too, just like he did with you?", "Oh, I think there is so, so much missing in the backstory. \n\nIn a way, you are both holding onto to \"your truth,\" and I could see how elements of both your stories make sense. \n\nHe very well could have been thinking the relationship had run its course, and you very conveniently fell pregnant\u2014a very old tale. If he was thinking you were manipulative, a liar, or dramatic, for reasons, his story would make sense. \n\nAnd of course, a guy freaking out and leaving his GF when she falls pregnant is also a very old tale. And your actions make sense.\n\nBut since there was no communication between you, he had no inkling of ultrasounds, doctor's notes and such to realize you were telling the truth. And from your story, you were both blocking each other, meaning that communication was a mess. So using evidence that he wasn't aware of to \"prove\" to his fianc\u00e9e that he was lying is... problematic. We have no idea how he would have reacted if given actual proof you weren't just making this up.\n\nAnd why, after realizing who she was, were you so determined to insert yourself into their relationship? Was it to warn her? Or just to get back at him? Why go to all this trouble to clear your name to someone you just met and barely knew? Since your ex was not in any way part of your life anymore?\n\nThat's another thought. The fact that you dated \"off and on\" over a brief period of time suggests this was hardly a \"love of my life\" relationship that suddenly and inexplicably went wrong. \n\nBut anyway. I generally think your side of the \"fake pregnancy/AH boyfriend\" story is closer to the truth, but again without the backstory about your tumultuous relationship I can't be sure. But this just feels like unnecessary drama and mixed motives on everyone's part. ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
