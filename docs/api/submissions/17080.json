We both work full-time so our son is in daycare during the week.  My husband has some PTO to use up before the end of the month and is taking Fridays off because if he doesn't use the PTO time, he loses it.  He's taken every Friday off so far this month and is taking next Friday and the following Thursday and Friday off as well.  \n\nLast night he asked me if I would be willing to drop our son off at daycare so he could stay home.  He does all of the drop-offs because his office is nearby.  My office is in the opposite direction so it's out of my way and would add time to my commute.  I told him it's easier for him to do it and it's not like he has anything going on anyway.  He ended up taking him this morning, but I could tell he wasn't happy about it.\n\nI texted him some things that need to get done around the house and a few errands that need to get done.  He told me that he just wants to enjoy the house to himself for a day and not have an entire list of things to do.  He said he'll clean and do some laundry, but he's going to spend the rest of the day relaxing and the other stuff can wait.  \n\nI told him that those other things can't all be done on the weekend and it's 100 times easier for him to do it on a day off.  Especially since we are going out of town this weekend to visit my family, next weekend I'm out of town with friends, and then Memorial weekend we have plans as well.  We need to take advantage of days off like this so that we don't get too far behind with our busy schedule.  \n\nHe told me that if he knew I was just going to give him a \"honey-do-list\" then he would have just gone to work instead and lost out on his PTO time.  I told him that he's being dramatic and that he would still have some time to relax after he gets things done, even if it's not as much time as he wants.  \n\nHe said he never tells me how to spend my time when I have days off work so I shouldn't do the same for him.  But he doesn't think about all the things that need to get done the way that I do.  He'll clean, walk the dog, and do laundry and think that he's done for the day and go play video games for 6 hours.  \n\nI told him if he just starts now then he will still have some time in the afternoon to relax before getting our son from daycare.  He said \"Oh, so you won't even pick him up?  Gee, good thing I took today off so that I can do everything that YOU want me to do.\"  \n\nI reminded him that he still has days off coming up and that he can use those days to relax if he wants.

Some laundry, cleaning, and dog walking is also reasonable too. A honey do list is too much, and you\u2019re trying to micromanage him.

You are frustrated with your husband because he isn't pulling his weight. This isn't just about one day off. But you are not helping your case by making it seem like a double standard where you get to enjoy trips with your friends with no responsibilities, but your husband doesn't. You need to have a conversation with your husband about how he isn't pulling his weight during his on days. Of course he deserves the occasional lazy day, and you are not making it seem like you recognize that basic need for R+R. But picking a fight with him, trying to micromanage how he allocates his time and energy, and shoving a list at him doesn't seem to be an effective way of communicating your frustration. Maybe marriage counseling is needed. Or maybe you should just dump him since you have so much contempt for him and the relationship is not recoverable. YMMV.", "YTA. But keep reading- having young kids is so so hard. You feel like the whole world is on your shoulders and you can\u2019t keep up. \n\nI think you have a failure to communicate here. Does he feel safe to tell you how burnt out he is? Can you guys look at the list of stuff to do together and figure out what\u2019s manageable, what\u2019s a priority, what can wait. Can you find a compromise where he fills up his bucket and recharges and picks at a couple things from the list that you both agree on? \n\nI empathize with you because I\u2019m a lot like you. I am the alpha of the house always on top of everything that needs to get done. \n\nBut I promise you, it will be better for your marriage and your house if you can find a balance of things that you are each responsible for and then agree on the definition of \u201cgood enough\u201d or \u201cdone\u201d for each job or project in advance so you aren\u2019t babysitting the work and he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s living in a nanny state.", "YTA.

ESH", "I didn't really see that in the post...he was already going to clean, and it was him asking her to take care of drop off, not the other way around...\n\nOP said in a comment that the stuff she wanted done were groceries and returning packages, and that she'd previously asked he build a chicken coop which she had bought herself. \n\nI'm AFAB, not trying to make excuses for the guy, but I got the vibe that maybe you were projecting a little on the response.", "OP has days where she chooses what to do. OP says in her post:\n\n>He said he never tells me how to spend my time when I have days off work so I shouldn't do the same for him.\n\nAlso:\n\n>next weekend I'm out of town with friends", "> Why isn\u2019t he staying home with your husband anyway, if he\u2019s not working?\n\nWe have limited vacation days from daycare, so even if our son stayed home we would still be paying for the day.  And my husband's excuse is that if he's home with our son he doesn't get a chance to actually relax and feel like he has time for himself.", "Why would he want to stay home when she says he'll give him a free day the next day off but has proven otherwise.", "That sounds like a fucking nightmare, where people crash and burn after a couple months", "Honestly, I don't think that's the kind of flex you think it is.", "FYI, this comment doesn\u2019t make you look any better. Not going to bother explaining why", "I get the feeling you\u2019d be worth breaking rule #1", "I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s plenty of things you could be doing instead of hanging out with friends that weekend you have planned. So why do you get time off and he doesn\u2019t?", "So you're OK with the mother taking days off to go with her friends?", "Instead of going away with your friends next weekend, why don't you do those things? Why do you get time off to have fun and relax but he has to do chores?", ">I told him that those other things can't all be done on the weekend and it's 100 times easier for him to do it on a day off. \n\nIt sounds more like you were giving him a list of things that *had* to be done that day. If you weren't expecting him to do all of it, then it might have been better to give him a list and ask him to take care of a few of those things. You didn't make it sound at all like you would be willing to wait on the errands you were giving him.", "I am not sure why you would even mention things to do if you weren't expecting him to do them. Prioritize your list and eliminate things that aren't urgent. You would have received a lot less pushback if you had just asked for him to do the most important thing, like, say, pick up some groceries. Really, when anyone requests that their significant other run some errands, a list of four or five things to do looks a lot worse than a single request.", "You should get a maid if you're going to be that controlling about what should be getting done when you don't even appear to be doing any of it. At least a maid would be getting paid. YTA.", "I'm sorry, but how is that an issue for any of those tasks? Unless your laundry is invisible, or your grass doesn't grow, seeing when it needs to be done is exactly how most people decide to do it. Sounds like you just love to criticize your husband. Poor guy.", "Then, IMO it would make more sense to keep a list of chores out that he can see more easily. I think the biggest reason he was upset is he had a plan for the day in his mind, and the way you went about this completely undermined that for him. I feel like he wouldn\u2019t be nearly as upset if you both had talked about this earlier on, rather than sending it to him on the day of his PTO.\n\nTo help explain my perspective, imagine you just finished working and are about to sit down. And the moment before you sat, someone calls you over with more work. It would irk you, you were just about to relax and it got ruined. Now, accounting for your chicken coop story, imagine it kept happening and you never got to just sit, wouldn\u2019t that be a bit frustrating?\n\nESH because he could probably be more helpful, but also sending a list of errands on the day of his PTO is really inconsiderate as well, because it shows you aren\u2019t taking his plans into account. Even if his plans are just \u201cplaying video games all day\u201d they still count as plans and it\u2019s rude to steamroll through them with no consideration or conversation.", "You sounds like a dictator. He probably hates his life.", "Not to be mean or rude, but I'm sure you let him know he could've done it all by himself.", "Why didn\u2019t you just wait until you got home and do it yourself?", "So you do always have a list. Even if it\u2019s just something.", "This is where you lost me. I get my partner roped into all sorts of DIY projects and sure there\u2019s a lot where either of us could do it alone, but it\u2019s so much easier to do it with it partner. \n\nYou\u2019re supposed to be collaboratively working towards shared goals. Don\u2019t text him a to do list, have a face to face conversation about expectations/needs regarding PTO use. Talk about what\u2019s on the household to do list and what\u2019s a reasonable time frame for tasks to get done, come to that decision together.", "As someone who built a chicken coop last weekend, YTA.  I needed my SO's help more than once with putting the coop together.  It's not necessarily easy, and it still took the two of us a couple hours. Why don't you take some PTO and get your own honey do list done?", "What if he told her she can't have the weekend away with her friends anymore because there's too much to do during the week that she can't take the weekend off?", "My thoughts exactly. Clearly OP is not able to advocate for themselves because they are so overwhelmed with the unequal division of hermeneutical labor.", "Not projecting at all, my bf is a phenomenal partner who is really active in the maintenance of our household. I\u2019m looking at exactly what she said \n\n- he didn\u2019t want to take their kid to daycare cus he didn\u2019t wanna get up, but it\u2019s out of her way and adds time to her commute. \n- he was going to do some chores that needed doing but didn\u2019t want to do any additional errands that needed to get done even though it was really the only time over the next several weeks that would\u2019ve been convenient for those things to happen.\n- he complained that she was dictating how he spends his time and then says he doesn\u2019t do that to her, but she clarifies that he doesn\u2019t need to tell her what needs to be done because she inherently knows those things \u2014 this is a very common issue in relationships where women are constantly carrying the mental load of household management and men pull the \u201cwell I\u2019d do it if you just ask me\u201d card", "Like I said, I\u2019m assuming he doesn\u2019t give her a list because she takes care of what needs done without being asked. \n\nIt is good she\u2019s getting a weekend to herself as well. But he\u2019s taking more than twice that time off over the span of the month. Also like I said, he can still get shit done and have a lot of free time too.", "How often do you have lazy days all to yourself?", "So he\u2019s upset that he has to parent. Omg.", "Bc he\u2019s a fully grown man. I cannot imagine having the day off work and my spouse asking me for help with errands while they go to work and me saying no. I\u2019m reading these comments thanking God for a husband who actively offers to help me on his days off for the good of our family.", "Way to alienate the ONE person who agrees with you. LOL you\u2019re not very bright, are you?", "My paycheck says otherwise. It\u2019s okay \ud83d\ude02\nAlso, I don\u2019t need to flex I\u2019m not the one asking strangers opinions", "Or does it make her husband look even worse... guess it depends on where your biases are", "You're comparing the well in advanced plans she's made for a weekend away to the spontaneous day of relaxing the husband tried to make when shit needed to get done?", "I'd love to see the answer to this myself, but based on the other comments, I suspect this inquiry will be conveniently overlooked.\n\nYTA OP.", "I've been planning this weekend away for months.  Things have been planned and paid for.  It's not the same as sitting around the house doing nothing.", "You can just call her Gladis Kravitz", "Not very often because on the rare day I have home by myself I am using that time to get stuff done.", "And.... No adult ever needs a total day off for their mental and physical health?  One day off she made him put a chicken coop together.   If I know that I'm leaving for a weekend and we have plans for every other weekend, I'm going to let my husband have his day off work to do whatever he wants.  I guess that's why we're happily married, allowing for time to destress.", "Sauce for the goose, friend.   Both are entitled to time off, and she's taking an entire freaking weekend.  He should be given his day - especially since he doesn't dump \"Honey Dew\" texts on her when she's on PTO.", "So answer the question, why do you get time off to relax and he has to do chores?", "The good old \"because I said so\" argument stopper got it.\n\n>I've been planning this weekend away for months. Things have been planned and paid for. It's not the same as sitting around the house doing nothing.\n\nYou knew months ago this stuff needed to get done. You had months to get your \"must get done in a single day\" list complete.", "Yeah, that was my assumption. I don\u2019t really care if I\u2019m downvoted, you\u2019re NTA. It sounds like you take on most/all of the mental load.", "Yes he should be given a day, a day with more notice so he can have a day to relax. And hes not sending to do lists cause he has no idea what needs doing.", "This trip will be the first time I'm out of the house with friends in way too long.", "He's taking off every Friday for the month.   This wasn't a last minute thing; his wife knows his PTO schedule. \n\nAnd given his statement about him being sure she'll find things for him to do on the upcoming weekends, it sounds VERY MUCH like she has a history of giving him chores to do whenever he takes a day off.", "So your free time is more important than his?"]}
