He's taken every Friday off so far this month and is taking next Friday and the following Thursday and Friday off as well.  \n\nLast night he asked me if I would be willing to drop our son off at daycare so he could stay home.  He does all of the drop-offs because his office is nearby.  My office is in the opposite direction so it's out of my way and would add time to my commute.  I told him it's easier for him to do it and it's not like he has anything going on anyway.  He ended up taking him this morning, but I could tell he wasn't happy about it.\n\nI texted him some things that need to get done around the house and a few errands that need to get done.  He told me that he just wants to enjoy the house to himself for a day and not have an entire list of things to do.  He said he'll clean and do some laundry, but he's going to spend the rest of the day relaxing and the other stuff can wait.  \n\nI told him that those other things can't all be done on the weekend and it's 100 times easier for him to do it on a day off.  Especially since we are going out of town this weekend to visit my family, next weekend I'm out of town with friends, and then Memorial weekend we have plans as well.  We need to take advantage of days off like this so that we don't get too far behind with our busy schedule.  \n\nHe told me that if he knew I was just going to give him a \"honey-do-list\" then he would have just gone to work instead and lost out on his PTO time.  I told him that he's being dramatic and that he would still have some time to relax after he gets things done, even if it's not as much time as he wants.  \n\nHe said he never tells me how to spend my time when I have days off work so I shouldn't do the same for him.  But he doesn't think about all the things that need to get done the way that I do.  He'll clean, walk the dog, and do laundry and think that he's done for the day and go play video games for 6 hours.  \n\nI told him if he just starts now then he will still have some time in the afternoon to relax before getting our son from daycare.  He said \"Oh, so you won't even pick him up?  Gee, good thing I took today off so that I can do everything that YOU want me to do.\"  \n\nI reminded him that he still has days off coming up and that he can use those days to relax if he wants.

You are frustrated with your husband because he isn't pulling his weight. This isn't just about one day off. But you are not helping your case by making it seem like a double standard where you get to enjoy trips with your friends with no responsibilities, but your husband doesn't. You need to have a conversation with your husband about how he isn't pulling his weight during his on days. Of course he deserves the occasional lazy day, and you are not making it seem like you recognize that basic need for R+R. But picking a fight with him, trying to micromanage how he allocates his time and energy, and shoving a list at him doesn't seem to be an effective way of communicating your frustration. Maybe marriage counseling is needed. Or maybe you should just dump him since you have so much contempt for him and the relationship is not recoverable. YMMV.", "YTA. But keep reading- having young kids is so so hard. You feel like the whole world is on your shoulders and you can\u2019t keep up. \n\nI think you have a failure to communicate here. Does he feel safe to tell you how burnt out he is? Can you guys look at the list of stuff to do together and figure out what\u2019s manageable, what\u2019s a priority, what can wait. Can you find a compromise where he fills up his bucket and recharges and picks at a couple things from the list that you both agree on? \n\nI empathize with you because I\u2019m a lot like you. I am the alpha of the house always on top of everything that needs to get done. \n\nBut I promise you, it will be better for your marriage and your house if you can find a balance of things that you are each responsible for and then agree on the definition of \u201cgood enough\u201d or \u201cdone\u201d for each job or project in advance so you aren\u2019t babysitting the work and he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s living in a nanny state.", "YTA.
