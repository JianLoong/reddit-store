{"id": 16604, "submission_id": "13ad2ij", "title": "AITA or restricting my stepdaughter's sugary food intake while she stays with us?", "selftext": "I (33F) am a stepmom to a wonderful 13-year-old girl, who I'll call Sarah, from my husband's (40M) previous marriage. My husband and I have a 10-year-old son together, and we have a specific diet for him that is low in sugar and processed foods. I follow the same diet as well.\n\nRecently, Sarah came to stay with us for a few weeks during her school break. I explained to her that while she's here, we have a specific diet for our family that's low in sugar and that she's only allowed to eat fruit and honey as sweeteners. I also mentioned that this is to keep my son on track with his diet, as he can get jealous if others around him are eating sugary foods.\n\nSarah became very angry at me and accused me of being unfair and controlling. She said that she's never been restricted from eating sugary foods before, and that it's not fair for her to have to follow our family's diet. I tried to explain to her that we're doing what's best for our son, and that it's important for him to stick to his diet for his health. I also offered to find alternative snacks that she might enjoy, but she refused. She made offensive comments about  and stormed off to her room.\n\nI went up and tried to talk to her and she then  tried to spit at me in a fit of rage. I am completely taken aback by her manner. I understand that she might be frustrated with the diet restrictions, but her behaviour r was completely unacceptable.\n\nDespite my attempts to reason with her and find a solution that works for everyone, she remained adamant and refused to follow our family's diet. In the end, she decided to go back to her mom's house, cutting short her stay with us.\n\nI feel saddened that our relationship has been strained because of this incident. As a stepmom, I genuinely care about Sarah and want to build a positive relationship with her, but her reaction to our family's dietary choices has made that difficult.\n\nI want to make it clear that I have no intention of controlling or restricting Sarah's choices, but as a parent, it's my responsibility to ensure that my son's diet is in line with his needs. I hope that Sarah will understand our perspective and come back to visit us soon. \n\nTL;DR: I'm a stepmom who follows a low-sugar diet for my son and myself. When my stepdaughter came to stay with us, I asked her to follow the same diet while she was here. She became angry and refused, even trying to spit at me. She decided to leave and go back to her mom's house. I understand her frustration, but as a parent, I have a responsibility to my son's health.

Instead, she'll always remember her visit as the time her dad's wife tried to control her. \n\nI hope to God that Sarah doesn't feel insecure about her body. Because if she does, then she will have interpreted your 'rules' as an insult, and you could have compounded on some seriously harmful body image issues. Young teenage girls are at such a difficult time with all their hormones running rampant. Add in the pressures of social media and how they compare themselves to celebrities. It's no wonder eating disorders and problems like body dysmorphia are so common. If you're going to talk to a 13 Yr old girl about diet, you need to approach the topic extremely carefully, from a place of love & concern.", "INFO: Where is your husband in all of this?", "Yta\n\nIt's mind boggling that you would lead with this in your relationship with her. Why would you not start with \"I want you to feel at home, anything you want me to add to the grocery list\"\" and then do some reasonable editing when you go the store. \n\nAlso does your son go to school? He must see other kids eat different diets all the time. \n\nWhen you add a child into your home you all have to make room for them.", "INFO is your son on this diet for a specific medical reason? You do know an extremely restrictive diet like this will make sugar such a novelty for him that he'll go haywire on it as soon as he's able to, yes?", "YTA. I notice that you're careful, multiple times, to say you and your son are on this diet (for reasons you never really explain). You never mention what your husband eats. I think that's intentional.\r  \n\r  \nThat you're on a power trip is evident throughout the post.  You find stepdaughter in your power, and you immediately dictate what she will do and don't even try to reason or compromise with her. You even use owning the home for leverage over your husband.\r  \n\r  \nStepdaughter is 13, and you're restricting her bodily autonomy for no good reason. She has rightly bailed out from your controlling behavior. \r  \n\r  \nThis is not about the diet, not about the Iranian yogurt, it\u2019s about control. I\u2019m very confident that if she wasn\u2019t able to bail out, you\u2019d find other restrictions to set \u201cfor her own good\u201d.", ">I have no intention of controlling or restricting Sarah's choices\n\n...did you read your own title there OP?\n\nYTA for making this an issue to begin with. It's your house, she's going to be there for whatever agreed upon time, and all you had to do was literally just let her live her life. Instead, you decided that it was necessary to pull her aside and have a weird conversation where you explained to her how 'she's going to follow this diet in your house'. Why? \n\nWhen you are over someone's house, you eat whatever food is available. If she goes into the cupboard and she doesn't find cookies, then there are no cookies for her to eat and she's not going to eat any because they don't exist. And then, even if she had asked you politely, \"hey, are there any cookies?\" you literally could have just explained, \"no, we don't eat cookies, typically we stick with things like fruit when we're looking for something sweet\", and then offer her a piece of fruit or some alternatives depending on what you have in the house. Either way, it sounds like you decided that you needed to tell her specifically that you're going to be restricting her diet while she is there and I don't blame her for leaving after that.", "INFO: Has Sarah never stayed with you before? Or is this diet a new thing? If you've always eaten this way she shouldn't have been surprised.", "YTA. \n\nWhy wasn't this discussed with her prior to her visit?  Why wait until she is there and then throw at her that she has to restrict her diet because you are choosing to do so for you and your son (I say choose because you said it is a choice). \n\nAlso, fruit has a ton of sugar in it. So if you are avoiding sugar for your son that is an epic fail.", "YTA\n\n\nLike huh? \n\n>I want to make it clear that I have no intention of controlling or restricting Sarah's choices, but as a parent, it's my responsibility to ensure that my son's diet is in line with his needs. I hope that Sarah will understand our perspective and come back to visit us soon. \n\nIt sounds like you *do* wanna restrict her choices. You don't all have to eat the same things. Sarah doesn't even have to eat all her food/snacks around you or your son. I could understand you just saying your wouldn't be buying x or have it available in the household but to prevent her from eating stuff is a bit much. \n\nThen that whole house comment was ridiculous. That's your husband's child he should have final say.

Quit trying to control her.", "Lol \"I have no intention of controlling her diet\" while you control her diet at your house. Look, you and ur husband are the parents. If u tell them they have to eat ramen and spam daily then that's what they eat while they're with you. But bringing a kid into those restrictions who unlike your son, comes from a household with no such restrictions and it's unsurprising you're gonna get massive push back from a teen. And framing things as \" I have to help my son stay on his diet I've forced him on to so you also have to suffer\" is kind of an asshole move. Because the kid I really love has to do this, you have to sacrifice to help him stay on track. Again, these are kids so you can command them. But imagine saying to an adult \"you can't go to burger king for the next month because johnny's on a diet.\" Most adults would tell you off just like your teen did.", "Wow, you can't even keep your story straight in one post.\n\n>I want to make it clear that I have no intention of controlling or restricting Sarah's choices  \n>  \n>I explained to her that while she's here, we have a specific diet for our family that's low in sugar and that she's only allowed to eat fruit and honey as sweeteners.\n\nYou're talking out of both side of your mouth there.\n\nYou have a responsibility to parent your son.  Period.  That means that if he gets jealous, you deal with it like a parent - you don't control other people to make it so you don't have to deal with his jealousy.\n\nI'm also confused why you had to go on a control trip and make this a big deal from the get go.  Did she get to your house, open the cupboard, and go on a rampage when she couldn't find a five pound bag of sugar to eat for dinner?  If your whole household allegedly keeps to this diet, then a) there wouldn't be any of the \"offending\" food items for her to eat anyway, and b) you would just make meals within the diet like any ordinary day of the week and she'd eat it and be none the wiser that you decided to make dinner without white sugar because it's just the norm.  No strange lectures with controlling overtones necessary.  So the fact that you could have done this, but instead opted to approach it the weird controlling lecture way means you were on a power trip making sure she knew she had to bend herself to you and not the other way around.\n\nYTA.", "\u201cDespite my attempts to find a solution that worked for everyone\u201d uhhh\u2026 when did you do that? \n\nI\u2019m so pro not feeding ur kids sugars and processed foods but the way you act is actually not healthy bc of the controlling and rigidness. Teaching your child how to be healthy isn\u2019t solely about the food they put in, it\u2019s also about their attitude, and relationship to foods. \n\nI understand you have good intentions but you are misguided and YTA. Not to diagnose but maybe talk to a therapist/nutritionist about orthorexia.\n\nEdit: after reading your comments you are so beyond the Asshole. You actually don\u2019t have good intentions and you\u2019re just on a power trip and forcing your own unaddressed issues on people with less power. It\u2019s actually disgusting and the comments on here are insufferable. YTA YTA YTA", "YTA for trying to force a restrictive diet on a teenage girl and putting the last nail in the coffin of her dad's relationship with her. Was that deliberate?", "YTA. A healthy diet and relationship with food is not a restrictive one. \n\nAs someone on the spectrum, I can inform you that a bit of sugar never harmed me, and restricting it didn\u2019t change a damn thing. \n\nPeople who think diet changes autism make me tired.", "YTA. You're the crazy stepmother, and going to be a wedge between her and her father.", "As a parent, feel free to help your son with his dietary needs.\n\nAs a parent, you should know better than to place his restrictions on anyone else. Epic fail.\n\nYTA", "YTA It doesn't sound like there's a medical reason for your son's diet so he's probably going to grow up and spend the rest of his life eating nothing but candy. If there is an actual reason he needs this diet, you could have handled this better, like asking stepdaughter to keep sugary snacks in her room and not eat them in front if your son.", "YTA. What you are doing IS controlling and restricting her choices. And if you say your son gets jealous when he sees others eating what he can\u2019t have- as soon as he\u2019s old enough and you\u2019re not around he\u2019s going to binge on all those things.", "YTA. For multiple reasons.  First you aren\u2019t the parent and yet you are trying to discipline her like you are. Restricting a child\u2019s diet, while sometimes necessary, is a form of control or discipline over that child and should be done by a parent.  If your husband agreed with your plan then that should have been a conversation between your husband and his daughter.  And probably should have included her mom as well.  If your husband agreed with your plan and left it to you to tell her then he is an AH too.  Did he know what you intended to do?or did you have the conversation without his knowledge.  \n\nWhat she heard is that life in your household is centered entirely around your sons needs, whether it is what she wants or is used to, and she has to go along because he is more important.\n\nFinally, teenage girls are the most vulnerable creatures on earth when it comes to body image.  And girls with body image issues are very prone to eating disorders that can cause major health risks for the rest of their lives.  So you also let her know that she doesn\u2019t eat healthy (at least in your mind) which she could easily take to mean there is something wrong with her body.  Again any conversation about a teenage girl that involves food, diet,  \u201chealth\u201d , should be handled carefully, by an actual parent.", "Why did you mention it at all?  Kids eat what\u2019s in the house - if she then says hey do you have any chocolate you say, oh sorry no, we don\u2019t tend to have that sort of thing.

Would you impose to you son to quit his sport and not practicing any sport that requires running from this point forward, so your step daughter doesn't get more frustrated or sad? It doesn't make any sense so why would it be okay the other way around regarding food?    \n    \n\nTeach your step daughter to be compassionate enough to not rub it in your son's face and teach your son to accept his situation and that it does not define him. Teach him to take the time to adapt, learn new ways and how to make peace with it, because when he'll get older, the world around him will not adapt to fit his needs and teaching him to have the tools to face this reality will be a great gift to give him.", "YTA, so many ways to make this work, just not the way you did it. \nExplain to son that guests arent on diet.\nExplain to SD that you would prefer and respect her to eat \u2018bad\u2019food discretely or not infront of son, basically asking the SD to do you a favour.(and then praise her for that)", "Lol.

My husband and I have a 10-year-old son together, and we have a specific diet for him that is low in sugar and processed foods. I follow the same diet as well.\n\nRecently, Sarah came to stay with us for a few weeks during her school break. I explained to her that while she's here, we have a specific diet for our family that's low in sugar and that she's only allowed to eat fruit and honey as sweeteners. I also mentioned that this is to keep my son on track with his diet, as he can get jealous if others around him are eating sugary foods.\n\nSarah became very angry at me and accused me of being unfair and controlling. She said that she's never been restricted from eating sugary foods before, and that it's not fair for her to have to follow our family's diet. I tried to explain to her that we're doing what's best for our son, and that it's important for him to stick to his diet for his health. I also offered to find alternative snacks that she might enjoy, but she refused. She made offensive comments about  and stormed off to her room.\n\nI went up and tried to talk to her and she then  tried to spit at me in a fit of rage. I am completely taken aback by her manner. I understand that she might be frustrated with the diet restrictions, but her behaviour r was completely unacceptable.\n\nDespite my attempts to reason with her and find a solution that works for everyone, she remained adamant and refused to follow our family's diet. In the end, she decided to go back to her mom's house, cutting short her stay with us.\n\nI feel saddened that our relationship has been strained because of this incident. As a stepmom, I genuinely care about Sarah and want to build a positive relationship with her, but her reaction to our family's dietary choices has made that difficult.\n\nI want to make it clear that I have no intention of controlling or restricting Sarah's choices, but as a parent, it's my responsibility to ensure that my son's diet is in line with his needs. I hope that Sarah will understand our perspective and come back to visit us soon. \n\nTL;DR: I'm a stepmom who follows a low-sugar diet for my son and myself. When my stepdaughter came to stay with us, I asked her to follow the same diet while she was here. She became angry and refused, even trying to spit at me. She decided to leave and go back to her mom's house. I understand her frustration, but as a parent, I have a responsibility to my son's health.

The issue is not to not eat processed sugar, it is no debate that natural sugar coming from fruit is more healthy to eat than processed sugar, the issue comes from what we call cognitive restriction, which is when we (or the parental figure) label some type of food as forbidden when fhe kids are young or teens. It creates a separate category of food for these forbidden \"fruits\" (pun intended) which will most likely make her step daughter the crave what she can't have, craving intensified by the frustration and the urge of rebellion teenagers tend to have towards their parents rules. When the step daughter will reach an age where she can decide what she eats, this cognitive restriction will come bite her in the ass because financial freedom and freedom of choice on what to eat will open the realm of this forbidden food and make it accessible all the time, leading to the natural reverse effect of restriction : excess.   \n   \nUnless it is a medical necessity, food restriction does at least as much damage as food excess (or excess of bad sugar etc...) , it's just a ticking time bomb. What OP could do though instead of restricting food is to find a way to teach her step daughger the taste and value of more healthy food and how moderation grow and what food diversity is. Knowing that she could eat processed food if she really want to, will probably make the step daughter more open to eat the more healthy diet from time to time, and maybe more and more, since no craving is created.   \n   \nOn another point, I do understand the will to be supportive to OP's son, however it is unfair for the step daughter. Equality cannot apply here. Equity is the way to go. If the step daughter had been amputated of one of her legs and was not able to practice any kind of sports/activities requiring running, would OP forbid her son to practice any of these sports too in support of the step daughter? Tha'd be ridiculous and totally uneffective.    \n    \nSo why should the other way around be okay? For a start, the kid with no medical issues will probably resent the other one to have to suffer \"because\" of him/her (keep in mind we are dealing with kids here), then, in return, the kid with medical issues could feel bitter towards the sibling too for wasting a good health (\"you can run and you don't do it?
