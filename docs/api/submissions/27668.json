In the last few months, we got some new sex stuff (not crazy, just like restraints and handcuffs). I put them in a separate small box and on top wrote \"Private: Do Not Open.\" My mom and stepdad were very respectful of my privacy by letting me put it in the moving truck and were very good about not asking or touching the box. When we finished moving my stuff that day, my bf and I got food while they headed home and put my boxes in my room.\n\nIt's been two months and I've moved some of the boxes around now that I'm finally fully settling in. This morning while my family was at work, I noticed the private box had been tampered with. I immediately asked my mom because she's the only person I think would look, and after a few minutes of denial, she tells me that she did in fact look. She said she wanted to know if I was doing drugs, but when she saw the contents, closed it back up and didn't say a word to anyone.\n\nToday, I had my aunt to administer my birth control shot since she is a nurse, and when I got home, my mom was with said aunt on speaker phone and said, \"Yeah, she just got back from meeting you,\" to which my aunt made a joke to my mom about my bf and I using our sex stuff now that I got my shot. My mom immediately took it off of speaker and told my aunt she'd have to call her back. \n\nI ask my mom what that was about and became super angry and embarrassed. My mom tells me that she has a right to look through my things regardless of how old I am, especially if I'm living under her roof. I say that that's an invasion of privacy and there should be a mutual respect between two adults, but she said that I will never receive \"full privacy\" as an adult because she is my mom.\n\nHere's where I fear I may have been the asshole. I then told her that that attitude is exactly why I never opened up to her about traumas and why my 16y/o sister also doesn't either. I told her that because she always tells other people business we confide in her about or that she finds out by snooping, is a big reason I've stopped telling her what's going on in my life outside of what she absolutely needs to know. \n\nShe got super upset and started crying and said that I was an asshole for taking things that far because all she wanted to do was make sure I wasn't doing any drugs or anything illegal. I told her that even if I was, it's not her place to go through my things that I clearly said were private, even if she is a parent. I also said that if I was doing things that were illegal, I would be way more inclined to tell her if she didn't tell everybody else my business. \n\nMy stepdad said that I was kind of an asshole for telling her that she was the reason we didn't open up to her and made her feel like she was a bad mother, but my sister said it's the truth and what she needed to hear.

Your mom is and so is your step dad. No spouse should defend the other in wrong doing. Just quietly support improvement and be honest and life goes on around you much more smoothly, maybe? Sad part is, I don't see her developing a new respect for your boundaries. She thinks she can do whatever she wants because your are HER daughter and its HER house?\n\nI'd go all in and tell them both the truth: Your defense doesn't even meet the basic litmus test that an adult is entitled to a measure of privacy and autonomy.

The first is to look for a tool, screwdriver, hammer, pliers, etc, because he keeps those in a tool box in his room, and I do this WITH his permission. \"Hey, SS, were is <tool>?\" \"Go look in tool box in my room\". The other reason is because he's fallen asleep with the light on. So I get the dog in his bed and the turn out the light. I would never think about snooping in his room.

Treating you like a child who needs supervision, guidance and protection is absurd, particularly because they weren't around to rescue you daily when you were away at school. \n\nYou can walk and chew gum at the same time. Them reassuming control is about their comfort level with your adulthood. It has nothing to do with you underperforming as a grown up.", "Maybe, but that's a long way inthe future.", "Good thing I wasn't telling her what to do, then.", "If you still live with parents they are never going to really treat you as an adult. Parents tend to see their kids as just that, their little children who they fed and took care of. \n\nMoving away from parents helps set up healthier boundaries with parents but that doesn't always work either. My grandmother still treats my dad like a little kid and she's pushing 90.", "Yup, that\u2019s unethical of your aunt to do.", ">She doesn't need to cut her mom out of her life, ffs.\n\nYou literally told her what she should and shouldn't be doing.", "She doesn't \"still live with parents\", she moved back in.", "The aunt has a supply of birth control shots lying around?\n\nStop doing that. Your aunt is not your doctor  and if something ever goes wrong, you won't be covered by your insurance and your aunt could lose her license.\n\nInsurance might suck but trying to take the cheap way out could backfire. Pay out of pocket or find a different cheaper method.", "I *literally* did not do anything of the sort.  The person I responded to advised her to go full NC.  I said that *she didn't need to do that*.  Not needing to take the most ridiculously extreme action is not the same as needing to do anything.", "\"doesn't need to\" doesn't mean \"needs to not\". Read better, ffs,", "Which is living with her parents. You can't be expected to be treated like an adult by your own parents in their own house. They are going to pry and be annoying because that is what parents generally do. You are never really going to be anything but their little kid if you are living in their house with them.", "Maybe you can buy the medicine in a pharmacy and aunt only administeres a shot .", ">I said that   \n>  \n>she didn't need to do that  \n>  \n>.  Not needing to take the most ridiculously extreme action is not the same as needing to do anything.\n\nWhy are you telling her what she doesn't need to do? Why is that your call?", "**You don't need** to respond, thanks."]}
