In the last few months, we got some new sex stuff (not crazy, just like restraints and handcuffs). I put them in a separate small box and on top wrote \"Private: Do Not Open.\" My mom and stepdad were very respectful of my privacy by letting me put it in the moving truck and were very good about not asking or touching the box. When we finished moving my stuff that day, my bf and I got food while they headed home and put my boxes in my room.\n\nIt's been two months and I've moved some of the boxes around now that I'm finally fully settling in. This morning while my family was at work, I noticed the private box had been tampered with. I immediately asked my mom because she's the only person I think would look, and after a few minutes of denial, she tells me that she did in fact look. She said she wanted to know if I was doing drugs, but when she saw the contents, closed it back up and didn't say a word to anyone.\n\nToday, I had my aunt to administer my birth control shot since she is a nurse, and when I got home, my mom was with said aunt on speaker phone and said, \"Yeah, she just got back from meeting you,\" to which my aunt made a joke to my mom about my bf and I using our sex stuff now that I got my shot. My mom immediately took it off of speaker and told my aunt she'd have to call her back. \n\nI ask my mom what that was about and became super angry and embarrassed. My mom tells me that she has a right to look through my things regardless of how old I am, especially if I'm living under her roof. I say that that's an invasion of privacy and there should be a mutual respect between two adults, but she said that I will never receive \"full privacy\" as an adult because she is my mom.\n\nHere's where I fear I may have been the asshole. I then told her that that attitude is exactly why I never opened up to her about traumas and why my 16y/o sister also doesn't either. I told her that because she always tells other people business we confide in her about or that she finds out by snooping, is a big reason I've stopped telling her what's going on in my life outside of what she absolutely needs to know. \n\nShe got super upset and started crying and said that I was an asshole for taking things that far because all she wanted to do was make sure I wasn't doing any drugs or anything illegal. I told her that even if I was, it's not her place to go through my things that I clearly said were private, even if she is a parent. I also said that if I was doing things that were illegal, I would be way more inclined to tell her if she didn't tell everybody else my business. \n\nMy stepdad said that I was kind of an asshole for telling her that she was the reason we didn't open up to her and made her feel like she was a bad mother, but my sister said it's the truth and what she needed to hear.

Your mom is and so is your step dad. No spouse should defend the other in wrong doing. Just quietly support improvement and be honest and life goes on around you much more smoothly, maybe? Sad part is, I don't see her developing a new respect for your boundaries. She thinks she can do whatever she wants because your are HER daughter and its HER house?\n\nI'd go all in and tell them both the truth: Your defense doesn't even meet the basic litmus test that an adult is entitled to a measure of privacy and autonomy.

The other reason is because he's fallen asleep with the light on. So I get the dog in his bed and the turn out the light. I would never think about snooping in his room.

You do realize that writing \u201cPrivate: Do Not Open\u201d was like issuing a challenge for her to see what was inside?  Next time you see her ask her what she wants to know? Your favorite positions? Or how about ask her where she keeps her toys? What about her drug use? Does she cheat on her husband? I mean if you can\u2019t expect privacy and boundaries, why should she?", "NTA but just letting you know parents like your mum are never ever going to see you as an adult. You moving back home no matter your actual reason just reinforced that for her.", "NTA she needed to be put in her place. She needs to stay away from your stuff and out of your business. Moving back in seems like it was a huge mistake. Buy a lock and key for your bedroom until you move out again", "NTA. Invading your privacy was bad enough, but then to blab about what she found? Not on at all, and she needed to be told.", "NTA", "NTA. Look I get a parent looking in to a box marked \u201cprivate\u201d or whatever, because yeah you want to make sure your kid isn\u2019t doing drugs. The problem here is your mom\u2019s mouth.", "NTA.\n\nIt's the truth though and unfortunately, she's wonder why you and your sister don't talk to her at all, even though the answer is in her own words:  \n\n\n>she said that I will never receive \"full privacy\" as an adult because she is my mom.", "NTA.\n\nYour mum is a boundary stomper and and what she did is gross (both the snooping and the gossiping). Your stepdad is her enabler. The chances that they will see the error of their ways are miniscule. Don't count on it happening.\n\nYou will never get privacy living in her house, and for me no amount of money saved would be worth the constant violation of trust.\n\nIf you can at all, move out, go LC with her, and put her back on an information diet.", "NTA Also your aunt violated HIPPA, get someone else to do the shot next time.", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t lie.  I would never do what she did to my adult kids.  And would never discuss anything that private with others!", "NTA.", "NTA. You have every right to privacy, regardless of whether or not you are living under your mother's roof.\n\nI'm not going to totally advocate you completely cutting your mother out, but I would continue the information diet and make it clear that you cannot trust her. It's not that she's a bad mother. (I'm not going to comment on what kind of mother she is because I don't know what she's like outside of this issue in your post.) It's that she can't be trusted with any information, regardless of how sensitive that information is. Her first instinct is to blab to anyone, particularly other family members by the sound of it. Continue the information diet. Only tell her what she absolutely needs to know; and even then, do the bare minimum where possible. (And maybe information that you wouldn't care if it got shared around.)\n\nMake it clear to your mother that you don't trust her and she will have to work hard to build the trust in your relationship. Trust is an important aspect of any relationship, including a mother-daughter relationship. She's the one who fractured the relationship. So, she should be the one putting in the work to mend it.", "NTA \n\nMy mom is the same way. Now I call her once per quarter or so. And she gets no information from me. This is why parents get responses like \u201cgood. Fine.\u201d From kids. Because parents don\u2019t view their children as people deserving of having their own lives.", "NTA\n\nAlso don\u2019t listen to the people here saying you should cut off all contact or whatever.  Have a conversation about it and try to heal", "Your mom is being unreasonable. You are gaining from her life by living with her for free. Deal with it and if you dont like it move out. \n\nRepair relationship with your mom. Sounds like she cares and has a hard time communicating. Dont aggrivate that problem.", "While I agree NTA, it's absurd to say she should cut her mother out of her life for this. \n\nYes, she should keep confidences to herself, and she shouldn't snoop through her daughter's things. But you think that means she should cut her mother out of her life?? Really?  How myopic that is, how lacking in nuance, how...black and white.", "Don\u2019t forget the HIPPA violation by her aunt", "Just because OP lives with her mother, that doesn't mean her mother has the right to snoop through her belongings. She should have been an adult and spoke with her if she had concerns. The reality is, her being worried about drugs was more than likely just an excuse to try and get away with her snooping. \n\nHer mother clearly knew she was in the wrong considering she immediately hung up her phone call. Do you think it is appropriate to gossip about your adult childs sex life? Or anyone's sex life? \n\nEverything OP has said makes it seem obvious the mother knew why OP and her sister don't confide in her. The mother is insanely entitled to think her daughters don't have a right to privacy just because she birthed them.", "Thanks for this. That was ridiculous advice.", "Really though. Mom is clearly in the wrong here, but this is not a \u201cgo no contact/cut her out of your life\u201d kind of situation, and that would be a pretty big escalation. This is more of a \u201chave a serious sit-down talk about it, and if that doesn\u2019t go well the. move out and then have her on an information diet for a while\u201d.", "Fair enough but invest in a locked box either large for everything to all go in or a small one for documentation and small stuff.", "Yeh it does get suggested a lot! I think probably LC (at least for a time) in this situation would be appropriate. I am not exactly LC with my parents in that I see them roughly weekly, but I have definitely got them on an info diet and manage our interactions so they can't try to make a power play.", "Sing it. So frustrating. Most relationships are simply \"average\": ups, downs, occasionally some sideways, and we need some assistance navigating now and then. \n\nIf we all went NC every time AITA recommended it, we'd all be some very lonely bastards.", "Oh wow, weekly! Good for you that you've managed that - it's a difficult skill. Though I have a friend whose mother has pretty significant mental health issues, and it's really reflected in how natural he is at being warm and open and somehow never saying anything about his own life.", "Sooooo true! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "No it doesn\u2019t, in any relationship familial or otherwise if one party cannot respect boundaries without physical space it\u2019s not a healthy relationship. Children have boundaries regardless of what age they are and they deserve to have them respected. If a parent cannot adapt to the changing needs of their children through the developmental process and as they grow into adults they are bad parents. You also don\u2019t have to be on equal footing for you to respect your own child. Treating them \u2018like a kid\u2019 dose not mean breaching their trust or pushing on their boundaries.", "Depends on how you see a healthy relationship with your parents, they aren't your friends or some coworker. You are never on an equal footing in here. There can be respect but they are always going to be your parents and worry and care for you because you are their kid. You don't really get that anywhere else.\n\nAnd you can set whatever boundaries you want it isn't forced on you in most cases, but when you live with your parents you are never an equal and they will treat you like their kid because that is what you have been for most of your life to them.", "If your parent doesn't see you an adult and respect a very simple boundary like \"Don't open a box that says private, and don't gossip about me to others\", at 22, she's already out of alternatives.", "Not true.   I am sorry you have parents like that.   I never pried into my children's lives and they told me a LOT of stuff.   I learned how NOT to parent from dealing with my prying mom.   I never told her anything", "You absolutely the fuck can expect to be treated like an adult when you are an adult, actually. Just because you've apparently been trained to accept that kind of intrusive and controlling behavior doesn't mean it's universal and everyone should just accept it as Just How Things Work.\n\nEither that or you're a parent who's refused to respect your kids and are trying to normalize it so you don't have to question whether you're in the right, I can't tell which it is.\n\nBut I lived with my mom for several years in my mid-20s and she never once even entered the room I was in, much less snooped in my shit or treated me like a kid. We were basically roommates. So I promise you it actually is possible for parents to respect their grown kids as adults even if they're living with them."]}
