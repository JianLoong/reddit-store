We invited some of her friends, and some family, including my brother, sister in law, and niece, Claire (6f). Claire has several allergies, gluten and dairy being the main ones. \n\nFor the party, I had pizza, chicken tenders, and sandwiches for the food. Chips, fruits and veggies for the side. Vanilla cake for dessert. For Claire, I made gluten free and vegan Mac and cheese, bought gluten free chicken tenders from the store, and she could have the fruits and veggies and chips. I got her a vegan and gluten free chocolate cupcake for dessert so she didn\u2019t feel left out. At the party, Claire was upset that she couldn\u2019t have pizza and Chick-fil-A like the rest of the kids and upset that she couldn\u2019t have the \u201cfancy cake\u201d. \n\nI tried my best to include her by getting special food and dessert for her, but my sister in law yelled at me afterwards for not just offering allergy free food and cake for the whole party so Claire didn\u2019t feel as excluded. I get why Claire was upset, she\u2019s 6, she\u2019s still a kid. But I am furious at my sister in law for yelling at me and calling me cold and selfish. My daughter doesn\u2019t have allergies. This party was for her. Most 8 year olds don\u2019t want to eat dairy free and gluten free if they don\u2019t have to. I told my sister in law that I went out of my way to try to make Claire feel included, and as her parent if she wants more, it\u2019s her responsibility to provide it for her child. I understand that it\u2019s hard to have allergies as a kid and feel excluded (I had an allergy that I outgrew eventually), but that\u2019s life and the world doesn\u2019t revolve around Claire\u2019s allergies.
