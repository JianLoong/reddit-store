Vanilla cake for dessert. For Claire, I made gluten free and vegan Mac and cheese, bought gluten free chicken tenders from the store, and she could have the fruits and veggies and chips. I got her a vegan and gluten free chocolate cupcake for dessert so she didn\u2019t feel left out. At the party, Claire was upset that she couldn\u2019t have pizza and Chick-fil-A like the rest of the kids and upset that she couldn\u2019t have the \u201cfancy cake\u201d. \n\nI tried my best to include her by getting special food and dessert for her, but my sister in law yelled at me afterwards for not just offering allergy free food and cake for the whole party so Claire didn\u2019t feel as excluded. I get why Claire was upset, she\u2019s 6, she\u2019s still a kid. But I am furious at my sister in law for yelling at me and calling me cold and selfish. My daughter doesn\u2019t have allergies. This party was for her. Most 8 year olds don\u2019t want to eat dairy free and gluten free if they don\u2019t have to.

I've definitely had celiac friends who had to be careful about cutting boards and pasta strainers and stuff that their gluten-eating roommates had used.

You did a lot, above and beyond, to accommodate your neice. It doesn't sound like her own parents did anything to help ensure their own child's party experience as it related to the dietary issues would be a pleasant one, for example bring special allergy safe food or discuss with the daughter ahead of time the possible food she might encounter that would be tempting but off limits to her. You can give yourself a lot of credit for what you did as Auntie.\n\nOn the other hand, a lot of commentors say that the solution is not inviting this family again. I disagree. Calling you cold and selfish is completely untrue because you obviously behaved in a way that was the exact opposite of that in this instance. What I suspect is that your brother and sil are having a hard time dealing with their daughter's foid allergy. Maybe instead of just cutting people off you should address the issue to them. I don't know what your relationship is like with your brother, but if you have a pretty good relationship with him, I would start there. Begin by talking about the topic of the food allergy. Ask questions about it. Get to know what it feels like for them on a day to day basis, then without bringing negative emotions into it, let him know that it was difficult to hear sil say the things to you she did that represents you yourself as being uncaring when you took time to provide special food for the occasion and oftentimes it's the parent's who provide for their own children in these scenarios. Remain resolute in getting your point across but don't let it devolve into blaming or anything negative. Gauge your brother's response. Maybe he will discuss it with his wife and bring her to reason. It's important to find some balance in extended family relationships where you feel heard and have your actions not be devalued by others. If your brother and yourself don't have a close enough relationship to have the conversation I mentioned, then you need to try having it directly with SIL. Keep in mind she may not even realize that the reason she lashed out at you like that is because she herself is struggling with this parenting challenge. Discuss the issue with her in a supportive way, but don't accept blame that isn't yours. If she doesn't budge in her position or attitude let her know that she didn't do enough to accommodate her daughter in this situation and she will encounter a lot of different situations in life where her daughter will be accommodated even less when outside of her immediate family and if she as mom doesn't step up to the plate her daughter will suffer unnecessary distress because of her own actions.", "Definitely NTA, as someone with celiac disease I find it very seldom that people fully accommodate my needs in the way you did. I usually bring my own desserts to family events and being snacks in case there is cross contact between the foods. I've bene burned a lot.

I honestly don\u2019t understand what is wrong with providing dual options - allergen free and with the allergen; everybody can choose what they want then; those who don\u2019t have to pick the allergen free, can take that option and those who actually want the allergen free food or need to, can take the other option. \n\nI honestly feel sometimes like it\u2019s going to the other end of the extreme.

We both understand the struggle and really felt out of place sometimes at parties, but we never complained. We learned that not everyone has to eat the same things as us, and no other parents were as nice as you, so our own parents would send us to parties an such with our own food, like the dominos gluten free pizza. Growing up we were able to take care of our own allergies and specified this to our friends, so there was always something for us. You went above and beyond and got your niece multiple something\u2019s. Ofc, she\u2019s 6 so you can\u2019t fault her, but considering your SIL\u2019s reaction, she may grow up like that and I sure hope she doesn\u2019t grow up thinking the world owes her.\n\nEven at my own birthdays, even though the cake was ice cream, my parents never made everyone else eat gluten free just because of me.

Don\u2019t make regular people eat gluten free.\n\nEdit: My mother also shares the same pain as your SIL, but she never blames anyone else for not accommodating me. As an Indian, not being able to eat chapaathi and naan is disheartening, but I pushed through it. Nowadays, she kinda blames my dad because he also has it and never said anything about and I got it from him. Gluten for me was genetic, and it could be for your niece. If SIL is either feeling guilty that she gave her daughter this allergy or if she thinks that niece got it from your side, she may project that onto you. I\u2019d rather it\u2019s this and not SIL being plain unreasonable, but definitely check your options to go about this issue in the future.", "You *did* accommodate your niece.

My daughter and I both have gluten allergies. At 2.5, she knows that she can't have everything her brothers can have. She knows that not everything at a birthday party is safe for her. Our best friends do the same thing you did. Get a pack of \"safe\" cupcakes and a safe food option. And we (my husband and I, obviously not the 2yo) are more than thankful that they care enough about us for that. I'd never expect someone to cater their birthday party to our needs.", "Exactly. I've been allergic to many common foods (potatoes, tomatoes, citrus, peanuts, soy, other legumes) from age 10 and getting worse as I got older, and my mom made it a point to teach me to never expect to be catered to. She had me eat at some at home beforehand and trained me early to be able to ask and identify what I could and couldn't eat (and what amounts I could tolerate in certain situations if that food only meant GI distress instead of Anaphylaxis). That info was crucial early so that I could learn how to restrain myself later on on my own when my mom wasn't around. It was also even more special when someone would prepare something special just for me even when I didn't ask for it. What you did was pretty amazing and should be the norm if you're gonna splurge on a known allergy attendee.", "I\u2019m vegan, husband is vegetarian. When we host dinner for non-veg friends we make a whole meal that accommodates us, but we don\u2019t expect that when we are guests.

I'm not saying the food is inferior, just that I personally dont think it's as delicious, so you are essentially asking to punish the birthday girl to accommodate one child.

If they know pizza is a big deal to their kid, they will bring their own diet safe pizza for the child or whatever. \n\nYou tried to accommodate your niece by providing food she could eat, which lots of parents wouldn't have bothered with.
