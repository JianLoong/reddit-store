Vanilla cake for dessert. For Claire, I made gluten free and vegan Mac and cheese, bought gluten free chicken tenders from the store, and she could have the fruits and veggies and chips. I got her a vegan and gluten free chocolate cupcake for dessert so she didn\u2019t feel left out. At the party, Claire was upset that she couldn\u2019t have pizza and Chick-fil-A like the rest of the kids and upset that she couldn\u2019t have the \u201cfancy cake\u201d. \n\nI tried my best to include her by getting special food and dessert for her, but my sister in law yelled at me afterwards for not just offering allergy free food and cake for the whole party so Claire didn\u2019t feel as excluded. I get why Claire was upset, she\u2019s 6, she\u2019s still a kid. But I am furious at my sister in law for yelling at me and calling me cold and selfish. My daughter doesn\u2019t have allergies. This party was for her. Most 8 year olds don\u2019t want to eat dairy free and gluten free if they don\u2019t have to.

I've definitely had celiac friends who had to be careful about cutting boards and pasta strainers and stuff that their gluten-eating roommates had used.

You did a lot, above and beyond, to accommodate your neice. It doesn't sound like her own parents did anything to help ensure their own child's party experience as it related to the dietary issues would be a pleasant one, for example bring special allergy safe food or discuss with the daughter ahead of time the possible food she might encounter that would be tempting but off limits to her. You can give yourself a lot of credit for what you did as Auntie.\n\nOn the other hand, a lot of commentors say that the solution is not inviting this family again. I disagree. Calling you cold and selfish is completely untrue because you obviously behaved in a way that was the exact opposite of that in this instance. What I suspect is that your brother and sil are having a hard time dealing with their daughter's foid allergy. Maybe instead of just cutting people off you should address the issue to them. I don't know what your relationship is like with your brother, but if you have a pretty good relationship with him, I would start there. Begin by talking about the topic of the food allergy. Ask questions about it. Get to know what it feels like for them on a day to day basis, then without bringing negative emotions into it, let him know that it was difficult to hear sil say the things to you she did that represents you yourself as being uncaring when you took time to provide special food for the occasion and oftentimes it's the parent's who provide for their own children in these scenarios. Remain resolute in getting your point across but don't let it devolve into blaming or anything negative. Gauge your brother's response. Maybe he will discuss it with his wife and bring her to reason. It's important to find some balance in extended family relationships where you feel heard and have your actions not be devalued by others. If your brother and yourself don't have a close enough relationship to have the conversation I mentioned, then you need to try having it directly with SIL. Keep in mind she may not even realize that the reason she lashed out at you like that is because she herself is struggling with this parenting challenge. Discuss the issue with her in a supportive way, but don't accept blame that isn't yours. If she doesn't budge in her position or attitude let her know that she didn't do enough to accommodate her daughter in this situation and she will encounter a lot of different situations in life where her daughter will be accommodated even less when outside of her immediate family and if she as mom doesn't step up to the plate her daughter will suffer unnecessary distress because of her own actions.", "Definitely NTA, as someone with celiac disease I find it very seldom that people fully accommodate my needs in the way you did. I usually bring my own desserts to family events and being snacks in case there is cross contact between the foods. I've bene burned a lot.

I honestly don\u2019t understand what is wrong with providing dual options - allergen free and with the allergen; everybody can choose what they want then; those who don\u2019t have to pick the allergen free, can take that option and those who actually want the allergen free food or need to, can take the other option. \n\nI honestly feel sometimes like it\u2019s going to the other end of the extreme.
