In the middle of covid I saw the numbers about how it hit overweight people harder than others and I started eating right. Running. And put a weight bench in the garage. I only dropped like 30 pounds but in the past two years I've gone from being afraid of having my shirt off at the pool to bring proud of myself in the mirror.\n\nSo, boom. Halloween hits. I had been hyped all month cause I had like a Roman gladiator type costume to wear out with the kids. We always all wear costumes. I get dressed and we are both getting the kids ready and she doesn't even put on her robe to be like a fortune teller. And then she grabs the keys and says everyone ready? It was like 68F out and absolutely beautiful to walk our little neighborhood. I tell her the kids and I wanted to walk as we are standing in the drive way ready to go. She kinda stamps her foot and just goes back inside.\n\nMe and the kids go out and have a blast they were all some variant of a warrior. So we looked pretty cool with our swords marching collecting candy. One of the houses had a little haunted garage and toys to play with. We stopped there for a bit and I had a few drinks to finish the night. Exchanged numbers with the family that lives there and headed home.\n\nI get back home and after the kids get to bed. My wife explodes on me saying I smell like tequila and every since I lost weight I don't do the same things I used to do(we used to eat ice cream every single Friday like big Coldstone cups now it's like once every few months). She even brought up the phone number cause it was written down and I left it on the counter since I forgot my phone when we left. It very clearly had the couple's name on it so it's not like was from some floozy. Then she complains we all could have totally drove and I told her just because she doesn't want to better herself she didn't have to make me and the kids suffer.\n\nIt was harsh but I felt like I was being attacked for no reason.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667527532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yllwkm/aita_for_leaving_my_wife_at_home_because_she/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand driving if you\u2019re taking the kids to a different neighborhood, or if it\u2019s raining - but to just go through your own neighborhood on a nice evening? No. In fact, I and my neighbors would be really annoyed if we were handing out candy and there was a solid stream of SUVs pulling up in front of our driveways, coming from no further than around the block. No one needs that kind of pointless traffic jam.", "NTA.  I'd have a conversation to see where this is coming from.  I'd also suggest a walk a few times a week around the neighborhood.  It'll be a good bonding activity and you can meet your neighbors seeing as your newbies there.", "NTA (excluding that last comment tho). Life is change. Driving around the neighborhood in 70 weather on Halloween is tragic. \n\nYou are being attacked because she is becoming insecure.", "NTA\n\nShe's feeling insecure because your confidence has gone up since starting to workout/eat better.  She wanted you to choose her by choosing to drive and thinks that it's an indicator of how life will be going forward.  You'll stop choosing her and choose the people down the street, or the next town over, or choose to move out and be with someone in better shape.  \n\nSpend some time with your wife and make her feel special - she sounds scared of losing you and the life you have.", "Driving to go trick or treating is ridiculous. The kids are going from house to house. The houses in your neighborhood aren't that far apart. Your car is worse than useless in this process. NTA.", "NTA. People seriously drive from house to house for trick or treat? That takes away all the fun from the holiday.", "NTA, yeah that's ridiculous, driving to trick or treat your own neighborhood is the height of laziness.", "NTA\n\nYou gotta walk.  Even if you eat poorly and do no other exercise, walking will at least keep you somewhat healthy.", "NTA, what a waste of gas and good weather to drive from house to house. You and your wife need to sit down and talk about feelings, because clearly some are bottled and under pressure.", "INFO: It sounds like in the past you have driven for Halloween. Is that correct?", "Overall NTA. Candy collection is about parading around in your costume. I\u2019ve never even heard of driving for candy. Like\u2026 do you just stop the car at every house?! Does anyone do that? Does everyone just get back in the car, drive one house over, then all get back out again? I\u2019m having trouble even picturing it! So NTA for trick or treating the regular way.\n\nYou may have dipped your toe into asshole territory the way you phrased some of your comments, to her, though.\n\n>just because she doesn't want to better herself she didn't have to make me and the kids suffer\n\nI get you were feeling defensive, but don\u2019t you think that was a teeeeeensy bit on the harsh side?", "Wow, NTA. I would have loved if Halloween night was 68 degrees. \n\nReally need to sit down with her and have a heart discussion. It's obvious her feelings goes beyond Halloween and more towards how things have changed in the past few years between the two of you. However, kudos to you for changing yourself for the better post-Covid.", "NTA. Walking was the way to go. But talk to your wife. You\u2019re having a renewed sense of self, feeling great in your gladiator outfit, sword and all, and there she is on a huge robe covering her body and probably not feeling herself. And then you tell her she\u2019s not \u201cbettering herself\u201d after you come home all giddy with tequila in your breath after a jolly good time with the fit fam. Yikes dude.", "Nta\nGood for you doing what you needed for your health. Unfortunately you can't make her want to be healthy. Please don't let her keep you and the kids from having fun or anything. Sometimes people have a hard time doing things when the person they are with doesn't want to.", "NTA. What was your wife's feelings when you started to 'better yourself'. Did you discuss your goals with her and if she wanted to do it together?\n\nIt's not right for her to blow up on you like that cuz it really was not justified. It was a difference in what you+kids wanted to do and what she wanted to do.\n\nShe probably feels left behind & is coping with how you've changed and that's fair. But she can't take it out on you. She has to discuss her feelings calmly and not take it out on you cuz you did nothing wrong.\n\nYeah, you were harsh & responding to her verbal attack.. but it is what it is. The car would've been a non-fun choice. Can she walk fine without knee pains or something? It's understandable if she's in pain & chose the car for that choice.. but if it's cuz she just doesn't want to walk.. she could've drove alongside you guys??? Either way you'd have to keep stopping and getting out so it would make no difference to her.\n\nShe chose to stay behind. What was the alternative? Don't take the kids out after they got ready & were excited? Also walking is good for the kids too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's so sad when your wife is sad. Like no words can replace how sad that part makes me. She's alone because the routine that made her happy in the past has changed. On the other hand, your kids are so happy when you are with them. So so happy. Is their happiness more important than making wifey less sad? Or is making wife happy more important than taking children out to have the time of their lives? Either way, the whole situation is sad and the more I think about it, the more I don't want to think about it", "NTA It wad probably more fun for the kids to walk the neighborhood. You exchanged numbers with a couple who have kids that your kids played with. And since you weren't driving, who cares if you had a couple drinks?", "NTA. Your wife is struggling and she took it out on you but that doesn't make it your fault. If she doesn't have a disability that makes joining you on the walk impossible then there is no reason you should have to accommodate her when she refuses to join the family.", "info when are you getting a divorce?", "ESH\n\nEither one of you could have stepped up and actually communicated whether you were going to walk or drive (or both) to trick or treat.\n\nYou went out and left your phone, so she couldn\u2019t even contact you and ask where you were or if you wanted her to drive out and join you.  You couldn\u2019t tell her \u201chey we\u2019re hanging out with x neighbors and having a drink.\u201d  You completely cut her off from Halloween with you and your guys\u2019 kids.  Not cool.\n\nSounds like this has been brewing for a while with both of you.  Her comments about the two of you not doing things together anymore, your comments about how \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want to better herself\u201d.  You say you still think she\u2019s absolutely gorgeous, but you seem to resent her for not losing weight and getting in shape too.  You and the kids didn\u2019t have to \u201csuffer\u201d in any way - you chose to leave her behind.", "INFO - Did you two discuss how this halloween was gonna go before hand and what was that like?", "No one else thinks it\u2019s super weird that this guy stops and has drinks with strangers when he\u2019s taking his kids trick or treating?", "ESH. Your wife sucks for wanting to drive to trick or treat. That's absurd, and telling that she isn't taking care of herself. However, you definitely should be doing more things to bond with her and be together- it doesn't have to be ice cream- but she's your wife and you should make her feel appreciated. The two of you should have a long talk about how both of you are feeling and see if you can come to some kind of agreement where the two of you have more quality time and she also works on herself.", "nta, i side with you on this buddy", "NTA. Comments are also wild - insecure woman gets sympathy. If it was a guy throwing this kind of tantrum out of insecurity he'd be flamed and rightly so.", "Edit: I read this whole thing wrong gonna sit out now", "YTA. I struggled with this one, but what you said to your wife was unnecessarily personal and mean. It sounds like you know she\u2019s sensitive or insecure about your new physical fitness, and you hit her where it hurts.", "ESH kinda  \nShe's feeling left out. Y'all just need more open communication. Ask her to come workout with you. Treat her to a spa day. Get her some flowers or whatever she likes and assure her she is still loved even though you started working out. We get pretty insecure sometimes as women...at least I do.   \nmaybe get some marriage counseling. Go on a holiday together.    \nI get why she wanted to drive around. She's probably insecure with how she looks. Or maybe she was tired. She shouldn't have blown up but you shouldn't have said she doesn't want to better herself. She probably does but doesn't know how or doesn't even have the confidence to try because she will fail.", "NTA", "NTA. People that do drive-thru trick or treating (barring disabilities or like rural areas or something of course) are assholes and ruin the spirit of the holiday. Sounds like OP and his kids had an awesome time while his wife just sat at home being purposefully miserable and is now jealous that he made some new friends without her.", "Exactly. The people who drive instead of walk through neighborhoods to trick or treat are massive AHs. Granted someone doesn't have a disability that impairs their mobility, driving down streets filled with small children is dangerous and selfish. It became a big issue in my neighborhood a few years back. I stopped giving out candy and made myself scarce on Halloween night in big part because adults were sucking the joy out of it....\n\nOP and his wife seem to have other issues, but for this one she is very wrong.", "She wanted OP to sacrifice his and their children's happiness to cater to her insecurities.", "All of this. Couples theray would be a great idea too, as I doubt she is even aware of this, or at least the extent to which her insecurities could cause a selffulfilling prophecy if she cannot reign them in.", "I drove for the first this Halloween. Sat in the car with a mask because I was sick(just a cold no covid) but I was not up for walking around. It happens.", "Usually when someone \u201cdrives\u201d on Halloween, they\u2019ll only drive from block to block or the parent will stay in the car and drive along side as the kid goes door to door.  It\u2019s a super common for parents who are disabled or even just sick / exhausted / overworked to be able to keep an eye on their kids, while still letting their kids enjoy Halloween.", "When I was a kid, we lived way outside the neighborhood. We drove *to* there, parked on the side of the street, and then walked around\n\nYou *gotta* walk for trick-or-treating, half the fun is seeing your classmates and complementing their costumes!", "We had always done trunk or treats with the church or the kids school. There were two years we drove to a nearby neighborhood and hit houses then hop back in and find more houses that's back when we lived in apartments so it was our only option.\n\nWe bought our house in December 2021 so this is our first Halloween in an actual neighborhood.", "Thanks, I wanted to ask this as well.", "The wife is complaining that he isn't still doing the things he did when he was at an unhealthy weight. So she's sabotaging his progress.\n\nEating healthier food and working out is in fact bettering yourself.\n\nShe doesn't want to do that and she wants to use the family car like a mobility scooter - which is a lame ass way to trick or treat.\n\nNothing he said was overly harsh except in the harsh truth way.\n\nShe wants them to cater to her unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nNTA.", "I considered doing that this year because I wasn't feeling well...but I also didn't want the cops to get called on me or a gun get pulled thinking I'm stalking kids. Boggles my mind that this is really a thing.", "Usually when someone \u201cdrives\u201d on Halloween, they\u2019ll only drive from block to block or the parent will stay in the car and drive along side as the kid goes door to door.

But that comment is a bit harsh and probably quite hurtful for your wife. It did not really sound like walking was about \u00ab\u00a0bettering yourself\u00a0\u00bb, but rather that it was more enjoyable - then it is not necessary with digs like that:) obviously understand that can happen in the heat of the moment though", "This made my night", "TBF, I wouldn't even think to drive down streets filled with small children during trick or treat time. That just seems selfish and dangerous.\n\nAlso, I get that OP forgot his phone, but she was free to go with them. She didnt want to. She also could have went looking for them. They were in walking distance and I doubt they were moving super fast since they were going door to door.", "She went inside as they were walking away. She made it clear that she wasn't going if she had to walk. It sounds more like she is not liking the changes even though they are positive for him and is working from her own insecurities.", "He didn't cut her off from the kids or Halloween. She chose to stay home. She could have walked and caught up with them if she wanted to.", "In some neighborhoods it\u2019s common to hand out treats for the kids and have drinks or treats for the adults too. Especially if you live somewhere with nicer fall weather where people hang out outside. One of my neighbors had a fire pit last year and was grilling hotdogs on Halloween.", "This is normal for a lot of neighborhoods! We ended our night with warm mulled wine and pumpkin moonshine at a little party on my street. They also had food and cookies and music. A lot of times the parents will hang out there while the older kids trick or treat the street, and everyone who's there brings the candy from their house to hand out at a big table in the driveway.", "We open our garage doors and every couple of houses there's food and drinks, music, a scary movie, etc.\n\nNot weird at all.", "I'm curious why you think his harsh response is not fine while her response is? She makes it clear she doesn't like the way he's making more health conscious choices. In my eyes he made the choice to walk more for the kids than himself. You don't take your wife trick or treating you take the kids. If his wife didn't want to give the kids what they wanted or the best experience possible she really didn't need to go.", "Agreed. Cruel for no reason and he isolated her even though they always drove in the past.", "There is always a spike of children getting killed by cars on Halloween.", "That\u2019s what we used to do too. I always went trick or treating with my cousins and our neighborhoods sucked for trick or treating so we\u2019d go to our grandparents or our aunt\u2019s or my one Uncle\u2019s parents neighborhood and trick or treat there. We did walk once we got there though.", "So did you at any point discuss walking with your wife, since it's a change from what you've always done in the past?\n\nFrom what I can see, ESH.\n\nYou unilaterally decided how trick-or-treating was gonna go and didn't say anything to her till you were on the driveway about to leave? You must be aware of how far she is or isn't happy to walk in general, but you didn't think this needed a mention before that moment?\n\nY'all should have talked about it before she stomped off inside and you just left. But you both were happy to cut her out of Halloween because you decided to walk. \n\nHonestly, congrats on being happy with your lifestyle change. But you sound like someone who decides they're *so* much better than their partner because you made a lifestyle change earlier than they did, even though *you were exactly the same as them before*. And you've decided that she should change on your timeline. Despite the fact that you also didn't change for like ten years before that. It's just kinda hypocritical.\n\nShe shouldn't get mad at you  for having new healthy habits. You shouldn't jab at her about 'if you don't want to better yourself' because it malicious and judgemental, especially if you had not talked to her about this before.  It seems like you're kinda self-satisfied and righteous with making a punishment out of her not wanting to walk, which is kinda bullsh\\*t when you've never done that before. \n\nAnd the two of you together should have talked about how to do Halloween before it came to that sudden disagreement.", "On top of that, driving any small distance in fine weather is AH-behavior. Seriously, hasn't Greta Thunberg taught people anything?", "First off happy cake day friend. Secondly after reading your comment I was co fused af so I went back and read the post again. Somehow I read the whole thing wrong the first time and you are totally right. Not sure how but I missed a solid couple sentences or maybe my brain didn't register them."]}
