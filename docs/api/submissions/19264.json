He went alone and I asked him to just follow the same order I had sent him yesterday via Snapchat. I fell asleep and woke up later and went to go eat my sandwich. I noticed it wasn\u2019t fully what I ordered so I asked him if it was his or mine. He confirmed it was mine so I started to eat it. I was confused because some things were missing and other things added. I noticed spinach inside and asked him about it. He said he added spinach instead of lettuce because it\u2019s a superfood and therefore healthier. He knows I like spinach so he said that he didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.

The next time you're under the weather and just really want a nice cold drink to soothe your sore throat, don't be surprised if he or she tosses you an emergen-c packet and a bottle of room temperature water bc that would be wayyyy healthier for you.

I sincerely hope that anyone who gets food for you in the future fucks with your order. And there will always be a good reason, I'm sure. Oh you wanted fries?

This isn\u2019t what I ordered though, what happened?\n\nOh, I though spinach would be healthier since it\u2019s a superfood.\n\nActually I was really looking forward to crisp lettuce on this sandwich. Could you ask next time before changing my order?\n\nSure no problem.", "I believe that spinach actually does have a fairly high iron content, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s inaccessible to humans due to the way we digest plant foods", "Don't listen to an idiot who clearly has the emotional intelligence of a peanut. Just because someone does something for you does not mean you need to be grateful, especially when it was done incorrectly for no damn reason. \"Oh, you cleaned my room! (and also moved every single item I ever told you not to touch)\" \"You cooked me dinner! (And used ingredients I've stated multiple times I hate)\" \"You bought me jewelry! (And ignored the hundreds of conversations about what kind of styles I like)\" The quality of gestures means something OP. \n\nI'm not going to tell you to divorce him because that's insane to do off of one slice of life on Reddit. But think about the actual effort put into your individual gestures for one another. You got married really young, don't let a lack of life experience or early attachment blind you to the realities of your relationship because you have decades to go. I hope this was just a bad day/misunderstanding, but if its not and this kind of behavior is a pattern, consider if this is really the kind of effort you'll want at 30, 40, 50, if you have kids etc. Good luck."]}
