So she came back home accompanied by her father and Kim. She has apologised for her actions and said there was nothing wrong with the food I made, it just she preferred Kim's cooking at the time, but after living with them for a bit she realised it was not that special.\n\nWe sat down and Kim gave her perspective: as she runs a local restaurant when Erin was staying over originally Kim would make restaurant quality dishes that she would serve to the clients and a lot of times they use more and stronger spices or different more expensive ingredients depending on the dish and sometimes msg to enhance flavour of sauces. When Erin moved in with them and not just coming to see them over the weekend, Kim switched to making similar dishes but in more domestic style, so probably that's why Erin didn't like mine and \"homemade\" Kim's meals as they had less spices or sauces. She also explained it to Erin.\n\nErin seemed to be very excited, so I have asked her if anything happened. She said that Kim allowed her to learn some cooking at her restaurant when it is not too busy and she asked if I'm okay with this. I was relieved and told her I would be happy for her to learn but also warned her that she might get to stressed with all those after school activities and if she wants she can drop some that she doesn't enjoy. I have also suggested her to cook for us a dish she learned (me, my bf, my ex husband, Kim and herself) maybe once a month to see how close it would be to restaurant level.\n\nWe have also agreed to have some cooking days where me and Kim share and exchange our \"secrets\" and \"techniques\" when cooking and Erin is free to join in.", "created_utc": 1667992426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqfw71/update_aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_can_cook/", "score": 1801, "replies": ["Yes! What a wonderful outcome that is going to help with coparenting and help your daughter learn and grow!", "Sounds like the best possible outcome. Knowing how to cook well is a very valuable skill, not to mention a good hobby", "Oh wow! This is awesome. So happy for you all.", "What a positive, mature way to handle this situation. Look, people can actually \"adult\" here!", "Did Mike apologise for the a\\*\\*hole and \"starving your daughter\" comments? Other than that, it sounds like a good outcome :)", "This is just so dang wholesome and supportive and loving. Thanks for filling us in!", "That makes sense. When you're a kid, restaurant quality tastes sooooo much better and the emotions just come with being a kid and navigating life. We've all been little lovable brats. Glad this story has such an amazing outcome!", "Thank you for this wonderful update! Sounds like a great solution and top coparenting.", "Yay!! Once again communication for the win!  What a wonderful update.", "this is the sweetest outcome, amazing coparenting from all sides :)", "Parents, a stepparent, and a teenager all acting reasonably with kindness and understanding.   Wow. That has to break some kind of AITA rule.   Lol.   I glad things had a happy ending.", "That\u2019s some great co-parenting!", "A fantastic outcome, well done all around!", "Am I really still in AITA? We have a healthy conversation, amicable coparenting, parents concerned about stressed kids and saying they have a choice in dropping after school activities, and sharing recipes and techniques.", "Great job and I hope the three is you have many happy cooking days ahead!", "What a happy resolution! I wonder how Erin will feel when she learns that restaurant food usually tastes better because it just contains more salt and fat than the usual homemade fare.", "asking the important questions!", "Indeed, that is important information. Because it sounds like you and Kim are doing a good job co-parenting, but is mike?", "Top comment in the original post: \"I have a feeling this is not about the food.\"\n\nUpdate: It was about the food.", "Kim sounds like an A+ step parent\n\nShe saw what was happening, took the time to talk to the kid, and helped her see how mean she was being to her mom\n\nThat's a solid person right there", "Lovely update. The kind that restores faith to humanity.", "Alhamdulillah how beautiful! Glad things worked out OP! Thanks for the update!", "Such a happy outcome! \ud83d\ude0a", "Nice, looks like your daughter has found her passion.

I\u2019m so glad you were able to come to a compromise that works for everyone!", "Top parent award \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude00 \ud83d\ude04", "What a positive update !!", "Thank you for the update, most of the time these problems can be solved with vulnerable communication. I'm happy that your daughter opened up to the conversation and that y'all are so committed to good coparenting. Love to see this :)", "I remember your post and like I said, once you guys sat down and talked, everything will be fine. And it looks like it went better than I even expected so I am glad everything worked out and your daughter apologized. this is a really good update", "What a perfect ending!!", "Fantastic!! So glad to hear such a positive update. You seem to have a great family dynamic. Glad to see you all together for the sake of your daughter. You guys are awesome.", "You are a great mom!", "perfect solution!", "This is co-parenting gold!! Kudos to all the adults truly prioritizing the child\u2019s mental and physical well being. I hope your maturity is contagious.  Every kid deserves this kind of support!!!", "Positive coparenting and communication for the win! You guys are awesome!", "I'm bummed, I was hoping it was an update from Accidental Meatloaf.", "He did, Erin has also said she might have exaggerated a bit when speaking to Mike and Mike kinda forgot that Erin also knows how to cook... He also got me a small present to say sorry.", "Lol. Do I want to know what 'Accidental Meatloaf' is?\n\nI am familiar with 'Schrodingers meatballs' and 'The lasagna of convenience', but thats a new one on me.", "You know what, at least he went a little out of his way haha. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve managed to sort this out and everyone\u2019s getting on okay!\n\nI know you didn\u2019t ask but a good level of co-operation and teamwork between separated parents is incredible and really really helps the kids so you\u2019re doing amazing there.", "A post maybe yesterday or the day before.\n\nThe OP's daughter didn't like meatloaf and was visiting for 1 week.\n\nIn that 1 week, the OP made meatloaf two times, claiming it to be an accident.", "Ah I remember seeing that from yesterday. Didnt read it though. Might have a look for it now!", "I\u2019m still super interested i how something so unbelievably minor escalated into her actually moving all the way out of her home. How did she draw the line from \u201cthis food is nice\u201d to \u201cI hate your food and I\u2019m moving out and burning it all down\u201d? Like\u2026wtf?", "I love this update!", "That's such a great resolution! I'm glad for your whole family!", "As my mom would say every time we come to her raving about someone\u2019s food: \u201ckids always prefer other people\u2019s food than their parents\u201d. I think because it is a new dish, so we get excited about it rather than the food we are used to eating all the time.", "It is so very nice to hear when separated families come together to happily raise the child/children as a whole unit. I love the dynamic you all share!", "What a lovely wholesome outcome  \nI wish you guys all the best", "This is such a wholesome update. It\u2019s so nice to hear when exes can coparent so well.", "This is one of those updates that makes the start of my day just a little better and slightly restores my faith in humanity", "I love everything about this update. Keep being an awesome parent!", "I\u2019m so happy everyone dealt with this in mature way. A+ for everyone", "Awesome, glad your ex and his wife were also active in helping her come around and encouraging her cooking skills.", "I love this outcome! It's so much better when people sit down and communicate rather than just going NC.", "My first reaction when reading the post was YAY! This is how it's supposed to be! Kim and OP sharing recipes and secrets, Kim letting Erin come to the restaurant to learn, and them having a monthly dinner to test what she learned!", "It is like an episode from the twilight zone xD", "And everyone here is acting like that's normal teen behavior. Like \"oh that loveable little scamp flipping out and moving out of the house again!\" That is not normal.", "I thought the same thing from reading the title lol", "That\u2019s some great co-parenting!", "Yay!! Once again communication for the win!
