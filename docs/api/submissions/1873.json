So she came back home accompanied by her father and Kim. She has apologised for her actions and said there was nothing wrong with the food I made, it just she preferred Kim's cooking at the time, but after living with them for a bit she realised it was not that special.\n\nWe sat down and Kim gave her perspective: as she runs a local restaurant when Erin was staying over originally Kim would make restaurant quality dishes that she would serve to the clients and a lot of times they use more and stronger spices or different more expensive ingredients depending on the dish and sometimes msg to enhance flavour of sauces. When Erin moved in with them and not just coming to see them over the weekend, Kim switched to making similar dishes but in more domestic style, so probably that's why Erin didn't like mine and \"homemade\" Kim's meals as they had less spices or sauces. She also explained it to Erin.\n\nErin seemed to be very excited, so I have asked her if anything happened. She said that Kim allowed her to learn some cooking at her restaurant when it is not too busy and she asked if I'm okay with this. I was relieved and told her I would be happy for her to learn but also warned her that she might get to stressed with all those after school activities and if she wants she can drop some that she doesn't enjoy. I have also suggested her to cook for us a dish she learned (me, my bf, my ex husband, Kim and herself) maybe once a month to see how close it would be to restaurant level.\n\nWe have also agreed to have some cooking days where me and Kim share and exchange our \"secrets\" and \"techniques\" when cooking and Erin is free to join in.", "created_utc": 1667992426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqfw71/update_aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_can_cook/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Yes! What a wonderful outcome that is going to help with coparenting and help your daughter learn and grow!", "Sounds like the best possible outcome. Knowing how to cook well is a very valuable skill, not to mention a good hobby", "Oh wow! This is awesome. So happy for you all.", "What a positive, mature way to handle this situation. Look, people can actually \"adult\" here!", "Did Mike apologise for the a\\*\\*hole and \"starving your daughter\" comments? Other than that, it sounds like a good outcome :)", "This is just so dang wholesome and supportive and loving. Thanks for filling us in!", "That makes sense. When you're a kid, restaurant quality tastes sooooo much better and the emotions just come with being a kid and navigating life. We've all been little lovable brats. Glad this story has such an amazing outcome!", "Thank you for this wonderful update! Sounds like a great solution and top coparenting.", "Yay!! Once again communication for the win!  What a wonderful update.", "this is the sweetest outcome, amazing coparenting from all sides :)", "Parents, a stepparent, and a teenager all acting reasonably with kindness and understanding.   Wow. That has to break some kind of AITA rule.   Lol.   I glad things had a happy ending.", "That\u2019s some great co-parenting!", "A fantastic outcome, well done all around!", "Am I really still in AITA? We have a healthy conversation, amicable coparenting, parents concerned about stressed kids and saying they have a choice in dropping after school activities, and sharing recipes and techniques.", "Great job and I hope the three is you have many happy cooking days ahead!", "What a happy resolution! I wonder how Erin will feel when she learns that restaurant food usually tastes better because it just contains more salt and fat than the usual homemade fare.", "asking the important questions!", "Indeed, that is important information. Because it sounds like you and Kim are doing a good job co-parenting, but is mike?"]}
