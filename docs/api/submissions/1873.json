{"id": 1873, "submission_id": "yqfw71", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for telling my daughter she can cook herself now if she doesn't like my cooking?", "selftext": "Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yd53e2/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_can_cook_herself/\n\nI just wanted to post an update and a somewhat closure.\n\nThe past few weeks have been hard and I think Erin has seen my post. So she came back home accompanied by her father and Kim. She has apologised for her actions and said there was nothing wrong with the food I made, it just she preferred Kim's cooking at the time, but after living with them for a bit she realised it was not that special.\n\nWe sat down and Kim gave her perspective: as she runs a local restaurant when Erin was staying over originally Kim would make restaurant quality dishes that she would serve to the clients and a lot of times they use more and stronger spices or different more expensive ingredients depending on the dish and sometimes msg to enhance flavour of sauces. When Erin moved in with them and not just coming to see them over the weekend, Kim switched to making similar dishes but in more domestic style, so probably that's why Erin didn't like mine and \"homemade\" Kim's meals as they had less spices or sauces. She also explained it to Erin.\n\nErin seemed to be very excited, so I have asked her if anything happened. She said that Kim allowed her to learn some cooking at her restaurant when it is not too busy and she asked if I'm okay with this. I was relieved and told her I would be happy for her to learn but also warned her that she might get to stressed with all those after school activities and if she wants she can drop some that she doesn't enjoy. I have also suggested her to cook for us a dish she learned (me, my bf, my ex husband, Kim and herself) maybe once a month to see how close it would be to restaurant level.\n\nWe have also agreed to have some cooking days where me and Kim share and exchange our \"secrets\" and \"techniques\" when cooking and Erin is free to join in.", "created_utc": 1667992426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqfw71/update_aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_can_cook/", "score": 2699, "replies": ["Yes!

I glad things had a happy ending.", "That\u2019s some great co-parenting!", "A fantastic outcome, well done all around!", "Am I really still in AITA? We have a healthy conversation, amicable coparenting, parents concerned about stressed kids and saying they have a choice in dropping after school activities, and sharing recipes and techniques.", "Great job and I hope the three is you have many happy cooking days ahead!", "What a happy resolution! I wonder how Erin will feel when she learns that restaurant food usually tastes better because it just contains more salt and fat than the usual homemade fare.", "asking the important questions!", "Indeed, that is important information. Because it sounds like you and Kim are doing a good job co-parenting, but is mike?", "Top comment in the original post: \"I have a feeling this is not about the food.\"\n\nUpdate: It was about the food.", "Kim sounds like an A+ step parent\n\nShe saw what was happening, took the time to talk to the kid, and helped her see how mean she was being to her mom\n\nThat's a solid person right there", "Lovely update. The kind that restores faith to humanity.", "Alhamdulillah how beautiful! Glad things worked out OP! Thanks for the update!", "Such a happy outcome! \ud83d\ude0a", "Nice, looks like your daughter has found her passion.

I'm happy that your daughter opened up to the conversation and that y'all are so committed to good coparenting. Love to see this :)", "I remember your post and like I said, once you guys sat down and talked, everything will be fine. And it looks like it went better than I even expected so I am glad everything worked out and your daughter apologized. this is a really good update", "What a perfect ending!!", "Fantastic!!

You guys are awesome.", "You are a great mom!", "perfect solution!", "This is co-parenting gold!! Kudos to all the adults truly prioritizing the child\u2019s mental and physical well being. I hope your maturity is contagious.  Every kid deserves this kind of support!!!", "Positive coparenting and communication for the win! You guys are awesome!", "I'm bummed, I was hoping it was an update from Accidental Meatloaf.", "He did, Erin has also said she might have exaggerated a bit when speaking to Mike and Mike kinda forgot that Erin also knows how to cook... He also got me a small present to say sorry.", "Lol. Do I want to know what 'Accidental Meatloaf' is?\n\nI am familiar with 'Schrodingers meatballs' and 'The lasagna of convenience', but thats a new one on me.", "You know what, at least he went a little out of his way haha. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve managed to sort this out and everyone\u2019s getting on okay!\n\nI know you didn\u2019t ask but a good level of co-operation and teamwork between separated parents is incredible and really really helps the kids so you\u2019re doing amazing there.", "A post maybe yesterday or the day before.\n\nThe OP's daughter didn't like meatloaf and was visiting for 1 week.\n\nIn that 1 week, the OP made meatloaf two times, claiming it to be an accident.", "Ah I remember seeing that from yesterday. Didnt read it though. Might have a look for it now!", "I\u2019m still super interested i how something so unbelievably minor escalated into her actually moving all the way out of her home.

Like\u2026wtf?", "I love this update!", "That's such a great resolution! I'm glad for your whole family!", "As my mom would say every time we come to her raving about someone\u2019s food: \u201ckids always prefer other people\u2019s food than their parents\u201d. I think because it is a new dish, so we get excited about it rather than the food we are used to eating all the time.", "It is so very nice to hear when separated families come together to happily raise the child/children as a whole unit. I love the dynamic you all share!", "What a lovely wholesome outcome  \nI wish you guys all the best", "This is such a wholesome update. It\u2019s so nice to hear when exes can coparent so well.", "This is one of those updates that makes the start of my day just a little better and slightly restores my faith in humanity", "I love everything about this update. Keep being an awesome parent!", "I\u2019m so happy everyone dealt with this in mature way. A+ for everyone", "Awesome, glad your ex and his wife were also active in helping her come around and encouraging her cooking skills.", "I love this outcome! It's so much better when people sit down and communicate rather than just going NC.", "My first reaction when reading the post was YAY! This is how it's supposed to be! Kim and OP sharing recipes and secrets, Kim letting Erin come to the restaurant to learn, and them having a monthly dinner to test what she learned!", "It is like an episode from the twilight zone xD", "And everyone here is acting like that's normal teen behavior. Like \"oh that loveable little scamp flipping out and moving out of the house again!\" That is not normal.", "I thought the same thing from reading the title lol", "That\u2019s some great co-parenting!", "Yay!!

Great update \u263a\ufe0f", "Thanks so much for the update; it\u2019s so nice to hear how this situation turned out.\n\nIt sounds like everyone in this situation was able to approach it and work it out like adults, which is great and a fabulous lesson for Erin.\n\nKim sounds like a great step-parent, and I\u2019m happy Erin is able to bond with her without it genuinely coming in between you and her (save for the road bump of misunderstandings that arose around Kim\u2018s cooking and Erin\u2019s behavior). As if Erin has been granted a bonus parent (or maybe two; depends on the dynamic with your boyfriend) to love and care for her alongside the two she already has.  \n\nI think you handled the initial situation really well, and I think the fallout of it was handled very well, too.", "Love this!!

Also amazing co-parenting skills as well. I'm happy this is working itself out so well!", "How did she draw the line from \u201cthis food is nice\u201d to \u201cI hate your food and I\u2019m moving out!", "Nice, looks like your daughter has found her passion. And how awesome is it that both mom", "Not to mention someone apologizing and trying getting a gift to make up for their words", "Another important fact that I didn't see here, is that 99% of the time restaurant food is a lot less healthy than homecooked food.  A lot of those good flavors come from heaps of butter or other fats and a single plate often has more sodium than you should be eating over 2-3 days...", "Cool, is that an Islamic expression?  What does it mean?", "Teenage girls are dramatic.\n\nSource: I was once a teenage girl.", "Me too, but she didn\u2019t respond much to the comments so I suspect she\u2019s taken her ball home and is blaming the Reddit audience for being teenagers/ crazy/ not understanding her younger kids need all her attention.", "This is all such a wonderful outcome, I'm really glad for all of you.
