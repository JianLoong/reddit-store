So she came back home accompanied by her father and Kim. She has apologised for her actions and said there was nothing wrong with the food I made, it just she preferred Kim's cooking at the time, but after living with them for a bit she realised it was not that special.\n\nWe sat down and Kim gave her perspective: as she runs a local restaurant when Erin was staying over originally Kim would make restaurant quality dishes that she would serve to the clients and a lot of times they use more and stronger spices or different more expensive ingredients depending on the dish and sometimes msg to enhance flavour of sauces. When Erin moved in with them and not just coming to see them over the weekend, Kim switched to making similar dishes but in more domestic style, so probably that's why Erin didn't like mine and \"homemade\" Kim's meals as they had less spices or sauces. She also explained it to Erin.\n\nErin seemed to be very excited, so I have asked her if anything happened. She said that Kim allowed her to learn some cooking at her restaurant when it is not too busy and she asked if I'm okay with this. I was relieved and told her I would be happy for her to learn but also warned her that she might get to stressed with all those after school activities and if she wants she can drop some that she doesn't enjoy. I have also suggested her to cook for us a dish she learned (me, my bf, my ex husband, Kim and herself) maybe once a month to see how close it would be to restaurant level.\n\nWe have also agreed to have some cooking days where me and Kim share and exchange our \"secrets\" and \"techniques\" when cooking and Erin is free to join in.", "created_utc": 1667992426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqfw71/update_aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_can_cook/", "score": 5860, "replies": ["Yes!
