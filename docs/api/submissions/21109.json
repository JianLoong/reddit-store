We were all in a group chat, including their mother, we\u2019ll call her Dawn, & another sister. Jane was a cop & every crime scene she went to, she was taking pictures & sending them in the group chat. I NEVER said anything about it or how morally wrong that was until one of my best friends from high school, we\u2019ll call her Grace, messaged me about her uncle who had been missing for over a month & how they finally found his body.. well Jane had just sent pictures of a weapon & a crime scene. That\u2019s when it clicked that it was Graces Uncle. Amy, Jane, & dawn were all discussing whether or not this man took his life or someone else did\u2026 absolutely disgusting & made me sick to my stomach. They were making bets on how this man\u2019s life ended while his family is broken & hurt. The cops weren\u2019t really telling his family much due to it being an open investigation & I really felt like taking pictures of an investigation to that extent was highly wrong (she never took any as bad as this) & forwarded the image to Grace, not the messages, just the image. Well Grace sent that to her granny, mind you her granny thought I was someone completely different & was calling me by a whole different name. So when she reported it, my name wasn\u2019t involved. They launched an internal investigation & I had to make a statement on record that was confidential and send all screenshots I had to the detective. Well she ended up getting fired & when she did they all messaged me basically sticking up for her & told me I was banned from the family. They never said why or for what but obviously I already knew. To make it even more clear, I never had a close relationship with Jane BUT I would never just make someone lose their job. She used being an officer as a weapon & would make open threats like if she sees this person that she doesn\u2019t like she\u2019s going to arrest them.. she was spilling all the details of that crime to whoever else & it was getting passed on to everyone to the point that people were talking about it in town when those details should have never been known. Their mothers own friends blocked them & messaged the victims wife because they were talking so much about the case. I honestly felt really bad but she didn\u2019t have good intentions. If she did, she would have never sent half the things she did. And to be clear, I would have never been able to say anything directly about it or they would have all jumped on me for ever saying that. I blocked all of them & haven\u2019t heard from them since. \nSo AITA for getting a cop fired?", "created_utc": 1688254695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o97oh/aita_for_getting_a_cop_fired/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did a public service.", "NTA - what she did was unprofessional, grossly insensitive, and illegal. She deserved to lose her job.", "NTA.\n\nPolice Officers in theory should be held to a high ethical standard. If they\u2019re flagrantly breaking protocols, procedures, or the law, especially in a way that leaks confidential information that could harm an investigation, they should have never been employed in the first place. \n\nAs it is, the police could be facing a massive lawsuit from the family of the victim over this, so sounds like the ex cop and her family are just mad at facing consequences.", "NTA, at all.  What she was doing was morally repugnant and possibly illegal. She was talking about things that the family of the victims weren't even told about.

It\u2019s insane that you didn\u2019t report her way before this. She constantly posted pictures of crime scenes and discussed open cases and you didn\u2019t think that was worth reporting? You say it made you sick and was (obviously) morally wrong but you didn\u2019t say anything and stayed in the group chat? Come on now.", "NTA. This is disgusting behavior by every single person who shared the pictures but especially her. I wish she would be charged. If this happened in America she probably never will be.", "NTA.

Also, she never posted anything, it was sent in a private group chat with her sisters & mom - not that it makes it any better. These were the first graphic photos she sent of an actual crime scene, most were discussed or photos didn\u2019t show graphic images which is still 100% wrong and I truly wish I could have said something sooner than I did but thankfully she was not an officer for long..", "NTA.

Thanks to \"qualified immunity\" (which really isn't qualified at all) they are immune from almost all the consequences of their actions. \n\nJane is probably upset because somehow she was held responsible when no one else is. Either she was on thin ice to begin with, or this is sexism, but while one less corrupt cop is a drop in the ocean, it's still a step in the right direction.", "Esh also because why would you forward the pics to Grace?!
