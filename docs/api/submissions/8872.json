She insisted that she already knows where she wants to stay but I told her to get in the car and drove her there.\n\nAfter a week I called and asked if she wants to come home and she said yes however she hasn't been talking to me.

She\u2019s a teenager. She has lost so very much in her short life. You mention providing for her well with your income but financial safety isn\u2019t all a child needs especially one with loss trauma. She copped to her dramatics and you still sent her to live with a virtual stranger for a week where she didn\u2019t feel safe or comfortable and now she is likely scared of you. Congratulations for further traumatizing her. She needs therapy for her losses and your nonsense and you need some therapy to help yourself understand how to parent a traumatized child.", "YTA. Actually sending her away? Dude.", "YTA.  She's thirteen and an orphan.  She told you she didn't mean it.  You know she didn't mean it.  You're supposed to be an adult.  You taught her a serious lesson, that you don't have her back, that you are willing to abandon her at the first hint of conflict and when she reads this, that you think she is a spoiled, gold digger when is only with you for the money.  Plan on a frosty relationship until she is gone and then she will be gone.", "YTA - a huge one. You are this child\u2019s parent and you took a child\u2019s empty threat and used it against potentially causing emotional damage and trauma.", "I don't think either of you are TA but only IF:\n\nOtherwise, you will be TA.\n\nAt 13, a young lady needs to understand that words have consequences. This IS NOT going to get any better, though. She's a raging bag of hormones right now, and she does need a constructive way to express her emotions. \n\nYou failed to teach her a better way of expressing herself. At the same time, she has learned there are boundaries. You are now her father figure and sending her away like that tells HER that your love is conditional. \n\nIF you capitalize on this situation and go to her, apologize for sending her away, and then use that moment to let her know she is dearly loved but that you have limits just as she does, it could open the door to a level of communication you both benefit from. \n\nLike it or not, YOU are her teacher. Even when she doesn't appear to be listening and learning, she is! This young lady, if you're smart enough to understand, is also YOUR teacher. You can open up a whole new way of having conversations with everyone in your life if you can learn how to have one in your own home with those you love.", "Nta, you are one of the few who followed through with your threat.\n\nBut dont think you are a better guardian because you make \"good money\" a spoiled child eventually grows into a bigger brat", "Your 13 year old niece, who you adopted because both her parents died, lashed out because she was upset and you followed through on sending her to a complete stranger, and you're wondering if you're the asshole? \n\nYikes, YTA.", "YTA. She\u2019s 13 - she\u2019s going to say things to push your boundaries. You already admitted you know she doesn\u2019t mean it when she says that. She even admitted she didn\u2019t mean it. So why did you still feel the need to teach her some kind of weird lesson? \n\nYou are the adult and her guardian - you\u2019re supposed to be providing her with a safe and constant home no matter what. You\u2019re supposed to be the one person she can always feel safe and secure with. Apologize to her and do better moving forward.", "I'm torn here. On one hand I can see how other people get upset because they aren't in your shoes. On the other hand, when my daughter kept threatening to live with her dad after we divorced I finally wiped my tears and told her that if she really wanted to then we would get schools switched and she could. That was the last time I ever heard that from her and that was 2 years ago. She sees her dad 50/50 but I never had her actually go stay with him that wasn't custody time.", "NAH  \nShe's entering her teenage years, she's gonna throw an attitude, but that doesn't give her a get out of jail free card with abusing your feelings. What you did is tough love, whether or not the timing of it was good or if you jumped to quickly, I don't know, but young teens and adults at some point need to face the reality and consequences of their own words.   \n\n\nBecause of her past, has she been seeing a therapist? Usually when I meet children who threaten that they will run away or go live with someone else, it usually stems from deeper issues of abandonment or trust issues.", "NTA.   She said something hurtful multiple times.  It was a consequence of her own actions.   One week is not abandonment.   You told her parameters and told her you were coming back.\n\nYou probably need to talk to her about this though.  Tell her that her words hurt because you love her, want her and that this is her permanent home if she wants it.  Ask her how it made her feel as well so she feels heard.  Good luck.", "You should watch the movie Spirited on AppleTV. Same script.", "YTA.  She realized she spoke in anger.  She has been through living hell, so you can expect her to lash out now and again.   You forced her to go stay for a week with people she \"didn't have much of a relationship with\" and seem surprised she's mad?\n\nYou shouldn't have made her go there.  Apologize for that.    And stop spoiling her.", "YTA. You made a mistake, but I think an apology could help a lot. You're obviously doing your best and love your niece.  She is a child who has lost both parents and is coping with that trauma. Teenagers sometimes lash out and it's normal to feel hurt by that, but after she acknowledged that she was wrong, you guys should have had a discussion about why \"I'm going to go live with my other uncle\" is her go-to when things get difficult at home. She's testing to see if she'll be abandoned by you. Keep in mind that this may not be a conscious process on her part. \n\nIt might be helpful to talk with a therapist together and separately. This is a tough situation and the trauma of losing parents can resurface at various times in her life. A professional might be able to help.", "NTA--you taught her words have consequences. This was a pretty tame and controlled one. You didnt abandon her. You didn't kick her out and ban her from returning.", "YTA be an adult. Your niece lost her parents and is gonna act out DUH. Why don\u2019t you talk to her and get her counseling and see what kind of actives like sports or clubs she\u2019d like. Make this easier for her", "NTA, you niece is very lucky that you adopted her and are raising her. I would have done the same thing.", "YTA. Even kids who have not lost both parents lash out at their parents/guardians. Instead of realizing she is lashing out and is dealing with the trauma of being a teenager and loosing her parents, you decide to be a massive A.H. and send her away even though she told you she didn\u2019t mean it. Can you be any more of an A.H.??? You should apologize to her and let her know you were wrong, made a big mistake, that you love her, and won\u2019t abandon her again,", "Wow, YTA - you do realize she's a kid, right? And they often blow off steam/express themselves hyperbolically. Surely you've noticed this. And her parents are dead.  So you thought it was ok to \"teach her a lesson\" and send her packing. Good job further traumatizing a kid who's already been through too much in her life.", "YTA. This is no different than a child of divorced parents saying \"I want to go live with (mom/dad - whoever the 'other' parent is). but you dont actually send your child to that other parent to live as punishment.\n\nShe is hitting puberty now and she is questioning everything. I remember at this age each of my kids went through the 'everyone hates me' stage. (for about 2 weeks). and the 'doesnt wash their hair' stage. and the 'pushing the boundries' stage. and and and.\n\nSending her away was not a good call on your part - all it told her was that she was expendable. and that despite you adopting her, you were just fine giving her away.\n\nIt also told her that acting out and expressing herself to you wasnt acceptable. and that it would be met with punishment.\n\nShe told you that she didnt mean it. At that point your response should have been to ask her why she felt the need to lash out at you that way. and then communicate with her and help her to communicate with you in a more positive way.\n\nBecause of the trauma of losing both her parents and her whole world changing so drastically, it might not be a bad idea to get her (and you) into therapy to work though some of these things.\n\nThe 'teen years' are hard enough without adding trauma into the mix.", "YTA; this is a 13 year old who has been through some heavy stuff.  If you think this is an \u201cannoying habit\u201d you haven\u2019t seen anything yet. Put yourself in her shoes, you\u2019re not arguing with a fully functioning adult that you can call out on their BS. \nSpoiling her because you can afford it doesn\u2019t compensate for the compassion and love she needs.", "NTA. You called her bluff, and made her feel the consequences of her actions. You limited the punishment within defined and reasonable parameters and made it clear that it was not abandonment. IRL, people won't let her backtrack once she pushes too far, so you let her learn in a controlled environment", "> I know she doesn't mean it because 1. she barely knows her other uncle 2. I have a high paying job and I'm able to provide things that most people aren't able to provide so she is too spoiled to be able to live with anyone else\n\nYOU created this problem with her because YOU spoiled her instead of parenting her. YTA.", "YTA. You're her parent. That wasn't parenting.", "Wtf. You kicked out a girl who has lost both her parents? An unbelievable trauma. She was expressing her unhappiness. It\u2019s what kids do. Instead of acting like a child and kicking her out you need to learn to listen properly and make her feel understood. Be a grown up. \n\nAnd having lots of money doesn\u2019t make you a good person. I\u2019d rather live with someone kind and caring than a rich asshole. \n\nYTA", "YTA.  You need to go to parenting classes.  You need to get her to therapy.  I can't imagine what she's going through after losing both parents and having to live with you.  Then you basiclly give her away.", "> I told her that she should go anyway, she'll stay for a week and then she can tell me if she wants to stay there or come back home.\n\nI think you should have listened to her when she said she didn't want to go. On the other hand you did tell her that it was only for 1 week, it's not like you sent her away forever.\n\nMild yta. It was a mistake, especially as she was orphaned at 9 and is now a teenager - sending her to live with someone else even temporarily when she needs stability and security, mistake. Perhaps family therapy (or just talking with a child psychologist individually) could be helpful to go forward.\n\n> My family heard what happened and now everyone is mad at me and thinks I'm an asshole\n\nTake a deep breath. You're the parent now. You have to fix this. But nobody is perfect and it's understandable that you mess up sometimes. Live and learn.", "What if it was his nephew and not his niece? I kinda think everyone might be being a little extra harsh on OP because he gave a tough live lesson to a girl instead of a boy.\n\nSo I think OP should've taught this lesson, but the execution in this way? Damn...I think I would've reached out 3 or 4 days later and went and picked her up personally. I don't think I would've let it ride the entire week. So maybe the delivery was a bit unforgiving.\n\nHowever, follow through is so incredibly important for childhood and teenage development. So I think you were right to stick to your word on taking her there to begin with. I also commend you for taking up someone else's kiddo as your own. You're gonna make mistakes along the way, this was at least a 30% wrong one here, but it's not like you took her out and left her at a hotel. LMAO.\n\nNow that it's done though, try to exercise more effective routes of connection and trust building with her. Not to mention, healthy defiance and authority questioning. She's gonna need you one day and that day is gonna be really hard for her to go to anyone, make sure you're the obvious answer and avenue for her for that day.", "YTA she is young you are the parent. Parenting is hard. Parenting a kid who lost both her parents is awful. Do better than threatening to kick her out.", "She is 13. As a dad of a teenage girl, you need to get better at parenting. You were okay right up until you made her go anyway. I would have saved that for the scenario if she did it again after that conversation. She already backtracked and realized you would follow through so she humbled herself which was the right response on her end. You took if further than you needed to and damaged her and your relationship with her. You need to do something now to correct it and talk to her.\n\nI was a rational girl even as a teenager i didn't give my parents trouble the way other teens did. However even then, as rational and together as i was, as a teen i still had emotional outbursts. Not many, like a few total lol but i still had them and i grew up and feel so terrible when i remember the things i said and did at that those times. My parents laugh about it now but i can imagine in those moments i hurt their feelings.", "YTA\n\nYou are the grown up. Act like it. Her attitude is not abnormal for a teenager. It is incumbent upon you to rise above the rude temper tantrums and be a constant source of stability and safety in her life. She has lost both parents so early. Please don't shake the foundation that she has left by letting her attitude get your goat like you did here. When she apologized, you should have discussed why her behavior was unacceptable and stopped threatening her. \n\nWe all get angry. Raising kids is damned hard. But keep trying. You can do this.", "YTA.\n\nShe said she didn't mean it. You \"punishing\" her by sending her to live with someone who isn't as rich as you are... that's kinda sick.

Because she IS yours. And the thing she needs to know, when she is saying typical teenage stuff, is that you won't abandon her.\n\nShe is a child. Children say stupid things.

We have no extended family. My kid can't even say \"I'd rather go live with (insert relative)!\"\n\nBut my kid does occasionally say something like \"I wish I lived anywhere but here!\" or \"Maybe I should go live at (friend's house!) At least their parents are chill!\"\n\nAnd... never once has my child actually meant it. I understand that because my child is 13, and 13 year olds are... well...

It's inappropriate, and their need to be repercussions if it *continues*.\n\nThe first time my child acted this way, we talked about how hurtful those words can be.

Can we figure out some other way you can tell me you are really pissed or overwhelmed?\"", "YTA, and massively so.\n\nYour niece is a child who experienced the significant childhood trauma of losing both parents. Many children who have lost one or both parents have issues around parental-figure abandonment. \n\nYoung teenagehood is tough on many kids from idyllic family situations - individuation, or the act of distancing themselves from adult family, is a normal part of adolescent development. How many of those kids also end up telling their parents they wish they had other parents, could live with their gramma or best friends family instead? Hurtful, but a typical part of development. \n\nIt\u2019s also common for kids who have lost parents and have alternate caregivers, to test their caregivers to see if their place with them is truly secure. If that love and care is unconditional, or not. It is unlikely that your niece feels as secure with you than she did with her parents, even if you\u2019re a fabulous caregiver, because she already experienced two devastating losses. So she\u2019s going to continue to test her place in your life. \n\nAnd you just showed her that you won\u2019t fight for her. \n\n\nWhen you adopted her, did you get any training in parenting traumatized youth? \n\nI\u2019m a former therapeutic foster carer of that age group. Here\u2019s a couple recs if you\u2019re interested:\n\n-TBRI training (search on YouTube for a brief overview, there are books and seminar trainings) \n-Youth mental health first aid (ask your community center about this)\n-Nicholeen Peck\u2019s Teaching Self Government \n-Get her an adoption-competent therapist\n-Love and Logic by Cline\n-Ask adult adoptees their perspective in spaces that elevate adult adoptee voices.

You took her in and adopted her, and despite the challenges, you became the closest thing to her real parents that she has.  And what did you just tell her?

To be honest, she would\u2019ve continued to do this until you set clear boundaries that this is not ok. Now to OP - you also behaved badly. You are the adult. I know hindsight is 20/20, so I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt that you understand now that you also contributed to this beast. You said it yourself when you said you spoiled her. I can understandably see why you chose to pack her bag and make her stay for a week. She did need to learn that her words have consequences. However, there was a much better way to handle this. In the future, sit down and have a calm, civil conversation with each other about how words can be hurtful and have consequences. I can tell that y\u2019all are close.

She's not talking to you because she feels like you betrayed her trust. You, as her guardian always, always, ALWAYS have to be the bigger person. She will face natural consequences in her life, and she can have natural consequences in your home, but punishing her by giving her a non-consensual \"vacation\" with near strangers who she knows COULD have been her \"real\" family if you hadn't taken her in.

It was 1 week. Summer camps tend to last longer than that. OP would be an AH if the time frame wasn't given up front because that really would feel like abandonment.\n\nMaybe 1 week was too long. Even just a sleepover could have gotten the main point across.

That's where op became the asshole, that kid has been through alot and op just proved she's one chance of being upset over something before being tossed out again. \n\nThe teen had also become an asshole when they kept saying repeatedly they want to live with that man.
