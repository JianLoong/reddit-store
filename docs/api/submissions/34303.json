You r wife had just started dating you and fell pregnant then gets insulted by that giant AH and she's told she is unreasonable for not letting it go without an apology. Yep, you've got a huge AH hubby problem as in he does not have your back and, in this situation, considering what was said to her before, during and after the pregnancy. It even made the hubby CRY and she should just get over it.....bullshit.", "How early?  Are we talking weeks?", "Yeah, that's the thing, right? He was 'looking out for' his brother.

You shouldn't have to have been anywhere near him because your hubby should have your back. Their AH jokes after the baby was born made him CRY but you should just get over it. I keep repeating this because it makes me so damn mad. Your hubby is a giant AH for not seeing to it that he is never anywhere you are going to be and he shouldn't be driving him, in a car you'll have to sit in, anywhere. The man said the worst thing you could ever say to a newly pregnant stranger let alone partner of your nephew. Said it to the point where it got brought back up at the birth. By then it was probably just his siblings being AHs and he didmt stop that either. He cried to the wife who had been harmed by this for months.

Really?\"", "NTA, The issue is the person harped on it, didn't handle it well and then didn't apologize. If they're talking behind your back, that's not cool. \n\nI don't think there is anything wrong with suggesting a paternity test with someone after 4 weeks of dating. I could see why you would think \"they think I'm a cheater/bad person\" but after 4 weeks you don't REALLY know the character of the person you slept with either. In fact, a paternity test was should have been a given.", "Your husband is ok with it because his reputation and moral integrity weren\u2019t impugned -yours were.   They called into question the legitimacy of your child even on the day of their birth. And your husband is ok with that. \n\nDo not let this destroy your happiness but also do not let this stand.

If he wants you to get over it he should APOLOGIZE. Even then you are not required to forgive him for that. He not only insinuated that you cheated but got a bunch of other family members speculating on the babies heritage the day it was born for crying out loud.  \n\nI have a borderline birthday between two signs and I remember reading a page on Scorpios that said they may forgive but will never forget even a perceived slight. Definitley a Scorpio here.

Who is the carbon copy of my husband. My fil and i don't talk and to this day still argues he had a right. No one else in my husbands family questioned whether my son was his.

Id say nta because ive gone through it myself", "What the relative did was unforgivable; absolutely, utterly unforgivable. That your husband has glossed over it is a bad mark on his record, too.

This is time for the social \"cut dead\", where that person doesn't exist, you don't speak to them or of them, you do not even acknowledge their existence.\n\nYour husband needs to get on your side, he should be your champion in this; after all, it was your honor that was questioned. You're NTA here, but your husband's family has it all time over.", "His fidelity isn't being questioned his wife's is.

Your husband was offended, but you are the one who was essentially called a whore. Husband  needs to have your back. With no apology from the offender, he\u2019s left the insult standing for five years. The drunk uncle and your husband are both jerks. Ask your husband how he would like to see his kid on alternate weekends since he can\u2019t stand up for his wife.", "Ehhh... ESH. Soft on your side, but ESH still. \n\n5 years is a long time to hold this grudge and still be holding onto emotional turmoil over it. \n\nFrom your comments you were only in a relationship with your now husband for 1 month. They were most definitely an AH, behavior and comment wise. It was rude as hell, but 5 years to not be able to be around the individual? \n\nI understand 100% you having no respect for the in-law and not liking them. You don't have too, and have that right.  But to ruin your own ability to be involved with your husbands family due to if that in-law is present, and holding so strongly to such an emotional weight and burden is unhealthy.\n\nYour spouse sucks for not validating your feelings and telling you to get over it, but you probably do need to tru to look into finding a healthy way to deal with the WHY it still bothers you so long ago. \n\nYou say you want an apology, have you stated that to the person? You're an adult, communicate. \n\"This was a long time ago, you had concerns and very rudely and publically shamed me. I feel I deserve an apology from you, even now so many years later because you were so disrespectful.\"  Granted, they may not apologize, but you will have said your piece.\n\nEditing to add this next part after commenting on someone elses judgement: OP have you gotten evaluated at all within the 5 years for PPD? We women go through a LOT of changes, and there could be ties to your MH over why you're holding onto this emotional hurt so firmly. If you haven't,  or if youve thought you're fine, maybe you need to talk it out with a professional. Its ok to dislike and lose respect for the person, but you're hurting yourself in the long run.", "Your husband is an ass.  NTA.", "Yta. Hopefully he got a secret paternity test\n. Men never know.", "NAH. Every man should always get a paternity test when the baby is born. You can be insulted by it, sure, but that's just common sense for the man.", "NTA\n\nWanting an apology is not asking much. But holding a deep grudge can be detrimental to your health, and, hard as it might be, sometimes moving on is the best thing to do. In cases like this, I go with forgive but not forget; I've had to do that several times. Yes, it's hard, but I personally have found it has lifted a weight.\n\nDoes your in-law know how much this hurt you? Being drunk can make people say ridiculous things, even though it's no excuse.  \nI only ask since they might offer an apology if they did, I just wonder if your husband made it clear enough.\n\nNot saying you ought to socialise closely though.", "NTA, and this is the classic \u201cI may have an in law problem, but the real problem is my significant other\u201d.

It sounds like your hurt and anger has morphed into resentment, which makes sense. Not only were you publicly embarrassed by this, but it sounds like no one in the family ever apologized to you, even though many of them witnessed the incident and were later involved in gossip that reached you. (Do they know you were made aware of the texts they were sending around the baby's birth?) You may want to have another discussion with your husband, because I imagine he's already started a fire of resentment within you which will only grow as your feelings continue to be invalidated. Resentment feeds on itself.", "I would have dumped my husband right then and there TBH.", "Fell pregnant? Like you tripped and boom you were knocked up?", "NTA, but your husband is.  He literally chose said family member over you.  That's messed up.  This person caused a bit of a scandal & had ppl talking about you & the baby & whether or not it was your husband's.  This family member is a total asshole for causing such an issue.  And now your husband owes you an apology too.", "Her fidelity wasn't necessarily questioned though. OP commented that her and husband at the time were in a new relationship at only 1 month together when she got pregnant. If anything the assumption may had been she was already pregnant and was trying to baby trap him. \n\nIs it an asshole thing to say? 100%, that inlaw was completely an AH. But 5 years to not be able to even be in the car as them? OP seems to have a really unhealthy emotional burden from this. I'm not saying she has to like or respect the inlaw at all, and husband definitely should be more supportive of her feelings; but I can also see how he also got hurt by the accusation and fear with the timeline of when the pregnancy was announced. People are quick to say husband problem, but he also had his own emotions from the accustation, OP mentioned he broke down crying on what was supposed to be a happy occasion with the birth of their child from the stress of his family having that nasty assumption he wasn't the father. \n\nThe only difference is he's let it go and honestly to me it contextually reads like OP seems upset he isn't still emotionally suffering like she is. \nWomen take years to recover post partum (i know first hand) and maybe its tied to PPD.  Her husband absolutely should still be more understanding than he is being. But OP just seems to be holding onto this in a really unhealthy way and seems to be avoiding speaking to the inlaw where she herself could try to handle this better by communicating she needs an apology to help her gain closure.", "I am always shook by all these women seemingly allowing their husbands to steamroll over them (and sometimes the opposite too, but it\u2019s often women taking shit from shitty husbands).", "This is true. OP has drawn the boundary and that's fine. Moving on lets you focus on bigger, better things.", "I guess it also depends on how your BIL usually behaves and what kind of relationship you want with him. If it was an isolated incident you might want to try smooth it out.  You should let him now how humiliated you felt back then and that he should apologize to you. As you said in another comment, if he had doubts, he should have express them privately (4 weeks is pretty short so it was kind of inevitable there would be some questions).", "Yes, he was just looking at for family. That\u2019s reasonable. But then he should have apologized for assuming something so horrible about you. I\u2019m really surprised you\u2019ve let your husband allow the disrespect for so long.", "Make him understand by giving him an ultimatum. And this is gonna sound harsh but TBH clearly he understands. He just doesn\u2019t give that much of a shit.", "Your husband is the problem. It's just a matter of how long you choose to be unhappy before you get divorced", "Please stop avoid arguments and absolutely refuse to ever drive this person anywhere.  Each time your husband asks or tells you to give this AH a ride home, reply \"You want me to give a ride to the person who called me a cheater and still thinks that because they have never apologized for calling me a cheater?  My answer is NO!\"", "The Problem ls not really the did respect of this inlaw, its the disrespecet yoir husband in tolerating his behaviour.", " I'd be asking him why should you even stay together.  You can divorce his ass, collect child support, and maybe possibly marry into a family that will actually love/respect you.  I'd push right back. What does he offer that you can't find elsewhere plus the bonus of a loving family? It wasn't the brother protecting him if they were still joking about it 9 months later. It was misogynistic bullying.", "The bad thing is doing it in front of op, but if my brother got with a girl and that girl end up pregnant after 4 weeks of relationship, I would question if the kid is his or even if she baby trapped him.\n\nSorry OP but I don't begrudge them for doubting, now true they should have apologized", "You have a husband problem if he is willing to have anything to do with this person.", "That is really early in a relationship.\n\nI can see why there may have been questions.\n\nSorry OP, but I see their point.

If he had concerns for his brother ( my husband) i wouldn\u2019t have an issue if he said it privately.", "Was it rude? Yes\n\nwas it completely out of left field? No\n\nBecause of this, honestly just let it go.

You haven't even warmed up yet!  My cousin's obnoxious husband insulted and humiliated my 9-year-old self in front of my entire family and refused to apologize.  He died 2 years ago, and I never exchanged one word with him in the intervening 60 years.  We were in the same location many times, but not one word passed between us.\n\nNTA - that drunken in-law should have apologized the instant they sobered up.  They thought they were being funny (so did my cousin's husband) but they need lessons in both humor and appropriateness.  Tell your husband that you think it is wonderful he can forgive such an insult to your character and morals without the in-law ever apologizing for their deplorable behavior, but you can't.  \n\nHowever, in the future, make sure you never let the presence of that person keep you from attending family events again.  Rent a second car, get an Uber, whatever you need to do, but do not let that jerk keep you from being with your family.  And if they ever speak to you, stare them in the eye for 10 seconds without speaking and then turn your back to them.", "Why didn\u2019t the in law think that the kid was your now husbands ?", "They never apologized for their treatment of you? NTA\n\nit would have been kind of you to tolerate the family member at the event but for your family to do him such a kindness and expect you to sit there?\n\nThe only option would have been to go along and verbally put the knife in the whole time \"So you still gonna ask about paternity tests?\"\n\n\"You going to keep this up all night?\"\n\n\"Yup\"", "Personally I would have gone and once the in-law was trapped in the car, I would have started with: So, what made you think I was cheating on husband exactly? What made you think I lied about the father? Do you still think I cheat on him? Do you suggest every guy you know get a paternity test when they have children or am I just the one you think is a cheater? And I would badger that in law the whole way. But no, you are NTA. Your husband is for deciding it's not important enough to deal with. He should have confronted the person and everyone else bandying this around and shut it down. Now he's just saying it's okay they did it. Not cool.", "Since he's so insistent on taking this relative. Tell your husband you want a paternity test. So he can give it to his family member. Get couples therapy. I'd be more concerned by your husband then his family.", "NTA\n\nHere\u2019s my recommendation, you have a husband problem and he needs a warning disguised as a solution. \u201cHubs, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s been five years and seeing X person still hurts me deeply, at this point I\u2019ll be seeking out therapy to learn why this is and what I should be doing about it. I\u2019ve tried to feel the support from my friends and family, I\u2019ve tried to let bygones be bygones I\u2019ve even given x person rides, I suck it up and repress my emotions every single year on our child\u2019s birthday, and none of that helps. The pain is still as fresh as the day it happened. I realize now that I\u2019m going to have to seek outside support, you\u2019ve all moved past my trauma and now I need to as well. I\u2019m not exactly sure what that will look like, how it will happen, or what the result will be for the relationships in my life but I want to try to heal for myself and our child. I understood you perfectly yesterday, this is the last time I\u2019ll bring up my concerns to you. I just wanted to let you know so I could move forward. In the meantime, I won\u2019t be spending time around x person and I\u2019m going to ask you to respect that, I\u2019m doing this so I can heal and I can\u2019t be around the person/people that cause me pain while doing so.\u201d \n\nYou tell him that or write it down and give it to him. Something needs to change and honestly you both have some work to do if you want this relationship to work. From the outside, and only having read this post, you ARE allowing something that happened five years ago to affect you. That horrendous man should have no affect on you, you should be able to look him in the eye with a calm indifference knowing he doesn\u2019t mean jack $hit to you and he never will, you should be making peace with the fact that while you might deserve an apology you may never receive one (and even then, it might not be the way you want). You have to find closure within yourself instead of trying to get it from other people. Please go to therapy. \n\nAs for your husband, he\u2019s insensitive, cruel, harsh, unsupportive, etc. my partner told me one of my friends made him uncomfortable and my immediate reaction was \u201chow do you want to handle this? Should I stop speaking with her, do you never want her in our home, what can I do to make you feel safe and supported?\u201d Your hubs isn\u2019t even doing the bare minimum, he shouldn\u2019t be forcing you to have contact with people that have disrespected you. No matter how much time has passed he should still be telling his family to apologize. He should be supporting you and asking you what you need to feel safe and supported instead of trying to ignore the fact that this is all happening. \n\nYou and your partner are supposed to be a united front, but from here it looks like he\u2019s happy as long as he isn\u2019t inconvenienced and I\u2019m 100% convinced that you deserve better than that.", "NTA.", "I dont know why you are suprised that the family had doubts about the father when you were JUST 4 WEEK TOGETHER  like that kinda resonable. \nIt is rude to say it to yor face but if i was in the brother shoes i would probly question it myself just not to your face. \n\nAlso holding all this resentment and anger this long is bad for your health like actually can make you sick.\n\nAfter 5 years maybe try seeing it from the perspective of the famliy. How will they know that just after 4 weeks its their brother/son baby? I mean a LOTTT  can happen in your privte life and i guess they did not know you enough time to know your moral rights (if you cheat/serious/casual or not) \n\nYou dont have to forgive but you do have to be civil and from your comments you dont sound like it. \nLike it or not you also marry into family. \n\nAnd your husbands is actually fine.

Cuz if not and you left it to your husband its like saying that you dont think you are apart of your husband family. \nYou are married meaning you are family to your in laws. \n\nBut ill be honest its too late to get a sincere apology. \n\nDo they treat your kid the same with the other kids? \n\nIf the answer is yes thats all that actually matters"]}
