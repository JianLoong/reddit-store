Nah, I\u2019d never forgive any of them either.

Who were the people \"shooting texts around\" about your baby on the night she was born?  Did they apologise?", "WTF?   NTA,  but your husband and this asshole sure are.  There would have been stronger words spoken.   I am baffled that hubby drove him.", "NTA. Tell your partner that his brother can apologise or you will just have nothing to do with him. \n\nHold that grudge, he probably still thinks he is right about it.", "NTA\n\nWhat he said to you must have been very hurtful.\n\nStand your ground and refuse to go, refuse to share a car.", "I have a BIL similar to this.

If you don't want to have anything to do with this person your husband just needs to \"get over it.\" He makes it sound so easy.", "NTA - you don't have to forget or forgive. Especially when no apology has been given. Letting it go is benefits one person, but that person isn't you.", "NTA - 5 years is a long time but what he said was shitty regardless of his drunken demeanor. You need to get thicker skin around this guy and if he throws anymore shots your way, send some right back. Husband is trying to not start drama within his family but is forgetting you now come before his family and not taking your side is ridiculous.", "Yeah, it's a waste of time, energy, and your life force to hold onto a grudge.

I hope you can work it out.", "Yup, you don't just have an inlaws problem,  have a husband problem... that's a much bigger problem...", "It was because i got pregnant early in the relationship. And the people shooting the texts were his family but one accidentally sent it to a friend of his who sent it to him", "That would be, his brother. His brother said it in front of everybody then leaned in. Has never apologized in 5 years. Hubby is lucky she didn't leave with the baby from the hospital followed by making it hard for him and that \"family\" to even see the child. OMG...what a bunch of numptys.", "My husbands take is that his brother was just looking out for him. But he didnt have to do it publicly wnd my husband doesnt seem to understand how humiliated i felt", "Yes it hurt then and it still hurts now, im reminded of it on my daughter\u2019s  birthday every year and when i see this in law. It has happened before where we have been out and my husband offered for me to drive this person home and ive done it to avoid arguments, but this time i just couldnt because he didnt even ask me or consider my feelings", "What choice? Just give in and be chauffeur to someone who is an ah?", "I see your point but something so hurtful is not so easy to just get over. Hard to move on when she's stuck with this family.", "She does indeed. Hubby should be pissed still, on her behalf. Guarantee if someone had said that about him he'd have not gotten over it but women are supposed to always be the bigger person no matter how we are verbally abused. You r wife had just started dating you and fell pregnant then gets insulted by that giant AH and she's told she is unreasonable for not letting it go without an apology. Yep, you've got a huge AH hubby problem as in he does not have your back and, in this situation, considering what was said to her before, during and after the pregnancy. It even made the hubby CRY and she should just get over it.....bullshit.", "How early?  Are we talking weeks?", "Yeah, that's the thing, right? He was 'looking out for' his brother. But he completely disregarded your feelings and acted like they didn't matter. \n\nTell your husband that you are glad that he feels 'looked out for', but that you were publicly embarrassed at that same moment. His feelings of being 'looked out for'/protected aren't more important than you feeling humiliated.", "And you shouldn't have. You shouldn't have to have been anywhere near him because your hubby should have your back. Their AH jokes after the baby was born made him CRY but you should just get over it. I keep repeating this because it makes me so damn mad. Your hubby is a giant AH for not seeing to it that he is never anywhere you are going to be and he shouldn't be driving him, in a car you'll have to sit in, anywhere. The man said the worst thing you could ever say to a newly pregnant stranger let alone partner of your nephew. Said it to the point where it got brought back up at the birth. By then it was probably just his siblings being AHs and he didmt stop that either. He cried to the wife who had been harmed by this for months. Your pregnancy and birth stories will now have this ugliness in them for the rest of your life. So, you are NTAH but you're owed a huge apology by the uncle and bigger ones from your own husband.", "Tell your husband that he's being a dumb dumb for ignoring your feelings about this \"friend\".", "4 weeks. Does that make a difference? If his sibling had concerns he could have said it privately.", "Sorry.....it was his brother he allowed to speak that way about his partner. Nope, that makes it even worse. He can't even claim weird cultural respect your elders bullshit. He let his brother disrespect her like that. Hell,He'll, no, don't ever give in without that apology and frankly, 5 years later, I'd forgive you for not letting it go after the forced apology which never mean squat anyway.", "This friend is his sibling"]}
