But I have 3 friends who own moving companies so I'm in the unique position of understanding the industry more than most. Some of the best movers are not big guys. And some of the biggest guys make terrible movers. Endurance and technique play a big roll. \n\nAside from the heaviest items that you physically can't help lift were you helping with side tables, chairs , boxes etc? If not you're kind of the asshole. Unless you REALLY did all the packing and prep. Then it should have been brought up to the family. Bc moving other ppls shit sucks", "NTA. I am sick of seeing people who have no business doing heavy lifts being pressured into it. If someone can't team lift, either from size or lack of experience, they need to stay away.

But its not clear that everyone else was aware of this.

It feels like they just don't want to do the hard work and are more than happy to let other people do the heavy lifting of their own shit.  \n\nYou probably should have tried helping once or twice.  If you were really useless in doing it, they probably would have told you not to worry about it.

There is no reasoning or trying to defend with some people so I wouldn't engage further or let it bother you.", "Ummm ... your BF is maybe the (soft) AH for not making the division of labor clear to his family. You offered to help with the heavy lifting, and he's the one who said no. Size/strength is no excuse for at least trying to help ... but you offered and were diverted to the weak-person chores. It sounds like your BF's family didn't realize that had happened and were surprised that someone who is young/healthy albeit with poor physical conditioning didn't \"help\" more with their own move. From their perspective, an older arthritic but bigger uncle should perhaps have been similarly be diverted to the weak-person chores, especially since they're helping you out and not the other way around.", "I'm going to go soft YTA here. I've helped plenty of people move over the years. I've always understood it that EVERYONE, regardless of size, is moving something. Not big enough to move the couch? That's fine, bring the cushions. Bring the boxes planned to be on top. Cleaning and straightening up is something you AND bf should do later that day, or the next, after the people there helping you for free are gone. Effectively, you're extending their day by not focusing on the task at hand (moving) and on the task that doesn't involve those helping you for free.

It\u2019s hard and sometimes counterproductive to do actual cleaning until most of the stuff is outside. And for the packing- by the time moving day comes, usually everything is already packed away and we did that together. \nIf you single handedly packed all of his stuff in addition to yours and cleaned everything, your boyfriend is lazy.

Its super hard to lift stuff when you're short and the person helping lift it is a giant.", "Yeah and it's like, I've been in the reverse situation, hurting myself because I was in an awkward position trying to team lift with someone significantly shorter than I was and trying to bend in a way that I wouldn't end up hurting *them*. Either way would be dangerous and it was for the best in this case for the shortest person to do activities that could be done solo.", "Yea thats kind of the vibe i got too...", "While you aren't wrong, I'm also not going to just assume anything that isn't in the post.  If OP had some physical ailments to why they couldn't lift a box, I assume they would have said so.  \n\nBut in general, it sounds like they moved NOTHING to the truck.  If that is the case, I'd be pissed too.  Even if you can only carry clothing boxes, then make some trips with those clothing boxes.  Because at least it appears to everyone else that you are helping with the actual task of moving, not just using the other people as labor to make these other things that can be done later, easier for you", "The \"something else\" was a harder, more time consuming, and less glorious job.  Plus he had his boyfriends blessing.  They should be the ones running the show.", "Right.  \n\nI've been in this situation before as one of the guy friends asked to help move.  The wife sitting there packing shit up and doing stuff that, frankly, could've been done before or after the actual move, was pretty damn annoying.", "Well, ain\u2019t that some weird sexist bullshit. \n\nI\u2019m gay and I\u2019ve helped several gay couples move. It\u2019s pretty obvious that some people are better suited to lifting and some are better suited to packing and cleaning. They\u2019re all necessary tasks and some people need to do each one. I personally would prefer to lift the heavy stuff. Plus, OP offered to help and was rebuffed. Should he have just done it anyway?\n\nOP, you are 100% NTA here. I can see why the dad might be a bit grumpy if he\u2019s old and tired from helping, but he can keep his comments to himself \u2014 you clearly had enough muscle helping with the furniture.", "Size can also matter.  If there is a large height disparity, one of you ends up either gripping somewhere that's not ideal or carrying more weight because it's not level between you.  Think of being the bottom person carrying something down stairs.  The bottom person is holding most of the load. If you're shorter, your arms are always a bit lower.  My husband and I are near the same height,  so we work well together.  But I've worked with people five inches shorter, and I can tell the difference even at that bit.  \n\nThat said,  if there were boxes to load,  I've run boxes before while being unable to lift much on a move.  Once they're stacked, it's easy to get a dolly under and run them into the truck.  That's another great use of a person who should not help with the furniture.", "Uhm why not?! If he wouldnt have been any help at all anyways because he isnt strong then why isnt him doing other packing good enough?", "Moving - isn't just moving furniture ; it's cleaning, packing and moving boxes. It's also moving stuff that can't be put in boxes. I have worked for a moving company .", "She's pretty good at cleaning, we all chip in together in this house.", "OP is male.", "I did try to help with furniture when we started moving but because of the hight difference between me and my bf anything we carried would be on a slant and I did nearly get crushed by a desk.", "OP is male, I think.", "Him.", "they were doing a favour to his boyfriend, who also lives there.", "They actually just mentioned moving a heavy TV Cabinet I don't know if we are assuming they didn't move anything at all. I might need more coffee though.", ">The \"something else\" was a harder, more time consuming, and less glorious job.\n\nSo is cleaning a toilet. What part of you asking for my help means I'm doing it without you?", "That's my takeaway. I've helped people move probably 30+ times over my life. The only ones that sucks are where someone isn't already packed - or they aren't helping.\n\nYou cleaning your place has nothing to do with me being here to help you load a truck.

I'm 5'4 while my bf is 6'3 and his family are 6 foot or over too. As for boxes I was packing them and taking them to the truck.", "He could have helped carry furniture he is just using his size as an excuse.", "Ok, fair enough. \n\nEither way, I stand by my points.  The stuff OP was doing wasn't making the move easier for everyone, it was doing something that helped himself out later.", "Yeah, someone pointed that out.  \n\nIt doesn't really change any of my arguments though.  Guy or girl, they are still doing a favor for OP so the idea of them being able to screw off when they gave up a day to assist them just comes off as really shitty", "noted.  doesn't change any of my points.", "I mean, if both of their shit is getting moved, its a favor to them both.", "Right.  That is all that was mentioned. but based on context, I'm guessing there was more than that. OP says the others came over to help load the moving truck.  So my guess is that if they rented a moving truck, they were loading up more than one item.", "Exactly. \n\nOP and his partner chose to wait to pack, and use time where people are moving stuff into the truck to clean.  They are wasting the time of the other people. \n\nAre we really to believe there were no boxes or anything he could've taken to the truck during this time?", "Yeah,  you're a solid partner.  I'd take you in a move any day over anyone who thinks the job is done when the furniture is moved.", "Some people are just too weak to carry heavy stuff like furniture. Why dont you get that", "And they did mention that they offered to help and their BF said no, so maybe the BF knows the abilities of their partner more than their father does? Anyway I think NTA simply because we all have our different abilities and they did still contribute and offer to help.", "Right.  But that doesn't automatically negate other people being upset by it. \n\nMy initial judgment was NAH.  Because I get the optics are bad.  and as someone who helped one of my good friends move, and he essentially told his wife the same, I was still annoyed.  Again, sure, maybe she'd be useless in helping move a couch, but there were plenty of smaller boxes she could have moved.  Because the pile of boxes still had to be moved aside from the big stuff, so her taking a bunch so we had to make fewer trips would have been appreciated"]}
