She brings home her laundry and has you do it, who's the one making \"demands\" here?\n\nI think you should kindly, nicely, and gently tell her that perhaps she should do her own laundry, as you don't want any misunderstandings or arguments, and you love her too much to argue over laundry when she can maintain her privacy by simply doing it herself (or paying to have it sent out).\n\nYour wife should have suggested this as well. IN my mind, you have someone doing your cleaning/washing for you as a favor - there aren't expectations of privacy.", "NTA. She expects you to wash, dry, and fold laundry but not ask questions? That's crazy.\n\nYour next question should be, \"Why did me asking a question about the laundry you had me wash and fold upset you so much?\" She told you that some items belonging to female friends would be included in the laundry she tasked you with washing. She didn't mention male items. So it seems natural to ask a question or two.\n\nPerhaps she has a female, nonbinary, or trans significant other. That might explain why she got upset at being asked about maybe having a boyfriend.", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, your stepdaughter should be doing her own laundry. She's in college now, your logic about \"not being good at the stuff\" applies to twelve years olds. I think if I'd taken home piles and piles of unwashed laundry when I was a freshman my parents would have laughed me out the door. You should say she can come home to do laundry and use your machines, and you'll show her how to do it the first few times. I know that wasn't your question but... seriously. Also, the thought of my parents touching my used unmentionables is... uncomfortable to say the least. \n\nSecond, if she had just been doing laundry at home and you went through her laundry or something, maybe her reaction would have been justified. She's asking you to wash undergarments, it's perfectly reasonable that you'd want to know who's they were. It is possible they are a boyfriend's, or maybe she is exploring her gender identity, or maybe she's just letting anyone throw stuff in for your free laundry service. Whatever it is, if she wants privacy, then she can do her own washing. Don't push her about whose they were or anything, clearly she doesn't want to share. \n\nOnce again, teach her how to do her own laundry.", "NTA. You might want to stop doing her laundry.

I knew how to do laundry and other chores around 6 years old and did it on my own. It's really not that hard to do your own laundry and do adult responsibilities. Her being 18 its past time for her to learn. Does she expect a future spouse to take care of the household duties themselves while she is lazy and does nothing to help out? That could destroy any potential relationship she could have.

I don't think she didn't want me to, she just did because she did the laundry and it was easier than explaining.\n\nMy kids have been doing their own laundry since they were about ten.", "OPs going to get whacked by Big Laundry for stealing customers.", "My laundry room at college was pretty good and people were good about not moving other's stuff most of the time, but I still took laundry home on breaks to save myself money \ud83d\ude05. I would usually wash my bedding before I went home so I came back to a clean bed, but I took all the clothes with me.", "Luckily I started doing my laundry when I got my first period but there were some basic life skills my parents took care of for me until the day I moved out and it wasn't a kindness. Good on you for teaching him solid habits early.", "This is true else female orientated boy boxes wouldn\u2019t be a thing", "Very true, but the jump from \u201cshe told me that there would probably other people\u2019s things in this laundry\u201d to \u201cstay out of my business\u201d is jarring with no connecting events.", "Him asking her about the clothes is not \u201ccontrolling\u201d behavior? What is he trying to control? At best it is nosey; at worst it was a misplaced question because it is not his business. \n\nMy vote is ESH.", "For pete sakes.  People do not live in bubbles.  Who TF cares if someone asks if they are dating?  If you don't want to answer, fine, but it's a fairly normal question FFS.", "No, they don't. People can wear whatever the fuck they want.", "Truth hurts....", "I just deleted the comment cause I re-read and thought about it, and agree its weird he\u2019s doing her laundry in the first place. But he said he didn\u2019t mind. \n\nShe should def be doing her own laundry in the first place, but also cmon if my step dad asked if I had a boyfriend cause he saw mens underwear in my laundry id be kinda weirded out. I also own boxers cause they comfy that doesnt mean anything", "Seriously. Maybe I wouldn't use that language but fully agree with sentiment. If you're close enough with someone that they do your dirty laundry for you on a regular basis, I'd assume the relationship is close enough that they can ask about a potential relationship. He's not her maid. \n\nIf she'd come home to do the laundry *herself* and he'd been going through her things, one hundred percent that would have been on him.", "[deleted]", "Male underwear.  Silly to raise re 18YO", "It's an expression not meant to be taken literally. Read much?", "And evidently, a lot of other people's too.", "Or as a man. I remember quite a few occasions where my now-husband, then friend, convinced girls who lived on our dorm floor to do his laundry under the guise of not knowing how.", "Yep and then get upset", "I sometimes take my bedding and towels to do at my parents\u2019, and I\u2019ve had my own place for 15 years.  \nThey have a tumble dryer, I don\u2019t, and line dried towels are not as soft and fluffy as tumble dried", "That detail right there is what makes me think that step daughter is hiding something and that mom might be in on it but for some reason OP isn't.  There was nothing about the description of events that makes me even think that he was being intrusive at all beyond a surface level of curiosity (and really, what reasonable person wouldn't be at least mildly curious about finding unexpected undergarments in their child's laundry).  So unless OP has omitted some other personal details about his relationship with step daughter or he holds a worldview that might be damaging to her (assuming as others have suggested that she might be non-binary or trans and is exploring her identity), there's really no justifiable reason in my mind for such an extreme reaction.", "\"Nosey\" happens when the person doesn't literally ask you to touch, untie, sort, clean, untie again, hang out, pick up, and fold every single item of their underwear.", "But I think you\u2019d have to admit that such a question is not tied to finding someone\u2019s underwear. There was probably some level of embarrassment on her part that she may not have had if she were asked under different circumstances.", "Yes, they can but garments tend to be cut differently for people with/without penises, breasts, broad shoulders, etc. Women may certainly wear tighty whities but there will be more room and an opening in front to accommodate a dick.", "Except undergarments are actually made for the parts that are using them...  whether or not genders or non genders wear them for any other purpose.", "The fact that I can wear summer shoes in winter doesn't mean there's no such thing as summer shoes.\n\nThe fact I can wear flipflops to a hike doesn't mean they are not beachwear.\n\nThe fact I can physically wear panties doesn't make panties aren't female underwear.", "In a perfect world you are absolutely correct. Unfortunately that\u2019s not where we are yet. There are clothes intended for men and clothes intended for women. \n\nNobody can stop you from wearing one or the other, and you\u2019re well within your right to do so, but to claim that there is no gendered clothing is disingenuous", "Dude, if step dad SAW my dirty laundry I'd be uncomfortable about it. \n\nBut that goes out of the window when I refuse to do my own laundry and hand him weeks of laundry to do.", "OP is way, WAAAAY milder than I am.", "it was just a question though?", "That\u2019s kinda weird, isn\u2019t it? I would understand if she took her friends\u2019 laundry home and washed it herself but handing her dad a bunch of other people\u2019s underwear and expecting him to sort it and clean it etc is really\u2026 wrong.", "Not quite sure why youre being upvoted for saying a man convinced women to do things for them by pretending to not know how, but I'm being down voted for switching the sexes lol", "If you are that delicate that the question is mortifying...maybe sort through your laundry and pull out everyone else's!  \n\nUnless you are a family... why are there assorted people sharing the same laundry basket?  Honestly, that in itself is bizarre and worth questioning.  If you don't want questions, learn to cover your tracks.", "Not as much disingenuous as wishful thinking.\n\nAlso, why would that be a perfect world? It's fine if there are clothes for men and clothes for women, as long as it's not a compulsory thing.", "I totally agree, but why didnt he just say no. Shes gonna keep bringing home dirty laundry as long as he keeps saying \u201cyoung people dont know how to do this properly\u201d like let her be an adult \n\nThis entire dynamic is weirdly in eachothers business and dependent", "Yes, and then to get so bent out of shape when asked about it. The other girls he might not even have noticed unless bras or other things were a lot different in size.", "But they're not wrong. I have no need for underwear with a pouch - it's not intended for me. This doesn't mean I can't wear it.", "The word perfect is subjective. Thats why", "He didn't because he's being helpful. But the price of people and not businesses helping you is that people can ask questions. \n\nIf I don't want anyone knowing where I'm going, I'll pay for a taxi. If I ask someone in my family to drive me, they will ask \"where?\"\n\nIf after asking they say \"where're you going\", I certainly can say \"I'd rather not talk about it, sorry and thanks for bringing me\", but I can't say \"FUCK YOU GET OUT OF MY LIFE STOP BEING CONTROLLING\".\n\nDaughter could have said \"I'd rather not talk about it\", she had a right to that. That wasn't the case though.", "Sounds like massive weaponized incompetence on the girl\u2019s side and OP spoiling his daughter. She told her dad how well he does the laundry as some weird compliment to dump it all on him and he\u2019s happy to comply because in his world all young people are crap at washing their damn clothes.", "But adjectives don't necessarily mean \"can't\". You CAN wear beachwear for a mountain hike. \n\n\"Winter clothes\" doesn't mean you can't wear them in summer, it means that most people do wear them in summer.\n\nDescriptors don't need to fit 100% of the cases to be valid and useful. You can say \"Dogs walk in four legs\", and it doesn't mean there aren't three legged dogs, or that it's illegal for a dog to learn to walk in two legs.", "Sounds like good teaching moment.  This is how it's done.", "Let's be real, most young people *are* crap at washing their own clothes. I was too, when I first moved out on my own.\n\nBut I don't understand how OP thinks that makes it his responsibility to do her laundry. She's home for a visit, I'm assuming she's not working or studying. She can do it herself.", "Did you not read what I wrote? I said you can wear them. \n\nThese are two points. \n\n1. You can wear whatever you want.\n2. It wasn't intended for this person/purpose.\n\nTwo things can be right at the same time.", "Exactly", "I think we're two people that agree and are arguing the same point. Heh", "Probably, lol.
