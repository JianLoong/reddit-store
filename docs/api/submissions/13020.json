She brings home her laundry and has you do it, who's the one making \"demands\" here?\n\nI think you should kindly, nicely, and gently tell her that perhaps she should do her own laundry, as you don't want any misunderstandings or arguments, and you love her too much to argue over laundry when she can maintain her privacy by simply doing it herself (or paying to have it sent out).\n\nYour wife should have suggested this as well. IN my mind, you have someone doing your cleaning/washing for you as a favor - there aren't expectations of privacy.", "NTA. She expects you to wash, dry, and fold laundry but not ask questions? That's crazy.\n\nYour next question should be, \"Why did me asking a question about the laundry you had me wash and fold upset you so much?\" She told you that some items belonging to female friends would be included in the laundry she tasked you with washing. She didn't mention male items. So it seems natural to ask a question or two.\n\nPerhaps she has a female, nonbinary, or trans significant other. That might explain why she got upset at being asked about maybe having a boyfriend.", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, your stepdaughter should be doing her own laundry. She's in college now, your logic about \"not being good at the stuff\" applies to twelve years olds. I think if I'd taken home piles and piles of unwashed laundry when I was a freshman my parents would have laughed me out the door. You should say she can come home to do laundry and use your machines, and you'll show her how to do it the first few times. I know that wasn't your question but... seriously. Also, the thought of my parents touching my used unmentionables is... uncomfortable to say the least. \n\nSecond, if she had just been doing laundry at home and you went through her laundry or something, maybe her reaction would have been justified. She's asking you to wash undergarments, it's perfectly reasonable that you'd want to know who's they were. It is possible they are a boyfriend's, or maybe she is exploring her gender identity, or maybe she's just letting anyone throw stuff in for your free laundry service. Whatever it is, if she wants privacy, then she can do her own washing. Don't push her about whose they were or anything, clearly she doesn't want to share. \n\nOnce again, teach her how to do her own laundry.", "NTA. You might want to stop doing her laundry.

I knew how to do laundry and other chores around 6 years old and did it on my own. It's really not that hard to do your own laundry and do adult responsibilities. Her being 18 its past time for her to learn. Does she expect a future spouse to take care of the household duties themselves while she is lazy and does nothing to help out?
