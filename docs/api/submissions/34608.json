However I paid for and organised everything, my brother didn't even come see my dad when he was dying. He kept making up excuses about work even when my dad was begging him. I didn't say anything to him because o figured everyone grieves differently.\n\nSince dad died, all my brother has done is talk about him and how much he misses him which is fine. But my dad was my best friend, I lived with him and took care of him, my brother rarely visited. We have a mother who moved back to the country and the house I'm in now when he got sick.\n\nShe's a horrible woman but I let her live here because it's just easier.\n\nAnyway, with the wedding, they picked her two sisters as bridesmaids and three of his friends as groomsmen. All of her family, parents, nephews etc have a role to play. My mother has been included with readings, lighting candles, and part of the bridal package so all her room, hair, makeup etc is included.\n\nMy invitation was as my mother's plus one. I got a text a few months ago that said I could come but need to try and sort my own accommodation, a bit weird but okay.\n\nJust before Christmas they told my mother they had a surprise for me for the wedding, I thought maybe a bridesmaid? No, it's a candle. They will light a candle for my dad, for me and the service.\n\nI haven't said or let on about my sadness over this whole thing become apparent at all. And last night I got a text that said \"Hey, you're the only one not doing anything for this wedding, want to do a reading or something so you don't look left out?\", I politely declined, fear of public speaking.\n\nI just don't get it, I have always tried ny best to be in my brothers life, and my niece's life but I rarely see her. When you visit its like they have better things to do but they love the expensive presents I buy.\n\nI don't get why my horribly abusive mother who abandoned us when we were teenagers and who tried to have my dying father arrested is being included and I'm being left out.\n\nI guess I'm asking, would I be the asshole if i didn't attend?

Your brother has obviously realised he's left you out and has offered a reading to fix that, but the fact that you aren't even invited except as your mother's plus one is bizarre and you should absolutely have asked what that was about. I would notify them that you're not attending as you haven't actually been invited and you're taking a step back from one-sided relationships.\n\nThey've clearly shown that you are superfluous to their life. So, I recommend you drop the rope. If it's your house, you should tell your mother to move out. Stop buying overly expensive gifts for your niece: put money in a bank account that you can sign over to them later in life if you want to.\n\nMost importantly, stop being quiet all the time. You've let everyone treat you poorly and not said a word. Please stop doing that. You're not a martyr, or a doormat. Stand up for yourself for once.", "INFO: Have you ever asked your brother, why you weren't included and didn't even get your own invitation but just your mothers +1? \n\nThe question if you want to do anything at the wedding also seems strange.

Use his reaction as the deciding factor in whether or not you go to the wedding,\n\nIf you\u2019re worried he\u2019ll take it badly if you try and talk to him, remember he\u2019ll also take it badly if you don\u2019t go to the wedding so really it better to just be upfront", "NTA\n\nPersonal advice - take or leave, as I'm just some reddit Rando to you - get your mother out of your house, stop buying expensive presents and work on building a found family. Your blood family does not support you, is not recognising your needs and is using you. Don't financially support any of them, whatever you do, or you may spend the rest of your life stuck looking after people who are just abusing your kindness.\n\nI wish you all the happiness in the world OP, and condolences for your father.", "NTA but I will admit I have some skepticism, as this sounds very one sided and I just don\u2019t see how your father\u2019s passing(sorry for your loss) has anything to really do with the wedding. Just kind of seems like we aren\u2019t getting the full story here, but random background to make your brother and mom look worse.\n\nIt sounds like you two don\u2019t have the connection that you have hoped. Rather than pretend to be sick (which I think no one will believe) you should actually just question him or go little/no contact.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you're only being invited to not look bad, but otherwise they don't really care if you attend.", "Nta", "NTA \n\nHe didn\u2019t even send you your own invitation, it\u2019s like you are an afterthought, so in my eyes you owe him nothing\n\nHad it been me I would have written him a letter explaining why you decide not to attend the wedding\n\nEdit: misspelling", "NAH - this is all very one sided though. If you dont want to go, dont. That\u2019s your choice. But it doesnt sound like your brother feels any sort of connection with you, so he\u2019s not an AH for that necessarily.", "YWNBTA. But... is this what you really want? I mean, you aren't in the wrong for not going. But this kind of thing has a way of defining a relationship. If you don't care that this might be the last interaction you have with your brother or any potential nieces and nephews, there's really no harm. But if you do want a relationship with your brother and you are hoping to have a better relationship with him someday, going to this wedding would make that a lot easier.   \n\n\nthe not-an-asshole thing is largely because you weren't even invited. That's just weird. Your brother is right, it looks super weird that everyone but you has a role, but that's HIS weird, not your's. He's the one who will be drawing questions.   \n\n\nI'm guessing there is more to this story. And OP - I'm guessing that there is some a$$holery that you haven't talked about in the past. Just food for though. Just because not going won't make you an a$$hole doesn't mean that there's no a$$hole nature in the past here.", "No I don't blame you. I wouldn't go either if I was you.

At one point, he actually bit himself and blamed it on me. He was always getting me into trouble and then he got old enough to lie! That was a real problem, because our parents liked to set punishments that lasted until one of us confessed, so I ended up lying that I \\*had\\*  done the wrong thing, just to get out of their punishment.
