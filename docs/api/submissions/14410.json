We went on our first date ever together, he was great, then two days later my dad told us we had to move again. This isn't all about a teen crush, it was just another bad thing.\n\nthe issue is my parents and siblings (18F, 16M) act like it was objectively great. They say it taught them to accept change and make friends quickly, me? I gave up on friends and was living out of a duffle bag by 15.

Just because your feelings on it don't line up with what theirs do doesn't make yours wrong. \n\nI guess he must have glossed over every Commander's Call (or whatever they would be referred to in the Army, I served in a different branch), where (in my experience) the commander typically would remind his folks to thank their families when they left the briefing, that families are the unsung/unseen heroes of the military, and that they make many sacrifices on their end that are simply overlooked because they're not wearing the uniform. Sure, some of that is absolutely \"feel good\" commander speak, but that doesn't invalidate the actual message behind it. \n\nDid you \"serve?\" No. But did you make sacrifices? Absolutely, and there are many who served/are serving that would attest to that.", "NTA   \n\n\nYou did sacrifice a lot. Your experience is different from your siblings because you are a different person. It's hard settling into new places and if you're not going to stay anywhere long I can imagine not wanting to try and build new relationships every time. It's taken its toll on you. People tend to want lasting relationships, even with 'just' friends. Honestly it sounds exhausting  \n\n\nI'm glad you've moved to college and hopefully you won't have to move around without your own say so anymore. Besides, you are entitled to *your* feelings. No matter what someone else might think about those. Of course they are also entitled to theirs, but that doesn't make yours any less valid.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't sacrifice like your father, but you DID sacrifice a large portion of your childhood.

Sure you can call home anywhere but just because you grew up with that doesn\u2019t mean the people you want serious relationships want that. A good question for your siblings is: do they think their significant others should sacrifice their lives for your siblings careers (if it involves constant travel)?", "NTA. It sucks when you can't put roots down, especially because of others decisions. \n\nMost of my teen years I couch surfed a lot. So while I never had to go to a new school I never stayed in one place for long. It made things hard because I couldn't have friends over because I didn't always know where I would end up that night and when I got older and got a place of my own I had anxiety that it was going to be taken from me. I even slept on the couch a lot because that's what I was used to despite having a bed.", "NTA for sure. Your family is coping with the chaos, disruption, and interrupted relationships of military moves by looking at the positives. I'm not sure this is a healthy way of coping with all of this but there were some positives, at least for them. They are going to cling to this point of view because they have to. This is how they are coping with their trauma. They are doing the best they can to cope and they NEED to cope. Everyone needs to cope. When you express an alternate point of view, it threatens their coping. You cannot look to your family for validation of your experience. I'm sorry. It's hard to not be seen. I hope you can find therapist and/or a group of people with whom to process your experiences and their consequences.  I looked online and there are a number of scholarly studies on the effects of military life on children of active duty service members. Clearly this is a thing!  Whether or not your family can or will except that such a lifestyle is a challenge, the fact that there are multiple studies makes clear that it absolutely is a challenge for many, many people. Consider yourself validated - at least with as much validation as my online self can provide!\n\nHere are some links to studies. I gave them only a cursory read so I'm not endorsing them.

I was lucky to have a dad that went Reserves when I was young and grow up in one place, but there were still some disruptive elements because of the military. Moves, while expected, are disruptive to your ability to feel settled. If you happen to be an introvert it can be even harder. And everyone reacts to change differently. They asked your opinion and didn't get the response they expected. They need to now accept that it wasn't a perfect life as they remember it and that it did create issues for you.", "NTA\n\nI was an Army brat. It took me decades to figure out how to be friends with someone for more than two years. Because growing up, we moved every year or two and I had to make all new friends.\n\nTo some extent, your parents don\u2019t want to hear that military life affected you badly. That reflects on them as parents and it makes them feel bad.\n\nBut I think they need to hear it.\n\nYou can acknowledge the benefits of military life\u2014learning to make friends easily, travel and exposure to different cultures, exposure to different ways of thinking\u2014while at the same time acknowledging the downsides\u2014no long term friendships, no roots, the utter inability to answer the question, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d without having to clarify, \u201cDo you mean where I just moved from or where I was born or someplace in between?\u201d\n\nAs an introvert, I\u2019m pretty sure I would have done better living in one place and having a steady group of friends over a long period of time. By the time I was 10 or 11, I didn\u2019t try hard to make friends because we were just going to move again, I was going to be forced into a new group of strangers again, a new school again, a new Girl Scout troop again. \n\nAnd my parents worried that I spent all my time in my room reading. It was a lot safer than constantly putting myself on the line trying to make friends and then having someone be mean to me.\n\nI was not allowed to do anything to my room. We were going to move again so there was no point in spending money to make the room look nice. I had to pick a bedspread that could work with any color of walls because heaven forbid we try to coordinate with the paint color. Don\u2019t even think of painting\u2014we\u2019re moving in two years! Nothing on the walls so we could pass inspection when we moved out. No curtains because they would not fit the windows in whatever new house we moved to. When every other teen or pre-teen in the US was taping posters to their walls, I had to worry about my bookcase making a mark on the wall that could cause problems when we moved out.\n\nI hear you, OP. Military families do make sacrifices. My oldest brother went to a different  high school every year. I went to three different high schools. That can affect your education. I did not attend a single prom. Back then, you had to go as a couple and no one knew me well enough to ask me.\n\nI was bullied for talking \u201cfunny.\u201d The Boston accent I got from my parents sounded odd in Pittsburgh and the South. \n\nI didn\u2019t know local customs and got laughed at for that. I hated going to local schools because of that and loved it when there was a school on base.\n\nThere were benefits to military life. But it messed up my relationships for years and years. It probably made me more introverted than I would have been. I still, 40 years on, don\u2019t have a good answer to \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d", "NTA\nKids need a place that they can call home. And making friends is one thing, losing them all the time is another. Your parents chose this life, you didn't.

Not only were you treated badly, you're now expected to lie so that they feel better about it.", "Your feelings are entirely valid \n\nI moved my kids around quite a bit due to my mental health , lack of support and other reasons when they were young and to this day I\u2019m so fucking sorry for it \n\nI know the situations aren\u2019t the same because the reasons are different but it equates to the same thing .. kids need stability and the ability to be able to develop and grow relationships throughout their childhood and those things aren\u2019t there if you\u2019re moved around a lot \n\nIt\u2019s great for them that your siblings seem to have been able to cope with it better than you but that doesn\u2019t make how YOU feel any less valid at all and being honest with everyone about how you feel is the right thing to do \n\nNTA", "NTA. You're absolutely right, and I have to say, nobody considers the families of military personnel and their feelings. The fact is, military personnel do cause their kids to have mostly absent parents, instability due to moving often and anxieties due to the safety risks that job brings. Whilst there are many military heroes out there who have fought for their countries who deserve hero status... it doesn't change the fact that their kids never chose that life and are likely to be negatively impacted. You are entitled to tell your family how you feel, and not be invalidated. I wish you a happy, secure and permanent home going forward, with the stability you need.", "NTA. Your feelings; the desire for stability and meaningful connections are relatable and understandable. Although you didn't \"sacrifice\" like your dad did, you still gave up a great deal for your country, more than the average individual. Your sense of community and belonging; your deep emotional connections to individuals, were your sacrifice.", "NTA. I did 24 years in the Army, we were dual military for awhile. We were able to settle down when our oldest was in 4th grade and twins were in first grade. Moving is hard, I didn't like it. My Wife was an Air Force Brat, she was always ready to move. That carried over into her career where she would get restless, job hop, and wear out her welcome in a place.", "I'm sorry they invalidated your experience like that. I had a similar experience myself, in terms of unfortunate childhood scenarios that everyone around me seemed just hunky dory about. It can be really alienating.   \n\n\nRemember that your perspective is valid, and fair, and you don't have any reason to beat yourself up about it.   \n\n\nFeel free to send me a DM if you need someone to talk to.", "Your situation is exactly why I left active duty and joined the reserves. I wanted kids, but did not want them to be uprooted constantly. NTA and definitely seek therapy, soon you'll be able to plant yourself somewhere. Good luck and I do appreciate your sacrifices, I'm just sorry it hurt so much.", "NTA.  I was a military brat, too, and I felt the exact same way.  I still have difficulties making close friends.  My siblings loved moving all of the time, but I struggled making friends, struggled keeping my grades up, struggled fitting in, and after a while I just retreated and stopped trying.  So - I really feel for you, OP.  You\u2019re not wrong to feel that way, there are lots of military brats that feel like us. The trick is to find ways to create your own sense of community.  Volunteering helps if you have time for it.", "NTA, I know plenty of veterans who act like they sacrificed for their country and family without accepting that their family suffered as a result. Failed marriages are because the spouse wasn't supportive enough, children with behavior issues are because they were looking for attention and not beaten enough... \n\nMeanwhile what war in our generation has been about protecting America? The military is just a job or career, it isn't some sacred calling. Leaving the service to do right by your family needs to be looked on more favorably.", "I'm super confused. I was also a military brat that moved alot as a kid. The things OP is dicussing were commonly talked about \"collateral damage\" of having a military parent that other adults would talk about all the time. The extra steps you had to take to help your children feel secure moving so often, a working military spouse having to find new jobs, everyone getting new friends, etc. These were discussed so often it was a bonding experience at parties. Hell, the uncertainty of these situations is an actual trope in movies and books.\n\nIt sounds like OPs parents are in denial about how they failed their child and are taking out their feelings on said on OP when it's being brought to their attention. \n\nNTA", "NTA you didn\u2019t sacrifice no.
