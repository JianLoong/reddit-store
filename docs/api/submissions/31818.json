One is my stepdad, though he still raised me and I consider him just my dad Ill call him stepdad for this, and the other is my bio dad who is also transgender. My dad passes and he doesn\u2019t tell people about it because it really isn\u2019t their business for most people, but never been scared to tell people if they somehow asked about it in any way. But he gave birth to me and since has had my younger brother with my stepdad. \n\nEveryone at school knows that knows me knows about me having two dads and even though I gotten teased before, it\u2019s never been a huge deal. The issue is with my boyfriend (18m). We been dating for a year and we been friends since the start of high school. He has known since the beginning of me having two dads and never had a problem before, but when he came over he saw my dad looking through my baby book and my dad invited him since he will always take a chance to show me off (embarrass me) and at first it was all cute and wholesome, but then my boyfriend asked my dad about my mom which was awkward but my dad told him straight up that he was the one he gave birth to me and he is technically my mom. My boyfriend was just like \u201coh\u201d and was pretty quiet for the rest of it around my dad, but when we went to my room he got mad at me for lying to him about my parents and birth. We argued since I didn\u2019t think it was important that my dad is trans and asked why it was even an issue. He just avoided answering me and soon we got loud and I told him to leave. He did and I just felt like crying, my dad heard us and came to me and comforted me. I can tell he feels bad, but he hasn\u2019t said anything much. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, but when I talked to my friends most of them said I was in the wrong. I don\u2019t even get what he is mad about in the first place. He hasn\u2019t talked to me since and it\u2019s been three days, we normally met up in a specific spot together before school, but he wasn\u2019t there and he hasn\u2019t talked to me in our shared classes. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for here, but I guess another perspective on it, maybe some insight? I\u2019m not sure, but was I wrong?\n\nEdit: Thank you for your replies, it made me feel better that I wasn\u2019t crazy for it. I said it in a reply, but I\u2019m planning to talk to him tomorrow at school. Let\u2019s hope for the best.

No person with cis parents tells anyone they date intimate stuff about their parents' personal lives and bodies, like how long their mom nursed them or how many moles their dad has on his butts. Bf is giving off transphobic vibes and if he continues to make a big deal of this, then be glad you found out who he is early enough.", "NTA-I'm an old lady, so please forgive if I sound offensive, I truly have no ill-intent.  I can't for the life of me understand what your bf can possibly be mad about.  Even if he assumed that your dads are a traditional same sex couple (that phrase alone makes me \ud83d\ude03), then he should have some clue that there had to be a person who birthed you.  Sounds like your school's biology curriculum is lacking.", "NTA. You have parents. They're your parents. We don't tell our high school partners everything about our parents because (IMO) that would be weird. You were right to respect your dads' privacy.", "How is he even saying you lied?  It sounds like the first time the subject came up, he got told the whole story.", "NTA.  He's arguing with you about someone else; your bf needs to grow up.  He may feel embarrassed having led the conversation down an awkward path that would have been avoidable with more information -but that's not the end of the world. Hopefully he'll process some small embarrassment and allow things to go back to how they were.", "NTA. Cis people constantly assume trans people are cis and then get mad at us, or in this case, our family members for \"lying\" or \"deceiving\" when we truly were not trying to hide anything, they just got in trouble with their own assumptions. Like your Dad was, I am a pregnant trans man. I cannot tell you the number of times I explicitly say \"I am pregnant,\" \"My back hurts,\" \"I've been throwing up, etc.\" and people still continue to assume that I am talking about my wife.", "NTA. Its understandable that he is suprised and didnt know how to react. The full argument later does sound a bit like he does have issues with trans people.", "Examples of lies of omission that matter long term:  your martial status, your criminal record, the existence of children.  Things that in some substantial way can affect the other if the relationship becomes serious enough to intermingle households, make long-term plans together, etc.  \n\nExamples of things that absolutely don't matter to him or his future if he stays with you:  the status of your parent's genitalia during birth.  \n\nNTA - I might give him a chance to explain himself if there is something else going on here, but I highly doubt it.  Find a partner that doesn't care about your Dad's penis or lack there of any more than you do!  (Not to diminish your Dad's journey, of course.)", "NTA for not telling him, but my guess is that he was more angry because he caused an embarrassing moment by asking about the bio mother when it was your dad all along. He was probably worried about your dad's perspective of him, bc he's your boyfriend, and he wants acceptance from your dads. Just give him some space to process it but let him know you're eager to talk when he's ready.", "Nta-they had preconceived notions that you didn\u2019t put there. It shouldn\u2019t make a difference to him one way or another. Now he knows the story from another angle.", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong and you didn't lie. It wasn't brought up and it shouldn't matter to your bf. The narrative however,  him and your friends are turning it against you. Which you shouldn't listen and be bothered with. I hope you and your dads are feeling better.", "NTA. The way you were birthed doesn't really matter. It doesn't affect who you are as a person. I know you and your boyfriend are still young, but he is behaving incredibly immature by ignoring you. Now is the time to work out what you are worth. You don't need to put up with being ignored by your partner who should be communicating their issue with you.", "NTA he made a dumb and poor assumption and is probably transphobic", "NTA it's none of his business. Your dad is your dad regardless of whether he gave birth to you or not. Might wanna reflect on if he's shown transphobic tendencies or not.", "NTA. From what I understand, this was the first time it came up so you told him everything. I'm not sure where you could've lied so you didn't do anything wrong, and I'm not sure why your friends are telling you that you did. \n\nAs you said in your original post, this information isn't other people's business and whether dad chooses to share this is his decision. No one is entitled to this information nor are they entitled to get upset because they didn't, whether it is random people, or your boyfriend. The only person who can make this decision is the person themselves or anyone that said person allows. Your dad is your dad, and that's all that matters (your parents sound sweet btw). \n\nFeeling entitled and betrayed feels kinda gross though and giving you the cold shoulder for a few days is kinda concerning to me though. Like he got upset because he didn't get told about your dad's identity. Like genuinely why does that matter because he's dating you, not your dad. Why does he care about how you were born. Also with a reaction like that, wouldn't someone want to clarify what they meant.  \n\nI  don't know your boyfriend personally so I don't know how he usually acts and i don't wish to assume  but talking to him about the situation is your best bet, even if he's making it hard. Let him make himself known how he feels because it's best to find this out soon, as much as it's sad. If anything it'll be his loss. \n\nI wish you all luck though. I hope what I said makes sense.", "was he upset because he felt embarrassed that he asked your dad about your mom and then it turned out your dad was your mom? because i probably wouldve been embarrassed if i made that mistake and wouldve definitely been kinda like \u201cwhy didnt you tell me im so embarrassed?!\u201d but other than that it sounds like hes overreacting, nta either way", "NTA\n\nBeing gay is vastly different than being transgender. Your BF got caught off guard and probably didn\u2019t know how to handle this new information in the moment. It was sprung on him and he reacted poorly, probably because he was embarrassed and uncomfortable.\n\nBe a little understanding, but don\u2019t let yourself feel like crap over this! This is not your fault, and it is not your responsibility to explain your father\u2019s life choices to anyone.\n\nHow you move forward is more important. If it\u2019s too weird for your bf then move on. \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t lie, you just didn\u2019t provide him with extra information you didn\u2019t think was necessary and understandably so, your Dad is your Dad!\n\nBut I can understand your boyfriend (of a year, too) feeling mightily embarrassed asking your Dad about who your Mom is, when he was speaking to him the whole time.\nI\u2019d have probably been a bit miffed that my partner let me walk into that, just because any kind of awkward situation with in-laws or partners parents can be mortifying", "NTA - first, it\u2019s literally none of his damn business about how you were brought into being. Second, that\u2019s a massive red flag with him giving you silent treatment and avoiding you entirely. He\u2019s angry over information that wasn\u2019t necessary for him to know to care for and love you.", "NTA. Don\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t lie to your boyfriend. He was just overreacting. We don\u2019t get to tell someone about our life unless we are asked to.", "NTA. It isn't your boyfriend's business the status of your parents. The personal history of your parents is theirs to reveal as they want. Just because your BF is dating you does not mean that your family's entire history should be an open book to him, and he is not entitled to every piece of information about your family.\n\nKeep something in mind: *you did nothing wrong!* Your boyfriend is the one who is reacting badly, and your friends are mistaken when they said that you did something wrong. It is not your BF's business who gave birth to you, who are your biological parents are, if you are adopted, or even if you are a clone of one of your parents. And he needs to get over himself and understand this.\n\nHe also needs to understand that there *will* be a time, in any relationship, that information like this will be revealed for the first time - it's not like you will download your entire family history the first time you meet, or even on your first date. In short, your BF needs to grow up and realize that he is not the center of the universe. And that is the polite interpretation - the less charitable one that he is just plain transphobic and reacting badly because of that.", "You\u2019ve been together a year and never talked about what happened to your birth mother or where she is??", "Your BF was blindsided by the information and had to react in the moment rather than knowing already. \n\nIn that moment that your dad told him, try to think about what was going through his mind. \n\n\"Ok, I didn't know that... Why didn't my girlfriend tell me? Oh damn, I'm being quiet all of a sudden. Do they think I'm against it? I really don't want to seem against it, why didn't she tell me?\"\n\nSure it's none of his business.

She really went off her rocker and fell for the Trace Adkins scam and spent 5k on it, she'd get pissed when FIL tried to talk to her about and when she saw the articles where Trace Adkins said he was happily married and those were fake accounts and to please not fall for them. They ended up divorced after 20 some years. Last I heard she still thought Trace was gonna come pick her up in a helicopter! I hope she gets the help she needs as she's moved back to family.

Or didn\u2019t think it\u2019s important.\n\nI\u2019m only asking as I had a date with a guy and he told me that his mom was trans and he said it with such pride. He was older than you and it was a good talking point. And as others has said it rules out any transphobia before you get too attached.", "NTA and it definitely isn\u2019t ok he got angry. But maybe he got rather surprised. So many people don\u2019t think about what they label normal. It was likely \u201cnormal\u201d you had 2 dads with no consideration for how that could occur. It\u2019s possible he can wrap his mind around it and move on. It\u2019s true no one but oneself is responsible for what they learn and grow from. That you don\u2019t HAVE to help someone like that learn better. But if no one stepped beyond that, the civil rights movement would never have happened. If he\u2019s not open to learning certainly don\u2019t waste the effort. I never interacted with someone who couldn\u2019t pass as white til I was 23 and about the same for someone not strictly heterosexual. So I can understand having an experience that smashes your idea of normal. Again don\u2019t waste effort on someone refusing to change, but if f he\u2019s open to understanding and expanding his view, it\u2019s a shame to pass that opportunity up.", "Nta. You didn\u2019t lie. It\u2019s your family\u2019s information and your dad was able to share it when he felt ready.", "NTA. im guessing hes more embarrassed and wishes u told him so he could\u2019ve avoided the embarrassment?", "NTA.\n\nWhy he mad? I don't see any point from him to be mad at you... Lying? He should be proud at you for respecting your parents choice. And 18 yrs old.. jesus what kind of 18 do commitment?", "NTA. Honestly you did nothing wrong and neither you or your dad have to explain ur situation to anyone. It\u2019s not his business, if he gets mad it\u2019s completely his problem.", "NTA\n\nYour parent is your parent, and you never hid that or lied about it.  Were you supposed to \"Warn\" people you meet about your Dad being trans? I'd personally be more likely to warn someone that my dad is something negative like -  he picks his nose in public, or likes to interrogate your friends about their grades.  Your Dad's trans-ness is your Dad's business.  The good news is that your boyfriend knows now, and he can hopefully reflect on why he feels so upset by this revelation.  How does this knowledge threaten his current worldview?  Can he move on in your relationship in a healthy way?  What if there are other people he knows now or meets in the future who are trans?  How will he react?  \n\nI really wish you the best in your talk with your boyfriend.  Because I am an optimist I am hoping this can be an opportunity for his personal growth.  Just know that however your conversation goes that you did nothing wrong, and that he learned about your Dad's transness from the right person...your Dad!", "NTA \nI don't point at my cis mom either and introduce her like \"This is my mom, she birthed me herself. Want to see pictures as proof?\" it's ridiculous, just like it doesn't need any elaboration for cis people, your history should not be owed to anyone by default just because your dad is trans.", "NTA - it\u2019s not a big deal, and you need new friends if they think you were wrong for this.\n\nAnd a new bf because this one ain\u2019t worth the time.", "NTA\n\nHe shouldn't be angry at you because of which parent happened to give birth to you. That information shouldn't matter.", "The answer is that to him and possibly your friends, that MIGHT have been a deal breaker had they known the person they were dating had a trans parent from the beginning. Yeah, people might ACT like they're super Liberal and accepting but only from a safe distance. Watch that tolerance crumble when it directly impacts them, their reputation, their coolness. They are assholes. You are correct, and it should not make one bit of difference. So the fact that it's this much of an issue tells you all you need to know. Stop chasing after this silly boy and find someone worthy of you.", "But why did you lie to him though?", "Maybe no one is the AH. Your boyfriend was probably a bit shocked and would have liked a heads up before sitting down and getting blind sided. This does not mean he is transphobic, as I doubt he was scared. People have the right to believe in science and biology without having your phobic screamed at them. Stop being sciencephobic. Your mom pretends to be a guy and your real dad isn\u2019t around. New guy steps in that is a non science person. It\u2019s your life, live it how you want, but stop expecting everyone else to play along and act like it\u2019s normal.", "YTA - but a very small one.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be angry at my girlfriend for not telling me, but I would be disappointed.\n\nThat\u2019s a blunder that could have easily Been avoided.", "He was caught off guard and he didn't like that. \n\nNAH", "Maybe say biological mother instead of bio dad because then it makes sense?", "Why do I feel your bf would tell a different version", "NTA Your friends are all wrong", "NTA- You dodged a bullet if he doesn't apologize, anyone who knows anything about/is supportive of the trans community knows that trans men can get pregnant and your bfs reaction makes me suspect he's a bit transphobic.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't call your ex transphobic, per se.\n\nHis reaction was out of line though.\n\nI can understand that he was caught off-guard.\n\nHe assumed you had 2 dads and came into their family through adoption, surrogacy or a previous relationship.\n\nTo then be told one of your dad's carried you and not being aware of that could have been embarrassing.\n\nFor quite a few people i can see their brain short-circuiting when a becomes pregnant.\n\nHad your ex simply asked questions that would have been ok, but to become mad/angry isn't a good sign.", "NTA. He\u2019s mad because he is either full of hate or full of fear. If he\u2019s scared, he needs to get over himself, and if he\u2019s full of hate, then to hell with him. That turd isn\u2019t worthy of you anyways.", "NTA, not his business to know", "NTA. Your bf is weird that he thinks it\u2019s an issue.", "Nta. Your boyfriend is transphobic, that's why he exploded about it.", "NTA at all. Your boyfriend's discomfort isn't on you - he's probably embarrassed by his own assumption/mistake and is taking it out on you, unfairly. I imagine his ego is bruised.", "It's literally none of his business, NTA", "NTA Your bf probably has a prophecy about him that says he can't be killed  by anyone \"of woman born\" and is freaking out about your familly history because of it, but its not your responsibility to deal with his hangups.\n\nThat or he's shitty and transphobic.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe glad you found out your ex is a transphobic AH before the relationship progressed any more.", "NTA. Remind your friends that this actually is your dad's medical history, and no one is entitled to know it just because they date you or are your friends. I know full well that trans issues are mostly not about medical history, but it also is a part of the subject and often gets disregarded. If you're in LGBTQ+ friendly area in general, maybe this would be enough to make your friends see this from a different perspective.\n\nYour BF needs some more detailed talking to, of course. Best luck on that!", "NTA\n\nHe sounds like he does not like trans people. I don't think your dad's gender history is for you to tell and honestly I don't know why he is so angry except for ugly or sad reasons (again phobia or maybe he is in some sort of denial about himself and your dad hit something sensitive). Either way this is an immature reaction to this news and I would have a good think before deciding on moving on with the relationship.", "NTA", "NAH. There's profound existential confusion all around. \n\nBF is understandably shocked and doesn't understand how OP can consider the woman who gave birth to her can now be a male parent. OP doesn't realise yet that she has been indoctrinated to believe contradictory things and that \"transgender\" is a lie. Parent thinks that males can get pregnant and give birth, and has been counselled abysmally by someone who stands to profit from her misery.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think this romance will survive, although I'd love to be proven wrong. I hope the talk goes better than I am expecting.", "NTA - There are details of our lives and the lives of our loved ones that just aren't relevant or needed by everyone. That your dad is trans is one of those details. He never needed to know that, and in no way shape or form effects him. So he never needed to know it. So you never told him. Same for your friends. \n\nYour friends are wrong. This isnt lying or keeping secrets. This is more like him assuming he should know your dads credit card number. There is no reason he should know that, and the fact that he seems to assume he should have it is kinda creepy.", "NTA.  This shouldn't be a hard thing for him and if it is you don't need him in your life.  I know it's hard because you liked him, and I'm sorry for that.", "NTA. Time to ghost your anti trans bf. And you can tell him the reason is because he's a bigot.", "Best case scenario, he was fishing for information that was none of his business and got angry he didn't get it. In other words, he's nosy at best. NTA.", "NTA. It definitely seems like he might not even be aware of the level of phobia he\u2019s carrying.  Sounded similar to how I responded to my ex telling me he might be bi. Angry that he \u201cdidn\u2019t tell me sooner.\u201d \n\nSurprise, I\u2019m a trans man and was just struggling with internalized transphobia. \n\nNobody owes you an explanation of any gender/sexuality before they\u2019re ready. I\u2019m not saying that my case is the same as your bf\u2019s, just that our brains really like tricking us into thinking we are always right. So when the nasty, uncomfortable feelings come up, we try to justify them in other ways. His hurt is real, but irrational.", "NTA\nWhat is in someone else's pants is none of his business. I'd imagine that he was embarrassed about it, either because he directly asked, or is transphobic and felt \"fooled\" and it upset him. But either way he's probably channeling his embarrassment about it into anger against you and maybe your dad. But the reality is that none of it was ever his business and no one owes him that information ever. It's not something you have to \"warm\" people about. You did nothing wrong.", "You're NTA. Your ex-boyfriend is just too delicate to handle unexpected facts; you're well rid of him.", "After a year, i would think that is an awesome truth to tell him but his reaction is terrible. He should have said, \"wow, that's awesome, tell me more!\"\n\nNta\n\nYour boyfriend is immature.", "If he was worried about her dad's perspective on him then he wouldn't have started audibly arguing with her straight after her dad revealed that he's trans.\n\nHe's just transphobic.", "They _are_ two gay (or bisexual) men.", "Yes, this! Op don't write your boyfriend off too soon. Ask him how he feels now and why he reacted this way. I can imagine him feeling embarrassed about assuming wrong/asking a sensitive question without knowing. He is young, right? Give him time to gather his senses, talk to him and then see how you feel about his answers.", "I don\u2019t have a birth mother, I have a birth father though who\u2019s been with for every up and down I\u2019ve has. I have two dads and my other bio one isn\u2019t in the picture since simply got no clue where he is and I don\u2019t really care. I grew up with two parents and I don\u2019t need another dad. I always been very content with that.", "she doesn't have a birth mother. im sure OP talks about her dads a lot.", "Because he's her father not mother?", "Because you, too, are an arsehole? \n\nThat would be my guess", "I think you should also talk to your friends about \u201clying\u201d and whether or not they would tell their their dates about personal info about their parents, info that as you know is irrelevant, doesn\u2019t affect them and isn\u2019t your truth to tell. Not necessarily to start conflict but to open a conversation with them and give you all insight on what is and isn\u2019t lying and what is and isn\u2019t \u201cgossip\u201d or over sharing someone else\u2019s personal information. It also give you the opportunity to learn how to constructively talk about opposing opinions with peers.", "The only possible way bf is NTA  is if he was miffed with you because,\" I wish I knew so I didn't make your dad uncomfortable\".  \n\n\nYou didn't lie he wasn't/isn't entitled to the information.", "It\u2019s like \u201cnot all racists run around screaming racial slurs.\u201d Sometimes, bigotry is more subtle, and doesn\u2019t become obvious until something happens to force it out into the open.", "That's not low key transphobia. That's straight up transphobia!", "Agree. If I were the boyfriend I would be a little hurt not being told something like that after a year of dating, especially since not knowing is something that could put me in an awkward situation with the biodad. That being said, the way the bf reacted - by shouting, making a scene, running away and ignoring her - is crazy and suggests that the issue almost for sure goes way deeper than that", "The keyword is biological", "Honey,  sounds like you need new friends too if they think that's lying", "If he isn\u2019t pro LGBTQ+ her parents being in the group would almost by default make her pro as well. If he wasnt pro this would obviously be an issue for him. \n\nNot saying it\u2019s the case but this is all I could think of honestly, as you were saying it doesn\u2019t affect they\u2019re daily life outside of that.", "Lots of cis people are relatively accepting of trans people as a concept, until they actually have a trans person in their personal life.", "ok true, i just know people can be touchy abt it and i didn\u2019t wanna get dogpiled and downvoted but yeah it is just straight up transphobia", "Biological just means related by blood. It doesn\u2019t erase the fact that op\u2019s dad is a man.", "How is he even saying you lied? It sounds like the first time the subject came up", "[removed]", "It doesn\u2019t mean he is transphobic. He is possibly just mad he was caught off guard and accidentally fucked up in asking about your Mom and possibly felt upset about that.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know until you talk to him, just don\u2019t jump to any conclusions.", "Makes sense to me, but he\u2019s in his feelings atm. Fingers crossed he\u2019s not transphobic and just in a bit of narrative shock. Like thought one thing and turned out to be very different. He\u2019s still young and so are you so grace is appreciated, but be prepared for nasty unfortunately. Not everyone understands.", "That\u2019s good advice."]}
