One is my stepdad, though he still raised me and I consider him just my dad Ill call him stepdad for this, and the other is my bio dad who is also transgender. My dad passes and he doesn\u2019t tell people about it because it really isn\u2019t their business for most people, but never been scared to tell people if they somehow asked about it in any way. But he gave birth to me and since has had my younger brother with my stepdad. \n\nEveryone at school knows that knows me knows about me having two dads and even though I gotten teased before, it\u2019s never been a huge deal. The issue is with my boyfriend (18m). We been dating for a year and we been friends since the start of high school. He has known since the beginning of me having two dads and never had a problem before, but when he came over he saw my dad looking through my baby book and my dad invited him since he will always take a chance to show me off (embarrass me) and at first it was all cute and wholesome, but then my boyfriend asked my dad about my mom which was awkward but my dad told him straight up that he was the one he gave birth to me and he is technically my mom. My boyfriend was just like \u201coh\u201d and was pretty quiet for the rest of it around my dad, but when we went to my room he got mad at me for lying to him about my parents and birth. We argued since I didn\u2019t think it was important that my dad is trans and asked why it was even an issue. He just avoided answering me and soon we got loud and I told him to leave. He did and I just felt like crying, my dad heard us and came to me and comforted me. I can tell he feels bad, but he hasn\u2019t said anything much. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, but when I talked to my friends most of them said I was in the wrong. I don\u2019t even get what he is mad about in the first place. He hasn\u2019t talked to me since and it\u2019s been three days, we normally met up in a specific spot together before school, but he wasn\u2019t there and he hasn\u2019t talked to me in our shared classes. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for here, but I guess another perspective on it, maybe some insight? I\u2019m not sure, but was I wrong?\n\nEdit: Thank you for your replies, it made me feel better that I wasn\u2019t crazy for it. I said it in a reply, but I\u2019m planning to talk to him tomorrow at school. Let\u2019s hope for the best.

No person with cis parents tells anyone they date intimate stuff about their parents' personal lives and bodies, like how long their mom nursed them or how many moles their dad has on his butts. Bf is giving off transphobic vibes and if he continues to make a big deal of this, then be glad you found out who he is early enough.", "NTA-I'm an old lady, so please forgive if I sound offensive, I truly have no ill-intent.  I can't for the life of me understand what your bf can possibly be mad about.  Even if he assumed that your dads are a traditional same sex couple (that phrase alone makes me \ud83d\ude03), then he should have some clue that there had to be a person who birthed you.  Sounds like your school's biology curriculum is lacking.", "NTA. You have parents. They're your parents. We don't tell our high school partners everything about our parents because (IMO) that would be weird. You were right to respect your dads' privacy.", "How is he even saying you lied?  It sounds like the first time the subject came up, he got told the whole story.", "NTA.  He's arguing with you about someone else; your bf needs to grow up.  He may feel embarrassed having led the conversation down an awkward path that would have been avoidable with more information -but that's not the end of the world. Hopefully he'll process some small embarrassment and allow things to go back to how they were.", "NTA. Cis people constantly assume trans people are cis and then get mad at us, or in this case, our family members for \"lying\" or \"deceiving\" when we truly were not trying to hide anything, they just got in trouble with their own assumptions. Like your Dad was, I am a pregnant trans man. I cannot tell you the number of times I explicitly say \"I am pregnant,\" \"My back hurts,\" \"I've been throwing up, etc.\" and people still continue to assume that I am talking about my wife.", "NTA. Its understandable that he is suprised and didnt know how to react. The full argument later does sound a bit like he does have issues with trans people.", "Examples of lies of omission that matter long term:  your martial status, your criminal record, the existence of children.  Things that in some substantial way can affect the other if the relationship becomes serious enough to intermingle households, make long-term plans together, etc.  \n\nExamples of things that absolutely don't matter to him or his future if he stays with you:  the status of your parent's genitalia during birth.  \n\nNTA - I might give him a chance to explain himself if there is something else going on here, but I highly doubt it.  Find a partner that doesn't care about your Dad's penis or lack there of any more than you do!  (Not to diminish your Dad's journey, of course.)", "NTA for not telling him, but my guess is that he was more angry because he caused an embarrassing moment by asking about the bio mother when it was your dad all along. He was probably worried about your dad's perspective of him, bc he's your boyfriend, and he wants acceptance from your dads. Just give him some space to process it but let him know you're eager to talk when he's ready.", "Nta-they had preconceived notions that you didn\u2019t put there. It shouldn\u2019t make a difference to him one way or another. Now he knows the story from another angle.", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong and you didn't lie. It wasn't brought up and it shouldn't matter to your bf. The narrative however,  him and your friends are turning it against you. Which you shouldn't listen and be bothered with. I hope you and your dads are feeling better.", "NTA. The way you were birthed doesn't really matter. It doesn't affect who you are as a person. I know you and your boyfriend are still young, but he is behaving incredibly immature by ignoring you. Now is the time to work out what you are worth. You don't need to put up with being ignored by your partner who should be communicating their issue with you.", "NTA he made a dumb and poor assumption and is probably transphobic", "NTA it's none of his business. Your dad is your dad regardless of whether he gave birth to you or not. Might wanna reflect on if he's shown transphobic tendencies or not.", "NTA. From what I understand, this was the first time it came up so you told him everything. I'm not sure where you could've lied so you didn't do anything wrong, and I'm not sure why your friends are telling you that you did. \n\nAs you said in your original post, this information isn't other people's business and whether dad chooses to share this is his decision. No one is entitled to this information nor are they entitled to get upset because they didn't, whether it is random people, or your boyfriend. The only person who can make this decision is the person themselves or anyone that said person allows. Your dad is your dad, and that's all that matters (your parents sound sweet btw). \n\nFeeling entitled and betrayed feels kinda gross though and giving you the cold shoulder for a few days is kinda concerning to me though. Like he got upset because he didn't get told about your dad's identity. Like genuinely why does that matter because he's dating you, not your dad. Why does he care about how you were born. Also with a reaction like that, wouldn't someone want to clarify what they meant.  \n\nI  don't know your boyfriend personally so I don't know how he usually acts and i don't wish to assume  but talking to him about the situation is your best bet, even if he's making it hard. Let him make himself known how he feels because it's best to find this out soon, as much as it's sad. If anything it'll be his loss. \n\nI wish you all luck though. I hope what I said makes sense.", "was he upset because he felt embarrassed that he asked your dad about your mom and then it turned out your dad was your mom? because i probably wouldve been embarrassed if i made that mistake and wouldve definitely been kinda like \u201cwhy didnt you tell me im so embarrassed?!\u201d but other than that it sounds like hes overreacting, nta either way", "NTA\n\nBeing gay is vastly different than being transgender. Your BF got caught off guard and probably didn\u2019t know how to handle this new information in the moment. It was sprung on him and he reacted poorly, probably because he was embarrassed and uncomfortable.\n\nBe a little understanding, but don\u2019t let yourself feel like crap over this! This is not your fault, and it is not your responsibility to explain your father\u2019s life choices to anyone.\n\nHow you move forward is more important. If it\u2019s too weird for your bf then move on. \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t lie, you just didn\u2019t provide him with extra information you didn\u2019t think was necessary and understandably so, your Dad is your Dad!\n\nBut I can understand your boyfriend (of a year, too) feeling mightily embarrassed asking your Dad about who your Mom is, when he was speaking to him the whole time.\nI\u2019d have probably been a bit miffed that my partner let me walk into that, just because any kind of awkward situation with in-laws or partners parents can be mortifying", "NTA - first, it\u2019s literally none of his damn business about how you were brought into being. Second, that\u2019s a massive red flag with him giving you silent treatment and avoiding you entirely. He\u2019s angry over information that wasn\u2019t necessary for him to know to care for and love you.", "NTA. Don\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t lie to your boyfriend. He was just overreacting. We don\u2019t get to tell someone about our life unless we are asked to.", "NTA. It isn't your boyfriend's business the status of your parents. The personal history of your parents is theirs to reveal as they want. Just because your BF is dating you does not mean that your family's entire history should be an open book to him, and he is not entitled to every piece of information about your family.\n\nKeep something in mind: *you did nothing wrong!* Your boyfriend is the one who is reacting badly, and your friends are mistaken when they said that you did something wrong. It is not your BF's business who gave birth to you, who are your biological parents are, if you are adopted, or even if you are a clone of one of your parents. And he needs to get over himself and understand this.\n\nHe also needs to understand that there *will* be a time, in any relationship, that information like this will be revealed for the first time - it's not like you will download your entire family history the first time you meet, or even on your first date. In short, your BF needs to grow up and realize that he is not the center of the universe. And that is the polite interpretation - the less charitable one that he is just plain transphobic and reacting badly because of that.", "You\u2019ve been together a year and never talked about what happened to your birth mother or where she is??", "Your BF was blindsided by the information and had to react in the moment rather than knowing already. \n\nIn that moment that your dad told him, try to think about what was going through his mind. \n\n\"Ok, I didn't know that... Why didn't my girlfriend tell me? Oh damn, I'm being quiet all of a sudden. Do they think I'm against it? I really don't want to seem against it, why didn't she tell me?\"\n\nSure it's none of his business.

I don't like how much this sub tends to break up but on this one and especially as young as you are... break up.\n\nWho your parents are are not who YOU are. You could have a murderer for a parents, someone with addiction, someone with hoarding, whatever. That's not you, that's them. Even small things like my mom NEVER SHUTS UP.

She really went off her rocker and fell for the Trace Adkins scam and spent 5k on it, she'd get pissed when FIL tried to talk to her about and when she saw the articles where Trace Adkins said he was happily married and those were fake accounts and to please not fall for them. They ended up divorced after 20 some years. Last I heard she still thought Trace was gonna come pick her up in a helicopter! I hope she gets the help she needs as she's moved back to family.

It makes me sad the guy I have told I love you multiple times to and known for years would think like this.", "it's not hyperbolic. the bf is transphobic.", "Oh, I\u2019m 100% with you. I have to wonder if he built up a narrative in his head of her being abandoned by her mom and single dad raised her and found a new partner only to find it a bit different than what he imagined. Doesn\u2019t justify the reaction, but he is a teenager and I wonder if she just said my other parent left or whatever and he made assumptions based on what he thought he knew so is feeling deceived by his own assumptions and is blaming her for it bc it wasn\u2019t clarified.

At the same time - you and your bf are young, and his maturity level isn\u2019t that if an adult. He feels like he has a right to know EVERYTHING about your life, and he doesn\u2019t. But he feels betrayed because it feels like a big secret was kept from him, when he thought you trusted him. (You likely DO trust him, but is your dad\u2019s business to share not yours). Maybe sit down with him AND your dad to help make it clear it\u2019s your DAD\u2019S life to disclose or not, and not yours. \n\nEither your boyfriend will come to his senses, or he will prove himself too immature for a serious relationship.

You are 100% right that it SHOULDN'T have been a big deal!

You didn\u2019t lie, it\u2019s just not your truth to tell. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but your dad and who he decides to share this with. He never saw it as a big deal so why would you?

Weird story but when I was 20ish my mum called to tell me my dad was gay and to have papsmears before hanging up (side note my dad is not gay but because we interpreted his refusal to discuss the matter (he refused to deny it because he didn\u2019t need to justify his sexuality to anyone) as him not feeling open since mum \u2018outed him\u2019, respected that and didn\u2019t find out he wasn\u2019t gay for 5 years. Fuck my family)\n\nAnyway the point is that I without the slightest bit of homophobia in my body, took a couple of days to process because it altered the picture I had of my dad at an age where I still felt like that picture mattered.\n\nNot that he needs a picture in his head of your family but recognising that he may not have always received an unbiased perspective of trans people he may have felt overwhelmed and need a minute to process.", "NTA.

He may have other beliefs when it comes to that sort of stuff. Your dad sounds awesome and courageous. Be more like your dad and own it, don't ever care what others think.", "I agree.

I all call them grandmother, aunt and niece. When people ask who any if them are I won\u2019t explain anything I just did. I just tell them they are my grandmother, aunt and niece. It is not a lie.

Same goes up for you. Your mother transitioned into your father. So yes, technically your dad is your mother but formally and legally your dad is your father. So you were not lying. Why should you be the one explaining every detail about your past to anybody? You shouldn\u2019t. It is not their business. Regardless of the subject, you are allowed to keep your past to yourself (as long as you are not hurting others). \n\nIt is a red flag to me that he is this mad about it. Is he this mad because you didn\u2019t tell him (while it is not his business)? Or because your father turned out to be your birth mother?

Can you elaborate as to why your mind goes there but you seem to think it\u2019s something else?", "Eh. No. You're not allowed to act like an ass because you got embarrassed. I am a trans man, and even tho my work is generally accepting, I have come into problems before. \n\nMost recently I had to email a coworker that I'm trans and my pronouns are he/him as he kept misgendering me. (I am recently transitioned with top surgery, I currently look like a teen boy with a fuzzy mustache, but my coworkers met me as a woman and are still adjusting.) Well this coworker got \"anxious\" that I was going to go to HR and get him \"in trouble,\" and he had a family and \"needed this job,\" so instead of accepting that he keeps goofing up my pronouns and trying harder, he decided to pretend I didn't exist. 100%, no hellos, no professional communication, leaves work 20 minutes early just to avoid me. \n\nI had to contact my supervisor and clear the air. I wasn't (and don't) go overboard with correcting pronouns, but I have the right to exist and gently correct people as needed without being treated like a leper. Even my super said some gross things which I won't repeat here. I look forward to getting a new job where this won't be an issue anymore. \n\nTransphobia isn't just people who blatantly act like asses. What happened to OP is transphobia. What happened to me at work is transphobia. Acting like an asshole because you felt \"lied to\" or were \"embarrassed\" somehow by someone's gender is transphobia.

It literally doesn't matter who your parents are as long as they love and care for you.\n\nAs a transman myself I just want to say I'm in awe to hear about your dad. I'm only in my midtwenties but hearing about older trans men, esp those who have had children is really rare. A lot of our elders were killed off in the AIDS crisis and there weren't many of us to begin with. Idk what else to say. Just that I'm proud of him? Is that weird? I'm also proud of you for supporting your dad. It's really sweet.", "NTA - dump him and find yourself a mature specimen please", "Are you your father? No? Oh wow, then it's almost like you don't have to lie on his behalf xD\n\nMan, your 'friends' sound like a hoot", "NTA - I\u2019m adopted. When I tell people about my parents, I don\u2019t specify adoptive parents, because it\u2019s no one else\u2019s business. If someone in my life got mad at me doe \u201clying\u201d because I didn\u2019t mention they\u2019re not my biological parents, I\u2019d kick them to the curb.\n\nYour boyfriend is not entitled to the private medical information of the people who birthed you.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t lie to him, you didn\u2019t make up some story about who your mom is or anything like that.

It\u2019s on the same level of asking a transgender person what\u2019s in their pants. At the least, your boyfriend is insensitive. At the most, he\u2019s rude as fuck and entitled.", "NTA boyfriend is a big ol transphobe.", "NTA, you never lied, the subject never came or mattered. He might be transphobic, you might want to consider breaking up.", "NTA he\u2019s a transphobe and not worth your time.

Dump his ass. NTA.", "You poor children", "I'll go with YTA.\n\nYour bf embarrassed himself in front of your parents because you assumed he didn't need to know the very unusual background of your family. It might not be anyone's business, but the person you want to share bits of your privacy with NEEDS to know.", "NTA. You should seriously think about the relationship with your boyfriend or anyone who is angry with you about something that you have no control over. For example, your ethnicity, parents, social background and etc.", "NTA. You didn't lie. Your dad's gender history is his truth to tell, not yours. It is a major red flag that your boyfriend is this angry about it.", "NTA red flag that he reacted this way", "NTA\n\nMy wife is transgender - she came out about 4 years ago. We got married 24 years ago and we have 2 teenagers. My wife passes really well. But she is also very open about being trans.\n\nSometimes people ask nosy questions about our family, like who is the dad or how did we get married before same sex marriage was legal? People who have known us for awhile may ask me about what happened to [deadname].\n\nDepending on who it is, we may clarify or not. Sometimes we mess with them (I told one person who asked about [deadname] that I upgraded). Sometimes we ignore it. \n\nYour boyfriend needs to get over himself. It is not your place to share your trans dad's history unless your dad is cool with it.", "I would have been confused at first (I'm a lil slow) but yeah I don't understand why someone would get angry over this. Nta OP", "This was my thought! His embarrassment came out as anger. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d act like this over them being trans as he was fine with op having two dads", "Everyone is jumping to him being this terrible person, but I think you've hit the nail on the head. I think he got embarrassed over it, and he lashed out because of it. \n\nIt's not too surprising for an 18 year old to act so emotionally immature. What is surprising is the number of grown adults that are labelling him as a bad person or a walking red flag over a badly handled situation on his part.\n\nI agree with you though that OP is NTA and her boyfriend definitely has some maturing to do", "If I\u2019m honest I wasn\u2019t maturest about it. Not that I yelled or something, but I remember he asked me when we first met and I just said I had two dads and he was like oh ok. Later on when we known each other and he had met my family a few times he asked again and I just laughed it off and said something on the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t have a mom, my dad did all the work.\u201dI don\u2019t like just coming out for my dad since yea he\u2019s open but I respect him and I don\u2019t want to do that for him. I said it in a vague way where it was implied, but now looking back that point would never come across at all. I, in all honesty, should had communicated when he asked me instead of laughing it off. I should had been more honest with him, and also communicated with my dad more about telling the people around me since I also just made assumptions about him not wanting me to tell others and I can admit I did not communicate well regarding that with either him and my dad. It sucks but I can\u2019t change the past and I can only take this and learn that I need to communicate to the people around me to sustain relationships. I\u2019m going to be talking to him soon after the bell rings in an hr and guess we will know more.", "He's probably uncomfortable with trans people for some misguided reason, and it's weird af he got that mad about it. \n\nIt's not even like he was about to have sex with your dad and was surprised by his romantic partner's unmentioned transition. I am struggling to find a reason for him to be upset other than transphobia", "NTA, hon. I honestly never, ever thought about what genitalia my BFs parents had because, ew. And as others have pointed out, this is a red flag. Accepting your partner\u2019s story and background is the bedrock of any relationship. You don\u2019t owe him more time just because you\u2019ve spent time, you know?", "You are still in an age group where there is still these black/white ways of looking at things. Children need that while growing up bc they do not have the ability to understand all the layers and complexity of life. Then they grow up and slowly learn the \"gray\" areas as well. So in his b/w mind he still sees it as a lie bc it was a half truth. Most probably it does not come from a homophobic or transphobic place but at that age it is very vulnerable still to be in a romantic relationship. I'm not justifying his actions, just explaining and you have every right to be upset. He might surprise you and eventually appologise, or maybe not, who knows? See if there is a more valuable lesson here on how you approach your not so common family dynamic with outsiders. More caution, less caution? No right or wrong, just see what can work best for you!", "Our opinion about an issue often changes when we come face to face with it. Some people may be \"pro life\" until they find themselves unexpectedly pregnant. I used to see myself as very liberal and accepting, but actually meeting a trans person terrified me. I realized I would not be comfortable being left alone with a penis owner, regardless of their gender identity. I kept these thoughts to myself - I'm an adult and recognize my biases are my problem. Your boyfriend (ex?) does not yet have a filter and acts on his emotions. He showed you what his true feelings are. I'm sorry you had to find out this way. Maybe he'll change his views once he processes everything, but it's safer to assume the two of you are not compatible.", "Do you actually have a point?", "Thank you for replying.", "I do! My parents are very involved with everything I do and every friday we have a family game night or do a puzzle together and I love it. From what my parents and my friends\u2019 parents said I somehow skipped the teen angst phase lol. My boyfriend has even been invited to them a few times on few occasions and those were always fun.", "Bruh i literally said it wasnt up to her what do you mean lmao", "I said i can kinda understand the guys perspective if i put myself in his shoes i said it would be nice to know but ultimately its not up to her", "Most of my friends didn\u2019t actually know the whole truth and about my dad being trans. I\u2019m not sure he told his personal circle but if he did they haven\u2019t told our mutual friends and etc. I\u2019m relieved about that bc I don\u2019t want people treating my dad differently for it. Again, my dad if asked will be honest and isn\u2019t ashamed at all, but for a bunch of people to suddenly know I bet is uncomfortable and I will always put my family first.", "Wow what a stupid response.", "Several things:\n- While seeking education is a good thing and asking questions is better than living in fear and confusion of people who are different than you, a better place for this question would have been r/asktransgender or similar\u2014not a question directed at the child of a gay couple, who probably doesn\u2019t want to think about their dads having sex.\n- OP doesn\u2019t say that their dads are gay; they could also be bisexual\u2014but, even so:\n- Gay sex comes in many forms. Many gay people date/marry trans people of their preferred gender. The keyword here is gender, not sex\u2014while some people may prefer to only interact intimately with people of a certain sex, many people who identify as gay (\u201chomosexual\u201d) do not have a specific SEX preference, and will be attracted to the same gender regardless of what parts they have. People who only date/marry people of their same gender are gay.", "There is a big chunk of people that are pro gay (or cool with gay people or even gay themselves but transphobic unfortunately). Look up \u201cdrop the t campaign\u201d if you want to be sad", "Not everyone that's trans has gender dysphoria. My partner does and their nightmare is absolutely getting pregnant, but plenty of non-binary people have no dysphoria and some transmasc men have gender euphoria for being men and are kinda neutral, if ill fitting, in their feminine bodies. It really depends, you know?", "Well I mean, along those lines, op never lied to anyone, they just don't talk about their dad being trans.\n\nAnd before anyone says it, no, trans people are not \"lying\" to you or anyone else if they don't disclose they are trans. It means they don't trust you or are at a point in life where they don't disclose anymore to basically everyone new in their life (called being stealth, I'm at a semi stealth phase right now, I pass as a cis person to 95% of the folks I talk to daily). Not saying you are though so don't take it the wrong way.", "So your boyfriend's reaction to finding out about your dad was to immediately start outing him to anyone and everyone he could.\n\nYeah, that's not a safe person to be around.", "from OP\u2019s other comments, the boyfriend is upset at \u2018being deceived\u2019 which is a really common buzzword so while i\u2019d love to share your empathy, i unfortunately don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case", "Interesting! Thank you for that perspective.", "I'm not. I fully get what you are saying and agree with you. I'm just trying to see the potential other side of the equation.", "Maybe he's not transphobic. Let's give people the benefit of the doubt. He's a teenage boy, it's very possible he was just embarrassed that he asked and feels like he looks stupid for not knowing. If she talks to him and then it comes out that he's transphobic then we can bash him, but until then I'm inclined to believe he's just being a regular asshole instead of a transphobic one.", "big up, you\u2019re handing this very maturely. it\u2019s always best to have a conversation, if nothing else to help you make up your mind. also i\u2019m usually against putting relationship stuff online but this sub can sometimes be good for getting perspective! \n\ngenuinely i posted here 4 years ago because my girlfriend was a dick to my friends and made various threats at me but she had me so messed up i didn\u2019t know if it was my fault. this sub made me realise i wasn\u2019t insane/the one abusing her, and i broke up with her a few days later", "Yeah! I fully understand, how else are we supposed to get to the root of the conversation/conflict if someone's not at least representing the opposing opinion.", "Regular asshole in this case is still transphobic, explicitly or not.

Bring a teenager doesn't absolve you from not being a shitty person.", "I always been a huge lurker tbh and I think reddit gets a far too bad of a rep than it is because I genuinely seen people have eye openers about their relationships whether it\u2019s friends, partner, or family that it was toxic as hell.

I agree that his behavior is crappy.", "I meant to mention her own history, not a full-on history about the dads life. I agree fully on how he should have reacted, I was merely wondering if his extreme reaction towards her was really due to him being transphobic. But seeing the answers from OP, it's most def highly fishy in that department.", "Try couching this as medical information. For your dad, that's what it is, right? Medical information he sometimes chooses to share if it's relevant. So it never occurred to you to share it, since bf is neither a doctor nor his doctor. Hopefully that convinces the ah to stop spreading your dad's medical info around too.\n\nAlso you're being super mature about this! It's clear your dad's raised you well. It's bf's loss if you do break up.", "GIRLY that\u2019s super super weird of him", "Have you talked to him about it today?", "Blargh, yeah that reaction is definitely effed up. You did not deceive anyone, if anything he seems to have deceived you into thinking he was decent. Thank you for the added info though. I wish you and your family all the best!", "Nono, of course he shouldn't have behaved the way he did!
