One is my stepdad, though he still raised me and I consider him just my dad Ill call him stepdad for this, and the other is my bio dad who is also transgender. My dad passes and he doesn\u2019t tell people about it because it really isn\u2019t their business for most people, but never been scared to tell people if they somehow asked about it in any way. But he gave birth to me and since has had my younger brother with my stepdad. \n\nEveryone at school knows that knows me knows about me having two dads and even though I gotten teased before, it\u2019s never been a huge deal. The issue is with my boyfriend (18m). We been dating for a year and we been friends since the start of high school. He has known since the beginning of me having two dads and never had a problem before, but when he came over he saw my dad looking through my baby book and my dad invited him since he will always take a chance to show me off (embarrass me) and at first it was all cute and wholesome, but then my boyfriend asked my dad about my mom which was awkward but my dad told him straight up that he was the one he gave birth to me and he is technically my mom. My boyfriend was just like \u201coh\u201d and was pretty quiet for the rest of it around my dad, but when we went to my room he got mad at me for lying to him about my parents and birth. We argued since I didn\u2019t think it was important that my dad is trans and asked why it was even an issue. He just avoided answering me and soon we got loud and I told him to leave. He did and I just felt like crying, my dad heard us and came to me and comforted me. I can tell he feels bad, but he hasn\u2019t said anything much. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, but when I talked to my friends most of them said I was in the wrong. I don\u2019t even get what he is mad about in the first place. He hasn\u2019t talked to me since and it\u2019s been three days, we normally met up in a specific spot together before school, but he wasn\u2019t there and he hasn\u2019t talked to me in our shared classes. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for here, but I guess another perspective on it, maybe some insight? I\u2019m not sure, but was I wrong?\n\nEdit: Thank you for your replies, it made me feel better that I wasn\u2019t crazy for it. I said it in a reply, but I\u2019m planning to talk to him tomorrow at school. Let\u2019s hope for the best.

No person with cis parents tells anyone they date intimate stuff about their parents' personal lives and bodies, like how long their mom nursed them or how many moles their dad has on his butts. Bf is giving off transphobic vibes and if he continues to make a big deal of this, then be glad you found out who he is early enough.", "NTA-I'm an old lady, so please forgive if I sound offensive, I truly have no ill-intent.  I can't for the life of me understand what your bf can possibly be mad about.  Even if he assumed that your dads are a traditional same sex couple (that phrase alone makes me \ud83d\ude03), then he should have some clue that there had to be a person who birthed you.  Sounds like your school's biology curriculum is lacking.", "NTA. You have parents. They're your parents. We don't tell our high school partners everything about our parents because (IMO) that would be weird. You were right to respect your dads' privacy.", "How is he even saying you lied?  It sounds like the first time the subject came up, he got told the whole story.", "NTA.  He's arguing with you about someone else; your bf needs to grow up.  He may feel embarrassed having led the conversation down an awkward path that would have been avoidable with more information -but that's not the end of the world. Hopefully he'll process some small embarrassment and allow things to go back to how they were.", "NTA. Cis people constantly assume trans people are cis and then get mad at us, or in this case, our family members for \"lying\" or \"deceiving\" when we truly were not trying to hide anything, they just got in trouble with their own assumptions. Like your Dad was, I am a pregnant trans man. I cannot tell you the number of times I explicitly say \"I am pregnant,\" \"My back hurts,\" \"I've been throwing up, etc.\" and people still continue to assume that I am talking about my wife.", "NTA. Its understandable that he is suprised and didnt know how to react. The full argument later does sound a bit like he does have issues with trans people.", "Examples of lies of omission that matter long term:  your martial status, your criminal record, the existence of children.  Things that in some substantial way can affect the other if the relationship becomes serious enough to intermingle households, make long-term plans together, etc.  \n\nExamples of things that absolutely don't matter to him or his future if he stays with you:  the status of your parent's genitalia during birth.  \n\nNTA - I might give him a chance to explain himself if there is something else going on here, but I highly doubt it.  Find a partner that doesn't care about your Dad's penis or lack there of any more than you do!  (Not to diminish your Dad's journey, of course.)", "NTA for not telling him, but my guess is that he was more angry because he caused an embarrassing moment by asking about the bio mother when it was your dad all along. He was probably worried about your dad's perspective of him, bc he's your boyfriend, and he wants acceptance from your dads. Just give him some space to process it but let him know you're eager to talk when he's ready.", "Nta-they had preconceived notions that you didn\u2019t put there. It shouldn\u2019t make a difference to him one way or another. Now he knows the story from another angle.", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong and you didn't lie. It wasn't brought up and it shouldn't matter to your bf. The narrative however,  him and your friends are turning it against you. Which you shouldn't listen and be bothered with. I hope you and your dads are feeling better.", "NTA. The way you were birthed doesn't really matter. It doesn't affect who you are as a person. I know you and your boyfriend are still young, but he is behaving incredibly immature by ignoring you. Now is the time to work out what you are worth. You don't need to put up with being ignored by your partner who should be communicating their issue with you.", "NTA he made a dumb and poor assumption and is probably transphobic", "NTA it's none of his business. Your dad is your dad regardless of whether he gave birth to you or not. Might wanna reflect on if he's shown transphobic tendencies or not.", "NTA. From what I understand, this was the first time it came up so you told him everything. I'm not sure where you could've lied so you didn't do anything wrong, and I'm not sure why your friends are telling you that you did. \n\nAs you said in your original post, this information isn't other people's business and whether dad chooses to share this is his decision. No one is entitled to this information nor are they entitled to get upset because they didn't, whether it is random people, or your boyfriend. The only person who can make this decision is the person themselves or anyone that said person allows. Your dad is your dad, and that's all that matters (your parents sound sweet btw). \n\nFeeling entitled and betrayed feels kinda gross though and giving you the cold shoulder for a few days is kinda concerning to me though. Like he got upset because he didn't get told about your dad's identity. Like genuinely why does that matter because he's dating you, not your dad. Why does he care about how you were born. Also with a reaction like that, wouldn't someone want to clarify what they meant.  \n\nI  don't know your boyfriend personally so I don't know how he usually acts and i don't wish to assume  but talking to him about the situation is your best bet, even if he's making it hard. Let him make himself known how he feels because it's best to find this out soon, as much as it's sad. If anything it'll be his loss. \n\nI wish you all luck though. I hope what I said makes sense.", "was he upset because he felt embarrassed that he asked your dad about your mom and then it turned out your dad was your mom? because i probably wouldve been embarrassed if i made that mistake and wouldve definitely been kinda like \u201cwhy didnt you tell me im so embarrassed?!\u201d but other than that it sounds like hes overreacting, nta either way", "NTA\n\nBeing gay is vastly different than being transgender. Your BF got caught off guard and probably didn\u2019t know how to handle this new information in the moment. It was sprung on him and he reacted poorly, probably because he was embarrassed and uncomfortable.\n\nBe a little understanding, but don\u2019t let yourself feel like crap over this! This is not your fault, and it is not your responsibility to explain your father\u2019s life choices to anyone.\n\nHow you move forward is more important. If it\u2019s too weird for your bf then move on. \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t lie, you just didn\u2019t provide him with extra information you didn\u2019t think was necessary and understandably so, your Dad is your Dad!\n\nBut I can understand your boyfriend (of a year, too) feeling mightily embarrassed asking your Dad about who your Mom is, when he was speaking to him the whole time.\nI\u2019d have probably been a bit miffed that my partner let me walk into that, just because any kind of awkward situation with in-laws or partners parents can be mortifying", "NTA - first, it\u2019s literally none of his damn business about how you were brought into being. Second, that\u2019s a massive red flag with him giving you silent treatment and avoiding you entirely. He\u2019s angry over information that wasn\u2019t necessary for him to know to care for and love you.", "NTA. Don\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t lie to your boyfriend. He was just overreacting. We don\u2019t get to tell someone about our life unless we are asked to.", "NTA. It isn't your boyfriend's business the status of your parents. The personal history of your parents is theirs to reveal as they want. Just because your BF is dating you does not mean that your family's entire history should be an open book to him, and he is not entitled to every piece of information about your family.\n\nKeep something in mind: *you did nothing wrong!* Your boyfriend is the one who is reacting badly, and your friends are mistaken when they said that you did something wrong. It is not your BF's business who gave birth to you, who are your biological parents are, if you are adopted, or even if you are a clone of one of your parents. And he needs to get over himself and understand this.\n\nHe also needs to understand that there *will* be a time, in any relationship, that information like this will be revealed for the first time - it's not like you will download your entire family history the first time you meet, or even on your first date. In short, your BF needs to grow up and realize that he is not the center of the universe. And that is the polite interpretation - the less charitable one that he is just plain transphobic and reacting badly because of that.", "You\u2019ve been together a year and never talked about what happened to your birth mother or where she is??", "Your BF was blindsided by the information and had to react in the moment rather than knowing already. \n\nIn that moment that your dad told him, try to think about what was going through his mind. \n\n\"Ok, I didn't know that... Why didn't my girlfriend tell me? Oh damn, I'm being quiet all of a sudden. Do they think I'm against it? I really don't want to seem against it, why didn't she tell me?\"\n\nSure it's none of his business.

I don't like how much this sub tends to break up but on this one and especially as young as you are... break up.\n\nWho your parents are are not who YOU are. You could have a murderer for a parents, someone with addiction, someone with hoarding, whatever. That's not you, that's them. Even small things like my mom NEVER SHUTS UP.

She really went off her rocker and fell for the Trace Adkins scam and spent 5k on it, she'd get pissed when FIL tried to talk to her about and when she saw the articles where Trace Adkins said he was happily married and those were fake accounts and to please not fall for them. They ended up divorced after 20 some years. Last I heard she still thought Trace was gonna come pick her up in a helicopter! I hope she gets the help she needs as she's moved back to family.

I have to wonder if he built up a narrative in his head of her being abandoned by her mom and single dad raised her and found a new partner only to find it a bit different than what he imagined.
