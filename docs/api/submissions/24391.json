My dad and his wife, Sandy, were attending a wedding last weekend and hired a babysitter for my stepsister Abby (5f). I (16m) was supposed to do it but I work now so they had to hire someone to stay the weekend with Abby.\n\nThe background is simple. Dad and Sandy met 4 years ago. I met her 3 months after my dad did and Abby like a week later. Abby suffers from nightmares pretty frequently. She would always seek someone out at night when she had them, usually her mom, though sometimes me, and I would always send her to her mom. This has been happening since she was 3.\n\nSo my dad and Sandy left Friday afternoon and were gone until Sunday afternoon. Friday night Abby had a nightmare and came to me and asked to sleep in my bed. I sent her back to her room and woke the babysitter who sat with her for a while. Abby was really upset about it and didn't sleep well that night and didn't sleep at all Saturday night. When my dad and Sandy got home they were furious with me for not letting Abby sleep with me.\n\nDad told me he's aware I don't see Abby as my sister but wouldn't I let a small kid sleep with me to help them after a nightmare. I said no. I would not be comfortable with that. He told me it's something I should get comfortable with for Abby's sake, so she can have a good brother to rely on. I told him that was not something I was going to work on. That other than Abby I doubt I will ever be asked by a kid unless that kid is my own and that will be different.\n\nSandy said it was my job to help her kid and that I made last weekend hell for her daughter.\n\nAll week dad and Sandy have been pissed about it. My mom died when I was 6 and I don't have extended family so I haven't been able to talk about this with anyone.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691755462, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o72sd/aita_for_sending_my_stepsister_back_to_her_room/", "score": 273, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe have a mat of some sort that she can lay down on with her pillow and blanket in your room so she can get that comfort temporarily, and then after a while tell her that she need to go back to her bed. You are not the parent in this situation and you are not responsible for watching her.

As a kid who had nightmares myself it took my parents saying it isn\u2019t real and forcing me to go back to my room for me to start not having the problem. That being said do not hold resentment against Abby as she is young for your Dad forcing Sandy and abby on you be nice as possible but do not let your father or sandy guilt you into a brotherly role if you don\u2019t want it as you could eventually start to hate the kid. Just be present, respectful, and cordial but if you\u2019re uncomfortable keep reasonable boundaries like this. Maybe with time you\u2019ll begin feeling like she\u2019s your sister but do not force it out of feeling like you owe it to her or the adults.", "YTA.\nLetting a young child alone with their nightmare is plain unkind. Sure enough, you didn't ask to be saddled with a step-sister, but this is your situation right now, and it's not that kid's fault.

I wonder how they were dealt with because you lack empathy for a small child.

It's not your job to take care of her, but telling a scared child to go away in the middle of the night is a bit heartless.

He could have given up a few days of comfort to help someone who was struggling with fear, especially since he probably knows what it's like to be scared without a parent to turn to since his mom passed when he was 6. But like we said it's not his \"responsibility\" and he's just a kid too.

They need to figure out a better way to deal with her nightmares, and not blame their lack of planning on the 16-year-old. The girl is five, she will get over it. I bet you, she even forgot it happened at this point. this is not a huge scarring moment for her. Yes, she was scared, and, yes, she was only comforted by a stranger.

But OP losing his sense of space and control, will have a lasting effect On his own psyche and future sense of control, and on his relationship with his parents.

No, we can't be sure that she'll move on so easily from being rejected by her step brother when she didn't have her parents. She's 5 and lots of issues start from a small child's perception of neglect. You don't get to decide which events are trauma to someone else. Again all of this is on the parents and I won't say OP is an asshole but still has lots of room to grow. My point is that a person doesn't have to be assigned a duty to feel for another person and want to comfort them. He didn't feel the need to comfort her, he just wanted the uncomfortable issue out of his room, so to me it appears he lacks empathy.", "This is the hill to die on.

SA happens a lot, and IMO in blended families it seems to crop up too often - even just the accusations. But I am also in support groups for blended families so that may just be what I'm exposes to most often. \n\nEither way, what if she made an accusation as little kids sometimes do? Bet you that stepmom would not give you the benefit of the doubt there - and realistically, she has to at least take the accusation seriously enough to figure things out.

I have NEVER expected my stepson to allow his brother to sleep with him.  Ever.  If stepson wanted to and offered like a sleepover, then fine.\n\nBut, nightmares are a grown adults problem to handle.  And, as my 8 year old sleepwalks, that isn't something I would put my 16 year old through, at all.  \n\n\nYour dad is wrong. Full Stop.

I am sorry she's having nightmares but you are a 16 yo male and she is a 5 yo female stepsister I do not think her climbing in bed with you is a good thing. She needs a nightlight maybe or a therapist to find out why she's having nightmares every night. Plus there was a sitter there to care for her to comfort her? Why are your parents even paying a sitter then? I mean they should be because a 16 yo shouldn't have to care a kid alone, but they also can not be upset by this.", "NTA... \n\nI even suggest googling the dangers of forcing relationships on stepsiblings and parentification of steosiblings. \n\nSearch out a few good sources and present your dad and stepmother with them. Tell them that they have no right to force you into a relationship you are uncomfortable with. Also remind them that punishing someone to force a relationship will just harm your own well being and make you respect them less. They don't sound like terrible people, they simply sound as if they ignored this a little to long and want to hand their failure solely on you, which is ridiculous. \n\nSeperately, I would also deeply consider why you feel this way. I won't call your feelings wrong at all, but they may be something you want to reflect on. Some of your own past trauma may be causing you to build emotional walls that won't help you to a better life long term. If you can identify some of these it may also help you better relate to your parents why you are uncomfortable.", "NTA Taking care of someone else's child is not your 'job' as your stepmom seems to think.

You are allowed to be uncomfortable with another human sharing your bed. You are allowed bodily (and bed) autonomy.

No. It's her job as the parent.", "NTA. If their kid can\u2019t handle them being gone they need to not be gone instead of pushing responsibility to you to handle.

There is just too much room for someone to make negative assumptions in our culture. Especially if there is an adult present to sit with her. You have some responsibilities as a step brother, but ultimately you are not the care giver here and if you are not comfortable, that should be accepted and respected.", "NTA, that would be completely inappropriate considering the age, gender and that you didn't grow up together. Sure, my siblings and I slept in the same bed sometimes, but that ended before any of us hit puberty.", "NTA and I applaud you for your solid decision making.

Your dad knows this.", "No, it\u2019s not a good idea to let a 5-year-child crawl in bed with whoever is home at the time.

It's not your responsibility to parent your stepsister. You made healthy boundaries for yourself.", "NAH. Mate, you're not her brother by blood, but you are a major (almost) adult in her life while she's going through a big change in her family situation.

I think you did right by sending her to the babysitter, but after that, if she was still having problems with nightmares, you could\u2019ve tried some alternatives. This is where the very soft YTA comes in: Why not escort her back to her bed and stay with her, beside her bed, with door open (to satisfy society) until she falls asleep (If and only if she was uncomfortable with the babysitter!)?    I get that she\u2019s not your responsibility, but for the sake of a 5-year old, why not work with the babysitter to find a solution?", "Actually Sandy, it is NOT OP's job to care for your child.
