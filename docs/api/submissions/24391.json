My dad and his wife, Sandy, were attending a wedding last weekend and hired a babysitter for my stepsister Abby (5f). I (16m) was supposed to do it but I work now so they had to hire someone to stay the weekend with Abby.\n\nThe background is simple. Dad and Sandy met 4 years ago. I met her 3 months after my dad did and Abby like a week later. Abby suffers from nightmares pretty frequently. She would always seek someone out at night when she had them, usually her mom, though sometimes me, and I would always send her to her mom. This has been happening since she was 3.\n\nSo my dad and Sandy left Friday afternoon and were gone until Sunday afternoon. Friday night Abby had a nightmare and came to me and asked to sleep in my bed. I sent her back to her room and woke the babysitter who sat with her for a while. Abby was really upset about it and didn't sleep well that night and didn't sleep at all Saturday night. When my dad and Sandy got home they were furious with me for not letting Abby sleep with me.\n\nDad told me he's aware I don't see Abby as my sister but wouldn't I let a small kid sleep with me to help them after a nightmare. I said no. I would not be comfortable with that. He told me it's something I should get comfortable with for Abby's sake, so she can have a good brother to rely on. I told him that was not something I was going to work on. That other than Abby I doubt I will ever be asked by a kid unless that kid is my own and that will be different.\n\nSandy said it was my job to help her kid and that I made last weekend hell for her daughter.\n\nAll week dad and Sandy have been pissed about it. My mom died when I was 6 and I don't have extended family so I haven't been able to talk about this with anyone.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691755462, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o72sd/aita_for_sending_my_stepsister_back_to_her_room/", "score": 1158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe have a mat of some sort that she can lay down on with her pillow and blanket in your room so she can get that comfort temporarily, and then after a while tell her that she need to go back to her bed. You are not the parent in this situation and you are not responsible for watching her.

They are the parents they need to comfort her and deal with their own fallout from being gone. As a kid who had nightmares myself it took my parents saying it isn\u2019t real and forcing me to go back to my room for me to start not having the problem. That being said do not hold resentment against Abby as she is young for your Dad forcing Sandy and abby on you be nice as possible but do not let your father or sandy guilt you into a brotherly role if you don\u2019t want it as you could eventually start to hate the kid. Just be present, respectful, and cordial but if you\u2019re uncomfortable keep reasonable boundaries like this. Maybe with time you\u2019ll begin feeling like she\u2019s your sister but do not force it out of feeling like you owe it to her or the adults.", "YTA.\nLetting a young child alone with their nightmare is plain unkind. Sure enough, you didn't ask to be saddled with a step-sister, but this is your situation right now, and it's not that kid's fault.

I wonder how they were dealt with because you lack empathy for a small child.

But in all of this, there\u2019s a 5 yr old child who didn\u2019t have anyone to comfort her when she needed it", "No judgement from me but it's clear you lack empathy for Abby. It's not your job to take care of her, but telling a scared child to go away in the middle of the night is a bit heartless.

If the stepsister is having nightmares so bad that she can\u2019t sleep, then the parents need to work better at making sure that she is mentally taken care of and that they\u2019re being more attentive to her needs.

He could have given up a few days of comfort to help someone who was struggling with fear, especially since he probably knows what it's like to be scared without a parent to turn to since his mom passed when he was 6. But like we said it's not his \"responsibility\" and he's just a kid too.

They need to figure out a better way to deal with her nightmares, and not blame their lack of planning on the 16-year-old. The girl is five, she will get over it. I bet you, she even forgot it happened at this point. this is not a huge scarring moment for her. Yes, she was scared, and, yes, she was only comforted by a stranger.

But OP losing his sense of space and control, will have a lasting effect On his own psyche and future sense of control, and on his relationship with his parents.

No, we can't be sure that she'll move on so easily from being rejected by her step brother when she didn't have her parents. She's 5 and lots of issues start from a small child's perception of neglect. You don't get to decide which events are trauma to someone else. Again all of this is on the parents and I won't say OP is an asshole but still has lots of room to grow. My point is that a person doesn't have to be assigned a duty to feel for another person and want to comfort them. He didn't feel the need to comfort her, he just wanted the uncomfortable issue out of his room, so to me it appears he lacks empathy.", "This is the hill to die on.

Sticking up for what you believe is appropriate", "NTA. Not only are you allowed to have this boundary just because you don't want to sleep with a kid, I think this is also a prudent safety measure. SA happens a lot, and IMO in blended families it seems to crop up too often - even just the accusations. But I am also in support groups for blended families so that may just be what I'm exposes to most often. \n\nEither way, what if she made an accusation as little kids sometimes do? Bet you that stepmom would not give you the benefit of the doubt there - and realistically, she has to at least take the accusation seriously enough to figure things out.

My parents are also divorced and I also had to adjust to suddenly being a part of a blended family at age 12. I have a bio brother and my stepdad had 2 boys, and I was the oldest.

It is not \"your job.\" There is a big age difference between you and, while hopefully you like her a reasonable amount as a young kid and you're being kind and respectful towards her while also maintaining your own healthy boundaries, it's not reasonable to expect you to love her like a sibling right now. You're dealing with enough trauma in your own right, losing your Mom at age 6 and adjusting to two new people in your home and life as an adolescent, which is a phase that's hard enough for anyone. \n\nThey shouldn't be pushing this if they want to keep you in their lives. Two years is gonna go by before you know it, and you'll be a legal adult who can cut them out of your life if you really want to. You may never see the stepmom or her daughter as family in the same way you do your Dad and your Mom in your heart, and that's okay.

Smh.\n\nHave a calm, rational conversation with your Dad and stepmom about this. The worst mistake teenagers make when they want to argue their case with parents is losing their temper and flying off the handle. That just gives parents more leverage. Stay calm but firm.

I feel like a blanket statement about teen boys is wrong. My teen sons would never molest a child.", "I get what you\u2019re saying bye a 16 yo female would also be well within her rights to say no to this. There\u2019s two issues- one being what you\u2019re talking about and the other just being simply a 16 yo should not be expected to let a kid sleep with them if they don\u2019t feel comfortable.", "She's a 5year old. What if OP was female and it was boy, I personally think it should be fine, but I get where youre coming from.", ">  Unrelated girl child in a teenage boys bed\n\n\nShe's not unrelated. \n\n\n> Do not let that kid in your bedroom at all would be my boundary. Get a lock for that door and tell the parents this is a hill you will die on.\n\n\nThis is bait.", "Came here to say just this. Couldn't agree more.", "Yes. This. This poor kid is damned if he does & damned if he doesn't. What if Abby said something about sleeping with her brother & the stepmom freaked out because she thinks that's inappropriate? I'm glad OP set those boundaries. His dad's reaction is the worst.", "Exactly! That was the subtext I decided not to include because I couldn't think of the best way to phrase it sensitively.", "Yes. Also morning wood  is a thing that I doubt any sane parent wants their 5 year old girl to see or deal with."]}
