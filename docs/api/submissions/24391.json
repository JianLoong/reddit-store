My dad and his wife, Sandy, were attending a wedding last weekend and hired a babysitter for my stepsister Abby (5f). I (16m) was supposed to do it but I work now so they had to hire someone to stay the weekend with Abby.\n\nThe background is simple. Dad and Sandy met 4 years ago. I met her 3 months after my dad did and Abby like a week later. Abby suffers from nightmares pretty frequently. She would always seek someone out at night when she had them, usually her mom, though sometimes me, and I would always send her to her mom. This has been happening since she was 3.\n\nSo my dad and Sandy left Friday afternoon and were gone until Sunday afternoon. Friday night Abby had a nightmare and came to me and asked to sleep in my bed. I sent her back to her room and woke the babysitter who sat with her for a while. Abby was really upset about it and didn't sleep well that night and didn't sleep at all Saturday night. When my dad and Sandy got home they were furious with me for not letting Abby sleep with me.\n\nDad told me he's aware I don't see Abby as my sister but wouldn't I let a small kid sleep with me to help them after a nightmare. I said no. I would not be comfortable with that. He told me it's something I should get comfortable with for Abby's sake, so she can have a good brother to rely on. I told him that was not something I was going to work on. That other than Abby I doubt I will ever be asked by a kid unless that kid is my own and that will be different.\n\nSandy said it was my job to help her kid and that I made last weekend hell for her daughter.\n\nAll week dad and Sandy have been pissed about it. My mom died when I was 6 and I don't have extended family so I haven't been able to talk about this with anyone.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691755462, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o72sd/aita_for_sending_my_stepsister_back_to_her_room/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's good.  \n\n\nAnd it's not like you let Abby just handle it herself, you got her support that she needed by waking the babysitter.", "NTA. You are not the child's parent. If they were so concerned for the wellbeing of their child they would have taken her with them. You didn't make her weekend terrible, and that's a shitty thing to put on you. You should be kind and caring to her as she's a child, but you don't owe her anything beyond that.", "NTA. I would have done the same thing in your shoes at 16.

You are a teenage boy and I think it would be highly inappropriate to have little girl who you are NOT related to in anyway sleep in your bed.\n\nYou should NOT fold on this.  Letting her do this is opening yourself up to accusations that can be life altering for you.  \n\nI'm a mother and I've also done a little bit of training on spotting and reporting abuse.

You should come up with an alternative solution if this comes up in the future and there is no babysitter. Maybe have a mat of some sort that she can lay down on with her pillow and blanket in your room so she can get that comfort temporarily, and then after a while tell her that she need to go back to her bed. You are not the parent in this situation and you are not responsible for watching her. If this was your aunt or uncle babysitting, rather than a paid baby sitter, you wouldn\u2019t have had to change a thing.

Thats not your role in the family and its not your responsibility.\n\nWhat should be happening is that Abby is taken to therapy to work on why she is getting nightmares. OR if its that big of an issue, then your Dad and Sandy should not have gone away or should have taken Abby with them.", "NTA. You told her no, but it isn't like you left her alone and terrified. You did the right thing and woke up the person that your parents hired to watch and care for her for these exact sort of reasons.\n\nNo one can force you to have a relationship with this little girl.

Hold that boundary, friend.", "NTA, while she is now part of your family, the differences in ages makes it weird plus you also work. \n\nSuggest getting her a night light and not have her eat close to bedtime. I had nightmares when I was smaller too, when I woke up I relaxed when seeing light. Also, eating before bed sometimes gives nightmares to certain people, not exactly sure why.", "NTA\n\nStick to your reasons, you did nothing wrong. You are not responsible for someone else kid, because that lies with the parents. Also its inappropriate.", "As long as you were nice about it, NTA, you\u2019re entitled to be comfortable in your own home while sleeping", "NTA. Your stepmother needs to be reminded that her choice to marry your father did not oblige you to be her child's personal therapist and comfort animal. You did not make her daughter's weekend hell. Her nightmares did that. It's her mother's job, and partly her stepfather's, to deal with her nightmares, and drafting a teenage stepson into a role he's uncomfortable with and that is not safe for him is not an appropriate way to deal with things. She made her daughter dependent on her by training her to sleep with her for comfort - she can't then just go off and have fun with her husband and just transfer that dependence to you without your consent. \n\nAlso remind her that a 16-year-old male  sharing a bed with a female child is considered creepy and dangerous by most of the world, and that you do not wish to put yourself in a situation where other people's false impressions could label you with a stigma that could ruin the rest of your life.", "Your parents are AHs\n\nSleeping with your step sister makes you vulnerable to accusation and misunderstandings.\n\nIf you are willing you could ask them to put a mattress on the floor next to her bed if they go away again.\n\nI am so sorry that you are subjected to this injustice.\n\nThey are trying to project their guilt onto you.  They are 2 adults and it must be hard to speak up for yourself.\n\nGood luck.", "Holy shit, you're NTA. Anyone with half an ounce of sense would know asking a teenaged boy to allow a 5 year old girl to sleep in his bed is inappropriate on all the levels. If you have a girlfriend, imagine how her parents would react to that news! Or a school counselor? And who would they blame and make accusations against? You, that's who. \n\nOP, you absolutely did the correct and appropriate thing. Your dad and stepmom need their heads examined. Christ Almighty.", ">Sandy said it was my job to help her kid\n\nBullshit. Even if she was biologically related to you, that would NOT be your \"job.\" If it makes you uncomfortable, they shouldn't be forcing it. \n\nNTA. You have work. School will be starting back up. You don't need your sleep disrupted by a child with nightmares. I feel sorry for the kid. Doesn't mean I'd let her sleep with me.\n\nHave they ever even done anything to find out what is causing it?", "You weren\u2019t comfortable and that should\u2019ve been ok with them your comfort matters too not just the young one\u2019s. They are the parents they need to comfort her and deal with their own fallout from being gone. As a kid who had nightmares myself it took my parents saying it isn\u2019t real and forcing me to go back to my room for me to start not having the problem. That being said do not hold resentment against Abby as she is young for your Dad forcing Sandy and abby on you be nice as possible but do not let your father or sandy guilt you into a brotherly role if you don\u2019t want it as you could eventually start to hate the kid. Just be present, respectful, and cordial but if you\u2019re uncomfortable keep reasonable boundaries like this. Maybe with time you\u2019ll begin feeling like she\u2019s your sister but do not force it out of feeling like you owe it to her or the adults.", "YTA.\nLetting a young child alone with their nightmare is plain unkind. Sure enough, you didn't ask to be saddled with a step-sister, but this is your situation right now, and it's not that kid's fault. If you don't want to see her once your an adult and out of the house, then it's another mater, but right now you are both living in the same home.\nYou didn't have to babysit for the weekend, and that's great, because that's no your job.\nBut taking care of the nightmares of a young children when no one else is available is simply a matter of being a decent being.", "INFO Did you have nightmares as a child? I wonder how they were dealt with because you lack empathy for a small child. That your step sister chose you rather than a babysitter she didn\u2019t feel as comfortable to be with says you make her feel safe. \nI want to say ESH because the way the adults are dealing with it is crap and you can\u2019t force feelings you don\u2019t have. But in all of this, there\u2019s a 5 yr old child who didn\u2019t have anyone to comfort her when she needed it", "No judgement from me but it's clear you lack empathy for Abby. It's not your job to take care of her, but telling a scared child to go away in the middle of the night is a bit heartless. Either way, you're still a child yourself so I can't blame you for avoiding the problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The kid made sure she was taking care of. If the stepsister is having nightmares so bad that she can\u2019t sleep, then the parents need to work better at making sure that she is mentally taken care of and that they\u2019re being more attentive to her needs.

This isn't a matter of parenting but of basic decency.", "I am aware that he is not responsible for watching her. He's still a kid and lacks empathy. She's scared and needed someone she was familiar with, he responded by \"sending her back to her room\" and getting the babysitter (basically a stranger to her), to stay with her. He could have given up a few days of comfort to help someone who was struggling with fear, especially since he probably knows what it's like to be scared without a parent to turn to since his mom passed when he was 6. But like we said it's not his \"responsibility\" and he's just a kid too. I don't expect him to uproot his own life for his step siblings but he couldn't find it in his heart to be uncomfortable for her a few days when she couldn't go to her mother.", "A small child sleeping in your bed is a big inconvenience and if you do it once, you may be expected to do it again. Not his problem", "He shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cfind it in his heart\u201d to be uncomfortable for a few days. I\u2019m sorry, a 16-year-old should be allowed to have the space to himself. I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing for my own brother sister at 16. It\u2019s a parents that have the problem. They need to figure out a better way to deal with her nightmares, and not blame their lack of planning on the 16-year-old. The girl is five, she will get over it. I bet you, she even forgot it happened at this point. this is not a huge scarring moment for her. Yes, she was scared, and, yes, she was only comforted by a stranger. But she\u2019ll move on from this moment. But OP losing his sense of space and control, will have a lasting effect On his own psyche and future sense of control, and on his relationship with his parents. Not allowing her to sleep with him for multiple days in a row is not unempathetic, it is the action after that, that define his empathy.", "Yes, we still agree that it's the parent's job not the 16 year old kid's. No, we can't be sure that she'll move on so easily from being rejected by her step brother when she didn't have her parents. She's 5 and lots of issues start from a small child's perception of neglect. You don't get to decide which events are trauma to someone else. Again all of this is on the parents and I won't say OP is an asshole but still has lots of room to grow. My point is that a person doesn't have to be assigned a duty to feel for another person and want to comfort them. He didn't feel the need to comfort her, he just wanted the uncomfortable issue out of his room, so to me it appears he lacks empathy."]}
