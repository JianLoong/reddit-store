If he had a problem with it, he should've spoken up before.", "Imo, YTA. It's your kids - and your little family's - 1st Xmas and you'd rather be working? Sure the pay would be good, and you get extra holiday time next year, BUT... your son won't remember next year either and again, this is his first one. Family are supposed to be together on Xmas. Period. It'd be one thing if you hated your in-laws and didn't want to go there, but that's not what's happening. Do you, but you'll regret it in the long run.", "NTA \n\nYou're making more money to support your family/child. A 10 month old isn't going to remember you being there. It'll be more important when they're a bit older", "I say NTA as long as you put aside some time to celebrate. I've always been a big believer that the magic of the holiday isn't because it's on December 25th. I do think it's important to do presents, photos, and to start your own traditions, but nothing says it has to all happen on Christmas Day.", "[removed]", "NTA the problem here isn't when you do Christmas, it's that your partner was directly asked and failed to communicate his actual feelings, then got upset with you for not considering them. That sucks. If this was important to him, you would have done it differently. It's why you checked with him and that it mattered you were on the same page. If your relationship is good, I think you guys need to talk about how hurtful it is for you to end up second-guessing yourself after trying very hard to make sure you were aligned. And also about why he didn't say anything, and his feeling disappointed. It might be hard, but it sounds like the fundamental problem here is both of you were hoping to feel connected on something and instead it went sideways, which is a problem that can be fixed with a heartfelt discussion about how you got hurt here.", "NTA, and if your partner intends to stay with you, he needs to get used to unusual holidays.  Certain fields, such as healthcare, journalism, law enforcement, and the military (amongn others) require that **some**one be in the office and working on the holidays.  People still get sick and injured, news still happens, crime happens, and the Commies might pick Christmas Day to land on the beaches and invade the American homeland.  \n\nThe end of the year features three major holidays:  Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.  If you are in one of these professions, you can count on getting the actual holiday off for **one** of these each year.  Maybe two if you are lucky.  \n\nIf your partner can't get used to his, then maybe he needs to spend holidays without you .... permanently.", "NTA, your being practical, responsible, and planning for when the baby can really participate in Christmas. This relationship has more issues than this, just from this little snippet. Good luck with your mamas boy.", "NTA!! \n\nMy son in law works as an Engineer at a Children's Hospital.  He,  too, is working 23-25th. \n\nWe all understood! Even my 8yo granddaughter and my daughter.  Yes,  we were bummed he can't be there (we celebrate 24th), but,  we certainly don't hold any animosity towards him. It's just how his schedule rotated this year.  We figured something out that works for him.  \n\nMy husband is a Firefighter.  If he is called out on a call,  I'm certainly not going to give him grief for leaving the kids and grandchildren to respond. Just go and make sure you come back to us.\n\nPeople who have jobs that don't have Holidays deserve some understanding, and,  definitely not be made to feel guilty.", "NTA.  I am the daughter of a HCW mom and married to a HCW.  Sometimes you have to work. \n\nMany, many times while growing up, my mom would work Christmas. We would celebrate on Christmas Eve as she'd go in for 11pm and work a 12 hour night on the 25/26. (She had a special line to Santa and asked him to deliver gifts early) If she was on days, we'd get up at 5am to open presents before she went to work. Guess, what, my siblings and I turned out fine - and we realized very early on that it was about being together as a family that mattered most. Not which day we celebrated. My kids understand this too now when my partner works part of Christmas.", "NTA. Your partner definitely is though.", "You are right, the baby will not remember or be impacted by your working this Christmas, and you are banking days off for next year, when the child will understand and remember. This seems to be more important to your husband and his family. How are your finances. Do you really need to do this? What ever your decision NTA.", "NTA.

You gave your husband good reasons as to why you decided to work this Christmas so that way next Christmas you can spend even more time with him and your son. It's not like you are abandoning them forever. It's just a few days and you're gonna have an early dinner and present giving. I think he's just used to having his mom home all the time when he was a kid and he wants his kid to have his mom with him even if he won't even remember that day  let alone you being there. You explained your side of it and he just couldn't accept it. That's a problem for him. Don't beat yourself up over it. You will be there for your son next Christmas and the Christmas after that and so on and so forth. You're a good mom. You're doing this for your son and his future.", "NTA!! Your child won't notice in the least, your husband will spend the holidays with his fam, you have arranged a dinner for the three of you. He's a complete AH\nMy fam is celebrating on the 26, so there's my bias. We're not religious, so the day does not matter to us. The 26 allows everyone to be not rushed. There's so much going on between work events and inlaws preferences. I have two kids who will do a traditional dinner with their dad's side of the fam 24. We're all ( kids and adults) happy with this arrangement. I'll have a full day without plans or kids to rest and do yoga- my fam isn't shaming that. You're working to make extra money and ensure next year( when your baby might remember) can have extra time with you", "NTA\u2026 that\u2019s pretty harsh that your partner would whine to his mum about the situation knowing that you have made the decision to work now to have more time with the family later. Let\u2019s be realistic a baby is not aware of what day you celebrate.  In a perfect world we would all be home with our families for the holidays\u2026 but sometimes it\u2019s not possible.", "NTA much better this year than the ones he'll remember", "NTA. Also work in healthcare & have kids. It\u2019s an industry where unfortunately you will not get every Christmas off. As much as people around may not get that you will have to work holidays in the future I think it\u2019s wise to work them when they are young and don\u2019t know better. My kids are 2 & 3. This year the Easter bunny came after nap because I wasn\u2019t home when they were waking up. \nYou adjust to what works best", "NTA! A ten month old is a lovely person who has no concept of holidays. (Even next year she won't. Not really.) You are allowing co-workers to have the holiday moments that you yourself will value in 2-3 years. Please explain to your husband (even though you shouldn't have to) that he is hurting your feelings with this nonsense.", "Do you even have a say in the matter? I'm also a healthcare worker and we don't have a choice. You WILL either be working Christmas or New year's. Every year alternates which one you will work. My mom is also a healthcare worker. Her work you WILL work Christmas AND new year's every other year. Once the schedule is posted, you can try to make switches or give your shift to a casual staff member who isn't working but otherwise you must work those shifts.\n\nMy ex's parents were like this too. They had an issue with me having to work holidays. Definitely NTA", "NTA. Your husband didn\u2019t mind until his mother complained. Instead of sticking up for you, he dropped you in the grease. When you busted him he doubled down. He\u2019s a jerk.", "NTA - as a first responder, I\u2019ve had to work many Christmas and birthdays. It sucks but it goes with the territory and someone has to do it. \nBut\u2026 as someone who has missed out\u2026 I miss the times with family. No amount of OT or extra pay makes up for those special moments. So keep that in mind when you can\u2026 you may regret the precious memories. Although I doubt you\u2019ll regret missing the time with your MOL. \nGood luck!", "It sounds like you're in a job where you'll have to work some holidays, so your plan sounds very practical. Your husband sounds very unsympathetic and unrealistic. If spending holidays together is that important to him, he should voice his needs to you and not grumble to his mother. You're doing your very best, and he seems unappreciative.", "NTA. You work in healthcare. I assume at a 24 hour facility and/or hospitalized patients.  Working holidays is part of the job. My hospital has us rotate the holidays so the same people don\u2019t get stuck working year after year.", "I've worked in Healthcare for the past 12 years.  Our family believes it is more about spending time with each other than the day.  I work Christmas and Christmas eve.  Our Christmas will be on the 27th this year.\n\nSounds like you had a great plan for Christmas this year and next.\n\n\nNTA", "So only the single or childless nurses and doctors supposed to work on Christmas?

And it's a hospital your never going to get every Christmas off so may aswell work around it while it's so easily done.", "They're single, they can work. She has a child and it's his 1st Xmas.
