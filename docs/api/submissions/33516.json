If your relationship is good, I think you guys need to talk about how hurtful it is for you to end up second-guessing yourself after trying very hard to make sure you were aligned. And also about why he didn't say anything, and his feeling disappointed.

I understand your husband is disappointed not to be able to spend it with you, but surely he is an adult who can recognize the necessity.

First, the kid won\u2019t remember this Christmas. It\u2019s just another day for them.  Second, my MIL was an ER nurse (as is her daughter).  It was very common for  her to work Christmas for this exact reason (so their family tradition was stuff on X-mas eve, not the 25th).  MIL is losing the forest through the trees and prescribing her own beliefs to others", "NTA actually I would be like yeah, you\u2019re right, I would miss my baby too much. You guys will have to stay home as I am required to work and I can see baby while I\u2019m awake either before or after work. Thanks for making me realize I was wrong for thinking you\u2019d have a more enjoyable time with your family who doesn\u2019t have to work over the holidays.", "NTA: Working holidays for extra pay and additional time off is a smart financial decision. Christmas doesn\u2019t have to be celebrated on a specific day!\n\nYour coworkers will appreciate you working this year and will help you out in the future so you can spend the holidays with your family. \n\nMy dad was a physician and a few Christmases he had to leave for an emergency. You are NOT a bad Mom at all!", "I understand your point that your baby won\u2019t know or remember. But the rest of your family knows and will remember.\n\nIt sounds like your husband agreed to not argue with you but is a bit hurt by it. \n\nBut still, you\u2019re not an AH. You\u2019re just trying to make extra money for your family.", "My mother worked every Christmas until she retired and we still had all the celebrations. \n\nI\u2019d like to know about these so-called state laws that mandated mothers had to quit jobs to stay home to raise children. *That* sounds like a really big fricking lie!", "NTA. My dad was a security officer and often took holiday shifts so his employees could be with their families because I was often with my mom (they\u2019re divorced). It didn\u2019t make holidays any less special. They just happened at a different time and I admire his dedication and generosity to his coworkers.", "NTA. If Christmas is to celebrate the birth of Jesus, no one even does that on the correct day.", "NTA - Your baby is not old enough to know one day from another. You came up with a plan to get higher pay to provide for the family,*and your partner agreed.* It's reasonable to want you all to share your baby's first Christmas together, but he had a responsibility to voice his opinion and have a discussion about it. Instead he ran to Mommy to whine about what a bad mother you are. You are not a bad mother, but he is being a bad partner right now.", "NTA! \n\nLots of families move Christmas around. Healthcare is renown for Santa catching their houses a bit early or a couple days later.  Your child is 10 months old. Every day is the best day ever for the baby, and having extra holiday time available and extra money is a great decision for your family. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone should get more attached to the calendar day than to their actual, living breathing family. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your husband is a butthead here. I hope the two of you can get some good talking in and he can figure out his feelings.", "NTA, babes are babes. Is hubs being influenced by his mom? Dif generation, or he is insecure of being alone w babe? Either  way, no guilt , if you trust them w babe, you're fine", "NTA  \nI think you're being very smart. Your baby isn't going to have a clue that it's Christmas or what Christmas is. Next year will be a bit more fun and the year after that will be even better. Bank those days so you can enjoy the holidays when he's a bit more aware.   \nYour husband needs to apologize to you and defend you to his mother.", "NTA\n\nGo to work. That way you'll avoid any arguments on Xmas day. Which are now more likely since you heard your partner's comments.", "NTA. \n\nMy husband has worked almost every holiday we have had children for. We have always adjusted our family celebration to fit his time when he is home. We keep in very matter of fact. When the kids were young it meant sometimes Santa visited a different night (they didn\u2019t pay attention to the date really). By the time they understood the dates they understood we were waiting for dad to be home to celebrate/open presents. We did fun activities in the morning while we waited. They are all teens/adults now and there are no hard feelings over how we celebrated. And it has kept our traditions very flexible as they are starting adult relationships that involve spending time with the SO\u2019s family over holidays we are already used to moving holiday celebrations to fit everyone\u2019s schedule", "NTA. If he was not onboard with the idea when it came up, he should have said something. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that he was OK enough with it at first, but then grew into being more disappointed as the reality settled in. \n\nYour MIL needs to keep her criticism to herself.", "INFO: You word this as though this was your idea because you say you suggested that you work this Christmas, not that you told him you were scheduled this Christmas. So was this voluntary to work those days or not? You're presenting this like this was your idea to not be around for Christmas.", "Not at all\n\nyour baby won't even remember it's first two Christmases!\n\nI'd wait until the wonder of the season actually means something to them at a point they will remember!\n\nyou can ask any kid what they remember from their first Christmas and they probably will tell you about the one from when they turned either 3 or 4 and not from when they were a baby!\n\nthey would only know what their first Christmas was like from pictures and whatever stories came out of it!", "NTA. I worked in hotel management for years, and some of that was at a small but very busy hotel. I always decided to work the front desk alone on either Thanksgiving evening or Christmas morning so that my employees could have the holiday off. \n\nI didn\u2019t have to work any holidays; I was a manager. I did what I thought was fair because every single person who worked there had a family, but we all chose to work in an industry that was 24/7/365 (including me).  \n\nI had a baby during my time there. I spent his first Christmas at work, and his second Thanksgiving at work, but we didn\u2019t miss them: we just moved them to another day. He had absolutely no concept of dates, and the date wasn\u2019t special to him *or* to me: the DAY was special. We had that day every year that I worked there, although it might not have been on the same date that most people celebrate. \n\nIt sounds like you fully planned to do that. You weren\u2019t planning on spending Christmas away from your baby: you were planning on spending December 25th away from him after having your Christmas. \n\nShame on your husband for making you feel bad about something that I know is a difficult decision to make anyway. His mother sounds like a judgmental bully, and it sounds like he\u2019s not willing to stand up to her for you. I\u2019m sorry about that. \n\nYou have no reason to feel bad about working on the 25th. Spend your Christmas with your son; your husband can join if he chooses to apologize and behave himself better.", "NTA - baby is too young to know what's going on.", "No, your kid isn\u2019t going to have much of a concept of time for a few years. My kid is three and anything in the past is yesterday. Your has no idea what day Christmas actually falls on and will only remember the quality time he spends with you.", "NTA- as if your baby knows what day Christmas falls on! At 10 months old he doesn't care! At all! You can dress him up and put out presents any day and take pics. Your husband and his mom are both mealy mouthed assholes!", "One should ask if OP\u2019s husband is upset she\u2019s not going to be spending time with the family or (more likely) upset that he now has to be the main carer of the child over the break? Either way OP you are NTA for working to bring in good money over this period! Hubby and his mother are both AHs!", "Ohhh, adult holidays with children.  Probably more trouble than they're worth.\n\nBut the partner thinks this is about him and he isn't being considered.  Either he didn't communicate his feelings to you or you didn't listen.  You're absolutely right about the baby.  He couldn't care less. I'm going with NAH even though your partner needed his mom's push to tell you how he really feels.", "NTA\n\nThe problem here is that you work in healthcare and it is inevitable that you will have to work a Christmas and New Years occasionally.  You were trying to pick and choose which Christmas **not if** a Christmas.  Your husband needs to understand the reality of your chosen profession. \n\nPeople are sick and in need of care and attention 24 hours a day 365 days of the year.  Illness does not care what day it is. \n\nYour husband and his family need to understand this.", "Where/when was it mandated by law that women had to leave their jobs after marriage??? That's wild. \n\nYou are NTA. Christmas is just a day. Your baby won't remember, your husband completely failed to communicate his feelings on the subject, and christmas is just a day anyway. You can celebrate it whenever you want.", "NTA.\n\nPeople don't stop needing care or being sick because it is (insert holiday / birthday here). \n\nI assume since you are married that your hubby has likely seen you work a holiday before (unless this is your first year in healthcare).  \n\nTell MIL to stay out of it.  You will need to work holidays, perhaps by working this one you can have the next one off. \n\nI work in health care, I spent years working all the holidays before I had kids so other parents could have it off.   Pick a day and celebrate does not need to be the 25th.", "NTA. When I was a kid - many many years ago - we had Christmas at all sorts of different times to accomidate family all over the place. The point is you are a family - not what day you celebrate on. You are not missing out, you are working it out.", "NTA the kind of mother who is smartly at work making double pay that's what kind of mother. How dare she insults someone who is supporting their family. The actual day does not mean much to a kid. they will remember the quality of time that you spent and not did we celebrate something on the correct day.", "NTA - It's obvious that you are sacrificing for your family.  I'm betting if the roles were reversed your MIL would understand that your husband working Christmas was the best for everyone.  To be clear though, your husband is the real AH here for not having your back.", "NTA. You are in HEALTHCARE. You are going to have to work holiday\u2019s sometimes! That\u2019s how it works! Did he think it would magically stop when you had a baby?? You are right, better to work this one now and then have one off when your baby is older .", "NTA\nYou aren't a bad mother. Your child does not know what day it is, so they literally couldn't care less.  Yourself and your partner do need to work on yojr communicatiom though because if he had been upfront in the first place you wouldn't be carrying this guilt now.", "Yeah my dad was a healthcare worker and growing up he had to work every other Christmas so we got used to being flexible and doing our family celebrations on a different day if we needed to. Was not a big deal. Just part of life", "From a paramedic who will be working on Christmas, this is the take.", "Also in healthcare, you don\u2019t get every holiday off! It wouldn\u2019t be fair if everyone was trying to get every holiday off. It would end up with only the senior staff getting it off for \u201cfirst dibs\u201d. You get assigned your holidays to work and then your family just has to get along without you. If you can find someone who doesn\u2019t care about that particular holiday or needs the holiday pay, then you switch. It\u2019s smart to gather up favors now while they\u2019re little! I sincerely doubt at this point you could get out of your shifts, it\u2019s far too close. So work on your communication, maybe see a marriage counselor? Then next year, perhaps you will get to spend Christmas together. NTA", "Zookeeper here still getting family asking if the facility is open on a holiday. Doesn't affect my job if it is or isn't.

Do the sweet things with your baby. Santa pics, stockings, snuggles in cute matching pjs, whatever is important to you, do it.

My family is notorious for celebrating holidays with the same traditions every year but usually shifted a day or two before or after the actual day.", "I used to be very popular at jobs since I *preferred* working holidays.
