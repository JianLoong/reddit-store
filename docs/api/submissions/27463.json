Your son can't \"decide for himself\" whether to be mistreated as a young child. It's your job to protect him. Make an effort to video or otherwise document everything your in-laws do, for future evidence. (You really should've addressed this before having a child, but it's too late to fix that.)", "ESH. If what you say about your in-laws is true, they're terrible people and your wife is wrong to make excuses for them (even though they're her parents). But your post makes it clear that you've known what they're like for years, so your ongoing relationship with them is something you should have talked about with your wife before marrying her, and **really** should have talked about before having a child with her.", "NTA for *wanting* to protect your son, but Y-T-A for waiting until it's too late to do it.  That's her baby, too, and the only way to keep your children safe from their grandparents was to have these conversations before you ever conceived.  Good luck, you've got eighteen years of fighting this battle.  Less time, hopefully, if your in-laws wind up hurting your son bad enough to break your wife out of her mommy and daddy's spell before then.", "Cameras in your living areas and  nursery so you can see whats happening while you are at work. If they do harm your infant then its  straight to your lawyer and restraining order. Marital counselling may help your wife see through the emotional fog surrounding her parents. Your concerns are real and its your job to.protect your child from all who pose a risk  even indirectly.", "ESH. This is something you should have figured out and resolved way before you had the baby.", "Look, it sounds like you're afraid you FIL will verbally abusing your child. Thats very serious stuff and it sounds like you have evidence to support your fears. I would become very violent towards any individual yelling in the face of any of my children, let alone a toddler.\n\nI think the best course of action is to have a family meeting and discuss it with them. Talking things out is almost always the best way to handle stuff like this.", "Why can\u2019t we you just make all visits supervised ones?", "INFO: Did you two discuss this before having a child? At the risk of sounding overly judgemental, I don't understand why you two would proceed knowing full well that this was a genuine issue for both of you for different reasons.", "too late let your kid decide when he's older \nif it's that taxing on you, time to have a talk", "NTA but you should have had this discussion prior to having a child.\n\nYou knew this would be a possibility (ILs in the babys life) but proceeded to have a child anyway. Now you have to deal with the consequences of that decision. That's not just your baby, that's both you baby. Now you have to learn to deal with making joint decisions", "Y T A \n\nFor having a child with your wife and not having this settled beforehand.\n\nYes her parents sound toxic and abusive but she can't see it. So she is destined to continue her generational trauma...... With this child. That's what letting him 'decide for himself when he's old enough ' means. He will already have learned (insert any horrible personality traits) to navigate life. Poor kiddo.\n\nI see this marriage going down the sh!tter over parenting, if you don't get into couples councilling. If what you wrote is true, at the very least you need to set some very firm, if A then B, boundaries with your wife in regards to her parents.\n\nNTA", "YTA for thinking that you are able to make a unilateral decision like this.\n\nThat's just not how things work.  It is not your child.  It is BOTH of your children.  And it's obvious that this is something you should have discussed ahead of time.  \n\n> Idk what to do and this is putting a lot of strain on my marriage\n\nYes, and realize that there is a good chance this could end in divorce/separation.  Not wanting the ILs in the child's life at all - when your wife wants:\n\n> She wants them to be fully involved, babysitting, asking for advice, you name it.\n\nMeans you also want them out of your wife's life.  That's alienation.  Again, maybe they are toxic.  But this should have been a discussion prior to having a child / getting married.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From what you describe, your in-laws sound unstable and could be dangerous for your son.\n\nSo your wife wants him to have a relationship with them ? Fine. He can visit them with you and you only. They don't need to babysit. If she wants advice, they can give it to her. If she does something you don't approve of with the baby, you have a say. You're the father.\n\nI advise you to compromise and visit her parents from time to time with your son to have peace, so you can stay close to him and protect him.\n\nNTA", "This should have been a conversation a long time ago, but here you all are!  No one sucks here, but a serious sit down and ground rules conversation needs to happen, quite possibly with a mediator.  She loves her parents and wants them involved in their grandchilds life and that's normal, but she needs to respect the \"no parenting\" boundary you have in place.   Then, a conversation with the grandparents!!  A sticky situation and good luck to you!", "NTA for wanting to protect your child, but you should have had this conversation before the baby was born.  \n\nYour wife wants her parents involved in her kids life, and that is understandable.  So compromise by always having one of you around when they are with your son.  If you see any sign of abuse (yelling or manipulation, etc) then bring it up to your wife immediately.\n\nYou two may want to go to marriage counseling for some advice, because this is going to be a serious issue for the duration of your marriage.", "INFO. Would it be possible for the two of you to talk this through in therapy/mediation? It sounds like the place for this? It\u2019s a really important topic, and the longer you go about handling this situation in the manner you describe, the worse it sounds like it\u2019s going to get in your relationship as well as extended family.", "R/justnomil is the sub for you my friend.", "ESH\n\nThis mess was an ongoing issue that you chose to ignore. You know that your wife, who probably needs therapy,  cannot keep away from her parents, why on earth would you believe she would exclude them from your baby's life, if she can't exclude them from hers? Why did you assume that everything would magically fix afterward?\n\nI am worried about the physical confrontation you mentioned, and I would suggest that this better be your hill to die on, but now any choice seems condemned. Your wife will not cut them off, and if you two divorce, then it will be even harder to have any control over the situation\n\nAre you in the same state? Because you mentioned you moved", "NTA  It sounds like you want to prevent people being around your child who have been abusive to their kids and other people's kids in the past.\n\nIf you wife takes your kid around them anyway and they are abused by the grandparents, divorce your wife and sue for full custody using your wife's enabling of the abuse as evidence of her being an unfit mother.\n\nIt probably won't work in court, since mothers have to be serial killers to lose custody, but you should give it your best shot.\n\nGood luck.  Keep your child as safe as you can.", "NTA- sounds like a give an inch take a mile situation. You\u2019re not willing to test this given what you observed- understandably.\n\nReminding your wife about why she went NC/LC is reasonable and taking every precaution to protect your family should be the only priority.", "Yeah it's been a consistent issue for the duration of the relationship. It's like a repeating cycle of her going NC, them coming up with some sob story or excuse, and her falling for it every time. They even moved and pressured her pregnant sister to move closer to us when we moved to a different state.\n\nI really thought that she'd get it by now, that she would put what's best for the baby first above all else, but I guess I never considered she'd think having them in his life would be for the best", "That would be a reasonable compromise, but OP says his wife wants to allow them to babysit.", "We talked about but the pregnancy itself was unplanned and we decided to keep it. We have had issues with her parents in the past, usually we will go no contact for a few months before her sister or a Facebook message, or in one case her family moving states to be close to us, will break that and she'll swear up and down that this time it's different and they've changed.\n\n\nThe pregnancy itself was fine, it wasn't until the last month of the pregnancy that her family made a big deal about wanting to reconnect. That is what pushed me into suggestin counseling", "We are currently in couples counseling and she is seeing a therapist herself.  It's been rough going, even the counsellor has gotten frustrated at times though she'd never admit it. I love my wife. I want to work through this, we have before, but her family always pops back into our lives and she immediately reverts to being compliant and non-confrontational towards them, but the opposite on their behalf.", "Your wife is being very selfish.  Maybe give her some literature on what exposure to her parents will do to your son's neurological *and* social-emotional development.  Children thrive with gentleness, and they suffer in ways both seen and unseen when they get (for example) screamed at for singing."]}
