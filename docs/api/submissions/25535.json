I give the benefit of the doubt that she means well but to be blunt, she's not important to our family. Therefore this whole thing is none of her business.

(Kids routinely celebrate bdays with their class & teacher) A polite \u201cno thank you\u201d is fine. Your son can never have too many people in his life who care about & support him.\n\nEdit judgment\u2014NAH", "As a teacher she's probably seen dozens and dozens of foster children that are never loved or cared for. It probably breaks her heart.\n\nSo she's *very* excited to see Xander in such a loving household where he's being adopted into the family. She's excited and wants to be a part of it.\n\nBut I get that you guys don't want it to be a big event.\n\nThis is a rare \"nobody at all is the asshole here\".", "\"It's very thoughtful that you want to acknowledge my child's life event, but it's actually a bad message. You don't realize this because you just met him a few weeks ago, but we've been father and son for quite a while now. Going to court to legally formalize it is a hassle, not a special moment: highlighting it with extra attention will only serve to emphasize that strangers think we weren't really a family before. The last thing I would want is for you to spoil your relationship with him by making this a bigger deal than *he* wants it to be.\"\n\nNTA, but I would encourage you to come up with better talking points. Her impulses seemed like someone who wanted to celebrate your son, which is why she kept trying. If so, she might *still* try to do something like organize a class \"adoption card\" or otherwise encouraging the class to do something to acknowledge your son's adoption (if she can convince herself that she made it \"not about her\")\n\nI would also keep an eye on the situation... It's early enough in the school year that you could have your son switch to another teacher if this one can't keep to appropriate boundaries.", "NTA. I'm a teacher. If I was privileged to know this info, I would certainly acknowledge it with a congratulations email, but that's it. Boundaries are good things.", "Esh. Did you actually say that she was making it about herself? That was probably uncalled for and unnecessary. I get you want to keep it low key, and you didn't like her making a fuss. But her intentions were not bad. I think you should have asked your child if they wanted a party before unilaterally turning it down. People don't always handle adoption in the most tactful way but you have to look at someone's intention or you are going to be spending years getting angry at people. \n\n\n Maybe they want to celebrate with their friends. I'm a former adoption worker with children from foster care and it's extremely common for people to celebrate afterwards and to mark the occasion every year with a celebration. As a teacher she's probably been to adoptions like this before. It wasn't uncommon for teachers, friends, and a bunch of other people in the child's life showing up for the hearing. Her asking was not inappropriate from my experience. Teacher's are encouraged to do stuff like that. She sounds like a good teacher. If you didn't want anyone but family you needed to come up with a more tactful reply. Saying you are just trying to keep it to immediate family but you appreciate her offering to be there.", "NTA\n\nThis is not appropriate for a school setting, IMO.\n\nWhat about other children who may be fostered who are in the classroom?  \n\nIt just rubs me wrong that the class would celebrate this.  It is a family thing.", "NTA\n\nHer insistence sounds like she's trying to virtue signal, honestly. She's put it in her head that Xander needs support when there's no reason to even think that, like wtf?", "NTA. As a teacher I would have said \u201ccongratulations, that\u2019s great news\u201d and that\u2019s about it.", "NTA she should\u2019ve read the room on your first response. Her hurt feelings are her own deal.", "Apparently, AITA is coming for the teachers today.\n\nTelling her not to acknowledge it is fine: It's a well-intentioned gesture on her part, but not what you want.\n\nTelling her she's not important is seriously misguided: he's 7. You do your son a massive disservice by insulting his teacher. He spends all day with her 5 days a week. Teachers are massively important in kids' lives. She's still getting to know him, and you, because it's the beginning of the year. Give her a break. YTA.", "NTA. Its a private family event. Also, I agree that your kid should be made to feel that he\u2019s always been your kid and this is just a little technicality in your life - no need to make a big deal about it.", "ESH She needs to respect the boundaries you set, but there's no reason to accuse her of an ulterior motive. \n\nShe's a second grade teacher, she is probably just a halpy person and wants to use opportunities to have her students practice inclusiveness and diversity. Maybe she has some personal experience with the foster system and knows how important a strong support system is. \n\nYou can give a firm no without judgements and accusations.", "I am caught her not sure if your an AH or not.\n\nTo be fair the teacher was trying to do something nice for you and Xander.", "YTA. You assign her such nefarious intentions.. NTA for saying no, but your defenitely the AH for how you spoke to her and how you speak about her here. She wasn't making it about her, she just thought it was a happy occasion and wanted to celebrate it for him.\n\nInstead of being happy your teacher care above and beyond for their students, you treat her so horribly.\n\nAlso I think you make a lot of decision for your son and make a lot of assumptions about him. You should have told her you would ask him and give her his answer. You say he's nonchalant - but for a kid to go to court can feel very exciting and special, even if he doesn't show it. Also people can be nonchalant about important mile stones, and still want to celebrate it, because it's fun.\n\n'and our court date isn't going to change our daily life.' - and birthday is going to change his life? Still teachers celebrate their student's birthdays. All celebrations teacher do for kids are about tiny things that happen to tiny kids. That's what they do. It's not about the thing, it's about the kid.\n\nMaybe the teacher thought you don't want to celebrate with the kids, because you don't necessarily need to publish it to everyone, so she suggested a smaller celebration just with a gift from the teacher, since she's already in the loop. And then you came out at her.\n\nSo for me YTA,", "You both seem pretty insufferable tbh - ESH", "NTA\n\n This isn't about her at all.", "NTA, but you could have phrased it better. It\u2019s not that your teacher isn\u2019t important to your child (she likely is), it\u2019s that you don\u2019t want to make the adoption into a big deal for your child.", "NTA: she sounds like the sort of person who would brag that some of her best friends are black.", "NTA (but kinda are at the same time). I myself am highly family-centric and if you are not part of my family then you can F-off but there is simply no such thing as too much positive support of a child, especially one in a situation like foster care. It would be/have been better to let the child decide if HE wanted the party or for his teacher to be that involved.", "Wow, your cold", "NTA - It\u2019s a family matter and he is your child -. She wants to be involved, but it is over stepping a boundary for you. I do think it as nice of the teacher. You kindly declined, she will get over it.", "NTA. Your son needs to process this with just the few of you who really matter. We had an adoption ceremony in our family recently. The adoptive father and his parents had loved my 5 yo g'son from his infancy, and we all considered each other family, but the proceedings were especially important to them\u2014this would be their only grandchild and they were thrilled that it would be legal.  At the judges behest, the new g'parents spoke briefly \u2014husband and I were asked to speak also but we are keeners who will weep like banshees at the drop of a hat, so I waived that off\u2014nonetheless, all the adults, including the lawyer and judge, cried. G'son himself just walked around the courtroom with a box of tissues he picked up from the judge's desk saying, \"why is everyone's eyes red?\" That little ceremony was enough\u2014he did not need a big deal being made by anyone outside of our little family.", "NTA - I don\u2019t fault her for asking, but it is a private family event and she should have left it at that.", "NTA, she was trying to butt in on a family thing.", " NTA - in fact I would go to the principal and suggest adoption education training for the teachers. She\u2019s practicing saviorism. And that sucks.", "ESH, you could\u2019ve said no without telling her that she isn\u2019t important.", "YTA for how you said it and your general attitude towards his teacher. You could have more politely declined as she clearly is passionate about teaching and well-meaning. Your response was unnecessarily cruel.", "YTA.", "People worried about being humble because they are worried about being judged is going to be a problem in the future. IMO, the worst is when you're a middle-aged to boomer aged person talking about people celebrating their achievements as if those people didn't deserve to celebrate them because they were being too loud and proud about it. \n\nIf the adoption is transactional to you, it's okay to not celebrate and make it a big deal, but I say YTA because of how you turned down the teacher. She may just be a very kind person wanting to celebrate a big day for one of her beloved kids. I hope you don't raise Xander to be mean like that.  You could have said that you didn't want to make it a big deal so that Xander didn't think he was any different from his classmates, but in actuality you made it about you not wanting clout or whatever. That word of the year is so overused, like snowflake, humble brag, etc....", "NAH.

She wasn't trying to be mean or anything, and I think you could've just explained that this was a family-only event, and that Xander really didn't want to make a big thing of it.", "All of this could have been avoided if you would have simply stated that your child would not be in class...full stop.

Good for you for shutting that down. NTA", "NTA - I understand the teacher's fascination because fostering and adoption are relatively uncommon. The request to do a class celebration was reasonable; it's also nice to see that she asked for permission rather than just doing it. If everything stopped there, I would have had a totally different opinion.\n\nAsking to come to court was weird. I understand the interest since so few people in the population would see that kind of event, but asking if she could come to the proceeding feels like asking if she could be in the delivery room for a baby being born; everyone would agree that is creepy as hell. \n\nWhile your response may have been harsh, what your family wants is reasonable which is to treat the adoption as a legal formalization of something already true, Xander is part of your family.", "Is there a \"no one is the anus here\" option?\n\nThe teacher just didn't expect you to say that. No one is in the wrong here.", "NTA.\nAs as an educator and an ex LAC, this teacher has stepped into strange territory and is overstepping. It's entirely normal to feel excited about a child being adopted, it's perhaps normal -if you had an extensively close relationship with the child AND parent- to get a card and a commemorative gift, but I absolutely agree with you, she's doing everything possible to make it about her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We\u2019re not second graders at the start of a new school year, whose lives have included family court, guardian ad litem visits, court appointed attorney visits, social workers, interactionals (psychological assessments of family dynamic) \u2026 not being interrupted anymore is a huge step in this child\u2019s life.", "It's in the afternoon so what's the point in having him home when he could get a few hours of instruction time?", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being downvoted", "How do you differentiate between not the asshole (NTA) and no one is the asshole (NTA)?", "Fair enough. You\u2019re NTA in this situation - it\u2019s kinda weird that she asked & pushed it? Good on you for being honest.", "Yes, family-related or personal things never are celebrated with community. That's why kids never experience things like bar mitzvahs or birthdays with anyone ever other than family. \n\nWink, wink.", "I would have phrased it as \u201cthis is a family only event\u201d.", "So I think that\u2019s the problem. People that aren\u2019t educated about adoption like to treat adoptive parents as saviors and that act of adoption as events. \n\nI\u2019m guessing she\u2019s seen Facebook posts of a kid being adopted with their entire class being in court with them. \n\nNTA. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s trying to make it about her. I think she\u2019s ignorantly making your son a commodity because that\u2019s how the media treats adoption. Maybe direct her to some adoption education resources so she can better understand how to interact with your son. I\u2019d be concerned about what she says to him in the classroom.", "It\u2019s totally normal for teachers to celebrate life events with children and their families. If you\u2019d like to keep it private, that\u2019s your right but the teacher wasn\u2019t trying to steal attention and frankly I think it\u2019s odd that you\u2019d accuse them of this. They are trying to support your child. You should feel lucky that your child has an involved and supportive teacher. You didn\u2019t need to be a jerk about it - you could have politely said that you\u2019d like to keep it private and would not like a class celebration", "I read this as it\u2019s more about you & your vision of how you would prefer to keep this event low key. Totally fine as long as your son has the same vision. He\u2019s 7 .... \n\n7 year olds like to be the center of attention & celebrate with their friends. Not the worst thing in the world for people to want to make your son feel special & loved on a special day.", "Who hurt YOU", "Sure, but if your son came up to you and he said he wanted to have a party or cele rate it with his friends in some way, would you turn him down?", "YTA - dodging the question means you haven\u2019t asked your son, the only person whose opinion matters.\n\nShe\u2019s \u201cnot important to your family\u201d but they spend most of their waking hours in the same room, assuming she\u2019s his only teacher.", "That's fine - there's zero reason to infer there's bad intentions like OP was, though.", "Maybe the kid doesn't have big emotions about it. Like OP said, nothing is changing in his life, he'll still be living with the same person / people he's lived with for most if not all of his memories. Even if he's told it means he gets a permanent parent, he probably never really thought about legalities of foster kids and court ordered custody. He lives with OP, he'll still live with OP, court and adoption papers are adult stuff that he probably doesn't care about besides being told OP will always be dad now but might not have before according to reasons he doesn't fully understand.", "100% agreed with this. People calling the teacher an AH are ridiculous and seriously lack empathy.", "Teacher asked *to go to court* and *bring a gift*.\n\nUnless you\u2019re being asked to testify, especially if a parent says no to the class party, the next statement shouldn\u2019t be \u201cbut I want to go to court with you!\u201d", "NTA - Not The Ah\n\nNAH - No Ah Here\n\nESH - Everyone Sucks Here\n\nYTA - You\u2019re The Ah", "I have an adopted 7 year old. He hates it when people mention that he must be. He would hate his class celebrating something that is personally traumatizing to himself.", "Not all 7 year olds", "Every kid in class has a birthday, not every kid in class is adopted.\n\nI don't doubt the teacher has good intentions, but ultimately the kid could feel singled out by making the adoption a big deal and I think the parent is the one best able to judge the situation.\n\nKids want to be celebrated, sure, but they also really want to fit in at that age. He can still get the birthday shenanigans like everyone else.", "I don't think the teacher did a great job handing it and I've said that. But OP could have been more tactful especially since that she will likely be his teacher for the next 9 months and now things are akward. Reddit is big on these unapologetic stances but forgetting people have to find a way to interact with others who are also fallible with feelings off their own. And to play devil's advocate the teacher may have said that because she wanted to ensure the parent she wasn't coming because she felt her job dictated she be there. She over stepped surd but it wasn't malicious. I'm done responding to you I've said my peace.", "Thanx", "Parents always have the final say. There\u2019s nothing in this post about how the 7 yo feels about this day.\n\nHonestly the thing that kind of makes me think OP has not really thought about his kid\u2019s experience.... \u201che knows he belongs to me\u201d .... that just rubs me the wrong way.", "And I have seen a few videos where the adoption is made into a celebration, even with all the classmates being in the courtroom. \n\nAll kids are different. Of course I am hoping OP knows his kid more than the teacher who has had him in her class for a couple of weeks.", "This would have been a nightmare for me.", "We only OP\u2019s vision for the day ... to keep it private. It\u2019s hard to know what exactly this teacher\u2019s goal is without knowing what the 7 yo is reporting.\n\nHaving spent many years in first/second grade classrooms. Kids tend to get pretty excited about big events in their life (new babies, bday, grandma & grandpa visits) & they often don\u2019t stop talking about it! No one knows how the 7 yo feels about this day. Hopefully, he\u2019s not disappointed by the lack of acknowledgement.\n\nAs a mom of 4 (now adults) it\u2019s always the parents decision of what is in the best interest of their kids. Personally, I have never been offended by anyone wanting to celebrate & support my kids. If my kids don\u2019t want to celebrate, that\u2019s totally fine. I certainly would not have responded in the same way OP did though. That was an overreaction imo.", "As someone who was a kid once and had an unusual family situation compared to everyone else, I *hated* the attention that brought me. OP mentioned kid's nonchalant about the adoption, I understood that to mean he already felt like this was his family before the adoption happened.\n\nI do feel OP could have been a bit more tactful, but honestly, I kinda get that he wanted to shut this down for good after already having made clear he doesn't want the school involved. For a teacher to try to invite themselves to adoption proceedings is overstepping even if it's coming from a good place.", "Well OP certainly knows his child better than anyone here.\n\nI just don\u2019t see this as an egregious attempt to do any harm. Think the teacher reacted like most caring people would \u201cwhat can I do to show support for your family\u201d. A simple & polite \u201cthank you for your kind offer however we are keeping this very low key & private\u201d would have been fine.\n\nI do think it\u2019s strange that teacher would offer to attend court just because the kid \u201cis cutest in the class\u201d. That makes zero sense. I suspect there\u2019s a different reason.", "I would suspect she\u2019s trying to recreate Facebook posts she\u2019s seen.", "That part. It's 100% OK for this to be a a family event and not wanting something more public, assuming there's any ill will or intentions, though, seems a bit much.", "I'd believe it; teacher may think it's a \"think\" to do."]}
