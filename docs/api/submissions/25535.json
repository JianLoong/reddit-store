Seems to me like that\u2019s the most important piece of this puzzle.\n\nIt\u2019s not offensive that your son\u2019s teacher wanted to share in celebrating your son\u2019s life event. (Kids routinely celebrate bdays with their class & teacher) A polite \u201cno thank you\u201d is fine. Your son can never have too many people in his life who care about & support him.\n\nEdit judgment\u2014NAH", "As a teacher she's probably seen dozens and dozens of foster children that are never loved or cared for. It probably breaks her heart.\n\nSo she's *very* excited to see Xander in such a loving household where he's being adopted into the family. She's excited and wants to be a part of it.\n\nBut I get that you guys don't want it to be a big event.\n\nThis is a rare \"nobody at all is the asshole here\".", "\"It's very thoughtful that you want to acknowledge my child's life event, but it's actually a bad message. You don't realize this because you just met him a few weeks ago, but we've been father and son for quite a while now. Going to court to legally formalize it is a hassle, not a special moment: highlighting it with extra attention will only serve to emphasize that strangers think we weren't really a family before. The last thing I would want is for you to spoil your relationship with him by making this a bigger deal than *he* wants it to be.\"\n\nNTA, but I would encourage you to come up with better talking points. Her impulses seemed like someone who wanted to celebrate your son, which is why she kept trying. If so, she might *still* try to do something like organize a class \"adoption card\" or otherwise encouraging the class to do something to acknowledge your son's adoption (if she can convince herself that she made it \"not about her\")\n\nI would also keep an eye on the situation... It's early enough in the school year that you could have your son switch to another teacher if this one can't keep to appropriate boundaries.", "NTA. I'm a teacher. If I was privileged to know this info, I would certainly acknowledge it with a congratulations email, but that's it. Boundaries are good things.", "Esh. Did you actually say that she was making it about herself? That was probably uncalled for and unnecessary. I get you want to keep it low key, and you didn't like her making a fuss. But her intentions were not bad. I think you should have asked your child if they wanted a party before unilaterally turning it down. People don't always handle adoption in the most tactful way but you have to look at someone's intention or you are going to be spending years getting angry at people. \n\n\n Maybe they want to celebrate with their friends. I'm a former adoption worker with children from foster care and it's extremely common for people to celebrate afterwards and to mark the occasion every year with a celebration. As a teacher she's probably been to adoptions like this before. It wasn't uncommon for teachers, friends, and a bunch of other people in the child's life showing up for the hearing. Her asking was not inappropriate from my experience. Teacher's are encouraged to do stuff like that. She sounds like a good teacher. If you didn't want anyone but family you needed to come up with a more tactful reply. Saying you are just trying to keep it to immediate family but you appreciate her offering to be there.", "NTA\n\nThis is not appropriate for a school setting, IMO.\n\nWhat about other children who may be fostered who are in the classroom?  \n\nIt just rubs me wrong that the class would celebrate this.  It is a family thing.", "NTA\n\nHer insistence sounds like she's trying to virtue signal, honestly. She's put it in her head that Xander needs support when there's no reason to even think that, like wtf?", "NTA. As a teacher I would have said \u201ccongratulations, that\u2019s great news\u201d and that\u2019s about it.", "NTA she should\u2019ve read the room on your first response. Her hurt feelings are her own deal.", "Apparently, AITA is coming for the teachers today.\n\nTelling her not to acknowledge it is fine: It's a well-intentioned gesture on her part, but not what you want.\n\nTelling her she's not important is seriously misguided: he's 7. You do your son a massive disservice by insulting his teacher. He spends all day with her 5 days a week. Teachers are massively important in kids' lives. She's still getting to know him, and you, because it's the beginning of the year. Give her a break. YTA.", "NTA. Its a private family event. Also, I agree that your kid should be made to feel that he\u2019s always been your kid and this is just a little technicality in your life - no need to make a big deal about it.", "ESH She needs to respect the boundaries you set, but there's no reason to accuse her of an ulterior motive. \n\nShe's a second grade teacher, she is probably just a halpy person and wants to use opportunities to have her students practice inclusiveness and diversity. Maybe she has some personal experience with the foster system and knows how important a strong support system is. \n\nYou can give a firm no without judgements and accusations.", "I am caught her not sure if your an AH or not.\n\nTo be fair the teacher was trying to do something nice for you and Xander.", "YTA. You assign her such nefarious intentions.. NTA for saying no, but your defenitely the AH for how you spoke to her and how you speak about her here. She wasn't making it about her, she just thought it was a happy occasion and wanted to celebrate it for him.\n\nInstead of being happy your teacher care above and beyond for their students, you treat her so horribly.\n\nAlso I think you make a lot of decision for your son and make a lot of assumptions about him. You should have told her you would ask him and give her his answer. You say he's nonchalant - but for a kid to go to court can feel very exciting and special, even if he doesn't show it. Also people can be nonchalant about important mile stones, and still want to celebrate it, because it's fun.\n\n'and our court date isn't going to change our daily life.' - and birthday is going to change his life? Still teachers celebrate their student's birthdays. All celebrations teacher do for kids are about tiny things that happen to tiny kids. That's what they do. It's not about the thing, it's about the kid.\n\nMaybe the teacher thought you don't want to celebrate with the kids, because you don't necessarily need to publish it to everyone, so she suggested a smaller celebration just with a gift from the teacher, since she's already in the loop. And then you came out at her.\n\nSo for me YTA,", "You both seem pretty insufferable tbh - ESH", "NTA\n\n This isn't about her at all.", "NTA, but you could have phrased it better. It\u2019s not that your teacher isn\u2019t important to your child (she likely is), it\u2019s that you don\u2019t want to make the adoption into a big deal for your child.", "NTA: she sounds like the sort of person who would brag that some of her best friends are black.", "NTA (but kinda are at the same time). I myself am highly family-centric and if you are not part of my family then you can F-off but there is simply no such thing as too much positive support of a child, especially one in a situation like foster care. It would be/have been better to let the child decide if HE wanted the party or for his teacher to be that involved.", "Wow, your cold", "NTA - It\u2019s a family matter and he is your child -. She wants to be involved, but it is over stepping a boundary for you. I do think it was nice of the teacher. You kindly declined, she will get over it.", "NTA. Your son needs to process this with just the few of you who really matter. We had an adoption ceremony in our family recently. The adoptive father and his parents had loved my 5 yo g'son from his infancy, and we all considered each other family, but the proceedings were especially important to them\u2014this would be their only grandchild and they were thrilled that it would be legal.  At the judges behest, the new g'parents spoke briefly \u2014husband and I were asked to speak also but we are keeners who will weep like banshees at the drop of a hat, so I waived that off\u2014nonetheless, all the adults, including the lawyer and judge, cried. G'son himself just walked around the courtroom with a box of tissues he picked up from the judge's desk saying, \"why is everyone's eyes red?\" That little ceremony was enough\u2014he did not need a big deal being made by anyone outside of our little family.", "NTA - I don\u2019t fault her for asking, but it is a private family event and she should have left it at that.", "NTA, she was trying to butt in on a family thing.", " NTA - in fact I would go to the principal and suggest adoption education training for the teachers. She\u2019s practicing saviorism. And that sucks.", "ESH, you could\u2019ve said no without telling her that she isn\u2019t important.", "YTA for how you said it and your general attitude towards his teacher. You could have more politely declined as she clearly is passionate about teaching and well-meaning. Your response was unnecessarily cruel.", "YTA.", "People worried about being humble because they are worried about being judged is going to be a problem in the future. IMO, the worst is when you're a middle-aged to boomer aged person talking about people celebrating their achievements as if those people didn't deserve to celebrate them because they were being too loud and proud about it. \n\nIf the adoption is transactional to you, it's okay to not celebrate and make it a big deal, but I say YTA because of how you turned down the teacher. She may just be a very kind person wanting to celebrate a big day for one of her beloved kids. I hope you don't raise Xander to be mean like that.  You could have said that you didn't want to make it a big deal so that Xander didn't think he was any different from his classmates, but in actuality you made it about you not wanting clout or whatever. That word of the year is so overused, like snowflake, humble brag, etc....", "NAH. Teacher is a bit extra, but as long as she respects your answer (and she did ask before throwing him a party at school), she didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong. Just a bit socially awkward.  \nCongrats on making what already is legally official", "It's a rare occurrence when no one is TA.", "Is it a requirement to give the reason for absence? I don\u2019t tell my daughters school, I put \u201cday off\u201d as the reason - none of their business!", "NTA - Though, may be worth asking your son how he feels!", "NTA - she overstepped, but you definitely could've phrased your refusal nicer. She wasn't trying to be mean or anything, and I think you could've just explained that this was a family-only event, and that Xander really didn't want to make a big thing of it.", "All of this could have been avoided if you would have simply stated that your child would not be in class...full stop. He is your child, you don't need to give a reason. NTA", "As a parent who adopted three kids, I hear you! Being treated as if adoption is heroic is gross and oblivious. Good for you for shutting that down. NTA", "NTA - I understand the teacher's fascination because fostering and adoption are relatively uncommon. The request to do a class celebration was reasonable; it's also nice to see that she asked for permission rather than just doing it. If everything stopped there, I would have had a totally different opinion.\n\nAsking to come to court was weird. I understand the interest since so few people in the population would see that kind of event, but asking if she could come to the proceeding feels like asking if she could be in the delivery room for a baby being born; everyone would agree that is creepy as hell. \n\nWhile your response may have been harsh, what your family wants is reasonable which is to treat the adoption as a legal formalization of something already true, Xander is part of your family.", "Is there a \"no one is the anus here\" option?\n\nThe teacher just didn't expect you to say that. No one is in the wrong here.", "NTA.\nAs as an educator and an ex LAC, this teacher has stepped into strange territory and is overstepping. It's entirely normal to feel excited about a child being adopted, it's perhaps normal -if you had an extensively close relationship with the child AND parent- to get a card and a commemorative gift, but I absolutely agree with you, she's doing everything possible to make it about her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But, he said no and she didn't listen. **That** makes **her** the asshole.\n\nOP is curt, but that doesn't mean anything when she won't take \"No\" for an answer. He's not one of her 7yo students. He's allowed to say No to her.", "Heck I\u2019m 31 and I can remember all my teachers names from before 6th grade and how I felt in their class.", "Invite herself to the court hearing and bring a small present of some kind.", "She asked about a party, he said no. She asked about a completely different way of celebrating by going to the courthouse, he was a dick in the way he said no. It\u2019s not like she asked him multiple times and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer; she asked two separate questions.", "Smart kids, sounds like they found a cupcake loophole lol\n\nPrior to COVID for a bit we did stuff like this at work (healthcare) make up off the wall stuff and bring in cupcakes. The higher ups didn't want us to keep food in our area but were ok with celebrations.", "Her offering the party beforehand, I can see that as being an ok gesture. She was told no and that the 7 year old wouldn't like that sort of thing. She then kept going with insisting and suggesting ways for her to be apart of it, that's where she's the A H. Plus nowadays idk if I would trust someone to do something like that and not try to post about and talk about it everywhere, let kids have privacy, especially something as big as adoption.", "Yes 100%. I feel like people are missing this part. That\u2019s next level crazy to me.", "Absolutely! Especially true of 7 year olds who may have some trauma in their past. (not specific to this story since we don\u2019t have any background, but often true with many kids who are \u201cin the system\u201d)", "Yes sure, but the Info question remains unanswered. Did he/she ask their son what he would like?", "I agree, but all OP had to say was: I appreciate the thought, but I think kiddo would feel singled out.", "I disagree, teachers have a huge impact on children. Kids spend more time in class that with their parents. The teacher could have no meaning for OP but that doesn't means it's the same for his son", "This attitude is so shitty and toxic! Even just calling a teacher unimportant is fucked, especially after multiple comments indicating that he wants his kid in class and not missing school. Her intentions are misguided, but this dude is presumptuous af.", "I didn\u2019t say it was. If the family wants to invite the whole class to the adoption proceedings and everyone is happy about that, then great. The problem is assuming that that is the default and inserting yourself into the family\u2019s plans without invitation.", "But it can turn into that, and the teacher showed that she buys into that crap by telling OP what a wonderful person he is for adopting.", "Exactly. Most kids just want to be \u201cnormal\u201d. They don\u2019t want to be othered.", "Mine are 15 and 12 at the moment. So I am very familiar with that situation haha", "My guy, you are speaking my thoughts this morning. This sub honestly makes me laugh hysterically but also sad\u2026to think that so many people not only agree with OP or any other person in the wrong, but they feel the need to share how much of an asshole they are as though they\u2019re proud of it. \n\nOP of this post was evidently jerking himself off while writing this out trying to paint the teacher in a bad light here.", ".", "OP is welcome to have whatever \"celebration\" he wants, but his reasoning for it is bananas. He does not have the child's best interest in mind, period. There is a reason why there are *thousands* of kids who were adopted by their foster parents but end up back in the system. My state alone has at least 1k. OP should be opening his arms up to anyone who wants to show support to his kid, especially now, but he is ignorant to appropriate relationships and boundaries. His attitude will only hurt the kid. \n\nHe doesnt need to have a public party, but he especially doesnt need to be a dick about it. Sabotaging his relationship with his child's teacher is irresponsible parenting.", "Teacher \"Oh great, should I do an event with the class?\"\n\nOP \"No thanks. We don't want to make a big thing out of it.\"\n\nTeacher \"Ok. If Xander would like, I could come to the adoption ceremony.\"\n\nOP \"We're going to keep it small and low key.\"\n\nTeacher \"Ok.  I'm so excited for Xander. I hope you two have a great day.\"\n\nIs that so hard?  How was this anything but polite?  How is she making it about \"her\" and not Xander?", "It quite literally IS the end of the story.\n\nWhat on earth is going on here?", "His teacher of 3 weeks is that invested in his adoption that she is trying to change the way the family wants to celebrate it. That\u2019s not cynical, it\u2019s just not being an idiot. \n\nIf there was a longer term relationship there AND if the family/child wanted him that\u2019s fine! But pushing your way into an incredibly private moment with virtual strangers is absolutely an AH move. Downvote away!", "I literally shared why I'm early of such things as somewho spent a decade in foster care and was emancipated from it. Reality is not everyone is nice for nice sake. It's the feeling they get from it, without taking into account the person they are allegedly doing something for. Xander family didn't see it as nice, abd rejected it  as they should have. Maybe another kid and family would appreciate it and that would be OK in that situation.", "That\u2019s the situation and that context matters. \n\nThe issue is that OP assumed negative intent and got extremely aggressive and insulting with his wording after his child\u2019s teacher offered 2 options of support **and did not get pushy or insistent* which is why this dialogue matters. \n\nHis decision was fine- it\u2019s the right one for his family. \n\nHis actions were not appropriate. \n\nHe acted like her **offer** was not appropriate. No- it\u2019s just not helpful or wanted. There are better ways to communicate that.", "Yeah, she has probably seen the videos where the teacher and whole class come to the proceedings to celebrate and wanted to have a feel good moment/video doing as such. It's perfectly within OP's rights to keep it private, although it sounds like he could have been nicer about it.", "I\u2019m hoping he meant to say \u201cbelongs with me\u201d and didn\u2019t realize how ick it sounded with a different preposition? \ud83d\ude2c", "Yea that part gave me the ick too.", "Agreed. That gives off creepy vibes.", "personally, that just sounds like you overthinking that single line and making it something it wasn't", "Super bothered by this also. Makes me actually question OP's motives for fostering.", "Same. I hated attention as a child", "Same, I would have been embarrassed and super uncomfortable.\n\nNot everyone reacts the same way to focused attention like that. Especially for something that makes you feel different and singled out with a possible side of trauma mixed in ( we have no idea how he came to be in foster care) and the uncomfortable comments and questions that might come up from other 7 year olds.", "School just started. Let's assume the kid's actual parents knows him and his wants better that someone who met him a week ago.", "Sure they can and do have a big impact, but they don't have any place going to the adoption ceremony. That's a family affair, and she's overstepping what should be the boundaries of her relationship with the student by wanting to go.", "There's one AH in this story, and it's OP for talking to the teacher the way he did.", "...she....she asked????? How is that inserting if you ask?????", "Thank you. That was exactly my point.", "Totally agree, just because you don't have to let the teacher celebrate and support it doesnt mean you're not an asshole for telling her shes not important and to go away", "It\u2019s wild to me because it tells me how many people are (or close to) being terminally online. The teacher is asking to celebrate a big moment, and show her support. Asking, not doing. Politely decline and say \u201cwe are a pretty private family, and we already have a close-knit celebration planned. We don\u2019t want to make him feel like he\u2019s different. We appreciate the kind gesture, but no thank you.\u201d", "\n\u201cI give the benefit of the doubt that she means well but to be blunt, she's not important to our family. Therefore this whole thing is none of her business. I don't know anything about her and she knows very little about us. Plus my son is NOT the kind of kid who would get excited at seeing his teacher outside of school hahaha. I could tell she was hurt.\n\nI get it. My son is the cutest kid in her class and all of his teachers liked him. It would make Mrs M feel good to do these things when I'm trying to keep things as normal as possible.\u201d\n\nThis whole section, screams narcissist. \u201cOh, my kid is the cutest, everyone likes him. so of course you want to do this but no, you\u2019re not important to our family.\u201d \n\nA simple no thanks would\u2019ve sufficed. But since he\u2019s a narcissist, that wouldn\u2019t do \ud83d\ude02", "The kid wasnt asked at all about this though, and if you read OPs responses he literally refers to the child as being his property, he owns them. I dont know how people can read what a smug asshole OP is acting like and instead choose to jump all over the teacher asking (not actually doing it) to do something they perceived as nice for the kid.", "I\u2019m replying specifically to someone who is talking about teachers showing support, and pointing out OP\u2019s kid specifically doesn\u2019t want to share moments with teachers outside of school. I absolutely agree with what you\u2019re saying but it is not at all what I\u2019m discussing or referring to right now. I\u2019m literally only speaking on the subject of involvement outside the classroom and what that might not look like for Xander and Xander only.", "Absolutely. I do wonder if he asked the kid what they wanted though", "I\u2019m hoping he meant to say \u201cbelongs *with* me\u201d and didn\u2019t realize how ick it sounded with a different preposition? \ud83d\ude2c", "I got a whole \u201cMatilda\u201d vibe. Teacher is Miss Honey.", "Are you adopted?  Because, as an adoptee, knowing you belong where you are, family wise, is literally the best thing ever.\n\nDunno if having a party or something at school is suitable, but, my parents used to celebrate my sister and I's adoption anniversary.", "Perhaps OP is just a bad writer. Yes you\u2019re correct... it\u2019s just my personal opinion. I just don\u2019t like the way he phrased that sentence. Could mean nothing. I just can\u2019t imagine saying or thinking that about a child (I have 4). It\u2019s a strangely possessive statement. In my opinion.\n\nHe knows he\u2019s my son makes sense to me ... He knows we are a family makes sense ... even he knows he belongs with me would be okay. He belongs to me .... ugh. I just don\u2019t like it.", "Oh my god grow the fuck up. Not everybody can be eloquent on the internet.", "Same and I still do. Birthday parties with a lot of kids singing Happy Birthday to me? Oh god just end me already, it\u2019s misery", "I remember at my son's 2nd birthday he cried when everyone sang \ud83d\ude05", "Do we know if his classmates even know he was being fostered?  Kids can be cruel and he may want to avoid all the remarks about why his \"real\"* parents didn't keep him.\n\n*\"real\" in quotes because the people who love you and raise you are your real parents.", "Absolutely! I will also assume the teacher meant no malice & was just trying to offer her help", "Ah yes, OP is horribly abusive to his child because he worded one phrase strangely\u2026", "i don\u2019t want to minimize your experience but \u201cbelonging\u201d * in * a group is not at all the same as belonging * to * an individual", "But he didn't say anything about the family belonging. It was literally \"he belongs to me\".", "I don\u2019t know .... \u201che belongs to me\u201d is not really a term of endearment.\n\nOnly time I ever said that is when my kids got in trouble & I had to claim them ... \u201cthat one belongs to me\u201d", "people on sub get hung up on the dumbest crap.", "wut", "Especially not serial killers", "OP projects that his kid is the cutest. We have no reason to believe the \u201cnefarious teacher latched onto the cute kid and then pushed her way into a celebration where she wasn\u2019t wanted.\u201d\nA teacher heard one of her students was having a positive life event and offered to support and celebrate that. She was rebuffed by someone with a totally asshole tone and didn\u2019t push after that. OP is a massive AH.", "I do see the harm.  She wasn\u2019t invited, she invited herself.  OP is NTA.", "And the whole asking to be there? WTF?  Really inappropriate.", "It\u2019s my personal opinion .... I think it\u2019s strangely possessive. I don\u2019t like it.", "Except when it is.\n\nAgain, if you aren't adopted, you don't get it, how you read it doesn't remotely matter.  What you are doing is putting your own mistaken assumptions and personal bias onto a situation you have zero experience of.\n\nNo different than saying \"My heart belongs to you\".  Most people aren't going to think that means the other person owns your heart, that you've made it property.\n\nSame here.  Nuance is important, kids.", "Maybe he is a single parent adopting?", "So?\n\nYou don't have any sort of special talent to pick out teh hidden meaning in OPs comments, bud, just for creating mountains out of molehills.\n\nThe only reason you think he sees the kid as an object to own is your own bias and thirst for upvotes.", "It makes me think OP had the goal of adopting, not fostering. \u2639", "I don\u2019t know. OP\u2019s attitude just seems off to me. It\u2019s just too aggressive & it doesn\u2019t match what is happening. It\u2019s very strange.
