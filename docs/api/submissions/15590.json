It isn't fair for you to be the only person cooking like an adult.  He can learn to cook some basic healthy recipes.", "NTA - sounds like weaponized incompetence.", "NTA! This is yet another case of weaponized incompetence. No, you shouldn't have to order takeout to make up for his immature refusal to learn how to cook properly. There are PLENTY of meals that are simple to make, he has no excuse. Take out gets expensive. He's an adult, it's time he learn how to act like one.", "NTA - Your not wrong for pointing out the flaw he has in regards to cooking in general, I do find it odd he go defensive about it. Is there a reason for that? That being said this man is 28 years old he should be able to make the basics....Eggs (done), Potoatos (not just fries), a simply chicken mean, beef meal, pork meal and at least 2 simple desserts, this does not include some staples like soups.   \n\n\nI'm also wondering if he is using malicious incompetence to a point as he is getting a better deal having only to make those 3 things.", "NTA this guy is 29 and does not know how to cook more things. Is he just playing dumb or what. You could always cook your own food and offer him to do all the dishes. Can't really force him to cook more unless he wants to", "NTA. He doesn't want to cook so he's being incompetent on purpose. Make him pay for the takeout.", "NTA\nOrdering take out gets expensive really fast, at least in the U.S.\n\nCan you add a day where you both work together to learn a new item from a cookbook?  \n\nAlso, he does fries, scrambled eggs and pancakes because they are three of the easiest things to cook quickly.  He's just being lazy and hoping you'll take over instead.  This part of the relationship is where you learn what the other person is like and whether you want to put up with it the rest of his life.", "NTA. And honestly, none of those are MEALS exactly. This feels like weaponized incompetence. Now, if he truly doesn't want to learn to cook more things but is willing to PAY for you to order out on his nights to provide dinner (provided you don't share finances), that's fine. But if he won't learn to make anything else and expect you to buy your own take out if you don't like it, then he's basically just trying to get you to give up and stop making him do his fair share. Don't let it work.", "NTA. He is too grown to only know/be willing to make 3 different things. He needs to stop being lazy and learn more recipes. There are plenty of easy meals out there. Next time you cook you should only make enough for yourself because he doesn\u2019t deserve the effort you put in.", "There\u2019s plenty of cookbooks aimed at, how to put this charitably, young men who have limited cooking skills and need help with the basics & making straightforward meals that are actually meals.\n\nOption 1) There\u2019s some meals that skip a lot of the decision-making - think Hamburger Helper - where the BF doesn\u2019t have to think that much and provides a baseline to work with/innovate from.\n\nOption 2) Cookbooks where he\u2019s the target audience. \u201cA Man, A Can, A Plan\u201d comes to mind; there\u2019s probably a bunch of \u201cfive ingredients or less\u201d options too.\n\nAlso, he probably needs help understanding how/why spices - and for this, salt and pepper DO count - should be added to food.", "Weaponized incompetence.\n\nNTA", "NTA. That would be frustrating! He definitely needs to learn at least how to cook one other thing. A cooking class might be fun!", "NTA If I were 29 and that's all I could cook I'd be extremely embarrassed. Fries also aren't really a meal, more a side to go with a meal.", "NTA. I've met adults who can't even cook rice, so I'm supporting anyone who can make three complete meals. :-) But, no. *I* would not want to suffer eating the same three meals every other night for the rest of this year. Nope. So, I'd buy him some cookbooks and tell him to invest a little time in good websites that clearly demonstrate meal preparations. \n\nI was teaching my youngest brother to prepare meals when he was like 8 and an eating machine. I just wanted him to be able to help himself and not wait around for the big people to do things. So, I always think cooking is a simple chore - you just have to take the time to learn how.", "NTA.\nHe may not be weaponising incompetence, but he's certainly nursing it.\n\nIs there a reason why he's unwilling to cook anything else? Maybe he just needs to be taken out of his comfort zone.", "NTA, he\u2019s trying to avoid contributing. Don\u2019t let that slide surely", "NTA. it probably gets frustrating eating the same thing over and over lol.", "He already knows how to cook fries. What more do you want? Just Kidding.  He should definitely learn more.", "This is what is called weaponized incompetence. If he\u2019s shit at what you want him to do, you won\u2019t ask him to do it anymore and he can go back to being lazy. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s absolutely not too much to ask. He needs to learn how to cook more than 3 things, and there are tons of recipes out there that are just as easy to make as those 3 things that you mentioned. Maybe help him look up easy recipes and offer help him learn how to cook them. If he\u2019s resistant to that, you might have a much bigger problem on your hands.", "NTA\n\nSuggested steps/Info gathering:\n\n1. Ask him if he knows how to cook. Get a book like Cooking for Dummies and work together with him to make a few meals together so he feels more comfortable and can branch out on his own.\n2. Ask him if he would prefer that meal prep become a \"we do this together\" task.\n3. Ask him if he would prefer something like \"meal prep saturday/sunday\" in which case you both will cook giant batches of 3-4 meals and you portion/freeze them to make your own TV dinners for the rest of the week.\n4. Ask him if he likes to cook.  Maybe he can't f'ing stand it, or just doesn't want to.  In which case you need to have a very different conversation and I suggest that you ask one of the advice subreddits about how to proceed with his passive agressiveness instead of having a conversation with you about it so you can both find a fair solution.", "NTA. sounds like he's a bit self conscious about the fact that he doesn't know how to cook, would not be surprised if he was never taught how to because \"the men don't cook\" in his family and he learned those 3 recipes in college to live off of. Not really sure what the best solution is if he just refuses to learn how to cook anything else though. could be any number of issues from him just being embarrassed all the way to him just being straight up misogynistic and refusing to learn to cook because \"it's your job\". would recommend figuring out what the problem is though because that'll definitely impact your relationship in the future", "NTA. He needs to learn to cook more people really don't think about the what if's in life. Like if you and him split you cannot financially sustain eating out for 3 meals a day 7 days a week (at least most of us cant). The man is almost 30. It is time to learn to cook something else. Nothing hard even. But like seriously there are 100s of 1 pot/pan meals that are so easy...", "NTA I guess I\u2019m petty because I\u2019d cook the same 3 meals then (but healthy choices). See how he\u2019d react!", "NTA.\n\nIf he's responsible for food that day, then if food is takeout, it's his bill to pay, otherwise he didn't take responsibility for dinner... This really isn't about cooking skill though. As you two dabble in caring for each other, he has expressed no empathy. He doesn't appear to care for your nutrition, enjoyment or wallet... he's just doing what he personally wants for himself. This seems telling for his attitude about the relationship in general and really seems like something you'll need to sort out.\n\nI would add the caveat that if you just said \"could you cook more than 3 meals?!\" while you were frustrated which is what it sounds like you said that that could definitely make a person defensive. And when your approach makes somebody defensive, it can definitely lead them to sticking to some stupid stances. He may be more willing than you think if you take an approach that's less about highlighting his incompetence. Maybe once a week pick a new recipe and learn to cook it together. That way he can learn more cooking skills but it's more of a \"let's have an adventure\" vibe than a \"you suck, get better\" vibe. Or if he's really lost in the kitchen then maybe you're the cook everyday but he does all the dishes every night.", "NTA. Honestly, this would be a deal breaker for me. He\u2019s almost 30 and he doesn\u2019t even know how to cook a full meal? That\u2019s unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nAre those even cooking meals?\n\nLike I feel scramble eggs is breakfast, not dinner.\nSame for pancakes, breakfast or a snack unless he is making savory pancakes with filling and cheese ect....\nAnd fries are a side more than a full meal.\n\nIs your BF not making these same 3 items in an attempt to get out if having to actually cook in the hope you will just do it?\n\nMaybe try for a few weeks taking him up on his offer om when it his turn to cook buy yourself tasty food, not sure of there is anyone near you that sells home cooked meals from their home?\nHe will quickly tire of those 3 same food items when you are having decent supper instead.", "What did he do for food before you? He survived off eggs and pancakes?", "He can do fries, as in.. legitmately not just microwaved but actually properly cooked fries even if from a bag just thrown in?\n\nAnd yet gets defensive at the idea of say... throwing some pasta in some water and litterally throwing a sauce over it?\n\nNo.. NTA im amazed at that age he also doesnt agree that its boring and repetitive... good grief i hit the point at 22 where id had enough of all those carbs and my brain forced me to learn how to make a salad, surely he can cook some protein up chop up some salad items!?\n\ncooking .. not that hard.. (perfecting it.. sure!) i agree with some of the comments, pick something simple to do yourself and see if he'll chat with you while doing it... make him see how simple some of these things can be.\n\non a side note seeing people suggesting he looks at videos and guides... we recently started hello fresh for convenience... most of their meals are about 8 components (a carb, a meat, 1-2 veg and some sauce or stock) and you dont need to buy anything to access their recipies..\n\n  \n[https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes](https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou can change the tld (.com) to pretty much any country they operate to get different ideas, and if you ARE using the one for your country chances are, all of the ingredients are available locally, and where they arent theyre probably sauces you could make from scratch fairly easily.", "NTA, maybe teach him how to cook some of the things you\u2019d enjoy. Cook things together :) it\u2019s good way to make up as well", "I am a very versatile eater and comfortable in the kitchen, so therefore I cook a lot more than my partner does, who is a touch more picky and doesn't have a large repertoire of meals he can prepare. I recently let him know (kindly) that I'd love for him to help out in the kitchen and maybe learn how to cook some of the meals I frequently make for us, and ever since we've had a really fun time in the kitchen cooking together. I would approach it from a similar POV; it's possible he's defensive because he's insecure that he isn't more versed in cooking. Sounds like he's got breakfast foods down-- maybe he can be in charge of breakfast! And if that doesn't seem like a fair consolation, I would suggest making it more of a collaborative effort. You're NTA, but I would just be sensitive to where he is coming from. If he flat out refuses to make an effort and it's affecting your relationship, that's when it gets tricky and he begins to cross over into AH territory.", "If he can read and has the use of at least one hand, he can cook. Anyone can. Insist he try. Sure you could \"make it fun\", \"learn together\", \"take cookery classes\", but fuck that noise: he's 29 and he should be *ashamed* of himself for lacking a basic adult skill. Like I say : insist. \n\nNTA", "NTA but maybe the two of you can cook together three nights a week, then split the other nights evenly? That way you can try new recipes together and you can teach him the skills he's missing. People convince themselves that cooking is complicated and develop a fear-of-failure reaction. Cooking together and teaching him new skills will help him gain confidence and hopefully realize that he is much more capable than he thinks.", "NTA and get a new boyfriend. It is just ridiculous to me that at 29 he doesn't have any clue at all about how to cook other foods?!? Spaghetti comes to mind as super easy. All these comments about how you need to help him learn is garbage, you are not his parent and there are tons of accessible resources to learn. I maybe could understand helping him if he asked/was open to it or if he was much younger. I say tell him to either develop some cooking skills (maybe cooking together but him taking point) or you will be only cooking for one. I'm curious what other skills he lacks (laundry perhaps)??", "NTA\n\nAs my grandmother said, \"If you can read, you can cook. \"     It's even easier when there are videos! He has to win your stomach over if that's the way to a man's heart! \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25", "NTA\n\nWhen you cook something, why not get him to help you cook and make it a thing you do together? Can be fun cooking with your partner, plus then he\u2019ll learn how to cook other things and you can both eat a variety of foods!", "NTA. I'm like your boyfriend. I'm a picky eater with few cooking skills and would be happy to eat the same handful of simple meals I can make 24/7. I would not, however expect the same of others and would make damn sure I learned some other dishes if I became responsible for cooking for others regularly.\n\nThis is a shared responsibility he agreed to. It's one thing to mutually agree to toss it and do your own thing sometimes if you can't agree on what to have, but there needs to be a balance. He needs to pull his weight and come up with a better compromise than \"buy yourself takeout whenever it's my turn to cook\", or you guys needs to revisit how you split chores to make up the difference in effort.", "NTA. I also have had this conversation with my partner and at first they were a little defensive. I think it helps to frame it as a skill (as it is) and not a character flaw. I think it helps to get them involved with what you're doing. Have them start out with simple things like chopping onions, how to measure flour, etc. Keep it positive and encouraging and explain what you are doing and why and what you've learned does and doesn't work. Have them taste things as you go and explain what you are thinking something needs and why. Choose something you know they enjoy eating and have them pick out a recipe that looks good and make it together. It will take a while, but they might start getting into a groove and look forward to the creative process. I've found doing all of this has really helped  my partner find their wings and get excited about making different things.", "NTA - (depending on how you said it).  \n\nDude can learn to cook- it aint hard. Follow recipes and voila food. Sometimes it even tastes good!", "When I saw the title, I thought you might be unreasonable. I mean three meals is enough variety for a lot of people If you both knew three meals each then that gives you a different meal everyday and that's plenty for most people.\n\n\n\nHOWEVER, these three are not \"meals\". Your boyfriend doesn't know how to cook meals AT ALL.\n\n\nNTA.\n\n\nEither your boyfriend learns how to cook or he take some some of your chores to compensate for not helping with this job.", "NTA. \n\nI would get a cookbook or look at a YouTube channel for some things you can cook together once and then let him cook those things when it's his turn. Perhaps even take a cooking class together and make it a fun couple's activity.", "It seems like he felt hurt by your request, maybe he thinks you insinuated he's not pulling his weight or something. But I get why you would want him to learn to cook more healthy dishes. So technically NTA\n\nBut it does seem like you maybe should go about it a bit more compassionately? Maybe he is embarrassed about his cooking skills or has another reason to be insecure about the subject. Maybe offer to take a course together, to teach him in a relaxed setting (on the weekend maybe). When I was 20 I was able to make maybe 5 or 6 dishes, but with the help of my husband (in that case being there if I needed help or had questions and leaving me alone for the rest of the time, but everyone is different) I learned quickly and today am a very avid and ambitioned home cook who even makes her own pasta, pizza etc. from scratch. But when I started out I was basically scared I'd burn water XD\n\nMaybe try and find out what his problem is and try to solve it together. And yes, giving him the option to take a break once in a while and get takeout sounds fair to me as well. Just not every time, that's not healthy.", "NTA but if it was me I would just have us each cook for ourselves 100% of the time. If he wants to eat pancakes every night, he can. Ultimately, his cooking isn\u2019t going to be comparable to yours, probably if he\u2019s gotten this far with this little. I think if he HAS to cook for himself he\u2019s more likely to want to learn more, and if not \u2014 well, he can enjoy his eggs.", "NTA it's about time he learns how to function as an adult.", "This is weaponized incompetence. He's trying to get you to capitulate and start cooking all meals.", "NTA, but maybe he doesn't know how to cook, so he just goes for super easy things. Maybe try teaching him other recipes. Unless it's a laziness factor, then in which case you have every right to be irritated. But I wouldn't rule it out that he just doesn't know how to cook.", "NAH, you have a reasonable request and your BF has a pretty normal, if counterproductive, insecurity about criticism of his limited cooking skills. Not everyone comes to adulthood with the same priorities and skills. Take a step back, ensure he knows it's not about him as a person or his values or stubbornness or priorities, and try to see if you can find out where he's coming from. I bet you find some carrot sticks, bread and butter, and cheese start to appear before very long. \ud83d\ude09", "So the situation you are in is that your bf effectively can't cook, but you're sharing the cooking duties. He doesn't seem to care about eating the same thing all the time.\n\nThe obvious solution is for you, who can cook, to do all the cooking, and he does a bunch of other different chores. Some people just don't care about eating a variety of meals, and are happy to eat the same things all the time.", "NTA he literally can learn how to cook more things that are just as easy to cook.", "I don\u2019t quite think we have enough information here to make a judgement.  It all depends on how the conversation went.\n\nDid you come across as saying he needs to learn how to cook or undermining his current contribution?  Was it just complaining you are sick of eating pancakes?  Was in supportive in saying let\u2019s pick some new recipes for each of us to try?\n\nWas his reaction a flat out No?  Was he defensive because he was attacked\n\nIn general I think this is a NAH for now because he should learn how to cook more things however his reaction suggests he felt attacked with how you brought up the issue so more discussion is warranted.  I can read Maybe can you try to learn how to cook more things as both an attack or a friendly request.", "NTA \n\nButtttt mmy hubby was that way. 3 things. Asked for more, and that's a huge regret. Caught kitchen on fire twice. Once had to redo while kitchen. No, he wasn't trying to start a fire. Now 21 years later and for 15 years he is not allowed to cook in the kitchen at all. \n\nSo if you want him to cook differently, maybe ask for 2 nights where you cook together so we can learn but enjoy it as well.", "I think this is an NTA/ NAH. I think this is a communication issue. Have you asked your bf if he enjoys cooking? It's absolutely reasonable to expect a grown up person to cook and take care of themselves. But not every person needs to be great at everything. Maybe he struggles with cooking, is not enjoying it at all and is happy to have \"mastered\" at least those three dishes? Maybe he generally struggles with food, being super picky?\n\nIn that case you might wanna rethink your chore division or suggest to help him, teaching him a few more simple dishes he feels comfortable with. Eating take out however is indeed no alternative.", "NTA it takes 2 minutes to Google a recipe and all you have to do is follow it. \n\n This may be the time to draw a line in the sand though. If he's completely unwilling you'll need to decide if you want to live like this or if it's time to find someone whose at least willing to try.", "NAH- yet. \n\nIf he doesn't want to cook more than three meals, that's fine. If you don't want to eat those three meals all the time, that's also fine.\n\nIf you separate this chore so that each of you is cooking for yourself, would he *then* be upset that he's eating the same three meals?
