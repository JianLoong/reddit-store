I never suggested I condone her past racism or racist actions.\n2.  I do think in the situation about the discussion that OP is T A for how he spoke to his girlfriend about it, someone he's choosing to carry on a rship with.\n3.

It seems like she was following the expectation of her sorority at the time? I\u2019m not saying her actions were right, obviously the behaviour is reprehensible. But so is sorority hazing in general so idk. Sororities are exclusionist by definition. It makes me wonder why it has taken two years for it to be an issue?\n\nRacism is learned and Unlearning is hard. Unlearning is a process that requires love and support. Yes your girlfriend did the wrong thing in the past. Yes she needs to change. Ostracism isn\u2019t going to help her to come to new ways of being and thinking about others and their inherent worth and value. \n\nInducing that kind of shame is likely to both break her trust in you and the relationship whilst placing another barrier to growing as a human being and changing her views. \n\nI know this is an incredibly tough situation for you to be placed in. I can imagine it was heart wrenching to hear that someone you love has behaved this way. I\u2019m really sorry this has happened. \n\nIn future, if someone comes to you looking for support with something that makes you angry like this, it might be a better choice to let them know that you don\u2019t have capacity to support them with the issue and to help them find someone who does\u2026", "YTA\n\nShe has made bad decisions in the past, and now it comes back on her.\n\nYou should be supportive now.

I assumed it was college kids being overly sensitive but that is full blown racism.", "Omg this is absolutely disgusting. This hurts my heart. Your (ex) GF should be expelled and charged with hate crimes.", "I hope you can find a way to do it that somehow makes it clear to her that even though you\u2019re ending the relationship, you hopes she can change and backing better, for her own sake. I worry that people with racism on their past get ostracized by everyone not racist, thereby pushing them towards racism in the end because raciest people are the only people that will accept them as friends.", "Good. And guarantee after only two years, she hasn't actually stopped being racist, she's just learned to keep those thoughts and actions under wraps. When you break up with her, please make sure to tell her exactly why. She needs to know how unacceptable her behavior was.", "Why bother posting this if you're breaking up with her? Was this just to get a moral clap on the back?", "Do you think she should kill herself?", "What is there to plan? Do you have assets that need splitting? Childcare to work out? Dump this train wreck now.", "Planning on breaking up with her? Like you didn't have an opportunity right then? I'm sorry. What were you waiting for... one more 'night'? Her actions were repulsive and the fact that she shows so little remorse as to feel victimized when they come back to haunt her is very telling but your stringing someone along when you know you're going to break up with her makes you TA as well.", "I know it\u2019s possible for people to change their ways. My friend\u2019s brother used to be a neo nazi and had an interaction that made him open his eyes and make a complete 180. No idea what that specific interaction was, though. I\u2019ve only met him twice and not in situations where it would be appropriate for me to delve into his past.\n\nA willingness for self reflection is definitely key, though. And it sounds like OP\u2019s gal isn\u2019t feeling very open and willing to learn if she\u2019s still blaming others for her own behaviour and demanding respect she hasn\u2019t earned.", "It depends on your relationship with the person, their capacity for growth and your own capacity for dealing with something like this. \n\nOne way is to gently call them aside (ideally when things are calm) and have conversations with them where you focus on their actions and the impact they have. Avoid saing anything about their character, especially if they are committed to learning better. \n\nA key thing to remember is that everyone is taught racism, being taught it daily. Many people also benefit from racism in ways that aren't obvious. So everyone has to commit to listening, learning and doing better. It's probably going to be ongoing, lifetime work for a long time. Reading good books by anti-racist figures and listening to what they say on social media (with your ego set aside) is one of the easiest ways to learn about various ongoing topics for yourself. \n\nETA: good prep means being knowledgeable enough to carry these conversations.\n\nLots of people will care and want to do better and to make reparations for harm they have already caused. Some will clutch their ego tight and pretend they don't see their actions in a greater context. They only see a short version of their own behaviour and intent and mayyybe the impact on the person, but only in that specific moment in time. It's not fun for most people to hear they did something racist for sure. For some people in this group it'll take some coaxing before they come to the light and they will eventually come to the light. Honestly though in this era, how they respond to being called racist really speaks to their character. \n\nHere, OP's ex behaved in ways that most would see as blatantly racist. She gave no indication that she ever challenged the attitudes leading to this, no indication that she sought the girls she hurt and tried to make things better. When she says she regretted her actions, did she do anything about it or just say it to herself and move on? \n\nIt sounds like she learned racism is bad when the sorority said they were kicking her out. (On that note I wonder if the sorority gave her the option of attending anti Black racism workshops irrespective of her status in the sorority. ) I don't think that Miss Katie here is ready to accept that hazing Black people harder and more dangerously than others and still refusing membership is not on the same level as her losing her existing membership and getting called names. She put people in danger! \n\nI sincerely hope that one day she's ready to acknowledge what she did and she begins to learn to do better. I hope by holding firm to his values and being ready to enforce that with a breakup OP plants a seed to do better. Maybe when things are calmer they can have a conversation about why she's still in the wrong, and hopefully she'd be receptive. Up to now she hasn't shown that she's ready to come to terms with the impact of her actions.", "Reminds me of when Dick Cheney shot his \"friend\" in the face on a hunting trip and the guy who got shot had to apologize to *him*", "Where they were two years ago? Merrily doing shit like this. KKKatie didn't do it in a vacuum.", "She got in trouble for her actions. Odds are that only taught her to conceal her beliefs better.", "Nope, she's only feeling sorry for being kicked out, she didn't change! Had she changed she'd have apologised to those girls and pushed for a more diverse sorority herself! Now that the tables have turned she's all in her fee fees! Make her an ex", "I do think that college/University is when people really change the most. Teenagers kind of begin to question the values they've been taught before then, but until they're far from home, living with new people and being exposed new ideas there's only so much they can change. And change takes time.\n\nHer actions were terrible, I won't argue that for a second, but every one of us deserves the opportunity to change and to be judged by our new values - not by being blind to our past actions, but by looking at them and at how we feel about them now. She still has a way to go, but change should be encouraged.\n\nOP, if you break up with you I don't blame her. You were right in what you said. Maybe point out to her how important it is that she remembers how she feels now, and that she uses it as motivation to do better in future: nobody who has been abused owes their abuser forgiveness or respect, so if she doesn't want to feel like this again then she needs to treat others better.", "Would it matter?", "Does she regret her actions, or is it the consequences of her actions? Sounds like the latter to me. And I can only imagine how shitty she must have been to get a nickname like Klanswoman Katie. Get away from her OP, this relationship will affect your own reputation too.", "My friend was also engaged in promotional activity for right wing groups, his gf was a candidate in one of the right wing political parties, tbh I feel it's more of a character trait rather than indicator of how strong you feel about this stuff.", "Thank you very much for your response!", "In another post he says that the gf actually put bleach on a black girl's arm while calling her slurs (as one example of the hazing).\n\nThat goes way beyond \"you can be sued\"\n\nAnd straight into \"you can get a criminal conviction and go to prison\"", "They mean \"um no\".", "Awesome. Update us if you feel like it.", "Don\u2019t forget to post an update!", "if you can i'd recommend having a witness or a recording of breaking up with her. wouldn't trust someone like that to not try to spin it on you.", "Man I wanna see the update on her reaction lol", "Hard atheist chiming in: Jay-zuss Kee-rist!!!", "And she won\u2019t even name her actions as racist.", "My partner came from a deeply racist family and was able to break away from that in his teens. Still (now in our 30s) dismantling racial biases that we grew up with. One of the signs someone is making progress is that they own their shit - doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s girlfriend is there.", "Right, but in both of these cases they are surrounded be friends and family believing this shit. Then the second they have their bubble popped and see the world outside it, they rapidly change their mind. In this case though, OPs gf (well ex gf it sounds like), already had her bubble popped and decided \"nah, I will keep up this shit\" and perpetuated racism when in a leadership position in her sorority. That type of person dont change in two years, somebody who is in a bubble and gets a reality check absolutely might.", "hazing is disgustingly still alive and well, just very much kept under wraps. too many sisters and brothers have the \"i went through it, so you have to too\" or \"it's traditionnnnn\" mindset.", "My guess is she was a sophomore when it happened so most of the older girls that were the leaders at the time graduated already. It could be something the newer members either had to endure or just recently heard about but now that they have the majority they can do something about it and GF may be one of the only members still around from 2 years ago.", "What rubbish. Why wouldn\u2019t it also include white and other people of colour ganging up on her, as he himself is now?  As you quoted ! Do you You\u2019re writing absolute fiction now. \n\nI did say dump her. You really aren\u2019t that good at reading. Stop thinking about what you want to believe I said, with what I actually said & meant.", "I said much the same elsewhere in this thread. This girl is crying over people being mean to her, she should be worried about an arraignment", "Oh right, I thought this comment was towards another that was made, my bad.", " very mean and dehumanizing", "Agnostic coming in: Jesus Christ???", "That's how you get DEI \"advocates\" like the woman in this story: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11q4kf2/aita\\_because\\_someone\\_thought\\_i\\_was\\_lowincome\\_and/", "Exactly", "She's sorry she was punished, not that she was (probably still is) racist.", "omg yes", "You're right, but for people raised poorly that's often where change starts. If selfishness or self-centredness is the catalyst for positive change that's still better than no change, and it often leads to learning and growth.", "and that\u2019s not very grown up from her", "Yep. Very similar with me.\n\nMy family were not super racists (in fact by the standards of his generation, my grandfather was an outspoken anti-racist SJW and had voted left wing since at least the 1960s ... I remember him arguing passionately with others that interracial marriage was fine).\n\nBut I grew up in an area of Australia that had and still has a LOT of casual racism.\n\nAnd I own my racist attitudes now.\n\nIt sounds like the gf is not even close to owning any of it.\n\nI even edited the comment above because ***it turns out the gf literally put bleach on a black girl's arm while calling her slurs.*** Absolutely horrifying.\n\nShe's crying about being kicked out of the Sorority ... she should be thankful she's not in prison for committing a hate crime.", "Nothing more terrifying or deadly than a white woman's tears", "And that she outed herself unwittingly to her (soon to be ex) boyfriend. Who (cue shocked Pikachu face)  found her just as repulsive as everyone else.", "She won\u2019t even call her behaviour as racist, though \u2014 and that\u2019s an early step that she needs to admit.", "That's not an answer to the question I asked.\n\nAnd all that proves is that she knows racism is shitty and she knows better than to show her boyfriend that side of hers. It doesn't prove or even imply she isn't racist, or changed her mind on racism.", "Yah, OP said she forced them to apply skin bleaching creams. That's a really toxic chemical. I'm pretty sure it could constitute assault and battery, at which point its a federal offense and a hate crime. This girl is insane", "Yeah, saw that as well after I wrote this. That could definitively be criminal...", "I'm glad that this woman is getting what she deserves in terms of ostracism and condemnation.\n\nIn terms of the basis for charging her with a crime, I'll point out that skin bleaching creams are not particularly toxic in the sense of a single use. People use them regularly around the world as a beauty product, particularly those with uneven skin tones (though there are some who use it to benefit from colorism against darker skin tones). I think that the degradation that OP's soon-to-be ex inflicted upon the sorority pledges could constitute some sort of crime, depending on the jurisdiction, but it's unlikely to be tied to the toxicity of the cream."]}
