Many people also benefit from racism in ways that aren't obvious. So everyone has to commit to listening, learning and doing better, especially those who have benefitted from racism. It's probably going to be ongoing, lifetime work for a long time. Reading good books by anti-racist figures and listening to what they say on social media (with your ego set aside) is one of the easiest ways to learn about various ongoing topics for yourself. \n\nETA: good prep means being knowledgeable enough to carry these conversations.\n\nLots of people will care and want to do better and to make reparations for harm they have already caused. Some will clutch their ego tight and pretend they don't see their actions in a greater context. They only see a short version of their own behaviour and intent and mayyybe the impact on the person, but only in that specific moment in time. It's not fun for most people to hear they did something racist for sure. For some people in this group it'll take some coaxing before they come to the light and they will eventually come to the light. Honestly though in this era, how they respond to being called racist really speaks to their character. \n\nHere, OP's ex behaved in ways that most would see as blatantly racist. She gave no indication that she ever challenged the attitudes leading to this, no indication that she sought the girls she hurt and tried to make things better. When she says she regretted her actions, did she do anything about it or just say it to herself and move on? \n\nIt sounds like she learned racism is bad when the sorority said they were kicking her out. (On that note I wonder if the sorority gave her the option of attending anti Black racism workshops irrespective of her status in the sorority. ) I don't think that Miss Katie here is ready to accept that hazing Black people harder and more dangerously than others and still refusing membership is not on the same level as her losing her existing membership and getting called names. She put people in danger! * \n\nI sincerely hope that one day she's ready to acknowledge what she did and she begins to learn to do better. I hope by holding firm to his values and being ready to enforce that with a breakup OP plants a seed to do better. Maybe when things are calmer they can have a conversation about why she's still in the wrong, and hopefully she'd be receptive. Up to now she hasn't shown that she's ready to come to terms with the impact of her actions. \n\n**ETA 2: * I wrote my full comment before reading another comment where OP mentions one of the hazing activities. JFC, it's fucking bad. I hope Katie's circle can help her get her head right, but idk if there's much hope. If you don't want to click just know it's many layers of racist and fucked up. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11q06uz/comment/jc0srxc/", "Reminds me of when Dick Cheney shot his \"friend\" in the face on a hunting trip and the guy who got shot had to apologize to *him*", "Where they were two years ago?

She still has a way to go, but change should be encouraged.\n\nOP, if you break up with you I don't blame her. You were right in what you said.

I think communication is important. I said it's AH behavior for a partner to say it to a current romantic partner. It's unhealthy. You can't have a functional relationship when there's not mutual respect. If respect is gone, so is the relationship. You can't be a good partner to someone you don't respect. If he had broken up with her during the same conversation, he wouldn't be the AH. \n\n>Theorizing a loss of respect from reprehensible behavior \"indicates deep negative feelings\" may be true, but we really don't have access to enough info to say that, you'd need to actually know the OP, not read a single social media post.\n\nYou don't have to know someone to know a loss of respect indicates deep negative feelings. If there weren't deep negative feelings, then the loss of respect wouldn't occur. You might be disappointed. Or disheartened. But not lose respect altogether.", "It's so gratifying to find other Pratchett fans in the wild.", "no sorry but you're wrong. if you don't condemn racist you would have voted ESH, because as a racist she sucks no? voting y t a means that you think she's done no wrong because there is an option to recognise her wrong doings too, and you have pointedly ignored it to make a point.\n\nthe statement doesn't show what you said it does because there is a massive difference between saying something in the heat of a moment and making a decision later on. he had an initial reaction, like every human ever, and has then gone to calm down and think about it, like every mature human ever. he can absolutely think she doesn't deserve respect for it, because she doesn't, but at no point did he say she doesn't deserve respect as a person, just for her actions. massive difference there which you seem to be using interchangeably for your own interest to drive a point here.\n\nthe girlfriend is a racist, and he is being called toxic for needing more than 2 seconds to be able to both call out her racism and put his feelings in order and break up with her? would you be able to instantly make every right and logical decision upon being presented with an emotional dilemma? yeah that's not gonna happen, not for you, not for me, not for anyone. humans don't work that way. you're expecting perfection and digging into a slight fault which will be rectified later but, like I said in the first paragraph, choosing to ignore her racism. classy.\n\nyour entire argument fell apart when you doubled down on\n\n>verbalizes to them they don't deserve respect\n\nthis bit here, because he never said that she doesn't deserve respect, but that her actions don't.\n\nif you aren't defending the racist then vote ESH, and stop pretending any human can be perfect in the heat of an emotional situation. he'd be toxic if he insulted her and then stayed with her for that reason, he isn't toxic for condemning her racism and needing a short amount of time to collect himself before ending it.", "Demonolator here to add: Jesus Christ!"]}
