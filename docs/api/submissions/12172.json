I never suggested I condone her past racism or racist actions.\n2.  I do think in the situation about the discussion that OP is T A for how he spoke to his girlfriend about it, someone he's choosing to carry on a rship with.\n3.

It seems like she was following the expectation of her sorority at the time? I\u2019m not saying her actions were right, obviously the behaviour is reprehensible. But so is sorority hazing in general so idk. Sororities are exclusionist by definition. It makes me wonder why it has taken two years for it to be an issue?\n\nRacism is learned and Unlearning is hard. Unlearning is a process that requires love and support. Yes your girlfriend did the wrong thing in the past. Yes she needs to change. Ostracism isn\u2019t going to help her to come to new ways of being and thinking about others and their inherent worth and value. \n\nInducing that kind of shame is likely to both break her trust in you and the relationship whilst placing another barrier to growing as a human being and changing her views. \n\nI know this is an incredibly tough situation for you to be placed in. I can imagine it was heart wrenching to hear that someone you love has behaved this way. I\u2019m really sorry this has happened. \n\nIn future, if someone comes to you looking for support with something that makes you angry like this, it might be a better choice to let them know that you don\u2019t have capacity to support them with the issue and to help them find someone who does\u2026", "YTA\n\nShe has made bad decisions in the past, and now it comes back on her.\n\nYou should be supportive now.
