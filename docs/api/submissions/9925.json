I chose to enlist in the Marines instead of go to school like they wanted.  I kept it with them because I enlisted before 18.  Later on I asked them for my money.  \"What money?  That was payment for 17 years of room and board.\"", "While in dont agree with the parents decision, where you get this?", "To me, the method OP's parents use to teach their kids to save is the equivalent of very strictly enforcing no treats until they are 18, and then suddenly letting them have full control of their diet. Pretty much all of us will agree that that just causes people to go wild because they never actually learned methods of moderation themselves. They were always enforced by someone. \n\nTeaching your kid to save is great. But there should also come a time, while they are still within your household and cannot do tremendous amounts of damage to themselves and their credit, where you slowly put more and more control of their savings into their own hands, so they can actually *learn* to moderate their own behaviour. And most importantly, feel consequences for themselves. I'm not saying you give them their whole college fund and have fun with it. Let them decide their own saving goals (even if it is something you consider stupid as hell) Let them spend all their birthday money in one go, and then deal with the fact that they won't have anything to buy fun stuff with for months to come.", ">It can absolutely teach them how to be fiscally responsible\n\nStealing from your kid doesn't teach them fiscal responsibility. Or do you think that employers who engage in wage theft are teaching their employees \"fiscal responsibility\" too?", "But you can earn so much more much quicker at that age. If you're doing part time hours around school that's money you can theoretically save but a month or two at 21 will net you the same amount. Personally I'd be livid to have worked and had people take from my salary for any reason even at that age.", "Child labor?  I've been working since age 12.  When my friends were begging their parents for money on weekends, I had the funds to do whatever I wanted.", "You'd still need money to house and feed them though.", "People kick their dogs, should we operate under the assumption that OP's parents kick his dog? Even though he didn't mention anything whatsoever that leads us to believe this is true?", "I'd do this differently too (no sense having money just sitting collecting dust, it should be invested), but the act of putting money away to be spent later quite literally is saving money, just in the slowest, dumbest way to do it.", "Agreed, and I would do this differently.", "Did you read the rest of the words after \u201cforce them\u201d? Because I wrote \u201cto learn.\u201d Some kids learn to read easily and love it, some need tutors and hate it. Some kids (like my own) struggle with cleaning, and it takes lots of hard work on everyone\u2019s part to teach them how to do it. Others just naturally know how to clean. But it\u2019s still necessary to teach the reluctant reader and cleaner to read and clean, and that will mean forcing the issue.", "Of course not. But learning how to do things is hard, takes time, and doesn\u2019t always come easily or quickly.  Each of those examples takes more time than you think to learn, and often it is something a parent needs to push/force a child to practice to get it right. Learning how to be wise with money is not as simple as \u201cjust save money!\u201d Would I do what these parents are doing? No, because I\u2019d make sure they knew what I was doing with the extra 1/3 and have them also learn investing, but I also don\u2019t hate it as a lesson.", "I really wish my parents had cared more about teaching me financials and how to save, but they were not competent enough themselves to do it.", "This part matters. I think if parents are taking money from their kids and putting it in checking/savings accounts, then they should show their kids the statements and explain to them what they are looking at. Every month I give my son his bank statements.", "I didn't even think of it, but you brought up an excellent point. \n\nIt's a good idea for parents to teach children how to save. But part of saving is keeping track of your money, and being able to read a bank statement. Your parents teaching you this, and providing you with bank statements, not only instilled trust, but taught you a valuable skill. \n\nSo many people plow themselves deep into debt the moment they move out, because they were never taught about money. Financial literacy should be a part of every kid's education.", "I don't trust this stuff either... my mom put me in over $200k worth of debt.  it took me years to dig myself out of the hole.\n\nshe took every paycheck I earned... there's so much.... I wish reddit had been thing in the early 2000s", "This is straight up theft!!", "I remember the deal was I got forty bucks a month direct deposited into my bank account. This was in lieu of an allowance like my brother got. The deal was supposed to be then I'd have money to go on the special trips my school offered at the end of the year. So I'd save and never dip into it. But every time the trips rolled around, there was only ever twenty dollars in that account.\n\nMy Mom was dipping into it and not telling me, hoping she could replace the money before I noticed, but she never could. I remember one day she went to go withdraw from it.\n\n\"Okay, just put it back.\" Well, twenty dollars was going into it tomorrow, so it would be paid back immediately!!! I could not get her to understand that if she took twenty dollars from me and gave me twenty dollars that was already promised, she was still shorting me twenty dollars. \n\nThen she went  and bought two packs of cigarettes. I'm still salty about that.", "My parents would never have thought of taking my money. Mom was on my account and we had transfer privileges in case we needed to flip money to one another. \n\nOf course I was the only one to flip money because I was her online banker.", "How any parent can steal from their child is beyond me. My father used to do similar things. It\u2019s cruel and I\u2019m sorry you experienced that.", "Or, conversely, the parents are helping their children develop both the expectation and habit of saving and investing portions of their earnings now, while the kids are young, so that this behavior will continue as they get older.\n\nIt\u2019s like teaching your kids to brush their teeth.  I remind my 6 year old to brush (and help him brush them) twice a day. I do not remind my 19 year old, because I no longer have to - we built that habit when she was a child.  The parents here are trying to build a habit of saving money, a very valuable habit that will serve OP and her brother well in their future.  Sure, they could just let him do whatever he wants with his paycheck - it is his money.  But I can likely guarantee you that if they did, that paycheck would be spent before the next one arrived. (Speaking from the experience of being 18 and having raised one\u2026 I *definitely* should have done this when my kid got their first job.)", "I'm not saying either which way about the subject. But I will say because an 18 year old with that type of wad of cash won't do the same as 21 year old aging out of their college years. It'll give them a nice nest egg to come back to and a leg up many folks were never lucky enough to get. I'm *assuming* that's the thought process but we all know what ASSuming does lol. But I know in a general sense, as a momma myself, that is something I hope to do for my own (not necessarily take their money or anything but we will get to that bridge when it comes and one reason I don't necessarily have an opinion on the situation as a whole), but to slowly stash money away and then give it to them around that age (what they do with though, will be up to them but my hope is they use it wisely).", "The 21 part is geared to make sure they have money after university. One third for now, one third for university, one third for after university. That's not a bad idea.\n\nI'm sorry that your dad was dishonest. Is there any reason from the info OP has given to suggest her parents are the same?", "Moles don't need housing, they dig their own homes... You got me with the food though.", "Fair. Recruits for housing moles would likely be helpful.", "Jesus why is that your go to? But let's go with it. If a dog is super nervous and human aggressive esp with their owner, the POSSIBILITY of the dog having been kicked by their owner is definitely a possibility and is a legitimate concern that should be considered. However, that's not people assuming that the owner is definitely kicking the dog, there's other reasons why the dog could be very nervous and human aggressive that have nothing to do with the owner. \n\nNo one is saying that OP parents are definitely 100% financially abusing their kids. People are saying that there are some red flags that COULD be indicating fiancial abuse. Sure best case scenario OP has terrific parents who will never even accidentally lose or use their kids money and they will give their kids their money back once they are an adult even if they choose not to go to college. Great! That's fantastic and for OP and her brothers sake, I really hope that is what happens.\n\nBUT as a lot of people along with myself are pointing out, there ARE a lot of parents who aren't responsible with their kids money and have lost it unintentionally and/or parents who are purposefully withholding the money with no intention of giving it back. And letting OP know that this could be a possibility is important. I wish I had known about financial abuse when I was 17. I wish I knew all the different ways people could screw me over financially and how easy it is to put trust in parents who don't deserve that trust. OP needs to find out now. The sooner the better. If it's not financial abuse and the bank accounts are in the kids name and money can't be taken away or kept from them, then that's great. However, it's better to prepare for the possibility that the money won't be there, esp if there's no proof (which OP hasn't said one way or the other if there is).", "Theyre reluctant or won't do things because you're forcing them too. Teach them and show consequence. You'll be a better parent.", "The issue is that it's not doing what they intended. It's making at least the one kid hide things from his parents in order to hoard $3 and hour, to do what exactly? \n\nDriving your kids to hide things is one of the worst outcomes you can have as a parent. You don't know what they're up to. They might fear getting exposed. That in turn exposes the kids to dangers they don't need to be facing.", "Same. I set up online banking for my son when he got his phone, and showed him how to check his account. We direct deposit his pocket money.\n\nSurely the vast, vast majority of parents are decent and don't steal their kids' money.\n\nYTA, OP. Stay out of it!", "Should've taken her to court and filed a fraud report!", "Not legally if the parents are on the account. Lots of parents take advantage..", "Dw she stopped bc I found her cheating on my dad and she knew I'd squeal if she kept that up", "Making someone do something doesn't teach them anything. Discussing it, explaining it and letting them make the decision does. I'm tired of the bullshit \"it's for their benefit\" or \"they aren't responsible enough\". No, you just can't give a decent enough argument for doing the \"thing\" you want them to do.\n\nI have no doubt that you had this conversation regarding brushing teeth. If like my kids, they might need a little reminder from time to time. But they know why they are doing it and agree.", "Well, OP has not turned 21 yet so they have no way to confirm if they will keep their word.", "But if you just let them dig holes without limitation they could get away? I think an underground lair would be a good solution, quite large of course to allow for digging.", "And you\u2019d rather your dad get cheated on then lose a few dollars??", "Exactly, if you take control of the money you don't teach your children self control around money. I don't understand why so many people believe this - let them spend some and be broke at 18, then they'll be much more likely to save up later."]}
