It\u2019s hard enough as it is to find that as an adult and he\u2019s clearly doing something well to get that raise at his age, especially considering this is likely his first job and many places will not hire people under the age of 16.

This kid is doing well.\n\nSure, lying isn\u2019t a good thing, but at his age I understand wanting that extra spending money. He\u2019s still putting money away. Honestly I would\u2019ve done the same at his age, but that\u2019s because my parents did similar and told me they were putting money away that I would be given at some age (I think it was 21, but I can\u2019t remember) and I still had to put money into my own savings account. For me it just lead to my mom clearing out my savings and checking account often and spending it on herself, and the money they took to put aside for me was pocketed as well so I never received it. I am assuming that is not the case for OP and her brother, but it\u2019s still part of why I can understand not being 100% honest about pay.\n\nAnyways, at his age he most likely has an account connected to parents, so if they haven\u2019t noticed that his checks are bigger then oh well. I\u2019m assuming once the money goes into his account they still split it in thirds, so he may not even actually be pocketing the extra money. Unless he somehow gets paid in cash, which I\u2019m assuming he isn\u2019t since he gets paid hourly at a decently high hourly wage for his age. If he was a food runner or worked at a chain grocery store then he\u2019d be able to be partially paid in cash or cash his check, but most places seem to require direct deposit now.\n\nEither way, OP needs to mind her own.", "Technically he won\u2019t have less.

I paid off all my loans (which were pretty small thankfully) before interest kicked in and then ordered a new car. I could have spent way more money in college and been perfectly fine after graduating.\n\nWhen I was 15 I had even less spending money.  $30 a month would have gone a really long way when I was 15. If I could, I would have opened a line of credit to my teenager self for like $5k and happily paid it off in my 20s.

I think as a \u201crule\u201d it\u2019s pretty shit for your parents to impose that on both of you - it is your money and you have every right to use it however you see fit (though I do think it\u2019s a really smart way to make you two financially responsible and your parents would\u2019ve been smart to RECOMMEND the two of you to follow it). But trying to control your brother and force him to follow is only going to make him hate you (and likely his parents). He\u2019ll realise his mistake when he has less at 21 and for college, but that\u2019s his problem.

You should teach them how to maturely use money and long term effects. Otherwise they often never truly learn the value of money until they're older.

Filling out a refund like you did was only necessary because you didn't claim exempt, so filing a return is the only way to get your money back. Pretty sure you could have just not filed one and the IRS wouldn't care because it's obvious you didn't owe any money. Of course, very few average citizens know this, I didn't know it until I started college for accounting, but yeah. However, some people claim exempt bc they're like *hey then I get my money right away!* But then if they end up owing like 20k at the end of the year they're likely fucked. You can also offer to withold *more* tax from each paycheck than what is required, and then you'll get a bigger return (I don't see the point but my grandma apparently does this)\n\nI'm just an intern currently so I'm DEFINITELY not a tax expert, if any actual accountants want to correct me.

Good parents start teaching financial independence at a young age with better tactics. Forcing your child what to do with their job money breeds resentment, especially if the parents are not planning to help financially and you don't trust them to hold your money. Teaching saving as a parent is: oh, you want a car? We will match whatever you save. That's incentive without resentment. My parents always said they'd give me a dollar in my account (which they would show me) every time I ordered water instead of a soda. That taught me not to spend on frivolous things. When we'd go to Disney world they'd give each sibling a set amount of money ($20 when we were really young, $50 later on) that we could spend on stuff. If you want that plushie, t-shirt, whatever, it comes out of your money. If you didn't spend it, you keep it. I stopped buying \"junk\" before the age of 10. If I got money for birthdays, graduations, whatever, they would ask what I wanted to with it (typically right after receiving other presents) and because I didn't want anything in that moment I always asked them to save it for me, which they did. This is how good parents teach financial independence \n\nI'm sorry, but if you haven't taught your kids any kind of financial independence by the time they get a job and need to pay taxes, you're too late. I don't care if they're teenagers or not. If you are old enough to work and make money you are old enough to decide what happens to that money. What if OPs brother wants to do trade school or a degree the parents don't approve of? They can just pocket his money away and say \"too bad, it was only for college\".
