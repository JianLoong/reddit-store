However,. We moved in a few months ago so I have a rule that me and my husband came up with that at least one day a week, we take the kids out with their parent for bonding time just one on one.\n\nWe had this rule to ensure that neither of the kids feel like we are taking over and they don\u2019t have their parent their anymore.

The rest of the week we go on together as a family. \n\nSo the other day my husband, Maxine and Lana, were going out and me and Valentina were going out. before they left Valentina said she wanted to go with them. First the kids didn\u2019t look to up to it and didn\u2019t seem to share her excitement,They were talking all week about how they were gonna go to the zoo with their dad, I didn\u2019t want to take that. \n\nI hadn\u2019t told Valentina what we were doing that day yet so it was a surprise. So I said we are going somewhere else, She got upset and said she wanted to go to the zoo. \n\nI said that this was their time, and we are going to have a lot of fun at where we are going. She started getting fussy about it and my husband said to just let her. But I said no, one once she finds out where we are going she\u2019s gonna throw another fit and two, I need her to understand that sometimes they will go out just them, and if I indulge in her fit she will keep doing it. \n\nAt that point I had decided to just tell her where we are going and Instantly her tears went away.\n\n They left, all of us had a great time and every kid was happy, however my husband said that I should\u2019ve just let her come with them, and that he wants her to feel like she\u2019s apart of the family. \n\nI again told him I know he wants that, and she\u2019s made herself right at home, but they need to know that they can still have daddy and daughter time, just them and vise versa. This is a big change, they are still little and I just wanna make sure that we are handling this in a way that everyone\u2019s happy and no one feeling neglected. \n\nI suggested since we are always blended with the kids all together or apart, we could make it a priority to take out Valentina with him and Maxine and Lana with me. So we have our time together and apart and switched, and gives us all a chance to bond together. \n\nHe liked the idea but is still upset that I didn\u2019t let her come with because he wants to make her feel like she\u2019s in the family too. And doesn\u2019t like that she didn\u2019t come with. \n\nI feel like everyone\u2019s trying their best here, everyone wants the best for the kids, but I don\u2019t know a better compromise.

You seem like an amazing step mom who has everyone\u2019s best interest in mind, so you are definitely N T A for that.\n\nHowever, be weary that these constant switches may end up backfiring. My feeling is that parents having different kids on different days will happen organically, and you trying to control the situation may end up posing as more of a threat than a bonding moment. \n\nJust keep lines of communication open and be thankful that your daughter WANTS to spend time with her step dad and step siblings.", "NAH because I can see how hard you're both trying to make this transition easier and smooth for everyone. Not gonna call you an AH for that. And I also agree with your reasoning that the girls were looking forward to their dad time and it wasn't fair to let Valentina crash that because she was having a tantrum. Your plan for the future sounds good.\n\nBut also, I would maybe try and keep these outings as surprises until the day of. If Valentina had been hearing all week about her step-siblings fun trip to the zoo that she wasn't invited to, yeah that's probably gonna make her feel left out and hurt.", "NAH but you may want to consider that keeping your fun activity a secret while the others were taking about theirs all week was setting your daughter up for failure. Any kid would be upset in that situation. Poor planning.", "NAH\n\nLooks like everyone just wants everyone to be happy and this is an adjustment period. I think bio-parent time, step-parent time and blended time is a wonderful way to make sure all the kids know they're equally loved and there's no resentment. As they get older and more used to being siblings, things can probably become more totally blended, but for now it sounds perfect.", "NAH. It's a difficult one. I totally understand why you made the choice to not do it, but I also totally get your husband why he did want to take her. So nobody is wrong.\n\nBut maybe it's an idea to just sit the children down, even when they're young and maybe don't understand yet, and just ask what they want?\n\nMaybe one on one time instead of your husband taking the two and you one would be an idea? So everyone has a one on one date like once a month/once every two months. One with you and one with your husband? That way it's not one kid being left out.", "NAH\n\nSeems like you\u2019re both just trying your best to do the right thing for all of these children. That can\u2019t be a bad thing.\nI can\u2019t give advice on this topic, but good luck with it all. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll work it out.", "Nobody's an AH here, you are both trying hard to make all the kids feel happy and loved.  I personally think once a week for \"separate\" time is too often.  You are a blended family now, so the majority focus should be on that, not a constant reminder of separateness.  I think once a month alone time would be more beneficial and healthy.", "NAH\n\nBoth you and your husband have good points.\n\nWhy not alternate? One weekend go out as a family, the next each parent takes their own kid(s), and the next you swap kids.\n\nOr Saturday mornings are for one one one parent/kid time, Tuesday night is family night with movies or board games, and once a month you swap kids for a few hours.", "NTA, parenting is hard enough without the little ones throwing a hissy fit at some point. There is no right or wrong and what you have done seems to be a win-win for everyone. The 7 year old has long gotten over the incident and doubt if she doesn't feel part of the family. Adults has to just let go and move on with the lives and as you mentioned, if you let the kids make decisions, they end up wanting more of it. So its good to stick to your agreed plans and get on with it. Talk to your husband and I am sure he will come around. Good to see a family who looks after everyone and does things to make it all work.

You going out of your way to rigidly enforce your vision of things at the direct expense of your child was an asshole move. All week her siblings were talking about the cool trip they were going on, and she wanted to go spend time with her dad and her siblings. Instead because it's what you wanted to do you forced her to go with you and excluded her from spending time with her dad and her siblings.\n\nYour actions in this incident was you enforcing that you aren't a blended family, that she's your kid and that she is separate and different from the other kids. Your husband has a right to be upset and call you out on it because the behavior works against the goal you both said you were doing this for and it was mean.\n\nThe better compromise is to listen to the kids", "NTA and I agree that giving Maxine and Lana time with their dad is important, and I commend you on not only making that rule, but sticking to it. I think that his kids are young to  be able to voice their wants and concerns and it's very good that you're making an effort to prioritize their relationship with their dad so that they don't feel pushed aside or dismissed. I hope you are open with them about your thoughts and motivations and tell them you will always be interested in knowing their feelings and try to respect them. The thing is, I'm sure your husband means well and thinks that they are all so young they won't really be bothered by sharing all together and I'm sure he wants to create a happy, healthy family. But that will take time and careful listening and respect to manage successfully. You're doing it right.", "Got mixed feelings on this one. I can definitely understand where you\u2019re coming from but it also feels like this could drive a wedge between the children and give them a \u201cus vs them\u201d mentality", "Maybe do the 1:1 thing less often so it doesn't feel forced to the kids, which is what it seems like in the zoo instance.", "No I think she's right.  His kids weren't happy to have their stepsister shove in on their time.\n\nHowever they do need to learn not to brag about what they're doing when someone else isn't involved.", "Yeah I agree", "The reason I don\u2019t think your first option is the best is because that is very spaced out and we already have a really busy week, so the weekends are where we mostly get family time or one on one time, and while I am trying to make it known that I\u2019m not here to take their dad away I am still trying to create a blended family, so I think a few hours a week is a bit better for our goal in this. \n\nFor your second option it\u2019s kind of what we do already but less structured, So really we just don\u2019t have a set and stone date for the kids, it\u2019s really just once a week that we talk about before we start the week tell the kids and then go from there,", "I\u2019m sorry you see it that way however, it\u2019s not just about my kid, it\u2019s about them as well, and their reaction showed that they wanted this time with their dad. \n\nThis is such an issue in blended family\u2019s, I just got here, they\u2019ve that their dad to themselves for a while, so they do get to have their time with their dad. How is it fair for me to force my kid into their time because that\u2019s what she wanted? No, it\u2019s about what everyone wants. You don\u2019t have to constantly be together to have a blended family but we quite literally spend we spend every minute together despite these few hours in a week, The kids very clearly represented that they wanted to have this time with their father, and my kid was very happy when I told her what we were going to do, my only wrong move was not telling her which I will admit wasn\u2019t the brightest idea, I was trying to surprise her with something so that\u2019s my fault. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t go against the goal we had set in place the goal was for the kids to no we aren\u2019t taking them away from their parents and they to get to be with their parents if they choose to. We made a compromise, we will do something together tomorrow, and I know for a fact that if I hadn\u2019t told her and let her go go the zoo she would\u2019ve been more upset had i canceled the plans. \n\nWe are together 6 days out of the week, 24/7 always doing things together, this one day it meant for them. And the reason she wanted to go so bad was because she didn\u2019t know what we were doing, then I told her which I admit was my mistake. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that not letting her go means I\u2019m trying to keep her away from her siblings. They are always together.\n\nI find it weird that everyone has this take on blended family\u2019s needing to be together 24/7 to make it a blended family. Which we pretty much are. \n\nAnd as hard as it may be to hear, this isn\u2019t Ja\u00edr about my kids feelings, it\u2019s not going to be her way or the highway, Maxine and Lana were visibly not liking the idea, that\u2019s not exactly fair to them to take that either. \n\nBut again it was my fault to not tell her so that my was my mistake and I understand why she got upset. Overall I\u2019m not going to just not allow them to have their time, because doing that doesn\u2019t mean that we aren\u2019t a blended family what so ever, but I will try to make different  accommodations and figure out what\u2019s best.", "I could understand how that may be however it\u2019s not a, I don\u2019t know a good way to describe it or explain, it\u2019s just very normal since we have been doing it since I got here and there has been no issue since then. \n\nI think that my mistake was not telling her where we were going so she really just heard where they were going and that\u2019s what got her so frustrated.because we never have had an issue with this but this is also the first time I\u2019ve not told her before hand where we are going. \n\nBut I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not going to just have my daughter go every time, when they were visibly not liking the idea of her coming, since they were looking forward to to this, so I am trying to figure out a happy medium.", "I think you and your husband need to discuss how to teach the kids the etiquette that they shouldn't discuss plans with someone who isn't involved.  Your daughter wouldn't feel left out if they didn't spend a week gushing about the zoo.\n\nI would also ask your husband how he would feel if his daughters refused to go with him and wanted to go with you and your daughter instead. Especially if it was because you and your daughter spent a week gushing about how much fun you were going to have without them.", "Honestly I think working it into the week is a better option.  Is there nothing your husband does around the house that they can help him with? Or have him help with homework? \n\nThese weekend outings aren't likely to be practical longterm and it's more effective to weave quality time in.\n\nPlus right now neither of his daughters are getting one to one time with their dad.", "it wasn\u2019t really rubbing it in her face or anything, it was really just a \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d Type of thing but I get what your saying. I think me not telling Valentina was the biggest issue here though so it\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to look out for in the future. I don\u2019t want it to be a competition or a long term issue. Usually they talk between eachother about what they will be doing and share excitement, first time this has really occurred so it\u2019s just something to look out for in my end. \n\nyes, if the roles were reversed I think it would give a much different perspective to my husband. It\u2019s difficult to come to compromises like this at times.", "Totally NTA", " It's still rude. They should learn not to do it because friends and colleagues don't appreciate that behavior, either.", "NAH. I think your main issue here was lack of transparency with Valentina.  Did she know all week she wasn't going to the zoo?  Did she know you also had a fun plan?  I understand the impulse to stage \"surprises\", but honestly, this age group doesn't do very well with them.\n\nIf you don't have one, and big whiteboard family calendar is a great idea.   If the kids know all week that on Saturday Maxine and Lena are going to the zoo with Dad, and Valentina is going to the science centre with Mum, and then everyone is meeting up for dinner after, then the whole thing becomes much easier.  Especially if they can see that next week Valentina gets to go to the zoo, and Maxine and Lena get to go to the science centre.  FOMO  is huge with kids, and when everything seems like a \"special surprise, once in a lifetime outing!\", then it just gets worse.  Making the plans transparent, and having the girls be a part of planning when possible will really make the whole thing less stressful.", "NAH\nIt's only a few months that your family blended.\n\nIn future, you and your husband should make sure your bio-parent/child bonding times shouldn't make the other kid(s) feel like they're missing out on a special treat. A movie, a meal, a park, even a special snuggly time sharing a story can be 1 on 1 bonding activities.\n\nBeing more specific with your 7 year old when she felt excluded rather than making her wait longer to learn your plans would have deescalated the situation faster.\n\nI suggest you and your husband should make efforts to spend some 1 on 1 time with each individual child regularly. Treating his kids as a unit can foster other problems. A \"team Dad/team Mom\" division deepening between the kids, and possibly extending to you and your husband is one.  His children getting little 1 on 1 time because they're always planned as a unit is another.\n\nReally special places and events should be for all the kids, the blended family. 1 on 1 bonding time with parents shouldn't be so infrequent that it's a special event when it happens.", "I think you mean well so NTA also but perhaps you're not considering it from your daughter's point of view and may therefore intentionally become TA. Remember he has 2 daughters not just one, so your daughter may feel like she is being left out, which the other girls won't feel when you take your daughter out as it's not only one child being left out. It's quite mean on your daughter and will likely get worse as she gets older. Maybe it would be best if his alone time with his daughters are 1 on 1 rather than both together. \n\nI think you are also unintentionally putting up a clear divide making it seem like your daughter and his kids, rather than \"our kids\" and one family. It may be a good idea to not have such rigid rules in place and always extend invite to all kidd rather than you intentionally taking just your daughter out and same with him and his. But tell all 3 kids that if ever they want alone time with either parent then to say and you will arrange a special day (so if one of his wanted a day out with you or his daughter wanted a day out with him then that would be fine, but also provides opportunity to have alone time with bio parent)", "Even then though it will still always be V who is left out as she is always the one alone whilst the other kids go together. I can see how she would feel left out. Maybe dad needs to take his girls out individually for one on one time rather than both together as that's where V probs feels like the outsider with the other two", "This. When he plans on what day he's taking his daughters somewhere he needs not tell anyone where he plans to take them and vice versa. But they do need to make a switch. She takes his girls somewhere and he takes her daughter somewhere.", "This..I think Dad wasn\u2019t in tune with what the girls wanted, and she picked right!", "Are you together 24/7 the rest of the week though? With work and school I feel like I only see my kids at the weekend - I see them for about 5 minutes before I leave for work and about 1-2 hours maximum in the evening before they go to bed.\nA day every single week with x goes with mum and y goes with dad would in my house mean actual family Time would be incredibly limited and probably half taken up with all the stuff that has to happen to run a household (chores etc).\nWould once a month for the split family time not be better?", "NTA. Your idea is great. Do not deviate unless all three children want it to change. \nThis is such a nice change from the step parent pushing everyone together regardless of who it hurts. Again, you are doing a wonderful job. Where did you go with your daughter?", "Hey there, I know it isn\u2019t quite the same situation but I just wanted to chime in since there are 3 of them. I grew up with identical twin sisters, I am the oldest. I was ALWAYS excluded because they were a package deal. They wanted to take dance class? That\u2019s THEIR thing. They want to hang out with a parent, it\u2019s the two of them. I\u2019d be a little worried about your daughter eventually feeling like the odd one out as the other two are sharing all the same memories and experiences. It might be a good idea as well to do one on one dates with the kiddos so everyone gets time but also it\u2019s not always just excluding the one kid. I mean yes he should still get time with both of them but just maybe not every single time y\u2019know? NAH", "NTA", "I completely get my daughters perspective which Is why I\u2019ve stated that in the future i won\u2019t be holding anything for surprises, as I haven\u2019t in the situation and this is the first of this situation, but it was also not just her perspective and caused by me, and It was ancient history once she found out where we were going and went to go get ready. \n\nLike I\u2019ve stated, this isn\u2019t as much of a complex agreement or something that consistently causes issues. as this story shows and besides this which I admit was on me for keeping it is something all the kids look forward to. But I\u2019m not here just forcing them to be apart if that\u2019s what was interpreted,\n\nThe purpose of this was so they don\u2019t feel like any of us are taking the parents away, they are little and don\u2019t understand communication as well as we might think, so when they are feeling big emotions, or like they want to be with their father, sometimes they won\u2019t just tell you, so that\u2019s another reason why this is a prominent agreement,\n\nI think this was just caused by me not saying where we are going and that\u2019s what made her feel left out, as this has for the last few months been something they like. \n\nIn my opinion based on my kids and theirs, the one day a week isn\u2019t an issue but the communication on my part was. Now if this continues to be an issue or something that isn\u2019t because I decided to try and surprise her, or that anyone feels left out I\u2019d gladly make accommodations and different agreements to what we normally do and find a happy medium.\n\nWhen they are older and able to communicate better then they do now, by my experience with how they all perceive things and express emotions or feelings, Id of course be willing to switch up so everyone is happy. \n\nBut for now I think that I had just wanted to surprise her and didn\u2019t think about the other side of that until after. \n\nBut again if this continues to be an issue, I\u2019m more than happy to change what I am doing,", "You obviously mean well and it's great you are thinking about step kids too. But just be mindful that in time she might wonder why the other two girls get to do stuff that she can do with them (again, they won't feel the same other way round as it's not just one of the 3 being left out). Which is why maybe it would be worth considering dad doing one on one stuff with his daughters separately so all kids feel like they have their own special time with their parent that's just about them, but at no point will only one of the 3 kids be left out of an outing. \n\nAs what was a child with 2 half brothers, I would have hated them doing stuff with and not being invited to join and being the only kid left out", "I work from home so I very rarely go into my job, they get out at 2pm and only have extra curriculars two days out of the week, I\u2019m normally the one to pick up, dads the one to drop off, everything else we all do together, so I see them pretty frequently. One of the perks of having a very time flexible job I make my own hours as well. So most of the time I\u2019m with them, he gets out of work early to. \n\nI\u2019m thinking that if this persist\u2019s and this wasn\u2019t just her feeling excluded because she didn\u2019t know where we were going, then I\u2019d work out some different ideas", "They're 6 and 8 for christ's sake. They should be free to express joy and excitement within their own family. One day it will be Valentina doing the exciting thing and hopefully her stepsiblings will be gracious and happy for her. As long as they weren't doing it in a malicious and boastful way, they're fine."]}
