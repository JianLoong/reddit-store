However,. We moved in a few months ago so I have a rule that me and my husband came up with that at least one day a week, we take the kids out with their parent for bonding time just one on one.\n\nWe had this rule to ensure that neither of the kids feel like we are taking over and they don\u2019t have their parent their anymore. I don\u2019t want his kids to feel like I\u2019m taking him away from them and vise versa. The rest of the week we go on together as a family. \n\nSo the other day my husband, Maxine and Lana, were going out and me and Valentina were going out. before they left Valentina said she wanted to go with them. First the kids didn\u2019t look to up to it and didn\u2019t seem to share her excitement,They were talking all week about how they were gonna go to the zoo with their dad, I didn\u2019t want to take that. \n\nI hadn\u2019t told Valentina what we were doing that day yet so it was a surprise. So I said we are going somewhere else, She got upset and said she wanted to go to the zoo. \n\nI said that this was their time, and we are going to have a lot of fun at where we are going. She started getting fussy about it and my husband said to just let her. But I said no, one once she finds out where we are going she\u2019s gonna throw another fit and two, I need her to understand that sometimes they will go out just them, and if I indulge in her fit she will keep doing it. \n\nAt that point I had decided to just tell her where we are going and Instantly her tears went away.\n\n They left, all of us had a great time and every kid was happy, however my husband said that I should\u2019ve just let her come with them, and that he wants her to feel like she\u2019s apart of the family. \n\nI again told him I know he wants that, and she\u2019s made herself right at home, but they need to know that they can still have daddy and daughter time, just them and vise versa. This is a big change, they are still little and I just wanna make sure that we are handling this in a way that everyone\u2019s happy and no one feeling neglected. \n\nI suggested since we are always blended with the kids all together or apart, we could make it a priority to take out Valentina with him and Maxine and Lana with me. So we have our time together and apart and switched, and gives us all a chance to bond together. \n\nHe liked the idea but is still upset that I didn\u2019t let her come with because he wants to make her feel like she\u2019s in the family too. And doesn\u2019t like that she didn\u2019t come with. \n\nI feel like everyone\u2019s trying their best here, everyone wants the best for the kids, but I don\u2019t know a better compromise. I feel like just always having the kids together, and never 1 on 1 time, will sooner or later cause issues.", "created_utc": 1671368346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoy2jy/aita_for_telling_my_husband_and_my_kid_that_they/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You seem like an amazing step mom who has everyone\u2019s best interest in mind, so you are definitely N T A for that.\n\nHowever, be weary that these constant switches may end up backfiring. My feeling is that parents having different kids on different days will happen organically, and you trying to control the situation may end up posing as more of a threat than a bonding moment. \n\nJust keep lines of communication open and be thankful that your daughter WANTS to spend time with her step dad and step siblings.", "NAH because I can see how hard you're both trying to make this transition easier and smooth for everyone. Not gonna call you an AH for that. And I also agree with your reasoning that the girls were looking forward to their dad time and it wasn't fair to let Valentina crash that because she was having a tantrum. Your plan for the future sounds good.\n\nBut also, I would maybe try and keep these outings as surprises until the day of. If Valentina had been hearing all week about her step-siblings fun trip to the zoo that she wasn't invited to, yeah that's probably gonna make her feel left out and hurt.", "NAH but you may want to consider that keeping your fun activity a secret while the others were taking about theirs all week was setting your daughter up for failure. Any kid would be upset in that situation. Poor planning.", "NAH\n\nLooks like everyone just wants everyone to be happy and this is an adjustment period. I think bio-parent time, step-parent time and blended time is a wonderful way to make sure all the kids know they're equally loved and there's no resentment. As they get older and more used to being siblings, things can probably become more totally blended, but for now it sounds perfect.", "NAH. It's a difficult one. I totally understand why you made the choice to not do it, but I also totally get your husband why he did want to take her. So nobody is wrong.\n\nBut maybe it's an idea to just sit the children down, even when they're young and maybe don't understand yet, and just ask what they want?\n\nMaybe one on one time instead of your husband taking the two and you one would be an idea? So everyone has a one on one date like once a month/once every two months. One with you and one with your husband? That way it's not one kid being left out.", "NAH\n\nSeems like you\u2019re both just trying your best to do the right thing for all of these children. That can\u2019t be a bad thing.\nI can\u2019t give advice on this topic, but good luck with it all. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll work it out.", "Nobody's an AH here, you are both trying hard to make all the kids feel happy and loved.  I personally think once a week for \"separate\" time is too often.  You are a blended family now, so the majority focus should be on that, not a constant reminder of separateness.  I think once a month alone time would be more beneficial and healthy.", "NAH\n\nBoth you and your husband have good points.\n\nWhy not alternate? One weekend go out as a family, the next each parent takes their own kid(s), and the next you swap kids.\n\nOr Saturday mornings are for one one one parent/kid time, Tuesday night is family night with movies or board games, and once a month you swap kids for a few hours.", "NTA, parenting is hard enough without the little ones throwing a hissy fit at some point. There is no right or wrong and what you have done seems to be a win-win for everyone. The 7 year old has long gotten over the incident and doubt if she doesn't feel part of the family. Adults has to just let go and move on with the lives and as you mentioned, if you let the kids make decisions, they end up wanting more of it. So its good to stick to your agreed plans and get on with it. Talk to your husband and I am sure he will come around. Good to see a family who looks after everyone and does things to make it all work. Hats off to you mama for the awesome effort you are putting in and the kids are lucky to have you in their life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You going out of your way to rigidly enforce your vision of things at the direct expense of your child was an asshole move. All week her siblings were talking about the cool trip they were going on, and she wanted to go spend time with her dad and her siblings. Instead because it's what you wanted to do you forced her to go with you and excluded her from spending time with her dad and her siblings.\n\nYour actions in this incident was you enforcing that you aren't a blended family, that she's your kid and that she is separate and different from the other kids. Your husband has a right to be upset and call you out on it because the behavior works against the goal you both said you were doing this for and it was mean.\n\nThe better compromise is to listen to the kids", "NTA and I agree that giving Maxine and Lana time with their dad is important, and I commend you on not only making that rule, but sticking to it. I think that his kids are young to  be able to voice their wants and concerns and it's very good that you're making an effort to prioritize their relationship with their dad so that they don't feel pushed aside or dismissed. I hope you are open with them about your thoughts and motivations and tell them you will always be interested in knowing their feelings and try to respect them. The thing is, I'm sure your husband means well and thinks that they are all so young they won't really be bothered by sharing all together and I'm sure he wants to create a happy, healthy family. But that will take time and careful listening and respect to manage successfully. You're doing it right.", "Got mixed feelings on this one. I can definitely understand where you\u2019re coming from but it also feels like this could drive a wedge between the children and give them a \u201cus vs them\u201d mentality", "Maybe do the 1:1 thing less often so it doesn't feel forced to the kids, which is what it seems like in the zoo instance.", "No I think she's right.  His kids weren't happy to have their stepsister shove in on their time.\n\nHowever they do need to learn not to brag about what they're doing when someone else isn't involved.", "Yeah I agree", "The reason I don\u2019t think your first option is the best is because that is very spaced out and we already have a really busy week, so the weekends are where we mostly get family time or one on one time, and while I am trying to make it known that I\u2019m not here to take their dad away I am still trying to create a blended family, so I think a few hours a week is a bit better for our goal in this. \n\nFor your second option it\u2019s kind of what we do already but less structured, So really we just don\u2019t have a set and stone date for the kids, it\u2019s really just once a week that we talk about before we start the week tell the kids and then go from there,", "I\u2019m sorry you see it that way however, it\u2019s not just about my kid, it\u2019s about them as well, and their reaction showed that they wanted this time with their dad. \n\nThis is such an issue in blended family\u2019s, I just got here, they\u2019ve that their dad to themselves for a while, so they do get to have their time with their dad. How is it fair for me to force my kid into their time because that\u2019s what she wanted? No, it\u2019s about what everyone wants. You don\u2019t have to constantly be together to have a blended family but we quite literally spend we spend every minute together despite these few hours in a week, The kids very clearly represented that they wanted to have this time with their father, and my kid was very happy when I told her what we were going to do, my only wrong move was not telling her which I will admit wasn\u2019t the brightest idea, I was trying to surprise her with something so that\u2019s my fault. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t go against the goal we had set in place the goal was for the kids to no we aren\u2019t taking them away from their parents and they to get to be with their parents if they choose to. We made a compromise, we will do something together tomorrow, and I know for a fact that if I hadn\u2019t told her and let her go go the zoo she would\u2019ve been more upset had i canceled the plans. \n\nWe are together 6 days out of the week, 24/7 always doing things together, this one day it meant for them. And the reason she wanted to go so bad was because she didn\u2019t know what we were doing, then I told her which I admit was my mistake. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that not letting her go means I\u2019m trying to keep her away from her siblings. They are always together.\n\nI find it weird that everyone has this take on blended family\u2019s needing to be together 24/7 to make it a blended family. Which we pretty much are. \n\nAnd as hard as it may be to hear, this isn\u2019t Ja\u00edr about my kids feelings, it\u2019s not going to be her way or the highway, Maxine and Lana were visibly not liking the idea, that\u2019s not exactly fair to them to take that either. \n\nBut again it was my fault to not tell her so that my was my mistake and I understand why she got upset. Overall I\u2019m not going to just not allow them to have their time, because doing that doesn\u2019t mean that we aren\u2019t a blended family what so ever, but I will try to make different  accommodations and figure out what\u2019s best.", "I could understand how that may be however it\u2019s not a, I don\u2019t know a good way to describe it or explain, it\u2019s just very normal since we have been doing it since I got here and there has been no issue since then. \n\nI think that my mistake was not telling her where we were going so she really just heard where they were going and that\u2019s what got her so frustrated.because we never have had an issue with this but this is also the first time I\u2019ve not told her before hand where we are going. \n\nBut I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not going to just have my daughter go every time, when they were visibly not liking the idea of her coming, since they were looking forward to to this, so I am trying to figure out a happy medium.", "I think you and your husband need to discuss how to teach the kids the etiquette that they shouldn't discuss plans with someone who isn't involved.  Your daughter wouldn't feel left out if they didn't spend a week gushing about the zoo.\n\nI would also ask your husband how he would feel if his daughters refused to go with him and wanted to go with you and your daughter instead. Especially if it was because you and your daughter spent a week gushing about how much fun you were going to have without them.", "Honestly I think working it into the week is a better option.  Is there nothing your husband does around the house that they can help him with? Or have him help with homework? \n\nThese weekend outings aren't likely to be practical longterm and it's more effective to weave quality time in.\n\nPlus right now neither of his daughters are getting one to one time with their dad.", "it wasn\u2019t really rubbing it in her face or anything, it was really just a \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d Type of thing but I get what your saying. I think me not telling Valentina was the biggest issue here though so it\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to look out for in the future. I don\u2019t want it to be a competition or a long term issue. Usually they talk between eachother about what they will be doing and share excitement, first time this has really occurred so it\u2019s just something to look out for in my end. \n\nyes, if the roles were reversed I think it would give a much different perspective to my husband. It\u2019s difficult to come to compromises like this at times.", "Totally NTA", " It's still rude. They should learn not to do it because friends and colleagues don't appreciate that behavior, either."]}
