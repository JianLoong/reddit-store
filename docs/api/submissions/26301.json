She was a twin and her sister unfortunately passed a few hours after birth. This is obviously very upsetting for all members of the family and a horrible situation to be handed. However me and my cousin are extremely close and every single birthday she has had has also been about her twin sister. Her mum will always put a little fancy background with her twins ashes and make my cousin take photos with it every birthday. She always posts \u201chappy birthday to my 2 beautiful girls\u201d up until my cousin was about 6 she was ok with this however since then she always expresses how she no longer feels like her birthdays are important anymore as it makes her mother upset due to the reminder and also because she feels everyone only talks about her twin and how they are so sorry for her loss. She doesn\u2019t feel like an individual person and constantly feels attached to her dead twin. \n\nLast night I asked her what she was doing for her birthday. She said her dad had wanted to take her to Spain but her mother said no because \u201cI don\u2019t think we can take the ashes overseas and it\u2019s too risky to bring Layla (the twin who passed) in case something happens\u201d this upset me a little as her 18th is a big birthday and she is being held back by her sister who A. Isn\u2019t alive and B. She doesn\u2019t even remember. I asked her if she\u2019s told her mum how upset she gets about her birthdays and how she doesn\u2019t feel like she can be an individual. She said she doesn\u2019t want to upset her mum so hasn\u2019t told her. Today at a family gathering my aunt was talking about how excited she is for the photographer to take pictures of my cousin and Laylas urn. I pulled her to one side and said we all understand how she feels but that she needs to get over and accept that Layla is gone and focus on her living daughter. She was extremely offended even after I told her how my cousin feels. She has uninvited me from my cousins birthday.

It is just never going to be helpful or effective to tell somebody to \"get over\" their child's death. It would have been much better for you to simply say you think that your cousin should be able to go on the trip, without it being hampered by the death of her sister, and that it has got to be tough to live all ones birthdays under the shadow of the sibling who didn't survive. The aunt wouldn't like it, but it's much more for her to chew on, and less outright offensive than telling somebody to 'get over' their daughters death!!!

You can show support to your cousin and encourage her to work through HER issues with HER mother. Grief is a big deal and absolutely not something that everyone processes even remotely the same. Your aunt is dealing with trying to celebrate your cousin and celebrate the life of her deceased sister. Being happy for one child on the same day you lost another is extremely complicated emotionally. It\u2019s no one\u2019s place to tell her how to grieve or honor unless the intended recipient has an issue, as in this case, at which point it is between the two of them to talk through their feelings and evolve to a better place together or to establish clear boundaries now that they are both adults.", "YTA.

Are my surviving children aware of their brothers who never had a chance at life? Yes, of course. But it\u2019s not such a defining part of their life that their own lives are overshadowed and limited by that. They never knew their brothers and it would be weird and creepy to try to force a relationship with ghosts purely for my benefit. At most they need to be aware because my pregnancy issues likely have a genetic component (my mother and her mother had similar complications), and they deserve to know should those issues be passed on to any daughters they might have. \n\nAunt needs therapy. She\u2019s on a path to lose her living daughter as well. My heart breaks for cousin.", "It's so painful that she probably just shut out what OP was saying, will dimiss it because OP has no idea what she's going through and will dig in deeper because she was challenged.\n\nThe message was good but the delivery was not. It should have come from someone the aunt will listen to. If I had lost a child and an 18-year-old told me they know how I feel I probably would have done more than just univite them from a party", "This woman is going to lose *two* daughters from her life if she keeps this behavior up.", "OP is the AH if that\u2019s how the conversation went. Pulling her aside at a family gathering and just blurting out \u201cyou need to accept that she\u2019s gone and focus on your living daughter\u201d isn\u2019t productive. This should have been a private conversation, with the focus put on the cousin\u2019s needs, not the mom\u2019s failures", "The only people who need therapy are the people who continually post on this sub lol. None of you are right in the head", "That's assuming father is willing to go against mother.", "*I", "I knew a twin like this except they were a few months old and conjoined (sister didn't survive the surgery.\n\nEvery birthday they would have a joint cake of Happy Birthday D1 Remembering D2 and that was it. (Well unless you count the hauntings through out the year, babysitting overnight once was enough for me even when I knew what would happen and how to stop it.)", "Just wait until Cousin is getting married and mom wants her to make the urn MOH and carry it down the aisle. And then later name any granddaughters after her.", "My uncle has tried but she always goes off on him about how disrespectful he is \nso he keeps silent to keep peace I guess.", "I agree, except there's nothing unintentional about it. She doesn't want her living daughter to have any kind of joy in life because her twin can't.", "He might not be, and just going along with his wife.", "The aunt is absolutely an asshole for saying the uncle can't take Op's cousin to Spain because they couldn't take the ashes", "That isn\u2019t how grief works but her grief has negatively affected people in her life. It\u2019s been 18 years and her behavior has most likely caused childhood trauma in her living child. Grief isn\u2019t linear but there is a point where others don\u2019t have to accept bad behavior because of \u201cgrief\u201d. That mother is behaving horribly and probably doesn\u2019t realize how horrible her actions have been to the living. Extensive grief therapy is needed here.", "I can\u2019t imagine ever getting over the loss of a child. But sympathy for her is out the door when she let her grief negatively affect her living child. Her grief has traumatized her child and probably given her so many issues. Yeah it\u2019s literally the worst thing to happen to anyone but it doesn\u2019t give you a pass to act like this. Her behavior is horrid to the living twin. As a parent you cannot be swallowed by grief if you have living kids.", "Right?? It sounds like OP's aunt will either continue to prevent her daughter from experiencing things because \"what about Layla\" or, even worse, will try to make her living daughter live life according to what Layla would have wanted (what school would she have wanted to go to, what job, etc)...Aunt needs serious therapy before her remaining daughter cuts her out of her life.", "My heart goes out to OP's cousin for having such an opportunity ruined because her mother is more concerned about an urn than her living, breathing daughter. I can't imagine how the cousin must feel knowing her dead twin's ashes are prioritized over her.\n\nHow long does OP's aunt intend to continue this? Will she want to include the urn in graduation pictures? Wedding pictures? I would be horrified.", "I think I remember that one! It's just awful how grief can blind people to the effect their actions have on others..I can't imagine going through life feeling like nothing I do is ever enough because of a tragedy.", "I'm so sorry for your losses, and I agree there are just some things that you don't \"get over\" but rather learn to live with. It sounds like OP's aunt is trying to live with it by forcing a relationship between her surviving daughter and the deceased baby, which isn't healthy for any party involved. Surely there are ways to acknowledge her deceased child without making her living one feel like she's playing second fiddle, but that seems like the sort of thing the aunt would have to discuss in therapy. I hope the aunt finds a healthier way to live with her grief than impeding her other child's life.", "We don't know how old the OP is.", "And yet, here you are\u2026", "There's the problem. He hasn't so far.", "We have no evidence that the father has done much of anything so far. Even if he's tried to get his wife into therapy, he needs to intervene with regards to her behaviour to her living daughter.", "You're really just going to throw out there that the dead sibling haunted the family and then just...not tell us?", "> Every birthday they would have a joint cake of Happy Birthday D1 Remembering D2\n\nI feel sorry for D1 who never had a birthday without being reminded of a dead sibling.", "Uncle needs to take your cousin on the trip without your aunt. Tell him to make the trip a few weeks after the actual birthday if he feels that's better, but he needs to start defending her daughter.\nWhat if your cousin gets married? Is auntie going to make her have the urn as maid of honor?", "That doesn\u2019t make it any better. If my husband wrecked a holiday I wanted to take my daughter on like that, and repeatedly took away any agency and individualism in my child like she is, there would be severe issues and I wouldn\u2019t stand for it. Doing nothing is not ok.", "yeah. at this point she\u2019s letting her own grief overtake her relationship with her living daughter and actively overshadowing her living daughter\u2019s actual life. maybe her reasons are good, (i could see that being argued, but i don\u2019t really think so myself) but that doesn\u2019t change the effect she\u2019s having, and the selfishness inherent in it. nta.", "> what Layla would have wanted\n\nWhich is actually what the aunt would have wanted for Layla because she never lived long enough to want anything.", "She won't be able to get those pictures anymore after OPs cousin goes NC, and honestly, who could blame the poor kid after being treated second to an urn.", "What's worse is a dead baby is perfect, can never be flawed or grow up to disappoint the parent. But a living child can, so of course the living child is going to feel second place to what is essentially a fantasy sibling.", "Grief? Or narcissism? The dead child game gets attention all on mum, who gets love and cuddles and drama.", "And I do not fault OP for their phrasing. OP is young and the particulars of phrasing things one way vs another comes with life experience. OP was in protective mode over cousin and was frustrated and maybe even angry. Once the whole situation was clear, I just can\u2019t lay any blame for harsh phrasing.", "Ok, but from the post I'm guessing close in age to the cousin", "TV's turned on to snow despite being turned off at the wall and toys without batteries would turn on , you had to say \"hi D2\" to get things to stop to name a few", "Actually, she was ok. It was a \"minute silence\" for respect that's it  the rest of the day was entirely about D1 plus she loved her sister, she would play with her ghost everyday (well, atleast she said it was her ghost and I don't know how TV's turned on despite being turned off at the wall and toys without batteries would turn on to, you had to say \"hi D2\" to get things to stop).", "She did ask her if my cousin would do a speech about her sister or have a table with a memorial for her if she got married and my cousin shrugged and said possibly which is crazy to me", "Yeah sure but that's very different: you're still the wife in that scenario.", "I'm wondering how many other events the aunt has insisted the cousin share with the urn.  Will she demand the cousin carry the urn when the walks across the stage at high school graduation, or demand the carry the urn at cousin's wedding?", "I think it would be in the cousin's best interest to go NC, to be honest. It really sounds like she's playing second fiddle to her twin and the one day of the year that should be about her (her birthday) isn't. It reads like she's being treated as an accessory to an urn.", "This right here. And the aunt/mom can project all kinds of things (hopes/aspirations, etc.) on what they *believe* the dead child may have wanted to do with their life.  I feel bad for the living twin because it seems that her life took a backseat to a fantasy life lived by her dead twin.", "Auntie has broken everyone's will.", "All I can say is take your (living) cousin out after the birthday travesty and celebrate with her and friends. Do something she likes to do (beach? amusement park? spa? gaming?)", "Your poor cousin has been raised to believe her feelings and needs don\u2019t matter out of fear her mother might be upset.", "That's insane. I've been to a wedding where there was a small table with a picture of someone's sister who died as a teenager.  I thought that was very reasonable. They had lots of memories together.  \nIt seems like your aunt has broken the will of everyone around her.  I'm sure it is very difficult to lose a child like that. Someone should have stepped in long ago.", "at this point i wouldn\u2019t put it past her, unfortunately."]}
