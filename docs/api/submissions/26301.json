She was a twin and her sister unfortunately passed a few hours after birth. This is obviously very upsetting for all members of the family and a horrible situation to be handed. However me and my cousin are extremely close and every single birthday she has had has also been about her twin sister. Her mum will always put a little fancy background with her twins ashes and make my cousin take photos with it every birthday. She always posts \u201chappy birthday to my 2 beautiful girls\u201d up until my cousin was about 6 she was ok with this however since then she always expresses how she no longer feels like her birthdays are important anymore as it makes her mother upset due to the reminder and also because she feels everyone only talks about her twin and how they are so sorry for her loss. She doesn\u2019t feel like an individual person and constantly feels attached to her dead twin. \n\nLast night I asked her what she was doing for her birthday. She said her dad had wanted to take her to Spain but her mother said no because \u201cI don\u2019t think we can take the ashes overseas and it\u2019s too risky to bring Layla (the twin who passed) in case something happens\u201d this upset me a little as her 18th is a big birthday and she is being held back by her sister who A. Isn\u2019t alive and B. She doesn\u2019t even remember. I asked her if she\u2019s told her mum how upset she gets about her birthdays and how she doesn\u2019t feel like she can be an individual. She said she doesn\u2019t want to upset her mum so hasn\u2019t told her. Today at a family gathering my aunt was talking about how excited she is for the photographer to take pictures of my cousin and Laylas urn. I pulled her to one side and said we all understand how she feels but that she needs to get over and accept that Layla is gone and focus on her living daughter. She was extremely offended even after I told her how my cousin feels. She has uninvited me from my cousins birthday. AITA for this?\n\nUPDATE: after reading some comments I\u2019ve messaged my cousins dad who has agreed us 3 will be going to Spain to celebrate my cousins 18th. My aunt is definitely not happy with this as it\u2019s \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to Layla and to everyone else who has made plans to see my cousin but the flights and hotel are now booked and my cousin is feeling a lot better about her 18th", "created_utc": 1693995434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bgf2d/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_to_get_over_her/", "score": 2577, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your uncle and cousin have to confront your aunt. They are the ones who are enabling her by allowing this to happen.

It is just never going to be helpful or effective to tell somebody to \"get over\" their child's death. It would have been much better for you to simply say you think that your cousin should be able to go on the trip, without it being hampered by the death of her sister, and that it has got to be tough to live all ones birthdays under the shadow of the sibling who didn't survive. The aunt wouldn't like it, but it's much more for her to chew on, and less outright offensive than telling somebody to 'get over' their daughters death!!!

You can show support to your cousin and encourage her to work through HER issues with HER mother. Grief is a big deal and absolutely not something that everyone processes even remotely the same. Your aunt is dealing with trying to celebrate your cousin and celebrate the life of her deceased sister. Being happy for one child on the same day you lost another is extremely complicated emotionally. It\u2019s no one\u2019s place to tell her how to grieve or honor unless the intended recipient has an issue, as in this case, at which point it is between the two of them to talk through their feelings and evolve to a better place together or to establish clear boundaries now that they are both adults.", "YTA.

It sounds like everyone has been afraid to do anything because up until now she's had the power to cut out anyone who says it.  If she's paying for the festivities she holds invitation power.  What does your cousin say?  Does she want the big to-do, or would she rather hang with you and some other relatives and friend?

There\u2019s no \u201cgetting over\u201d that. But there is learning how to live with it. And part of learning how to live with it is making sure your surviving children get the life they deserve. Do I acknowledge my angel babies on their birthdays? Absolutely. It\u2019s not dramatic but every year I find myself wondering who\u2019d they be now and allow myself some time to be sad and wistful in private, or just with my partner (not their father), who gives me space to talk. Are my surviving children aware of their brothers who never had a chance at life? Yes, of course. But it\u2019s not such a defining part of their life that their own lives are overshadowed and limited by that. They never knew their brothers and it would be weird and creepy to try to force a relationship with ghosts purely for my benefit. At most they need to be aware because my pregnancy issues likely have a genetic component (my mother and her mother had similar complications), and they deserve to know should those issues be passed on to any daughters they might have. \n\nAunt needs therapy.

The mom could have had her own birthday memorial in her bedroom or something.", "NTA - I'm glad OP was able to help her cousin see how she IS celebrated for herself.  It seems really unhealthy to force a daughter to go through such a sickening ceremony after 18 years with that urn.", "Definitely NTA. The Aunt is taking this a bit too far and I agree with other responses... she needs therapy to deal with the loss of her daughter which she hasn't fully come to terms with it sounds like. I feel really bad for the Aunt, but she is destroying her daughter's life and ruining her birthdays, now a fun trip too. I feel the daughter might become resentful and I wouldn't blame her.", "NTA. Your aunt needs help, this isn't normal. It's way more traumatic for your aunt who birthed the children and then had one die than it is for your cousin who had no understanding of what happened at the time and who's memories of it are shaped by your aunt.\n\nEven the birthday thing is super creepy. I would try to put an end to it all and encourage your cousin to withdraw from participating in anything involving the dead siblings ashes. \n\nHopefully your aunt can be encouraged to seek therapy because she needed it 18 years ago.", "NTA. I feel for your poor cousin and her family. Obviously it's tough for parents to lose a child. They might never get fully over that. \n\nBut your aunt has been functionally sacrificing her living daughter in order to cope with her loss. Your cousin is living in the shadow of the perfect babygirl. The one that never grew up to be a tiring child, to gain interests that her mom wouldn't like, or one that would get into a fight with her parent. No living person can compete with that.\n\nNormally you should really stay out of people's grieving process, except to offer support. But after 18 years, the family (aunt) should've found a better way to cope with the loss. It was long overdue that somebody would tell your aunt to cut it out. She probably needs some extensive therapy and she needs to get to that quick if she wants a future relationship with her living daughter. The damage this does to your cousin's development as an individual might be substantial.\n\nAlso quick shoutout to the uncle, who apparently doesn't join in the weirdness, but stands by and lets it happen anyway. He hasn't protected his daughter from this either and left it in your hands.\n\nYou are a good friend for sticking up for your cousin.", "ESH\n\nYou- you told her to get over her dead daughter. That\u2019s not really a thing. There\u2019s always a loss there and untimely deaths don\u2019t really hit the same as timely deaths that \u201cdissipate\u201d? at some point. Like I don\u2019t ever sit around like what would my grandma be like at 90. I do think what would my daughter be like at 2. \n\nHer- She does need to focus on her alive daughter. She can ALSO focus on her daughter that passed. She can do a ceremony (by herself) every year if she wants to. She can kiss the urn goodnight every day if she feels the need. She still has obligations to her daughter that lived. Her daughter is not a living memorial. She is a whole person and she\u2019s not being treated that way. I\u2019m in some support groups for parents of \u201ctwinless twins.\u201d In some cases the surviving child does have their own loss- when the other child died later on and they had a relationship to them prior to their passing. In most cases though the twin doesn\u2019t really have a loss, and many parents try to push one on them anyway. I find this grossly unhealthy.", "NTA. Maybe your cousin should start posing with a dead baby model instead.", "I got nothing for my 18th birthday.  So what?", "NTA but perhaps she is NTA too. She has severe behavioural issues caused by not completing her grief journey. I have helped people in this situation and it can be VERY hard to get over the loss of a child, years, even decades, and keeping ashes is a very common symptom. That is not to say you should not have strict and reasonable boundaries and not put up with shit, but perhaps consider, after the anger of being bugged by this unreasonable behaviour, she needs empathy not anger. She needs help and she needs those around her to guide her to that help. This in itself can be a long journey, but with the right help she can at least start the journey. That being said, if she refuses help or makes the journey a battle, you need to consider how you relate to her.\n\nAlso, your cousin is turning 18 and this is an opportunity to break free from her stifling behaviour and live her own life. She needs a lot of help here to ensure boundaries with her mother are ensured.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. Your aunt is gonna find herself with 0 daughters if she keeps minimizing her actual living child as your cousin will probably move away as fast as possible. If a parent continually acts like one child is more important than the other, the other will take themselves out of the situation. I would know as I have barely any contact with my mom because she chose my little sister\u2019s needs over mine. \nAnd it sounds as thought the aunt also is making the cousin\u2019s birthday all about herself, playing the victim card for sympathy.", "NTA, people mourn and grieve, that's fine, but the point of it is that you get on with it eventually, people die, but you have to get on with life afterwards. It sounds like she needs serious therapy and think about what she has now, what she can do instead of dwelling on the past.", "NAH or NTA, depending on whether your aunt can't *afford* therapy (> NAH) or *refuses* to see a therapist (> NTA).\n\nAuntie is most definitely a severe problem for her family (especially for her surviving daughter), and you aren't.

Maybe her mom should respect her wishes to just lay low rather than be put on a pedestal and forced to participate.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NAH - this is a shitty situation. You might have been a bit harsh on the delivery, but the truth hurts sometimes. Aunt is seemingly forgetting Cousin is her own person. She is allowed to mourn her child\u2019s passing as she sees fit, but she should remember that Cousin has been alive and well for 18 years and hasn\u2019t gotten to live outside her sister\u2019s shadow.", "NTA, if your aunts not careful she would have any daughters left, well none that will talk to her", "NTA.  \n\nHas your aunt gone for any kind of therapy?  Because making her daughter pose with an urn of ashes every year is just... wow.  I can understand briefly honoring her, but then make the day about that surviving child.  She needs to stop treating the urn like it is, in fact, her lost daughter.  This isn't healthy for anyone.", "Nta", "NTA. Everyone copes on their own way yes, but the aunt needs to go to therapy. As soon as her coping mechanism puts priority over people she is supposed to be taking care of, it\u2019s not a good thing. Also if it actively affects the happiness of others, that\u2019s a no no. \n\nEnjoy that Spain trip and hopefully your cousins actually gets to live a little instead of being consistently reminded of the death of someone she has no memory of.", "NTA.

No one should dictate how others deal with their grief, that being said, a person should never foster their personal grief on others. Life is for the living, and letting your grief overwhelm the lives and dreams of those that survived is not a healthy way of dealing with your sadness. It's fine to say a small something about the one lost on special days, it's not fine when you carry the ashes around with you and refuse your family vacations for fear of not carrying your personal lodestone on the trip. \n\nAunt needs to talk to a therapist, as does cousin they have both become trapped in a vortex of grief and suffering that have been circling for many years this has damaged poor cousins psyche and taught her she is of lesser importance than someone who is no longer there nor has she been in her memory.\n\nI hope they can work something out because poor cousin is going to suffer greatly in life from the self-esteem issues that this is causing her.", "[removed]", "The message needed to be said, OP is NTA for saying it.\n\nBut OP is probably the wrong person for being heard and taken seriously by the aunt.\n\nThe best bet is to go to the parent of OP who is the sibling of the aunt, and both OP and her cousin explain the problem, which the parent then addresses with their sister.  Or talk to one of their grandparents-in-common, for the same reason.  \n\nOP and their cousin are and will always be children in the aunt's eyes, to a certain extent.  The message will be taken more seriously coming from someone the aunt considers a peer or an authority figure. \n\nBoth the aunt and the cousin suffered a loss with the death of the twin.  But they are very different losses.  The aunt has a lived and vivid memory of a wanted child.  The cousin has the shadow of someone she never knew hovering over her life.  The aunt expects the cousin to feel the loss the way she does, but that's impossible.  And the cousin can't really process the situation when she's being forced into her mother's mold for what the experience should be.\n\nThe mother may never \"get over\" the loss, and grief will change over time, and be processed at its own pace. But the mother can learn the boundaries between herself and her living daughter, and respect those boundaries.\n\nIt is not unlike the issues when the parent of a minor child dies, and the surviving parent processes the loss at a different rate and in a different way than the child.", "The ashes and other daughter are a prop.
