My husband (35) and I were friends back then, but eventually made things work.\n\nFast forwards to 3 years ago. I had a best friends who everyone knew we were always together. Then we got the terrible news. My best friend was HIV positive, and due to complications he died extremely fast from AIDS. From the moment of his actual diagnosis to his day of death it was only 4 months. I was lucky enough that his parents sneaked me in to his hospital room to say goodbye, lying to the staff by saying I was his sister... he died 2 hours later. He died December 23rd. One of the last things he said to me was \"I am sorry for being the grinch and ruining everyone's Christmas\". I still cry to this day when I remember that conversation. Truth be told, I felt like I was never going to get better. \n\nUpon hearing of his death, my MIL decided to take my son for the night, which was perfect since the following day it was going to be Christmas Eve. I cried all night, showered, got dressed in all black, and headed to have lunch with my son and in laws before heading to BFFs parents house to help with funeral preparations. \n\nCue SIL. We hadn't told anyone cause of death because my BFF wasn't ready to tell people his diagnosis, and I understood. So my mother calls me to ask how I was feeling and I walk out to the driveway for privacy. SIL quickly follows and lurks around. As soon as I hang up from my mother she comes up... \n\n\"Sorry for your loss\" she says \"why did he die?\"\n\nI stare at her and lie. \"Pneumonia\"\n\n\"No he didn't\" she says, almost smirking, treating this as some juicy gossip. \"No one dies of pneumonia... he died of AIDS right? You can tell me.\"\n\nI saw red. I told her so many things, such as \"his body isnt even cold yet and here you are treating this as effing TMZ\" and a couple other choice words. She became offended and went to tell my husband on me, to which my husband screamed at her \"I told you not to say anything!\" I was enraged. At the end of the show, she left... and to this day hasnt apologized yet. \n\nSo fastforward to now, she recently wanted to  give birth near where my husband and I live.. why? no clue. They are like besties. But I completely declined the opportunity of her coming into my home and they had to rent out an airbnb for one month... \n\nmy husband didnt fight it after i mentioned that she kicked me when i was at my lowest, and i just didnt wish to help her. That and she is petty at times towards me ever since I told her a thing or two that one day...  \n\nLong story, I know... but AITA for still being angry and not allowing her to even take a step inside my home?", "created_utc": 1688701806, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14svnfs/aita_for_making_my_sil_stay_at_an_airbnb_after/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t see the conflict here. She asked to stay with you, you said no and she and your husband are going to split the cost of the Airbnb. She\u2019s fine not having a relationship with you and you feel the same way about her. You\u2019re clearly still hurt by what happened but unless you\u2019re going to confront your SIL and demand an apology, there\u2019s no other reason to dwell on it. However I do want to ask if your husband ever apologized to you for violating your friend\u2019s privacy and breaking your trust? I\u2019m just asking because oftentimes in these situations, people focus their anger on the in-law, even though it was their spouse who created the problem.", "Nta.. your home YOUR safe space.. not SILs", "NTA. Grief grudges are totally a thing and grieving has no time limit. Plus, ew, her behavior was terrible. No apology? Just wow.", "NTA. i'm so sorry for your loss and how she poked fun at him for having aids. it's your home and you have the right to decide if someone stays over at your house or not. she made the decision of having her baby near your home instead of hers, she should have thought about where she was going to stay. i don't understand why she's not in her own home though.", "I must be missing something here. Why aren\u2019t you mad at your husband for telling her the true cause of death and asking her to keep it a secret from you?\n\nIt sounds to me like she hadn\u2019t expected you to lie about the cause of death, and her reaction was somewhat unfortunate but nowhere near as malicious as you perceived it to be.\n\nIf I\u2019m missing something, please clarify, but for now I\u2019m leaning YTA.", "nta, to have someone that is so hateful and mean in your home for a month playing at being queen of the castle; she would have made you wait on her hand and foot....they always do. this would be a big nope for me.", "NTA - You are definitely not the A-hole in this situation. Your sister-in-law's behavior was extremely disrespectful and insensitive.\n\nIt's understandable that you would not want someone with such disrespectful behavior to stay in your house, especially for an extended period of time.\n\nYou have every right to establish boundaries and prioritize your own emotional well-being. It's important to surround yourself with people who treat you and others with respect and kindness.

When someone hurts you they should apologize. She didn\u2019t. She\u2019s had years and still refuses.\n3. Family still has to follow these rules. Being related doesn\u2019t entitle someone to hurt others or ignore boundaries.\n4. SIL would be a horrible guest!", "NTA. You don't have to allow anyone in your home that you don't want, family or not. She showed you what kind of person she is and I don't blame you for not wanting her in your house.

I\u2019m still having trouble believing that your SIL really had ill intentions when she asked you about his death.

This clearly wasn\u2019t as big of a deal to her as it was to you.\n\nI definitely sense a lack of communication, and I think that\u2019s the true mistake here. You should talk to her, hopefully civilly, keeping your emotions in check. Let her know that what she said felt incredibly insensitive, and that you would like to hear an apology.\n\nShe\u2019s still friends with your husband so this isn\u2019t going to go away unless you take steps to try and resolve things.", "It\u2019s an asshole response because he DID die of pneumonia...
