Dude obviously can't swallow his pride.", "Nta. No one blames him for having a broken leg and not being able to participate, and putting all activity on hold until he can keep up will impact the kids very badly. The only thing that makes him look like a looser is not figuring out a way to be graceful about his current limitations\n\nAs someone who was made to flounder when my parents were ill and then as an adult who was poorly taken care of after an injury by someone I take very good care of\u2026 you\u2019re doing good work and it shouldn\u2019t be overlooked by him how much good you\u2019re doing for your family", "NTA, it's about the kid's needs, not his.\n\nI can give a little perspective here though, Nov of 2019 I was in a motorcycle accident and broke my ACL spine and damn near shattered my tibia. Strick bed rest for 4 months, while my wife had to work 9 hours then come home, take care of the dogs, cook dinner, clean the house, do laundry, and take a shower with me. My feelings of ineptitude and frustration were very real and very hard to cope with, but being the stubborn cuss I am, I devised ways to help where I could, mostly laundy and putting the dishes in the dishwasher away.\n\nThis is probably how your husband is feeling, but sounds like he's lashing out a bit instead of \"suffering in silence.\" It's  nobodies fault, but sometimes it's hard to compartmentalize the anger and frustration.", "NTA.\n\nIn your shoes, I would have responded to his remark with:\n\n\"That's a great idea!  We'll see if they want to do that when we get back from our bike ride!  We may have to buy some new puzzles in the next week too!\"", "NTA\n\nYour husband may still be processing what happened to him with the accident and maybe even be slightly depressed. Your kids are young and they aren\u2019t going to think \u201coh , after I ride my bike, I should play a game with dad\u201d\n\nYour husband is recovering and it takes time. It\u2019s good your are still able to do the things with the kids that were done before the accident. Routine is good for them.", "NTA - your husband is being unreasonable.\n\n'if i can't do it, no one else can because it makes me sad to not be included!'\n\nLet your husband sulk, perhaps he can spend his down time researching how to be an adult - INSTEAD of making nasty comments about the fact that you don't have a broken leg.", "Nta....their day to do activities shouldn't  change just because he can't do. They still neednto burn off that energy.", "NTA he has a broken leg he can\u2019t help that but he shouldn\u2019t be taking it out on you. \n\nYou can\u2019t give up on family activities just because he\u2019s bedridden.\n\nI remember when my dad was recovering for surgery, he had to stay in bed while we all went out. The only thing he said about it was that he finally had peace and quiet in the house.", "NTA.   Does your husband actually expect everyone to sit around the house for the next six weeks because his leg is in a cast?   There are these things called wheelchairs and crutches.  No reason he can't get outside as well to some degree.", "NTA. He is understandably bored or lonely but your kids' energy won't change with his physical restrictions. Its nasty to suggest that you are enjoying his infirmity.", "NTA - your kids did not break their legs, your husband did.  And if he thinks it's such a bad thing for them to be out getting exercise, just leave them with him at home all afternoon as they bounce off the walls and he'll probably beg you to take them out.  I understand your husband isn't happy about having restrictions on his activities while he heals, but this is childish.  I'm sure you are having to do quite a bit more to take care of things while he is laid up and he needs to stop making life harder.  Some people just make lousy patients and I'm just not even going to start on which gender; I've seen both ways.", "NTA, Sounds like your husband is getting cranky and lashing out a bit. If he's usually active like you and your children, he's probably frustrated at not being with you all when you're doing outdoor stuff, and, unfortunately, he's taking it out on you. \n\nHopefully, this will pass, but in the meantime, it isn't your issue. The kids need to be out about getting rid of energy, and you have to be there too.", "NAH\n\n> He rolled his eyes and said \"you're loving being supermom while I look like a lazy do-nothing.\"\n\nThis is a *wildly* over-the-top reaction to this utterly innocent situation.\n\nI hesitate to call your husband an asshole, as I get the very distinct sense he's struggling with some serious feelings of depression and inadequacy following his accident. He should probably see about therapy.", "Nta. Your husband has an injury & you haven't put your lives on hold boarded up access to the outside world?? He sounds like a petulant child demanding attention & to get his way. How attractive in a partner.", "NTA! It sounds like your husband may be feeling jealous or resentful, but it's not your fault. Does he have a transport chair or something so he can accompany you for walks? Or maybe he can throw the ball and let your kids practice hitting. They'll have to gather them and bring them back, but my friend and I have done this with our kids and they don't seem to mind rounding up all the balls. Stores sell small bags with plastic practice balls, they're made to not go crazy far. If you have a strong hitter they may, but at that age it's not likely.", "NTA The children's needs are the same and it is up to you to handle the physical activity until your husband is able to resume activity. It's really that simple. \n\nMy guess is he is mentally over being laid up and dependent on you, making him super cranky.  Sounds like he is taking his frustration out on you because, well, where else can he direct it? He probably knows deep down his words are crap. At least I hope he does.", "NTA. Kids lives shouldn't be put in hold", "NTA, your children shouldn't have to suffer.", "NTA", "NTA. But your husband really either. I think he feels sad and upset he can't do what he used to. Be mindful of depression setting in.", "NTA - kids that age have way too much energy and you have to do whatever it takes to get them to burn it. It's unreasonable to expect them to stop doing stuff just because your husband can't help out for a while.", "After a sports injury as a kid, I learned that there's no one grumpier than an active person who can't be active. Still find it true 30+ years later. Just like the kids, he's got too much energy and no way to burn enough off, and is feeling bored and left behind - not a great headspace. That does NOT give him the right to take his frustration out on you. You're right - activities are healthy for your kids, and they shouldn't be reined in because he (temporarily) can't keep up. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Is your husband on pain killers? His delusional self-pity reads like it's opiate induced.", "NTA and your man is just being a giant baby. Nothing else.

I mean, this is a broken leg....you\u2019d be looking at worse problems if his injury was going to have life long implications... \n\nPs. His broken leg might have long term implications because of his age and if he doesn\u2019t do PT.
