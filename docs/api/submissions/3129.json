Does she hate these cakes because they\u2019re not her preference? Like, they\u2019re tolerable, but they\u2019re a little dry, or she\u2019d rather have red velvet? Or are they actively disgusting? Because the solution for the former is to just say \u201cthanks for the cake,\u201d communicate that she\u2019d prefer something different next time, and enjoy her preferred cake at a birthday dinner scheduled for another day. If it\u2019s actually inedible? Possibly a different issue.

And if it\u2019s just general awkwardness, surely the solution is not to create a vastly more awkward situation for other people. A host and a house of guests for a birthday party, no birthday kid, and the other parent isn\u2019t answering his phone? It would be mortifying for everyone there.\n\nI definitely don\u2019t blame the kid for being frustrated with the situation, but it seems like OP responded in a way that was guaranteed to create major conflict.

It was a pain for them because I could not force her to go but they had to come and talk to her because of the custody agreement.  We were forced into family classes to work on it and given a big talk about how this works.
