The mother should have used words and conversed with the daughter about what she wanted to do or if she wanted to do anything at all. Mom did this for her own self satisfaction. Not her child's.", "Prearranged custody agreements is for if she was going to spend the night or living permanently, but you point stands. She's 15, she can go outside. She's not living with her dad, she's a teenager who went out because she wanted to and  she had not been asked to stay.\n\nAs I teen if I wanted to go out I just went to the door and left, I didn't ask if I could or say I was, I just went out.", "How isn't it? The whole plan is the lie to someone then force them into a situation they didn't ask for. Devious as fuck. Going around behind someone's back and arranging things with a bunch of people, keeping it all from someone for your own gratification is low. That's how they got Ceasar", "Good man, not throw anything your Ex says out of the window. You cannot please everyone and certainly you should not get out of your way to please your Ex and make you daughter miserable. Enjoy your time with her because at this age of her life she needs you as a strong role model.", "I agree that some communication should have been had.", "Can\u2019t imagine why he\u2019s an ex \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He took the child our of the house without letting the mom know and kept his phone on silent. Mom had no idea where her daughter was. You seriously think that's okay?", "This is basic common sense. Gina said that she hates the cakes which means she's had it on more than a few occasions. Despite what some people think,  not everyone is a a good baker and not all moms can cook.", "I have a hard time believing that the mother wouldn\u2019t notice the daughter didn\u2019t like her cake, after multiple years of doing it.\n\nShe\u2019s either extremely oblivious, or intentionally ignoring it.", "The street doesn't belong to her I can show up in the street anywhere you know?", "Do you know what if the mother was worried about it? She should\u2019ve told him what she was planning and he would\u2019ve known. Technically, he didn\u2019t know she didn\u2019t tell him. And planning a party you know your doesn\u2019t daughter doesn\u2019t like over and over again it\u2019s just wrong.", "How old are you? Seriously. You think you can go to your ex home uninvited and they will just nicely let you in?", "I get what your saying, but I don\u2019t think when you throw a party for someone it\u2019s necessarily done with malicious or selfish intent. I think that projecting a lot of negative ideals on a mom trying to celebrate her daughter. Yes I think at some point she should take a hint or the daughter should be direct and tell her (not just dad) she doesn\u2019t like these parties. Then maybe the mom can find a different way to celebrate her daughter. Perhaps she is just doing it the only way she knows how to. Loving people and appreciating people they way they want to be isn\u2019t always easy. Most people show love the way they were brought up or would like to be loved.", "> As I teen if I wanted to go out I just went to the door and left, I didn't ask if I could or say I was, I just went out.\n\nYour parents not having communication or rules for their teen is irrelevant. That clearly is not acceptable to this mom and that is not the arrangement or standard this group has set up.\n\nPrearranged custody is not just for staying the night. They have an agreement and he knowingly violated it. He knew he was wrong which is why he has his phone on silent and didn\u2019t communicate with her mom. That makes him a problematic co-parent and the asshole.", "I still see it as a party to show love \ud83d\ude02 but upvote because Brutus was such an AH", "Lol have you not met a 15 yr old before? You realize she LEFT the house WITHOUT telling her mom she was leaving?? And the OP just happened to have his ringer turned off? Give me a break, the OP is a huge AH.", "Or op dislikes his ex and can tell the story in whichever way he wants since we can\u2019t ask her questions.", "I mean my grandma made this fruit salad for years. Even when I went off to college I\u2019d come home and she make me fruit salad. It was something she made just for me. Maybe I liked it when I was little. I don\u2019t remember ever liking it. I can promise you I never told her or anybody else for that matter. Grandma made the fruity salad. It had jellos, whip cream, canned fruits, pecans and coconut flakes. Ugh I hated it. She made it until she wasn\u2019t in health to make it anymore and I never told her.", "What a stalker-y thing to say, yikes", "How old are you? Seriously?

I'll stop the hate though. Brutus was an AH xD", "Obviously,  I've meet a 15 year old. And don't tell anyone but I've been one before \ud83d\ude44 and it definitely wasn't that long ago.

In my ex home when we don't even get along?", "Would definitely be the better and more mature idea than taking your daughter out of there without giving your ex a notice. You knew about it, so you can ask about it. And if she would've said no, you could still bring up what you did in the end but WITH informing her.", "You came and took your daughter away knowing that her mother was throwing her a party. I can't imagine why you don't get along."]}
