Occasionally my mom will have her \u201cboyfriend,\u201d let's call him Timmy (79M), stay over, and every time he does, he asks for my food \u201cas a joke.\u201d \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what it is, candy, chips, a meal, he\u2019s asking if he can have some, and I say \u201cno\u201d each and every time.\n\nToday my mom made me pancakes, and it\u2019s my second \u201cmeal\u201d in the last week or two. A little context, I don\u2019t get to eat real food very often and ration what little I do have. Once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone, so I\u2019m very careful with how I eat. I eat very little, so I\u2019m damn near starving and always ready to eat whatever places anything places in front of me, especially if it\u2019s more than a bag of chips or some candy.\n\nNow back to the pancake situation. So my mom finished making two pancakes for me and not even 30 seconds after I leave the kitchen he\u2019s asking if he can have some. I\u2019m hungry, like I said I only had one meal prior to this and it was 11-12 hours. So of course I tell him no.\n\nThe moment the word leaves my mouth I\u2019m being called selfish and rude because \u201cthat\u2019s not right, you don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s just a joke\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a joke I\u2019m hungry and I\u2019m sick of being asked to share. I\u2019m just expected to say yes because it\u2019s a \u201cjoke\u201d? What if I say and it\u2019s not a joke, am I just expected to give up my food because I said I would?\n\nMy mom\u2019s response? \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case you can go get more\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s more in the kitchen why am I expected to give up food when he can just go and get his own? \n\nBoth of them tried to guilt saying it\u2019s selfish to not share and he\u2019s hungry too. And I will admit I got a little snippy when defending myself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong but I get this reaction every time. AITA?\n\nETA: there\u2019s no abuse going on in the household. I ration because money is tight and I have safe foods so once I eat those up I\u2019ll have nothing to eat. I don\u2019t like to be burden and ask for more food because I *know* money is tight.
