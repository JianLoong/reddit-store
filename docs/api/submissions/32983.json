A bit of backstory, my sister and I are very close, last month my wife (34F) and I hosted a birthday party for her at our house. One of her friends wore heels worn down to the metal nail, denting our floor. My sister noticed an hour into the party and told her friend but the friend was unwilling to take them off and only did so reluctactantly after prodding. I told my sister to worry about it later, but after the party we saw the entire living room was covered in deep dents. However thanks to my sister getting her friend to take her heels off we avoided too much damage in the kitchen and hallway.\n\nThere was a lot of drama within my sister's friend group afterward. Turns out the friend knew her heels would leave dents but wore them anyways and she didn't care at all about the floor damage she caused. My sister tried to get her to pay the repair bill, but the friend smirked, said that she was just making our floors look \u201clived in\u201d and my sister should be the one paying for rudely making her take off shoes that made her outfit. My sister was livid and ended the friendship immediately. She felt terrible, blamed herself for inviting that friend, and said she would pay for repairs. My wife and I said no as it wasn't her fault and she also prevented any more damage from occurring by noticing before anyone else had, and we comforted her and don't blame her.\n\nMy wife, sister, and I are holding a Christmas party, and my wife and I decided to ban heels. My sister asked us to let her still wear stilettos, as she makes sure they are in good condition and not damaging (which is true, she lived with us for 2 years before moving out, visits often, and never left a single dent even though she always wears heels the entire time), but we feel having my sister wear heels while having a heel ban for guests would be bad. My sister isn't inviting the former friend who wrecked the floors or anyone remotely supportive of her actions, but we feel the potential for damage is too great still if someone unintentionally wears worn out heels. My sister is very upset by this as she hates wearing anything but stilettos, and this is a party where everyone will dress up.\n\nShe suggested telling guests to check their heel tips weren't missing, and that she would inspect their shoes to make sure they wouldn't cause damage, but we feel that this is too tacky. She also said she would pay for fixing the floor should damage occur, again offered to pay the previous repair bill, but we don't want this as my sister earns less than we do and the repair would be very costly for her, plus repairs are inconvenient. My sister has been begging us to let her wear heels to the party, and tearfully asked if we wanted to punish her for the damage from her birthday party, but that isn't the case at all. However, I understand how much this hurts her, and I wonder if we should let her wear the shoes she wants or just remove the high heel ban.

But those stiletto heel stoppers - could be a compromise. While meant for grass, some people actually use them regularly to prevent wear and tear, even indoors.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not siding with your sister. Just putting something out there that you may want to consider if you feel that badly. She might not want to use them though.", "Wouldn't it be easier to just have all guests take their shoes off when they enter the home?  It's not a standard practice in the US, but not totally unheard of either. I think banning a specific shoe might be leaning into AH territory especially since sis is willing to bend over backwards to make sure everything goes well including offering to pay for repairs. I mean, someone could have a pointy rock lodged in their sneakers that could cause comparable damage. On the other hand, I agree with you that having her inspect everyone's shoes would be tacky. \n\n\nThat said, no one should be crying over shoes. But, if the only dress shoes she owns are heels you are essentially making her buy new shoes for the party that she may never wear again. And you may be forcing other people to do the same. \n\n\nI think NTA for wanting to protect your floors, but you may want to look into other compromises. Buy rugs? Buy little slippers so people can take their shoes off and everyone has the same goofy (but comfy) footwear? Have people bring their own comfy footwear but take some photos of everyone in the front room or something with their nice shoes on so you have evidence of how nice everyone looked prior to fully entering? There might be options.", "Plot twist: Allow all types of footwear, then ask everyone to leave their shoes at the door and provide little booties!  Many cultures do not allow outdoor shoes inside.", "This feels like a bit of an overreaction. You aren\u2019t obligated to take away the no heels rule, but making the rule because one person messed up your floors once, after years of guests being responsible with their shoes, seems a little much. Like if you are worried that checking peoples shoes seems tacky, having a stiletto rule in the first place can come across as tacky anyway.", "Or be like Canada where shoes are not worn past the front door.", "Don\u2019t wear shoes in the house.\nThis would not be an issue in my country because we don\u2019t wear outside shoes indoors", "Honestly I'm kinda curious how the party plays out. \n\nBecause ita not just stilettos that use nails in the heal. Boots, men's dress shoes, kitten heals.... any decent shoe. \n\nUnless you are going to have ALL guests wear ballet slippers.... yeah you are unfairly targeting women, and your sister. \n\nOver a floor. \n\nA floor that gets walked on. \n\nEither have all guests remove their shoes, or deal with the fact that floors get walked on and damaged. That's what they are there for. \n\nOr don't have guests.", "YTA. How do you not think it\u2019s tacky to tell people - women only - what shoes they can and can\u2019t wear? Others have commented that any shoe can leave scratches and dents, including mens shoes. There have been alternatives suggested which you think are all tacky. \n\nIt you don\u2019t want damage to your floors then either don\u2019t have parties at your home or have everyone take their shoes off.", "Soft YTA. It's understandable why you'd want to ban heels, but what that person did was really quite remarkably unusual. They were, practically speaking, wearing broken shoes.\n\nI'm kind of unsure why you wouldn't just ask your guests to make sure their shoes aren't busted like that beforehand. In theory, after all, that damage could be caused by anyone with a similarly worn-down shoe -- not just a pair of heels, but a pair of dress shoes, leather boots, and so on. Anything that uses nails to secure the sole in some fashion. You've said you think that would be tacky? It... wouldn't be. It's a pretty reasonable request and your guests should be understanding.\n\nBut, like I said, it is understandable to be gun-shy on heels. But when you know shoes are an important part of one of your guest's self-expression, it's kind of AH-y to not do the thing that would make it all work just because you think it would be tacky.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry that your floors got messed up, but your sister\u2019s friend was wildly irresponsible and a total AH. Heels don\u2019t cause floor damage normally, so banning one type of footwear is weird. It\u2019s also really unlikely that someone wouldn\u2019t notice their heel tips are worn down - walking on the nail feels very different, it\u2019s obvious to the wearer that the shoe needs repair. If the people you invite over are not wildly irresponsible jerks and don\u2019t wear shoes that are falling apart your floors are safe. \n\nYou can either have everyone take their shoes off at the and provide slippers for people to wear (this is very normal in a lot of social circles), or you can allow people to wear shoes. Singling out guests is bad hosting.", "YTA - This is completely bizarre. I'm not a big fan of punishing the whole class because of one person. Some asshole wears broken shows to your house so you implement a heel ban? That's stupid. No one but her wears shoes like that and normal people would be horrified at the damage. She is a bad person. Just don't invite her. FYI most shoes have small nails of some sort than can become exposed so maybe just become a shoes-off household if you want to be this anal about it.", "One possible layer to this is that if you always wear high heels, the tendons in your legs can get shortened because they\u2019re used to keeping your ankles in that angle making it a painful stretch to walk in flats, similar to what you\u2019d otherwise feel standing on a sharp incline. If you stopped wearing heels you\u2019d eventually stretch them out again but it would take more than an evening and would be somewhat painful. If sister only has stilettos or if the stiletto ban covers any high heel, it\u2019s possible the night would be mildly torturous for her. Not saying that\u2019s definitely why she\u2019s so persistent in finding a compromise but it might be a contributing factor", "Your house, your rules but it feels kind of childish on your part. What are the chances of this actually happening again? What are the chances of you not noticing? Either treat your guests like adults or don't host.", "NTA \nJust ask all guests to remove their shoes regardless of shoe type. It's would be weird if half the women had no shoes and all the men and children were in shoes.\n\nSome people might feel uncomfortable, but this shouldn't hurt anyone's feelings.", "YTA. You can't dictate the shoes your guests wear. Have a shoes-off policy or put down mats and rugs.", "Have everyone take their shoes off, it\u2019s a simple fix.. I live in the us and shoes are not allowed off my door rugs.. nothing wrong with that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You\u2019re not necessarily TA, but a heels ban in the house is very weird. The heel dent seems like a rare and very specific occurrence.", "NTA\n\n> my wife and I decided to ban heels.\n\nNGL, I think this is a *tad* unreasonable.\n\n> we feel the potential for damage is too great still if someone unintentionally wears worn out heels.\n\nI don't think this is the risk you think it is? Good people wouldn't behave like that. You had **one** bad incident with someone who **intentionally** fucked your shit up.\n\n> She suggested telling guests to check their heel tips weren't missing, and that she would inspect their shoes to make sure they wouldn't cause damage, but we feel that this is too tacky\n\nI mean: dictating acceptable footwear in the first place is *pretty tacky*, too.\n\nBut in the end: Your house.

Keep your house closed to all outsiders.", "I love how everyone is saying ways op can compromise or to spend money on slippers for everyone yet the sister can\u2019t go one day without a shoe for a valid reason. There\u2019s different types of shoes she must have or can buy a cheap pair. \n\nWearing non stilettos for one day won\u2019t kill her. I honestly wouldn\u2019t even argue w the host.

Your sister might not have mentioned it directly, but it's possible she's actually in physical pain/discomfort walking around without heels for prolonged periods of time. You might want to ask if she experiences this and reconsider things if she does.\n\nAlso, it's not any more tacky than banning heels to ask that people make sure their shoes won't do damage before they come, explaining that previously someone's shoes did a lot of damage to your floor.

When you walk in stillettos, there's a point in your stride where your entire body weight is concentrated on roughly one square centimeter. This means that the pad covering the nail wears out quickly (it can be easy not to notice right away depending on what surfaces youve been walking on), and that once the nail is exposed, the only thing stopping it from sinking the full amount into whatever you're surface you're standing on is the resistance provided by the surface itself. While other shoes may also have nails, they have more than one, and unless we're talking hobnailed boots (which isn't a thing on dress shoes except for military parade boots), the nails don't protrude very far out of the rest of the sole so the depth to which they can damage the floor is minimal.\n\n2) Scratches and dents are two different things when it comes to wood flooring. Your ability to refinish wood flooring is limited based on the depth of the damage. Brand new hardwood flooring is typically 3/4 inch thick maximum, but can come as thin as 5/16 inch. Older flooring will tend to be thinner. I grew up in a house with oak flooring, which is pretty far up there in flooring hardness. I once accidentally put a quarter inch dent in it with stillettos that *still had the rubber cap on the nail*. I can't imagine how bad the damage was from shoes with an exposed nail. You can leave scratches for a while before refinishing, but you need to deal with deeper dents quickly, or something might catch and make the damage worse. *At minimum*, sister's ex friend halved the lifespan of the floor, but unless OP is lucky, they'll need to replace it.", "By worn down tips I mean heels where the rubber tip is gone and the metal nail sticks out.", "I'm replying to the statement that \"dictating acceptable footwear in the first place is pretty tacky\", with an extremely obvious example of dictating acceptable footwear.\n\nOutside shoes are not acceptable footwear inside many many homes.", "She's not crying about flats, but because she still feels bad anput the birthday party damage and this situation made her think we blamed her for it.", "I think you're way too harsh on my sister.

You can have pumps with multiple heel types and heights. \n\nThe weight is forced onto the ball of your foot in stillettos when you're standing, but when you step forward, you land on the heel. When you move to transfer your weight, there's a moment when all of your weight is concentrated on just the one heel.\n\nPolyurethane floor coatings aren't actually hard. They're thin and flexible, and they don't impact the hardness of the wood itself. If you've ever felt synthetic (PU) leather, it's the exact same material, just textured and on fabric instead of wood. The flexibility helps prevent minor dents and scratches, but if you exert enough force to damage the wood fibers under the coating, it'll dent. The dented area will be protected by the polyurethane, but it'll still be dented.\n\nLet's do the math. Wood hardness is rated on the Janka scale based on the amount of force it takes to sink a 11.28mm diameter steel ball half-way into a sample. When calculating the force exerted by walking, I'm just going to use static force instead for simplicity, but the actual force would be higher. I'm going to use the average weight of an adult woman in Canada (155lbs) since based on Reddit user statistics, OP is most likely from the US, but US adults skew heavier so Canada seems like a good way to split the difference. A 120lb person exerts 17,171N static force. When calculating the force exerted by a sphere, you use the final deformed area, which in this case would be about 4cm2. Bamboo is the hardest wood commonly used in homes based on the Janka scale. Its rating in Newtons is 13,000, meaning it deforms about a quarter inch with a steel item (like an uncapped stiletto nail) exerting a force of 3250N per square centimeter. This means a 120lb person walking in stilettos will exert more than five times more force than needed to deform the floor.", "The friend's heels were very worn and a lot of metal was poking out.
