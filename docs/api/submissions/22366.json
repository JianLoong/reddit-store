You\u2019re NTA. However, I wouldn\u2019t waste time confronting them\u2014it\u2019s not a good use of your time or your energy.

Unless the lady is a professional and has the credentials to back that up, she has no say to label anyone as \u201cmanspaining\u201d for having too much knowledge than herself.", "Here's a good litmus test: Would your response be any different if the comments came from a male? If not, it's probably not mansplaining.", "NTA Do not try to reason with morons who think the Earth actually could be flat or defends it.  Just write everything that comes out of their mouths off at that point.", "NTA. But know that this is an unwinnable argument. If you attempted to communicate in any fashion, there'll be reason to claim mansplaining. To be clear, I'm not saying that every time you say something someone will accuse you.  I'm saying that you were a male who explained something. \nThe issue is, were you at all overbearing? Unfortunately, that's not an objective measure. In fact, much of communication is subjective in how it's received & interpreted. \nBottom line is, (1) it's good to look at what you did to see if you acted ok & an outside opinion is extremely helpful in that, (2) if you conclude you were OK and your feedback isn't contradictory then just move on because (3) life is too short to spend it with people who don't understand/appreciate you.", "NTA, answering a question in a debate is not mansplaining, hers was a  lazy response. \n\nBut I am really interested in your subject matter OP. I have always wondered why people believe the theory of a flat earth, can you enlighten me?", "NTA however, I'm not sure why you would continue to engage with them.", "NTA, people always call you asshole if you prove them wrong", "As a woman, I know mansplaining exists.

I like the snek.", "Good point thank you for that advice", "Their understanding is on par with their understanding of geography (and their intelligence).", "I completely agree with this but I do want to say that checking with his girlfriend who is absolutely biased, isn't great back up lmao If OP is accused of stuff like this he needs an unbiased opinion not from someone that is supposed to back him up. Flat earthers are dumb though and seriously have to ignore things they can see with their own eyes to actually believe the earth is flat.", "The explanation they gave me was that by telling them things they already knew I was mansplaining", "It does these were in small groups and more practice than anything we sent in the slideshows for an actual grade and these were just practice", "No, not just sexist AHs, nice try. But OP didn't mansplain.", "I too have given the Snek. Long live the Snek!", "But they seemed to have asked you for it?", "My first professional job out of college was as a professional geographer. I dealt with a ton of flat earthers, and I\u2019ve heard their theories that they say make so much sense but don\u2019t. You weren\u2019t mansplaining, so NTA. \n\nBut I do think you should have spoken to your teacher instead. This could have been a learning moment for EVERYONE in class about how just because people say words against an idea, those words need to be weighted for validity.", "And more Snek.", "They technically didn\u2019t ask but one of my points was how flat earthers use points like how it was a widely accepted theory and I said that was false in my presentation but they begged to differ so they didn\u2019t ask for it but they were saying false info trying to one up me", "NTA though it may have been kind to acknowledge that she made a point because yes, conspiracy theories are designed to be un-disproveable. That is literally the nature of a conspiracy theory and is obviously a logical fallacy: requiring disproof rather than proof to believe any wild claim. But then, that would be mansplaining for sure. \n\nI\u2019m a woman who encounters and dislikes mansplaining but this doesn\u2019t sound like it. I also deal with a conspiracy theorist in my life and I know they can be defensive about their wacko beliefs. People can feel condescended to when you call them out for spouting bullshit.", "NTA, Definitely not mansplaining, but why on earth did you engage with flat-earthers? Do you not value your own safety and sanity?", "NTA   The girls just wanted to argue.  You're good.", "NTA  you were responding in a discussion about your presentation.\n\nThere are a lot more contentious names than mansplaining that you could use on people with irrational beliefs.", "That woman's just being salty because you had a mini-debate and she lost.\n\n(Hey, was I just mans-plaining?  I'm not good at planing.... because I'm not a woodworker.)", "The old greeks were able to prove that the earth is round, they calculated earth diameter almost perfectly. \n\nI'm not sure how anyone can defend flat earth theory, if all you have to do is watch the ocean for a ship to come. \nIn the aera of sailing, the first thing the look-out would see, was the tip of the sails with the flag for nationality. \nToday we would see the highest chimney or the radio antennas.", "Okay, you win\nThat's the BEST COMMENT I have ever seen on reddit", "Bill Burr, look out, the next king of comedy is on his way to replace you! ;-)", "You keep on using this word. I do not think it means what you think it means.", "I used to question how people were idiotic enough to let their government push them into a dark age.", "It\u2019s pretty sexist of them to imply women are incapable of being Captain Obvious. You cannot expect to reason logically with this group. I\u2019m so sorry you have to grow up around this nonsense."]}
