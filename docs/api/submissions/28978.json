Months ago, I started noticing dog poop on the sidewalk. New bits appeared almost daily. It looked like a dog was going to the bathroom as it was walking, leaving pieces strewn across 50ft+ sections. \n\nThis sidewalk is heavily trafficked, with people going to and from school/work, and people were clearly stepping on it. Nobody picked it up, and the only way it was being cleared was through rain, wind, or the bottom of someone\u2019s shoe. I have my own dog and walk it several times per day. I can\u2019t fathom doing this. The two obvious questions were:\n\n1. How could someone let their dog go right on the sidewalk and not pick it up?\n\n2. How has this person avoided being \u201ccaught in the act\u201d and asked to stop? \n\nFast forward a few months. I noticed a blind (I assume) lady walking her dog along this sidewalk. The dog leads her, stops her at intersections until completely clear, etc. \n\nI thought - clearly, this must be the culprit. She must not see or notice that the dog is doing it, and others don\u2019t feel right telling her when they see it happening. So, we get dog poop on the sidewalk every time she walks with her dog. \n\nSure enough, I saw it happen a few days ago, and no one around said or did anything. If I were in her position, I\u2019d want to know so that I could fix it. I\u2019d hate knowing my dog was doing this. Plus, I wouldn\u2019t want her stepping in it. \n\nWIBTA if, next time I saw her, I brought it up and asked her to pick it up or find a different solution?\n\nETA: My partner found out she is indeed blind, months before we discovered this dog was the source. I didn\u2019t know this, but the lady told her when my partner was out walking our dog. My partner just told me this. \n\nETA 2: The goal isn\u2019t to frame this lady as the AH. I don\u2019t want to shame or embarrass her. But, am I doing her a favor by picking after her dog for her, or for treating her like the responsible dog owner I\u2019m sure she is and letting her know this is happening?", "created_utc": 1697384086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178hxxc/wibta_if_i_asked_a_blind_person_to_pick_up_after/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she knows how to & the dog knows how to direct her to do so. \n\nIt is common for guide dogs for visually impaired to be trained to stand in position and alert their handler that they have finished, the handler then uses the dogs position (by feeling down the back leg) to locate the area to be cleaned up, and then the dog can even be trained to take the handler to the nearest garbage can so they can dispose of it\u2026 but if this dog is trained to do so and the handler knows what to do, we do not know. \n_____\nI would suggest, while this actually is happening and you see it, to gently approach the handler and just mention something like: \u201cyour dog appears to be trying to go to the bathroom\u201d\u2026 hopefully she then will take the dog for it\u2019s much needed break. \n\nIf she seems genuinely concerned about it and didn\u2019t seem to realize\u2026 you could then mention that you noticed it do this here before or something similar. \n\nHopefully she will get the hint to add in more breaks about that time of day or something for her dogs sake.", "NTA but it depends how you approach the situation.", "NTA\n\nDog care, including for service dogs, has to include some plan for their own wellness and maintenance.

Obviously this woman has fallen off of her routine with having her dog relieve itself properly and I\u2019m sure she would actually appreciate someone bringing it to her attention.
