{"id": 30330, "submission_id": "17noeyi", "title": "AITA for telling my MIL she needs to learn to let things go?", "selftext": "I (28f) have been married to my husband for 2 years now. His mom is a sweet enough woman but she drives me crazy trying to involve me in things that I have told her time and time again that I do not want to be involved in. The primary thing is trying to get me to convince my husband to make an effort to have a relationship with his (half) brother. My husband is 18 months older than his half brother but per my husband they never had a close relationship and never claimed each other as their sibling. When we started dating he told me he technically has a half brother but they do not speak and will never be close and he only tells those he wants in his life about him, otherwise he says he's an only child. Other family have confirmed his half brother does the same thing.\n\nMy MIL hates how things are between them. They do not have contact with each other. They're not social media friends, never had each other's number, never had any contact info. He wasn't invited to our wedding either. The only sure day they will see each other is when MIL is celebrating her birthday and they both show up for her. Christmas isn't an every year seeing each other thing. And even when they are in the same place for a wedding or whatever, they do not talk unless they have to.\n\nMIL has told me a lot in the last year especially how much it hurts her, how she fears that once she's gone they won't ever say a word to each other, etc. She told me I could convince my husband to try in ways she couldn't. I pointed out to her that a one-sided effort would be pretty meaningless and it's not just my husband who is disinterested. She begged me anyway and said she is desperate and would give her kidney for them to have a better relationship.\n\nI told my husband about it and he told her to stop. He told her to let it go and she said she can't.\n\nMy husband's birthday is Wednesday and his mom called me last Wednesday and asked if we could maybe invite her other son so we can see if things can be patched up. I told her my husband would hate that so no. She told me I could convince him not to hate it. She told me how badly she needs me and everything. I told her she needs to learn to let things go and she's driving me crazy by trying to put me in the middle when I am on my husband's side, always. I told her she will drive them away from her if she doesn't learn.\n\nMIL for the first time ever snapped at me. She told me I would be more sympathetic if I had kids already but I can't understand her pain. She told me she desperately wanted me to understand. She then ended the call and told me she has no words right now for me. I have felt bad since because she sounded so defeated and so heartbroken and I never wanted to do that to her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699112731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17noeyi/aita_for_telling_my_mil_she_needs_to_learn_to_let/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The truth is I cannot understand what it's like to be in her position and I feel like I went in the wrong direction to dealing with this. I feel like I should have given her a shoulder to lean on and maybe spoke to her calmly and gently about letting go instead of blurting out that she needs to learn. It just feels overall more harsh than she deserves maybe.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I were you I would go very low contact and stop taking her calls because she's willing to drive you and your husband apart so that she gets her way. You absolutely do not want to be in the middle of this.

As you say, it is unfair to try to put you in between.", "NTA You did exactly as you should've. You should be on your husband's side. Make sure you tell your husband of this latest conversation.

The sons can try to put a little effort to appease their mom just a little, but I guess its just me.", "The fact that they did not grow up together tells me that one must have grown up with their dad and not the mom they had in common.", "They do, they both meet up with her for her birthday."]}
