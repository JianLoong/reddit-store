It's no joke that united front.  Because I can see where you are correct in the loss of trust and her mother's concern for the monthly cramps issue.  So Dr. appt for the monthly's to be sure there is no underlying health issue and open discussion on how to treat that pain with all 3 of you.  And another ongoing conversation between you and your wife about allowing your daughter to do an end run around either of you whenever she doesn't like the answer or consequence.  She is 14 now and she's only going to push harder and want more independence then you are comfortable with or that is safe for her, so  yeah good luck with figuring that out. But that does need to be decided and agreed upon by both parents.  I would rather have toddlers again then go through any more teen years.", "YTA \n\nYou have zero understanding of how bad some cramps are. \n\nGet your kid to a gynecologist and get her checked out. \n\nFrom someone who took 8/8/8 Endone/panadol/Iboprofen each day for three days and was still vomiting and curled up dying. \n\nGet her checked out and get her appropriate pain killers and medical assistance", "I'm gonna say a soft NAH\n\nUnfortunately your daughter has built up \"crying wolf\" reputation for herself.  So now when she needs actual sick days, its hard to trust her. Its a gamble on whether she is being truthful or not. A hard reality of life is, sometimes we as uterus havers have to power through shit during our cycles. \n\nHowever, some peoples cycles are far worse than others and cramps can be debhilitating, beyond the help of water bottles/ibuprofen. When I'm having a heavy cycle pretty much everything falls to the wayside cause I am in too much discomfort or fatigue to keep up with the house.  If she is experiancing cramps that badly, perhaps its time to take her to a doctor. \n\nYou were in a tough spot. I personally think your wife is being a little too flippant about the position your daughter put everyone in.", "YTA. Periods should not be so painful that they cause absence. This is something that warrants further medical investigation. Ibuprofen on its own is insufficient. Such significant absence from school that there are risks of failing etc- also a stonkingly huge indicators that there is something going wrong for your daughter- maybe bullying or depression, but could also debility related to conditions like endometriosis. Why don\u2019t you and her mum have a handle on this OP? Your daughter is 14, she desperately needs Something. Chucking her painkillers and telling her to suck it up because her poor health is inconveniencing you. Sheesh.", "Speaking as one of the 10% of girls with endometriosis, whose chronic debilitating pain was dismissed as \"normal\" period pain for 15 years before I got a diagnosis: YTA. \n\nYou had good intentions, but you're still teaching your daughter you don't believe her when she talks about her lived experience of pain. It's a terrible precedent to set.", "YTA (until Info: why she skipped classed? Where were you and your wife? are answered)\n\nIf she has this bad cramps she need to see a doctor.

You have to care for you body and health.", "YTA mildly. I get that she misses school a lot but you should never ignore a medical concern. I say it as someone whe has endo and has legit crippling at times, I remember throwing up and seeing stars in classes back when I was a teen. You need to get her to see gynecologist asap.", "YTA\n\nTwo things can be true: your daughter has a problem with attendance AND has serious period pain.\n\nNo shade or shame to men, and y\u2019all have no idea how bad cramping can be, especially for adolescents. Because there is no \u201cvisible\u201d sign, it\u2019s super easy to underestimate how severe it actually is. And most US schools, well, the reasonable ones (context: I am staff for an education union) have policies in place that will allow students to miss days for period pain. They may have to do make up work, or participate in short-term online learning, but they won\u2019t be expelled or penalized for it.\n\nIf your daughter has attendance issues I recommend you advocate for time with her mental health team/counselor to address this. Especially if you are already at the point for CPS being involved. Badgering her over a very real (and historically dismissed) health issue will not help HER.\n\nEdit: typos", "Not uterus no opinion. Yes her attendance issues need addressed, but if wife thinks YTA on this one YTA has she been to the OBGYN yet? Is she on birth control that can cause issues?

Big time. \nI'll try to explain so that you get it: imagine someone is kicking you in the nuts. Really hard. And repeats this every 10 minutes. And expects you to go to school. And during the entire day at school you get your kick every 10 minutes. Would you like to stay home?\n\nThe fact that your child is skipping school should be adressed but not by torturing her.\n\nAnd you are an AH again because you made your wife leave work early in order to clean up your mess. You should at least have picked up your daughter  yourselve.", "YTA. - cramping can be excruciating.", "... a little bit of trust goes a long way, I think you better have a family meeting about this. \nMissing school is bad, I understand but she's your daughter, is she that untrustworthy? \nI'm worried about her not telling you something's wrong in the future because she'll think you'll just tell her to \"deal with it\".\n\nDefinitely take her to a doctor to check it out.\n\nIf she misses school and there isn't a valid reason, you should definitely find out what's going on there. There maybe other factors at work. Is she having trouble studying or is she having trouble with her peers? \n\nI want to say YTA but I also feel like theres a hell of a lot more to this that we don't know about.", "YTA. There's way more going on if your daughter is missing a lot of school. Even if you think she's only faking illness to get out of school, there's a reason for that. Is she getting bullied, does she have body dysmorphia or some other issue that makes going to school a living hell for her? Giving your kid a pill and shooing them off isn't gonna cut it in these times.", "YTA for not taking her to the doctor. you don\u2019t play with cramps the doctor will know if she\u2019s is lying or not", "Soft YTA.\n\nI understand you thinking she might be trying to milk it.

Normal periods are not painful, and pain is an indication that something is wrong.", "NAH\n\nIt's not like you sent her to school because you're a heartless monster who doesn't care about her pain. You did it because she could've gotten in big trouble with her school if she didn't attend (as there's no guarantee that writing the school a note would excuse her tardiness).\n\nBoth you and your wife just wanted what's best for your daughter.

Then imagine the entire world telling you that you\u2019re overexaggerating and that you have to perform 100%. You think you could do it?\n\nIf you think you can, I implore you to get a tens machine, hook it up across your lower abdomen and back, turn it to 80-100%, and go about your day completely normal with no complaints. *Then* I want you to remember that for some women that is considered *pain relief* because their actual cramps are *worse*.", "If your daughter is missing this much school there\u2019s another problem.

I assume we would not be having this discussion if it had ultimately turned out to be a health emergency. You gave her the medication. She needs to improve her attendance. Yes, cramps are a bother. I remember it brining tears to my eyes, when I was a teen, but the idea of skipping school because of that? No way. If, however, it is bothering her to such an extent that she cannot attend classes,  she should see a doctor ASAP.", "YTA. I suffered from bad bad cramps for years - two out of four weeks of the month. Even the docs didn\u2019t listen. Found out I had a uterus triple its size and stage four endometriosis. Get your daughter to a doctor. Don\u2019t let her suffer.", "YTA find yourself a good tens not a cheap tens unit. Put it on your lower abs and lower back muscles the crank that bitch up as far as it will go and then see how well you get out of bed and function with that baby cycling all day then maybe you will know a fraction of what period cramps are like AH.", "YTA. Poor attendance around her period? Get opinions from multiple gynos. Get her help.  Endo can be debilitating and you're just adding to her trauma by making her suck it up.  It'd the 21st century now -- it's broadly accepted and understood that endo can cause excruciating pain for a large amount of women. Deal with your daughter's PROBLEM, don't minimise it and ignore it.", "YTA- you need to find not just a gyn for your daughter, but one that is specialised in endom\u00e9trioses. One Ibuprofen is also not enough to get someone over an entire schoolday full of pain. And they damage the kidneys longterm, so she needs proper medication and being aware of the amount she is taking.", "Leaning towards YTA cause\n\n1) Minimising pain you simply can\u2019t understand and \u2018suck it up\u2019\n2) Dodging important questions \n\nA lot of people have asked why she has missed a lot of school and I agree that there\u2019s a good chance there\u2019s an undiagnosed condition at play.

I have a child that has attendance issues also due to anxiety & panic attacks but I work WITH HIM, not against him. I don\u2019t push him away and guess what, he trusts me more now because he knows that I believe him and believe in him. \n\nStart by taking her to a doctor and figure this out. She needs your support.", "YTA. BIG TIME. I get it. She has poor attendance. But cramps that bad? She needs to see a gynecologist or something. Personal experience: My dad was in his mid 50\u2019s to early 60\u2019s when I was a teenager. I could come to him and tell him when I needed to see a gynecologist or needed a bottle of Midol or if I needed pads or tampons. Being a man isn\u2019t an excuse for not trying to understand your daughter\u2019s menstrual cycle and how it affects her.", "Nta\n\nYou gave her medicine and a heat pad and sent her to school.\n\nShe's a school refuser and the cps are monitoring.

This is sounding odd to me. We had it, and was fine the following day or so. He went to work, and was fine. was fine yesterday then all of a sudden he is sick again when its time to go to school. My solution? He had a 3 minute lecture on the importance of attending school, and fine; stay home but we will be scheduling a doctors appointment this morning.

Not that difficult.", "I have debilitating cramps, on my worst days I can barely walk. I still have to go to work. I can see your pov and why you said no. Sounds like she can\u2019t be trusted, and you don\u2019t know if she\u2019s lying. But it should be pretty easy to tell. Does this happen every month? If so, she\u2019s not lying. If this is a new thing she could be lying or something could be wrong. Unless you prove she\u2019s lying both warrant a doctors appointment.

So combine those things & it was a perfect storm of avoiding school. It was the thing that always set off the anxiety & it was just a viscous cycle, i just avoided going to school as much as possible. The teachers & principals were always on me about my attendance, I was always one step away from \u201cauthorities being called\u201d because of my attendance, I couldn\u2019t get doctors notes to excuse the absences as medically necessary because no one cared back then compared to now. There\u2019s a lack of info from OP though to really determine the situation though, is the daughters bad attendance from just skipping & also is it affecting her grades? The grade thing is most important, I was still always a top student in my classes, my attendance wasn\u2019t affecting my learning, I didn\u2019t need to be in a stressful environment to do the assignments, not everyone thrives in a \u201csocial\u201d environment that those institutions insist are integral to education.

And let her know that you will continue to do so if she keeps skipping class.", "What are the consequences for this? What have you tried? Asking kindly. I was a kid who skipped. I was anxious and desperate to fit in, but mostly it was anxiety. \n\nCan you ask for the school to call the moment she\u2019s not there for attendance in a class following home room? Track her phone? Generally tracking one\u2019s child is bad behavior but in this case it\u2019s appropriate. She should know that when she skips, you physically will meet her where she is.", "When I was old enough to drive to school and there were decent waves, I'd end up at the beach with my surfboard instead.  As far as my parents knew, I was at school though because I left at my normal time.", "Oh no that's terrible! It's normal for your period to hurt but it being so bad as a heart attack is quite concerning... Have you had a check up or told a doctor? It really shouldn't be that painful.", "Exactly.   She could suffer appropriate consequence for lying and sneaking off.   Making her go to school when she's in pain, isn't that.", "Yeah, it's the schools fault for allowing kids to sneak away so easily, but the pattern of behavior is on the parents to correct. If this was her being a bully to another student or acting out and being disruptive in the classroom, her parents would be expected to be part of the process of ensuring the behavior ends alongside the school, skipping class habitually is the same setup.", "Because hanging out with your friends is more fun?", "You're getting downcoted cause you gave a dumb response while acting smug about it", "He says they drop her off\u2026", "I don't think OP is expecting that forcing her to go to school while in pain would stop her from skipping in the future. The problem is that she's skipped so much at this point that she's now facing actual, real world consequences for it beyond just a slap on the wrist, like having CPS sent to her home, and OP can't just willingly let her stay home anymore *because* she skipped so much.", "I missed at least a day and a half every month. Debilitating pain and even passed out a few times. Lived in a hot water bath for hours. \n\nOP - see a gyn and get your daughter treatment. My suffering could have been alleviated just by being on birth control that stabilized the hormone surges/drops (for me it's the estrogen drop so I use BC continuously (no days off)) but my parents refused to let me be on BC because \"catholic.\" I'm still pissed that my pain meant less than how they were worried of being perceived.", "I did! And the school says they can\u2019t stop them when their already heading to the woods or in the woods. We get a call at the end of the day, or when it happens if their able to identify it\u2019s our daughter. The rec center said they can\u2019t do much either because it\u2019s hard to identify which kids from the school, other then backpacks. A nice member from the rec does call us if he\u2019s working that day and sees her but he doesn\u2019t work often, and the rec members only work indoors", "Boy who cried wolf situation.  She's skipped enough that she no longer gets the benefit of the doubt.", "I disagree, you dont have to always want to hang out with friends. I can want to skip school and also not hang out with friends instead.", "This is true, drs can be very dismissive, even when you are older.  After my 1st round of covid, a few weeks later developed really bad chest pain, it didn't get better, this went on several days before I took myself to the ER, I was riddled with lung clots and hospitalized 3 days on Heparin and then put on blood thinners.\n\nI was about to come off them when I got my 2nd bout of Covid, few weeks later same chest pain, this time I listened to my gut, but luckily was clear and it was pleurisy instead, so steroids and cough medication and a lecture on taking my blood thinners consistently. \n\nGuess what, I STILL have chest pain, now I just ignore it, luckily I do have a cardio follow-up, maybe they will figure it out.  \n\nSo many times we are made to not listen to our gut and get dismissed, I think the issues with cramps, etc at a young age, is we know they haven't had years of strong estrogen running through you that starts generating problems, and it is unusual for younger girls/women to have the complications older women do, we also know because of age, they sometimes lack the maturity/endurance/built pain tolerance to know the difference between cramps and CRAMPS lol, but I agree a better job needs to be done to address it with a Dr and proper care.\n\nI mean I always had very heavy/bad ones, but in recalling the events, my cramps at 14 that seemed unbearable... were NOT the cramps I had in my 30's riddled with cysts, fibroids and endo, by a long shot.", "From my experience, pain killers don't do as good a job as ibuprofen for cramps.", "I'm not sure why people are down voting this. Your comments are probably the most reasonable here. It's wild to me that op is refusing to see these as two separate problems that need to be addressed in two very different ways.", "We do but it comes after school and makes all the periods", "Oof. I'm having flashbacks to teenage me. And my sisters as teenagers. I luckily never had a major attendance issue because I had anxiety about getting bad grades but my sister DID have a major attendance issue that led to her dropping out. I tried to get out of school with cramps with my mom but I was dumb and didn't consider the fact that she's a NICU/L&D nurse and would call my ass out for trying to use that excuse on day 3 or 4 of my period. If she was to lay down in the nurse's office, would she be counted as absent?", "lmao I call in late when I have bad cramps and sleep an extra house. I work out of an office, alone, so I am able to cope, I just get so sleepy during my period. I don't think my (female) supervisor excuse me calling out the whole day for my period though.", "She can leave after homeroom. I drop her off watch her walk in the doors", "She skips to hangout with her friends, she told us fhat", ">my parents didn\u2019t know about it for months until the school called threatening that I wouldn\u2019t finish the year if I didn\u2019t knock it off.\n\nOP is already at that point.  They seem to have put no effort into figuring out what the kid is doing during school hours.", "But if you missed enough school, the school leadership would talk to your parents about it.  Good parents would try to get to the bottom of where the kid goes during school hours.  it doesn't seem like OP has done that.", "Yeah, it baffles me that people don't seem to get this. Tons of kids in my school skipped and ran off into the woods, and the reasoning was....they didn't want to be in school. School is boring; hanging out with your friends is fun. Of course there *could* be something deeper, and OP should obviously do whatever he can to figure out if there's something going on, but I'd bet money that his daughter just would rather hang out with her friends than go to class. \n\nAs I was typing this, I decided to check out OP's comments, and yep, that's [exactly why she does it](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11d6gwq/aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_go_to_school_with/ja91p7c/?context=3).", "Are you saying teenagers don't rip dab cartridges? Find that hard to believe", "I had a kidney stone that I thought was just cramps till the last two hours when I finally went to the hospital. Haven\u2019t been in labor yet but my bad cramps were nearly a kidney stone level of pain.", "Aw man I had an unplanned c-section after 17 hours labour and 3 hours pushing, complete with the rip. \n\nThen the c section wound burst a week later\n\nIt all sucks all of it", "As someone who had no drug intervention during delivery\u2026I can tell you nothing hurts more than childbirth", "It's not though. Skip school for one reason, it's not much of a leap to suggest she skips it for others.\n\nFaking period pains to get out of school is pretty low, so clearly the dad doesn't have a good opinion of her attitude. Whether she brought that on herself or not I don't think we know as we've only got snippets of info.", "Ok, so she skips when she does go to school...\n\nIs lying curled up with a heating pad the same thing or an actual medical problem?", "Probably because I suggested that high school kids are not ok right now and they need mental health supports. Oh and that I said our schools are suffering. Far easier to just believe a kid is bad and that educators are lazy.", "This is a really weird level of apathy from the school, most places would have found a way to lock down campus when it's a problem this bad. School board?", "Info: You're saying she goes to homeroom, then skips out? If so, the onus is on the school at that point. School board and/or superintendent needs to be informed of what's happening.", "No, that\u2019s the situation she prefers. Not the motivation. Is she anxious? Is there a reason she isn\u2019t friends with some of the kids who prioritize their education and stay in class? Why is she falling in with kids who don\u2019t attend school? What substances are they into?", "And you think all American schools have gates, and that no American school has gates?\n\nI could be from the same country as you, and not have gone to a school with gates. I could be American and have gone to a school with gates.\n\nAlso, you seriously think kids can't manage to leave school if it has gates? I've heard some crazy ass stories from friends about how they cut class at their schools which had gates. \n\nAnd also, because if you actually read and understood what op said, you'd see that he takes his daughter to school, and then she leaves after. \n\nSo your suggestion is basically \"why don't you do something that you're already doing?\"", "So similar for me. My baby is 2 weeks old today, when I started having contractions I did notice that I was having cramping but I was still wondering if they were contractions. They didn't actually start to hurt until about 5 hours before he came out - almost 24hrs after they had started.", "Samesies! I didn't realize I was in labor at first because it felt like period cramps. (I have endometriosis.)\n\nEvery book and article I'd read described contractions as \"rolling waves\". Yeah, no.", "Hahaha same! We went to the hospital based on contractions and they tried to tell me I wasn\u2019t bad so to go home. They checked me and I was 7cm!!!! Having PCOS made me able to width stand labor, not that it wasn\u2019t painful but that I was used to this level of pain", "Never been pregnant, but I had major surgery a few years ago (without going into detail, it required removing a piece of bone) and made it through the first night in the hospital with nothing but IV and ibuprofen. The attendings were impressed \"that I didn't accept any of the good stuff\" and I was *this close* to saying \"I've had period cramps hurt infinitely worse than this post-surgery stuff and nobody offered me the good stuff then, soooo...\" In retrospect, I so wish I'd said it.", "Probably. It's sad though, it's all true and easily verified", "Thank you, that's exactly what I was thinking!", "Me too! They wanted to send me home and I made them check me. 7cm!!!! Lady I have PCOS. These pains are like a normal thing for me.", "I had a 6 day failed induction followed by a c-section. I have the same weird disappointment. I have had IBS for most of my life and none of the contractions came anywhere near that pain. But I never went into \"real labor\", so there's no way of knowing! The c-section recovery was so easy for me that if I get pregnant again, trying for a vbac seems like a really extreme way to try to prove myself. I didn't really go on the internet the first few weeks, so I had no idea how bad the recovery is for most women!", "Can I give you a big secret?  You are going to be sooooo happy to had a c-section when you are....let's say 50 and your pelvic floors muscles aren't mush and you don't have to cross your legs when you cough.....or sneeze or god forbid trip.\n\nPlus I recovered from my C-section 100 times faster than my VBAC because I was a moron and no one told me this information.  But my first delivery was an emergency emergency C-section so I didn't get to be awake and that was really emotionally tough.  So I didn't want to miss anything the second time---I'm a dummy.", "I admit that I took exactly one education class before deciding I wasn't doing that, but one of the key points was that the school is legally responsible for the children while they are there the exact term is \"in loco parentis\"", "A location tracker on her phone? Something she can't remove or turn off location that only the parents have control of? Don't know if things like this exist, I was lucky enough not to have those issues.", "I didn\u2019t know I was in labour until they told me I in fact was and not only that I was already 8cm dilated lmaoo", "Ouch! Good thing you made them check you. My mom was in labor with #3 I think? And they were trying to send her home because she wasn\u2019t showing enough pain, but she had already had 2 without an epidural so she was chill. I don\u2019t remember how dilated but they finally took her in after checking her. Crazy how it\u2019s so vastly different from one person to another", "Yup, I don't see myself ever pushing back if a C-section is recommended in the future, either. My disappointment about not getting to prove my toughness in labor is an ok thing to feel but not an ok thing to base medical decisions on. Also there are plenty of reasons I'm glad it went the way it did - knowing the date ahead of time was nice for me, and almost all the time I spent in the hospital was WITH my baby, learning to take care of him. Some parents I know were discharged so quickly after giving birth that they still felt like they didn't know anything.", "Exactly - it's highly personal. I've got a friend who honestly thought labour was gas pains... She was SHOCKED when her water broke and she went to the hospital and the med  student who examined her was 'Oh, crap, I can see the head'.\n\nPeriods can be nothing - my SiL is one of those 'Oh, hey, blood, I guess it's my period'; me? Yeah, even with an IUD and a bunch of surgeries to clean out scar tissue, I'm a stone cold disaster three days a month - but at least I'm a FUNCTIONAL disaster, not hanging over a toilet and bleeding myself into anemia and blood transfusions, which was not a one-time thing for me.\n\nOP has no way of knowing just HOW bad things are for their kid; and it doesn't sound like they believe it's an 'issue'. My dad? My dad held my hair when I puked, carried me to the bathroom when I couldn't stand, washed my sheets and clothes when I bled through everything. He took me to the hospital, and he stayed through the needles and transfusions. My mom was and is awesome, but my dad was the 'hands on, don't wory about a thing, I'll take care of it' guy. \n\nOP needs to consider what they want their daughter to remember about this.", "She just likes to go hangout with friends"]}
