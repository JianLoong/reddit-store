Is it always illness, or other reasons? You mentioned skipping, what\u2019s her reasoning for skipping?\n\n\nHave you taken her a doctor to see if she might have endometriosis or PCOS?", "You need to take your daughter to a doctor about her cramps if they're so painful she needs to miss school.

All the woman in my family suffer from bad cramps my mom even had to go to the ER when she was younger due to the pain so we were all put on birth control and it helps", "NAH  But you and your wife need desperately to be on the same page with discipline with your daughter.   It's no joke that united front.  Because I can see where you are correct in the loss of trust and her mother's concern for the monthly cramps issue.  So Dr. appt for the monthly's to be sure there is no underlying health issue and open discussion on how to treat that pain with all 3 of you.  And another ongoing conversation between you and your wife about allowing your daughter to do an end run around either of you whenever she doesn't like the answer or consequence.  She is 14 now and she's only going to push harder and want more independence then you are comfortable with or that is safe for her, so  yeah good luck with figuring that out. But that does need to be decided and agreed upon by both parents.  I would rather have toddlers again then go through any more teen years.", "YTA \n\nYou have zero understanding of how bad some cramps are. \n\nGet your kid to a gynecologist and get her checked out. \n\nFrom someone who took 8/8/8 Endone/panadol/Iboprofen each day for three days and was still vomiting and curled up dying. \n\nGet her checked out and get her appropriate pain killers and medical assistance", "I'm gonna say a soft NAH\n\nUnfortunately your daughter has built up \"crying wolf\" reputation for herself.  So now when she needs actual sick days, its hard to trust her. Its a gamble on whether she is being truthful or not. A hard reality of life is, sometimes we as uterus havers have to power through shit during our cycles. \n\nHowever, some peoples cycles are far worse than others and cramps can be debhilitating, beyond the help of water bottles/ibuprofen. When I'm having a heavy cycle pretty much everything falls to the wayside cause I am in too much discomfort or fatigue to keep up with the house.  If she is experiancing cramps that badly, perhaps its time to take her to a doctor. \n\nYou were in a tough spot. I personally think your wife is being a little too flippant about the position your daughter put everyone in.", "YTA. Periods should not be so painful that they cause absence. This is something that warrants further medical investigation. Ibuprofen on its own is insufficient. Such significant absence from school that there are risks of failing etc- also a stonkingly huge indicators that there is something going wrong for your daughter- maybe bullying or depression, but could also debility related to conditions like endometriosis. Why don\u2019t you and her mum have a handle on this OP? Your daughter is 14, she desperately needs Something. Chucking her painkillers and telling her to suck it up because her poor health is inconveniencing you. Sheesh.", "Speaking as one of the 10% of girls with endometriosis, whose chronic debilitating pain was dismissed as \"normal\" period pain for 15 years before I got a diagnosis: YTA. \n\nYou had good intentions, but you're still teaching your daughter you don't believe her when she talks about her lived experience of pain. It's a terrible precedent to set.", "YTA (until Info: why she skipped classed? Where were you and your wife? are answered)\n\nIf she has this bad cramps she need to see a doctor. As a human without menstruations you couldn't understand how this cramps feel like. \nAnd to \"suck it up\" and make your own medication isn't a good role model for her further life. You have to care for you body and health.", "YTA mildly. I get that she misses school a lot but you should never ignore a medical concern. I say it as someone whe has endo and has legit crippling at times, I remember throwing up and seeing stars in classes back when I was a teen. You need to get her to see gynecologist asap.", "YTA\n\nTwo things can be true: your daughter has a problem with attendance AND has serious period pain.\n\nNo shade or shame to men, and y\u2019all have no idea how bad cramping can be, especially for adolescents. Because there is no \u201cvisible\u201d sign, it\u2019s super easy to underestimate how severe it actually is. And most US schools, well, the reasonable ones (context: I am staff for an education union) have policies in place that will allow students to miss days for period pain. They may have to do make up work, or participate in short-term online learning, but they won\u2019t be expelled or penalized for it.\n\nIf your daughter has attendance issues I recommend you advocate for time with her mental health team/counselor to address this. Especially if you are already at the point for CPS being involved. Badgering her over a very real (and historically dismissed) health issue will not help HER.\n\nEdit: typos", "Not uterus no opinion. Yes her attendance issues need addressed, but if wife thinks YTA on this one YTA has she been to the OBGYN yet? Is she on birth control that can cause issues? Do you know anything about her reproductive health of just think it can't possibly be all that bad?", "YTA. Big time. \nI'll try to explain so that you get it: imagine someone is kicking you in the nuts. Really hard. And repeats this every 10 minutes. And expects you to go to school. And during the entire day at school you get your kick every 10 minutes. Would you like to stay home?\n\nThe fact that your child is skipping school should be adressed but not by torturing her.\n\nAnd you are an AH again because you made your wife leave work early in order to clean up your mess. You should at least have picked up your daughter  yourselve.", "YTA. - cramping can be excruciating.", "... a little bit of trust goes a long way, I think you better have a family meeting about this. \nMissing school is bad, I understand but she's your daughter, is she that untrustworthy? \nI'm worried about her not telling you something's wrong in the future because she'll think you'll just tell her to \"deal with it\".\n\nDefinitely take her to a doctor to check it out.\n\nIf she misses school and there isn't a valid reason, you should definitely find out what's going on there. There maybe other factors at work. Is she having trouble studying or is she having trouble with her peers? \n\nI want to say YTA but I also feel like theres a hell of a lot more to this that we don't know about.", "YTA. There's way more going on if your daughter is missing a lot of school. Even if you think she's only faking illness to get out of school, there's a reason for that. Is she getting bullied, does she have body dysmorphia or some other issue that makes going to school a living hell for her? Giving your kid a pill and shooing them off isn't gonna cut it in these times.", "YTA for not taking her to the doctor. you don\u2019t play with cramps the doctor will know if she\u2019s is lying or not", "Soft YTA.\n\nI understand you thinking she might be trying to milk it.

Normal periods are not painful, and pain is an indication that something is wrong.", "NAH\n\nIt's not like you sent her to school because you're a heartless monster who doesn't care about her pain. You did it because she could've gotten in big trouble with her school if she didn't attend (as there's no guarantee that writing the school a note would excuse her tardiness).\n\nBoth you and your wife just wanted what's best for your daughter.

Then imagine the entire world telling you that you\u2019re overexaggerating and that you have to perform 100%. You think you could do it?\n\nIf you think you can, I implore you to get a tens machine, hook it up across your lower abdomen and back, turn it to 80-100%, and go about your day completely normal with no complaints. *Then* I want you to remember that for some women that is considered *pain relief* because their actual cramps are *worse*.", "If your daughter is missing this much school there\u2019s another problem.

As a teenager, i had them so bad i fainted sometimes... Even at scholl, really great. Not. If she has her period and has bad cramps, YTA.", "NTA. I assume we would not be having this discussion if it had ultimately turned out to be a health emergency. You gave her the medication. She needs to improve her attendance. Yes, cramps are a bother. I remember it brining tears to my eyes, when I was a teen, but the idea of skipping school because of that? No way. If, however, it is bothering her to such an extent that she cannot attend classes,  she should see a doctor ASAP.", "YTA. I suffered from bad bad cramps for years - two out of four weeks of the month. Even the docs didn\u2019t listen. Found out I had a uterus triple its size and stage four endometriosis. Get your daughter to a doctor. Don\u2019t let her suffer.", "YTA find yourself a good tens not a cheap tens unit. Put it on your lower abs and lower back muscles the crank that bitch up as far as it will go and then see how well you get out of bed and function with that baby cycling all day then maybe you will know a fraction of what period cramps are like AH.", "YTA. Poor attendance around her period? Get opinions from multiple gynos. Get her help.  Endo can be debilitating and you're just adding to her trauma by making her suck it up.  It'd the 21st century now -- it's broadly accepted and understood that endo can cause excruciating pain for a large amount of women. Deal with your daughter's PROBLEM, don't minimise it and ignore it.", "YTA- you need to find not just a gyn for your daughter, but one that is specialised in endom\u00e9trioses. One Ibuprofen is also not enough to get someone over an entire schoolday full of pain. And they damage the kidneys longterm, so she needs proper medication and being aware of the amount she is taking.", "Leaning towards YTA cause\n\n1) Minimising pain you simply can\u2019t understand and \u2018suck it up\u2019\n2) Dodging important questions \n\nA lot of people have asked why she has missed a lot of school and I agree that there\u2019s a good chance there\u2019s an undiagnosed condition at play.

You are her parent - when she says she\u2019s in pain, sure give her pain relief but at least TRY to help her figure out why it\u2019s so bad. Because like others have said - it can be *horrendous*. \n\nEven if she\u2019s covering to get out of school, talk to her, figure this out or it will continue. I have a child that has attendance issues also due to anxiety & panic attacks but I work WITH HIM, not against him. I don\u2019t push him away and guess what, he trusts me more now because he knows that I believe him and believe in him. \n\nStart by taking her to a doctor and figure this out. She needs your support.", "YTA. BIG TIME. I get it. She has poor attendance. But cramps that bad? She needs to see a gynecologist or something. Personal experience: My dad was in his mid 50\u2019s to early 60\u2019s when I was a teenager. I could come to him and tell him when I needed to see a gynecologist or needed a bottle of Midol or if I needed pads or tampons. Being a man isn\u2019t an excuse for not trying to understand your daughter\u2019s menstrual cycle and how it affects her.", "Nta\n\nYou gave her medicine and a heat pad and sent her to school.\n\nShe's a school refuser and the cps are monitoring.  Obviously all the notes your wife doesn't mind writing don't cut it anymore.  You can't trust your daughter to be honest about her medical issues, so what you did was the sensible thing to do.

This is sounding odd to me. We had it, and was fine the following day or so. He went to work, and was fine. was fine yesterday then all of a sudden he is sick again when its time to go to school. My solution? He had a 3 minute lecture on the importance of attending school, and fine; stay home but we will be scheduling a doctors appointment this morning.

Not that difficult.", "I have debilitating cramps, on my worst days I can barely walk. I still have to go to work. I can see your pov and why you said no. Sounds like she can\u2019t be trusted, and you don\u2019t know if she\u2019s lying. But it should be pretty easy to tell. Does this happen every month? If so, she\u2019s not lying. If this is a new thing she could be lying or something could be wrong. Unless you prove she\u2019s lying both warrant a doctors appointment.

The teachers & principals were always on me about my attendance, I was always one step away from \u201cauthorities being called\u201d because of my attendance, I couldn\u2019t get doctors notes to excuse the absences as medically necessary because no one cared back then compared to now. There\u2019s a lack of info from OP though to really determine the situation though, is the daughters bad attendance from just skipping & also is it affecting her grades? The grade thing is most important, I was still always a top student in my classes, my attendance wasn\u2019t affecting my learning, I didn\u2019t need to be in a stressful environment to do the assignments, not everyone thrives in a \u201csocial\u201d environment that those institutions insist are integral to education. It honestly felt like the teachers & principals at my schools were always so angry at me for NOT having shitty grades to go along with the shitty attendance.", "What does the daughter need to do to prove herself, throw a used pad at his face?", "Fai enough, but need to know what mom has done about it. If it's a health issue and mother hasn't done anything yet then it's even bigger problem.", "Hes her father so he has an opinion but he needs a better-informed one. Also, why is this child missing so many days otherwise?", "This is genius", "[deleted]", "Plus, I want to add that you are not just in pain during the menstruation days, when you are having endo or another pain inducing illness. The cramps caused my teeth to move and later ob lead to Heavy headaches and migraines because I grit my teeth badly. \nMissing school due to being in pain is a r\u00e9al thing. School is very stressful compared to work or going to university, stress Leads to higher pain too.", "That\u2019s all well and good, but, this is from a child. Children lie to get out of school ALL the time. If I was allowed to stay home every time I had a stomach ache or a sniffle I\u2019d have been taken into foster care. Op did what they thought was the reasonable thing to help relieve the pain and keep the authorities happy with their child\u2019s attendance.\n\nNAH", "Homeschooling is almost always a terrible idea.", "Yes; that\u2019s the idea.  Remove the child from social interaction, quit a job and provide an unskilled take on eduction whilst ensuring her work/life balance is ruined.  That\u2019s obviously the first port of call\u2026", "Vape weed and discuss the planet being on fire. And how much millennials suck for parting their hair to the side lol", "I'm also in the US. There are bad doctors and good ones - hopefully this parent can find a good one who will listen to his child.", "Same. My main problem was always cramps and vomiting. The gyno put me on the pill, which made me nauseous every morning for a week until I stopped taking it (which in hindsight is a blessing in disguise because I have a connective tissue problem that can become worse because of hormonal birth control, and it\u2019s also probably the reason for my cramp problems).", ">Hes her father so he has an opinion\n\nNot on menstrual cramps he doesn't", "For plenty of women there is nothing to be done", "Sounds like you have a pretty limited perspective of it. And for a bonus the kids don\u2019t have to worry about getting shot. Imagine that", "Irony of ironies you don\u2019t sound very educated on the matter. So the alternative is to trust your children in the hands of perfect strangers who can\u2019t protect them from a shooting. Gotcha", "if you thing teens \u201cvape weed\u201d and discuss ANYTHING millennials do you really must be old, I bet you say adulting too lmao", "I wish I was homeschooled. 'Normal' school is almost always a terrible idea.", "2nd sentence is the most American thing I've heard all day.", "You seem to be addressing the wrong question then; sounds like you need to vote for a better-funded education system and gun control.", "So true. I'm a millennial, I say adulting, and even /I/ know gen z isn't interested in us. Vaping weed does make it go further though so if they aren't onto that they should look into it...", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 12: [This Is Not A Debate Sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). \r\n\r\n>No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**"]}
