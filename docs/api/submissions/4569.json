The BG: Mom was married to my bio dad. They had my older brother and sister and then there was a 6 year gap between them and me and my younger brother. Our bio dad died when my brother was a newborn and I was 18ish months. Our mom met the man I call dad when I was 3 and they married after a year together. My sister is the same age as me and her bio mom died.\n\nSo she, my brother and I saw mom and dad as mom and dad. We also considered each other siblings, not stepsiblings.\n\nMy older brother and sister did not see her as their sister or dad as their dad. They made it very clear he would never be their dad and that they only had one.\n\nMy parents and them butted heads over the years because they loved on me and my younger brother, but not on my sister. They also made the distinction everywhere they went that he was not their dad and was to be listed as guardian instead of parent in school and extra curricular's (which from what I understand is how the forms are filled out if they are not listed as mom/dad, at least in the school's I've been in and the activities I have attended).\n\nMy sister always got it like my brother and I did. We didn't remember our late bio parents. My older siblings did.\n\nMy parents never liked it.\n\nNow I'm 16 and my older siblings moved out, and there's a lot of strain in the relationship between them and mom. My parents and my (step) sister are now all bothered by their ongoing relationship with me and my brother but not the rest of the family. Over the years my parents have asked me to ask them to come home for Christmas, they wanted me to encourage them to move back in when Covid was first starting and lockdowns were coming in. I'd often get told to ask them to come to my sister's birthday parties. All that stuff. My older siblings would always so no and at first they were fine with it, but being asked repeatedly gets old and I can hear they get more frustrated. Now the Christmas thing has come up again only my parents and my sister were on my case about it. Saying they will say yes to me, etc. I ended up snapping and telling them I am tired of being put in the middle and it isn't fair because they will ruin my relationship with my siblings if they keep expecting me to ask when the boundaries were drawn already. \n\nMy sister was so hurt that I snapped at her and said she's tired of being treated as less than (even though I never have) and my parents said I had no right to be mad at them when it's my older siblings fault.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670859597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk2fb6/aita_for_snapping_at_my_parents_and_sister_and/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don't have to acknowledge step family as actual family if they don't want to. That's their right. It's horrible that your parents put you in the middle I can't imagine the struggle. Your parents need to understand that nobody is obligated to love them and treat them as family. You should sit down and have an honest conversation and explain that while it's hard to have a divide in the family it's not your responsibility to fix it.", "NTA do not let them guilt trip you into continuing to be the one asking (I assume that's exactly what they will try to do). Not only is your point of it putting your relationship with your siblings at risk incredibly valid, but you also don't have to do anything you don't want to regardless of reason. \nThey are trying to emotionally manipulate your siblings into coming to gatherings by using you as bait. I'm glad they never fell for that, and I hope you can manage to stand your ground against them.", "You have every right to be mad at them because they\u2019re the ones pushing you to do something you don\u2019t want. It\u2019s not your job to manage their relationship with your older siblings, and they need to be grownup about it and take some responsibility. They can push all the boundaries they want if that\u2019s what they want - but themselves, not through you - and they should be prepared to relationships to sour massively.", "NTA, you tried to help both your parents and siblings to make their relationship stronger, even tho you didn't even have to. If the parents want a better relationship with the kids, they should've made a plan since the beginning.\n\nYou can't do anything if neither of the sides are willing to talk to eachother or to even try to get contact themselfs.\n\nThem putting the strains on you and blaming you for their relationship, is fucking bullshit. You did what you could do, and that's all you can. You're young and you should be able to enjoy the attention and memories with your family. I wish you success and I hope the problem gets resolved!", "NTA. Good for you for setting boundaries.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is TA for trying to force relationships that are not there, to make her vision of one big family a reality.  I am guessing this is why your older siblings are LC with her.  \n\nNo one is going to change your older siblings' feelings.  They remember their father and always considered your mother's husband that, their mother's husband, and by extension his child a step child.  There is no crime in their feelings, they are valid and understandable.\n\nYou may want to talk to your (step) sister when things have calmed down a bit.  Make sure she understands that you still love her as a sister and that will not change, but help her ease into the reality that your older siblings are just her older step siblings that have moved on/out.  I am sure she find it painful, but hopefully she will eventually find peace with it.", "NTA! It's your parents' responsibility to attempt to mend those relationships. Your elder siblings need to understand that your Mother is allowed to move on though, she is allowed fall in love again, have a life after being widowed & share her love with other people. Your siblings also need to understand that fostering the new relationships does not take away from the love they have for you guys' biological father. They are not disrespecting his memory by being cordial/civil with their stepfather and his children. The children do not deserve to be mistreated, excluded, labeled, singled out etc. It's no one's fault but, everyone needs to understand exactly that. No one is at fault because people die. Life will always go on. Nonetheless, your parents should not be putting this on you at all.  All of you need to sit down and talk about how punishing each other over these things is only creating more wedges & unnecessary drama. And again, NTA! Not at all.", "NTA. Your parents & sister need to take these problems up with the people they actually have the problems with. It's not your fault your older siblings feel however they feel, & pushing on them per your parents' & other sister's demands may damage whatever relationship you have with them. I'm sorry your sister feels excluded, but it's a situation you have no control over, & they all need to stop expecting miracles out of you.", "NTA - you do not have to be the mediator in all of this.  If they want them to come, they need to invite them.  And accept when they say no.\n\nThis was a tough situation for all.  Your older siblings felt the loss of your dad pretty substantially, and then had to deal with a \"new family\" starting. and not feeling as included as you younger kids did.  Your mom was widowed with 4 kids, including 2 babies (yikes).  Your step family also had a hard loss.  It sucks that there's tension, but you all had some trauma, and sometimes that leads to issues like this.  You're right to just advocate for yourself and keep your own relationships healthy.", "NTA  This whole mess is your parents fault.  They are still trying to force relationships that their target do not want.", "NTA- Your mom and step father shouldn't put you in the middle but I know it happens all the time in a lot of families.    Have you ever ask your your older brother and sister why they feel like this?  I understand you not wanting to ruin the relationship with your older siblings but how do you feel about your older siblings feeling this way towards your step father and younger sister?", "NTA and ESH, you're not an AH for setting boundaries but I feel sad for your sister :c", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do remember that. When civility wasn't there is when they were asked why he couldn't be listed as their parent, why they had to make the correction. They also didn't like that they treated me and my brother different to my sister. Like I get why it would be great if things were just family, and nobody was treated differently, but they didn't want another dad and my sister was never just a sister in their eyes and I can't blame them for that. If my parents could have accepted the relationships they had with the rest of the family would not be the same as the ones us younger three had, I don't think we'd have the split we have today.\n\nI also know my sister used to get it too.
