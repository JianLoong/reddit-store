{"id": 30854, "submission_id": "17tqxy7", "title": "AITA for telling the mailbox store attendant to go home?", "selftext": "My partner and I rent a box at a nearby mailbox store.  We do this so that we have a safe place to have packages delivered to, without either of us needing to be home to take delivery or risking theft of packages left at the door.  We typically pick up the delivered packages on Saturdays.  The mailbox store is open until 3PM on Saturdays and is closed on Sundays.  The store is about a 6-8 minute drive from our house.\n\nYesterday was Saturday.  My partner went to the grocery store and then made it to the mailbox store shortly before 3PM.  He picked up the items that had been delivered for us over the course of the week.  He returned home at 3:02PM, took off his shoes, changed out of his pants, and started sorting through his groceries and the packages.  At 3:07PM he realized that one of the packages was missing.  He immediately called the store and the mailbox store attendant answered the phone, despite it being after closing time.  My partner asked whether the missing package was still at the store.  After a minute or two the employee said yes, he had found it.  My partner asked if the attendant would mind staying an extra 10 minutes so that he could go pick up the package.  The attendant agreed.  My partner thanked him very much and hung up the phone.  It was now 3:10PM\n\nAfter my partner hung up the phone, he went into the kitchen.  He pulled some items out and began to wash a thermos.  I asked him what he was doing.  He said was preparing himself a smoothie.  I asked him why he would prepare himself a smoothie when he has to get to the mailbox store so that the attendant, who is waiting for him, can give him the package.  He says it will only take a couple minutes, and he can take the smoothie with him.  He continues to prepare the smoothie and, at 3:15PM, it appears he is done.\n\nAt this point he sits down and starts sipping his smoothie while looking at his phone.  I ask him if he is going to go now.  He says he needs to put on his shoes and pants.  I ask if he is going to put his pants and shoes back on and he says he will in a minute.  He continues to look at his phone and drink his smoothie.\n\nAt 3:18PM, without discussing with my partner, I call the mailbox store.  The attendant replies and I tell him that, while we thank him for waiting, we are unable to get to the store in a timely manner and he should go home.  My partner overhears it, tries to tell me to tell him he\u2019ll be there in 10 minutes, but I complete the call without doing that.  My partner calls back but there is no answer.  He quickly changes into his pants, puts on his shoes, rushes to the car and drives to the mailbox store.  By the time he gets there the attendant is gone.  My partner returns home and is angry with me for telling the attendant to go home and also for not asking him to stay another 10 minutes.  Now he will have to wait until Monday to pick up the missing package.

This employee was doing them a favor and instead of going straight there so the employee wouldn\u2019t have to wait too long they proceeded to do other things", "NTA.

You handled this brilliantly.", "NTA it was polite of the employee to pick up the phone after store hours and very kind to wait for your husband to pick up the missing package. But that doesn't mean husband is supposed to pick the slowest, most convenient time for himself to drive over and get the package. Kudos for you for not allowing this abuse. \n\nWhen I worked in retail I was often left speechless by the incredible rudeness and selfish behaviour from customers: knocking on the locked front door to just browse, staying well after closing to buy items and then wanting friends who were outside the store to come in and look over the items (that was totally bonkers and we told her to make her purchase or go), and even being offered partially eaten food because I was helpful.", "Surely you meant to say \"ex-partner\"? Because how could he still be your partner after showing how clearly an A H he is. \n\nYou will never be able to depend on this person. I think he was delivered to the wrong address and you need to return him to the bog he rose from. \n\nNTA (And kudos for caring about others.)", "NTA. You gave your partner every opportunity to get there in a timely manner, yet they chose to waste the time of everyone involved.\n\nAll you did was be responsible and respectful of the attendants time, which is far more than I can say for your partner. This is absolutely red flag behavior on their part.", "NTA. Your partner, however, is a pr\\*ck.", "MTA, and tell your partner that he's and incredibly rude asshole. Sincerely, everyone who has to work with the public and is forced to wait on stupid customers disrespecting our time.", "1st rule. Don\u2019t answer phone after closing time.

Please seriously consider if you want to be partners with this jerk.

Your partner is exactly the reason most people would never do anything like this for someone.  He was incredibly arrogant and dismissive of someone else's time.  Your partner is the AH.

Your partner is an inconsiderate jerkwad.", "Damn I love you\u2763\ufe0f NTA", "NTA and for the benefit of those who have never worked retail, I\u2019ll tell you why.  \n1) most retail stores have policies prohibiting customers from entering the premises after closing.  This is to protect employees who may be counting tills and completing closing duties that can\u2019t be done during operating hours.  \n2) most companies also set time limits for employees on how long it should take to complete closing procedures and setting the building alarms.  \n\nThat employee was probably breaking a ton of rules by doing a nice thing and staying late for your spouse, possibly risking a write-up and/or probation/termination.  You were correct in telling him to leave.  Clearly, your husband is an inconsiderate asshole in this scenario.", "NTA.

Your partner is being a dick. \n\nSince I have dealt with an inordinate amount of dicks over my lifetime, your partner likely felt entitled to waste the retail worker's time because it was the worker's \"fault\" for missing the one package. \n\nAt its' most basic, it is a power move. And he is mad at you because he is justified in his actions. The worker has the obligation to make it up to him, after all.", "NTA, but you partner sure is.", "NTA. That was the nice thing to do. Your partner clearly wasn't treating the person decently. \n\nI also have a box at a UPS store and would never do that to the people who work there. Mine has a couple of large boxes they use for people to pick up after hours. They leave the key in your box, and then you collect your package from the larger box and put the key back in yours. Does your place have that? When I know I can't make it before they close, I ask if one of those drop boxes are open if it's something I actually need asap.\n\nYour partner was just straight up rude.", "Nta\u2026.are you sure this isn\u2019t r/entitledpeople?", "NTA, your partner is a D-bag", "NTA!

Your partner, definitely TA for his callous disregard of the helpfulness of a business employee staying well past closing when your partner asked him to do so. \n\nYour partner was, on this occasion, a self-centered jerk. Is it a red flag? Does your partner exhibit such behavior with you or others?", "Your partner is an ass", "Of course you\u2019re NTA, but your partner sure is.", "NTA. I felt guilt enough picking up a package at the post office 2 min before closing when the attendant knows me in sight. Your partner has some chutzpah.", "Your partner is a dick.", "NTA although I am not sure why your partner seems to have such a relaxed attitude towards making someone wait.", "Nta.  Your partner is an entitled asshole.", "You are my hero.\nNTA OP but do you really want to spend your life with this man who is T. A?", "NTA but your partner is without a doubt due to his selfishness about someone else's time. The mailbox attendant was already going above and beyond to assist your partner. When someone shows you exactly who they are, please believe them.", "NTA, but your partner has demonstrated huge asshole behavior here. He could have gotten the package and been home again in the amount of time he wasted on his smoothie and scrolling. \n\nAnd if you think the mailbox store employee is a disposable NPC in your life, just wait until you desperately need some extra grace or assistance from them on an urgent or time-sensitive problem. \n\nYou deserve a better partner. He deserves a lump of coal in his stocking this Christmas.", "No NTA honestly I would consider leaving my partner over something like this. Such absolute disregard for someone going out of their way to do a favor for you? That is so absurdly inconsiderate. I can\u2019t imagine this is the first time he\u2019s done something like this?
