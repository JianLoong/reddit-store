But this was years in the making. Your mother gave you a complex that you do not want your daughter to inherit. Therefore you made a very clear boundary with very clear consequences should that boundary be crossed.", "NTA. You didn't want to continue a line of abuse. Good for you, O.P.", "NTA\n\nTelling your mother not to insult and threaten your child is solid parenting.", "I do think you overreacted, but for the right reasons. Your daughter is *your* child, *not* your mother's, and how she's being raised, and with which traditions, are *your* choice.  \n\n\nSo overall, NTA. Your mother was out of line, even if threatening to completely cut off contact was maybe a bit over the top.", "NTA. I'm a Filipino so I know the custom mentioned by OP. Whenever I visit my brother's house (he has 2 kids), I would just press my hand on my nephew's and niece's forehead if they are unable to approach me (ex. sleeping). Also, a lot of people are saying that OP was overreacting, but given the trauma she went through her mom, it was understandable. A lot of Filipino kids born before 2000s or 2010s (like me) actually experienced harsh upbringing which resulted in generational trauma. It's really difficult for us, considering that our country doesn't offer a good mental health care service.", "that overreaction is fueld from experience so not really an overreaction. protect your daughter. NTA", "NTA. Sounds perfectly reasonable.", "I know mano po is important, but your mom really did need to be told that she can\u2019t say that kind of stuff to your daughter. Good on you for making it clear. Just have your daughter do mano po next time to show how unneeded mom\u2019s words are :) your daughter is young, and plenty able to learn respect without such language! NTA", "You overreacted, but NTA. I\u2019m not from the Philippines so I don\u2019t know the customs and culture. But what I do know is you and you alone have the right to teach your child what you want her to know. If it\u2019s a custom you wish your daughter to practice, then have her do so. If not, then tell your mother you don\u2019t practice that custom in your home. As for sleeping, that\u2019s also only your decision to make. You know what your child needs to be healthy.", "NTA, but you probably went a little far. My wife and I had this conversation with my MIL many years ago but more along the lines of \u201cwe are her parents and will decide what is appropriate, if you have a problem with how things are done in this house, talk to one of us.\u201d", "NTA. Filipino guy here. Some traditions fade out with generations. It's up to you if you want to carry something on or not. I still mano with my aunts and stuff even though I'm 45, as do my cousins, but I don't generally see my nieces or nephews carrying on this tradition. Correcting behavior is about teaching a child about social norms that they're expected to comply with. Based on your mom's interpretation of \"correcting behavior\" I wouldn't blame you for cutting her off from your daughter if she tries that BS again.", "100% NTA- I would have gone NC just because of this. She traumatized you in your childhood and you're being a great mom making sure she doesn't traumatize your daughter the same way.", "NTA but there's no way around it you definitely went for the nuclear option.\n\nMaybe a different approach would bare more fruit? \n\nBut you're totally within your rights to do that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
