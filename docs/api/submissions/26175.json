Also, a lot of people are saying that OP was overreacting, but given the trauma she went through her mom, it was understandable.

What should happen in the best of circumstances is a continuing discussion of what is appropriate and not appropriate, in the past, now and with mixed company of Filipinos, Americans, Asian americans, older white Americans, whomever may be in your circle etc.. so that the real and honest issue - that your child is well mannered, confident, appropriate, treats others well and is in turn accepted - is actually achieved.   \n\nIt is a shame this didn\u2019t happen in your childhood, you write that you were withdrawn and anxious as a result, but you are not your mother and maybe have more perspective and can be the bridge now.  \n\nThis is best case scenario.
