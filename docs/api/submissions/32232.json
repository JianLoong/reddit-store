If your partner has a problem with the very idea that you find another woman is attractive she has a jealousy problem.", "NTA. Seeing a lot of insecure people in these comments.

Then she is sure to see the answers and hear different perspectives", "NTA. Your GF sought out your comments. I would sort of classify this along the same lines as her being mad if she asked if she looked fat in a dress and you honestly answered that she's looked better in other outfits. She was looking to find trouble and she found it. You may think of reddit as your safe space, but it is a public forum, there was always a chance your GF would find your account/posts/comments. I would always try to avoid saying things online you wouldn't say in person, but from what you described the comments she was upset about were pretty innocuous.", "ESH\n\nsure reddit is your safe space, but if you're commenting about hot girls on it, then I don't see why your gf shouldn't be upset about that specifically. your girl friend may also be an asshole if she found your reddit profile by checking your phone.

Maybe you did accidentally slip up and she saw the name one day, honestly it changes nothing about the situation. This was a space that you kept private for a reason which is perfectly fine considering you weren't using it to betray your relationship or disparage her. If she had concerns she should have dealt with them in a healthy way and talked to you about it. Hell if the account really is as innocent as you say then you might have shown it to  her, I don't know. But what I do know is she went into a space she wasn't welcome and found nothing. If the comments really were just acknowledging that you'd hypothetically date someone in a wheelchair, and a comment from before you were together, then the fact those bother her are proof the issue lies in her own insecurities and trust issues. \n\nThe only situation I could see this going the other way is if she talked about it with you and you kept this account a secret, or lied to her about it. Maybe you would have done that and that would be a shitty thing to do tbh. But in a healthy relationship someone should be able to say \"yeah I do have a separate Reddit/insta whatever, it's really just to say dumb shit, make stupid jokes, ask embarrassing questions, vent my frustrations about people I know etc. But I'm not cheating, I'm not saying anything bad about, and I'm not betraying any of our shared ethics and values, you so you can rest easy\".

I wouldn\u2019t advise commenting on anything remotely linked to other women. It just saves you the hassle of it being vastly misinterpreted and you having to babble to explain yourself.

If so, then those issues should be addressed, but when basically making comments and/or just realizing other people exist, then no you are not the AH.\n\n  \nShe needs to think about what made her seek your safe space out and then what makes her feel so insecure about the 2 (2!) comments you made about other people.", "NTA in not feeling comfortable that your girlfriend found your Reddit and started talking to you about it without you signaling that being okay. You may have been an occasional asshole in your Reddit posts, but ye without a shitty internet post may cast the first stone on this one.\n\nYes, it's a public account. Yes, she may have seen your username over your shoulder. At the same time, this isn't \"Am I Technically Legally Allowed To Find My Boyfriend's Profile?\" it's AIT**A**.
