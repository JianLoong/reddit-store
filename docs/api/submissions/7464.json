We said yes, but only if its done professionally - an appointment is booked for 8th February, very popular salon with good reputation, meaning long wait times but if its being done its being done right. Reason for this is both her, her sister and my wife have very sensitive scalps, last time older daughter used an at home kit it went badly wrong... doctors kind of wrong.\n\nYoungest daughter was happy with this and agreed to wait, but this weekend went out with her friend and bought an at home kit, dying her hair at her friend's house without any adult assistance.\n\nWell, now it's orange.\n\nWe offered to buy a brown or black kit to cover it until her appointment, but she screamed she is a blonde, not brunette and hasn't really left her room since.\n\nShe is refusing to go to school until WE 'fix it'. I said I don't have a magic hair fixing spell, and the choice is go dark for 3 weeks or put up with the orange colour, we phoned the salon but they cannot move up the appointment, but will contact in case of a cancellation.\n\nSo reddit AITA for sending my daughter to school with self inflicted orange hair?\n\nEdit. To be clear as its been mentioned a few times, the brown/brunette option was a temporary colour, not a permanent, it'd wash out in a few weeks anyway.\n\nEdit 2: we have tried at other salons aswell, however they have similar wait times. One can fitnusnin earlier (25th jan) but honestly their Google reviews are a very mixed bag- 2 stars out of 5 so we're not overly confident with that one.\n\nEdit 3: thanks for all the responses with advice. We won't be dying it again and will try the purple/blue shampoo instead hoping to tone it down. \n\nAlso wife just got off the phone with a salon who can get her in this Friday so she'll have to suck it up for the rest of the week! It's going to costbus nearly twice as much as the normal salon, so guess who will be doing extra chores for a while...\n\nFinal edit: wife sourced silver shampoo so will be doing this shortly. Daughter emerged from her room. Apologising to us for the tantrum which we accepted and apologising for ruining her hair. We laughed, and said its her hair, not ours so she should apologise to herself, so she grabbed a mirror, stroked her hair and said a heartfelt sorry.

Your daughters hair is seriously compromised. Anything you add to it now will only make it worse. \n\nYou also need to be prepared for The Big Chop. The salon will do whatever they can to fix your daughters mistake, but 2 dyes in less than six weeks? Not good. They can try to lift it, they can try to tone it, they can try to colour correct.

Send her to school with the orange hair and give her a hat if she wants it. A few weeks living with the consequences of her actions will teach her to listen and think before acting impulsively next time - honestly, as a girl I understand that she is going to feel embarrassed about it, but a few weeks with orange hair isn't going to kill her, and with luck it'll be something she can laugh about when she's older.", "NTA, but I also wanted to second the suggestion to get a purple shampoo.

When I saw my parents, they laughed at it, told me actions had consequences, and asked if I\u2019d learnt my lesson. They found a reputable enough salon and had my hair corrected. It was a stupidly expensive bill that I spent months paying off afterwards -  COLOUR CORRECTIONS ARE SO MUCH MORE COSTLY THAN HIGHLIGHTS/HAIR COLOURINGS. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re handling it very similarly, good on you! She can deal with the consequences of her impatience and you\u2019ll get it sorted when it is possible, i.e. when there is an appointment. I wouldn\u2019t try to find something sooner, go with the reputable place.\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t cover your daughters hair with a temporary darker dye. That will make things a lot worse. On light coloured hair, even temporary dyes can permanently colour the hair and make the correction at the hairdresser\u2019s even worse. Also, ignore the recommendations to use colour removers such as colour oops - your daughter likely bleached her hair if she ended up orange and colour removers only remove dye, not bleach. Bleach can\u2019t be removed. Use a toner (blue based) or colour correcting shampoo to temporarily reduce the orange brassiness in her hair. If she were yellow, you\u2019d look for purple based products but orange needs BLUE. Lemon juice and sunlight can also be a good lightener if she wants to lighten as much as quickly as possible with minimal damage.\n\nBluntly, let her deal with the consequences. Definitely don\u2019t let her skip school out of embarrassment. She chose to rush this when a plan was already in place, she chose to try doing it with a friend rather than a qualified hairdresser. She chose to live with it rather than taking your suggestions.\n\nPersonally, I do dye and bleach at home (using professional grade products) now as I can\u2019t afford the hairdressers every 6-8 weeks, but it took years of practice to be confident in doing it myself. I have been dying my hair (originally with parents or hairdressers, but later solo) since I was 12, and it took until I was 18+ to feel comfortable using bleach without a hairdresser. And even now, I have an emergency fund to go to the salon if there\u2019s an emergency for a correction.", "Oh well, my daughter is a natural brunette. She decided to dye it black. She ended up a dark khaki green - not even all over but in patches! I found it hilarious and laughed.\n\nAnd like your daughter she had long hair. Her trying to bleach it out made it look even worse (light khaki green was not a good look). Oh well, she learnt. A temporary brown hair dye did the trick. Because her hair was now porous, the \u201ctemporary\u201d ended up almost permanent.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Those are the natural consequences for her actions.

Being a teenager means dying your hair with box dye and messing it up really badly.

Rinse for ages and repeat if needed.\n\nI lighten my daughters hair from a medium brown to light blonde, and she does this if the toner doesn't take out the brassiness enough. Leaves her hair looking like it's naturally blonde.\n\nThe less processing you can do now, the better her hair condition will be for the salon.\n\nYou're definitely NTA and neither is your daughter. \n\nWe've all been there.

At least it's only for school and not a job.", "NTA, you\u2019re doing great, love the updates, and please forgive me for having a tiny laugh to myself about your daughter\u2019s predicament!  \ud83d\ude00 \n\nShe definitely screwed up, but it\u2019s like the least dangerous, least scary version of \u201cteenager does a dumb thing\u201d and the consequences are purely ego-based and super temporary.

You guys seem like great parents, you've gone above and beyond (many wouldn't even have booked her the initial appt let alone gone to the lengths you did to secure and provide alternatives) and she has apologised for being immature (she is only young still after all!).

Sounds like your daughter just learned her first \u201cfuck around and find out\u201d lesson.", "I did this. Bleached my hair, dyed it, and absolutely hated the color it became.  \n\nNTA OP, this is a right of passage \ud83e\udd23, she's lucky it's just orange, rather than swamp green (10/10 don't recommend, got called Shrek hair for a year, even after dying it back to my natural color).\n\nI would maybe sit her down and explain how her body constantly changes, and how some things should just be left to the pros. Your daughter doesn't sound entitled per say. But that hissy fit will not be cured by you booking her a sooner appointment.  Make her go to school so she doesn't get behind, and explain to her that she did it to herself, and that she needs to learn the lesson for it. You have a wonderful opportunity to give her a really good prospective for when she's an adult, please don't just pass it up by giving her what she wants and not addressing that tantrum.", ">Final edit: wife sourced silver shampoo so will be doing this shortly. Daughter emerged from her room. Apologising to us for the tantrum which we accepted and apologising for ruining her hair. We laughed, and said its her hair, not ours so she should apologise to herself, so she grabbed a mirror, stroked her hair and said a heartfelt sorry. So all seems to be right in the world again.\n\nSounds like this has resolved itself haha.\n\nSome advice for general hair mess ups. Don\u2019t try to have her dye another box she over her messed up orange hair. Beleive when I say it can be worse than just orange (try a nasty dark orange green that\u2019s the color of an upset stomach) and it will make it SO much harder for the hair dresser to pull the color out. It will likely force them to have to damage her hair more than they would\u2019ve or at worst, chop it off and or meter out appointments to prevent damage \u2014prolonging her bad hair fix.\n\nIn the future in case of a mess up try going to a Sally\u2019s with good ratings. Most people who were there are in cosmetology school and have played around (and messed up) their hair ALOT. If you the person who helps you seems hesitant ask for someone with more experience in your issue. If they can produce someone go to another one. Maybe ask for a manager, all my managers were hair dressers/ nail techs, extension artists on the side and new so so much.\n\nI could give you some blanket advice about toners, dawn dish soap, etc but honestly without knowing EXACTLY what product she used, and seeing a before and after of her hair and understanding more about her hair, there\u2019s a good chance i could recommend the wrong thing. Purple shampoo is one of the few things that probably won\u2019t do any \u201creal\u201d damage. It\u2019s probably going to turn it silver though, so be prepared for that.\n\nAnother fairly harmless recommendation. Have your daughter cut off a test strip from some unnoticeable spot. Wash and rinse it multiple times with dawn dish soap. See if it pulls the color out or if it just goes green. Dawn will strip just about anything, and while it\u2019s not great for hair a good conditioning mask or a few should be enough to repair the dryness. Since it\u2019s a temp color it may pull it out pretty easily.", "NTA.

I've been platinum blonde all my childhood and as an adult my hair is naturally a dark blonde, a level 8 blonde. I went \"natural\" once and it was absolutely the worst, I felt like I lost my identity. Spent a miserable 4 weeks with a darker hue until I could get into the salon. Was it absolutely stupid to be so upset about a darker shade on my head, absolutely,  but it was  part of who I was. Maybe try a hair color app for your daughter before taking the plunge on the dye. She might be excited now about brown hair but may end up regretting it after it's done (and speaking from experience it's much healthier for hair and cheaper to foil and tone hair than it is to color remove and bleach to go back to blonde).", "NTA", "NTA\nYou told your daughter to wait until she can get it done professionally.

Because lightening hair is a two-step process.  First remove the old color, then add in the new.  Trying to put blonde hair dye will just partially remove the natural brown color, leaving it orange.", "There's a lot of misinformation here about what you should do to temporarily fix this. I agree you need to let a professional handle it, but 1. She'd need to use blue shampoo and conditioner, not purple. Think of a color wheel. You need to opposite color to tone it down. If your hair is yellow, you use purple. If it's orange, you use blue. Secondly, that's a very light temporary solution. I don't recommend it because I can't see how much damage has already been done or how even the dye job is, but what happened is your daughter left off a step in her process. If you're going to lighten at home (I don't recommend it at her age, those of us that are fairly good at it have been doing it for years), then you need to remember this process for lightening hair: lighten, tone, condition. She lightened it, but all that does is strip the pigment from her hair. That's why it's orange. She SHOULD have followed that dye/bleach with a toner, which would've taken it from orange to whatever shade of blonde she was going for (there are different shades of toners- wheat, champagne, beige, platinum, etc.) Then she should've had a deep conditioning treatment on hand to apply afterwards.", "NTA Yeah it was her own mistake. Happens most of us though.

I then made the mistake of trying to go back to blonde and ended up green, but from dying it twice so quick I couldn't do a third so I got stuck there for a while lol", "Why not both? If she likes being blonde, we have the technology. Nothing wrong with that.", "Lol sounds like your daughter picked up a little bit of that stubbornness.", "light blue and pink hair is sooo pretty ngl. ofc, it's not great if that isn't what you were expecting \ud83d\ude02 but hey, i've cut my hair on my own and worn beanies and snapbacks for a full YEAR before i got it fixed. i recently dyed half my hair green and it was great, got it redone and the front of my hair didn't take so i had half black (natural color), most of the other half green, and the front a weird orange color. i just said fk it and haven't done anything about it bc at 21 i just don't care if others hate it", "Sounds like now's the time to break out the old photos, and also to give her Anne of Green Gables to read.", "She thought that you just put it on your hair and it came out blue. Lol !", "I'm dying!! Thanks for sharing that :-)", "Lol hey did you know from the mountain of replies that all dark hair turns orange?\n\nAlso, when I was 16 I used sun-in in my dirty blonde hair (yay the 90s) and it was not a good look. \n\nOP, NTA. There are many, many of us who\u2019ve learned the lesson your daughter learned lol", "I had the exact same experience. My hair is pretty light brown, but, like you said, you can't lift it with just one kit.  When we were freshmen in college (so not even that young) we died our hair in the dorm showers and both ended up with horrible orange hair.", "Whoopsie!\nFortunately I was 22 and engaged, so it didn't really matter to me what my classmates/professors thought.", "Read my other comments.\n\nNot going to explain it again.\n\nSuddenly everyone is an expert on my hair colour...", "I had platinum blonde hair and dyed it brown twice with no issue. Well except that it was meant to be wash out but apparently my hair holds on to colour and I had to wait for it to grow out with weird blonde regrowth.", "Also not allowed unless it's religious.", "We say \u201dhighway grey blonde\u201d in Finland for this same shade :D", "Maybe \u201cliving\u201d wasn\u2019t the correct term but there\u2019s loads of women that regret damaging their hair.", "that or she's just that scared of turning into a brunette\nand honestly, as a brunette myself, rude!", "Counter act this by getting a henna tattoo/tattoo pen kit first.", "Lol. I learned this the hard way. I'd dyed my hair fun neon colors all the way through high school. Green, blue, purple, red, you name it. Then I covered it all with black. Actually turned into a navy blue which I thought was cool so I left it.\n\nAnyway, I went to bleach my whole head for a new color as I'd done many many many times in the past. Except it felt like every single color I'd ever used decided to show up. My hair was a wild rainbow colors. And not the pretty, purposeful kind.\n\n...i had to go in for a full color correction at a salon and have never touched bleach again and will not as long as I live.", "I just think if you never noticed your hair was \"red\" until you dyed/bleached it and it went orange, and now you believe you're secretly a redhead whose hair just naturally looks a different colour, then your hair probably isn't \"really\" red. Lot of people here fooling themselves because they like the idea of being redheads I think.", "I went from golden blond as a young child to chestnut brown at around age 6. Way before puberty. Same with my brother. My hairdresser I started using in college didn\u2019t even believe it until she saw old pictures of me.", "I think lighting makes a huge difference. People say my dark blond hair is brunette and I\u2019m a 6/7 at the stylist. In dark lighting the hair does look brunette but if you put me in natural or brighter lighting it looks much more blond although still dirty or ashy blond.\n\nMy sister has lighter brunette hair and her hair does not shift so dramatically in different lightings like mine does. We have different fathers and a red headed mother so we don\u2019t have the same colored hair. My dad is blond and her dad has black hair, and we are dark blond and brunette respectively.\n\nI\u2019m fully highlighted at the moment so I\u2019m very blond right now but even this hair looks different colors depending on the light. Sometimes I look gray cause it\u2019s very white blond at the moment.\n\nBlond hair just works this way I think. People just think we are sensitive and want to pretend to be blond so that\u2019s why you feel like the mirror is lying to you. \n\nPeople get so mean about me saying my hair is dark blond when it is and that I\u2019m just afraid to be brunette.\n\nI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m brunette. I color my dark blond hair to be lighter anyway and that wouldn\u2019t change that I like to go lighter cause I just like the look and it suits me. \n\nWhat bothers me is that other people are so stubborn that they suddenly become experts on what is blond and brunette when I\u2019ve gone to a stylist for 20 years and she says I\u2019m dark blond and has held my hair up in front of me next to the color chart.\n\nShe\u2019s the expert lol. I trust her saying I\u2019m a dirty blond over someone inexperienced saying I have brunette hair.\n\nEdit: I was second guessing myself so I messaged my stylist to see and I was wrong - I'm actually a level 8. And people STILL insist I'm brunette and will hear nothing of me being a dark blond.", "Yeah the only reason I would bleach it is to have some fun color like blue or purple", "Oh I did, but don't ever discount the resourcefulness of a teenage girl with birthday money and a rebellious spirit.", "Honestly discovering toner was like learning magic, it fixes almost everything! Like in OPs daughters case, I would def recommend putting on a toner just to take the edge off the orange rather than going over it with dark box dye; it might take patchy, or go a greeny mucky colour, and be even harder to fix at the salon.", "I'm exactly the same, but when my hair went gray, it got curlier (like beach waves, but some ringlets).\n\nThat was a surprise. Hormones are weird.", "I had no idea that coloring hair was so complicated!", "Interesting! I'm just white on all sides (all Italian, German, and a tiny bit of Irish ancestry), but there is no blonde anywhere that I know of elsewhere in my family. Lots of redheads on the German side, but no blondes. So that was a bit of a surprise for my parents when my hair grew in blonde! Genetics are odd.", "Make it 3 of us! I was born with a head full of black hair then by the time I was 2, it'd changed to blonde (never fell out, just changed colors). From the time I was about 2 to 13, it slowly darkened. Also, around the time I was 13, my hair decided it didn't want to be mostly straight with a slight wave. Instead it wanted to be super wavy to the point of almost being considered curly.", "A woman I work with was curly as a kid, went straight at puberty and then curly again at menopause. So I am really curious to see if I go curly again as I get older. Currently when it's past my shoulders and I don't comb it, I have beach waves. But I had ringlets before puberty and still miss them. I don't miss the blonde because I don't remember it at all.", "Its chemistry, knowing how the chemicals effect the hair to get your desired result. Its also art, you have to know what colors cancel each other out, clash, or compliment, and placement to get everyone their desired outcome. And some outcomes are unrealistic. I make most of my money on color corrections because it takes so much time to fix what people tried to attempt at home because they watched a few Brad mondo videos and think they can skip the science and color theory behind doing hair.", "Mine did dramatic colour changes too! Born with really dark brown hair, turned light golden blonde as a toddler/ little kid with super light sunbleached ends, went dark blonde/light brown by 12, dyed it black for ages so never saw the colour much until around mid 20\u2019s when I decided to grow it out because the difference between my black box dye and the roots was sometimes not even that noticeable indoors.\nTurns out it was a super dark reddish brown naturally once I grew all the dye out, then when I got pregnant it went a whole level darker to the point of looking actually black when I wear it in an updo indoors (the ends still sun bleach out to a dark dark auburnish red brown shade but if it\u2019s bunned with the sun bleaching tucked away it looks uniformly a warm ish \u201cclosest brown you can get to being jet black\u201d with a sprinkle of silvers now at the front)", "Yeah, if I use curly hair products and scrunch a bit, it's much curlier, beach waves if I just use conditioner and air dry.\n\nMy hair is mostly light blonde now (chemically) and color hasn't affected the curl pattern at all. \n\nIt's certainly easy to style! I probably blow it out straight once a month for a temporary change."]}
