Because if they aren't holding money/housing over your head you're going to want to practice saying, \"No!\", and meaning it. They can pressure you to do things, just keep repeating, \"My 'no' is a complete answer.\"  You're old enough to decide where you want to go.", "Totally NTA. He broke your trust in a major way. Also your folks shouldn't have forced you to go if you didn't want to.", "Easily NTA. He cheated, which he shouldn't have done. As well as your parents forced you to go.

Your parents need to remember that (regardless of the circumstances of the death) not everyone cries at a funeral. More than that they should be apologising to you for forcing you to attend the funeral of someone who hurt you so badly.", "Definitely NTA. And call it an educated guess, but it sounds like they cared more about saving face than your personal feelings.", "NTA - As Buddhists, one would think you being Zen throughout such a 'rough' ordeal would have been a good thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
