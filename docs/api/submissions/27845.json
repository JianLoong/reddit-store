We usually get along but lately my dad's been on some conspiracy theory vibes and while some of his arguments have some sense to them, others seem to come out of left field, but I usually take it in stride. That brings us to last night/ this morning. At 2am, my dad saw through our ring cam that a stranger came up to our door with two kittens in a cat carrier and left them on the step. When I woke up around 9am they were still out there. I was told by my cousin, who also lives there, that my dad had said to leave the kittens out there until the shelter comes to pick them up. The problem is the shelter doesn't open until like 11am/12pm. It was still really cool in the morning and the kittens were shivering, but still alive. They looked about six weeks old. I started worrying and didn't understand why my dad just left them out there. So I grabbed a towel and set it on a chair and brought the kittens inside to wait for the shelter. When my dad woke up this morning to get ready for his doctor's appointment, he heard the kittens and became mad. He yelled at me to put them back outside and that the stranger who dropped them off probably laced the bag with something, like anthrax or some other poison in an attempt to expose and kill our whole family with it....What?\n\nI told him that he was being paranoid and that the kittens had simply been abandoned and that the fact they survived the cold was amazing. I didn't see the harm in letting them inside to warm up and wait for the shelter to come get them. He then told me I'd be the person in a zombie apocalypse that would have been responsible for killing her whole family.\n\nI told him that if that was the case wouldn't the kittens be showing signs of poisoning already since they were out there for hours? And that I wasn't going to risk the kittens because of some random wild theory that he's pulling from air. It made no logical sense to me that anyone, let alone a stranger, would go through the trouble of getting their hands on some anthrax, a mesh kitten carrier, and two kittens, just to poison a random family. He made me put them outside again and I went to my room angry as hell. I heard him move around for a moment and then open the front door. He texted me that he brought them back in and asked me to wait with them until the shelter comes.\n\nI feel like I'm in the right but even my mom is on his side. So now I'm wondering if I actually did put my family at risk just to save two kittens from the cold as they probably would have been fine until the shelter came. I just felt so bad leaving them out there.

Is there someone you can talk to about him? People who have his kind of mentality typically only get worse unless they get some kind of help. If there isn't anyone who can help him, you should probably start preparing now to leave in the next couple of years, assuming it gets worse. I only say this because it sounds like your mother may enable him. Start finding ways to save money that your parents can't access. Hopefully he gets better, but be prepared, in case he doesn't.", "No, NTA.

You saved their lives, and I don\u2019t think you put anybody lives at risk.", "Not at all", "NTA he is damned lucky the kittens didn't die! If there was a poison in there that affects people it would have killed the cats. His behavior is frankly, disturbing. Growing up I was friends with two girls whose father was 'a little off' and into conspiracy theories. It got so bad they had to call the police on him when he basically took the family hostage. I don't see how old you are but do you have a safe adult you can talk to about this? At the very least start preping for leaving in the future.

I'm glad you (throughout) and he had kindness on the kittens in the end though.", "ESH, you for taking the kittens in, your dad for thinking anthrax.\n\nI think it's really weird that someone abandoned kittens at your front step; usually it's by a pet store, animal shelter, rescue office not a persons house unless they do kitten or whatever specific animal, rescue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People who are clinically paranoid like your father won't listen to your arguments. To them, what they think is true is very real, it's their 'reality' for a lot of reasons they will never tell you. If you want a comparison, it's the same for Alzheimer patients who have forgotten a part of their past. If you tell them that they are married with kids but they don't remember even having been going out with anyone, whatever you say, they won't believe you.\nAnother example, it's the same with people who have sleep paralysis and see, feel, hearor even smell things that aren't there, that don't exist. Most of the time they think they have gone crazy but in fact they are just ill and they could get treatments but they can't open up to anyone because they are ashamed of maybe being crazy.\nSo they prefer to believe that for example there is a ghost in their room, or they have been abducted by aliens because it is what they think they have experienced and it's better to take refuge into fantasy or conspiracy, than to admit you need help.\n\nAnd help is what your father needs. Professional help. Professionals know to never contradict an  Alzheimer patients, but divert the conversation so that the situation doesn't escalate. Your father is a family member, there's no way you can stay neutral with him.\nStop to engage with him and try to get help from the rest of your family.", "NTA. Your parents are whackjobs and you need get the hell out of there before they turn on you.", "NTA. Anthrax in a kitten carrier sounds like an incredibly odd way to try to poison someone. The kittens would definitely have shown signs of sickness and there\u2019s no guarantee it would spread to the humans.", "NTA. You are a good and kind human being to take care of those poor, abandoned kittens. The asshole is the person who left them on your doorstep. Your parents are nutcases. \n\nKeep on being a decent human being. We need more of you.", "He's not getting worse. It's not something super prevalent, but every six to eight  months or so he'll bring up some type of idea that sounds either conspiracy like or something that's a little weird but has decent arguments for and very rarely he comes out of left field like this. His last big conspiracy theory was about covid vaccines. My mom is going with the flow and likes to keep the peace but also admits that as the world outside gets worse, she's become a little bit more paranoid, so that's why she agreed with my dad on taking the precaution.", "I'm actually 31. I live with my parents for a multitude of reasons, the biggest reason is paying them rent is much more affordable than any apartments. I do want to live on my own one day, but not because of things like this. More so because I'd like to just have my own spot to myself, but it's just no realistically possible for me at this time.", "I'm 31, he's not a dangerous man, he just gets way out there with his theories. This is the first argument we've had in years, and he didn't do anything rash, we just yelled at each other. Once we both calmed down and spoke again he apologized for the things he said and told me he understood where I was coming from. He said he's just seen things like this happen before in his news stories, and despite them being rare cases he always thinks worst case scenario when something shady: Like a stranger quickly dropping off a kitten carrier at your door and leaving, happens. While I disagree with his theory on the possibility of worst intentions in this case I can understand why he worries.", "Okay, he's not abusive. My mom legitimately agrees with him. She even admitted when they came home that she's gotten more paranoid lately because of all the bad things that happen in the world. Although she didn't think poison or anthrax. Her worry was them setting up a camera or something in the carrier to potentially case the house.", "I have one small dog.", "We actually talked it out later when he and I both calmed down. He sees my side of things and basically agreed to disagree. He said in the moment when he got angry he was only thinking of the worst case scenarios because he is a worrier at heart and he's seen crazier things happen so he doesnt trust how shady the drop off was. He said he does understand where I am coming from though.", "It's been 31 years, if they were going to turn on me, they would have done it already, lol. They're just old and worry a lot about what's happening in the world. It was a bad argument but the only one in like years. We already talked through it. He apologized for being cruel to me. He thinks the worst case scenarios in things sometimes and he admitted that to me. We agreed to disagree and he says he understands my side and shouldn't have said the things he said to me.", "Thank you for looking after the kittens. Kittens can go downhill very fast.   \nYour father has some issues to be sure. If he had been concerned about someone trying to get you to open the door because they claim to have found kittens or something, then he would have a point. Believing someone laced a cat carrier with poison is next level nuts and doesn\u2019t even make sense.   NTA", "Sorry I had to be the first one to tell you that it's abuse but this issue isn't unique to you. Tell your therapist all this, including your life of denial, when you're out of the house and trying to figure out why your brain isn't behaving like a well adjusted adult.", "In that case you're in the wrong. Just saying you shouldn't bring strange animals in your home because you're risking passing viruses to your animals", "Can you tell me how so?", "if the animals in the home are up to date on their vaccinations and are kept away from the strays there's very little risk of infection or contamination", "I should add I put them on a high chair near the door where my dog cannot reach. He perked up at the sound of their cries but otherwise didn't get near the carrier.", "Dogs and cats aren't the same species.\n\nIt looks like the only real risk was the potential for kennel cough, which isn't debilitating and the dog would get over.\n\nAnd as the name suggests, it's really only found in kennels and shelters... it's vastly unlikely the kittens were sick with that. Or anything, really. Kittens often have cat herpes but that isn't passed to dogs.\n\nThis is quite unlikely and not worth calling someone an asshole over. No they weren't in the wrong.", "How is the yelling and the berating and the verbal abuse based on his psychosis abusive? Babe if you don't see I do not have the degree to make you understand. You need professional help if you think what he's being allowed to do is at all okay or normal.", "He is, although he's due for his next vaccination next month, so I don't know if that makes him more susceptible being that he'll need his update soon.", "The most common contamination would be from parasites such as tapeworms and roundworms. \n\nAs a pet owner I can tell you once a pet is dewormed doesn't mean they can't get it again.", "Actually the most common risk is transfer of parasites like tape and round worms. Which is very common for kittens and strays.   \n\nSo not that unlikely and I would still say yup in the wrong", "I mean, it was an argument. I yelled just as much and said bad things to him as well. We both talked it out after calming down and apologized for the rude things we said to each other, him more than me actually. No excuses, we did end up to agree to disagree and he apologized for being cruel. Also, this is the first argument we had in literally years and the first and only time he said something that made me upset. Arguments do not equal abuse. Verbal insults can constitute as abusive, especially if it's a pattern, but this isnt it. You said it yourself, you do not have a degree. And this one argument is not a blue print for how the rest of the living situation is all year round. I understand your concerns and I thank you for having them, but understand that reading one post does not mean you understand or know anything about my life beyond this one argument.", "you should be in the clear, but if you're concerned, which is fair, you can sterilize the area the kittens touched with Lysol and then bathe the dog.", "Yeah, but you said viruses. You must have just googled it.\n\nNo, the dog isn't going to get worms from kittens that are inside a crate and up where the dog can't reach them in particular.\n\nWorms aren't viruses, and worms are treatable with deworming medicine.", "the CDC says exposure is unlikely to happen outside of fecal matter. in all likelihood, OP is fine. making sure to clean up afterward is important but as long as the animals are kept separate they're fine. i actually asked my vet about this bc i was curious.", "round worms are transferred through fecal matter. the animals are separate so OP is good there. tape worms are transferred through ingesting flea eggs. OP needs to vacuum and clean the area thoroughly, but that's just common sense. yea, NTA.", "If you wanna play semantics you're the one who said the only risk is kennel cough. You didn't use the word virus you used risk.  So I guess you didn't Google it . \n\nAlso just because something is treatable doesn't make it something not to worry about. Heck the cost alone is something to make you not want to risk it", "Yes, because I was replying to you talking about viruses.\n\nWhy do I need quote you or else my argument is suddenly invalid?\n\nHave you ever heard about \"moving the goal posts\"? You might want to google it. You acted like viruses were a risk, but they aren't really.\n\nIt's such a dumb hill to die on. Do you not own pets? Have you ever taken care of an animal before? In general dewormer is cheap. Not everything needs a $500 vet bill or something. \n\nAnd life is never free of risks completely. I take care of feral cats and kittens in my spare time. I deworm them myself. It's extremely easy. I'm not going to leave a kitten in the cold for the extremely extremely rare risk anything is going to happen to my dogs.", "Eh I'll be honest stop reading after the first line. I really don't care lol let's agree to disagree.  Have a great rest of your day"]}
