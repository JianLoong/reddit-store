I waited a while and passing by the bathroom every time I would see she still didn't clean it up! \nI don't understand how there could have been water there on the floor right by the toilet when there isn't even a sink (it's a half bath) in that room. \nAt some point I got real bitter and I said to her, \"laura, i see there's some liquid on the floor, would you mind cleaning that up please!?\" \n\nAnd she looked st me with such surprise and dismay like what am I talking about?? \nShe said some small rebuttal that I don't remember but I insisted and said there was no liquid there in the bathroom before!  And that muttered I don't feel comfortable cleaning after her son .... \n\nSo she begrudgingly went and cleaned it up. \n\nThe atmosphere was rather tense thereafter. \n\nI'm wondering AITA for saying something??am I being a d*ck for not just shutting my mouth and cleaning it myself?? I don't know. I don't know what I should have done in that situation and for the future, if something like this happens again. \n\n*EDIT:* as many of you have already said, she may not have noticed that there was a spillage on the floor. And I thought of that too, that's why I asked her beforehand if she saw it before? And she didn't. I'm not holding that against her at all! And I understand.  It was just that she seemed so begrudged to even be asked and why I'm making a big deal of it! That kinda pissed me off a bit. \n\nBut overall I felt I was the arsehole for even asking.", "created_utc": 1685721034, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yge6z/aita_for_expecting_my_friend_to_clean_after_her/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People should clean up after their children. It\u2019s odd that she would expect you to clean up her child\u2019s urine.", "NTA. She should clean up after her child if he made a mess. Basic guest manners.", "NTA, while it's completely possible she missed it cause kids are tornados that can't stop until they pass out. You shouldn't have to clean up after his bodily fluids.", "A hard one, if you pick cleaning it yourself you will have the right to ban her and her spawn from your house. But by asking her to clean, gets ankward but they get to keep comming.\r  \n\r  \nNTA, unless you are doing both.", "NTA. She shouldn't have to be asked. She shouldn't even leave the room before cleaning it up. I cannot imagine what would possess someone to be a guest in someone else's home, watch their child piss on the bathroom floor, and just leave it there. Fucking gross.\n\nEdit: ok as others pointed out maybe she didn't notice? I guess benefit of the doubt. Still though, yeah, she can clean her own kid's piss up.", "NTA\n\nI find it unfathomable that she wouldn\u2019t have cleaned it herself. That seems like it should be an instinctive response to finding out there\u2019s liquid on the floor that even just MIGHT be your kid\u2019s pee. Even if it\u2019s water, they must have made the mess somehow.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure she was embarrassed but frankly that shit happens as a parent. As the guest, you just have to apologize and ask for the necessary cleaning supplies to get it taken care of if you don\u2019t already have sufficient stuff in a bag planning for exactly this type of occurrence. She needed to get over herself and just handle it. It\u2019s even more embarrassing for her that she expected you to take care of that.", "100% NTA. I\u2019m a single mom and while I definitely deserve a break, I\u2019m not going to LEAVE PEE ON THE FLOOR of my childless friend\u2019s bathroom and bitch about having to clean it up. That\u2019s nonsense. And guess what? That\u2019s the f\u2018ing job and I signed up for it.", "NTA, but you could have been less passive-aggressive about it. The way you said it, it could come off to your friend as asking her to clean up your mess, because she may not have been aware that \"the liquid\" was her kid's pee.", "NTA you clean up after yourself and your young children and/or pets.", "> I actually came back into the bathroom, because they ran out of toilet paper. I think that at this point I saw a puddle on the floor as she got him dressed up again.\n>\n> I said nothing and we continued hanging. \n\nINFO: How long after the incident did you wait to say something?\n\nTo me it's weird that you saw this and didn't say something, and then you repeatedly walked past the bathroom after they had already left and still didn't say something. When you walked in and saw the puddle you could have said \"Oh it looks like your son had an accident, lemme give you some paper towels to clean that up\" and that would have avoided this entire situation.", "NTA\nBut I would probably have just cleaned it myself.", "NAH - You thought she caused the mess, she probably thought you did. \nNo assholes here but maybe a \u201cdid you cause that mess?\u201d would have showed her that you thought it was her. And that you weren\u2019t asking her to clean it for no reason.", "NTA but maybe she did not see it and think it is something else and cone not from her child?", "ESH is my vote. She should have cleaned agreeably; you could wad up paper towels and wipe it up yourself with no risk to your health.", "Yta. You should have helped her out and cleaned it up. She\u2019s a mom and is definitely overworked and busy. She is most certainly exhausted from the kids. Help out more, it benefits you and your friend.\u263a\ufe0f", "NTA. She knew it was from her son but didn't want to clean it herself", "NTA for not wanting to clean another kid's accident/spillage.\n\nBut I'm more baffled that there are bathrooms without sinks? Ew? I was under the impression that a half bath meant a bathroom meant a room with a toilet and sink but no shower or tub", "Yikes, NTA. Don't invite her back over either, she does not respect your household at all. Sounds like she is a little self-centered to me.", "I wouldn't have called it liquid (because she used not knowing about it as an excuse). I would have said \"can you please take a moment to clean up your child's urine in the bathroom?\"", "Right?? Thank you!!", "Yes. I agree. Very possible indeed.", "Lol your reply made me chuckle, the thing though she is my best friend and I do love her, but I'm just (please don't kill me readit) I'm not the most.... kid loving out there. I am happily childfree and am planning on keeping it that way (with my partner) so... I guess there is that. It did kinda bug me and as much as I wanted to host her and her child, and make them feel welcome, I just couldn't muster it in me to start wiping whatever liquid it was!! \nBut I do still want her to come! Lol, with her little spawn that needed her attention at all time!! \nAnd tbh, it really took everything in me to tell her that! Sh%t like that just explodes my anxiety!  I hate having to confront something like this but at the same breath I refuse to clean up after other's sh%t! No pun intended.", "Thank you! That's how I felt!! And if the tables were reversed, I wouldn't have waited for my friend to mention something I would have cleaned it up! \n\nP.s. our standards of cleanliness are a bit different, she's more boho alternative, pot plants around the house and organic flaxseed and oats, mess all the time all around the house and clutter, while, I'm a bit more.... mainstream?  (Not trying to shame her, I love her dearly, just context)", "Yes I understand.... so how could I make it better?? \nIt's really hard for me not to sound sometimes passive aggressive. Even when I'm trying!! I'm just all up inside trying to bottle up my frustrations and shock and dismay and I try to say it in the most polite way, even trying to control how I'm saying that but still upset inside. That's the internal conflict within me. \nPlease believe, it was *extremely* hard for me to say that! I find it really hard to speak out on such things - to people who I care about but are not as close as family! Because it could be seen as embarrassing or confrontational!", "Omg right?? I don't remember when exactly or where, but I think I was working waiting tables many tears ago and some pisshead just left his dogs piss on the ground at the middle of the cafe, stood there talking to someone and did nothing!!! I waited still nothing!!  When they started walking away, I got out with the mop and said to him \"you're welcome\" he huffed like it was expected of us to just clean it!! Damn!!", "Ermm a while, like 10 15 mins? \n\nHmm yes ok. I hear you. I just didn't know what to do at first, I was embarrassed to say anything...anything  and was hoping she'd catch on! Then was afraid of saying something!  Then needed to come up with the words steaming in my head and how to come across nice and polite!! You see? \n\nBut I appreciate your input! And will take it on board in the future!  Thanks.", "Ok, I was trying to summarise it up a bit.\nBut in actuality, I did actually ask her if she remembered having water there on the floor before they came into the bathroom, and she said \"I don't know, I don't think so... I didn't look\" so then I said, \"I'm sorry I don't think there was any water there before, do you think your child might have missed?\" And then I asked her to please clean it. She said to me it's just water. And I insisted that there was no water beforehand, so whatever it is, .... and I tail ended that sentence.", "Yes I completely understand, it's totally possible to not see it when you stand above it and no reflection.  And I thought in hindsight maybe that's what it was, for her. \nBut nonetheless, there was no water there before!  \nAnd I really contemplated hard in my head of if there was or wasn't there before, until I realized that there wasn't and there's no other explanation.  \n\nOk I feel like I'm making too much of a big deal about\nThis. It's done now.", "I why should clean some child's piss!", "Sorry, but no. The adult with the child can clean up after their child. That really isn't much to ask for.", "Nope. If your kid pees on the floor, it is your responsibility to clean it up. Period.\n\nAnd yes. I am a parent.", "Oh absolutely not. You are responsible for your own bodily fluids and that of your young offspring.", "No. No no no no no. Moms aren\u2019t special because \u201ewe need a break\u201c. Read the room, man. Everyone needs a damn break. Parenthood (at least 4 years ago when this baby was born) is voluntary. Her friend had the nerve to not only not clean it up, but to hope it would go unnoticed. \n\nIf I need a break, I find a willing participant to help me and I would NEVER put this on an unsuspecting friend. \n\nThis entitlement is gross and gives all us moms a bad name. And honestly, you sound like that mom who thinks she\u2019s special and deserves to cut in front of everyone at Starbucks. Back of line for you.", "I love kids and I only clean up bodily fluids when getting paid OR in an emergency situation. When your kid pees, it\u2019s your job to clean it up. NTA OP", "Yeah I\u2019m fully with you here. I\u2019m also child free and benefit #8036 is you don\u2019t have to clean up someone else\u2019s bodily fluids!\n\nLike I\u2019d do it if they were overwhelmed and asked or in a crisis or something but yeah if you\u2019re as capable as me of wiping up a pee puddle, I\u2019m definitely not doing it.", "Most people are pretty understanding if you're straight with them. In this case, you could have said something like, \"Hey, I noticed a puddle on the ground after your son went pee in the bathroom,and no one else has been in there all day. I understand it's sometimes difficult for kids that young to avoid making a mess. Would you mind helping me clean it up?\" A reasonable person would respond \"oh yes, sorry about that .Let me help.\" If your friend isn't amenable to that or says something mean in response, then they're the AH, and if that happens, I would recommend just letting it go and then taking note of it when inviting them over the next time.

Screw them, it's still your mum, if they care about you then they shouldn't disrespect what you respect. \nIt's ESH because she should have cleaned it, and you could have just cleaned it, you didn't need to make this into another great chance to underline the fact that you don't want kids.", "YTA peeing is natural", "In the uk, it will often be just a toilet.

It's seems to imply that not only didn't she clean it up, but she willingly ignored it.  \n\n\nWrangling a small child is no easy feat, especially one that you are potty training.  Perhaps she didn't notice the little puddle on the floor.  You mention walking back and forth and seeing it numerous times.  Would it have been so difficult to grab some paper towels and just toss them over the puddle during one of these trips?    \n\n\nIt's just silly that you'd stand on this with a friend instead of being a little bit more patient, supportive and kind.  \n\n\nI just wait for the day when you are a bit infirm and do something unseemly in public and someone rushes over to scold you for your bad manners.
