I didn't want to deal with her showing off to the entire family in front of me so I told her I won't be coming. She asked why so I told her that I didn't want to deal with her friends and our family.

Why did I always have to do better. Why couldn't I just fail for once. \nI'm going to tell you what I told my sibling. I told them that they were not the main character of my life.  I got top grades for me. So I could get into the college I wanted to go to. So I could shape my life the way I wanted it to go. I didn't make teachers be shitty to them.

You're obviously jealous of your sister. She shares milestones with loved ones, and most of us do that.

The way you describe your sister it doesn't sound like she's showing off but that she genuinly wants to share her milestones with loved ones - and that includes you! It's very likely that the only one that's strictly comparing the two of you are you. Because no where in your post do you say that the others compare the two of you. When she made her announcement on the test result your family (after congratulating her) turned to you and asked for your result. Probably because they genuinly care for you and are interested in how you did.\n\nThe gender reveal party sounds like an excuse to have a family gathering and just have fun (your sister even said it would be fun). If your family knows about your pregnancy they will most likely ask questions about the gender of your baby too. Which means that your sister is more than happy to share the spotlight with you, otherwise she wouldn't insist on you coming. You're pregnant together. You live close to each other. Your sister wants to spend time with you. Enjoy it! You can have so much fun together and share both the happy times and the hard times together. So please!

How not a single person has noticed is completely wild to me. My brother and I fight like cats and dogs but if something is bothering him I can sense it as soon as I see him.", "Nothing in her post indicates that anyone except OP was comparing her and her sister.  Nothing in her post was indicative of her sister being a \"golden child\".  She never even addresses how her parents treated either of them, growing up or now, which is the central element in the golden child/scapegoat dynamic .  The parents are the ones who would have been making the comparisons or making OP the scapegoat.  There is none of that in this post, just a lot of examples showing how envious she is of her sister's successes and how she believes that her sister was \"showing off\" and \"seeking attention\".", "If someone constantly gets lower grades than their sibling, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to realise you shouldnt ask them their grades in front of their sibling. \n\nIf you are that person's *parent* then it shouldnt take you nearly as long to realise the grade is not going to be higher than the sibling or as high as the sibling and you need to *stop asking when the sibling is around*\n\nIf they had a grade they were proud of they would announce it.", "If you\u2019re any kind of parent you see how your kids are doing and if you know they\u2019re struggling you don\u2019t make them fess up over and over in front of people after hearing how great the other is doing. If your child struggles in school you ask them privately how things are going, you get involved, you help them. You don\u2019t ask them in front of people how their  grades are.", "If one kid says they\u2019re doing good in their subject I ask the other kid how it\u2019s going in the class they excel at. It\u2019s pretty simple, you concentrate on their strengths and quietly help them with their weaker subjects.", "She simply doesn\u2019t want to go! Why is that so hard to grasp? She knows she\u2019s going to feel horribly at this party and she\u2019s trying to avoid that. The sister needs to learn to take no as an answer. No is a complete sentence.", "> But what is considered girly in western culture today has nothing to do with anything intrinsic in women. It is social conditioning and marketing.\n\nDid I say otherwise?\n\n> Heels and the color pink were both for men originally.\n\nI didn't say anything about heels or the color pink. I said that little girls typically like to act like the other girls and women around them, and little boys typically like to act like the other boys and men around them.\n\n> The issue is the assumption you made that all little girls gravitate to what is considered western feminity - which is untrue. \n\nI did not make that assumption at all. I didn't say **anything** about any specific aspect of femininity in this culture or any others, other than the part where I quoted *your words*. Nor did I say that all girls completely reject \"boy things\" or that all boys completely reject \"girl things\" - or that, if they do that during the *preschool years* that this will be the case for their *entire childhood*. I simply said that this is a normal stage that is pretty typical for children entering preschool. I was pretty careful not to say that it happens to *all* children or that it generally lasts for more than a segment of their childhood.\n\nPlease go argue with somebody who actually disagrees with you. This is a waste of both our time.", "The foreskin does not typically begin to retract until age 5 at the earliest, or even as late as the teens.\n\nUnless your child is seriously physically disabled *you* should not be cleaning under the foreskin at bathtime.", "So again, the Dr will instruct for when it's time. Has nothing to do with knowing right out the gate or gender reveals.", "Just wondering, what color cookies do you think those happen to be (or balloons, or cake, or whatever)\n\nYou're being deliberately obtuse if you're denying that we still rely on pink to say girl and blue to say boy.\n\nAnd I truly think it doesn't help. Doctors and nurses are there to help after birth. Are you saying parents that wait are set up for failure somehow?", "To me it suggests that she\u2019s been jealous, rude and nasty for a long time and they are sick of it", "I don\u2019t think someone ends up feeling like OP in a vacuum.\n\nI agree we don\u2019t have any information that justifies OP\u2019s description of her sister as an attention-seeking show-off.  That doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t, we just don\u2019t have much description to go on.\n\nStill, I think the more likely explanation is that the parents fucked up and OP is misplacing blame.", "Or you should teach your kids not to be ashamed of being different. I was never as smart as my sibling but I worked my backside off and my parents saw. If my sibling got an A* instead of an A my parents would praise them, same as I usually got mostly Cs so if I got a B they would praise me for the effort and improvement. They helped with my grades and when I finished secondary I had 1 A, 4 B's and 4 C's because my parents taught me that not being as good at 1 thing doesn't make you less of a person. I was never jealous of my sibling for being more intellegent, it made me want to work harder and my parents were supportive, we tried to find things I was good at, I am more creative and athletic.", "Listen, I'm not saying everything was 100% okay and valid all I'm saying is that it's not the sisters fault. She's mad at her sister for pretty much doing good in her life. Her sister deserved to celebrate her accomplishments and deserves to celebrate her baby with her friends and family to. The sister didn't make herself \"the golden child\". If OP had such a hard life being compared then it's not the sister she should be angry at, it's the parents because parents shouldn't be comparing their kids to begin with. So regardless, her anger is misplaced because her sister shouldn't have to hide her accomplishments because OP didn't do as well \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "She should be upset with her parents, not her sister. Her sister is not the bad guy for wanting to celebrate her accomplishments.", "Weird way of repeating what I said with only a specific part, but yeah. \n\nI get the feeling that we have vastly different styles of raising kids.", "OP is NTA. Everyone that couldn't take no for an answer is.", "So is every other sentence in OPs post. What do you not get? Was it the part where she said her sister is the so called golden child? How about when she called her sister an attention seeker? I can see how that might be confusing to you. She said no and when asked why (which is a big deal when you have to communicate like adults) she gave a reason in which her sister tried to make her feel more welcome and wanted. She could have just responded with a I have prior engagements and that probably would have been the end of it. Did she do that? No. (See that complete sentence i just did right there just for you?)", "Cookies at a party do not solidify a parents parenting style or indicate how the parents raise their children. Or even how they dress the child or the hobbies they put them in. It\u2019s a damn cookie at a party. You sound like you suck the life out of parties.", "It is my impression as well.", "Exactly, focusing on results rather than effort encourages perfectionism and burnout because a lot of kids internalise that if they can't get 100% on the first try, then there's no point trying in the first place.", "It's pointless to continue arguing your point here because this person just isn't gonna see it. I've done and still do what you're trying and sometimes people just don't want to even try to see it from the other side. \n\nI completely agree with what you're saying tho. Op sounds like her jealousy, anger, etc are misplaced and she should get some therapy or something.", "Not buying this. The OP is not stating that her sister cannot have a gender reveal party or celebrate herself with a party.\n\nShe is simply stating that she doesn't want to attend and she has the right to decide if she wants to attend or not, particularly after a lifetime of being made to feel smaller than her sister.\n\nIt's not petty, it's her choice. \n\nThe OP is not the a**hole.\n\n\nEdit: Fixed typo.", "Ok? But it\u2019s the sister that pushed her to try to force her into a situation she made clear she didn\u2019t want to be in. Being the golden child wasn\u2019t her fault but pushing her sisters boundaries as an adult was. Since when is it ok to push people into things they have already said no to?", "Of course she\u2019s not but op said no because she knew this party was going to bring up old feelings. When someone says no that should be respected. You don\u2019t get to push somebody into doing something they\u2019ve said no to for whatever reason then become upset when they push back and give you an answer you don\u2019t like.", "Barring extended infertility, having a baby isn't exactly an accomplishment though, is it? I have a few of my own, and love them dearly, but getting pregnant isn't necessarily praiseworthy, it's just a biological outcome of sex. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Having a child is an accomplishment. That is what baby showers are for celebrating. A child having a gender/sex is not an accomplishment, were all born with one or the other.", "No, I'm plenty of fun, just someone that finds it weird to celebrate a baby's genitals as a social construct. Especially when, as a society, we are so much more aware and knowledgeable about how flawed it is."]}
