I didn't want to deal with her showing off to the entire family in front of me so I told her I won't be coming. She asked why so I told her that I didn't want to deal with her friends and our family.

Why did I always have to do better. Why couldn't I just fail for once. \nI'm going to tell you what I told my sibling. I told them that they were not the main character of my life.  I got top grades for me. So I could get into the college I wanted to go to. So I could shape my life the way I wanted it to go. I didn't make teachers be shitty to them.

Two people can pay in the same amount of effort and get wildly different results.  It's not fair but it's a fact of life.", "How do you know all that? Maybe OP had an undiagnosed learning disability or other mental health issue that prevent them from excelling?", "That doesn't mean you get to shit on someone else's happiness because you don't fucking like a baby shower. \n\nNo one wants to get you started on anything. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nYou can find them tacky and not crush a pregnant family member in the process. Jesus fucking christ", "How is she an attention seeker?", "How is OP justified? They\u2019re clearly just jealous of their sister and were an AH for no reason.", "This right here\n\nEdit: why did I get down voted?", "What do you mean \u201cignoring OP\u2019s own situation\u201d? Are you saying her sister doesn\u2019t celebrate OP\u2019s milestones? Because there\u2019s no indication of that\u2026", "She isn\u2019t supposed to have a gender reveal party because OP is pregnant? Huh?", "She doesn't need to take a hint.

How you did isn\u2019t relevant. Her knowing how you did isn\u2019t relevant. She shouldn\u2019t have to hide her accomplishments or make herself small to make you feel better. \n\nGet over yourself.

Not everything is about you.", "Stop focusing on your sister and blaming her and others for your problems and start focusing on yourself. You definitely need to work on that", "So she should hide *her* accomplishments to protect your feelings? Should she shave her head so you have nicer hair, pour sugar in her gas tank so yours runs better, be homeless so that you can be better host during the holidays? \n\nHow much would you prefer her to give up so you can feel better about yourself?", "Nope. My parents are both driven perfectionists, and so are my siblings and I. If I see one of them excelling, I\u2019m genuinely happy for their success and motivated to strive even harder. If they can succeed, so can I!", "Here\u2019s the thing, she isn\u2019t announcing she got a hundred on a test. She\u2019s announcing the gender of her baby. The fact that you take that as a slight against you shows that you have some major issues that are *yours* to deal with.", "Get help.", "It sounds like you're so busy focused on your sister that you've been neglecting yourself. Reading your post and comments, one can conclude that you think of yourself as a loser. Your sister is the Good One and you're the Bad One. Guess what..? You have the power to change that! \n\nBecome the protagonist in your own life story and not just a side character! Idk how you're going to do that bc I don't know you, so it's all up to you! Good luck!", "This response sounds like it would come from someone who\u2019s choices had nothing to do with their situation and instead there are a million things out of their control that forced them into this situation. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t have bad luck or issues outside your control, but if you absolve your self of any responsibility for where you are and then demand everyone else take responsibility for your situation, then it is most likely a you problem and not everyone else. \n\nTherapy may help you get your head around this, but it doesn\u2019t absolve you from being an AH.", "I\u2019m really sorry your resentment has built to this point, but nothing your sister is doing (in the past or now) seems to be mean spirited even in the way you\u2019ve described. I truly think you would benefit from therapy to talk about your own issues and to help you to stop comparing yourself to your sister\n\nI\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re TA but I wish you all the best and hope you find your own happiness", "You sound so jealous and pathetic. Please get some therapy before you bring your poor kid into your miserable life", "... Are you serious? Do you expect everyone to think about your situation every single moment of their life? So, just because you failed a test or lost your job, your sister can't tell the people in her family that she succeeded at the same thing? How selfish can you be? So she's not allowed to be happy or celebrate her success if you're not succeeding? She's not allowed to share her achievements because you couldn't? \n\nGet over yourself.", "I have a brother, so no. And I'm not the golden child, my mom likes him more than me lol.\n\nWhy should she have to hide her accomplishments? Why is it her fault for trying to include her sister in a party?

OP is going to be a parent and they need to grow up ASAP.", "No she wasn\u2019t. You know the parents are going to see both report cards anyway right?", "Why should she have to adjust to OP? And that does not sound malicious at all. Yeah, imagine not being able to share any achievement that you've had because you keep walking on eggshells, afraid that some small thing is gonna immediately offend your sibling. That's exhausting as fuck.", "Seriously. I\u2019m shocked by all these people saying she\u2019s TA.", "Why is it dumb to invite your friends over to celebrate a milestone?", "While this is true, OP also says in the post that the sister is having *cookies.* I think gender reveal parties are stupid and often dangerous, but ffs it's a food party that has color-themed cookies.", "Your sister doesn't need to hide her excitement about things in her life to make you more comfortable with yours. If she wants to celebrate her baby, she can.\n\nI really think you should seek therapy before your child is born so the resentment you feel for your sister does not affect your child and her relationship with your family", "Did he choke on a cookie?\n\nYes, some gender reveal parties have gotten out of control, but that doesn't mean that all of them are like that.\n\n\nAre you not finding out the gender? There's something special you can have different than your sister, announcing gender along with name/other baby details after birth.", "She does. And her family. If you don't go so be it.

I worked very hard in high school. While my cousins were out playing after school, I was getting my homework done. They used to tease me about wasting my time. I went to college and have a similar life now to OP\u2019s sister. OP doesn\u2019t say she had any learning difficulties etc. I know kids that try hard and get Bs not As. I don\u2019t think many people try hard and get C- and D+s.", "Literally no one is talking about sprinkles except for this person wtf", "Feeling the need to announce everything about her life is a bit attention seeking in my opinion", "That right there", "They aren\u2019t celebrating the baby\u2019s gender.

We started spending time together as friends, and realised we were really alike, and ended up being the best of friends!\n\nOP - resentment mainly affects the person who holds on to it.\n\nYou have spent so much of your life blaming your low self-esteem on someone else instead of focusing on enjoying who you are and what you have. \n\nSeek help now. Talk to someone. Get all of this resentment and pain out of you so it can no longer fester and pin you down. \n\nYou don't have to have a good relationship with your sister.

Or else the rest of your life (and your child's life) will be miserable!", "Lol of course it got deleted", "Omg how dare she share her big life moments with her family! No one in the family cares she\u2019s pregnant or got married. How attention seeking of her. /s", "Announcing things like a baby, engagement, wedding are completely normal. Sharing results of all her tests she taken & grades growing up is a bit much. Makes her seem attention seeking. Also seems she did this to rub it in her sisters face.", "Most parents want to hear about how you did in school, how a test went, when you get a new job, etc. It sounds like OP is jealous of her sister, and quite frankly you also seem jealous of an internet stranger \ud83d\ude02", "She wasn't throwing huge parties every time she did well on a test. But most kids talk to their parents about their grades.", "In close knit families people share their accomplishments, whether they\u2019re big or small. I\u2019m in my 30s and in law school. Whenever I get a good grade, I mention it to my parents."]}
