He\u2019d pick 3-4 machines for his \u201ccircuit\u201d and would come running to anyone who try using them and tell them he\u2019s using them even though he was on the other side of the weight room lol (This was during the 6pm rush hour.)  I immediately went to the front desk and they made him take all the towels off and gave him a warning. Embarrassing him in front of everyone.\n\nSome people do not have good gym etiquette and that\u2019s ok.  Move on.  Next time don\u2019t let him work in.  If you get asked by someone else, make it clear you would be taking turns after every set. Don\u2019t let one person ruin it for everyone else.\n\nAlso, not everyone likes the \u201cwork in\u201d situation.  I disinfect pretty well every machine before using them and it\u2019s not like I want to clean it like a maniac after every set.

Actually, everyone except you was pretty awful.

And you should report that worker as well because he should\u2019ve checked the cameras and see what happened instead of just taking the AH\u2019s word as gospel.", "NTA. That guy is a dweeb and deserves to be shamed for his poor gym etiquette.

Luckily I'm a dude with a pretty intimidating rbf so people tend to not try to talk to me anyways lol.

Some people don\u2019t understand proper gym etiquette.", "NTA. You shared and he should too. Jerk. Not you him. I thought that's how it worked with one machine?", "NTA. That guy is a piece of sh*t. Regular gym goers should know what working in means.", "ESH. I agree with the worker and the other gym members, and I think YOU should have gone to the worker. I would vote much differently if you had verbally criticized him the first or even second time he blew you off--and then dropped it.", "ESH\n\nInstead of messing with the weights and changing them back you should have gone and gotten an employee.", "ESH. What he did was super crappy, but you behaved like a preschooler and got treated like one. Moving the pin? Yelling? Yes, that is toddler behavior. Go find a different machine to work on and gossip about him with the other gym guys like a grown up.", "ESH He was monopolizing the machine but then you tried to force him to stop (to the point that employees had to step in) and then you had a very public tantrum.", "YTA\n\nYou were a considerate person, What that guy did sucked, but your behavior was over the line of what what I would call \u201cstanding up for yourself \u201c\n\nMoving the pin was childish and having a temper tantrum in front of everyone was even more childish.\n\nGoing to staff to report the situation would have been the best approach.\n\nBut, I dont think you should avoid the gym out of embarrassment.
