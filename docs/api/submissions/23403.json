I immediately went to the front desk and they made him take all the towels off and gave him a warning. Embarrassing him in front of everyone.\n\nSome people do not have good gym etiquette and that\u2019s ok.  Move on.  Next time don\u2019t let him work in.  If you get asked by someone else, make it clear you would be taking turns after every set. Don\u2019t let one person ruin it for everyone else.\n\nAlso, not everyone likes the \u201cwork in\u201d situation.  I disinfect pretty well every machine before using them and it\u2019s not like I want to clean it like a maniac after every set.

Actually, everyone except you was pretty awful.

Luckily I'm a dude with a pretty intimidating rbf so people tend to not try to talk to me anyways lol.

I would vote much differently if you had verbally criticized him the first or even second time he blew you off--and then dropped it.", "ESH\n\nInstead of messing with the weights and changing them back you should have gone and gotten an employee.", "ESH. What he did was super crappy, but you behaved like a preschooler and got treated like one. Moving the pin? Yelling? Yes, that is toddler behavior. Go find a different machine to work on and gossip about him with the other gym guys like a grown up.", "ESH He was monopolizing the machine but then you tried to force him to stop (to the point that employees had to step in) and then you had a very public tantrum.", "YTA\n\nYou were a considerate person, What that guy did sucked, but your behavior was over the line of what what I would call \u201cstanding up for yourself \u201c\n\nMoving the pin was childish and having a temper tantrum in front of everyone was even more childish.\n\nGoing to staff to report the situation would have been the best approach.\n\nBut, I dont think you should avoid the gym out of embarrassment.

You could have made your point in a better way but other than that  not the arsehole.", "NTA for the situation, that guy totally deserved that. \nBut yta for the punctuation and \"cz\" \"bcz\", terrible read that was.", "NTA. When I was preparing for a body building contest, I always let people work in. Several times they wouldn't get off the machine and once, after asking this fuckhead to let me work in again and he just stared at me, I physically pulled him off it, roughly. I'm a 5'2\" female and weighed about 145 at 9% .\nHe never fucked with me again. All the guys in the gym were cracking up.", "NTA, he deserved it. He knows what working in means and just tried to push you out. He\u2019s a bully and you exposed the bully. He\u2019s done this before and hopefully won\u2019t again.", "The large gym only had one lat pull machine???", "NTA, you were considerate and polite, and that guy was an absolute jerk. Well done!!!!!", "You are NTA he was. You did the right thing (probably).", "NTA- you clearly stated \"work in\". Everyone knows what that means. He just chose to be an asshole.", "NTA. And good for you. I don't understand why people don't know how to share gym equipment.", "NTA - I know nothing about gym etiquette but entirely based on the response to your calling him out, you're not in the wrong. So were all the other people so okay with him screwing you over with the machine but you calling him out for it is such a horrible awful thing that you should have just let him get away with bullying someone and breaking gym etiquette. Anyone who says someone did something wrong but you calling them out on it was way worse is not an authority of the weighing up of wrong doing.", "esh i mostly agree with those other guys that talked to you after.  it definitely wasnt cool for him to hog the machine at a busy hour after you offered to let him work in.  on the other hand, yelling at him in front of the staff and everybody else there really wasnt a good look and you shouldve tried to keep things more civil.  if you decide to go there again, which i think you should, and you end up seeint him, id recommend you apologize for yelling.  hopefully he'll apologize for not respecting you.  if he doesnt, at least you were the bigger person.", "NTA.\n\n>that i shouldn\u2019t have yelled at him and embarrassed him like that.\n\nWhat other choice did you have though? The gym worker was not listening to you and the AH was smirking. Those guys lecturing you are not much better with demanding women to keep calm and docile and let men treat them unfair without fighting back. If you didn't make a scene, the AH would have won. \n\nAll those guys in that gym sucked that day. You were right of standing. They all deserve to feel embarrassed for their actions. \n\nAnd I actually would complain to the boss of the worker. He didn't even try to get your side of what happened. That might have been a result of sexism.", "NTA! There are two profound assholes in this situation: The muscle bro who commandeered the machine, and the knucklehead employee who took his side. \n\nGood for you for calling him out on his boorish behavior.", "NTA.", "NTA. He attempted to embarrass you by calling in staff. He needed to be called out and  called down. Any embarrassment he felt was entirely of his own making.", "NTA....\n\nNot go back?? Girl... you just pissed in the sand! You just marked your territory! You just showed the whole gym you've got a sense of fairness and won't take any of their shit! \n\nThat's *your* gym now. You're one of them. Don't give that up for some schmuck.", "NTA at all. So proud of you for standing your ground and saying something. Totally agree with everything you said and done. Legend in my eyes.", "NTA. I repeat another comment: fuck that guy. He would have never tried that shit with the men. He\u2019s a misogynist and a chicken. Good on you for lighting him up. Poor little peepee energy got schooled by a grownup. So sad/s", "NTA, I wish I had your courage when a gym rat forced me out of the leg press. I had stood up to pull my pants up higher and he literally moved me aside and started working out.no words or anything I was so flabbergasted and pissed but I couldn\u2019t get words out so I left. That guy deserves to be embarrassed what a jerk", "The worker didn\u2019t rectify the situation, so you were left to fend for yourself.", "My thoughts exactly. I would have said the same thing if not worse.", "How else will he learn?", "I'd also make a formal complaint with management that staff mishandled the situation.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Hold your head up high. People know you did the right thing even if they don't want to admit it.", "Bro really tattled like we're in grade school", "God what absolute garbage I will use two (max two) circuit machines when the gym is dead but if someone sits down before I switch back I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying something!", "Actually, I would add the useless employee was also an AH - so there were actually 2 of them ;)", "Fair enough - 4 sets isn\u2019t 10 though  and obviously you would not let anyone let you work in but would say you prefer to wait and do all your sets consecutively.", "YTA. What you did was fine but you\u2019ve obviously got some issue with men with your \u201cfragile masculinity\u201d chat. It was nothing to do with him being a man.", "As the husband of a Chinese wife, I am endlessly amazed by the \u201ctimid Asian woman/wife\u201d stereotype.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that it must have arisen in the 50\u2019s-70\u2019s as \u201cmanly-man\u201d veterans brought home Korean and Vietnamese wives and were embarrassed to admit to the reality of home life in those cultures.\n\nMy wife runs the household with an iron fist and anyone who attempts to push her around in public will find themselves blushing at the volume and variety of cursing she produces across two languages.", "NTA, guy was a weird mix of toxic and wussy.", "Everyone knows what that means.

You've done the hard bit now, might as well stay. If other people were acknowledging you then you're good. Maybe that guy was an asshole to others too.", "No!!! Own it, and continue to speak up for yourself!!! Future you will appreciate it!", "I agree. I feel like where I live now (Sacramento, CA) that behavior is almost nonexistent. But before I was using university gyms so it was probably clueless kids where now there are some older people who just come to get a workout.", "Or maybe they got downvoted for saying to be even more childish and immature.", "Yep!  It is up to us to toughen them up.  \ud83e\udd23. I find it funny that they downvote with no comments.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "This stereotype is seen in many movies.
