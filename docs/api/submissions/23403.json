That is not gym etiquette...doing 10 sets on a machine and sitting on it while someone is waiting is ridiculous. Working in is sharing the equipment...the equipment that you are also paying to use. \n\nI would have kicked him out of the gym and fired the employee.", "NTA. Fuck that guy. I\u2019m glad you yelled at him in front of everyone. He deserves to be embarrassed.", "NTA, guy was a weird mix of toxic and wussy. he took the machine off you, then when he didn\u2019t get his way he went snivelling to an employee - absolute loser behaviour. you\u2019re right to have put him in his place, but i totally understand why you feel awkward there now. it\u2019s his fault though not yours", "NTA fuck that guy and honestly the employee as well for not even allowing you to explain", "NTA\n\nid find another gym - not because u should be embarrassed to go back but because fuck those people.", "NTA, you offered him the seat to specifically workin together on it. He thought he could just nab it.", "NTA. Self entitlement is high. Working in means sharing the equipment.", "NTA.  I had my share of gym encounters like that. The last one was with a guy who was RESERVING machines with a towel.  He\u2019d pick 3-4 machines for his \u201ccircuit\u201d and would come running to anyone who try using them and tell them he\u2019s using them even though he was on the other side of the weight room lol (This was during the 6pm rush hour.)  I immediately went to the front desk and they made him take all the towels off and gave him a warning. Embarrassing him in front of everyone.\n\nSome people do not have good gym etiquette and that\u2019s ok.  Move on.  Next time don\u2019t let him work in.  If you get asked by someone else, make it clear you would be taking turns after every set. Don\u2019t let one person ruin it for everyone else.\n\nAlso, not everyone likes the \u201cwork in\u201d situation.  I disinfect pretty well every machine before using them and it\u2019s not like I want to clean it like a maniac after every set.  I usually go to the gym around noon when there\u2019s not a lot of people so I don\u2019t ruin the experience during rush hour with my cleaning habits.", "Know what? I want to say TA but I am glad you stood up for yourself. He did the wrong thing and tried tattle on you. You weren\u2019t having any of it. Was is appropriate? Probably not. Did it allow you to finish your workout without being a doormat? Sure did.\n\nNTA. Go back. Keep going back. Don\u2019t be intimidated for sticking up for yourself.", "NTA, no one\u2019s work out is more important when you\u2019re at a gym that everyone pays for, commercial or not. He just needs to get his own equipment at home if he\u2019s this fragile and entitled", "Of course other men are going to think you are wrong for embarrassing him - yet he\u2019s not wrong for embarrassing you when he was not following gym etiquette.  \n\nWhere you are wrong is the game you were playing with changing the weight on the machine. I\u2019m not sure how I would have handled that.  For that reason only I\u2019m going with ESH.  Him for not working in like he was expected to since you were kind enough to share, and you for the game.", "NTA- Glad you stood up for yourself. I'd find another gym since the staff is horrible. Actually, everyone except you was pretty awful. Especially the dudes that saw what was going and still felt like telling you that embarrassing that loser was wrong.", "Good on you for standing up for yourself. He was the one being an AH. It's possible you went over the top enough to also be an A, but maybe not.\n\nSpeak your mind, don't accept having to be uncomfortable just so that other people don't have to be. Hopefully this guy will learn better how to share \n\nNTA", "NTA. When I used to go gym, I used to get pushed off of the boxing bag by the same guy everytime. Even as a dude, they\u2019d just stare at you and try to intimidate you off. These people are assholes no matter who is training. You did the right thing standing up for yourself. And you should report that worker as well because he should\u2019ve checked the cameras and see what happened instead of just taking the AH\u2019s word as gospel.", "NTA. That guy is a dweeb and deserves to be shamed for his poor gym etiquette. People like him are why some people are hesitant to go to the gym in the first place. \n\nThe worker didn\u2019t rectify the situation, so you were left to fend for yourself.", "I never let people work in on my sets. Nope. I usually do 4 sets and wipe the machine down after using it. Not a fan of someone else's sweat mixing with mine. They can wait \ud83e\udd37", "NTA and that's why I'm very reluctant to let anyone work in with me. Luckily I'm a dude with a pretty intimidating rbf so people tend to not try to talk to me anyways lol. But yeah what usually do if someone is starting or waiting on me I tell them I have a long way to go, and if they all if they can work in it tell then no because I need to focus", "NTA.  Some people don\u2019t understand proper gym etiquette.", "NTA. You shared and he should too. Jerk. Not you him. I thought that's how it worked with one machine?", "NTA. That guy is a piece of sh*t. Regular gym goers should know what working in means.", "ESH. I agree with the worker and the other gym members, and I think YOU should have gone to the worker. I would vote much differently if you had verbally criticized him the first or even second time he blew you off--and then dropped it.", "ESH\n\nInstead of messing with the weights and changing them back you should have gone and gotten an employee.", "ESH. What he did was super crappy, but you behaved like a preschooler and got treated like one. Moving the pin? Yelling? Yes, that is toddler behavior. Go find a different machine to work on and gossip about him with the other gym guys like a grown up.", "ESH He was monopolizing the machine but then you tried to force him to stop (to the point that employees had to step in) and then you had a very public tantrum.", "YTA\n\nYou were a considerate person, What that guy did sucked, but your behavior was over the line of what what I would call \u201cstanding up for yourself \u201c\n\nMoving the pin was childish and having a temper tantrum in front of everyone was even more childish.\n\nGoing to staff to report the situation would have been the best approach.\n\nBut, I dont think you should avoid the gym out of embarrassment.  You acted out of frustration, it happens, move on.  Everyone there will forget it soon enough.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
