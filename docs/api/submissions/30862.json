One of my friends (27f) who we'll call \"Sophie\" has been very vocal about her being on a diet and trying to lose weight although it doesn't seem to be very successful.\n\nAnyway, we had a meal which was just tacos although I'd also ordered a pizza for anyone who would prefer one. Sophie eats A LOT of food; I'm talking about 6 slices of pizza and a couple tacos. I didn't mention it because it wasn't my business and I just assumed she was not worrying with her diet today. \n\nAfter that we brought the cake out and she had a couple slices of that before we settled down to watch a movie where she ate some popcorn (I'd drank quite a lot of alcohol by that point so wasn't aware of this but she told me the next day). \n\nEveryone went home and I thought the party had been a success as everyone seemed to have had fun. However, the next day I received a message from her telling me I was a bad friend for giving her all that food and taking advantage of her condition (drunk) to make her overeat when I know she's on a diet. \n\nI don't think I did anything wrong as I didn't force her to eat all that food and I shouldn't be responsible for policing her duet.

She overate all by her adult self. \n\nSo you're not allowed to celebrate your birthday with food and drink? No one else at a party can have food either? Or it has to be limited to her liking? She also chose all by herself to drink a lot of calories to get drunk. Whose fault is that?", "NTA. You can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be expected to control her eating habits. What a weird thing to confront you over.", "NTA. The idea that you shouldn't have fattening food at your birthday party just because one of your friends is on a diet is absurd. If she can't control herself she should have stayed home. She's just feeling guilty that she fell off her diet and is trying to pass the blame to you.", "NTA. She has a problem with self-control. She could have looked for your and your friends help by asking you to watch out that she doesn't take more than X pieces for example. But even then - she is an adult, she shouldn't blame her lack of discipline on others.", "NTA. The way from the plate to Sophie's mouth needs to be policed by Sophie and Sophie alone. It has nothing to do with other people, unless she is trying to eat their personal share of the food. You were just being a good host.", "NTA\n\nServe what you want, she can eat what she wants\n\nYBWTA if, for example, you were. Like \"here's tacos and pizza for everybody except Sophie who gets carrot sticks!\"\n\nYou just put food out, which is expected and normal at a party", "NTA. Her overindulgence isn\u2019t your fault. She choose to go to a birthday party where food was served and she didn\u2019t have a plan for dealing with the temptation. Learning that skill is entirely up to her. \n\nThe world isn\u2019t going to stop eating or having food around her, and if she doesn\u2019t have the control not to over eat based on her own goals (especially when she chose to drink as well), she should decline invitations. Avoiding situations she isn\u2019t ready for is also her responsibility and not yours.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m on a diet and I\u2019m currently pissed at OP for not DMing me and reminding me not to buy ice cream. Now I won\u2019t reach my weekly goal and it is all OP\u2019s fault!\n\nShe\u2019s responsible for herself. Guaranteed, if you had said anything to her, she would\u2019ve complained that you are trying to control her.", "NTA. You would have been is she was five. If not, she is either capable of not eating SIX SLICES OF PIZZA, A COUPLE SLICES OF CAKE, A COUPLE TACOS AND POP CORN, or she needs professional help to work on how to resist food temptation.\n\nEither way, it is not your job to babbysit your friends.", "Did you sit in her lap, pry her mouth open, and shovel in the food?  No?  Then NTA.  It's not your job to police someone else's eating habits.", "I'm sorry, did you just say that she thinks you took advantage of her drunkenness to make her over eat? Like that was an evil plan you had? \n\nIt's a really weird thing to accuse someone of. Also, if you do want to come up with an evil plan, I bet you can do way better. \n\nObviously NTA, but also Sophie comes across as not an entirely well person.", "NTA. I would not invite her to any further parties, and I\u2019d let her know why.", "Goodness you are NTA. She's projecting her own frustration and guilt onto you because she feels bad about eating all that food the night before. Instead of owning up to it and moving on, she is pushing the blame onto you. Don't take it to heart, she's being ridiculous.", "NTA she is an adult who stuffed A LOT of food in. She could have practiced moderation but she didn\u2019t that was her choice not yours", "NTA\n\nwhat, were you supposed to not get any food? or make everyone else go hungry to support her diet?\n\nshe needs to regulate her diet herself. in fact you telling her to eat less or trying to stop her eating the food would be horribly overstepping.", "100% NTA. \n\nHer behaviour is no-one's responsibility but hers. SHE made the choice to eat. She could've said \"No thank you\" and not eaten. Hell if she was uncomfortable and didn't think she would be able to resist overeating, she could've simply left the party early (which is probably what I would've done). \n\nPeople like your friend like to blame their problems on everyone else because they don't want to confront the very PAINFUL truth. Trust me, I know.", "NTA", "NTA!! It\u2019s not your duty to make sure she sticks to her diet. If she has an unhealthy relationship with food, unfortunately nothing but a therapist can help her with that. Counting someone\u2019s food intake (whether or not they\u2019re on a diet) is not your responsibility. She should practice her self control and not shame you for her own choices.", "Sophie is responsible for Sophie's caloric intake and weight. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Drinking is a LOT of carbs and calories. Does she do that often? If so she's kind of shooting herself in the foot with her diet anyway.", "NTA\n\nDid you pin her down and feed her or threaten her if she didn\u2019t eat?\n\nShe\u2019s a full blown adult and only she is responsible for what she eats.  Yes, dieting is hard, but nobody but herself put that food in her mouth.", "NTA. It's not like you pointed a gun at her and shoved food down her throat. She ate what she ate out of her own free will.\n\nShe's offloading her guilt, shame and most importantly her choice and responsibility on to you. She made bad choices at the meal and continued to do so by blaming you. I feel sad for her inability to reflect and change and believe she would benefit from help in this.\n\nDon't feel bad OP you didn't do anything wrong. :)", "NTA you\u2019re just an easier excuse for her to blame than herself. She\u2019s deflecting to cause herself less self-loathing.", "NTA. However, your friends reaction tells me she may have an eating disorder and need help. But you are right, it is not your. place to tell her what she can and cannot eat. The only way you would be TA here is if she specified before the party that she couldn't eat certain stuff and you only had stuff on hand she couldn't eat.", "NTA - For one, someone else's diet and impulse control is not your problem. Secondly, it's a birthday party. There is undoubtedly going to be unhealthy food. She could have eaten something before hand or asked if it was okay to bring her own stuff. Dieting is frustrating, 100% , but just because /you/ are trying to eat healthy, it doesn't mean everyone around you has to adjust their lifestyle to yours.", "She\u2019s not a 5 year old. You\u2019re not her mother and you need not restrict her caloric intake. She\u2019s a grown ass woman. If she can\u2019t control herself then that\u2019s on her. She could have brought a salad and had one taco or one slice of pizza. If she wants to lose weight she knows how to do it and no one else can do it for her.", "NTA. The diet only affects those who want it. She's on the diet, meaning she should have the will to say no.", "That wasn't very nice of you to tie her down and force all that food down her gullet.\n\nGees. She needs to learn to take responsibility for her own actions.  Minus that she isn't going to get control of her food issue.  And she has the unmitigated gall of blaming you.  \n\nI have food issues. I could probably eat her under the table.  \nBut I know that is my responsibility. Don't show to a party starving, hydrate with water,  eat slow, pick foods that aren't calorie dense.  Avoid alcohol. Eat dessert first. \n\nNTA.", "NTA tell sloaphie or sofa, she\u2019s large and in charge of her own shit. Fuck that.", "NTA. She's an adult who can make her own choices. No one forced her to over eat, or eat at all. Plus diets are BS. It needs to be a lifestyle change which has to include some \"cheat\" foods because life happens. \n\nI do this to my husband who is on a diet constantly. I'll respect his wishes and not order him pizza or make up a plate for him if he declined but hell if I'm not baking cookies for myself/the house. At that point it's on him to control himself or not.\n\nEta: he's not overweight. He just wants to be cut. If it was a health concern I'd be more supportive.", "NTA\n\nSophie, like so many just like her these days, is unwilling to take accountability for her own actions.\n\nNot your problem.\n\nSIX slices of pizzas, two tacos, two pieces of cake and popcorn?  Exactly, what diet is Sophie on?  Is it a Seefood diet?", "NTA But what you can do next time is have alternative options if  you're just drinking with Sophie, but ask her first, dont just act. You don't HAVE TO by any means, but I think the gesture is sincere. The thing is, she has to be accountable for herself, and while she is on her weight loss journey, you don't have to be her warden, but just be her friend. She's gonna go through many failures before finding what works for her, and the best thing to do is to just be supportive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Overeating to that extreme is common in people with eating disorders - if she's restricting constantly, then as soon she lets herself indulge a little her body takes over and makes her eat EVERYTHING because she's been starving herself. I'm really not trying to armchair diagnose her, but this sounds a lot more extreme than just lack of self control to me. Tacos, 6 slices of pizza, AND a few slices of cake is wild. \n\nPlease also know that it is NOT YOUR JOB to help her with this, especially if you're not that close.

I used to feel this way when I was struggling with an ED but never voiced it. Now recovered I can see that that is delusional and unhealthy thinking.
