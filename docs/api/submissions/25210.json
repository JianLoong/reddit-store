I live in SoCal and it wasn't even a tropical storm by the time it hit the USA.  Wasn't even that windy.  All you had to do was look out a window.  I'm more pissed about how people down here drive when there is just the slightest chance of weather.  I swear if it snowed here people would just pull over, throw away their keys and just say \"Fuck it\".", "YTA\n\none it wasn\u2019t even a hurricane by the time it hit palm springs, it was a tropical storm\n\ntwo you keep saying it was your car, since it was and no one could\u2019ve left if you didn\u2019t want to, you clearly had some part in leaving", "I'm hesitant to fully accept that you're representing this accurately as you refer to driving 'straight into the hurricane' but the storm was downgraded to tropical storm well before the actual hurricane part of the storm hit Palm springs and to post-tropical storm awhile ago as well.  The word has a definition that could not have been met in the location you described.  That makes me think you are exaggerating the story.  The roads you traveled on must not have been closed otherwise you wouldn't have been able to.  So YTA for blowing it out of proportion, especially now that everyone is home safely, and for not being grateful for them getting you home safe.  Also, you had free will, you did not have to go with them.  Be mad at yourself if you're mad about getting in the car.  Sounds like you're resenting a decision that has fully played out with no adverse consequences.  Stop moaning about it.  I have driven in low strength hurricanes and tropical storms... It's not fun- but getting somewhere/ away from somewhere can be the right decision... Now if the driver was reckless in how they drove, id have sympathy - but that's not your argument.", "Soft YTA for the never forgiving them part. That might have been a bit of an overreaction. I can certainly understand your concern, especially if you have never experienced a hurricane before.\n\nI've been through several hurricanes and driven through quite a bit of inclement weather. Including times when the advisory was not to drive at all. I'm completely confident in my experience to drive in those kinds of conditions.\n\nI don't know if it is the same with your fiance, and if that's why they chose to drive back. However, if it was, he could have probably done a better job of reassuring you.", "I suspect this will be unpopular, but NAH, apart from calling you a crybaby and telling you you should be grateful.   That stuff was AH behavior.  However, on the decision about whether to travel, that's what I'm giving an NAH.  People just have very different tolerance of risk and experience of driving in bad conditions.  You sound VERY VERY risk averse, which I totally get.  And very much the safest thing!  That said, I'm sympathetic to your friends/fiance deciding to drive, since it's probably what I would do.  Also, you sound extremely dramatic (\"driving into the hurricane\" lol, hardly), and they may unfortunately be in the mode of downplaying your fears if this is a pattern.  You're certainly not TA for being afraid.\n\nETA - OK, I've read your comments that it was your car.  That probably pushes me toward NTA, though you sound really exhausting to be around so I can feel their frustration after 24 hours of drama.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNobody FORCED you to do anything - YOU decided to go with them. You could have decided to stay back, you CHOSE not to. Take responsibility for YOUR actions.", "NTA but I'd rethink the \"fianc\u00e9\" thing.", "ESH. They suck for forcing you to go when you were so scared. You suck for being a drama queen and not letting it go. Shit happens, everybody is safe, time to move on.", "Info: what time did this all take place?\n\nEdit: Honestly, ESH. It was your car, you willingly handed over the keys and you willingly got into the car. Not much forcing there considering other decisions could've been made. Everyone put themselves at needless risk but at the end of the day, you're all fine. I want to say that the conditions weren't all that bad but areas such as Palm Springs were admittedly hit harder. Something could've happened and you all would have been SOL. Emergency lines went down at a certain point on Sunday evening and they wouldn't have been able to help if you had driven into flooded areas. You're all extremely lucky to not have gotten stuck in flood waters. So at the end of the day, poor decisions were made by everyone. You can be mad at your friends and your fiance but you aren't blameless in this situation.", "NTA: many things could have gone wrong and you were advised to not leave the house. \n\nHow was that emotional if something were to happened? And how was that a cry baby who exaggerates stuff?  When there are severe weather warning that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s something serious \n\nOp you don\u2019t need a fianc\u00e9 and friends like these one. And op don\u2019t listen to them.", "The only thing that you seem to have done wrong is choose that guy for your fianc\u00e9 and those people for your friends. I really, really hope that this is another case of an AITA post where the people who are obviously the AHs are not like that any other time. \n\nIf you are getting belittled frequently, believe it or not, a hurricane isn't your biggest problem. You're not to blame for them having no respect for you or a fucking hurricane in fucking California. Seriously, what kind of morons drive through a hurricane, much less in a state that has no infrastructure for hurricanes!?!?\n\nNTA x1000. If they refuse to apologize, please reconsider these relationships. One of them could almost get you killed. Again.", "NTA \n\nA lot of commenters don't seem to be understanding what the threat with this storm actually was. \n\nFlash flooding was the most dangerous part of it and it can pop up out of nowhere. It can be dry all day over a certain area but rain a shit ton upstream and the piddly gully that is typically only a trickle can become a raging river. Especially with all the burn scar areas that are hydrophobic. Not to mention the greater possibility of mudslides, etc. Shoot, my friend's house on the east side of Houston flooded FIVE days after Harvey made landfall because of all the rain that fell north of her house. \n\nI grew up in the Houston area so I've experienced a decent amount of tropical weather and if you have a safe place to stay then that's what you should do. Leave the roads open for the people that actually NEED to be out.", "NTA. Your \"friends\" are stupid, irresponsible and selfish.", "NTA. I'm downgrading your current fianc\u00e9 from a Cat 5 hurricane to a tropical storm.", "NTA. What they did was fucking stupid. Roads can get very slick when it rains in California due to a build up of road oil. That combined with high winds and heavy rain created hazardous driving conditions. Dump these friends and the fiance. You had every right to be scared.", "I was in the hurricane. It wasn't a big deal. YTA for letting your emotions create conflict after the decision had already been made. Also, you're an adult and could've stayed and taken a bus later, or rented a car. They didn't force you into anything.\n\nAgain, I drove all day for my job in the storm. It was not a big deal.", "YTA, if you were in the NBA, your name would be Carmellodramatic.", "My kids live on the beach, and it wasn't that bad. No driving restrictions. They were more weirded out by the earthquake. YTA", "YTA. Lord in heaven.", "It was seriously nothing more than a rainstorm. We had worse storms that i was driving in this past winter. You were absolutely fine and likely not in any more danger than a regular storm. You definitely overreacted and yes that makes you TA.", "I live down south so have experienced a few hurricanes and tropical storms. Going with ESH. That storm was downgraded by the time it hit Palm Springs so no need to exaggerate the situation. You also could have refused to go with them. As for the boyfriend and friends, even though it was downgraded by then that storm still had heavy rains and winds. Mother Nature should not be underestimated. Even down in my state during a heavy storm people stay home to avoid roads and bridges that can easily be flooded because that water moves faster than most people realize.", "Your fiance and friends are morons.\n\nNTA", "Your fianc\u00e9 and friends are the very definition of fake news in your life, ditch them while you save yourself. They have no regard for you at all.", "NTA. The people saying it wasn't even a hurricane when it hit and it was no big deal are kind of missing the point. The reason traffic control advised you not to leave your house isn't only because it could have been dangerous for you, but because if you had crashed and needed help you would have been diverting emergency workers from other areas where they may have been needed more. \n\nAlso, CA doesn't get hurricanes and got an unprecedented amount of rain all at once. I'd be wary of driving on any road during a storm like that because you don't really know how that much rain is going to impact the roadways. Bridges could collapse, or roads could flood entirely. It's really not that hard to just stay in when you're advised to.", "NTA. How are you being emotional for having self-preservation? Many things could have gone wrong, and you were right to be worried. You were even advised by the professionals to not leave the house. You were not wrong.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t feel safe and made it known, after suggesting you leave a day sooner to avoid it all together. You expressed your feelings and are being told that you\u2019re emotional and a crybaby instead of your fianc\u00e9 or friends apologizing or trying to understand why you were uncomfortable and felt unsafe. \nHuge red flag with your fianc\u00e9. Anyone who tries to invalidate your feelings is an AH.", "What they did was dangerous and is how people get killed. They should have listened to you and not try their luck.", "YTA - you made it home safe what are you complaining about? you ARE safe", "NTA. Your car, your safety DO matter. They ran right over your reasonable wish to be safe. It was stupid, CA authorities were saying driving was unsafe!\n\nYou should have held onto your keys and refused. Ditch the fiance who DOES NOT CARE what you think or to keep you safe - those are not the actions of someone who loves you.", "Imo, NTA.

I\u2019m confused because it wasn\u2019t regular rain. EVEN my friends who wanted to go home were agreeing that it was pretty bad. Our argument wasn\u2019t if it was bad or not. We all knew it was bad!", "True i guess, but in that moment I thought I\u2019m gonna make the argument worse by keeping the keys. It took me until today to understand that the road we took and the way people drove was not safe at all. And we could have easily gotten into an accident. I just thought staying a few more hours and waiting for the sun to rise before driving back was a safer option.", "I\u2019m here to genuinely ask for your opinions about this situation. I\u2019m calm and trying to understand whar really my mistake was and what their mistake was so we avoid stuff like this in the future. I admit that i gave the keys after i was called a crybaby because I really believed i was wrong for being scared. But after 3 hours of almost peeing myself in the car i decided that i was not wrong for feeling unsafe. Doesn\u2019t matter how strong the hurricane ended up to be. At the moment we didn\u2019t know how strong it would hit. Plus the direction we were heading to ws the direction the storm was heading to so we were moving with it essentially. And there was an earthquake in the area earlier that day so i was really panicking. I\u2019m not trying to blame anyone for my decisions. I want to understand what do people think about this situation and how would they react.", "I know, I just spoke with one of my friends and she said she was scared to death too. But she needed to go to school today which was by the way canceled lol.", "Around 3.5 hours. Usually takes less around 2 hours but there were some accidents and a road closure.", "I would still marry him but i want him to protect himself and live long enough for us to get married.", "Not really but after reading some comments i think i can  see different points of views. I can\u2019t fully say they are wrong although in my heart if we go back to the same situation I would still not want to leave until everything is cleared up", "I just know you don\u2019t f with nature. What seems regular one moment can be catastrophic the next. The news kept announcing that it looks like a category 4 hurricane but we don\u2019t know what to expect when it hits. Then my mom called from LA and told me they just experienced an earthquake. So in my mind i was going out into the storm and heading back to where they just experienced an earthquake and were expecting hurricane to hit.", "I might be an ahole for not keeping my keys and letting them go back home so the argument wouldn\u2019t escalate more.", "If i show you how it looked out of my window. It was worse than what it actually was on the freeway. The rain created a flood that came inside the house. It wasn\u2019t something to damage the house severely since it\u2019s a pool house, but it looked pretty bad.", "No way is our species going to survive to see the distant future. Not when we spend billions of dollars on meteorological equipment and countless man hours training people to be experts on the subject of the sky falling, while so many people choose to ignore all that and just \"look out a window\" instead.", "I hope you live long with this mindset. Calling me a chicken because i wanted to be safe? Doesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s a hurricane or a strong rain. Our freeways get flooded by regular rains. You are one if those people who doesn\u2019t understand how unexpected the power of nature can be.", "1. Yes unfortunately we can die anytime but stupid decisions can make it happen faster. \n2. K5 really has shitty windows! The top part broke that one time but the front windshield cracked twice in the past 3 years.", "Yeah cars drive like crazy. I really wanted them to be safe. We had the same issue during the earthquake in 2021. I was hiding under the table and everyone was laughing lol. Same people. So i don\u2019t trust their survival instincts.", "santa clarita is 3 hours away from palm springs, the way weather works, is that different areas get different ranges of it\n\nand what if palm springs flooded and the airbnb wasn\u2019t the safest option? y\u2019all got where you needed to safely, you should be thankful that worked out and that your bf drove well especially since you literally saw accidents on the sides of the roads", "Yeah best decision would have been driving before it hit. We had plenty of time to take action.", "Oh yes i live nearby and my clients were joking about it with me since Friday.", "I literally live 30 min away. No need.", "It sounds like you indeed have learned something about yourself / life etc.  I'm glad you're all safe.  I hope you and your friends find a way to move on from this.", ">It took me until today to understand that the road we took and the way people drove was not safe at all. \n\nIf ***you*** took until now to see that how is that their fault?", "It was your car.  You had the power to say no.\n\nYou are *very* clearly trying to blame everyone else as though you had no agency.\n\nYou got home safely despite the conditions, then spewed on everyone.  (YTA)  What was the point?  It was done.  You've just damaged your relationship without making yourself or anyone else safer.  \n\nIf you are concerned about this being a risk you don't want to take again, you need to look at how *you* could act differently.", "Btw, just on the topic of your relationship, ignore 99% of what people say on here. One or two poor decisions and everyone screams for you to move across the country. This is something worth remembering, but not necessarily worth drastically altering the course of your entire life over.", "No, that would make them the assholes and you'd 100% be fine.\n\nBut when you acquiesced to take them home, you became an active and necessary part of the driving process. You can't opt into something and blame others for it. You had the ability to say no, just not the confidence to.", "Exactly, I\u2019m telling you my friends dance during earthquakes and take videos of it. Dumbasses would not survive long with this attitude.", "I mean, I don\u2019t even remember what earthquake we had in 2021 because we get them all the time here so I\u2019m assuming it was mild. We just had one yesterday too, and I just sat on my couch and felt my room sway a bit. I could see why people who are from here might think that\u2019s a bit extreme to hide under the table but they shouldn\u2019t laugh at you for being safe at the same time. Sounds like your friends are immature jerks.", "We were heading to glendale and sylmar. It\u2019s not that far from santa clarita.", "Exactly! I just can\u2019t get behind this \u201csurprise\u201d when everyone knew it was coming.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the few nice things about hurricanes, you can see them coming and prepare.", "Thanks hairy balls! But palm desert was close too but no flooding there. Idk why you think 30 minutes is not enough dar to have different conditions.", "They are more than friends to me. One is my fiance I\u2019ve been with him for 7 years. And the others are my childhood friends. Very close people. Argumets between us are normal we argue and come back no matter what. But i didn\u2019t want any of them to get hurt in any way. We were at Palm Springs we only wore slippers and shorts. We didn\u2019t have any proper clothing or even a jacket to wear had anything happened to the car or us. So i was trying to explain how at least a pair if shoes and a jacket could be lifesaving in situations like this. I\u2019m not thinking about flood taking my car but a small accident could have been worse in these situations when you have nothing ready. I was just trying to protect everyone as much as I could.", "I think I mis worded it. During the drive they kept telling me see it\u2019s not bad see it\u2019s not bad. And yours just overly dramatic. We we\u2019re constantly ignoring the flash flood alert on the navigation. And i kept saying ok yeah maybe I\u2019m must be dramatic. But when i hot home it hit me hard. I thought whoever wanted to leave could leave by my fianc\u00e9 should have stayed by my side and traveled when it was really safe for us to travel.", "These people are my family. I\u2019ve been friends with two of them for 18 years. The third person is my twin sister, and the forth person is my fiance who Ive been with for 7 years. I say firnds people think it\u2019s kust a short term friendship but it\u2019s all i know. They\u2019re part if my life and an argument like this is not going to break it. I just didn\u2019t know which one of us was right. I don\u2019t want them to be unsafe doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m with them or not.", "Thanks for saying this. I really love the people i was with. They were not going to leave me there or I wasn\u2019t going to let them leave alone. People say I wasn\u2019t forced to leave it was my car. But if they understand the gravity of my relationship with thise people they would understand that with long term friendship comes trust. I trusted when they said it was safe and i was being dramatic. But mid way they all agreed it was not safe. I have videos our car was moving with the wind. It\u2019s not really unusual on the way back from palms to hit some winds but it was not safe with flooded freeways. But I would never break up my whole relationship over this. My fianc\u00e9 is with me reading these and we are still arguing who wascright hahaha. My friends are comito my house tonight for a round of monopoly. We didn\u2019t argue to a point of destroying the relationship. But i really really want them to understand it\u2019s important to be safe even if it ends up being nothing. I want them to be safe with or without me in the car.", "True, I thought by keeping the keys and telling them to leave however they wanted to would make the situation worse. I just hoped to get home safely and explain to them how safety measures would save their lives. I wasn\u2019t expecting them to not understand my emotions. I took my time to think about it and let them get rest before I brought this up. But i guess they couldn\u2019t even get my point of view at all. I try to get theirs I really do.", "Never said that, but cool. I am fairly acquainted with how weather works. You got home completely safely and it\u2019s pretty obvious it was simply a heavy rainstorm, my vote isn\u2019t changing nor is my opinion.", "Given the preciousness of these relationships, surely you are all incentivized to put this behind you.  If you talk about it more with them, perhaps lead with your caring concern or fears, their importance to you and therefore your caution. I wouldn't try and talk them out of their opinions on whether it was prudent as I don't think you'll have an easy time getting them to regret the decision, but you may be able to get them to empathize with your feelings and respect that you found it traumatic (not sure if that's the right word?)... We're all entitled to feel our feelings so hopefully you can all get to a point where everyone's are understood and respected, perhaps not relatable though as that sounds like an impasse.  Fortunately this situation is unlikely to repeat.", "I feel you. I used to tell people what was dangerous about their driving, but I stopped after 3 consecutive times I \"cursed them\" into crashing within a month after I opened my mouth. \n\nBut I've gotta ask... Monopoly? Tensions are already high haha. Might not be the best idea, unless you all can do that with civility.", "Hahahahah! True! We play either UNO or monopoly. It\u2019s funny but we argue during the game and finish arguing as soon as the game ends lol. Good way to take some steam off!", "Awesome. My friends and I occasionally play Uno on our PCs, which usually takes 40-60+ minutes. I feel like it's the same vibe. But one round is all we can handle before the blown off steam starts to build up haha", "Hahahaha! I guess it\u2019s a change if plans ! we need to do a movie night so no one talks! We just enjoy each other\u2019s company without saying a word lol!", "NTA. You need a new fiance and friends who will not discount your feelings and advice from public safety. Your group is very lucky you got thru when you did. Also ESH because of my Pet peeve.  I'm frustrated by folks who don't bother to completely read or listen to weather forecasts. East Coast resident of the US here, hurricanes are something we stay aware of all season, and hurricane season is June 1 to November 30 every year.  It was clear and forecast in advance of the storm that the intensity of the wind would decrease once it made landfall and reached cooler water. Hurricanes and tropical storms are classified by wind speed around the low pressure center.  It was clear and forecast in advance of the storm that the biggest concern was intense rain in low lying areas, in desert areas, and in the mountains, where it could cause flash floods, landslides, road hazards, and possibly cause drowning. Death valley national Park is closed because of flooding and road damage. I'm glad y'all got home safe.", "YTA\n\nPlease for fuck sake it wasn't even a Hurricane. it was a tropical storm. Put your drama panties away.", "Yta. The hurricane was on the news for a while before it came in, like almost a week. You had to know before you left that it would be breaking on the day you left. Even the radio was warning about it most of last week.\n\nIt was also downsized to a tropical storm before it hit the USA border. Did you miss that on the news? When a hurricane hits land, it disapates. You do need to worry about flooding in the desert, but it has to rain for hours for that to happen like after you drove out. \n\nDo you see the Palm Springs floods in the news? It was bad. Had you stayed, you may still be there. But your hubs got you out.\n\nBe glad hubs was trying to get you home safe. It would be worse to be stick in the air bnb for days, paying for it. You got 1 day free.", "If you honestly believe your life was in danger you could have took a flight back home if it was available, Bus or rented a car and drove back.", "They just drive an hour to Idy or BB when they want to block traffic in the snow. They don\u2019t pull over though. They just stop in the middle of the road and get out to trample people\u2019s yards and throw trash everywhere.", "Several roads in southern California were hit by flash floods during the storm, and a section of route 58 is still closed because it\u2019s buried under five feet of mud. \n\nI drove past it on my way to work this morning and saw a tractor trailer stuck in the middle of it half buried. Depending on which roads they were driving on, OP and their friends really might have been in danger.", "I suggest you check the news. There was catastrophic flooding. A local emergency was declared. OP did not exaggerate.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear how OP was to get home?", "Come on like I didn\u2019t ask if it was a hurricane or a storm! Doesn\u2019t matter what it was the end was that the freeway was flooded and not too safe to travel!", "If it was your car (and presumedly you were the driver) you should have just noped them.  As the driver and owner that is your choice.  Their choice is to find alternative travel if they don't like it.", "Do you guys get tropical storms? I'm just curious, I grew up on long island and we had these every year but the news makes it sound like it's unusual out there (I know it's unusual for a tropical storm to still be powerful after it crosses Mexico).", "I live in San Diego and it is the first tropical storm warning ever put out.  \n\n\nThe problem is landslides and flash floods, not the storm per se.  Palm Springs is especially problematic because of the passes and potential for flash floods.", "It is very unusual to get tropical storms but we get rain and it sometimes rains heavy. Truly we were hit harder this winter by El Ni\u00f1o. It was 90 degrees today and my backyard is bone dry like nothing happened lol. Ca drivers are stupid rain drivers that\u2019s for sure, but it wasn\u2019t anything different than what we\u2019ve recently experienced anyway.", "Wasn\u2019t even a tropical storm, flooding is deadly but this had 0 concerning winds", "Flash floods are terrifying, there's nothing to be done if you're caught in one, I'm not too keen on landslides either.", "Gotcha, glad you're ok", "We will rebuild lol", "Lol", "Girl, you need a new fianc\u00e9. Does he not realize he\u2019s supposed to at least pretend to care about you until you\u2019re actually married? Good lord.", "OP, were you all driving in the same car, or could your snotty and cavalier friends have gone home on their own? If they had their own car, I would have said, \"Go with God, y'all. I'm staying right here.\"", "YTA. Were you physically restrained and dragged into the car? Then you weren't forced to risk your life", "Ehhhh. I gotta say YTA. I live in socal, and it was not that bad. Yes, there was a lot of water, but the rain wasn't coming down very hard the majority of the time, and there was very little wind. It's okay that you were scared, most people in California aren't used to driving in bad weather, but you also were in charge and you made the decision to do what your friends wanted. You could have put your foot down and said no. At the end of the day, everything turned out fine, so you're just creating worst case scenarios in your head and getting mad about them, even though they didn't happen.", "Don't know about Palm Springs but other areas had alerts not to be on the roads for fear of flash floods", "Flights back home? From palms to LA?", "Hahahahaha! Exactly! He didn\u2019t even pretend to care. He keeps telling me I\u2019m fine I\u2019ll get over it. My fianc\u00e9 in general doesn\u2019t really understand what\u2019s fear or anger lol. He thinks every emotion besides happiness is not real \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so if i say I\u2019m scared he thinks it\u2019s just smt i pretend. Idk if Ive ever seen him get scared or cry. Lol", "Originally we were 9 people. 2 cars 4people on a different car and 5 people in my car. The 4 people left in the morning before the storm hit. But the people in my car wanted to stay longer and wait and leave later. We had late checkout and they wanted to use it to the fullest. So by the time the store hit there were 5 people inside the house and only my car left.", "I think you are lucky if you don\u2019t understand that you can be forced emotionally too. I was being told that i was a cry baby and it wasn\u2019t bad. I was being told that if i don\u2019t leave they won\u2019t! But also if they get fired it\u2019s my fault.", "True, Idk how much more I could argue to make them stay tho. I just want them to be more considerate. They are not only friends they are my family. They are all I know in my life. Thinking of one of them getting hurt gives me really bad anxiety. One is my fianc\u00e9 the person that i love and trust amd want to live my whole life with. The other is my twin sis and two very old close friends. So I just want th to understand that if tjis time it was ok, in general they need to be more considerate and try to be safe. The sameee argument happened during the 2021 earthquake the 7magnitude earthquake hit and they were just running around dancing and videoing themselves. Idk why they just don\u2019t understand how to be safe. That makes me mad.", "But you are right i just think of the worst. It\u2019s my way of protecting the people i really love. I always overthink in general lol. This issue is resolved in their minds but in my mind I\u2019m still creating scenarios as you said and getting upset about it. I think that\u2019s what i need to work on. Thanks for your honest opinion.", ">how could i know it wouldn\u2019t get worse.\n\nif you couldn't know, you shouldn't have given your keys.\n\neveryone else may have wanted to go but you *chose* to give them your keys, you *chose* to get in the car, and you're now *choosing* to shove all responsibility onto other people because you were too wishy-washy to do what you felt was safe.", "Idk where ur from but im from south florida, we have hurricane season yearly, there things you pickup and learn, watching the storm on radar year after year you pickup some stuff.\n\nIt was a cat 2 IIRC before making landfall, storms are known tk slow SIGNIFICANTLY when they make landfall and it was downgraded to a tropical storm as a result, OP sounds dramatic. \n\nESH tho\n\nIANAM", "I\u2019ve checked the news.  \n\nThere were warnings of \u201ccatastrophic flooding\u201d before the hurricane hit, and then that changed to \u201csome flooding\u201d after the storm.\n\nI can tell you now, if you consider what you went through as \u201ccatastrophic \u201c, you need to go live in a desert where it never rains and never leave there.", "Not American, but some concept. mate did 8 flights to get back home during COVID. People rented a car and drove 14hr etc... Years ago I remember a guy taxing a taxi for almost 900km.   \n\nAll I'm saying is if it was life or death, you choose to stay", "I can understand that perspective. I had someone very close to me die several years ago, and since then I've had quite a bit of anxiety around the people I love being safe. You could sit down with them and tell them about how you're feeling, and if they're as close as you say I hope they'd respect that. But unfortunately something you have to learn to deal with is that the people you love are going to live their lives how they want, and sometimes that might terrify you, but it is their lives to live.", "It's okay for you to feel this way, you're just wanting to protect them. I'm not sure if you've considered talking to a therapist about this, but it might help to work through some of your anxiety.", "Wow idk why you got so bothered by my lack of actions. Would you hood your fianc\u00e9 hostage if they insisted on leaving? In a small paragraph I couldn\u2019t put alll the details but I think it\u2019s pretty clear that it wasn\u2019t a quick decision. We argued back and forth since 9 am in the morning. I was one person they were 4! I couldn\u2019t keep the keys and take them hostage against their will. Idk why us it so hard to comprehend that. Constantly they were telling me if they get fired from work or dropped from their clinicals I would be in fault. Everything is not black and white", "Yeah my car by my fianc\u00e9 was driving it. I\u2019m in general scared of freeways because i had a bad accident before. My fianc\u00e9 also had a really bad accident on the Angeles Crest highway again on a rainy day btw. So I didn\u2019t want them to go either j was worried for all if us.", "True! At the end of the day I can\u2019t prevent what\u2019s inevitable. If it\u2019s going to hap it will happen. On the 110W during our way back home we saw a pretty bad accident. The car was flipped and the back of it was completely destroyed. Their luggage and clothes were all over the freeway. I thought those people made the same decision as we did and that\u2019s what happened to them. I hope the people in that car made it out safely. That made me pretty scared and emotional.", "I used to be a park ranger, and we wouldn't close the park and leave work unless the wind was regularly at least 80 mph, which means we couldnt close the park and leave work unless there was an active hurricane. Now there were definitely times when the wind was 60+ that I would be turning away new visitors, because that's just ridiculous and not safe, but i could take ask people to leave. Once the entrance station had its windows blown in, but the wind wasn't 80 mph yet, so the park stayed open.", "That just seems unsafe for everyone", "Oh it absolutely was lol. But it was also a whole legal thing, and having rangers around was a must. You wouldn't believe how many people think hurricane weather is a good day to go kayaking/tubing. Those people were the majority of the people we'd turn away."]}
