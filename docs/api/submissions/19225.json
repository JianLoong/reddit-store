While it's nearly impossible for you to know all of the \"behind the scenes\" details between him and your mother, it was HIS responsibility to keep up the relationship, not the other way around.\n\nGrowing up, I had a great relationship with my mother's parents, and almost a non-existent one with my father's mother.  When I was in college, she once complained to my mother that I didn't speak to her much.  My mom asked if she had tried calling me. Silence.", "NTA \nAre you 18 or considered a legal adult where you live? If so your father can\u2019t tell you to move anywhere or make you sell the house. \n\nHe might be trying to force a relationship at best or trying to take the money from the sale of the home. \n\nI\u2019d call some lawyers before you let him do anything.", "My mom cheated on my dad over 30 years ago and it can still be problematic. I\u2019m not going to judge because you don\u2019t deserve it. The grief you are suffering is unimaginable. I\u2019m so sorry for your suffering. When the time feels right seek out some counseling to help you understand your grief and your feelings towards your father. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nThe fact is he choose to cheat and destroyed the family you had, and all the issues that may stem from that are his doing (trauma, bullying, ostracizing, etc...), it's not like he had an accident, cheating and moving away from your kid is a choice, regardless of the circumstances, he failed you. And you get to feel anyway you want about that, but maybe therapy would be of benefit, not to forgive him, you never need to do that if you don't want to, but to ignore maybe heal and move past from wounds that bring you unpleasant feelings.", "NTA. Actions have consequences and your anger at them is one of them. Having said that, I advise you to start therapy with a psychologist not so much for them or for the relationship with your father but more for yourself to shake off all this anger and live better", "NTA! \n\nAfter so many years, your dad doesn\u2019t sound like the type who will recognise his own mistakes and responsibilities. He deserved your yelling. Your step-mother, however. Was the SM aware that your dad was married when she started with him? If she wasn\u2019t aware, then I must say she\u2019s quite the MVP for hearing him talk shit about her (him saying he regretted their relationship) and also quietly absorbing your anger without retaliating back at you.", "NTA. If you're an adult do not move in with him, sell the house and follow your own life path. He chose to have an affair and move out of the country and is not respecting your clear wishes for him to remain out of your life. \n\nIf you're not an adult, do you have any other relatives you could live with instead? Especially given you'd have to move to a whole new country (which is certain to uproot your life) it's possible a judge would abide by your wishes and place you with a relative who is not your father. Or ask your mom's lawyer friend to recommend a lawyer to help you apply for emancipation so you can live independently.", "NTA. He made choices and is now trying to rewrite himself into more of a hero role. Your life was turned upside down when he left and now its in shambles due to your mother's death. Instead of trying to support you to work through your feelings he's making it seem like everyone else iced him out of a relationship.", "NAH. Of course you are resentful about the way your father treated your mother and, by extension, you. What your father did was wrong, but no one knows what goes on in another person's marriage--not even when those people are your parents. It sounds like your father feels bad about having an affair and how it affected his relationship with you. It also sounds like he loves you and wants to have a good relationship. Your stepmother sounds understanding. They both allowed you to vent.\n\nI hope you can talk to a professional who can help you sort out your feelings. Maybe you will never want to have a relationship with your father. Maybe you feel like you are betraying your mother if you do. \n\nFinally, I'm very sorry for your loss. You have not only lost your mother and uncle but your way of life. That's got to be terribly hard.", "First off, NTA. I'm approaching saying NAH because it's nobody's fault that your mother died and your father's cheating was years ago and he's clearly remorseful (remorse as in [remorse vs. guilt](https://www.brides.com/the-one-way-to-know-your-marriage-will-survive-an-affair-1102868#:~:text=To%20put%20it%20simply%2C%20remorse,over%20with%2C%22%20Fjelstad%20says), google it to see what I'm talking about, or just follow the link I added), but he hasn't come far enough because he's blaming your mother and clearly hasn't done enough to rebuild the bridge with you. And oh yeah, he cheated on your mom.\n\nBut second, family is in many ways the most precious resource any of us have. You learned that the hard way. If you want to forgive him and you're willing to put in the work, tell him you want family counseling. Your resentment is virtually hardwired at this point, so it's going to take work and time, but if you and your father can find your way back to a loving relationship, it's absolutely worth the work.\n\nAnd by the way, you wouldn't be disrespecting your mother's memory if you did this. Hopefully, she never actually told you to hate him forever. Often time, after the wounds have scarred over, cheated on spouses can even admit that the marriage was already f'd up. I don't know if that was the case with your parents, and it's NOT an excuse for the cheating, but understanding that helps humanize the cheater. Your dad probably wasn't evil, he was just a moron.\n\n(I'll tell you a little-known secret: people here on Reddit tend to descend on cheaters like a frenzy of piranha. It's actually not that often that cheaters turn out to be truly evil or irredeemable people. Most are just humans that made stupid, stupid, ssssssstupid mistakes. Which is what your father was acknowledging.)\n\nAll of that said, you have zero to feel guilty about. At the end of the day, your father cheated on your mother and by extension you. You have no obligation to mend fences. There's no obligation, but there are reasons to do it.\n\nIt's your call, just please don't ever consider yourself an AH for the fallout that was caused by the bomb that your father dropped.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He never took responsibility for his actions with either you or your mother so he doesn't get to just cry about it. Never feel guilty about that.", "I mean, on the subject of resenting him for cheating I'd say N T A, but that's not really the question here is it? It might be the title question, but this centers around how you dealt with that, which involved you eeves dropping on a conversation he was having with his wife where he was venting in private. \n\nYea, he put some of the blame of the situation on your late mom, and that's shitty, but he did also acknowledge that this was largely due to him cheating. More than that though, this was in private, and you proceeded to barge in, go on an unhinged tyrade, and tell him you wished he'd died. Like, I get that you're grieving, but that's still demented. \n\nSo, ESH for that particular conflict in specific. Him for still lumping some of the blame onto your mother, you for literally wishing death on him because of something you chose to listen in on. You clearly need therapy of some variety.", "Not sure what country you are in, or the laws there, so I will just say that  a lot of places 18 is an adult and you don't have to do what he says.  You have a right to your feelings.   If you are legally independent, grief counseling is first, then go through her stuff and determine what you want to keep, donate (we donated my mom's nice clothes to an organization that helps abused women to get back in the workforce), determine how much you will have after selling the house and make a plan.  I assume you have friends where you are, and they are important.   \n\nThat give you the ability to determine if staying with him, with your money in accounts he can't touch, or if you want to go to university and maybe share living space with a friend to reduce expenses, etc..  NTA", "ESH. \n\nYour dad shouldn\u2019t have cheated. He should have filed for divorce before moving on to someone else. He\u2019s an AH for that. \n\nYou can be upset with him. You can process the grief over your mom and uncle however you need to. But, bursting in on what was a private conversation and wishing death upon your father was very extreme. \n\nThere\u2019s obviously a lot that needs worked out between the two of you and counseling would likely be beneficial, because holding things in and then letting it all out out of anger rather than in a productive conversation isn\u2019t a healthy coping mechanism.", "How about no one is the AH. You dad was a shitty dad. But you dont know what went on in his marriage to your mom. And you havent been around him much to develop ANY kind of relationship, good or bad. And you are grieving the only family you knew and now had to start over. Your dad is having a hard time because you two arent close. Big emotions for everyone. He didnt know you were listening. And spouces vent to each other. Try finding a middle ground. Tell him how you feel (calmly) and ask him about his feelings. See if there is somewhere for you to meet in the middle and start a new and different relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr you can tell him to f off and be miseralbe with no family the rest of your life", "NTA. However I will chime in with it sounds like you may need some therapy. Stuff like that can really affect you and your psyche in a negative way. Don't let it consume you. No one can force you to get therapy but I would recommend it.", "NTa. You are allowed to be mad for what you experienced and your dad basically abandoning you, but you don't know what their adult relationship was like. You will find that they are complicated. Still, NTA for any of your anger, especially about having to leave your home. That would suck.", "NTA. He wanted your mother, who he cheated on and abandoned, to encourage you to like him more??? How dare he even say her name right now! It is okay that you let it all out, and then you let him know that sound travels and you do, in fact, have ears. \n\nI am so sorry about your mother's passing. I know how horrible it is to suddenly lose your parent. Wishing death on someone is never a good look, so maybe consider apologizing about that part, while also saying that he should never ever blame your mother for *any aspect* of the consequences of his own infidelity again. You two have a long road ahead and you're deeply grieving. You will need to give each other a lot of space for a while.", "Unfortunately I\u2019m still 17, I won\u2019t be 18 until December\u2026", "As far as I know she knew about the marriage. My father was an ambassador and my SM a newish hire being that it was an office job and my mother has hanged out with my fathers colleagues before I would assume she knew about the marriage.

They\u2019ve always been welcoming to me though, never missing a birthday gift or Christmas gift or even Easter chocolate despite living continents away. Perhaps a life with them would be easier than this one.", "My mother has never once bad mouthed my father, at least not to me. She always encouraged I keep the relationship between him and I and assured me more times than I could count that I wouldn\u2019t be betraying her. In all honestly I know I\u2019m not betraying her by forgiving him but I just can\u2019t seem to get passed the blind rage I feel about everything, especially in those early years after the divorce when he was happy, whilst my mother was miserable. I do hate how he treated my mother but I also hate how he treated me. At the end of the day the way I see it is that his pleasure was worth more than our relationship. \n\nI\u2019m hoping things will settle soon although I\u2019m not hopeful as most of my time is spent alone, everyone here suggests therapy I can\u2019t say I have that kind of money from my previous part time jobs and I hate to ask my father\u2026we\u2019ll see how it turns out tbh.", "If OP was 12 six years ago, they would be 18 now.", "Honestly the only reason I burst in was because I couldn\u2019t stand him blaming my mother about not pushing a relationship between my father and I. Little did he know my mother never stopped pushing a relationship between us, she always encouraged me and assured me I was still his daughter despite feeling like I had been replaced. My mother was nothing but kind even after he cheated and he had the audacity to think otherwise really pushed me over the edge, wishing on his death was a huge blunder on my part I do admit to that.", "I\u2019m 17 and I won\u2019t be 18 for a little while, I skipped a grade when I was younger and I was planning on using my now free time to work and save up for university, my father has already helped package and ship my mother\u2019s belongings, they should be arriving soon and with the now big bedroom I have plenty of space for her things, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll ever open them but at least they\u2019d be with me. As for the house, my mothers lawyer is dealing with sale, he\u2019s a close family friend so he\u2019s going to keep me updated about it.\n\nI\u2019ve never considered therapy I\u2019m not going to lie, my country although is a massive tourist attraction does have its poorer parts which is where I was from, in my countryside village people didn\u2019t really see therapists we often had physical problems to worry about and our mental issues we pushed to the side, It was the cultural norm. Although judging by these comments I now see how helpful a therapist might have been when I was younger\u2026I\u2019ve only ever complained about my crap to my friend and my uncle, I couldn\u2019t bare to talk to my mother knowing the pain he had caused her. I just didn\u2019t want to remind her.", "People tend to be really, mindblowingly good at only hearing what they want to hear if there is any wiggle room at all. So, hearing it from your own, almost adult, child, at high decibels, repeatedly, for a *long time* so you know damned well that it's not just a brief tantrum, that this is very real, with such intensity that it leaves you sobbing in your new spouse's arms, with the message being that you have destroyed your relationship with them and that your child legitimately wishes that you had been the one to die?\n\n\nMaybe...maybe that's a good start. Force dad to take this seriously. People genuinely don't learn and don't change until there's blood on the ground and tears on the wind.", "Depending on where you live you may be able to go to court and get independent status. That would mean you would be able to go and live where you please, including the country you used to live in, but that probably also means that you may not be entitled to any help from your father.", "I meant to type five years ago but can\u2019t edit now, I\u2019m 17 so I\u2019m still not a legal adult but I\u2019ll be 18 in December.", "This. If there are laws that allow it in your country apply for independent status. You don't want to live with your father, the resentment will only get worse and worse and you'll be in a foreign country cut off from everyone you know."]}
