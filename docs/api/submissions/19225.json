When I was in college, she once complained to my mother that I didn't speak to her much.  My mom asked if she had tried calling me.

And you get to feel anyway you want about that, but maybe therapy would be of benefit, not to forgive him, you never need to do that if you don't want to, but to ignore maybe heal and move past from wounds that bring you unpleasant feelings.", "NTA. Actions have consequences and your anger at them is one of them. Having said that, I advise you to start therapy with a psychologist not so much for them or for the relationship with your father but more for yourself to shake off all this anger and live better", "NTA! \n\nAfter so many years, your dad doesn\u2019t sound like the type who will recognise his own mistakes and responsibilities. He deserved your yelling. Your step-mother, however. Was the SM aware that your dad was married when she started with him? If she wasn\u2019t aware, then I must say she\u2019s quite the MVP for hearing him talk shit about her (him saying he regretted their relationship) and also quietly absorbing your anger without retaliating back at you.", "NTA. If you're an adult do not move in with him, sell the house and follow your own life path. He chose to have an affair and move out of the country and is not respecting your clear wishes for him to remain out of your life. \n\nIf you're not an adult, do you have any other relatives you could live with instead? Especially given you'd have to move to a whole new country (which is certain to uproot your life) it's possible a judge would abide by your wishes and place you with a relative who is not your father. Or ask your mom's lawyer friend to recommend a lawyer to help you apply for emancipation so you can live independently.", "NTA. He made choices and is now trying to rewrite himself into more of a hero role. Your life was turned upside down when he left and now its in shambles due to your mother's death. Instead of trying to support you to work through your feelings he's making it seem like everyone else iced him out of a relationship.", "NAH. Of course you are resentful about the way your father treated your mother and, by extension, you. What your father did was wrong, but no one knows what goes on in another person's marriage--not even when those people are your parents. It sounds like your father feels bad about having an affair and how it affected his relationship with you. It also sounds like he loves you and wants to have a good relationship. Your stepmother sounds understanding. They both allowed you to vent.\n\nI hope you can talk to a professional who can help you sort out your feelings. Maybe you will never want to have a relationship with your father. Maybe you feel like you are betraying your mother if you do. \n\nFinally, I'm very sorry for your loss. You have not only lost your mother and uncle but your way of life. That's got to be terribly hard.", "First off, NTA. I'm approaching saying NAH because it's nobody's fault that your mother died and your father's cheating was years ago and he's clearly remorseful (remorse as in [remorse vs. guilt](https://www.brides.com/the-one-way-to-know-your-marriage-will-survive-an-affair-1102868#:~:text=To%20put%20it%20simply%2C%20remorse,over%20with%2C%22%20Fjelstad%20says), google it to see what I'm talking about, or just follow the link I added), but he hasn't come far enough because he's blaming your mother and clearly hasn't done enough to rebuild the bridge with you. And oh yeah, he cheated on your mom.\n\nBut second, family is in many ways the most precious resource any of us have. You learned that the hard way. If you want to forgive him and you're willing to put in the work, tell him you want family counseling. Your resentment is virtually hardwired at this point, so it's going to take work and time, but if you and your father can find your way back to a loving relationship, it's absolutely worth the work.\n\nAnd by the way, you wouldn't be disrespecting your mother's memory if you did this. Hopefully, she never actually told you to hate him forever. Often time, after the wounds have scarred over, cheated on spouses can even admit that the marriage was already f'd up. I don't know if that was the case with your parents, and it's NOT an excuse for the cheating, but understanding that helps humanize the cheater. Your dad probably wasn't evil, he was just a moron.\n\n(I'll tell you a little-known secret: people here on Reddit tend to descend on cheaters like a frenzy of piranha. It's actually not that often that cheaters turn out to be truly evil or irredeemable people. Most are just humans that made stupid, stupid, ssssssstupid mistakes. Which is what your father was acknowledging.)\n\nAll of that said, you have zero to feel guilty about. At the end of the day, your father cheated on your mother and by extension you. You have no obligation to mend fences. There's no obligation, but there are reasons to do it.\n\nIt's your call, just please don't ever consider yourself an AH for the fallout that was caused by the bomb that your father dropped.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It might be the title question, but this centers around how you dealt with that, which involved you eeves dropping on a conversation he was having with his wife where he was venting in private. \n\nYea, he put some of the blame of the situation on your late mom, and that's shitty, but he did also acknowledge that this was largely due to him cheating. More than that though, this was in private, and you proceeded to barge in, go on an unhinged tyrade, and tell him you wished he'd died.

You have a right to your feelings.   If you are legally independent, grief counseling is first, then go through her stuff and determine what you want to keep, donate (we donated my mom's nice clothes to an organization that helps abused women to get back in the workforce), determine how much you will have after selling the house and make a plan.  I assume you have friends where you are, and they are important.   \n\nThat give you the ability to determine if staying with him, with your money in accounts he can't touch, or if you want to go to university and maybe share living space with a friend to reduce expenses, etc..

You can process the grief over your mom and uncle however you need to. But, bursting in on what was a private conversation and wishing death upon your father was very extreme. \n\nThere\u2019s obviously a lot that needs worked out between the two of you and counseling would likely be beneficial, because holding things in and then letting it all out out of anger rather than in a productive conversation isn\u2019t a healthy coping mechanism.", "How about no one is the AH. You dad was a shitty dad. But you dont know what went on in his marriage to your mom. And you havent been around him much to develop ANY kind of relationship, good or bad. And you are grieving the only family you knew and now had to start over. Your dad is having a hard time because you two arent close. Big emotions for everyone. He didnt know you were listening.

How dare he even say her name right now! It is okay that you let it all out, and then you let him know that sound travels and you do, in fact, have ears. \n\nI am so sorry about your mother's passing. I know how horrible it is to suddenly lose your parent. Wishing death on someone is never a good look, so maybe consider apologizing about that part, while also saying that he should never ever blame your mother for *any aspect* of the consequences of his own infidelity again.

Little did he know my mother never stopped pushing a relationship between us, she always encouraged me and assured me I was still his daughter despite feeling like I had been replaced.

Although judging by these comments I now see how helpful a therapist might have been when I was younger\u2026I\u2019ve only ever complained about my crap to my friend and my uncle, I couldn\u2019t bare to talk to my mother knowing the pain he had caused her.

If there are laws that allow it in your country apply for independent status.

It's actually good to resent and judge our parents for their really shitty behavior, so we don't internalize and rationalize it ourselves, repeating the pattern when we're older. Some of the worst people I've ever known had shitty parents that they thought were pretty swell, so they were just like them in all the worst ways.", "NTA. I had a dad who was crappy in a couple spectacular ways. I learned that the connection someone has to their dad is separate from whether you like or respect that person. It's OK to resent parents who have earned it. \n\nBlaming your deceased mom in a way that you could hear is a real low blow, even if he's factually correct. Not cool. He switched teams, you never left the team that he ditched. He's allowed to vent about his old team, but he's got to respect that doing so well still feel like your team he's disrespecting. \n\nI suggest being open to the idea that you only know part of the story. That said, you're not wrong to feel the way you do. I think you're on 100% solid ground to ask that he not disrespect your mother in any way that would get back to you. That's the absolute minimum first step to him starting to earn your trust. He can think however he wants about your mom, he needs to acknowledge how hurtful it is to you for him to do that around you. \n\nMany people will suggest you allow him to earn your trust. You decide whether you want that to happen. Until he's earned it, your resentment is fully justified.", "NTA.

He had perfect control of his actions and the action was cheating and hurting your mom. You have every right to be angry and a bit spiteful for that. \n\nAs much as you have in your plate right now I suggest therapy and maybe seeing if someone else can take you in; grandparent or an aunt or something?

Tell him what you're feeling and what you've felt for the past 6 years, in a way that can be heard better than yelling. Tell him what you want in terms of your living situation.

You sound unhinged and yes a lot of stuff has happened to you but if you don\u2019t fix yourself now you\u2019re going to fuck up your adulthood.\n\nAlso like be smarter and learn how to self regulate", "Honest questions, passing no judgement. The sooner you realize that being an adult means you act as your own parent, in your own best interest, the better. You're your agent here, you need to ask yourself what you want out of the situation.\n\nI'm one of the few ones here who will tell you that the more time you spend harboring PAST hurts is not going to accomplish anything but throw good time after bad in the PRESENT. I don't care about justifying your anger, I wonder what purpose it serves and what you want to get out of this? To be the victim? No? Do you want to have a loving father? \n\nOr do you want to hurt him like he hurt you? What do you want out of the present situation?\n\nWe cannot change the past, none of us. Not him, not her, not you.\n\nWhat matters is what you do in this PRESENT moment. Do you want to lose your dad? Punish him? Get him to apologize? Are you conflicted about your loyalty to your mom? \n\nKeep a journal that NOBODY can get to, it will help you gather your thoughts and clarify for yourself what you want out of the situation.  I hope you take this opportunity to learn to walk into every situation in life with intent, moving forwards to what you want to get out of it and learn from it.", "it's also ok if you never forgive him. really, it is. other commenters make the argument that he made a stupid mistake, but he actually consciously made several mistakes, over and over. you're absolutely right that he prioritised his pleasure over you and your family.", "And then complain to his then mistress about it as if it wasn't his own choices, in hearing distance.", "All of this. OP, You\u2019ve been through two huge, awful life events one after the other: the loss of your mom and having to move to another country with people you deeply resent. Please ask your dad to pay for therapy.", "COMPLAINED TO HIS MISTRESS ABOUT HIS DEAD EX WIFE WHILE HIS DAUGHTER WAS IN THE OTHER ROOM!\n\nsorry for the caps but seriously, this is not a good man", "This. If you move countries when your kid is justifiably upset you, idk, broke up the entire family...of course they won't take your calls? This was totally foreseeable behavior. If he truly cared about the relationship he would have stayed accessible to OP physically and tried to make ammends.", "Aren\u2019t children of American citizens American? It sounds like her dad was originally from the states.", "He was not allowed to vent where you could hear.  \n\nNTA but get some therapy.  The anger's hurting you more than anyone.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA, he should have made you his number one priority instead of ignoring you and solely focusing on SM and SS. I'm sorry for your loss and hope that you find happiness.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your dad messed up everyone's life with his affair, and you're still reeling from the shock and grief of losing your mom and uncle.  Having said that, you *do* need help...at 18, you're ill-equipped to deal with life's challenges.  Let your dad help you, but remind him that you're an adult who should not be condescended to.", "It's a rough time. You're grueving, and hrs actually being faced with his mistakes and beating himself up. \n\nNo assholes here. Just two hurting people who lost each other and also need each other. \n\nI hope yoi all get some grief and family counseling", "NTA. It wasn't your mother's responsibility to foster your dad's relationship with you, that was his responsibility and any failure in that department is on him. With your mother passing away so shortly before he implied her irresponsibility in this area, it's no wonder you blew up. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA, you lost your mother and uncle.You're worried about having to go to a new country with your father you're angry at and the woman he cheated with and married. What you said wasn't kind but it is understandable. That's a ton of stress.\nI know this sounds a bit calculating but it would probably make your life easier to try to rebuild your relationships with your dad and your grandparents. Life is full of ups and downs and it really helps to have someone who cares about you in your corner willing to do what they can to help.\nIf you don't feel like you can live with your father and his wife emotionally, ask if you can stay with your grandparents until you're an adult. Since your father is an ambassador, he probably has decent insurance that covers therapy. Talk to him about going to counseling for the loss of your mom/uncle and for the two of you to have a better relationship. It sounds like he really wants that.", "This is gonna sound weird but, yta. That's stress you don't need to be living with.", "NTA.  You're still grieving your mother and uncle, and you've had your life uprooted, so you're in a very emotional and fragile state.  Also, I feel a lot of what you said and how you said it was six years of upset coming out at once, and you probably wished you could have said some of that years ago but were too young to understand how to express yourself.", "NTA", "My husband's dad cheated because his mom was genuinely abusive and it felt like it was his only out without losing his kids completely, which you can understand within 3 hours of having met his mom. He showed up - dude only had weekends and was there for the 8 hour round-trip every weekend. He financially provided without complaint for anything the kids felt they needed to succeed- sports, clubs, tutoring, etc. The grandparents, while not great at calling, still showed for anything the kids needed up to their weddings, where they each spent 100k except my husband who was aligned with my poor sensibilities. \n\nThey're my examples for what divorce could be like, and the true definitions of 'if they wanted to, they would'.", "He didn't make anyone sell the house. It was what the mother's Will dictated.", "Then he needed to try harder. I spent 6 months refusing to speak to my Dad because I was angry at him (parents divorced, Dad had cheated though he didn't marry the affair partner). He came to my mum's house every day, tried to start a conversation. He wrote me letters. He apologised. He came to every school event, he funded my art classes. He took me horse riding and paid for it and stood there and watched while having an allergic reaction every time. And it was a spectacular reaction. I PUNISHED him. And he NEVER gave up. OP's Dad made his priorities clear. He didn't try hard enough.", "Trying , is not leaving the vicinity of direct and easy access to your children. Idgaf I would go to the ends of the earth , give up everything and everyone to be with my child. A good parent would never even consider this kind of distance from their child.", "Call me a pessimist but if I didn\u2019t see the will myself I\u2019d wonder if that was the case. \n\nYou have to be a truly selfish person to abandon a child then have the audacity to be upset when they don\u2019t want a relationship with you. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t put it past someone like that to lie about the will and at best put the money in a trust that they use to control OP for the foreseeable future.", "Are you not getting money from the sale of the house? Will that not pay for next steps? Take care.", "You don\u2019t feel like you can get past the rage right now probably because up until now, you haven\u2019t had the opportunity to say what you needed to say to your father. You kept a lid on everything you\u2019ve been feeling for the past 6 years and then are having to deal with the tragedy of loosing your mother and uncle. You\u2019ve had your entire life uprooted again. It should be a surprise to no one that you\u2019ve finally let it out. I\u2019m glad you did. For your sake. It\u2019s not healthy to keep everything in for so long. \n\nDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself OP. \n\nNTA", "OP I would definitely try to do this, or work out an arrangement if a friend's family will take you in, especially if you are in school."]}
