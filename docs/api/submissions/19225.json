When I was in college, she once complained to my mother that I didn't speak to her much.  My mom asked if she had tried calling me.

And you get to feel anyway you want about that, but maybe therapy would be of benefit, not to forgive him, you never need to do that if you don't want to, but to ignore maybe heal and move past from wounds that bring you unpleasant feelings.", "NTA. Actions have consequences and your anger at them is one of them. Having said that, I advise you to start therapy with a psychologist not so much for them or for the relationship with your father but more for yourself to shake off all this anger and live better", "NTA! \n\nAfter so many years, your dad doesn\u2019t sound like the type who will recognise his own mistakes and responsibilities. He deserved your yelling. Your step-mother, however. Was the SM aware that your dad was married when she started with him? If she wasn\u2019t aware, then I must say she\u2019s quite the MVP for hearing him talk shit about her (him saying he regretted their relationship) and also quietly absorbing your anger without retaliating back at you.", "NTA. If you're an adult do not move in with him, sell the house and follow your own life path. He chose to have an affair and move out of the country and is not respecting your clear wishes for him to remain out of your life. \n\nIf you're not an adult, do you have any other relatives you could live with instead? Especially given you'd have to move to a whole new country (which is certain to uproot your life) it's possible a judge would abide by your wishes and place you with a relative who is not your father. Or ask your mom's lawyer friend to recommend a lawyer to help you apply for emancipation so you can live independently.", "NTA. He made choices and is now trying to rewrite himself into more of a hero role. Your life was turned upside down when he left and now its in shambles due to your mother's death. Instead of trying to support you to work through your feelings he's making it seem like everyone else iced him out of a relationship.", "NAH. Of course you are resentful about the way your father treated your mother and, by extension, you. What your father did was wrong, but no one knows what goes on in another person's marriage--not even when those people are your parents. It sounds like your father feels bad about having an affair and how it affected his relationship with you. It also sounds like he loves you and wants to have a good relationship. Your stepmother sounds understanding. They both allowed you to vent.\n\nI hope you can talk to a professional who can help you sort out your feelings. Maybe you will never want to have a relationship with your father. Maybe you feel like you are betraying your mother if you do. \n\nFinally, I'm very sorry for your loss. You have not only lost your mother and uncle but your way of life. That's got to be terribly hard.", "First off, NTA. I'm approaching saying NAH because it's nobody's fault that your mother died and your father's cheating was years ago and he's clearly remorseful (remorse as in [remorse vs. guilt](https://www.brides.com/the-one-way-to-know-your-marriage-will-survive-an-affair-1102868#:~:text=To%20put%20it%20simply%2C%20remorse,over%20with%2C%22%20Fjelstad%20says), google it to see what I'm talking about, or just follow the link I added), but he hasn't come far enough because he's blaming your mother and clearly hasn't done enough to rebuild the bridge with you. And oh yeah, he cheated on your mom.\n\nBut second, family is in many ways the most precious resource any of us have. You learned that the hard way. If you want to forgive him and you're willing to put in the work, tell him you want family counseling. Your resentment is virtually hardwired at this point, so it's going to take work and time, but if you and your father can find your way back to a loving relationship, it's absolutely worth the work.\n\nAnd by the way, you wouldn't be disrespecting your mother's memory if you did this. Hopefully, she never actually told you to hate him forever. Often time, after the wounds have scarred over, cheated on spouses can even admit that the marriage was already f'd up. I don't know if that was the case with your parents, and it's NOT an excuse for the cheating, but understanding that helps humanize the cheater. Your dad probably wasn't evil, he was just a moron.\n\n(I'll tell you a little-known secret: people here on Reddit tend to descend on cheaters like a frenzy of piranha. It's actually not that often that cheaters turn out to be truly evil or irredeemable people. Most are just humans that made stupid, stupid, ssssssstupid mistakes. Which is what your father was acknowledging.)\n\nAll of that said, you have zero to feel guilty about. At the end of the day, your father cheated on your mother and by extension you. You have no obligation to mend fences. There's no obligation, but there are reasons to do it.\n\nIt's your call, just please don't ever consider yourself an AH for the fallout that was caused by the bomb that your father dropped.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It might be the title question, but this centers around how you dealt with that, which involved you eeves dropping on a conversation he was having with his wife where he was venting in private. \n\nYea, he put some of the blame of the situation on your late mom, and that's shitty, but he did also acknowledge that this was largely due to him cheating. More than that though, this was in private, and you proceeded to barge in, go on an unhinged tyrade, and tell him you wished he'd died.

You have a right to your feelings.   If you are legally independent, grief counseling is first, then go through her stuff and determine what you want to keep, donate (we donated my mom's nice clothes to an organization that helps abused women to get back in the workforce), determine how much you will have after selling the house and make a plan.  I assume you have friends where you are, and they are important.   \n\nThat give you the ability to determine if staying with him, with your money in accounts he can't touch, or if you want to go to university and maybe share living space with a friend to reduce expenses, etc..

You can process the grief over your mom and uncle however you need to. But, bursting in on what was a private conversation and wishing death upon your father was very extreme. \n\nThere\u2019s obviously a lot that needs worked out between the two of you and counseling would likely be beneficial, because holding things in and then letting it all out out of anger rather than in a productive conversation isn\u2019t a healthy coping mechanism.", "How about no one is the AH. You dad was a shitty dad. But you dont know what went on in his marriage to your mom. And you havent been around him much to develop ANY kind of relationship, good or bad. And you are grieving the only family you knew and now had to start over. Your dad is having a hard time because you two arent close. Big emotions for everyone. He didnt know you were listening.

How dare he even say her name right now! It is okay that you let it all out, and then you let him know that sound travels and you do, in fact, have ears. \n\nI am so sorry about your mother's passing. I know how horrible it is to suddenly lose your parent. Wishing death on someone is never a good look, so maybe consider apologizing about that part, while also saying that he should never ever blame your mother for *any aspect* of the consequences of his own infidelity again.

Little did he know my mother never stopped pushing a relationship between us, she always encouraged me and assured me I was still his daughter despite feeling like I had been replaced.

Although judging by these comments I now see how helpful a therapist might have been when I was younger\u2026I\u2019ve only ever complained about my crap to my friend and my uncle, I couldn\u2019t bare to talk to my mother knowing the pain he had caused her.

If there are laws that allow it in your country apply for independent status.

It's actually good to resent and judge our parents for their really shitty behavior, so we don't internalize and rationalize it ourselves, repeating the pattern when we're older. Some of the worst people I've ever known had shitty parents that they thought were pretty swell, so they were just like them in all the worst ways.", "NTA. I had a dad who was crappy in a couple spectacular ways. I learned that the connection someone has to their dad is separate from whether you like or respect that person. It's OK to resent parents who have earned it. \n\nBlaming your deceased mom in a way that you could hear is a real low blow, even if he's factually correct. Not cool. He switched teams, you never left the team that he ditched. He's allowed to vent about his old team, but he's got to respect that doing so well still feel like your team he's disrespecting. \n\nI suggest being open to the idea that you only know part of the story. That said, you're not wrong to feel the way you do. I think you're on 100% solid ground to ask that he not disrespect your mother in any way that would get back to you. That's the absolute minimum first step to him starting to earn your trust. He can think however he wants about your mom, he needs to acknowledge how hurtful it is to you for him to do that around you. \n\nMany people will suggest you allow him to earn your trust. You decide whether you want that to happen. Until he's earned it, your resentment is fully justified.", "NTA.

He had perfect control of his actions and the action was cheating and hurting your mom. You have every right to be angry and a bit spiteful for that. \n\nAs much as you have in your plate right now I suggest therapy and maybe seeing if someone else can take you in; grandparent or an aunt or something?

You're grieving, and you're rightfully angry about how his choices upended your life and hurt someone you cared about very much, and you're allowed to express that anger to the person who hurt you and who is once again trying to upend your life.\n\nI would suggest, though, trying to sit down with your father and have a genuine, meaningful talk once you feel you're in the place to do so. Tell him what you're feeling and what you've felt for the past 6 years, in a way that can be heard better than yelling. Tell him what you want in terms of your living situation.

Your anger and resentment sounds justified.  \n\nDid what you said hurt his feelings?  Probably.  It\u2019s probably not close to the emotional turmoil you and your mother went through though.  He had two jobs: be a husband and father and it sounds like he failed at both.  When he\u2019s ready to apologize you can start to forgive him but at this point I\u2019m not seeing any real remorse on his part for his actions.", "> and often ignored his calls and messages\n\nthis sounds like he was trying", "What hero role? It doesn't sound as if he is trying to do anything of the sort.", "I agree with this. Ops resentment is fully justified but they now live in a world where this man is their only living parent. Now, when full of grief and anger, might not be the right time to slam the door completely. OP mentioned maybe living with their paternal grandparents- maybe a bit of space would make it easier.", "IDK how you can say NAH on this one. The cheating dad is the whole reason for this mess.", "He was venting something based on his assumptions about what the deceased did or didn\u2019t do.\n\nHis dad cheated, got a divorce, and left the country with his girlfriend.  But he has the audacity to say that he wishes OPs mom had done more to encourage the relationship when he has no idea what she did to encourage the relationship?  Bonkers.  Bonkers.\n\nEven then, he\u2019s regretful about how his relationship with stepmom got started, not the fact of the relationship.  I\u2019m pretty sure that moving to another country discouraged his relationship with his son pretty thoroughly even if he hadn\u2019t cheated.", "He cheated. He moved to a different country. He made it so all they had was phone calls. \n\nOP was a child whose parents had betrayed them and then up and left them to play happy families. \n\nHe didn\u2019t try hard enough. It took him six years and being in forced contact with his child to regret those decisions.", "Look, OP, you are going to get a lot of comments about how your are completely in the right and your father is a monster for cheating and deserves anything you throw at him. And maybe he does, but that doesn't actually help you at all right now. You will be 18 in a few months and I assume you will have some inheritance money. If you don't actually want a relationship with your father, try for polite indifference for the sort time you will have to live in his home. Focus on  dealing with your grief and making plans for your future, instead of attacking your father. It's not going to make you feel any better, and it sounds as if he already realizes he was in the wrong and that it has cost him a relationship with his child.", "He's saying that it's not his and his swinging dick's fault that he and OP don't have a relationship, he's blaming it on the dead mum, saying she should have encouraged contact more. OP has said that their mum did in fact encourage contact and it was their choice, so dad is talking out of his ass and blaming the dead for the repercussions of his affair", "Your SM sounds kind of trashy. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. NTA at all, and please continue to tell them how their disgusting actions impacted you and destroyed your family.", "Hey OP, can you start arrangements to go back on the day you turn 18? Or do you want to stay in the US? Your mother's stuff is being shipped but can you put it in storage so if you want to leave, you can just ship it back and cut off your father? You can use the money from the sale of the house to do that. And even find a place to get an apartment or rent something and start working when you go back. What options do you have? Instead of fuming, you can think of the next thing to do. If you don't want your father in your life then take steps to achieve that. If your mental health is only going to worsen if he's there, then best to leave him in December so you can focus on grieving properly. NTA But start planning NOW. Gather your important documents and keep them somewhere safe so your father can't hold them against you and prevent you from leaving. Passports, license, birth certificate, etc.", "Look, if your dad is any kind of decent person, *and* if you put the fear of god into him with that tongue lashing, then asking him to help you seek therapy for help with:\n\n- The grief of your mother's passing \n\n- The shakeup of your life and the move and everything that just happened\n\n- Your own longstanding resentment of what he did\n\n...that's a chance to be a good father which he should leap at.\n\nAlso, I'm so sorry for your loss. Don't force yourself to either put the grief down prematurely, nor carry it forever. You'll be ok, even if there are bad days along the path.", "If you were at the top of a mountain and you called down to your father that you would go to family therapy if he paid for you to go to individual therapy first, and then you held out your hand indicating that he had to put the money in your hand, my bet is that he would literally climb the tallest mountain for that chance. \n\nI don't know this. I'm gambling based on the scene that you described of him berating himself and then crying when you admonished him (again, don't waste time feeling bad about that). But DO NOT let money get in the way if your father is willing to pay. I say it that way because I never thought to ask if he is open to therapy. Also, are you sure your insurance doesn't cover it?\n\nBy the way, as I hinted above and also forgot to include in my first comment, you should do individual therapy first, then family therapy. The stuff you mentioned in your first paragraph. That is without a doubt the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the long list of things that you're angry about. Individual therapy has to come first because family therapy doesn't work well when you're seething with anger (even if it's justifiable, which it is). \n\nMy ultimate gamble is that the father you remember from before he cheated is still there and reaching out to you to take his hand and pull him back. I don't know if that would ultimately be what's best for you. But I hope so because of what I said before, about family being the most precious commodity there is. \n\nInfinite internet hugz, OP. If you're up for it, post an update in a few months or whenever. I don't know why for sure, maybe because of parallels to my life, but your post really hit me in the feels. I very much would like to hear how you're doing down the road.    :)", "It sounds like even with the move he tried to keep in contact, both physically and over the phone (OP mentioned him traveling to visit alone).\n\nNot to defend a cheater, but it sounds like he at least tried. OP's not the AH for not wanting a relationship, especially now that they're 18, but I don't think you can say he didn't try.", "It's June now. It's highly unlikely that it's worth it to pursue this, even assuming emancipation is a possibility and a financially realistic solution.", "But she won't be entitled to help in 6 months anyways.", "Meh. He moved to a different country and left his child in an impoverished neighborhood (she talks about therapy not being a thing in their poor community) - aka he put his wants and comforts FAR above that of his child. \n\nHe didn\u2019t try that hard. He didn\u2019t try hard enough to be sure his kids got the kind of child support that got her out of that neighborhood, though he could afford American suburbia for himself. \n\nHe didn\u2019t try hard enough to even just\u2026 stay in the same country as his child. \n\nHe didn\u2019t try hard enough to even know his ex WAS advocating for him\u2026 so he blasted the dead mom now. \n\nNah. He fucked up. Made a series of selfish decisions. Then half-assed everything because his own comfort was at his forefront. \n\nAnd now he only regrets it because the consequences are living in his comfortable house and impeding his happy life with the guilt and shame he deserves.\n\nI\u2019ve got no grade for cheaters OR selfish, absentee parents.", "If it is an option where OP lives, she can start the process and ask for protection against being moved while it is pending. Most places this would be decided very quickly given the circumstances.\n\nEven if the petition is rendered moot by her turning 18, she will have avoided her father taking control of her and her assets during the 6 months.", "I'd say it's worth it to go to court just to avoid getting stranded in a foreign country. OP may not be able to legally work in the US depending on her citizenship, which means no income and no support network to help her, which might make it very hard for her to get out as soon as she's 18.", "If you're an adult do not move in with him, sell the house and follow your own life path.NAT"]}
