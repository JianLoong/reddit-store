{"id": 28254, "submission_id": "16zxpzz", "title": "AITA The Giving Tree", "selftext": "As long as my daughter (26) Holly attended college, I (ancient) told her she could live in my (former) rental house and I would pay for food, clothing, car, car insurance, telephone, college, all the utility bills, plus property taxes and insurance (as well as forego the rental income).\n\nAfter a few years, Holly moved in her boyfriend Josh (27) (without asking but I also didn't object) and his sweet enormous dog. The house is located near his job. For over three years now, I have paid for everything other than wifi, which Josh pays for, plus he mows the lawn every so often. Josh also uses the backyard to repair cars and things on the side (although this is a subdivision and not allowed to) so the backyard is full of parts. I have been very good to both of them - whenever I am in their town (2 hrs away), I treat them to dinner. I initially gave the boyfriend both birthday gifts and Christmas presents but after a few years noticed I never received even a text on my birthday so stopped giving presents as well. I like the guy - he's smart, a hard-worker (on his things), participates in my daughter's interests, is creative, etc. However, I get the impression the feeling isn't mutual.\n\nWhen Josh first moved in, I said to my daughter that he needed to contribute to the rent. Holly said he had bad credit, was going through a divorce, and couldn't pay anything as he had to pay his debts, so she refused to ask him. I thought at the time he ought to pay something and stopped giving my daughter food and run around money. I thought either he'd at least kick in for food (or refuse to) and/or she'd get tired of asking for money and would either see that he pays some rent - or she would maybe get a part time job, which many college students do. He now covers her food and spending money. \n\nLong story short, I'm temporarily not in the same financial situation - was sick two years plus job change at lower pay. I explained to Holly I can't currently continue to pay everything even though she is still studying - and I'd like her boyfriend to kick in some money temporarily plus she needs to get a part time job.  They're upset at me that I asked them to pay some of their bills. I also gave them a list of expectations about the house, as it's a complete mess. I've asked them for years to keep the house and yard clean and in shape. (The neighbors got so tired of the weeds she had her landscaper mulch and plant flowers.) I wrote a list on paper and told them they had three weeks to clean the house, fix a broken shutter, pull weeds, etc.  They aren't happy. \n\nHere's the thing, I don't mind paying - my parents were generous but we also worked together - I was generous back and would help them out when they needed it. In this situation, I feel like the giving tree - I just can't do it anymore. Am I the ass?  \n\nPlease don't go by my karma pts! Had a car accident not my fault. Complained loudly about the guy's insurance co. and they paid this guy to repeat ding me! \n\nThank you! \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1696451379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zxpzz/aita_the_giving_tree/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then they would already be used to adulting and you would have a cashpile to use towards the home. I would flat start eviction proceedings at this point because they don\u2019t get to be ticked at their landlord and they shouldn\u2019t be with you. Sincerely, someone whose husbands family is also \u201coh but you gotta take care of family\u201d\u2026 no you don\u2019t they\u2019re adults they can sort it.", "One could argue this is your karma for allowing your daughter to dictate to you whatever she wants in your house lol. NTA.", "Sorry but you've enabled your daughter. In her late twenties, your daughter shouldn't have you paying everything for her life anymore.  You need to kick them out and rent to someone who has a lease and if they don't pay will be kicked out.\n\nFirstly tell her that you can no longer handle the heat and the electric and you'll be putting them in her name and it will be up to her to pay them.  Have the bill sent to the address and she's going to have to figure it out.\n\nThen you start charging rent.  If she's not going to school and she's just playing house with a boyfriend, they can pay for it. If he balks, then he's a user.  \n\nIf they don't follow through after that now that it's october, after the holidays they are evicted and you get a tenant in there that will appreciate the property and make a little money", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThey\u02bbre in their mid-20s.

I've never tried to put a link in here, so I don't know if it worked.

The free ride is over. You needed to charge rent when bf moved in. They're adults and need to support themselves", "Yes, thank you - I definitely have to work at the cord cutting. Holly just started college a few years ago after working straight from high school for many years. I think that is why I am so surprised at both their reactions. They know just how tough it is having to pay all the bills. How is it that people end up resenting getting help - instead of wanting to pitch in? I appreciate it!", "Thank you - you're right.

I am being soft and (big sigh, here) I do know it - I just believed I'd get softness in return... Holly did work for several years, was very frugal and saved a lot of money at the time - so the thing is she does know how hard it is to earn money - and how to save it - but isn't acknowledging that. You are absolutely right with your advice - now I just need to follow it.", "Thank you! - tough love is the answer. I guess I'd just hoped they would kick in gladly instead of dragging their feet. I appreciate it!", "I appreciate your honesty - I have to say you are right. I should have done this a long time ago. I would've saved me - and them probably - lots of anguish. Thank you!", "Thank you for your reply! Yes... though first there was the cheerful asking, the firmer please, the come on clean up,,, and it just went downhill sadly", "Thank you! Yes, it is a good life lesson - for them. For me, too I suppose, though it really hurts.", "The reality is, we get the treatement we accept.\nAnd Holly has been very selfish. I don't quite understand why she wouldn't even ask you, if she can move a whole other person in without even asking you, if you paid 100% of her expenses.\n\nHas she never worked before? Does she not know what things cost? I think you could prepare a breakdown of what kind of expenses you had for her alone and possibly for the two of them, when she moved him in without asking, so that she can prepare herself what she'll have to earn.\n\nBut that's the last of help I wohld give. She obviously is old enough to study, go out, live her life and have relationships - like an adult. She should carry the responsibikity that comes with these freedoms too.", "That's the thing, Holly worked many years before she went to college. She worked retail and was made a manager in a matter of a few months. She also at the time saved a lot of money and she still is frugal. I guess that is why I am so surprised at the way things turned out. Your first sentence says it all. I needed to hear that.", "I think she might need a reality check...\n\nShe comes from a stable background, supportive family, studies, has work experience\n\nAnd now her place is a mess, she moved in a divorced bf overnight and expects handouts and complains if you can't realistically provide for both of them?\n\nI'd try to sit down (without the boyfriend), maybe prepare a list of things, what you wonder happened and how these changes came to be.\nIs she happy, living like this? And how long has she been studying, are her studies going anywhere?"]}
