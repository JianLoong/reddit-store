We have 6 kids Between the ages 7- 15. I work Monday-Friday (14 hours 3 days a week, 12 hour 2 days) my wife is a stay at home mom. Before I get the hate comments as I\u2019ve seen in the past, I am extremely grateful. My days off, I take the kids out and my wife has the day to herself or she goes out and I handle chores. I always remind my wife, and take her out on date nights a few times a month on my days off. My sister comes by and helps out some days through out the week. \n\nWe had a financial crisis earlier this year, which resulted in me having these extra hours. It\u2019s completely necessary. 4 of our kids do extra curricular, we have to pay for and other necessities. My wife has recently been asking me to cut back hours which has been causing arguments bc it\u2019s simply impossible at the moment.\n\nWe have young twins, and earlier this week they got the flu which spread all throughout our home which had the kids home from school for majority of the week. I could not call off, but it left my wife extremely stressed out. One of our children has autism, and when they are sick it is a very big crisis in the house with tantrums. I felt horribly but I couldn\u2019t call off. \n\nBasically today my wife shouted at me for over an hour for refusing to take less hours, because she is so stressed. She said I get to escape at work, and she has a household to run. I tried to explain that I\u2019d love more then anything to be home more but I couldn\u2019t, but she continued yelling saying I was the problem.

If you can\u2019t call off, you can\u2019t call off. But I question whether the extra curricular activities are important enough to be worth burning out your wife.", "NAH but if your wife is in the hospital with a breakdown, that will require you to take off work and be a financial burden as well. Something needs to give.\n\nYou may have to look at dropping the extracurricular activities you pay for and looking at free activities , going over your budget to see if there is any way for you to cut hours; otherwise maybe paying a sitter a few hours a week to give your wife a break, or a mother\u2019s helper so it\u2019s less expensive.\n\nAlso are you in the states? Have you looked in to in home therapies and respite for your autistic child through your state? \n\nINFO you mention a financial crisis then mention \u2018extracurricular activities for 4 kids and other necessities.\u2019 What was the crisis? What exactly increased in cost that you had to work these hours?", "NAH but you need to have a sit down with your wife. Your current situation seems like it's unsustainable. I know your wife doesn't want to take away your kids' extracurricular stuff but you seriously need to think about tightening the belt. Whether that means getting rid of the extracurricular stuff, cutting down on quality of life expenses or moving somewhere cheaper.\n\nIt seems like things are at their limit when everything is working out but adding additional stress like the kids being sick and your house of cards starts to fall apart. Plus there may not be any guarantee your extra hours will always be there.\n\nEdited upon recommendation.", "NAH but this situation isn\u2019t sustainable. Is it possible for her to get a part time job that literally just pays for childcare during her time working? If she considers your job to be a break, maybe a job of her own is what she needs. She\u2019d get to interact with other adults and not be on constant child duty. Taking care of kids (especially that many) means your brain can literally not shut off for one second. That\u2019s not true in most workplaces. It might be a potential solution for you. I wish you both the best\u2014this is (hopefully) the hardest things will be.", "NAH. I don't either of you is in the wrong. For you, it's impossible to take fewer hours because of your shared financial situation. You're working to provide your family with the necessities and keep a roof over your head, you can't sacrifice that. For her, she's stressed and overwhelmed from taking care of sick kids all day. It's understandable that she's worn out. But in the end, you're both working all day and need help and understanding from each other.  \nMoving forward, I think the best thing to do is to have better communication and some sort of accommodation. She needs to not yell at you because it's not all about her, you are stressed as well. For the accommodation, does your sister have more free time to help her? Do you have parents that can come over? Neighbors (that you trust) even? It seems like things won't get better unless she somehow gets more help.", "I don't know man.  66 hours a week doesn't sound like an escape to me.  That sounds like hell.\n\nOn your next day off, can you two sit down and go through your budget?  Maybe you can work less hours if sacrifices are made in other areas and you both are willing to do that.  But also going through the budget can also reinforce why you are working those additional hours and it also can help you go over everything with a fine tooth comb to be able to see do you really need HBO Max (obviously, just an example) and where else corners can be cut.\n\nNTA", "Get the snip, dude. Do not make things harder by added to your brood.", "I can\u2019t decide between NAH and E S H. Honestly it sounds like you\u2019re both living in hell. \n\nThis is one of the risks with having so many kids-one financial issue, and you\u2019re in this position. Obviously you have the kids so you can\u2019t change that now, but you both willingly had this many kids knowing that kids are expensive and get sick often. \n\nThis is just an awful situation for everyone, and unfortunately it won\u2019t last. Somethings gotta give here. Someone will blow up or perhaps worse. Something needs to change or there will be serious consequences. Have you thought about your own health OP between the work hours and emotional stress?", "Condoms?", "Extra curriculars are not necessities. \n\nA burnt out caregiver, esp to a kid with special needs, is a dangerous thing.\n\nShe is asking you for help.

Sure she\u2019s stressed but so are you.", "NTA. Neither of your positions is easy. Your work schedule is grueling no matter what the industry is. And caring for 6 kids is also an incredibly daunting job. If you need to work this to afford the lifestyle your family wants, then it is what it is. If your wife is dead set on you working less hours, sit down with her to figure out where you can scale back as a family to accommodate the reduction in hours. Once the two of you as partners figure out what adjustments can be made, then you can reduce your hours.\n\nAnd nothing for nothing, its not fair of her to say you're escaping to work. If everything you do is exactly as described, you give 120% every day of your life.", "6 kids?!?", "1) you're going to give yourself a heart attack working that schedule.\n2) NTA for trying to support you're family, but one income with 6 kids in this economy? Why, just why?", "OR solution: she gets a part time job! Kids are in school and old enough to do chores. She don't need to be in that house 24hrs a day. She wants you home more, she can go make some money herself. Autistic will qualify for services that can get him away with a coach or behavior person.", "Easiest solution is wife gets a part-time (or full) job during the day..she can \"escape to work,\" husband can reduce hours, and they both share in parental responsibilities.  Kid's activities are important.  Depending on their hobbies/sports, there may be free/cheaper clubs they can join.  All comes down to budget -  maybe reduce date nights to 1x month, etc...be creative.  You will eventually burn yourself out working 66 hours per week.  Happened to me in a previous role.  Compromise is key, but since kids are school -age and your family is hurting financially, there is no reason for your wife to stay at home.  Cleaning and cooking can be done later in the day/off days/weekends.  Good luck!", "6 kids?? Get a hobby. Jeez.", "NAH. You\u2019re both in a difficult situation. You say you cannot take less hours and your wife is at her breaking point. There needs to be a compromise here because it\u2019s too much for your wife. 6 kids is A LOT to take care of. She needs more assistance. Can you find family to help her out more often? Are there extra expenses that you can stop financing? Are there any extracurricular activities that your kids are less enthusiastic about than others? Consider cutting those off. Give her the option of your kids doing less extracurricular activities or nothing changes if that is the only option you guys have.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Have your wife calculate what expense can be cut so that you may cut your hours.", "I'm exhausted just imagining your lives. As others have said, this is unsustainable. Do you have an end date in sight for these extra hours? \n\nIt's obvious you want to give your kids every possible opportunity. They need their mom and dad to be healthy and present. Are these extracurriculars really so important that you need to work 12 to 14 hours a day while your wife struggles to hold everything together? \n\nNo judgement intended, only compassion. If there's an end in sight, then I wish you strength. If not, perhaps it's time to reconsider a few things", "NTA.  All of your children are school age, so your wife can get a PT job if she wants you to work fewer hours.", "NAH but maybe it's worth examining alternative solutions. Maybe you take a look at your budget together and see if there are things you can cut back on or maybe she would like to get a job and you could cut back your hours.\n\nI have 4 kids and we all just went through a bought of illness and I know I get extremely tired and stressed out as well as a SAHM. And my husband works mostly from home and only 40 hours a week. \n\nI can't imagine the added stress of 66 hour work weeks or being alone with the kids for all those hours especially while they are sick and grouchy. \n\nIt sounds like you are both headed for burn out or maybe she's already there.", "NAH\n\nDo you ever sleep? This whole situation sounds so stressful for both of you.\n\nYou both seem like you're at your wits end dealing with everything.\n\nDo you have relatives who could take the pressure off?\n\nI feel like it's important to talk to each other about what you're going through. As long as it's not approached as a fight. Just a conversation where you appreciate each other's difficulties and work forward together as a team.\n\nI can't even imagine handling 6 kids! Best wishes", "ESH sounds to me like your wife could work (perhaps she could find some work from home, or one day on the weekend).

(You are both being slight assholes but the circumstances warrant some grace).\n\nThe key is to approach this as a team. If you can\u2019t cut back your hours, find some other ways to get her help. Set up carpools and/or after school events for the older kids that you can do pickup for, maybe set up 3 hours of babysitting for the youngest one afternoon per week.

She's overwhelmed with the amount of work needed to do at home. You're working hard to keep food on the table and keep a roof over everyone's heads. She needs the help, but you need the hours. It's going to be hard for a while, unless she decides to get a job too. \n\nHere's what I suggest (Speaking from experience): \n\n* For food, unless absolutely needed for certain things, go for store brand on everything. You'll be saving at least a good $50 each grocery run. You can also reach out to food banks and other community services. These services are there for use. Don't be afraid to use them if you're starting to struggle for money. \n* See if your sister or any other nearby family or friends who don't work during the day would be willing to lend an extra hand on things for a while, if they have the time. I know you said your sister already comes by and helps out, but see if anyone else would be available. Many hands make light work. \n* See if you can arrange carpool for the kids to get to and from their extracurriculars if possible (If they haven't already). That will give your wife and you more time to focus on other things without worrying about transportation. \n* Rework the budget. If things are that tight, look over where all the money goes and see where you can cut back or where you need to adjust. Doing that will allow you and your wife to really sit down and see how important it is you work these hours if everything is to continue. \n* Have your wife pick up part time work if possible. There's certain jobs she can do while at home in between housework (like transcribing subtitles or similar work). Light duty things that she can complete swiftly and gain a little extra cash. There's also survey aps that pay you money to complete surveys she can look into. \n\nI know it's not much, and you're probably doing a lot of this already, but sometimes going back and looking over all of it again can show you where things are falling through and where you can fix it. \n\nI wish you all the best of luck OP. I hope everyone feels better soon.", "NTA but something has to give.  Theoretically your wife has at a minimum 6hrs every day to herself while all 6 kids are in school.

Maybe consider only the oldest teens get to continue in extra curricular activities.  Keep activities that are school based if it\u2019s not too much of a burden.  \nLook into carpooling to activities with other parents on the same team.  One parent takes, the other picks up.  That sort of thing.  Cut extracurriculars that cost money!  Look into rec sports and other options.

We have 6 kids Between the ages 7- 15. I work Monday-Friday (14 hours 3 days a week, 12 hour 2 days) my wife is a stay at home mom. Before I get the hate comments as I\u2019ve seen in the past, I am extremely grateful. My days off, I take the kids out and my wife has the day to herself or she goes out and I handle chores. I always remind my wife, and take her out on date nights a few times a month on my days off. My sister comes by and helps out some days through out the week. \n\nWe had a financial crisis earlier this year, which resulted in me having these extra hours. It\u2019s completely necessary. 4 of our kids do extra curricular, we have to pay for and other necessities. My wife has recently been asking me to cut back hours which has been causing arguments bc it\u2019s simply impossible at the moment.\n\nWe have young twins, and earlier this week they got the flu which spread all throughout our home which had the kids home from school for majority of the week. I could not call off, but it left my wife extremely stressed out. One of our children has autism, and when they are sick it is a very big crisis in the house with tantrums. I felt horribly but I couldn\u2019t call off. \n\nBasically today my wife shouted at me for over an hour for refusing to take less hours, because she is so stressed. She said I get to escape at work, and she has a household to run. I tried to explain that I\u2019d love more then anything to be home more but I couldn\u2019t, but she continued yelling saying I was the problem. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She obviously does not feel the the hours are necessary - which indicates that youre not on the same level when it comes to your family finances.\n\nIt comes of as an outright refusal to do what she says, rather than seeking a compromise based on what is actually needed. And if the hours are absolutely, black on white, necessary for the children to remain in their chosen extra curriculars, then she needs to understand. But that is still not a no, its a compromise and you need her to understand that. \n\nIt might be semantics, but saying \"I have to do X, so that our children can do Y and we still have Z Would you prefer that our children go without Y, or we reduce Z, in order to avoid X? \" is very different to \"I cant/wont reduce X\"", "Tell ur wife she can get a job and u can put ur young kids into daycare with her income since she thinks u going to work is a vacation away from the children it sounds like she's burnt out and tired of the same ol routine but it also sounds like u need to work those hours to make ends meet geez ur in a tough situation here but honestly NTA and ur wife NTA but she shouldn't be yelling at u for an hour with all them kids around or acting like u working is a day on the beach", "Folks.

Further, after reductions of your medical costs, the state may have a fund or a source of grants (churches also have these) to offset your medical expenses/losses.
