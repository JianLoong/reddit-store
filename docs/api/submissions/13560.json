{"id": 13560, "submission_id": "126os4x", "title": "AITA for not wanting to go to the gym with my wife anymore?", "selftext": "I(29M) have been working out religiously for about a year now. It has done wonders for my mental health as well as my physical experience. My wife(28F) noticed my gains as well as how I seemed much happier and she told me that she wanted to go to the gym as well. I said that's wonderful.\n\nSo I prepared my wife a basic lifting routine, based on her weight and age, and we set off. Before working out, I told my wife about the importance of warming up and doing dynamic stretches before lifting, and we then started. The problem was that she didn't really want to push herself. I knew she could hit 8-12 reps of the weight I had chosen for her, but she stopped at 6 and complained that it hurt. The thing is it's supposed to hurt, and by hurt, she meant that she felt sore, not that she was injured. \n\nThis pattern of behavior continued for the next couple of weeks, she would always intentionally set low weight, or try and skip an exercise at the end of the session, like if it was leg day, she would gimp out on calf raises for example. It was just very intolerable, and she no longer used to smile or talk to me while going to the gym, it was almost like she shut down. I was beginning to think that she is blaming me, so I asked her if she's mad at me. Almost like a floodgate opening she blew up on me. At this point I became pissed because I'm doing a favor and I told her \"well I'm not going to take you if you continue to goof off, real change takes work and the gym is supposed to be hard, if it's easy you're not doing it right\". I feel like that may have been a bit tactless, and a couple of hours later she's still giving me the cold shoulder.", "created_utc": 1680186574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126os4x/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_the_gym_with_my/", "score": 744, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've shown her that your advice isn't worth listening to at all.", "Just because she's going to the gym with you doesn't necessarily mean she wants to lift weights like you do. Some women enjoy more cardio type of exercises. She could've been happier on an elliptical, bike or treadmill instead of ending up as your lift partner.

You've sucked all of the enjoyment out of this for her.", "As a Personal Trainer ,YTA big time, and i will show you where you are wrong!\n\nEverybody is different, and they experience muscle failure and pain at their own rate, \nYou want to ease a new person into working out,\nStart small and build from there,no pain, no gain is such a stupid thing to rely on because our mind,body has evolved to run away from pain and discomfort,\nYou lucky she didn't quit after 1 workout,and foremost provably, you ruined her view on working out as punishment,pain thing.\n\nStart small,encourage, and support positively.\nRome wasn't built in 1 day!", "YTA a million times over. You're bullying your wife for knowing her physical limits and not adhering to the plan you, who's not a professional trainer made her. Let her go at her own pace and leave her the damn alone. Way to spoil the gym experience for her.", "YTA. At every possible juncture.\n\nShe told you it hurt and you refused to listen to her. Clearly you were too aggressive with your suggestions for her, but decided instead of adapting your plan to call her lazy.\n\nShe would skip one single exercise and you would find that \"intolerable\"? Do you have exercise OCD or something? That's the only reason I can think of that someone would lose their shit over somebody skipping a single exercise.\n\nOf course your wife shut down. You're treating her like garbage, not listening to her feedback on her pain levels, and telling her that she's lazy.\n\nWay to make the gym the least fun experience that it could possibly be.

It was nice for you to come up with a routine for your wife but she's not obligated to follow it at all let alone religiously. Instead of encouraging her to find her own mold you've tried to control how she uses her time at the gym and getting annoyed when she doesn't live up to what you expect. If her goal was to feel better about herself and get a bit healthier that doesn mean she needs a strict routine from you. The fact that she's trying to Make a habit of going is a huge milestone for many people to accomplish.", "Be honest. Did you **honestly** think you would be considered anything but an asshole here?", "YTA. Your attitude is why people DON'T go to the gym! You think YOU have all the answers, and YOU know people better than they know themselves.\n\nIf *you* want to be a masochist and push yourself to misery at the gym, that's *your* business. But leave your wife out of it. Quit turning your masochism into sadism. If she wants a lighter workout, she can have a lighter workout. It's her body and she can do whatever wants with it. You don't own her.", "INFO: Did you sit down with her and listen to what her goals were? And were you upfront that reaching them wasn't going to be easy?", "YTA.

Except now she hates it because you sucked all the fun out of it.", "YTA - You aren\u2019t a personal trainer, I see no information about working out her limits with her prior to arbitrarily assigning her limits, I see no mention of her hormone cycle which affects women and their ability to work out.

The only thing the gym is \u201csupposed to be\u201d is enjoyable for the person going. There is nothing wrong with going to the gym and slowly walking on the treadmill the whole time listening to an audio book. There is nothing wrong with doing fewer reps than is physically possible. \n\nNone of what you said limits your ability to work out the way you want to. You just want to force your wife to do things she doesn\u2019t want to do.", "YTA  \nmy Ex did just the same bullshit. \"Knew\" my limits better than me, knew I had to do more cardio because that's women are supposed to do. Sports/Gym/etc need to be fun or someone won't stick to it. I HATED going to the gym at some point because my Ex was incapabale of doing anything else but the gym. Food needed to match his weekly changing diets, knew forms of exercise blablablabla. I hated it and since Ex is now Ex, I'm taking a break from the gym because I can't get ride of the hate I'm still feeling for it.", "YTA - sounds like she wanted to go with you to work out & you decided to control her workout and be her coach. Not the same thing.", "I find it not only interesting but also extremely telling that you do not elaborate on what was said when the \u201cfloodgate\u201d opened or what \u201cshe blew up on me\u201d was about. \n\nYTA", "YTA. your way of working out and your attitude towards the gym are not the only ones out there.\n\nthe best exercise is the one that you do consistently because you enjoy it. she doesn't like the routine you created, and there's nothing wrong with that. \n\nlet her do what she wants to do in the gym. she's not your child. she's not your client. she's your wife.", "YTA why does she have to do you program? Why can\u2019t she do what she wants? You made her hate going to the gym when she used to enjoy going with you. Instead of lecturing her let her be to do what she wants.", "YTA. Getting into the gym and starting is the hardest part. Why not ease her into it and let her figure out what she enjoys? You even said it takes time and dedication. So what if she misses a month of calf raises in the beginning or stays lifting at the same weight for 3 months? She would still be showing up and hopefully enjoying herself.", "So about 2 years ago I joined a gym and the \"trainer\" thought he knew my limits better than me. I pushed myself because he said I could take it and I'm a people pleaser (it annoys me too). I was sore all the time but I just kept pushing. After 2 months of this I start getting excruciating pains in my chest one night. I thought I was dying. Go to the ER and find out I have costochondritus due to muscle trauma and strain. The next two weeks of my life I spent at home in constant pain barely able to breathe. Anytime I took a deep breath it felt like someone was stabbing me. I had to stay hooked up to a tens unit just to be able to function. There are very real consequences for pushing yourself too far. Women and men are not the same. We can't physically do what men can. Stop treating her like the problem. YTA", "YTA \u201cthis pattern of behavior\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s not a child or a client or someone who needs to beneed spoken about in such a condescending way. She\u2019s your partner. Just because she has goals and goes to the gym does not mean it\u2019s ok for you to talk to her like you are her trainer or keeper. She\u2019s your wife. Positive reinforcement. She\u2019s also biologically different. So for whatever reason she isn\u2019t able to keep up to your standards, perhaps ask urself why have high standards for her and consider that us women have standards for ourselves that are pretty high as it is and the consistent reminder and controlling Is not warranted. My ex did this all the time until we broke up and it took him 3 years where he went wrong", "YTA and your behavior is controlling and abusive.

Who are you to decide when her body is done or not? Why can't someone ENJOY going to the gym?

It's cool that you have a mindset of pushing yourself, your wife clearly wants to be a little less extreme about it.  People can go to the gym for different reasons, with different expectations.  I go to use weight machines and do some cardio, I may not make gains but I don't care, I'm still getting exercise in.  Maybe that's all your wife wants, or maybe she just wants to share in something that's obviously important to you without you acting like a drill instructor and making her miserable the entire session.  Exercise is good and healthy, and you are driving your wife away from it by acting like any effort she puts in is not enough.  Some exercise is better than none.", "YTA.

You have no idea what she\u2019s feeling. You are deciding for her how she feels and what she needs with no regard for what she wants or how she feels", "YTA. I could squat almost 150% my body weight as a woman when I went regularly, but after taking a couple years off I lost all my muscles and strength and started from zero.

And that\u2019s ok, because in the beginning it\u2019s all about movement, form, finding what works for you, and getting comfortable with your muscles again. If something hurts, I stop and lower the weight. If I\u2019m too sore, I stay home and rest. The gym is enjoyable because we push ourselves, not because our bf is next to us telling us how lazy we are and how we\u2019re doing it wrong. If you have 0 enjoyment, you won\u2019t stick with it. \n\nPlus what is this \u201cchange\u201d you want her to realize? Even if she does \u201cgoof around\u201d the gym, I\u2019d welcome it because it\u2019s better than not going at all and being inactive at home.", "YTA, pretty big one too, by the sounds of it \nI was leaning towards no asshole here because it seemed at first like you were genuinely trying to help her and get her to know the difference between paying and soreness. However, after reading a number of your responses, yeah, YTA.", "YTA. Are you always this controlling and patronising? She\u2019s an adult who can make her own decisions, not a child who needs to be punished for not doing her homework. Working out should be enjoyable, and if it\u2019s not, she\u2019s less likely to make it part of her routine. But you don\u2019t seem to give a rats ass about her feelings. In fact, it seems like you\u2019re just relishing the idea of lording over her and acting like some pseudo authority figure on a power trip. Do you feel inadequate in other areas of your life like your job, so now you have to bully your wife to feel like an important big man? Gross. Get professional help. You are not doing her a favour by making her miserable and putting strain on your relationship.", "YTA and a major one at that. She did not ask you to train her, she did not tell you her goals for working out, all she did was say that she wants to join you because you seem happier. She just wanted to spend some extra time with you and casually work out to feel good. Instead, you created a whole set for her, which you didn't say that she even asked for, and admitted that you made it for her to feel sore. You didn't ask if she wanted that, if she even wanted that kind of progress. \n\n\nAnd newsflash bud, you can get progress from not causing physical pain and soreness. Repetitive movements at lower weights is actually way healthier for your body than pushing yourself until you hurt.\n\n\nAnyway, your awful training aside, she didn't ask for it. She clearly just wanted a casual session and to feel good about getting out, moving around, and spending quality time with you. And you ruined it.

YTA.", "YTA - the cool thing about the gym is that it's for all levels of fitness.\n\nNo one is going to do anything they don't find enjoyable. \n\nYou need a reality check.

Who is to say that a fit 29M gym regular's routine should be anywhere near what a 28F gym novice's should be?\n\nYou are an awful trainer. You aren't a very good boyfriend.

Maybe that wouldn't be a bad thing?", "YTA \u2014 you got your wife in the gym door and exercising with you. Instead of being pumped (pun intended) that she was there and sharing this experience with you, you developed a negative attitude because she was not working out in the way you deemed appropriate. The moment she didn\u2019t seem to be keeping pace with your plan you should have either adjusted your plan, your expectations, or both.  Different people want different things in the gym. For instance, I just got back to working out after a baby and I\u2019m looking to have fun and burn some calories and guess what that is \u201creal change\u201d to me. It sounds like your wife is more causal with her fitness goals and that\u2019s OK, that doesn\u2019t make it less worthy. Fitness is not all or nothing, it\u2019s like brushing your teeth: you wouldn\u2019t stop just because you missed a day or did a shitty job brushing on Tuesday.

It has done wonders for my mental health as well as my physical experience. My wife(28F) noticed my gains as well as how I seemed much happier and she told me that she wanted to go to the gym as well. I said that's wonderful.\n\nSo I prepared my wife a basic lifting routine, based on her weight and age, and we set off. Before working out, I told my wife about the importance of warming up and doing dynamic stretches before lifting, and we then started. The problem was that she didn't really want to push herself. I knew she could hit 8-12 reps of the weight I had chosen for her, but she stopped at 6 and complained that it hurt. The thing is it's supposed to hurt, and by hurt, she meant that she felt sore, not that she was injured. \n\nThis pattern of behavior continued for the next couple of weeks, she would always intentionally set low weight, or try and skip an exercise at the end of the session, like if it was leg day, she would gimp out on calf raises for example. It was just very intolerable, and she no longer used to smile or talk to me while going to the gym, it was almost like she shut down. I was beginning to think that she is blaming me, so I asked her if she's mad at me. Almost like a floodgate opening she blew up on me. At this point I became pissed because I'm doing a favor and I told her \"well I'm not going to take you if you continue to goof off, real change takes work and the gym is supposed to be hard, if it's easy you're not doing it right\". I feel like that may have been a bit tactless, and a couple of hours later she's still giving me the cold shoulder.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Pain is a warning injury could occur. \n\nYTA in more ways than one.", "YTA. You may have started going to the gym first, but that doesn\u2019t mean that your wife has to do it your way if she wants to start exercising too. \n\nShe asked you to help her get started with a \u201cregular routine,\u201d and you helped to create one for her, which was helpful to give her a starting point to work from. \n\nWhat\u2019s not okay is that, when she adjusted the routine to fit her current abilities and priorities, you took that personally - as if she was somehow obligated to adhere to the general, height-and-weight-based workout regimen you created for her. Just because she doesn\u2019t want to \u201cgym\u201d as hard as you doesn\u2019t make her lazy, dude.\n\nI\u2019ll share a personal anecdote because it\u2019s relevant. My partner and I have been together for 8 years, and he\u2019s been working out since before we met. He\u2019s extremely fit, and looks *very* good. He\u2019s achieved/maintained that by working out and average of 5-6 days/week, for 1.5 - 2 hours a day. It\u2019s something he greatly values, and I\u2019ve always respected that.\n\nI, on the other hand, was active out of obligation growing up, (always had to have a physical activity,) but I really hated physical exercise.\n\nOnce I hit college, I stopped exercising pretty much altogether, but I also met my partner. He always encouraged me to go to the gym with him, but given my aversion to physical discomfort and the fact that I didn\u2019t gain any weight, I didn\u2019t have any incentive to start exercising again. \n\nI ended up doing yoga/Pilates on and off for several years, but I never really stuck with it. I told myself I\u2019d start taking my health/exercising more seriously when I hit 25. Halfway through 25, I remembered my \u201cpromise\u201d to myself, and I started doing Pilates regularly again for a few months; however, for the first time, I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the results I was getting, and I wanted more; so I started looking into cardio/HIIT training workouts I could do at home. \n\nI\u2019ll spare you the details, but I have been doing cardio and weight training 4-5 days/week for a little over a year now. It took me a long time to \u201cget comfortable with being uncomfortable,\u201d and, more importantly, what pushed me to do that was *me*. My partner had been trying for nearly 7 years (respectfully,) to get me to go to the gym/exercise regularly, but ultimately, it had to come from me, and be what *I* wanted to do in order for it to stick. \n\nI\u2019ll also add that he was (and is) delighted that I\u2019m exercising regularly, as his main concern had always been my long-term health, as well as wanting to have some physical activities we do together, (hiking, camping, biking, etc.) which I\u2019d always been reluctant to agree to, out of the fear that our very different fitness levels would lead to him being disappointed/bored, or me being unable to finish the activity/unable to move for days afterwards.\n\nMy point here is, you can\u2019t force your wife to work out the way you want her to, or think is best for her. She needs to do what she does because it aligns with her personal physical/health goals; and if she stays at the same level, that\u2019s great - any exercise, especially regularly, is *always* better than none at all. And if she does decide to push herself more, it has to be because it\u2019s what she wants to do. I\u2019ve personally found that both being dissatisfied *and* excited by the results of my exercising are equally motivating factors that have pushed me to challenge myself.

The great thing about my gym is every trainer will tell you if you need to, modify the workout to fit your body. Especially at the beginning I had to do half the recommended reps with like a 7.5 lb dumbbell because I wasn\u2019t strong enough to do more than that with out hurting myself or having terrible form.

She kinda did want him as an unofficial trainer. She notices positive changes in spouse's life and wants those changes for herself. She then asks OP if she can go to the gym with him. If I were OP, I would assume that would also mean 'I want you to help me reach my fitness goals', otherwise why would she ask to go with him and want to have the same positive life changes he's been having. So I'd probably be setting similar standards for her too because he is right about the \"gotta work hard to get hard\" concept. If she truly wanted to see changes, she was gonna have to push herself and not just show up.\n\nAt the same time though, OP definitely went too far. She seemed like she wanted some help at the most and mostly just wanted to give it a shot to see if it was something she was up to doing. He decided to take full creative and leadership control over her and didn't really give her any breathing room. To a gym newb, all the workout routines and expectations set for her right out the gate probably overwhelmed her and probably came off condescending since OP is her spouse, not her official physical trainer. Everybody knows that's the biggest mistake a newb can make since the beginning of a daily workout lifestyle is all about accomplishing mental gains first! If you overwhelm yourself in the beginning you'll lose confidence and give up. OP should have known better. I kinda feel like he wanted this to happen. Like he didn't want a workout partner to begin with but instead of just saying that to her, he made the experience shit for her so she wouldn't wanna do it with him anymore.\n\nFor many years I would compare myself to these online influencers and see how fit they were and Id just feel bad about myself. I'd use that self pity to motivate me to go to the gym, but obviously I wouldn't see or feel results right away. And because Id go long periods of time without exercise, Id feel week af and be struggling with minimal stuff. It always felt like a humiliating experience. So naturally, Id get really discouraged and quit. \n\nIt wasn't until just about a few months ago that I made a big perspective change which led me to have the best overall experience with my workout journy so far. I realized that if I was gonna reach my goals, I was gonna have to accept the fact that I can't just make a 'get rich quick' workout plan, but needed to accept that this was gonna be my lifestyle from this point forward. I'd have to be disciplined everyday and go consistantly and it'd be a long time before I saw or felt results and that it was okay. I realized I needed to conquer some mental blocks and demons FIRST! I needed to learn how to be comfortable at the gym, not worry about what people thought of me and most importantly I needed it become a habit. So initially I just focused on that, making it a habit. So for the first month Id mostly just hop on the treadmill and run, maybe do some situps afterwards but that was pretty much it. It was all about building consistancy in the beginning. And then slowly as I was building confidence and a daily routine, I started increasing the amount of exercise; reps, weight and adding new machines, etc. I've now been going pretty consistantly for about 5 months and I'm really proud of myself. I still haven't noticed significant physical changes but I have noticed a lot of mental changes! Which imo is more important. And I'm sure after about a full year, I'll see some physical improvement! I've taught myself that it's okay to not see results right away and to trust the process! Patience is key!", "Re #2: I've been going to a workout class and the lady teaching it asked me how I felt during an exercise.
