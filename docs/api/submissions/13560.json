{"id": 13560, "submission_id": "126os4x", "title": "AITA for not wanting to go to the gym with my wife anymore?", "selftext": "I(29M) have been working out religiously for about a year now. It has done wonders for my mental health as well as my physical experience. My wife(28F) noticed my gains as well as how I seemed much happier and she told me that she wanted to go to the gym as well. I said that's wonderful.\n\nSo I prepared my wife a basic lifting routine, based on her weight and age, and we set off. Before working out, I told my wife about the importance of warming up and doing dynamic stretches before lifting, and we then started. The problem was that she didn't really want to push herself. I knew she could hit 8-12 reps of the weight I had chosen for her, but she stopped at 6 and complained that it hurt. The thing is it's supposed to hurt, and by hurt, she meant that she felt sore, not that she was injured. \n\nThis pattern of behavior continued for the next couple of weeks, she would always intentionally set low weight, or try and skip an exercise at the end of the session, like if it was leg day, she would gimp out on calf raises for example. It was just very intolerable, and she no longer used to smile or talk to me while going to the gym, it was almost like she shut down. I was beginning to think that she is blaming me, so I asked her if she's mad at me. Almost like a floodgate opening she blew up on me. At this point I became pissed because I'm doing a favor and I told her \"well I'm not going to take you if you continue to goof off, real change takes work and the gym is supposed to be hard, if it's easy you're not doing it right\". I feel like that may have been a bit tactless, and a couple of hours later she's still giving me the cold shoulder.", "created_utc": 1680186574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126os4x/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_the_gym_with_my/", "score": 3567, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've shown her that your advice isn't worth listening to at all.", "Just because she's going to the gym with you doesn't necessarily mean she wants to lift weights like you do.

Clearly you were too aggressive with your suggestions for her, but decided instead of adapting your plan to call her lazy.\n\nShe would skip one single exercise and you would find that \"intolerable\"? Do you have exercise OCD or something? That's the only reason I can think of that someone would lose their shit over somebody skipping a single exercise.\n\nOf course your wife shut down. You're treating her like garbage, not listening to her feedback on her pain levels, and telling her that she's lazy.\n\nWay to make the gym the least fun experience that it could possibly be.

It was nice for you to come up with a routine for your wife but she's not obligated to follow it at all let alone religiously. Instead of encouraging her to find her own mold you've tried to control how she uses her time at the gym and getting annoyed when she doesn't live up to what you expect. If her goal was to feel better about herself and get a bit healthier that doesn mean she needs a strict routine from you. The fact that she's trying to Make a habit of going is a huge milestone for many people to accomplish.", "Be honest. Did you **honestly** think you would be considered anything but an asshole here?", "YTA. Your attitude is why people DON'T go to the gym! You think YOU have all the answers, and YOU know people better than they know themselves.\n\nIf *you* want to be a masochist and push yourself to misery at the gym, that's *your* business.

The only thing the gym is \u201csupposed to be\u201d is enjoyable for the person going.

Sports/Gym/etc need to be fun or someone won't stick to it. I HATED going to the gym at some point because my Ex was incapabale of doing anything else but the gym. Food needed to match his weekly changing diets, knew forms of exercise blablablabla. I hated it and since Ex is now Ex, I'm taking a break from the gym because I can't get ride of the hate I'm still feeling for it.", "YTA - sounds like she wanted to go with you to work out & you decided to control her workout and be her coach.

Why can\u2019t she do what she wants? You made her hate going to the gym when she used to enjoy going with you. Instead of lecturing her let her be to do what she wants.", "YTA. Getting into the gym and starting is the hardest part. Why not ease her into it and let her figure out what she enjoys? You even said it takes time and dedication. So what if she misses a month of calf raises in the beginning or stays lifting at the same weight for 3 months? She would still be showing up and hopefully enjoying herself.", "So about 2 years ago I joined a gym and the \"trainer\" thought he knew my limits better than me. I pushed myself because he said I could take it and I'm a people pleaser (it annoys me too). I was sore all the time but I just kept pushing. After 2 months of this I start getting excruciating pains in my chest one night. I thought I was dying. Go to the ER and find out I have costochondritus due to muscle trauma and strain. The next two weeks of my life I spent at home in constant pain barely able to breathe. Anytime I took a deep breath it felt like someone was stabbing me. I had to stay hooked up to a tens unit just to be able to function. There are very real consequences for pushing yourself too far. Women and men are not the same. We can't physically do what men can. Stop treating her like the problem. YTA", "YTA \u201cthis pattern of behavior\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s not a child or a client or someone who needs to beneed spoken about in such a condescending way. She\u2019s your partner. Just because she has goals and goes to the gym does not mean it\u2019s ok for you to talk to her like you are her trainer or keeper. She\u2019s your wife. Positive reinforcement. She\u2019s also biologically different. So for whatever reason she isn\u2019t able to keep up to your standards, perhaps ask urself why have high standards for her and consider that us women have standards for ourselves that are pretty high as it is and the consistent reminder and controlling Is not warranted. My ex did this all the time until we broke up and it took him 3 years where he went wrong", "YTA and your behavior is controlling and abusive.

It's cool that you have a mindset of pushing yourself, your wife clearly wants to be a little less extreme about it.  People can go to the gym for different reasons, with different expectations.  I go to use weight machines and do some cardio, I may not make gains but I don't care, I'm still getting exercise in.  Maybe that's all your wife wants, or maybe she just wants to share in something that's obviously important to you without you acting like a drill instructor and making her miserable the entire session.

If something hurts, I stop and lower the weight. If I\u2019m too sore, I stay home and rest. The gym is enjoyable because we push ourselves, not because our bf is next to us telling us how lazy we are and how we\u2019re doing it wrong.

However, after reading a number of your responses, yeah, YTA.", "YTA. Are you always this controlling and patronising? She\u2019s an adult who can make her own decisions, not a child who needs to be punished for not doing her homework. Working out should be enjoyable, and if it\u2019s not, she\u2019s less likely to make it part of her routine. But you don\u2019t seem to give a rats ass about her feelings. In fact, it seems like you\u2019re just relishing the idea of lording over her and acting like some pseudo authority figure on a power trip. Do you feel inadequate in other areas of your life like your job, so now you have to bully your wife to feel like an important big man? Gross. Get professional help. You are not doing her a favour by making her miserable and putting strain on your relationship.", "YTA and a major one at that. She did not ask you to train her, she did not tell you her goals for working out, all she did was say that she wants to join you because you seem happier. She just wanted to spend some extra time with you and casually work out to feel good. Instead, you created a whole set for her, which you didn't say that she even asked for, and admitted that you made it for her to feel sore. You didn't ask if she wanted that, if she even wanted that kind of progress. \n\n\nAnd newsflash bud, you can get progress from not causing physical pain and soreness. Repetitive movements at lower weights is actually way healthier for your body than pushing yourself until you hurt.\n\n\nAnyway, your awful training aside, she didn't ask for it. She clearly just wanted a casual session and to feel good about getting out, moving around, and spending quality time with you. And you ruined it.

Maybe that wouldn't be a bad thing?", "YTA \u2014 you got your wife in the gym door and exercising with you. Instead of being pumped (pun intended) that she was there and sharing this experience with you, you developed a negative attitude because she was not working out in the way you deemed appropriate. The moment she didn\u2019t seem to be keeping pace with your plan you should have either adjusted your plan, your expectations, or both.  Different people want different things in the gym. For instance, I just got back to working out after a baby and I\u2019m looking to have fun and burn some calories and guess what that is \u201creal change\u201d to me. It sounds like your wife is more causal with her fitness goals and that\u2019s OK, that doesn\u2019t make it less worthy. Fitness is not all or nothing, it\u2019s like brushing your teeth: you wouldn\u2019t stop just because you missed a day or did a shitty job brushing on Tuesday.

It has done wonders for my mental health as well as my physical experience. My wife(28F) noticed my gains as well as how I seemed much happier and she told me that she wanted to go to the gym as well. I said that's wonderful.\n\nSo I prepared my wife a basic lifting routine, based on her weight and age, and we set off. Before working out, I told my wife about the importance of warming up and doing dynamic stretches before lifting, and we then started. The problem was that she didn't really want to push herself. I knew she could hit 8-12 reps of the weight I had chosen for her, but she stopped at 6 and complained that it hurt. The thing is it's supposed to hurt, and by hurt, she meant that she felt sore, not that she was injured. \n\nThis pattern of behavior continued for the next couple of weeks, she would always intentionally set low weight, or try and skip an exercise at the end of the session, like if it was leg day, she would gimp out on calf raises for example. It was just very intolerable, and she no longer used to smile or talk to me while going to the gym, it was almost like she shut down. I was beginning to think that she is blaming me, so I asked her if she's mad at me. Almost like a floodgate opening she blew up on me. At this point I became pissed because I'm doing a favor and I told her \"well I'm not going to take you if you continue to goof off, real change takes work and the gym is supposed to be hard, if it's easy you're not doing it right\". I feel like that may have been a bit tactless, and a couple of hours later she's still giving me the cold shoulder.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You may have started going to the gym first, but that doesn\u2019t mean that your wife has to do it your way if she wants to start exercising too. \n\nShe asked you to help her get started with a \u201cregular routine,\u201d and you helped to create one for her, which was helpful to give her a starting point to work from. \n\nWhat\u2019s not okay is that, when she adjusted the routine to fit her current abilities and priorities, you took that personally - as if she was somehow obligated to adhere to the general, height-and-weight-based workout regimen you created for her. Just because she doesn\u2019t want to \u201cgym\u201d as hard as you doesn\u2019t make her lazy, dude.\n\nI\u2019ll share a personal anecdote because it\u2019s relevant. My partner and I have been together for 8 years, and he\u2019s been working out since before we met. He\u2019s extremely fit, and looks *very* good. He\u2019s achieved/maintained that by working out and average of 5-6 days/week, for 1.5 - 2 hours a day. It\u2019s something he greatly values, and I\u2019ve always respected that.\n\nI, on the other hand, was active out of obligation growing up, (always had to have a physical activity,) but I really hated physical exercise.\n\nOnce I hit college, I stopped exercising pretty much altogether, but I also met my partner. He always encouraged me to go to the gym with him, but given my aversion to physical discomfort and the fact that I didn\u2019t gain any weight, I didn\u2019t have any incentive to start exercising again. \n\nI ended up doing yoga/Pilates on and off for several years, but I never really stuck with it. I told myself I\u2019d start taking my health/exercising more seriously when I hit 25. Halfway through 25, I remembered my \u201cpromise\u201d to myself, and I started doing Pilates regularly again for a few months; however, for the first time, I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the results I was getting, and I wanted more; so I started looking into cardio/HIIT training workouts I could do at home. \n\nI\u2019ll spare you the details, but I have been doing cardio and weight training 4-5 days/week for a little over a year now. It took me a long time to \u201cget comfortable with being uncomfortable,\u201d and, more importantly, what pushed me to do that was *me*. My partner had been trying for nearly 7 years (respectfully,) to get me to go to the gym/exercise regularly, but ultimately, it had to come from me, and be what *I* wanted to do in order for it to stick. \n\nI\u2019ll also add that he was (and is) delighted that I\u2019m exercising regularly, as his main concern had always been my long-term health, as well as wanting to have some physical activities we do together, (hiking, camping, biking, etc.) which I\u2019d always been reluctant to agree to, out of the fear that our very different fitness levels would lead to him being disappointed/bored, or me being unable to finish the activity/unable to move for days afterwards.\n\nMy point here is, you can\u2019t force your wife to work out the way you want her to, or think is best for her. She needs to do what she does because it aligns with her personal physical/health goals; and if she stays at the same level, that\u2019s great - any exercise, especially regularly, is *always* better than none at all. And if she does decide to push herself more, it has to be because it\u2019s what she wants to do. I\u2019ve personally found that both being dissatisfied *and* excited by the results of my exercising are equally motivating factors that have pushed me to challenge myself.

The great thing about my gym is every trainer will tell you if you need to, modify the workout to fit your body. Especially at the beginning I had to do half the recommended reps with like a 7.5 lb dumbbell because I wasn\u2019t strong enough to do more than that with out hurting myself or having terrible form.

She kinda did want him as an unofficial trainer. She notices positive changes in spouse's life and wants those changes for herself. She then asks OP if she can go to the gym with him. If I were OP, I would assume that would also mean 'I want you to help me reach my fitness goals', otherwise why would she ask to go with him and want to have the same positive life changes he's been having. So I'd probably be setting similar standards for her too because he is right about the \"gotta work hard to get hard\" concept. If she truly wanted to see changes, she was gonna have to push herself and not just show up.\n\nAt the same time though, OP definitely went too far. She seemed like she wanted some help at the most and mostly just wanted to give it a shot to see if it was something she was up to doing. He decided to take full creative and leadership control over her and didn't really give her any breathing room. To a gym newb, all the workout routines and expectations set for her right out the gate probably overwhelmed her and probably came off condescending since OP is her spouse, not her official physical trainer. Everybody knows that's the biggest mistake a newb can make since the beginning of a daily workout lifestyle is all about accomplishing mental gains first! If you overwhelm yourself in the beginning you'll lose confidence and give up. OP should have known better. I kinda feel like he wanted this to happen. Like he didn't want a workout partner to begin with but instead of just saying that to her, he made the experience shit for her so she wouldn't wanna do it with him anymore.\n\nFor many years I would compare myself to these online influencers and see how fit they were and Id just feel bad about myself. I'd use that self pity to motivate me to go to the gym, but obviously I wouldn't see or feel results right away. And because Id go long periods of time without exercise, Id feel week af and be struggling with minimal stuff. It always felt like a humiliating experience. So naturally, Id get really discouraged and quit. \n\nIt wasn't until just about a few months ago that I made a big perspective change which led me to have the best overall experience with my workout journy so far. I realized that if I was gonna reach my goals, I was gonna have to accept the fact that I can't just make a 'get rich quick' workout plan, but needed to accept that this was gonna be my lifestyle from this point forward. I'd have to be disciplined everyday and go consistantly and it'd be a long time before I saw or felt results and that it was okay. I realized I needed to conquer some mental blocks and demons FIRST! I needed to learn how to be comfortable at the gym, not worry about what people thought of me and most importantly I needed it become a habit. So initially I just focused on that, making it a habit. So for the first month Id mostly just hop on the treadmill and run, maybe do some situps afterwards but that was pretty much it. It was all about building consistancy in the beginning. And then slowly as I was building confidence and a daily routine, I started increasing the amount of exercise; reps, weight and adding new machines, etc. I've now been going pretty consistantly for about 5 months and I'm really proud of myself. I still haven't noticed significant physical changes but I have noticed a lot of mental changes! Which imo is more important. And I'm sure after about a full year, I'll see some physical improvement! I've taught myself that it's okay to not see results right away and to trust the process! Patience is key!", "Re #2: I've been going to a workout class and the lady teaching it asked me how I felt during an exercise.

YTA wow lol", "I sympathize, but YTA. You want her to push herself. But she is new to this, and you're being obnoxious about it. This is likely why she's shutting down.\n\nI had a similar dynamic with my wife early in our relationship when we were dating, and I was the asshole in that situation. I grew up playing lots of sports, and studied Kinesiology, so my relationship to physical activity was very different than hers. I had to adjust to that when doing things together. But after several year of mostly not exercising together, we started jogging together in the summer, and it's been great. I'm far more patient now, and she's far more motivated. You may not intend to, but your judgments are probably making the workout far less enjoyable for her, which is probably why \"it was almost like she shut down\".\n\nI think it's great you've become so active over the past year. But you also sound like you're a bit full of yourself:\n\n>I told my wife about the importance of warming up and doing dynamic stretches before lifting\n\nWarming up, yes, doing dynamic stretches no. There is actually evidence to suggest that  intense stretching may even increase risk of injury, if done immediately prior to lifting. Especially if you're doing any kind of ballistic movements. That being said, I highly encourage doing bodyweight or low weight versions of the exercise you're about to do to warm up. Warming up will definitely help save you and her from injury in the long run.\n\nRemember, you learned to like the burn and the pain of pushing yourself for your own reasons. Likely, you had time to sink into it and give yourself time to appreciate the endorphin/endocannabinoid rush that accompanies intense exercise, and the feeling you get from becoming healthier and stronger. Did you give your wife that chance before you gave her a hard time for not pushing hard enough? On top of that, people really do experience a lot more soreness when they're first getting into exercise, after being more sedentary. I hit this every single spring when I get back into running and my calves start screaming at me. But with time, my body adjusts, and the amount of training I can do picks up significantly over the first couple months of the season.", "What did she say when she \"unloaded\" onto you and was there any truth to what she was saying?", "YTA, you're taking this way too seriously", "YTA.

And I do have some sympathy for this general situation because I've worked out my whole life for various sports and trained for various types of athletic competitions, but my wife will have nothing to do with my suggestions in the gym. I can not be her trainer and I more or less have to ignore her in a gym and work out separately (which fine, that doesn't bother me).\n\nLet's just summarize.\n\n1. Why do you think you get to decide what is enough weight for her? Even experienced trainers rely on feedback from clients on weight, at least until they really know a client, but even then pushing them would be subject to the goal of the client.\n2. And when she doesn't do what you ask or try to force her to do it, you ridicule her as 'gimping out'. \n3. You asked if she was mad, the answer was yes. You should probably open your ears at this point instead of lashing back. \n4. You are still relatively new and clearly ignorant of many training styles, but also super opinionated on the 'right way'. Examples: First, exercise doesn't really have to be 'hard'. It depends on your goals. Light weights and moderate cardio go a long way, especially with diet, and especially in women. Second, I'm 99.9% sure, what ever you call a warm up and dynamic stretches aren't that important. Third, stopping when something hurts is usually the right move.  If it 'hurts' on the 6th rep, you should stop and lower the weight if the goal is to get into the 10-12 rep range. Forth, the difference in hitting 8 or 12 reps is pretty big in terms of what the goal of the exercise is. Ie 12 is likely an endurance goal, 8 is more hypertrophy/strength. I can push (or pull) a good 30% more weight if I only need to do 8 reps instead of 12. So, WTF are you doing with this weight and rep choice in the first place? 8 - 12 is a huge range and 6 is closer to 8 than 8 is to 12, incase you can't do math!", "YTA.
