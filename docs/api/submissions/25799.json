When i (F26) told my moms side of the family that we put an offer for our first home and the offer got accepted, but we still had to wait 3 months. It took us 3 months to complete everything and get the mortage on the house. My family (3 aunts and cousins) congratulated us but not in an happy way. So i thought maybe they were just in a bad mood at that moment. \n\nAfter a month my cousin (F27) told me that her mom, and the other aunts were calling our entire family, even family and people i don't know to tell them that me, my fianc\u00e9 and my mom were liars. That we bought the home with inheritance money that they thought i got (but didn't get) after my father passed away a year before and that we didn't tell them about that money. I asked my cousin why her mom and my aunts would tell such lies behind our back because i never did anything but tell the truth that we were getting the house with a mortgage and our own money. \n\nMy cousin told me that the only way to get my family of our back was to show everyone of them every financial details and our notarial deed. I told her that i would never show them those details because it's our privacy and that i never would have had the audacity to ask them to show their financial details because it's non of my business.\n\nMy family got angrier by the month calling my mom and yelling at her about me and my fianc\u00e9 and began spreading even more lies and trashing my name. One aunt even got so mad at me that when i asked her if she wanted to see our home she didn't want to come inside our filty home because it was disgusting and old (the house was still being renovated at that time) and that she only wanted to come visit when the house was fully renovated. \n\nMy mom didn't tell them to stop with their behaviour because she was afraid to lose her sisters. And at that time i didn't say anything back because i've always kept quiet and i didn't want my mom to chose between me and her sisters. But the gossip and accusations just kept going, so eventually after almost 1,5 year of keeping quiet i just snapped.\n\nI made a group chat because a few of our family members live in other countries. I told them that i've heard everything they said behind our backs and that they were spreading lies. I told them what the truth was and that they not only hurt me, but also my fianc\u00e9 and my mom. I told them that i wanted an apology. \n\nAfter the message they tried to gaslight me that they never did any of those things and that it was all in my head. So i told they should stop right there and just apologies so we can move on or to leave us the f alone. But they couldn't do any of that. So i just told them to f off, stop treating us like sh** and feel ashamed that they as adults couldn't act like freaking adults. We don't talk anymore now and my mom and i both got exiled from our family. They also never stopped to trash my name until this day.

This isn't how a family is supposed to act.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're learning this hard lesson: losers freak out about home ownership. Either they try to move in with you with a mind-blowing justification for their entitlement, nurse a jealousy-born hatred, try to manipulate their way into taking it from you, and some do gossip - because if you could buy yourself a house, what does that say about them, since they can't? Bottom line, just try buying a house and tell a loser about it - then run for cover!", "NTA and nice job with not showing your documents. Fuck them, that\u2019s none of their business.
