Nothing I had said could illicit that response or make sense as a joke reply, it was just random in the middle of a normal conversation. \n\nSo I cracked a joke back and said something along the lines of \u201cyou could never hate me\u201d. She doubled down and says \u201cseriously I hate you\u201d. I take this personally and become offended and ask if she\u2019s just kidding - again she proceeds to say \u201cno I really do hate you, you don\u2019t deserve me\u201d. At this point I make it clear I\u2019m not happy with this and I\u2019m taking it seriously and put an end to the conversation. \n\nShe then comes back to me and says \u201cI was just kidding, you can\u2019t take a joke\u201d. I tell her that\u2019s not a funny joke and I\u2019ve never heard people do that before.

The first time? Maybe a **bad** joke. The second time, the joke quotient went down. And when you told her that you didn't find it funny and she ~~double~~ trippled down on it, it ceased to be a joke. Likely she wanted you to grovel, plead and beg to \"win back her love\". But she is right, you don't deserve her. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nI know some people will playfully tease each other and 'tehe I hate you' is something that can be said, but you tried to clarify if she was joking and she doubled down and even expanded upon it 'you don't deserve me'. \n\nUsually when people joke around with the 'I hate you' kind of joke, it is really obvious they are joking and I would imagine if someone asked if they were being serious they would certainly not continue the 'joke'. \n\nI (31F) actually think it is a bit of a red flag. I get her making a joke - and sometimes they just don't land, but for her to expand and say you don't deserve her makes me iffy about how she will react when she's having a bad day or is unhappy with you. Then instead of apologising for the supposed miscommunication, she throws the blame on you. I would say that the second comment and then the blaming shows that perhaps she doesn't have that much respect for you and I would be nervous to hear what she says when she's angry at you if this is how she acts and speaks on something so small.", "NTA\n\nIt seems like is testing you. Its honestly childish. Your emotions are being played with. Don't date this girl.", "NTA\n\nThat wasn\u2019t a very good joke. If it was a joke, she went too far with it and double-downed after your retort. And then proceeds to gaslight you on top of it. These are red flags. Stay away.", "NTA. People have to understand that not everyone understands their sense of humour. Saying something as definitive as \"I hate you\", and then repeating it in a sincere tone, doesn't give anyone the idea there is a joke involved. I would run as far as possible from this person. They are not interested in your feelings. They sound a little off kilter. This situation is a small sample of what is to come if you stay.", "NTA, the issue isn't the bad joke. It's her unwillingness to take responsibility and apologize for your hurt feelings. That's a problem.", "NTA that\u2019s not even funny", "Nta that is you being gaslit.", "NTA...and if you ask if it's a joke and she says no, then doubles down on it, she's not funny and you need to get away from her.

In short, that was **NOT** a joke and she actually **IS** the bad guy.  It's not funny, wonder what other \"jokes\" she has in store for you.", "I hate when people joke like that. Move on to a new GF.", "NTA. I would think twice about being with someone like that. My girl has said that to me before but it\u2019s after cracking cheesy corny jokes and we both laugh. It never goes further than that. To tell another person they don\u2019t deserve you and claim hehehaha it\u2019s a joke!! Fucked", " NTA.

Usually they pretty quickly talk themselves into being a fucking prick.", "NTA. Did anyone at all laugh??? It wasn't a joke. It was some weird part of her wanting to say that for...some reason? I don't know - but I'd be distancing myself.", "I can't see the humor in this at all. You deserve better, OP! NTA", "NTA. \n\nDiscuss some boundaries with her.", "NTA.  I am assuming you are both adults.  I don't know any adults who act this way or who would consider this type of behavior to be a funny joke.  This sounds like a cruel mind game that does not bode well for a healthy relationship.

She knew what she was doing, especially after she double downed. Take this as you may, but it could be enough of a red flag to not go any further in this relationship", "NTA.

There are people who have relationships like that, where both parties know it's all in silliness (for full disclosure,  my partner and I are like that, as are my brother and his wife. Although both of these relationships span over 30 years). \"  That said, the boundaries in that sort of teasing need to be inviolable, agreed on both sides and carved in stone. Everyone needs to know and respect how far is too far, as well as to say \"I don't have the spoons for sass today.\"\n\nJust beginning to date is WAAAAYYYY too early for that kind of trust, and therefore, too soon for that kind of teasing.  \n\nYou're not remotely out of line.

I'm going with NAH. It's not completely unusual type of flirting by her, though she clearly couldn't read the room when it started getting serious on your part.

Sounds like you're not compatible.", "NAH maybe this is a cultural thing but it's common in my world. When you say something funny someone will say \"I can't stand you\", or \"you are so stupid\".
