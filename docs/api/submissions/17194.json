Judging by the fact that OP talked about the amount in \u00a3\u00a3s, I assume they are in the UK: to deduct funds from a professional pay cheque they'd have to apply for that deduction through the court and it would likely cost more than the debt (unless court costs were awarded by the judge). Plus, WHY should OP give a contract to someone they already know isn't reliable? Why does not wanting to risk their own professional reputation on a dodgy recommendation make them TA? No way, OP you are 100% NTA here. If Dave wanted you to see them as reliable and trustworthy, he'd have paid you back. \u00a35 a week is barely anything - even most high school kids could afford that without leaving themselves short.", "That sounds exactly like what it could be. He just spins circles borrowing from *everyone* and eventually it'll bite him in the ass, but not today apparently. Besides OP refusing to hire him, which is perfectly normal because of what he did. \n\nDepending on the job, would you trust him to not walk away with tools, etc., And how does he talk to and treat other people when he isn't the best to you? These are just things for consideration. He doesn't sound like a *monster*, he does just sound like an idiot, to be completely honest.", "So you would hire some one who can't even give you \u00a35 a week after months of negotiations, and believe they will catch up with actual work deadline? \n\n\nI might be a little innocent baby, but you sure is a big dumbass and naive adult."]}
