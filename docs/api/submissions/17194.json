He's already shown he isn't trustworthy, would you want someone untrustworthy representing you to your customers?", "NTA. \n\nIt shows that Dave is unreliable and doesn't stick to his word. To me that's a red flag, regardless of what profession you're in. Lack of professionalism, unreliable, and dishonest. Not someone I'd want working on my projects.", "NTA. Pretty cheeky of him to come back when he still owes you money.", "NTA\n\nA personal level of trust has been **broken** between you and Dave.\n\nHow do you establish a working relationship with someone who could not pay you back 5 pounds a week? I fail to see beyond that. \n\nI would assume you would be relying on him for work. I wouldn't put my career and my reputation on the line for him.", "NTA for not wanting to help him, he burned you. But I wouldn\u2019t have given him an ultimatum, I\u2019d just tell him you\u2019re not comfortable recommending him because of the incident with the money. if he pays you back you can reassess but I wouldn\u2019t want to recommend someone unreliable to my job.", "NTA Dave has proven himself to be unreliable, why would you want an unreliable worker?", "NTA. It\u2019s reasonable to not trust him as an employee when he\u2019s still got a loan to pay back to you. You\u2019d be protected legally in contract, but it\u2019s the principle.", "NTA. He stole from you and lied, I wouldn't trust someone like that in the workplace.", "  NTA phuq Dave", "NTA. Of course not.", "NTA and he has learnt a valuable lesson. Don't foul your own nest. He knew he would likely need a repeat relationship with you and didn't think it worth \u00a3100 to maintain.
