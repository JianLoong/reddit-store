He's already shown he isn't trustworthy, would you want someone untrustworthy representing you to your customers?", "NTA. \n\nIt shows that Dave is unreliable and doesn't stick to his word. To me that's a red flag, regardless of what profession you're in. Lack of professionalism, unreliable, and dishonest. Not someone I'd want working on my projects.", "NTA. Pretty cheeky of him to come back when he still owes you money.", "NTA\n\nA personal level of trust has been **broken** between you and Dave.\n\nHow do you establish a working relationship with someone who could not pay you back 5 pounds a week?

It\u2019s reasonable to not trust him as an employee when he\u2019s still got a loan to pay back to you. You\u2019d be protected legally in contract, but it\u2019s the principle.", "NTA. He stole from you and lied, I wouldn't trust someone like that in the workplace.", "  NTA phuq Dave", "NTA. Of course not.", "NTA and he has learnt a valuable lesson. Don't foul your own nest.

You could put it in a contract that any outstanding debts will be withheld from the first paycheck. I'm not a lawyer but it seems plausible.", "NTA. I used to work in the trades and had people owe me money for work I did for them, and they would conveniently forget all about it, then ask me for more work to be done, and were always surprised when I told them no and told them why.

I also have an option to not say anything and if I was budgeting 1500$ for the subcontractor I would propose 1400$ to him.  My little innocent babies....

I'd definitely check his track history with his \"previous employment\".\nSee how many people he owes money too...", "Is it worth it to have an employee who you know would not resist stealing or keeping money for himself?\n\nAlso while getting a job is the only way for him to repay the OP, the OP being the employer isn\u2019t the only way.
