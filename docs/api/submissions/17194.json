Literally, there is no excuse not to pay you now.", "Yeah a lawyer who could make such a contract would cost more than the $100, any contract OP makes wouldn\u2019t hold up in court. But let\u2019s say it\u2019s a handshake deal that this guy will pay OP after the first paycheck, and he doesn\u2019t, now OP can\u2019t fire without cause. Easiest solution is to make the guy pay up now because if he doesn\u2019t then he clearly has no intention to do it later", "OP likely wouldn't be able to just deduct the \u00a3100 from his pay though, especially if that would take him under the minimum wage.\n\nI'm not a lawyer so no idea if something could be written up saying \u00a3100 will be deducted from his first pay for the loan given previously that they could both sign, as long as it doesn't take him under minimum wage it might be legal.", "employment law doesn't allow for that.  now, give the Tories another 5 years to finish running the place into the ground, maybe Bob's yer uncle.  but not yet.", "especially since the 100 quid was a private loan, not anything related to work, so legally OP might be forbidden from deducting from pay. \n\nscrew this guy.  block him, and don't ever hire him again.", "It is not OPs company, so your point is moot. The company pays wages, OP hires. They cannot skim off company wages to pay back personal loans.", "Honestly ESH. Learn to say \u201cNo.\u201d and leave it at that. Stop adding qualifiers and allowing yourself to be walked all over. Let the $100 go. But also just tell him that you don\u2019t want to hire him and let that be it. No reasons. No chance to change your mind.", "NTA", "Uh...I think he kinda stole your money. I'm pretty sure it's normal to not hire the person who literally STOLE from you. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhy haven't you blocked him already?!  He showed you his true colors.  You need to grab a bag of NOs to be tossed around when someone else tries to \"Dave\" you."]}
