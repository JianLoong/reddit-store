His wife also has a 16 year old son from a previous marriage. My brother also has a daughter from a previous relationship, Addie (12).\n\nMy brother had not met or spoken to Addie until she had to move in when she was 8 after CPS removed her from her mom's house. Once she got there we learned that she had a strong fear of men and was not going to do well in her dad's house. I'm a single mom with one daughter and we're a 5 minute walk from my brother's house so I offered to take Addie until she got more comfortable with her dad and his family. When she moved in with them I got her the cheapest phone I could find and told her she can come over whenever she wants and to call me so I'll pick her up.\n\nOne thing that's always driven my brother and SIL crazy is that Addie will not call them mom and dad. She has called them Mr and Mrs Lastname since the day she met them. The therapist always said not to force it on her but that didn't stop them from \"strongly encouraging\" it. This made Addie feel uncomfortable at home and start to spend more time at my house. We've been doing at least 3 overnights a week at my house for the past 3.5 years.\n\nWell, I guess my brother and his wife started to see her more as my kid than theirs. They'd all go to the beach and \"forget\" to invite Addie because \"she wasn't here\" or choose family activities that they know she wouldn't like so she'd come back to me.\n\nNow, one of Addie's biggest fears is cats. Nobody understands it and no amount of therapy has been able to fix it but she can not be anywhere near a cat. Well, I guess her dad \"forgot\" about her fear the same way he \"forgot\" to invite her to go out the other day and they came home with a kitten. Addie wasn't told about the kitten and went home to spend the night. She went to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and saw the kitten. She was screaming, which woke everyone up and scared the kitten into running out of the bathroom and caused her dad to get mad at her. He started to yell at her and she ran out the front door at 12:30 at night. Nobody thought to stop her or even see where she was going.\n\nShe ran to my house, woke me up, and told me everything. I couldn't get her to calm down and stayed up all night with her. She finally passed out that morning so I asked my daughter to watch her and went to my brother's house. I screamed at him and his wife, called them horrible parents, and said that this is the reason Addie refuses to call them mom and dad 4 years later. They slammed the door in my face and have refused to talk to me and sent Addie a text saying she has to choose between me and them. She has been a wreck the past few days to the point where I can't leave her home alone. I feel horrible and I'm wondering if I was the asshole for screaming at them.", "created_utc": 1677341074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bog63/aita_for_telling_my_brother_hes_a_horrible_dad/", "score": 3219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Essentially, the parents don't give a shit because she doesn't call them mom and dad.\n\nThis makes the entire family AH except for the children that are too young to understand what is going on.", "YTA. What good was screaming going to do?", "Your brother has a child that he never even tried to have a relationship with until she was forcefully removed from her mother.  They do nothing to make her feel like part of the family but are upset she doesn't call them mom and dad.  They are forcing her to choose between you and them.  They are horrible parents.  She has a problem with men, which probably has something to do with her being removed from her bio mom.  As far as her fear of cats, you may never find out why and there may be no reason, I am terrified of centipedes and caterpillars, totally irrational since I am not afraid of anything else and I have always known they can't really hurt me.  But luckily enough no one is going to surprise me with a pet millipede, forgetting your child is afraid of cats is basically tormenting her.  I am so thankful she has you in her life. NTA at all", "NTA. Not even a little. You hit it on the nose, that\u2019s exactly why she won\u2019t call them mom and dad. The fact they\u2019re now saying she has to choose\u2026. This is what they wanted all along. It\u2019s clear they never wanted her to begin with. She should be where she\u2019s loved and safe, and she already knows you love her and will keep her safe.", "NTA, but please keep us updated if you can. Addie is being abused by your brother. I\u2019d be fighting for custody, especially after they specifically went against therapist\u2019s orders.", "N TA .   THIS IS NOT OK.    I just got my 12 yo back and she has trauma from the fear and yelling, and they also treated her like she was not wanted or an inconvenience. \n\nEmotional abuse is awful and so hard to prove.  Please speak to her about what SHE wants.  \n\nIf she is not ok there encourage her to talk to cps about the situation and actually ask them for help on how to get primary custody. \n\nIt's been about 8 months and my kid is doing better. He gets visitation and she hates it. But she is doing so much better in life since she is now in a safe and loving  home. \n\nGood luck and thank you for being there for her.", "NTA. Holy shit, that poor kid. I can't imagine dealing with that, I'd snap.", "I read some of your comments. Your brother and his wife are abusive to her. If you can you should get her out permanently. See if you can file for adoption or something. Poor girl already had enough trauma. Your brother is such a big asshole.\n\nNTA", "NTA my heart absolutely breaks for her. What a rough life she\u2019s had, of course she\u2019s going to have to issues to deal with. She is so lucky to have you.", "absolutely NTA. They don't want to be this poor child's parents. clearly she has been through a lot and needs patience and they are clearly unwilling to give her that. You should definitely try to get custody of her.", "It looks like no one has taken in the fact that the kid has a lot of mental issues.  First OP has to stop coddling the kid.  Second, get a new therapist, and check to see if the kid is autistic.  After how many years is the kids still calling her dad Mr. Such and such?  Also the cat situation.  Why should the other kids have to suffer not having a cat as a pet?\n\nEveryone is an AH; the therapist, the aunt, and the dad.", "except to be honest it's the dads fault it was hard on him it sounds like. unless he didn't know she existed he made a choice to not be in her life for 8 years. the fact that cps found him implies he was always a terrible parent.\n\nthe fact that cps took a child out of a home and placed them with a literal stranger, who is of the sex she fears (sounds like a trauma based response but that's an assumption), tells me that where she left likely was not safe or stable. and then she was in a home that refused to provide the much needed respite and safe place for her to heal let alone stability that she likely craved, desired and needed for that healing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They could be accused of child endengerment (did i wrote it right?)... \n\nI also wonder if her dad even bothered to see if she eats, if he's buying things...\n\nThe way he acted i think he does more than we know.\n\nI think this is the way you will be able to save her. \n\nYou obviously bonded with her and she obviously thinks you are her safe heaven. \n\nI just read your comments and i don't know if you talked with CPS about letting her run away, the constant sleepovers at your house...\n\nTalk to a lawyer. They aren't fit to be her guardians.\n\nEdit to add judgement NTA but your brother and SIL sure are", "That\u2019s abuse. Plain and simple. There\u2019s no other way to describe this other than abuse.", "Op please call CPS", "Get custody and make your brother pay child support", "Then they're torturing a child on purpose", "OP, I have nothing to add to what everyone has already said, but I couldn't close this post without saying I think you are an awesome human being.  You are making all the difference to that child.\n\nPoor Addie has obviously already been through a huge amount of trauma in her early life and her father is just adding to it.\n\nNext time you give her a cuddle, please give her an extra one from this internet stranger.", "This crosses the line into abuse. That poor kid.  NTA and Addie is lucky to have you.", "Sorry if I sound out of touch here, but was there a specific moment in her life that made her afraid of men?", "The dad literally just said \"either you're the parent or I am\"", "BOTH parents would have to pay child support, not just the father.", "If the sister gets custody, then the child\u2019s father MUST pay child support. He\u2019s legally the child\u2019s father. His sister has no financial responsibility to his daughter \n\nOp, I\u2019m in agreement with most on here. Sue for custody. Her therapist can testify to what\u2019s been happening and the courts will most likely rule in your favor. Not to mention the fact that she\u2019s at an age where she can choose who she lives with. Not sure where you live but it\u2019s about 12 years old in my state \n\nNTA", "You\u2019re making a lot of excuses. \n\nDo you really think Addie\u2019s father was scared that her *waste of DNA mom* would kill him if he took her to the beach with the rest of the family? \n\nOr was he \u201cscared\u201d when he brought an animal into his house that she was afraid of? \n\nSometimes the waste of DNA parent is also the absentee parent. The absentee sperm donor sounds like he enjoys emotionally torturing the girl. It\u2019s becoming a fun hobby for him and his wife.", "OP\u2026. It\u2019s not about the bedtime, the toy, or the kitten. It\u2019s not about those specific things. It\u2019s about the fact they are **emotionally abusing a child** for their own selfish adult wants.", "Her not going there anymore may actually be a blessing in disguise since it seems to be such a toxic environment for her.", "Then you have to take them to court to fight for custody, for the sake of Addie's mental health and sanity.  Poor girl gets no support from her father or stepmother.  Sounds like they just go through the motions of therapy and don't listen to what she has to say about what's bothering her, her fears, or her emotions.  That makes them giant assholes!  She's so lucky to have such an amazing aunt like you!", "Yes. Any non-custodial parent needs to pay child support.\n\n  In this case it's quite possible that the mom should pay child support but simply doesn't because she has no money etc...", "She should just call CPS. \n\nThe girl already has a case file. They know her biological parents are abusive.", "To be fair, in the US if your kids are hauled off to foster care, many parents are required to pay \u2018support\u2019 to the state.", "CPS is surely already involved in her life since she was removed from her biological mother.  The placement with her biological father isn't working out either and OP needs help to protect the child."]}
