His wife also has a 16 year old son from a previous marriage. My brother also has a daughter from a previous relationship, Addie (12).\n\nMy brother had not met or spoken to Addie until she had to move in when she was 8 after CPS removed her from her mom's house. Once she got there we learned that she had a strong fear of men and was not going to do well in her dad's house. I'm a single mom with one daughter and we're a 5 minute walk from my brother's house so I offered to take Addie until she got more comfortable with her dad and his family. When she moved in with them I got her the cheapest phone I could find and told her she can come over whenever she wants and to call me so I'll pick her up.\n\nOne thing that's always driven my brother and SIL crazy is that Addie will not call them mom and dad. She has called them Mr and Mrs Lastname since the day she met them. The therapist always said not to force it on her but that didn't stop them from \"strongly encouraging\" it. This made Addie feel uncomfortable at home and start to spend more time at my house. We've been doing at least 3 overnights a week at my house for the past 3.5 years.\n\nWell, I guess my brother and his wife started to see her more as my kid than theirs. They'd all go to the beach and \"forget\" to invite Addie because \"she wasn't here\" or choose family activities that they know she wouldn't like so she'd come back to me.\n\nNow, one of Addie's biggest fears is cats. Nobody understands it and no amount of therapy has been able to fix it but she can not be anywhere near a cat. Well, I guess her dad \"forgot\" about her fear the same way he \"forgot\" to invite her to go out the other day and they came home with a kitten. Addie wasn't told about the kitten and went home to spend the night. She went to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and saw the kitten. She was screaming, which woke everyone up and scared the kitten into running out of the bathroom and caused her dad to get mad at her. He started to yell at her and she ran out the front door at 12:30 at night. Nobody thought to stop her or even see where she was going.\n\nShe ran to my house, woke me up, and told me everything. I couldn't get her to calm down and stayed up all night with her. She finally passed out that morning so I asked my daughter to watch her and went to my brother's house. I screamed at him and his wife, called them horrible parents, and said that this is the reason Addie refuses to call them mom and dad 4 years later. They slammed the door in my face and have refused to talk to me and sent Addie a text saying she has to choose between me and them. She has been a wreck the past few days to the point where I can't leave her home alone. I feel horrible and I'm wondering if I was the asshole for screaming at them.", "created_utc": 1677341074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bog63/aita_for_telling_my_brother_hes_a_horrible_dad/", "score": 837, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like you need to get custody of the poor girl.", "I have a feeling she'd be way more comfortable calling you her parent- NTA", "NTA and it honestly sounds like your brother and his wife are emotionally abusing/neglecting an already abused and traumatized child and he should not have custody of her at all. What a horrible father.", "NTA and you told them the truth. They can be offended all they want but everything they\u2019re doing points to them not making an effort to include this child that he\u2019s neglected for 8 yrs of her life, into their family.", "NTA if you\u2019re in the position to, please seek legal guardianship of Addi.", "NTA... make sure your brother pays you child support (through college) and covers her medical!", "NTA get any written evidence you can, go to court with all the evidence you can and get legal gaudianship amd child support.  This is terrible behaviour, she needs a safe home.", "Lawyer up and make sure to get child support", "NTA and tell Addie that they are trying to make her feel guilty by making her \u201cchoose\u201d even though they\u2019ve demonstrated with their own actions that they\u2019ve already made their choice. Poor darling. Thank you for standing up for her and actually caring for her.", "NTA she just went from one abusive home to another", "NTA.", "NTA- They're bullies. I hope you can get custody of Addie.", "NTA. That child had it hard enough before being moved to her dad\u2019s house and then was faced with even more callousness and emotionally abuse. I\u2019m glad she has you as her refuge but I would honestly start to look into what can be done for Addie now.", "NTA but honestly this is \"call cps and explain the mental and emotional ABUSE (because that's what this is) that this child is being subjected to.\" territory.  They deserve everything that comes from it and more.", "NTA, someone had to step in. I would go for custody if you can. Your brother and sil are horrible people.", "ESH\n\nYour brother should be more patient and you should be encouraging their bond instead of coming in between.", "NTA they are really abusive. You should adopt Addie n cut them off completely. Also file a child", "If you do seek legal assistance, you should ask about getting a guardian ad litem for your niece. This is an independent lawyer chosen by a judge to represent the child. This is a horrible situation for your niece", "NTA. I'm so glad she has an adult in her life that actually cares about her. She's lucky to have you", "NTA", "NTA, u need to call cps or something, this is messed up. you need to get this poor girl away from your brother.", "NTA. Your brother is a waste of air though.", "NTA at all! My heart just broke for you and your niece  just reading this. Your poor niece. Do everything in your power to get her away from him. But get a lawyer involved.", "NTA - i hate to think this way, but does she get ssi or some other payments that they are taking advantage of? Because if not, they are just terrible humans in general and not just greedy ones. Either way, she needs to be yours. They are repeatedly traumatizing her with every new interaction. You and her need to cut them out completely. She deserves to be loved and respected.", "NTA and you should call children's services and report all of this.", "NTA\n\n\nCPS took her from one abusive household and unknowingly put her into the next.\n\n\nShe's so glad she's got you and I hope you can find a way to properly provide for her (and maybe her AH sperm-donor can provide at least financially.)", "This girl is afraid of men and she's afraid of cats? Is there anything she's NOT scared of? What's wrong with her? She needs to get over her silly phobias ASAP or she will end up very sad and lonely! How is she gonna get a boyfriend and get married and have kids if she's so terrified of males?", "NTA. I just want to swear up a storm in response to your brother and SIL. I CANNOT fathom people like this. It hurts my heart. \n\nI am so glad Addie has you and your daughter looking out for her. I wish she could stay with you and your daughter permanently.", "NTA. Please protect her. Your brother and his wife are horrible and should not be near Addie. Get custody of Addie and take your brother and his wife to court for child support. Thank goodness Addie has you.", "NTA but I\u2019d get a lawyer asap. From your comments it sounds like your brother and SIL are abusing Addie because she won\u2019t call them mom and dad . She basically lives with you half the time anyway and I think she\u2019s safer and happier with you.", "Unpopular opinion here: YTA, but only for confronting your brother in a way that made things worse. You are correct that he's a terrible father. But attacking him for it will only make him worse because, here's the thing: he's a terrible father.\n\nTelling people that they're terrible is almost always an asshole thing to do. (Yes, including right now). Nice people don't need to be told they've screwed up. They already know (and I think you do.) But terrible people will just get mad if chastised. No good comes from it.\n\nYou're obviously on the right track when you focus on getting Addie the best outcome. He'll do whatever he does. You just do the right thing for this vulnerable pre-teen and you'll be fine.", "NTA. Your brother is the AH. I'm glad to hear that this child has a therapist, but am deeply concerned over why she might have such a fear of men", "This poor kid. She's so lucky to have you in her life. \n\n**NTA in the strongest possible terms.  You're a gem.**", "Especially now that they abandoned her.", "NTA. I suggest you request custody/guardianship. That poor girl has had no stability in her life - no wonder she has so many fears. Doing so would show her she has someone who cares. Forget about how your brother feels - her feelings are the most important.", "Are you sure that mom was the only abusive one? Your brother and SIL seems to have targeted his daughter for abuse.", "Holy crap I feel so bad for Addie. I didn\u2019t even have a 6:30 bedtime when i was in preschool, let alone an 8-12 year old. OP, I can\u2019t give you solid advice since I have no idea what your living situation is like but it sounds like you would be a much for fit guardian for this child, maybe see your legal options?", "That\u2019s so abusive. Horrid. I feel so sorry for her, she must be extremely traumatized from both her mom and her dad.", "omg, your brother & SIL are huge abusive a-holes. Can you get custody of poor Addie & cut them out of her life & yours? Your brother deserves a visit from CPS in addition to the dressing down you gave him. \n\nNTA.", "They need CPS calling. This is definitely abuse.", "This is atrocious behavior. How could they treat one of their children this way!? Please please please, if you can take custody of her, do it.", "I deleted my other comment because i suggested to talk to your brother and see if he will ever become a decent father to this child. After reading your comment about the poor girl being punished for not calling them mom and dad, screw talking to him. He won't be. What needs to be done is convince him to sign his rights away. Is it possible to threaten him with calling cps? (Not if this causes problems with Addie, of course, just like a threat or something).", "Call cps on them", "You are going to therapy with her? Oh my gosh he totally leaving it all up to you. NTA", "my family and friends.. you don\u2019t get to mentally abused Addie and get away with it!!!", "I bet they got the cat to make it be an ultimatum situation.", "They should pay OP child support to be her legal guardian.", "That\u2019s just them being passive aggressive for her spending time with OP. What a colossal dick move to a child.", "If she can get her as a kinship placement through the state, they both might get some benefits. Some states even have free college for foster kids. And it would help OP support her better."]}
