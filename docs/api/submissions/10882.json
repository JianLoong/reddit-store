{"id": 10882, "submission_id": "11bog63", "title": "AITA for telling my brother he's a horrible dad?", "selftext": "My brother and his wife have 3 kids, 10m, 7f, 5f. His wife also has a 16 year old son from a previous marriage. My brother also has a daughter from a previous relationship, Addie (12).\n\nMy brother had not met or spoken to Addie until she had to move in when she was 8 after CPS removed her from her mom's house. Once she got there we learned that she had a strong fear of men and was not going to do well in her dad's house. I'm a single mom with one daughter and we're a 5 minute walk from my brother's house so I offered to take Addie until she got more comfortable with her dad and his family. When she moved in with them I got her the cheapest phone I could find and told her she can come over whenever she wants and to call me so I'll pick her up.\n\nOne thing that's always driven my brother and SIL crazy is that Addie will not call them mom and dad. She has called them Mr and Mrs Lastname since the day she met them. The therapist always said not to force it on her but that didn't stop them from \"strongly encouraging\" it. This made Addie feel uncomfortable at home and start to spend more time at my house. We've been doing at least 3 overnights a week at my house for the past 3.5 years.\n\nWell, I guess my brother and his wife started to see her more as my kid than theirs. They'd all go to the beach and \"forget\" to invite Addie because \"she wasn't here\" or choose family activities that they know she wouldn't like so she'd come back to me.\n\nNow, one of Addie's biggest fears is cats. Nobody understands it and no amount of therapy has been able to fix it but she can not be anywhere near a cat. Well, I guess her dad \"forgot\" about her fear the same way he \"forgot\" to invite her to go out the other day and they came home with a kitten. Addie wasn't told about the kitten and went home to spend the night. She went to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and saw the kitten. She was screaming, which woke everyone up and scared the kitten into running out of the bathroom and caused her dad to get mad at her. He started to yell at her and she ran out the front door at 12:30 at night. Nobody thought to stop her or even see where she was going.\n\nShe ran to my house, woke me up, and told me everything. I couldn't get her to calm down and stayed up all night with her. She finally passed out that morning so I asked my daughter to watch her and went to my brother's house. I screamed at him and his wife, called them horrible parents, and said that this is the reason Addie refuses to call them mom and dad 4 years later. They slammed the door in my face and have refused to talk to me and sent Addie a text saying she has to choose between me and them. She has been a wreck the past few days to the point where I can't leave her home alone. I feel horrible and I'm wondering if I was the asshole for screaming at them.", "created_utc": 1677341074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bog63/aita_for_telling_my_brother_hes_a_horrible_dad/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They'd take the kids out and buy all of the kids toys but Addie couldn't get one unless she called them mom and dad. She had a very early bedtime (started getting ready for bed at 6:30 every night) and was only allowed to stay up until a normal time for her age if she called them mom and dad.

Then he has the audacity to demand she call him dad when he doesn\u2019t act like one. Astounding. \n\nNTA. This poor child went from one abusive home to another. Why would anyone treat their child like this? I don\u2019t know what your recourse is here, but I\u2019d speak with an attorney. There has to be some way to help her. You\u2019re a good aunt. I\u2019m glad Addie has at least one person in her life who actually cares about her.", "Calle cps on them and speak with a lawyer! It would be even better when you Had recordings of this abuse (because all of that is nothing Else. Getting nothing If you dont call someone who was never nice to you Mom or dad?!?) to prove it and adopt her without him actively signing the parental rights away, but i dont know how the laws are where you are.", "If you are willing to do that, I'd have a consultation with a lawyer. Since there is obvious abuse and neglect and she is at an age where she can weigh in and give her perspective of the situation, maybe he could be stripped from his parental rights, if CPS gets involved. And since you can prove that you have provided a safe place for her and already have a relationship with her, she spends a lot of time at your house, I'm guessing you can provide for her basic needs (food, clothing, a roof over her head) etc. maybe you could adopt her easier.

Way better,  by the sound of things", "Also,talk to the girls therapist to see if their willing to testify on your behalf.", "What exactly did she do apart from protect the poor kid?", "Can you explain what exactly OP did wrong?", "Honestly you should talk to a lawyer about all this. You may be able to convince your brother to sign over rights with the threat of it going to court. Also child abandonment on his part.", "She didn't protect the poor kid in this situation.  That's the point. There was 0 benefit to telling off the dad.", "She handled it in a way that makes the situation worse not better.  Telling people off, really never makes things better on the other side.  It's an emotional action that feels good at the moment but is nothing but baggage on the backside.", "Or at least have your brother pay some child support.", "What is worse than live with people who dont like her? Now she can stay with OP because her \"father\" gave an ultimatum. OP did the best thing she could and Addie will only have benefits if she loses contact with the real Ahs of the post.\n\nNTA"]}
