I have been here for over 20 years, longer than anybody else living here. First, to explain the parking here, there are small parking lots located throughout the complex, with assigned spots. I have two large Cadillac's and pay for three parking spots to ensure that nobody can hit them when they park their vehicles.\n\nIn the spring two women moved into one of the houses beside me. I thought they were sisters, but found out they were mother and daughter. Mother doesn't look much over 40 and the daughter looks like she's in her early 20s. I don't know their actual ages, but they look close enough in age to be sisters. Anyway, that's not the point of this story.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, we had the first of a couple of major snowfalls. The snow plow came, so I moved my cars to the two visitors parking spots to make sure my spots got cleared. Mother and daughter both moved their cars to the street and waited for the snow plow to finish. The daughter's assigned parking spot is directly beside mine, so she parked beside one of my cars.\n\nI realized a few hours later that she parked in one of my parking spots. So I went to their house and told her to move her car because she was messing up my spots. She slammed the door in my face and a couple of minutes later, I knocked on the door and front windows again. I had to keep up the knocking until she eventually stormed out to her car. She moved it over while her mother started screaming at me. \"She's autistic!\" \"You take up a million spots with your stupid cars!\" Stuff like that.\n\nA few days later the mother came out while I was outside and said if I screamed at her daughter like that ever again she would call the police. I didn't scream at her, I was just explaining the parking situation to her while she was walking to her car. But since she was already mad, she must have told her mommy I was screaming.\n\nEditing to add that the mother said she \"saw me get in her daughter's face\" and intimidate her. Also wanted to say that her excuse was that she couldn't see the lines because of the snow. It sounds like this girl should get rid of her car entirely and just have her mom drive her around. Her car is filled with stuffed animals. It looks like a child's car.\n\nI also don't know much about autism, but can people with autism even drive?

No need to talk loudly to get your point across.\n\nAutism is a social developmental issue, it has 0% to do with intelligence.

However, some people with autism might also have other disorders including intellectual disabilities. But having an ID does not automatically mean you can\u2019t drive a car. Everything depends on level of functioning and ability to understand driving rules, etc. Everything is on a spectrum.

How disastrous is it really when she parked there one time and potentially accidentally. On the scale of *not* to *Hiroshima*, how bad was het mistake?\n\nOn the autism question; autism (or ASD) is a spectrum. It varies from complete 'off this world' to highly functioning individuals. ADD and ADHD are also in the spectrum. Many people with autism (myself included) you wouldn't notice. In the old days my version would be referred to as Asperger syndrome (now AS). And even those with AS have it in various degrees. We recently found out my wife (42f) was diagnosed with it as well. \n\nIn general, people with autism process impulses differently. Some get easily overloaded, some have hard times reading emotions or dealing with stress. Some show repetitive behavior, most don't. Some of us easily learn how to behave when they get explanations on how to behave. \n\nIf you see Sheldon Cooper in the Big Bang Theory (TV show) you will see a (very exaggerated version) of someone with AS. This is NOT how most are, but just an example. \n\nTo question if someone with autism is allowed to drive is not really a good question. It's like asking is people with blue eyes are allowed to drive. Most are, some aren't. Of you want to learn more about autism, look it up on Wikipedia. \n\nRegarding your neighbor (the daughter), she may have not been able to grasp your anger and taken your comment for a notice.

I have known men to have all sorts of stupid S++t in their cars, but being a man this is never questioned.\n\nIt wouldn't do you any harm to be more neighbourly either.

They get legitimate college degrees and own businesses. This encompasses any high functioning handicaps not just Autistic people. And in my particular area, there\u2019s more physically and mentally handicapped people working 40 hours a week while healthy people find corrupt doctors to put them on RSDI while they work cash jobs like construction owned by family. It\u2019s sad really.", "I'm arab, not white.", "Just asking \u201ccan someone with autism even drive\u201d is ableist. Ableism noun: discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities. \n\nI could be ageist and say someone who is 64 shouldn\u2019t be having the temper tantrum of a toddler about a parking space, but I\u2019ll refrain.", "Little girl? You said she was in her 20's... that is both a disgusting comment, and an extremely disrespectful one.", "if they\u2019re cars, they aren\u2019t big enough to require 1.5 spaces. you\u2019re just an entitled AH. if you can break the rules and park in visitor spots who are you to pound on a woman\u2019s WINDOW after she closed the door on your? hypocritical, entitled AH", "You may have forgotten this due to your advanced age and possible senility, but when you get a driver's license, you have to take a test. This test includes a written portion and a practical portion. If a person is incapable of performing all tasks related to driving then they do not get a license. If a person can safely drive during their test, then they are deemed capable and given a license. No part of a driving test checks for neurodivergence.\n\nAs for my judgment, YTA. Your neighbor likely felt intimidated because an older man spoke loudly (yelled) while close to her (into her face). This is an intimidating and aggressive behavior and I would likely have shut the door in your face as well. I'm sure things would have been different if you had come up to her and nicely mentioned their mistake and asked her to move.", "My old condo's response for parking disputes is this:  \n\n\n1) Notify offending car's owner of misparked vehicle. Knock on the door, phone call it didn't matter. We even had forms to put under their windshield wiper. If you left your car in someone else's spot, they tagged it, and you didn't notice... not their problem. You called the office to start the clock.  \n2) Wait 6 hours (Yes was in HOA bylaws. Upon notification they had 6 hours to move their car.)  \n3) Call Empire Towing. Give space number # and condo #. They look it up in their magic book. If correct they dispatched a truck.\n\n4) Watch the waterworks when people get towed because they think they're entitled to someone else's PAID FOR parking spot.   \n\n\n Ya it really sucked to have someone parked in your spot for 6 hours... but most people were oblivious to the, move it or else flyer under their windshield wiper, so most of the time they got towed. There were signs EVERYWHERE, park in assigned spaces ONLY all others will be towed. They had tons of visitor spaces so it wasn't like they had more than 50-60 ft extra to walk to most condos.\n\nRegardless of what the OP's response to them yelling at OP they were notified of a violation of HOA issued parking spots. Regardless of how creepy they thought he was, they signed the same paperwork everyone else did. They knew that wasn't their spot.   \n\n\nESH to all for badly handed interactions. \"Please move your car from MY assigned PAID spot, thanks\"... would have done wonders I'm sure. As we know or else comes later..", "You're definitely not.  Pretty sure my mom's Palisade is far nicer then either of his cars.", "It might not have anything to do with her parking, but it could definitely have something to do with her slamming the door, especially if he was being aggressive.", "You still don't go banging on peoples windows and then follow them out to their car ??? After they've already closed the door on you. Thats psycho behaviour. Call a tow truck, don't harass a family. Jesus Christ.", "You still don't go banging on peoples windows and then follow them out to their car ??? After they've already closed the door on you. Thats psycho behaviour. Call a tow truck, don't harass a family. Jesus Christ.", "Redditors often have the most unreasonable expectations and judgements that ebb and flow like the tide.  Today it's he's ableist and shouldn't scream at autistic girls, tomorrow it'll be autistic people don't get a pass for being autistic and he didn't yell.\n\nOP clearly doesn't know about autism, being ignorant on a subject and discussing with strangers doesn't make him an ahole.  I thought the dude was making an open ended question because he didn't really know.  But, redditors will do what redditors do, in this case, eviscerate the mean old bad guy with too many parking spots.", "Tbh I believe you're more of a hazard on the road than an autistic person. Because you're old and also an asshole. YTA.", ">the mother was waiting with 911 on speed dial just in case.\n\nI wouldn't either, but at that same time it still seems weird that she'd have her autistic daughter answer the door..... a second time. One time and I 100% agree with you, but twice? Youre daughter already obviously feels threatened so either call the police or answer the door yourself... or just wait for him to fall asleep on their porch, lol.", "no one is ever happy.  \nfor the people that are suggesting that they should\u2019ve just towed m the car. then a bunch of  you would complain bout that", "I'm usually not sure if people are trolling or not, but holy shit, this screams of trolling. You come in Reedit and make clearly offensive comments about a disability that is fairly common and easily google-able and then when someone tried to make you sound sort of reasonable, you shoot back with a comment that makes you sound even more aggressive. I hope to God you are a troll and don't exist like this in the real world.", "You might like to look at the comment to which I was replying, and then consider that I didn't defend either of the neighbors \u2013 not the poor parking, nor the slamming of the door. I was responding to someone who suggested that a young woman who was unnerved by a grown man pounding on her doors and windows and then following her as she walked to her car should *obviously* feel \"TOTALLY SAFE\", and since she didn't, she was clearly incapable of handling the stress of driving.\n\nNo, being a woman doesn't give you a pass to be rude \u2013 and it bugs the hell out of me when people park over the line and take up multiple spots \u2013 but men should be capable of remembering that, sometimes, their behavior might come across as threatening to women, even when they don't intend it to. Possibly more so when, as in this case, the man is a mature adult and the woman is a young woman.\n\nOh, and also, \"MAKE\" him pound on his neighbor's door and windows? No one held a gun to his head, and he's not a brainless automaton incapable of deciding on his own course of action but compelled to do what he set out to do with no deviation, so it isn't the case that anyone 'MADE' him do that; he chose to, just as he chose to then follow the neighbor as she walked to her car. He chose to do that because he was pissed. The neighbors shouldn't have slammed their door in his face, but his response was up to him.", "I can\u2019t wait for round two: AITH for screaming at two women for getting my cars towed while I parked illegally? *I\u2019ve lived here longer so I have the right to do whatever I want and no one seems to respect those rights* :(", "The weirdest part is that they claimed to be 64. What kind of 64 year old man types like this? Sloppy world-building and hacky writing like this makes me wonder who believes this.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
