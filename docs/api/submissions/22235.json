If asked why you moved you can tell the story and let people draw their own conclusions.", "NTA.... just own it.  'why did you tell everyone that i'm crazy'... \"because you are\"", "NTA.  Why did you have to move to another room and not her?  Did she not notice that someone else already lived there when she moved in?", "NTA.\n\nRoommates do act really crazy for no reason and the lengths they can go is unimaginable until you experience such situations like your case.\n\nSince you get to word spreading already, maybe stop talking about her more tho. No need to be a bully just for the sake of it. Stay away from the ex-roommate, good luck with your next one.", "No one ruined her college life except herself for being...well, crazy. NTA", "NTA\n\n>One of my friends think I was an asshole because I could potentially ruin her college life by foing this\n\nExcuse me, a girl gets assigned to your room as your new roommate, opens the door and starts screaming at you and falls on the floor still screaming. I'm not sure if you're a guy or a girl but the former would've been horrible if someone thought otherwise of you due to her screaming. *Your* life would be ruined if she said anything else. Keep in mind all the shit she's done from opening the door to going to the class RA or someone and telling wrong things about you could've ruined your reputation. So it's only fair you tell how crazy she is. And you didn't have to tell much, considering how many people saw the temper tantrum she pulled. Your friend is an AH for thinking you're the AH.", "NTA she could have potentially ruined your college life by spreading the opposite rumor. Because if not she will spread that you scared her on purpose and are a bad person and etc. Plus depending on how crazy she could even escalate it further. By getting ahead of it and actually setting the record straight you can remove some of that harm from you. And its not like you lied (unless the post is mostly fabrication but having lived in dorms I know people do actually act like that lol) so I think you have a leg to stand on. Though maybe dont call her names just explain the situation and call the situation crazy and let other people make the connection to her being crazy. It brings alot less heat onto your self just incase she wants to say she slandered you or something.", "You should have reported her in writing to the college authorities as needing medical help and why. She's unstable.\n\nIt may not have been nice to call her crazy to everyone, but she does need help. Your friend expects too much. And her behavior was not okay.", "I wonder if she's playing the long game to get a single for the double occupancy rate.", "LOL NTA she\u2019s gonna ruin her own college life acting like that. Keep telling people she\u2019s crazy", "why would you be removed from a room you\u2019re already established in? why wouldn\u2019t she be the one to move if she literally JUST moved in?", "NTA\n\nShe is either crazy or entitled/manipulative. Or both.", "Nta she sounds like she was has mental health issues or she was faking to get her own room. Either way I think your description is accurate.", "NTA.\n\nTrust me. If more than 4 people saw that scene, she is going to be known as crazy regardless of your actions.", "Nta\nShe really sounds like she needs mental health care", "NTA", "NTA. She's not crazy, she's controlling. She manipulated the situation to get a solo room. Screaming for an audience and then taking a dive is pure manipulation. Lying to the person in charge is pure manipulation.\n\nStay clear of her. She's pure trouble you don't need in your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have every right to share about your experience with her/why you moved rooms. \n\nThat being said, if you feel like you're going out of your way to share with people who hardly/don't even know her, it could easily be veering into unnecessary gossip territory. I'm glad you were able to get moved into another room and didn't have to keep living with her through the whole semester.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure she was trying to scare YOU so you'd change rooms", "No one is responsible for your own happiness. It comes from within. Whoever is telling you that you are TAH is a snowflake that needs to be toughened up. I\u2019m sure they never had siblings either lol \nShe ruined it for herself, not you. You were the victim of her crazy shit.", "YTA - she clearly has issues and that\u2019s bad luck for you getting a randomised roommate, but you going around telling everyone that she\u2019s crazy is what makes you TA. It\u2019s just mean.\n\nI would\u2019ve walked away and reported the incident so staff can deal with it and provide a solution to the matter. You can still be in shock while getting help so it\u2019s hard to imagine you were frozen during this whole hysterical ordeal but also waiting for her to get out of the way so you can get into your room. \nIf I find someone screaming out of control and throwing themselves on the floor, I\u2019d go get help. I would certainly be the one asking for a room change, and not wait for her to do that. Something doesn\u2019t add up with your story telling.", "YTA and I\u2019m shocked at how many people say otherwise. \n\nShe was obviously in the middle of a massive mental health crisis. I understand why you\u2019d want nothing to do with her now but you still don\u2019t need to call her ableist names and gossip about her to everyone. \n\nTry a little empathy.", "NTA. This girl is ruining her college life perfectly fine on her own, you aren't doing anything to her.", "NTA.
