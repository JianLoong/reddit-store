That is on YOU.\n\n\ud83e\udd23 So dramatic! And so wrong too, adults are  responsible for their own decisions. Shocker, I know.", ">If you had an embarrassing moment and someone decided to yell it on a bullhorn to anyone and everyone they met,\n\nIf my 'embarrassing' moment was me screeching like a banshee and throwing myself on the floor, while repeating the same shit for 2 hours like I'm fucking Gollum from Lord of the Rings, I would expect people to avoid me at all cost, because clearly I am unstable as shit and could fly off the handle at any given moment at the slightest infraction.\n\nYou are right that she needs help. Help in an asylum.", "Her mental health crisis does not trump her lying to get her kicked out of her own dorm room which was already set up. Yeah empathy is fine if the girl apologized but from my point of view she decided to act like that because she wanted a single room, because if not then after a conversation the situation should have resolved it self. But the lady decided to wait until the next morning (so had a night to think about what happened) and then still decided to lie and get the OP kicked out. So its not like the lady did all this on the spur of the moment nor did she not have time to calm down (2 hours of yelling). Also her being surprised is pure bullshit because she would have been told by an RA and what every dorm acceptance form she had to sign that she had a room mate. If anything else went wrong the OP would the one in a whole soup of trouble. The OP is lucky it ended where it did and she can just call her crazy. Especially because the rumors could have worked out against the OP and she could have been the only person blamed for the situation.", "Her crisis is not his problem. She also lied and manipulated the dorm official. NTA.", "this!", "Good explanation!", "I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s a very different second side to the story.", "Bot stole this comment from u/garlic_potatoes18", "She could have had a bigger/nicer room. Maybe it was closer/farther to the bathroom. Perhaps it was a better configuration or view.\n\nDorm rooms are not the same. She could have coveted the room for any number of reasons and then game planned to get the room.\n\nThat Def seems believable.", "> So why did they have to move rooms, and not the person who was screaming?\n\nIt's student housing, squeaky wheel gets the grease. No one cares or wants to deal with your crap so if OP didn't put up a huge fight, they'd have him move.", "Part of me is struggling with it a little, but then I remember how incompetent my college housing department is and can't help but believe in the possibility. They almost forced me to move within an hour of returning from break because I came to discover a great deal of mildew and then spent almost a month not having it properly dealt with and lying to me about it. They often changed summer housing assignments last minute and left people scrambling, and you always had to check their work on the bill.", "Not all RA's are great at their responsibilities.", "My college roommate threatened to kill me because someone reported her for having a kitten in the dorm. She thought it was me (it wasn't), called me from a party, and told me I better not be there when she got back. I'm the one who had to move out. Then something similar to OP's story happened; I got my new room assignment, and when I showed up with my first cart full of stuff, the person in that room went ape and said her friend was moving in and I couldn't live there.", "I also work in college housing, the only thing saving me from disbelief is they mention it might not be a US or other English speaking country.", "I worked for a college housing department that lurched from self inflicted crisis to self inflicted crisis, alternating between shocking gross incompetence and major criminality. It\u2019d take a lot for a story about college housing to surprise me.", "> I tried to open the door with my keys but before I could do that a girl opened the door and started to scream.\n\nTry again", ">I tried to open the door with my keys but before I could do that a girl opened the door and started to scream\n\nNo, she didn't. The screamer opened the door.", "Nta, that\u2019s one way to guarantee you will not have a roommate", "And now, because she got her way, that behavior is reinforced as the way to get what she wants.  She is the lady we see online recording people for \"harassment\" simply because they had the nerve to walk beside her.  Or she is the person that is making a scene in a restaurant because you told her you are out of Ranch.", "\"Crazy\" removes the agency from her actions and makes it sound like she didn't decide to be a harassing weirdo asshole. It's also more ambiguous- the crazy girl in my dorm had poorly managed ADHD and talked a bit much but also was a decent person overall. This person... is not.\n\nDescribing what happened and letting people conclude as they will is going to be more damning than just calling her crazy.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s actually crazy\u2026she\u2019s manipulative. I mean, she acted a certain way and got what she wanted.", "Totaly bonkers", "RIGHT.", "No you don\u2019t, you\u2019re a bot using a stolen comment.", "people really need to lay off the true crime podcasts \ud83d\ude02", "Right? \n\nAn embarrassing moment being\u20262 hours of screaming lol. An embarrassing moment is something like farting during a presentation, not acting like she did", "agree", "No. There are people like this. My sister is one of them.", "If they're lying about everything, sure, but this wouldn't be an appropriate reaction in pretty much any semi-normal event. I guess if OP failed to mention they were dressed like Michael from Friday the 13th, blade and all, that's a key part out.", "then she should be happy with the label \"crazy\". Noone would want to room with her after that. Win-win for her.", "As someone who has worked in Housing for a number of years we usually try not to handle a situation like this which would \u201creward\u201d the behavior that was expressed in the OOP. I believe this may be a foreign country so not sure what best practices are where the situation took place, but Screamer would be placed in temporary housing and then relocated to- oops, we only have half filled doubles available! Then give her some options of already half-occupied rooms.", "So you agree they are bat shit crazy. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "It is a crazy person, not someone known for logical thought processes", "i guess. you cant just like tell everyoneeeee the story thoigh. easier to say crazy", "I mean, very true, but I guess you could say \"Yo, this girl is beyond deranged and needs some medical intervention because she's going to stab someone in her sleep\".\n\nBut saying 'crazy' is a little quicker, lol", "But it IS crazy to act like this even manipulatively.  Like, you'd have to be seriously unhinged to pick that as your main strategy for getting what you want.", "Screaming bloody murder to essentially force someone to swap rooms as a manipulation tactic is crazy. No other way around that.", "play stupid games win stupid prizes. act crazy? ok imma tell people \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If you think screaming at the top of your lungs for five minutes straight in a college dorm because you got a new roommate is not crazy then something is off with you", "Lol then she deserves to be punished.", "Nah, anyone who acts that unhinged definitely has some bats in the belfry.   Plus, both things can be true!  She can be crazy and also intentionally manipulate the people around her to get what she wants.", "YOU ARE 100% RIGHT.", "You can be crazy **and** manipulative", "I actually say the exact same thing about my proctologist", "Manipulative, crazy, tomato, tomato.", "plus given how the story was told, she did all this in public.\n\nShe ruined her own reputation long before OP could do anything.", "Anyone you would call her crazy to probably would prefer to hear the story. Again, there's type of crazy. Did try to get you to OD at a party or did she have a weird crush on a professor, because those are very different things.", "She was probably acting that way in the hopes that the OP would ask for the room change.\n\nEdit: but I get your point", "And we mustn\u2019t forget that she did this in front of multiple people, not just in front of OP.\n\nAnd I would bet 1 million dollars that they all spread the story about the crazy girl screaming for five minutes\u2026\n\nI know I would have.\ud83d\ude01", "valid. that\u2019s why id open w crazy or something like that to get a story going", "Acting or not, it's crazy to think like that and think it'll be beneficial without repercussions", "Proper batshit mate", "and acting this way to get something is proper crazy.", "Yeah, I usually want to have empathy for people going through it. And it hate people being mislabeled with mental health issues. But that is what I feel comfortable calling \u201ccrazy\u201d behavior. People should have a heads up."]}
