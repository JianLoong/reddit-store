{"id": 16139, "submission_id": "134o51q", "title": "AITA for not supporting my wife when (I think) she's being aggressive?", "selftext": "Recently my sister (Jane F33) and her fianc\u00e9 (Sally F29) came to have dinner with me (M35) and my wife (F35).\n\nWhile preparing dinner we got into an argument. Jane and Sally have said they do not want dogs at their wedding reception, which is a 2 day event (with family staying an extra day) about 2 hours away from where we live. That's fine but it makes things challenging for us because we have a large dog that's difficult to handle and we don't currently have anyone we can trust to leave him with.\n\nThe argument started because Jane felt hurt that we were not prioritising her wedding, we'd said we may not be able to attend the entire 3 days due to the no dog policy.\n\nDuring the argument my wife got angry. I will try to describe what I observed in the most neutral way possible. What I saw was that:\n\n* she raised her voice, well above the volume that everyone else was using\n* stood (when everyone else was sitting)\n* repeatedly and vigorously pointed at Sally to emphasise her words (continuing even after Sally said that the      pointing made her uncomfortable and to please stop)\n* spoke over other people\n* escalated the argument by interpreting what Jane and Sally were saying in the most negative way possible (for example saying that their attitude to accommodation at the wedding was an      example of them diminishing her status as a member of the family)\n\nThe result of this was that both Jane and Sally left in tears before we'd eaten.\n\nLater, my wife wanted to know why I had not supported her during the argument, by chipping in more to point out when Jane and Sally had been saying unreasonable things. \n\nI was also very angry and disappointed. I told my wife that it didn't seem like she needed any support, since she was arguing perfectly well for herself. I thought her behaviour was so aggressive that it doesn't really matter if she was right or wrong; however unreasonable people are being, you can't speak to them that way.\n\nShe says that I am unfairly judging her, that I am biased against her and that her behaviour was not aggressive.\n\nAITA for not supporting my wife?\n\nOther things that might be relevant:\n\n* Jane & Sally do not know that our dog is reactive to other dogs (which makes it difficult to leave him with others) - we've not told them because my wife thinks they will judge us for it\n* My wife believes that race forms a part of the disagreement, Sally, Jane and I are white, my wife is brown and she thinks that we are applying an angry black woman stereotype \n* My wife comes from an abusive background and is *extremely* sensitive to anything that feels like she's being excluded as a result of this trauma\n* This is not the only time my wife has been frustrated about me not backing her up in arguments. She is definitely a lot more comfortable with conflict than I am but I genuinely think in most cases that I didn't back her up because I actually didn't agree with her. She believes that it is my role to back her up regardless of whether I agree or not.", "created_utc": 1682951606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134o51q/aita_for_not_supporting_my_wife_when_i_think_shes/", "score": 244, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If dogs were allowed, there would probably be other dogs too and your dog could end up disrupting the event. If you're staying overnight, I would think the obvious compromise would be to stay at a pet friendly hotel, leave the dog there during the event and take turns leaving the event to walk the dog. You're not an AH not backing up your wife on this, but you are for letting her escalate this when bringing the dog to the wedding was never an option", "YTA for letting it get to that point.

You should not back up spouses and friends when they are so clearly wrong. That just leads to escalation and turns everything into a war between factions.", "NTA, your wife sounds unhinged\n\nWho even thinks that a dog might be welcome at a wedding?

NOT reasonable, unless the hotel has dog sitting facilities...? \n\nYou may want to reassure your wife that you love her tremendously and are aware of her trauma, but maybe she could use a bit of therapy to address her past trauma, and that while it's your job to support your wife, sometimes that support is pointing out that she's in the wrong.", "YTA for not standing up for your sister and allowing your wife to mistreat her.", "You are an AH, but not for the reason you wrote in about. Your wife is also definitely an AH as well. \n\nAssuming you love and support your sister, you should be able to attend and fully participate in her wedding. Sure, there are lots of things that get in the way of that- price of travel, limited days off from work, child care, etc- and people should know their wedding isn't the end all be all of the universe. However, if I heard my sibling might not be able to attend my wedding in full because of their pet, I would also be hurt, because...come on. \n\nYour wife, from your own account, escalated a disagreement and you let your sister and fiance leave in tears. Your wife is right you should have stepped in, but to stop the argument, not to agree with her. \n\nNo, couples do not need to back each other up no matter what. You can disagree as gracefully as possible, but if my partner did the actions you describe, I would have stepped in right away and had them exit the conversation. Something like \"this is getting too heated, I would like to separate this now\" is a fine intervention that doesn't take sides and your wife would only feel like you weren't on her side because SHE is the one behaving badly. \n\nAnd standing up, pointing at people, and yelling over everyone could certainly be a cultural issue (different cultures and even families have different expectations around communicating), but it is not purely a race one. And we ALL have to adapt to the style of those we are communicating with- and that goes both ways. \n\nAnd when you think about this, it is about a dog. A dog that you don't have trained properly, that your wife won't let you tell people isn't trained properly, and a dog that sounds like a lot. So your sister is in tears, you may not go to her wedding, your wife is now mad at you and thinks your family is racist and you don't support her...and the center of that is a dog?\n\nI'm going with ESH, but I don't mean your sister and her fiance here.", "NTA: OP, It sounds like your wife blew right past assertive to aggressive & hostile. You sister & fiancee perceived the anger and not any logical message. \"Attack mode\" is not useful for anything other than expressing scorched earth anger. You did not share the anger, and cannot be expected to support that message.", "Info requested- When you say no matter how unreasonable people are you shouldn't yell, is that your stance on racism? \nHave they been racist to your wife and you've said this?\n\nIt's not unreasonable to not want dogs at the wedding. It is unreasonable to expect 3 days away from home from people with obligations like pets. \n\nI feel like there's some major info being left out here.", "You back her up in public and discuss it in private. You don't have to agree with her but you do have to stand by her.

I think the theme of their wedding was \u201ccamping\u201d so it made sense.", "If wife and OP are Ahs then its ESH", ">Obviously she was wrong to shout at them and point, but that\u2019s not actually the question at hand.\n\nPart of the central conflict but sure brush over it and instead attack the husband", "I am a serious pet person and I would never consider bringing a pet to a wedding!", "Exactly. I\u2019m willing to bet that the only reason this rule even had to be made is because of OP\u2019s poorly trained dog being brought everywhere. I would be very surprised if the sister and her fiance needed to tell any other guests about this rule at all.", "JFC they are going to a wedding not Old MacDonald\u2019s Farm. Surely somewhere in the 2 hours between the OP\u2019s home and the venue there is a boarding kennel where they can put their mutt for a couple of days.", "Then he would get shat on for being a controlling husband who has a leash on his wife lmao. He can't win", "Much easier said than done, when emotions are running high there's not a lot that can be said to make someone come back down.\n\nThe words you took the time to write could even still be interpreted as \"you're supporting sister over me, your wife\" in the heat of the moment and actually escalate the situation further.", "My partner and I both love our dogs, we\u2019ve owned quite a few throughout our lives, but we didn\u2019t incorporate the dogs into our wedding.  \n\nEven our (admittedly favorite) dog during that time- Arthur a Newfie - would doubtlessly be stressed and overstimulated despite being the calmest, gentlest and most well behaved dog. Why would a wedding guest, much less one with a poorly trained reactive dog, want their dog to be in this situation?", "i had a rescue German Shepherd that was dog aggressive and one that was not, but they got along well. Our other GSD was the only dog that the rescue could be around without attacking. We always boarded them at a place that kept them together and knew what was up so they let them exercise in the yard alone. They also let the calm one go play with other doggos and the owner used their own dogs to try and help socialize our rescue. It never worked but the rescue came to trust the humans there and was happy to be boarded.", "If he did he would be shat on by this sub for controlling or sm shit. He can't win", "On AITA we hold the husband accountable to the actions of an AH wife because it means we can reduce blame on the wife. /s", "As someone whose toddler nephew attempted to undress himself at her wedding, this one really strikes home.", "Why did nobody ask for the raccoon tax :') lmao", "It's not just some random 3 day party.

Suggesting that she is incapable of not yelling and being aggressive is treating her like a child or an animal.", "He could be an enabler...................OR he could be abused spouse.\n\nI think the wife is an abusive person, abusive emotionally and possibly physically.\n\nHis inability to interfere with the wife's behavior indicates he is caught  up in a toxic abusive marriage.", "That's not how this subreddit works. YTA means only OP is an AH and everyone else is not an AH.  Read the vote definitions if you don't believe me.", "That\u2019s surprising, most kennels in my area won\u2019t take dogs who aren\u2019t human-friendly. Their employees need to be able to handle the dogs without worrying about getting bitten.", "And I\u2019m sure you received a lot of compliments on your attire!", "I truly want to believe that one was real. Pebble at least sounds better well-behaved than OP's hell hound. I don't wouldn't want a dog or pet racoon at my wedding,  but at least the racoon is a different level or crazy and an awesome future story. I bet Pebble did look great in his bow tie.", "You're assuming a lot about me there and you're very incorrect but you do you.\n\nI've been to several weddings in my time including that of siblings and whilst I enjoy attending, I would not jeopardize the care of my dog in order to attend one.
