{"id": 16139, "submission_id": "134o51q", "title": "AITA for not supporting my wife when (I think) she's being aggressive?", "selftext": "Recently my sister (Jane F33) and her fianc\u00e9 (Sally F29) came to have dinner with me (M35) and my wife (F35).\n\nWhile preparing dinner we got into an argument. Jane and Sally have said they do not want dogs at their wedding reception, which is a 2 day event (with family staying an extra day) about 2 hours away from where we live. That's fine but it makes things challenging for us because we have a large dog that's difficult to handle and we don't currently have anyone we can trust to leave him with.\n\nThe argument started because Jane felt hurt that we were not prioritising her wedding, we'd said we may not be able to attend the entire 3 days due to the no dog policy.\n\nDuring the argument my wife got angry. I will try to describe what I observed in the most neutral way possible. What I saw was that:\n\n* she raised her voice, well above the volume that everyone else was using\n* stood (when everyone else was sitting)\n* repeatedly and vigorously pointed at Sally to emphasise her words (continuing even after Sally said that the      pointing made her uncomfortable and to please stop)\n* spoke over other people\n* escalated the argument by interpreting what Jane and Sally were saying in the most negative way possible (for example saying that their attitude to accommodation at the wedding was an      example of them diminishing her status as a member of the family)\n\nThe result of this was that both Jane and Sally left in tears before we'd eaten.\n\nLater, my wife wanted to know why I had not supported her during the argument, by chipping in more to point out when Jane and Sally had been saying unreasonable things. \n\nI was also very angry and disappointed. I told my wife that it didn't seem like she needed any support, since she was arguing perfectly well for herself. I thought her behaviour was so aggressive that it doesn't really matter if she was right or wrong; however unreasonable people are being, you can't speak to them that way.\n\nShe says that I am unfairly judging her, that I am biased against her and that her behaviour was not aggressive.\n\nAITA for not supporting my wife?\n\nOther things that might be relevant:\n\n* Jane & Sally do not know that our dog is reactive to other dogs (which makes it difficult to leave him with others) - we've not told them because my wife thinks they will judge us for it\n* My wife believes that race forms a part of the disagreement, Sally, Jane and I are white, my wife is brown and she thinks that we are applying an angry black woman stereotype \n* My wife comes from an abusive background and is *extremely* sensitive to anything that feels like she's being excluded as a result of this trauma\n* This is not the only time my wife has been frustrated about me not backing her up in arguments. She is definitely a lot more comfortable with conflict than I am but I genuinely think in most cases that I didn't back her up because I actually didn't agree with her. She believes that it is my role to back her up regardless of whether I agree or not.", "created_utc": 1682951606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134o51q/aita_for_not_supporting_my_wife_when_i_think_shes/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You doing nothing in this scenario is not ok (they are *your* family and this is your conflict). You should have intervened and asked your wife to stop, and then calmly explained the situation better to your sister, be honest about your reactive dog and why you can't attend the full event.

If dogs were allowed, there would probably be other dogs too and your dog could end up disrupting the event. If you're staying overnight, I would think the obvious compromise would be to stay at a pet friendly hotel, leave the dog there during the event and take turns leaving the event to walk the dog. You're not an AH not backing up your wife on this, but you are for letting her escalate this when bringing the dog to the wedding was never an option", "YTA for letting it get to that point. Sometimes truly supporting your partner means letting them know when they're being unreasonable (before it escalates to the point that people start crying). At times you have to give them what they need, not what they want", "ESH and by everyone I mean you and your wife. You do not bring dogs to a wedding reception.

Why would someone ever think it's okay to bring their (nonservice) dog to a wedding? Unless the bride and groom specifically request or allow pets to attend, do not bring your animals. So your wife is not only in the wrong for screaming and flying off the handle, but was also clearly in the wrong on the underlying subject. You should not back up spouses and friends when they are so clearly wrong. That just leads to escalation and turns everything into a war between factions.", "NTA, your wife sounds unhinged\n\nWho even thinks that a dog might be welcome at a wedding? Especially your \"large, difficult to handle\" dog? Your dog is not your kid, it is a dog. Why would anyone, other than you two, prioritize your dog over literally anything else on earth? \n\nYou're allowed to think your dog is more important than your sister's wedding reception. Your sister is allowed to be hurt by that, and she's allowed to express herself. Maybe your dog and your wife both need behavioural lessons.", "YTA. I would've thought the default at a wedding is no dogs. Especially one that you admit is \"big and difficult to handle.\"\n\nAnd you are prioritizing your dog over your sisters wedding. If you absolutely can't find a kennel, why wouldn't you go on your own and your wife stay home with your dogs?", "NTA.\n\nIf your dog is tough to handle, it wouldn't have any business being at the wedding anyways.", "NTA Op. People can make any rules they want about their wedding.  And as a guest you can either swing it or not.  Standing up and aggressively berating people for it and making it personal makes your wife TA.  Sounds like she may need some pro help moving forward.  Because it\u2019s going to be a very long life of this.  The dog situation is tough and will hold you all back from many things.  But don\u2019t blame the people hosting the events you will miss.", "NTA -- Bringing a dog to a wedding / wedding reception is... uhhh... NOT reasonable, unless the hotel has dog sitting facilities...? \n\nYou may want to reassure your wife that you love her tremendously and are aware of her trauma, but maybe she could use a bit of therapy to address her past trauma, and that while it's your job to support your wife, sometimes that support is pointing out that she's in the wrong.", "YTA for not standing up for your sister and allowing your wife to mistreat her.", "You are an AH, but not for the reason you wrote in about. Your wife is also definitely an AH as well. \n\nAssuming you love and support your sister, you should be able to attend and fully participate in her wedding. Sure, there are lots of things that get in the way of that- price of travel, limited days off from work, child care, etc- and people should know their wedding isn't the end all be all of the universe. However, if I heard my sibling might not be able to attend my wedding in full because of their pet, I would also be hurt, because...come on. \n\nYour wife, from your own account, escalated a disagreement and you let your sister and fiance leave in tears. Your wife is right you should have stepped in, but to stop the argument, not to agree with her. \n\nNo, couples do not need to back each other up no matter what. You can disagree as gracefully as possible, but if my partner did the actions you describe, I would have stepped in right away and had them exit the conversation. Something like \"this is getting too heated, I would like to separate this now\" is a fine intervention that doesn't take sides and your wife would only feel like you weren't on her side because SHE is the one behaving badly. \n\nAnd standing up, pointing at people, and yelling over everyone could certainly be a cultural issue (different cultures and even families have different expectations around communicating), but it is not purely a race one. And we ALL have to adapt to the style of those we are communicating with- and that goes both ways. \n\nAnd when you think about this, it is about a dog. A dog that you don't have trained properly, that your wife won't let you tell people isn't trained properly, and a dog that sounds like a lot. So your sister is in tears, you may not go to her wedding, your wife is now mad at you and thinks your family is racist and you don't support her...and the center of that is a dog?\n\nI'm going with ESH, but I don't mean your sister and her fiance here.", "NTA: OP, It sounds like your wife blew right past assertive to aggressive & hostile. You sister & fiancee perceived the anger and not any logical message. \"Attack mode\" is not useful for anything other than expressing scorched earth anger. You did not share the anger, and cannot be expected to support that message.", "Info requested- When you say no matter how unreasonable people are you shouldn't yell, is that your stance on racism? \nHave they been racist to your wife and you've said this?\n\nIt's not unreasonable to not want dogs at the wedding. It is unreasonable to expect 3 days away from home from people with obligations like pets. \n\nI feel like there's some major info being left out here.", "You back her up in public and discuss it in private. You don't have to agree with her but you do have to stand by her. Especially if you both knew that the dog/ wedding situation would be discussed.\n\nYour wife is probably getting more defensive and \" aggressive\" because it's just her standing up for her dog. While it feels like you and your family are ganging up on her.\n\nDogsitter at the location? Dog hotels? \n\nESH.
