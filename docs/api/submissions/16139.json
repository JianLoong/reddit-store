{"id": 16139, "submission_id": "134o51q", "title": "AITA for not supporting my wife when (I think) she's being aggressive?", "selftext": "Recently my sister (Jane F33) and her fianc\u00e9 (Sally F29) came to have dinner with me (M35) and my wife (F35).\n\nWhile preparing dinner we got into an argument. Jane and Sally have said they do not want dogs at their wedding reception, which is a 2 day event (with family staying an extra day) about 2 hours away from where we live. That's fine but it makes things challenging for us because we have a large dog that's difficult to handle and we don't currently have anyone we can trust to leave him with.\n\nThe argument started because Jane felt hurt that we were not prioritising her wedding, we'd said we may not be able to attend the entire 3 days due to the no dog policy.\n\nDuring the argument my wife got angry. I will try to describe what I observed in the most neutral way possible. What I saw was that:\n\n* she raised her voice, well above the volume that everyone else was using\n* stood (when everyone else was sitting)\n* repeatedly and vigorously pointed at Sally to emphasise her words (continuing even after Sally said that the      pointing made her uncomfortable and to please stop)\n* spoke over other people\n* escalated the argument by interpreting what Jane and Sally were saying in the most negative way possible (for example saying that their attitude to accommodation at the wedding was an      example of them diminishing her status as a member of the family)\n\nThe result of this was that both Jane and Sally left in tears before we'd eaten.\n\nLater, my wife wanted to know why I had not supported her during the argument, by chipping in more to point out when Jane and Sally had been saying unreasonable things. \n\nI was also very angry and disappointed. I told my wife that it didn't seem like she needed any support, since she was arguing perfectly well for herself. I thought her behaviour was so aggressive that it doesn't really matter if she was right or wrong; however unreasonable people are being, you can't speak to them that way.\n\nShe says that I am unfairly judging her, that I am biased against her and that her behaviour was not aggressive.\n\nAITA for not supporting my wife?\n\nOther things that might be relevant:\n\n* Jane & Sally do not know that our dog is reactive to other dogs (which makes it difficult to leave him with others) - we've not told them because my wife thinks they will judge us for it\n* My wife believes that race forms a part of the disagreement, Sally, Jane and I are white, my wife is brown and she thinks that we are applying an angry black woman stereotype \n* My wife comes from an abusive background and is *extremely* sensitive to anything that feels like she's being excluded as a result of this trauma\n* This is not the only time my wife has been frustrated about me not backing her up in arguments. She is definitely a lot more comfortable with conflict than I am but I genuinely think in most cases that I didn't back her up because I actually didn't agree with her. She believes that it is my role to back her up regardless of whether I agree or not.", "created_utc": 1682951606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134o51q/aita_for_not_supporting_my_wife_when_i_think_shes/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If dogs were allowed, there would probably be other dogs too and your dog could end up disrupting the event.

You're not an AH not backing up your wife on this, but you are for letting her escalate this when bringing the dog to the wedding was never an option", "YTA for letting it get to that point.

NOT reasonable, unless the hotel has dog sitting facilities...? \n\nYou may want to reassure your wife that you love her tremendously and are aware of her trauma, but maybe she could use a bit of therapy to address her past trauma, and that while it's your job to support your wife, sometimes that support is pointing out that she's in the wrong.", "YTA for not standing up for your sister and allowing your wife to mistreat her.", "You are an AH, but not for the reason you wrote in about. Your wife is also definitely an AH as well. \n\nAssuming you love and support your sister, you should be able to attend and fully participate in her wedding. Sure, there are lots of things that get in the way of that- price of travel, limited days off from work, child care, etc- and people should know their wedding isn't the end all be all of the universe. However, if I heard my sibling might not be able to attend my wedding in full because of their pet, I would also be hurt, because...come on. \n\nYour wife, from your own account, escalated a disagreement and you let your sister and fiance leave in tears. Your wife is right you should have stepped in, but to stop the argument, not to agree with her. \n\nNo, couples do not need to back each other up no matter what. You can disagree as gracefully as possible, but if my partner did the actions you describe, I would have stepped in right away and had them exit the conversation. Something like \"this is getting too heated, I would like to separate this now\" is a fine intervention that doesn't take sides and your wife would only feel like you weren't on her side because SHE is the one behaving badly. \n\nAnd standing up, pointing at people, and yelling over everyone could certainly be a cultural issue (different cultures and even families have different expectations around communicating), but it is not purely a race one. And we ALL have to adapt to the style of those we are communicating with- and that goes both ways. \n\nAnd when you think about this, it is about a dog. A dog that you don't have trained properly, that your wife won't let you tell people isn't trained properly, and a dog that sounds like a lot. So your sister is in tears, you may not go to her wedding, your wife is now mad at you and thinks your family is racist and you don't support her...and the center of that is a dog?\n\nI'm going with ESH, but I don't mean your sister and her fiance here.", "NTA: OP, It sounds like your wife blew right past assertive to aggressive & hostile. You sister & fiancee perceived the anger and not any logical message. \"Attack mode\" is not useful for anything other than expressing scorched earth anger. You did not share the anger, and cannot be expected to support that message.", "Info requested- When you say no matter how unreasonable people are you shouldn't yell, is that your stance on racism? \nHave they been racist to your wife and you've said this?\n\nIt's not unreasonable to not want dogs at the wedding. It is unreasonable to expect 3 days away from home from people with obligations like pets. \n\nI feel like there's some major info being left out here.", "You back her up in public and discuss it in private. You don't have to agree with her but you do have to stand by her.

She isn't an angry black woman, but an aggressive woman who happens to be a poc.\n\nNTA", "You\u2019re not TA for not supporting your wife berating your sister and her fianc\u00e9e but YTA for just sitting there while it gets so bad that they leave in tears and also for thinking it\u2019s appropriate to bring a large untrained dog to someone\u2019s wedding in the first place", "NTA for not supporting your wife in any situation at all. \n\nIt sounds like your wife was the main aggressor and the idea \"your are meant to support her no matter what\" is only used by people who are being unreasonable and have no other excuse for why they should be supported. \n\nIf they'd been attacking your wife it would be different but it doesn't sound like it. It sounds like your wife needs to deal with the trauma of her abusive background rather than reacting and escalating conflicts in such a way.", "ESH\n\nYour sister is an asshole for starting an argument over you not being able to attend all 3 days of her wedding festivities because you want to follow her rules of no dogs.\n\nYour wife is an asshole because she screamed at your sister until she left in tears.\n\nAnd you are an asshole because you just let it happen.

Maybe you defending your wife would have helped tamp down her \"aggressiveness.\"", "Who the FUCK brings a dog to a wedding reception??? WHAT THE HELL. OF COURSE BOTH OF YOU ARE THE ASSHOLES. I'm including you because it doesn't matter that your dog is reactive, there are PLENTY of boarding houses and vets offices with boarding that you could send the dog to for TWO DAYS. My god. How entitled do you have to be to put your DOG ahead of the people having the wedding.", "ESH - Your wife does sound very aggressive. So she's an asshole for getting that in a huff about attending someone elses wedding. You're an asshole for never standing up to her, you're essentially content to let your wife make an absolute fool of herself and give your tacit agreement to her rantings during the event. And then you don't mention if you would have talked to her unless she had prompted you, did you say anything after she sent your sister home in tears? Newsflash buddy, that's a great way to look like a spineless purse husband. You're an enabler. You say nothing when the conflict occurs, and then sheepishly try to correct the party you disagree with after the fact. \n\nJane and Sally only get hit with it as a stray bullet, shouldn't have gone into a heavy discussion before dinner, that's a faux pas.

Enjoy that first, then fight. \n\nBoth you and your wife are AH's for being tied at the hip to your dog. Training, boarding, all of it is possible. You can't go somewhere for 3 days? You've created a serious anchor in your life and then the Mrs. gets mad when you see the repercussions of that. There is a pile of options to get you to that wedding for 3 days and if I was your sister I would be tremendously hurt at the lack of effort I'm seeing from you and your wife. That's my 2 cents.", "I don't see anywhere in the post that says he expects to be able to take his dog. He even says that the fact they've asked for the dog not to be there is fine.\n\nHe \"allowed\" his wife to get angry isn't really a fair argument. He doesn't control her and if she wants to get mad then that's her prerogative. The whole point of the post is because he didn't agree with the fact she got angry.\n\nOPs wife is the AH. I struggle to see how OP has done anything wrong here.", "I mean it sounds like OP wasn't trying to insist his dog go to the wedding. It sounds like he is very aware of the lifestyle limitations that come with having a dog and, as he was explaining them to his sister, she accused him of not prioritizing her enough.", "I\u2019m getting the picture that the dog bites or causes severe damage to a home. It being dog reactive is one thing, they can hire a sitter to stay at their home or keep it at their house as an only dog. Plenty of people do that.\n\nA muzzle and short walks for three days aren\u2019t the end of the world for the dog. You can even find a sitter with a backyard and request no walks off the property.\n\nTraining the dog to accept a muzzle and doing some sitter screening should be easy if given enough time - which, considering a whole wedding was planned, they probably had.", ">In what world is bringing a pet, let alone a large dog, even a THOUGHT?!?! \n\n10000% agree!\n\nIsn't it a given that weddings are pet free? It's just one of those universally accepted things.", "Also, why are these people afraid of boarding dogs? \n\nEvery place I\u2019ve ever boarded has \u201cupgraded suites\u201d where the dog is in its own room (not kennel) and they can\u2019t see or touch other dogs-you can usually pay for it to have its own play/walk time without other dogs as well. \n\nIt\u2019s like these people just give up without even bothering to look.", "A few weeks ago there was an AITA from a guy who brought a raccoon to a wedding\u2026", "I have seen the couple getting married involve their pets, but that isn't an open invitation for everyone else's pets", "> \"ESH- except your sister and her fianc\u00e9\"\n\nI'm not sure.

Bananas!", "There are definitely boarding options. And if it\u2019s only reactive to other dogs, plenty of pet sitting options.  Maybe the issue is just that there are no free options with friends.

That's the whole point of the post. Given how she is reacting now, I don't think him trying to address it in the moment would have helped at all.

Given her reaction now, I think him interjecting at the time would have just made things worse.\n\nHe could have said something at the time for sure but I don't think he is an AH for not doing so.
