Sheets are draped over gurneys when there are dead bodies on them, and I imagine with bottles etc all over the gurney, a sheet would make it look REALLY creepy for someone already dealing with intrusive thoughts and memories from hospital-related trauma.\n\nPersonally, I think a gurney is a really cool thing for a bar. I agree with your reasoning around it being easy to clean, and frankly I think the reminder of death is healthy for us all to have in our lives, lol.\n\nBut I was also raised to be generous in terms of the accommodations I offer invited guests, and have empathy and respect for people struggling with trauma and intrusive thoughts, so I don't really get your objection to rolling the gurney into another room. You don't say that would have made it inconvenient for people to top up (and let's be real, unless you live in a mansion it's never going to be inconvenient for people to simply step into a second room to refill their booze). You just suggest the brief action of rolling the rollable gurney is something you didn't want to bother with after the party started. Which I really don't follow.\n\nMaybe I just have a really chill and mutually respectful friend group, but it would have been so easy to just say, \"Oh, sure! Yeah, let's roll the bar behind this door here. Does that help? Awesome :)\" I just can't even imagine what dark (and unkind) sense of humour it would take to pretend to think that adding a sheet to this gurney-with-stuff-on-it would reduce someone's intrusive thoughts about dead bodies on gurneys. Or what total obliviousness to the context in which gurneys typically exist.\n\nThis isn't about a guest in your home being *entitled* to you moving your stuff that triggers their traumatic memories. But when it's easy for you to do, and doesn't conflict with your own deeply held values etc (e.g. they're not asking you to take down a religious icon, or remove a photo of someone on the basis of race; it's just a decorative/functional object, and one that you know is very odd in the context you've placed it: you bought it from a medical supply store and its designed purpose is to hold dead human bodies, you know this is a connotation everyone will have and that people may have a range of emotional responses to objects that remind them of dead human bodies), a kind person will typically just do it. Because the comfort of their guests is a higher priority than the brief inconvenience of rolling a rollable object to a near-but-less-visible location. And this gurney, while a 'cool' item, is by your own admission just a matter of aesthetics and convenience for you, not somehow core to your values. You *could* have moved it, and moved it easily (that's what gurneys are designed to do: be moved easily) but you chose to leave your guests in distress instead, and they decided to leave your party after realizing they were lower on your priority list than a gurney.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot a big thing, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA.

There\u2019s not a body under it. If there had been a sheet on it before she got there then she wouldn\u2019t have even known it was a gurney, so putting a sheet on it after wouldn\u2019t hurt anything. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about trauma, it was about attention and controlling a room. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like the decor in a bar, you just don\u2019t stay in that bar, you don\u2019t tell them to take stuff off the walls to accommodate you and you\u2019re paying them, they were at a party for free and had the audacity to pull this. \n\nDoes she have a meltdown when she goes into a hospital and sees gurneys everywhere?
