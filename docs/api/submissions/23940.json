Sheets are draped over gurneys when there are dead bodies on them, and I imagine with bottles etc all over the gurney, a sheet would make it look REALLY creepy for someone already dealing with intrusive thoughts and memories from hospital-related trauma.\n\nPersonally, I think a gurney is a really cool thing for a bar. I agree with your reasoning around it being easy to clean, and frankly I think the reminder of death is healthy for us all to have in our lives, lol.\n\nBut I was also raised to be generous in terms of the accommodations I offer invited guests, and have empathy and respect for people struggling with trauma and intrusive thoughts, so I don't really get your objection to rolling the gurney into another room. You don't say that would have made it inconvenient for people to top up (and let's be real, unless you live in a mansion it's never going to be inconvenient for people to simply step into a second room to refill their booze). You just suggest the brief action of rolling the rollable gurney is something you didn't want to bother with after the party started. Which I really don't follow.\n\nMaybe I just have a really chill and mutually respectful friend group, but it would have been so easy to just say, \"Oh, sure! Yeah, let's roll the bar behind this door here. Does that help? Awesome :)\" I just can't even imagine what dark (and unkind) sense of humour it would take to pretend to think that adding a sheet to this gurney-with-stuff-on-it would reduce someone's intrusive thoughts about dead bodies on gurneys. Or what total obliviousness to the context in which gurneys typically exist.\n\nThis isn't about a guest in your home being *entitled* to you moving your stuff that triggers their traumatic memories. But when it's easy for you to do, and doesn't conflict with your own deeply held values etc (e.g. they're not asking you to take down a religious icon, or remove a photo of someone on the basis of race; it's just a decorative/functional object, and one that you know is very odd in the context you've placed it: you bought it from a medical supply store and its designed purpose is to hold dead human bodies, you know this is a connotation everyone will have and that people may have a range of emotional responses to objects that remind them of dead human bodies), a kind person will typically just do it. Because the comfort of their guests is a higher priority than the brief inconvenience of rolling a rollable object to a near-but-less-visible location. And this gurney, while a 'cool' item, is by your own admission just a matter of aesthetics and convenience for you, not somehow core to your values. You *could* have moved it, and moved it easily (that's what gurneys are designed to do: be moved easily) but you chose to leave your guests in distress instead, and they decided to leave your party after realizing they were lower on your priority list than a gurney.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot a big thing, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA.

If there had been a sheet on it before she got there then she wouldn\u2019t have even known it was a gurney, so putting a sheet on it after wouldn\u2019t hurt anything. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about trauma, it was about attention and controlling a room. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like the decor in a bar, you just don\u2019t stay in that bar, you don\u2019t tell them to take stuff off the walls to accommodate you and you\u2019re paying them, they were at a party for free and had the audacity to pull this. \n\nDoes she have a meltdown when she goes into a hospital and sees gurneys everywhere?

You purchased something that will have horrible connotations for many people. Especially those who have lost people to car crashes or acts of sudden violence. It isn't something innocuous. It is something that is literally meant to transport dead bodies to a morgue and you know that. You don't have to care about people's past trauma and you don't have to move things around so they can be comfortable being in your home. But don't pretend it's weird to be surprised to see a cadaver gurney in someone's living room, and don't be so fast to brush off someone's trauma. You are allowed to own whatever is legally available to you, and to use it how you like. You are also insensitive, and you can own that too.\n\nNAH.", "Next time don't invite them. NTA", "Why is this a women thing?", "Did you miss the part where he was using the gurney as a bar? So there were objects on top of it (likely bottles of different heights). Throwing a sheet over that will look more like a sheet over a body than a sheet over a table.\n\nAlso, a gurney has wheels and is designed to be quickly moved while carrying a heavy load. It is in no way comparable to a bookshelf which obviously cannot be moved without huge inconvenience.\n\nI get that my comment goes against the grain here, since reddit seems to have group-think decided to vote all one way on this one, but I still think my point is valid so I'll leave it up and accept the downvotes.\n\n*Edit: I will say, upon further reflection I think it's unlikely that this overall story is true. Because I googled images of gurneys that someone could buy nowadays, and the usual types wouldn't be reliable for using for a bar, and the closest thing to what OP described basically looks like a rolling shelf-bar you could buy at IKEA, just made of metal but less useful because there are no railings to keep the bottles from falling off. If this thing had alcoholic beverages on it, I literally don't think it would occur to me that it was a gurney (so it wouldn't even look 'cool' for that), but I would think that using it reflects poorly on OP because of the lack of railings to keep bottles from just sliding off. Anything that rolls, you want guard rails on.*", "I didn't think it was the same girl.\n\n It was just hoping that nobody would be that nuts that somebody's last name being the same as a serial killers would set them off. \n\nXD  What a world we live in.

So they could still use it as a bar.", "Why would they unload every item from the gurney? That wouldn't make any sense in this context.\n\nThe plan that would have made his guests happy would have been to just leave everything on the gurney, but roll the gurney into the next room. That would've taken 15 seconds. I've been to lots of parties where the booze-refill room is one room over from where people are actually socializing, so it wouldn't have inconvenienced anyone else either, it would've been normal.\n\nOP implied that rolling the gurney was too onerous, so OP suggested the alternative of a sheet; the only way for this to be LESS onerous than the other option, would be to throw the sheet over everything. What you're now suggesting is that OP was offering to take every bottle off the bar one by one and put them on another surface, then place a sheet over the gurney, then move every bottle back to it one by one? But that would have taken comparatively ages, so I just don't get why he'd offer to do this more onerous thing when he wasn't willing to do the less onerous thing. \n\nI will grant you that if OP offered to do this, that was more than enough and he would be N.T.A. anymore, because a guest should really just get over it once there's a visually indistinguishable difference between a sheet-covered gurney and a sheet-covered table. But that wasn't how I initially interpreted OP's offer to guest, so I'm still leaving my initial comment at least until OP clears up what he offered to do.", "\u201cShe seems really upset.

Nothing more is needed from you.", "Years ago, I purchased an ambulance gurney at a prop sale and used it as an entrance table inside my house.  A few years later I worked on a game show (a version of the gong show) and we staged a skit where it was a race between two medical teams and gurneys.  The show already had one gurney, but needed a second.  I offered up mine, but after the sketch, they offered to trade my sleek, light gurney for an older hospital style steel gurney.  I took the trade, and I have had that gurney inside every house I\u2019ve lived in for 25 years.  It\u2019s been a entry table, a bar, and occasionally a prop for Halloween.  \n\nWhile I\u2019ve had people ask \u201cIs\u2026is that a\u2026a gurney?,\u201d I\u2019ve never had anyone react the way your friend\u2019s GF did.  I used to also have a wheelchair that we used as a cheap camera dolly, and I could understand if someone didn\u2019t want to sit there\u2026that\u2019s a little too close to home.\n\nI\u2019ve cleaned this thing to the extent that we literally eat from it.  (Okay, from plates atop it).  There\u2019s no doubt my gurney has seen some action, but my favorite feature is that someone scratched \u201cmaternity\u201d in the top.  While I suspect that not all of its passengers had a good day, I like the karma of providing a good home for a retired maternity ward gurney.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA.  Keep up the good work.", "Are you an idiot? Why would covering the bottles with a sheet be any easier for guests? They\u2019d have to lift the sheet every time they wanted a drink\n\n1. Take the bar stuff off the gurney. \n2. Put sheet over gurney\n3. Put bottles back on the gurney\n\nMaking everyone walk into a room that no one else was in to refill drinks when they could do it in the same room is absurd when people (who have two hands btw) can grab bottles off easily as a group effort, throw a sheet on and then redo the bar and not have to make the rest of the night more inconvenient."]}
