She leaves it outside when she\u2019s at work and it constantly barks at everything. The problem is that I work at nights so I sleep during the day. She moved in a few months ago and its constant barking has affected my sleep and work. I\u2019ve called the police but they can\u2019t do anything since it\u2019s during the day. I\u2019ve complained to her several times but she said dogs bark and basically blew me off.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago the barking woke me up again so I angrily got out of bed and went to the bathroom. On my way back, I noticed the barking was coming from the front of my house instead of the usual back. I looked out the window and there was her mutt in the middle of the street barking at a person in a car who was trying to lure it in. My first thought was that I should go out there and get the dog but then my second thought was that if this person took the dog, I\u2019d have my peace and quiet back. I watched for awhile until the person got the dog into the car and drove away. The next morning my neighbor approached me in tears asking me if I saw her dog and I replied no. I\u2019ve had great sleep since then.\n\nThe problem started yesterday when my girlfriend was over and we were preparing to go to bed. She said that we should stay at her place since she hates waking up early to the sound of my neighbor\u2019s dog. I told her we\u2019ll never have to worry about it again then told her the story when she asked why. She hates it as much as I do but was horrified when I didn\u2019t do anything about it getting stolen. We argued for a bit then she turned her back to me and went to sleep. She left before I woke up and sent a text saying that she expects me to tell my neighbor what happened and help identify the car through my ring app.\n\nI want my sleep and my job but I also don\u2019t want my girlfriend to hate me.", "created_utc": 1700347243, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yi5cb/aita_for_letting_my_neighbors_dog_get_stolen/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get the dog was a pain in the ass, but that\u2019s really cold to watch it get stolen and do nothing about it.", "NTA. You tried both the police AND talking to the neighbor to no avail. To be honest, if anyone is TA it\u2019s the neighbor. Wtf was she thinking leaving her \u201cdesigner\u201d dog outside all day? She was an irresponsible dog owner and hopefully the dog is with better owners.", "It is owners responsibility to take care and secure her own dog. Leaving an expensive dog outside all day, unsupervised is not responsible pet ownership. The dog was not having a good time because it was barking all day. Why does the OP have to potentially risk his life for a neighbour that has no consideration for others and is a poor pet parent. Sleep deprivation is no joke. If your GF ask, tell her you were is a state of fugue from the lack of sleep. The appropriate response would be,d have been to call the SPCA/animal control for neglect.", "I'm on you're side 100% because barking dogs keeping me up with uncooperative owners can 1000% fuck right off", "YTA for the utter lack of compassion or responsibility. You don't feel one ounce of empathy for your neighbor here. Your concerns are sleep and having your gf mad at you. The actual morality of it, the actual compassion of it, don't even enter the equation. \"Self serving\" doesn't begin to cover it.", "YTA because although you have no legal obligation to your neighbor, it's important to be kind to them. \n\nWhich is exactly what your neighbor just found out. Had she been kinder to you when you complained about the barking, you possibly would have intervened in the dog theft and would have at least assisted her making a police report of what you saw.\n\nMeanness to others make them mean to you. Now what sort of butterfly effect will your lack of kindness have on you, OP?", "ESH. Yes your neighbor should have treated the dog better, but you could have at least written down a license plate and called the cops.", "Eh, your neighbor hasn\u2019t been acting very neighborly, so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be inclined to potentially put myself at risk going up against some thieves for them. Some dog breeds are worth thousands of dollars (pomeranians in my area sell for $4000-$5000) and people have been killed for less. (Plus, as another poster said, they sound like a terrible owner and maybe it will have a better life now.) \n\nI would have told the truth, though. \u201cSorry neighbor, yes, I saw what happened but I didn\u2019t intervene because I\u2019m not getting my ass kicked/shot taking on random dognappers by myself. I don\u2019t even like you. You\u2019re a bad pet owner *and* neighbor, so you\u2019re on your own.\u201d\n\nNTA exactly, but a bit of a villain, lol. (I\u2019m not nice when I\u2019m sleep deprived either, so I understand.) You should come clean though and tell her why you didn\u2019t want to get involved. Isn\u2019t it funny how neighbors like that always expect YOU to be \u201cneighborly\u201d when they have an issue, yet they couldn\u2019t care less about your concerns! Maybe this will teach her that being neighborly is a two way street.", "NTA not ur responsibility. Also why was it loose? What if the ppl thought it was a stray. Where was the owner.", "Call me crazy but NTA. The dog was neglected by the neighbor and might be better off. Maybe not. The OP deserves to not have a dog yapping all day either. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t do any different although I wouldn\u2019t rat myself out to anyone.", "NTA. Not gonna risk getting shot for someone's annoying dog. If it were my annoying dog, sure, but not a neighbor who doesn't care.", "NTA. Where you messed up was telling the girlfriend. I doubt she will easily get past this. Hope the dog is happier now.", "YTA. That poor dog. You're heartless to feel no guilt over this, your sleep is not worth more than what your neighbour is going through, not to mention that poor dog.", "NTA\n\nEveryone whining about the loss of a pet are ignoring the fact that these people left this dog outside all day every day in a yard that clearly wasn't secure and in which it clearly wasn't happy.  They clearly didn't give a shit about it, so why should the OP when all it was to him was a source of misery?  \n\nIt's probably better for the dog that someone gave a shit enough to pick it up off the street.", "from a person who hates inconsiderate people with dogs, family and neighbors.. you need to learn to keep your mouth shut. could you have done something about it? maybe, maybe not. its not like you let the dog out. The dog isnt your responsibility. if people want pets they need to take care of them and teach them good manners. ta for relishing in it out loud cause you got crap fair and square. nts cause its not your responsibility. who leaves an expensive designer dog outside.", "Maybe I\u2019m a horrible person or just a person who has a neighbor with a dog that barks constantly until they bring it back in HOURS later but I\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nIf you had helped them lure the dog or hired them I\u2019d vote a different way but you didn\u2019t so enjoy your sleep. \n\nDog owner should have secured their yard better and been a better neighbor", "YTA. Agree it\u2019s incredibly inconsiderate of the neighbor to allow the dog to be barking all day, she probably hasn\u2019t trained it out of it\u2019s separation anxiety which is irresponsible.

AH.", "Wanted to say e s h, but it's a definite YTA.\n\nYeah, you lost sleep, but you legit witnessed a crime, lied about it to you neighbors face, then were happy about it afterwards. The truth could have least given her a lead, maybe make and model of car. \n\nFlip the story, say she saw someone break into your house and take something important to you, say you had a kid that got taken. Say that kid wasn't exactly liked by your neighbor. Say they go missing, you look around for leads, but instead of giving you one, she laughs at you and invites her friends over for a party to celebrate their new found peace at your expense.", "NTA. I completely understand why you chose to do nothing. However\u2026.some stories we take to the grave\u2026this was one.", "I'm going to say ESH. You for sitting back and letting a dog, something your neighbor clearly sees as family, be stolen right there and doing nothing to help.\n\nBut also the neighbor, because despite proclaiming to love her dog, she is absolutely neglectful of it. Leaving it outside all day and not caring about the noise concerns of her neighbors? Yeah, that's not the mark of a good pet parent.", "Nta and this is why: You were asleep, got woke up, sleepily went to the bathroom, and went back to bed.  Most people don't do their best reasoning at a time like this. It's hard to think things through and consider all the angles at a time like this, too.", "NTA she was neglecting her dog. Next time keep your mouth shut. These comments are crazy", "NAH. I get it. And actually you don't owe your neigbor thing. Its his responsibilities to make sure her/his dog safe and well", "NTA and congrats on the first good night's sleep you've had in weeks.", "NTA she didn\u2019t care that her barking dog ruined your sleep. She really sucks as a neighbor. Her dog barking is HER RESPONSIBILITY to stop when it bothers the neighbors. \nShe didn\u2019t take that responsibility & you owed her absolutely nothing. I too would have simply watched as the barking menace was taken. \nDon\u2019t tell her & don\u2019t help her catch the thief. If you do so & she gets the dog back it will again be ruining your sleep. \nIf your girlfriend doesn\u2019t get it, get a different girlfriend is my advice", "ESH. Neighbor obviously let the dog bark too much, but she also put it at risk by leaving it outside all day. The worst happened due to her lack of care.\n\nOP's choice to not intervene as the dog was being stolen is difficult to defend, although I understand lack of sleep probably played a part. And telling his GF was just dumb.", "NTA - Your neighbor told you to mind your own business so that's what you did.  Should not have told your girlfriend though.", "Clearly NTA. The neighbor does not have a pet but a toy. Hopefully the new owner is a real pet owner. Don\u2019t let people guilt trip you. You did nothing wrong.", "ESH. I probably wouldn't have helped as well when the crime was commited, who knows if the criminals had a weapon or anything. But I definitely would have let the neighbor know what I saw.", "They will probably bring it back if barks as much as you say. It's hard to vote against you because dogs that bark constantly are annoying af.", "Going statist the grain, but NTA, I hate all these dog lovers in the comment section, no one likes your dog and you suck at owning pets.", "NTA, \nNot your responsibility to keep track of the neighbors dog.\n\nAn owner that cares about their pets, don't leave them unattended all day in the yard.", "NTA - neighbor doesn't care about those around her, so those around her don't have to care about her or her dog.\nDogs probably happier anyway instead of being left alone all day.", "YTA\n\nSeriously? You have to ask? It's not the dog's fault that its owner is a pain in the ass. Give the video to your neighbor and buy earplugs.", "NTA \n\nLetting someone steal it is better than other alternatives to quiet a nuisance dog.  Besides, it\u2019s not your responsibility and the perpetrator could have been armed, you never know, it\u2019s not worth the risk.", "YTA. What in the Elaine Benes is this sociopathic shit?", "NTA the neighbor did not give a shit about you so you returned the favour. The dog will not be harmed as it has a value to the dognapper and will be sold, maybe the new owner will train it not to bark so much.\n\nKarma visited your neighbor.", "NTA-Neighbour shouldn\u2019t leave expensive designer dog outside.", "NTA. Your neighbor shouldn't have an animal in their care. It's only important to her as a status symbol. Otherwise, it wouldn't be outside all day while she's gone, and she would have trained it. \n\nYes, sometimes when dogs are nabbed, they end up in worse circumstances. A \"designer\" dog would be worth more to sell than to use for those worse circumstances. At least there's a reasonable chance it will end up with a decent owner.\n\nI doubt you were the only one being bothered. Another neighbor could have mentioned it to a friend. Things could have gone on from there.", "NTA for not intervening originally but YTA the asshole for bragging about it. Now you gotta deal with your girlfriend knowing what a selfish monster you are and if you want any chance of boning her again you're gonna have to eat shit in front of a neighbor who will hate you forever. Get better at keeping secrets.", "NTA. I\u2019d kill for good sleep so\u2026.watching a problem get solved is not so bad.

Sleep and quiet > girlfriend for me.\n\nI had a partner that had a constant shrieking pet and when it passed, my quality of life literally doubled. I felt bad I was gaining from their sadness but it was also one of the things that made me realize I couldn't stay in that relationship. They cared more about their animals than they did me. Maybe that's fine for others but not me. \n\nI also doubt they're luring an expensive dog to use it as a bait dog. Reselling it or just keeping it makes way more sense.", "YTA.

You could have been a bigger person but lol your neighbour should not expect kindness and consideration from a person shes been rude to. This is sad and hilarious at the same time.", "ESH in this situation.\n\nObviously, your neighbor sucks. She neglected her dog and allowed it to become a nuisance. Designer dogs are just mutts that backyard breeders sell for thousands of dollars, and idiots like your neighbor buy them as status symbols. She never spent time with the dog, never trained it, never took ot out for exercise. Of course the dog was going to bark its fool head off. Of course your neighbor blew you off.\n\nYou, my dude? You could've stopped the person who stole the dog, but you didn't. You could've been the bigger person and told your neighbor what you saw, but you didn't.

Sick and perverted people steal pets for sick and perverted uses.", "Scrolling it seems that I am the asshole. My immediate thought was how to hire a kidnapper for my neighbor's dog. I guess at least I won't have to write my own post. The gavel has dropped.", "Edit: Gonna get a lot of hate for this but hear me out. NTA.. As soon as I saw that she leaves him outside while she's at work and he constantly barks at everything, she had that coming. I can tell shes one of those owners that shouldn't have had a dog in the first place. But definitely try to track whoever stole it down. Her leaving them outside is honestly really fucked up. What if it gets too hot/cold?? What if it's hungry or needs some water?!? What if it got bit by a wild animal like a snake?? I could go on and on on how it's a really bad idea to leave your dog outside all day (let alone it being stolen) especially when you leave your house. Not only is it just inconsiderate but it's really just endangering the dog... Nevertheless, YOU NEED TO help identify the car and try to get them caught... Nobody likes a thief, and your neighbor sounds like a royal pain in the ass but she also doesn't deserve to have her dog stolen, and never to be seen again, even if she was pretty much asking for it.. And then maybe you helping your neighbor find who has her dog to get it back, you and her might be able to come to a even ground on her leaving her dog outside all the time, and chances are after this whole situation she won't again. Just knock on her door and tell her you found some ring footage a car (if you have any)... but I'm not gonna say you're an asshole for \"letting that happen.\"  For one, you can't control what happens to someone else's dog, let alone the dog itself, and also you have no clue who you might of been fucking with. You don't know who that is or if they're dangerous or not. Some theifs are aggressive and you could have gotten hurt by trying to go out there and intervene. Judging that she leaves her dog out there all the time and that it's drawing all kinds of attention, its very possible someone could have noticed that it's a rare dog and have planned to steal it. It's not your fault anything of that nature happened. And no matter what you could have done, it most likely wouldn't have changed the outcome of the dog being stolen. Yes you could have called the cops, but even then, they may not have been able to do much other than be on the lookout. So no OP NO THE AH! But at the very least, go try to see if you can't find anything that could help track down whoever stole her dog.", "YTA, but you make a valid point.\n\nIt's a really tough decision and it may seem heartless not to intervene while the dog is being taken away, but that's understandable given the constant discomfort the dog is causing.\n\nHowever, **your first mistake was not informing your neighbor about what was happening.**\n\n**The second big mistake is to share this with your girlfriend because it puts you in a negative situation.**\n\nIn this particular case, the constant disturbance caused by the neighbor's dog may justify your morally questionable action. **Still, it is wrong not to inform your neighbor and unwise to disclose this to your girlfriend.**", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say ESH\u2014 you\u2019re TA for letting a literal crime happen to an innocent animal, and your neighbor is TA for not training the dog better and leaving it outside all the time.", "YTA and absolutely horrible. If I was your gf I would dump your ass and tell the neighbour that their dog was stolen and that you were an accessory to the crime", "ESH. I hate my neighbor\u2019s barking dog too, but the devastation of losing a pet is not something I\u2019d actively abet. Your neighbor sounds like the worst.

It's not the dogs fault the owner is a pain in the ass. Dogs bark, get some earplugs. If it was a toddler keeping you up, I wouldn't be surprised if you pulled this if you saw a stranger kidnapping the child just so you can have peace and quiet to sleep.

She leaves it outside when she\u2019s at work and it constantly barks at everything. The problem is that I work at nights so I sleep during the day. She moved in a few months ago and its constant barking has affected my sleep and work. I\u2019ve called the police but they can\u2019t do anything since it\u2019s during the day. I\u2019ve complained to her several times but she said dogs bark and basically blew me off.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago the barking woke me up again so I angrily got out of bed and went to the bathroom. On my way back, I noticed the barking was coming from the front of my house instead of the usual back. I looked out the window and there was her mutt in the middle of the street barking at a person in a car who was trying to lure it in. My first thought was that I should go out there and get the dog but then my second thought was that if this person took the dog, I\u2019d have my peace and quiet back. I watched for awhile until the person got the dog into the car and drove away. The next morning my neighbor approached me in tears asking me if I saw her dog and I replied no. I\u2019ve had great sleep since then.\n\nThe problem started yesterday when my girlfriend was over and we were preparing to go to bed. She said that we should stay at her place since she hates waking up early to the sound of my neighbor\u2019s dog. I told her we\u2019ll never have to worry about it again then told her the story when she asked why. She hates it as much as I do but was horrified when I didn\u2019t do anything about it getting stolen. We argued for a bit then she turned her back to me and went to sleep. She left before I woke up and sent a text saying that she expects me to tell my neighbor what happened and help identify the car through my ring app.\n\nI want my sleep and my job but I also don\u2019t want my girlfriend to hate me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not speaking up gives the theif a sense of security to do worse.  What about the dogs safety, many get stolen for very harmful reasons?  There is so many reasons that not speaking up could cause more harm then just you being waken up, which can be solved by noise canceling eye masks that wrap around the ear. They make those you know, I use one myself for sleep aid. Either way what you did is really cruel. Tell your neighbors the truth.  \n\n\nBtw, you do know withholding the truth, if they went to police and the police questioned you, and you kept to your story...that's the same in MOST places as assisting the crime yea?

Leaving a dog unattended outside for hours upon hours at a time \u2014 especially when it\u2019s so clear that the dog hates it, like in this post \u2014 is dangerous for the dog & for passersby, & can get your dog taken away legally if you do it enough.

In a lot of places in the US it could be snowing or at least pouring very cold rain during the day. And again, this dog clearly was not bred or trained to be outside.
