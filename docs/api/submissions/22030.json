This is ridiculous. How can a perfect stranger enter your life as a nearly legal adult and start claiming parental rights? If he cared, he would have been present in your younger years. You and your siblings owe him nothing.", "NTA.\n\nYou are absolutely correct  \"he had multiple chances to be a parent but chose not, he doesn\u2018t get to be a parent when it\u2019s now convenient for him\". If his Family and friends keep harassing you, respond with that and block them. You had a great adoptive Mom & dad who really care about you and aren't just using you to pacify a childless wife. I suspect if bio dads wife has a kid, you'd get dropped like a bag of cold puke.", "NTA\n\nBio dad is delusional. Block him and his family everywhere, and if he continues to harass you, complaining to the police could be worth it.\n\nYou owe him absolutely nothing. He abandon you, and now wants you back as a consolation prize because he can't have children with his wife.", "NTA\n\nNever have contact with him again.  His behavior is off the rails, mean, and ridiculous.  Move on with no regrets.", "NTA.\nKind of seems like he got interested in being a dad when he experienced fertility issues and instead of respecting boundaries he is trying to destroy the only stable family unit you have known, so HE can feel better about things.\nIn all honesty, he has shown that he is manipulative and selfish - he only cares about himself.\nWhen someone shows you who they are- believe them.\nYour adopted parents sound incredible! Best of luck!", "Sounds like biodad is still the same self-serving jerk he was when you were babies. This is not about you guys. This is him trying to have the family he threw away, with no sense of remorse or humility for how his actions affected you. Trashing the people who came forward to give you all a stable, loving life. \n\nYou wondered who your dad was. Now you know. NTA", "NTA. Your bio dad did not consider what was the best for you or your siblings - he simply proposed what he wanted and then threw a tantrum when no one agreed to it. If he really cared about you kids he would have made his proposal, let you think it over, asked what you thought, and then lived with whatever you decided. Also, you are also old entries decide whom you live with. \n\nThe whole going to social media and getting family members to use peer pressure to force you to change your mind shows that he is not thinking of what is best for you, only what he wants and that he is not ready to be a parent.", "NTA\n\nThis post is light years beyond Reddit\u2019s pay grade. You and your twin need a therapist and seek professional help then get legal input while you\u2019re at it.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t be super stoked to be with a guy who disowned me for 16 years and now wants to jump back in because he has fertility issues with his wife.\n\nMy twin and I had a jacked up family too but that is resolved with time and professional support.", "NTA. What truly gets me is, first he begs you to be part of this family, and when you hesitate he flips the switch and becomes a total asshole. How does someone say, I love you, I want you to be in my life, then treat you like a pariah and rally other family members to attack. Berating your parents and threatening you and your sibling are not the actions of a caring parent. Is the actions of somebody who is focused on their interests alone, and being manipulative in order to get what they want. I wish you and your brother the best.", "NTA. If he was genuinely interested in your well being, he would be more interested in doing things the way you and your siblings are most comfortable. A comment like that still would have hurt but he would be able to recognize the validity of it and try to build a relationship in the way that\u2019s comfortable to you.", "NTA. Your bio dad is being wildly selfish here and you told it exactly how it is. He opted out of being your parent for most of your lives, he doesn't get to come in an act like the victim now that he's decided he wants to play dad. If he wanted to be an actual decent father he would actually show some sort of regard for your feelings and wellbeing, but it sounds like he doesn't even try to pretend he cares about anyone's feelings other than his own.", "What the hell? Who are these people! Stay far away!!!!!he made his bed long ago\u2026now sleep in it! NTA", "NTA. From his reaction and the reactions of his family and friends - the people he would be bringing into your life - you made the correct choice in cutting contact.\n\nHe abandoned you and is not even on your birth certificate. You've been adopted by the people you call mom and dad. He has no rights.", "NTA. \nHe decided he wasn't ready to have kids when you guys were born. He doesn't get to just show up out of the blue and be a parent now. He made the choice to not have a relationship with you. \nDo not apologize and block anyone who says you should. You have parents that love you; everyone else can go kick rocks.", "NTA, tell sperm donor, ' too little too late '. Maybe ask for back child support to get them off your back?", "This has to be fake. There are so many layers of protection in place with both adoption agencies and CPS that this has to be fake.", "[removed]", "YTA seems as if you\u2019re still holding a grudge against your father for not being around when you were around \n\nHe was a teen himself, I\u2019m assuming somewhere around your age, do you feel ready to parent ? If not how would you feel if you\u2019re child held it against you your whole laugh \n\nShould he be talking about your adoptive parents prolly not but he wants to spend time and get to know you guys \n\nHe\u2019s willing to have you around during all his free time he clearly loves and cares about you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The bio dad seems to be an egocentric AH, lucky you did not have such influence during childhood. You may want to thank him for that (this would be so passive aggressive) ... Apparently he is not even on the birth certificate... If he goes toward the struggle of paternity recognition to have some legal rights, he will be either late or in the perfect timing to pay for your university tuition... \nThe fact that he uses social media defamation and his family/friends to persuade you to get into some kind of informal custody could be a good start to get a restraining order toward him and the others... And possibly damages.\n\nEasier said than done and you are not here to protect anybody except yourself and your sibling... But just to say... turning a situation into a serious legal sh*t has a tremendous effect on obnoxious entitled AH like your bio dad.", "YANTA. Kids always have a right to their parents, parents don\u2019t always have a right to their offspring.\n\nSince your bio dad is acting like a complete asshole, you are in your rights to disown him.

If they did have children, they never would have contacted you. \n\nNo formal agreement? Yeah, right. If they don't like you or you don't behave how they want, then they have no legal responsibility to you, and they will ghost you.\n\nIt's like 1-800-Rent-a-kid.", "NTA op but answer on social media :\n\n1. that he didn't want to have anything to do with your bio mother's pregnancy, \n\n2.he wasn't there for you 15+ years, \n\n3. he lost his legal rights to you and did NOTHING for 15+ years to fix this\n\n and 4.  only come back to try and screw up your life and family when he and his wife couldn't get pregnant \n\n5. He is insulting your parents that actually cared and loved you for years every time he met you and despite warning him to stop he continues leading to you refusing to meet \n\n\nSee how fast those calls stop.

While not being ready to have kids is a valid reason to put a child up for adoption, sounds like he used it to abandon bio-mom and forget he had equal responsibility. He's not sorry he wasn't there for his children and he is not really interested in them now, he is romanticising being a dad.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. My daughter's dad actually told me that he looked forward to meeting her when she's an adult. You know, past the diaper stage. After the first broken heart or two. Beyond the teenage angst. When there's no parenting left to do. I laughed and assured him she won't have any holes in her heart that only he can fill. She's 12 and doesn't see why she would ever need to meet him. She says he hasn't been there, so he doesn't get to be in the future. If she can see that at 12, you can certainly see that at 16.
