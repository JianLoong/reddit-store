NTA.", "What are you supposed to be grateful for? Him looking away while your bio mom and her husband lost custody of you? His wife's inability to have kids making him have no other choice but to turn to you?\n\nNTA. Don't engage with that man, he might be your sperm donor but he's NOT your dad.", "Ungrateful for what exactly? He abandoned you for 16 & 18 years. You don't have anything to be grateful for.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Go no contact with bio dad.", "NTA.  His behavior now makes me wonder how terrible a parent he would have been.  It sounds like a good thing that he can\u2019t have any kids.", "NTA you and your parents are 100% correct. Stay away from this man.", "A whole firing squad of bullets dodged OP!\n\nYou sound like you've grown up fine without him ( and his minions)", "I'd be replying to his friends asking what OP should be grateful for?

What a dick. Sorry your bio dad sucks.", "Exactly. Bio dad is coming back to OP and her siblings' life only because his wife can't have kids. He doesn't give a rat's ass about these kids. The moment his wife gets pregnant, he'll drop them off. The farther OP stays away from him, the better for her.", "That\u2019s my first idea as well; \u201cGreat daddy!

Let\u2019s start with 16-18 years of back pay for child support, and then we\u2019ll talk!

Ewwww", "1. Stop calling the sperm donor a dad. He's not a dad. He DECIDED HIMSELF to not be a dad. That's his fault. 100000000% on him.

He has not  reached out with love, regret and compassion, he has done so with intimidating & self serving behaviour. \n\nYou have your real Mum and Dad, they were there for you every single day and brought you up with empathy,  love and kindness. No one is poisoning your mind, you can see who he is clearly by his own behaviour  and you can  make your own minds up. \n\nYou owe him nothing and attempting to bully you and your parents on social media is disgusting.", "sounds like he used it to abandon bio-mom and forget he had equal responsibility.", "NTA\nThis post is light years beyond Reddit\u2019s pay grade.", "You and your twin need a therapist and seek professional help then get legal input while you\u2019re at it.", "Bad bot", "Arguing with yourself there.
