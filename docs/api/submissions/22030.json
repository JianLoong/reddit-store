Ask him where is the child support for the last 18/16 yrs, for 3 kids. Because until he pays, he is nothing. As for those ppl that keep calling, ask them where they've been all your life & why now they suddenly think they know you, the situation or whats best for you.

At 16/18 years old, you should have a pretty large influence on that decision.", "NTA. It might help to use the term \"sperm donor\" rather than \"bio dad,\" because from the very start he's been quite deliberate about not being your dad.\n\nWho are the \"family\" who are on his side? Are they fully aware of why you were placed for adoption in the first place? Are they aware that if your sperm donor had done his duty right from the start, this wouldn't have been an issue?\n\nOne of the hardest lessons to learn in life is that while anyone can find redemption, the harm one does can not always be reversed. In this case, the harm he did at your birth by not claiming paternity has led to a permanent relinquishment of the right to have you call him Dad. If you want to grant him that privilege, that's fine, but if you don't, that's perfectly fine too.

Me and him had a rocky relationship since I was 15 (I\u2019m 26 now) and he was in and out of my life for years and my mom\u2019s brothers had to pick up his father duties for me and my brother. My uncle\u2019s stepped up as dad because it was their jobs to be there for their niece and nephew as well as their own kids. My father has trash talked two of my uncles and I see it out as jealously because they have shown what real dad\u2019s are.

IANAL, but they may actually have a valid financial claim to dad from birth up until the time they were adopted. At that time, they were no longer legally his responsibility.

This is a selfish motive by him and it\u2019s evident by the way he handled the rejection.
