In the past few decades, though, Mormons have been moving away from the whole coffee, and tea is bad and leaning more towards it's between you and God whether you want to drink them or not.\n\nNo one really knows why such rule was put in place. The Mormons say divine inspiration, but exmos speculate that Joseph Smith was embarrassing after his first legal wife, Emma Smith, chewed him out in front of his religious coworkers for smoking and spitting tobacco all over the house she had to clean.

I was homeless, because of your church.\n\nYour church teaches these things about Coffee, well, not coffee for anyone who actually reads and pays attention, it mentions hot drinks in general in the \"Word of Wisdom\", not coffee. However, your church shames people for doing these things, yet you sit here saying you are a fully active LDS member, probably with a temple recommend, and you are going against the word of wisdom?\n\nHonestly, why are you even Mormon, it is like, you like the idea of it and they tell you that you are better than women and will ascend higher than them, I guess maybe that is it?\n\nSorry, your religion is highly abusive and sucks, so do you for following and financially supporting them with your 10%.", "I think the idea that you need to love everyone regardless of their history isn't a very good lesson to teach. Yes, Jesus loved everyone, but he also had the strength to protect himself when needed. To little kids, love is what you feel towards your parents, and it also comes with the knowledge that this love will protect you from harm. If you teach a kid to love everyone, then they'll be in for a hard lesson when they learn that many people don't love them back.\n\nThis is a lesson I've had to unlearn as it created an issue with people pleasing and constant feeling like I needed to put my own wants and needs aside to keep that love going. A better lesson would be to protect the ones you love, but love yourself the most.

I remember reading somewhere that in the 1800s this whole \"Is coffee/tea great or terrible for you\" discourse was a huge part of public conversation. You had doctors and faith leaders and politicians staking out really intense positions about what people should eat and drink for their health, because we didn't actually know that much scientifically about what a healthy diet was and the growing international economy and influx of immigration meant people in the US were encountering new and exciting foods and drinks all the time with no idea of how to fit them into their worldview.
