They knew you don't eat it. You informed them you don't eat it, why are they trying so hard to have you eat it, you offered to go back to the hotel and let them enjoy themselves, she refused and that's on her. \n\nYour religion and beliefs and more important than what they think, their intake was extremely poor and disrespectful. If they don't share your beliefs at least have the decency to respect them and the person.", "Wow... NTA. You have every right to choose what you eat based on your religious beliefs and dietary restrictions. It is unfair for your mother and the guy she likes to pressure you into eating something that goes against your beliefs, especially during Ramadan.  \nIt is also disappointing that the restaurant only had pork dishes and did not offer any alternative options. The guy's insistence on trying the pork dish and his lack of respect for your beliefs was not acceptable. Frankly, his behaviour is disgusting and ignorant.  \nFurthermore, your request to have your food served at 8 pm, during the time when you could break your fast, was not unreasonable, and it is unfair for your mother and her date to be annoyed by it. Honestly, I'm not sure why they dragged you along in the first place.  \nYour mother's reaction was also unjustified, and it is not right for her to blame you for ruining the evening, when it was her date's Islamophobic behaviour that ruined the evening. It is important for her to understand and respect the dietary restrictions associated with your beliefs, especially during Ramadan. That's what familial love and respect looks like. Any chance you could go low contact with this side of the family? They sound awful. I'm so sorry.", "INFO: how do you know that the guy knows that you don't eat pork? Does he know it's for religious reasons? \n\nIt seems like there were bunch of little things that built up but really the issue is that your mom's boyfriend (or whatever) wanted you to try the pork plate when you felt like you had done enough already. His suggestion is honestly fine if you just don't like pork (you should try the pork here, it's better/ different. Slightly dumb but within normal human interaction), but if he knows you don't eat pork for religious reasons, then it's an asshole move.\n\nEdit: to be clear, just telling him you're Muslim is not enough to mean no pork. Different people of the same faith keep different levels of dietary restrictions.", "NTA\n\nThey showed multiple signs of disrespect towards you.

You should have made yourself scarce, not gone to dinner with them. When one person observes religious rules and another does not, it is bound to create rifts, when they do not respect each other, which you and your mother don't. Mind you, the fact that you observe the rules does not in my book make you the better person.

Pushing jewish and muslim people to eat pork is banal bad manners.

I hope the rest of your Ramadan goes well.", "You're NTA. Your mother and her friend were behaving horribly. Telling you eat pork was disrespectful and indefensible. Complaining that they had to wait 20 extra minutes to eat was childish. Blaming you for ruining their night was laughable and ridiculous.", "NTA, Ramadan Mubarak", "NTA\nYour Mom is tho", "Yeah, I thought that as well.  Trying to impress him since he's a German/US guy and showing herself from the best side.", "I rarely ate iftar at home.  Since I got invited to my uncle's place or my grandmother's place. And she was proud. I work from 6 am-5 pm with 1h break at lunch, and whenever I get home, I directly fall asleep until iftar. She knows that I'm extremely exhausted and tries to support me as much as possible. \nBut the way I saw her yesterday shocked me. \nI am the only one who fasts from the family (brothers and mom). But until now, I was never disrespected for doing so.", "It's the second dinner. \nYesterday, we got invited to his mom's house, and she did lasagna. I asked her if she could do it with beef, and she understood.  We had a pretty interesting conversation about the way I fast and how she does.

OP explained in the post that boundaries were set multiple times and mom already knew all  of it.

Yet doesn't care, their is only one thing she wants and again it is the guy.\n\nI also hate to say it as well. I bet you she would willingly throw you away and a relationship away with you just again to get with the guy.", "So the dude might just be socially inept? I don't see how you knew that he knew that you never eat pork. I'm also not sure how much he was part of that conversation.", "[deleted]", "Those fries might have been cooked with lard though. Did you ask what fat/oil they use in their kitchen?", "While my mom was talking to him on the phone once, I heard how they wanted to reserve a place at the restaurant. I walked by and told my mom that she should check that there's something without pork in the menu. And they talked about it for a while. \nThey didn't find a restaurant that evening, but the information was given. \nThen, when he told me to try the dish, I asked him if he did that on purpose.

What everyone is trying to say is that even though she knows and understands that.

She 100% does understand and knows and yet again doesn't care.\n\nIt is all about the guy and getting laid, simple really.", "Mhm\nIt's plant based frying oil.\n(The fries are considered as vegan in the menu list)", "So... you never told him yourself until after he suggested the pig hunter plate. I think that could be part of the problem.\n\nTelling your mom is not the same thing as telling him and you should know that. \n\nI'd say somewhere between NAH/ESH with your mom leading the asshole pack. \n\nMom's boyfriend should have picked up on the context clues and not made a tone deaf suggestion. \n\nYou got hungry- angry and snapped. Understandable, but not good behavior, and I'd imagine part of your fast is dealing with your hunger and you kind of failed there. You also had the salad option. While it would have been nice to choose a restaurant that better catered to your needs, they weren't expecting you to starve and I'm not sure why they couldn't start eating at 7:40 and then you could have gotten your food at 8, but maybe that was a restaurant issue. \n\nYour mom should have communicated your dietary restrictions more clearly and advocated for you when they went to the all pork restaurant. Alternatively she should have respected your decision to turn in sheet you were hungry and tired.", "yet she does understand and she doesn't respect her own son, it is quite obvious to me.\n\nThe only thing she wants is the guy and to get laid, really simple.\n\nShe will throw her son and a relationship with him away like he is nothing. All just to get laid, I have seen women like her over the years. Women who throw everything away for a guy.", "That\u2019s a relief. :)", "Well, for me, it seemed clear because I never talked to him until yesterday, and my mom told him about not eating pork and that I fast. \n\nI was pretty mad there,  yeah.", "You sound like you're an adult. It's your responsibility to communicate your dietary needs. \n\nYou never talked to him before and you thought he knew your dietary restrictions... that's kind of a poor take imho.", "She watched her mother tell him? He was absolutely aware of her dietary needs. She had never met this man, and made sure her needs were communicated in a way that made sense. He knew and didn't care.", "She (?) didn't specify that mom told him that she doesn't eat pork for religious reasons. I do agree that he should have put two and two together, but \"I don't eat pork for religious reasons\" is different than \"I don't eat pork (because I don't like it)\" Especially in Europe, it's more common to not observe religious dietary restrictions.", "Does it matter why? If I don't eat something, it doesn't really matter why I don't. I don't take my friends who don't like seafood to a sushi restaurant and then accuse them of ruining the evening when they don't eat. It's still rude as hell"]}
