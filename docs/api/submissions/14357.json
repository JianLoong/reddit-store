The guy's insistence on trying the pork dish and his lack of respect for your beliefs was not acceptable. Frankly, his behaviour is disgusting and ignorant.  \nFurthermore, your request to have your food served at 8 pm, during the time when you could break your fast, was not unreasonable, and it is unfair for your mother and her date to be annoyed by it. Honestly, I'm not sure why they dragged you along in the first place.  \nYour mother's reaction was also unjustified, and it is not right for her to blame you for ruining the evening, when it was her date's Islamophobic behaviour that ruined the evening.

Slightly dumb but within normal human interaction), but if he knows you don't eat pork for religious reasons, then it's an asshole move.\n\nEdit: to be clear, just telling him you're Muslim is not enough to mean no pork.
