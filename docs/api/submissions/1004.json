I\u2019m going to go with NTA, although some people make a good point; did coach know because Bobby was lamenting at practice after, perhaps, the friend he was texting gave him shit, or did coach know because coach was the one your son was texting?

They make mistakes.\"\n\n>On the way home Bobby was telling me about all the fun he had in practice, and I started to feel guilty.\n\nI'm gonna say NAH. Your son's coach is someone he trusts, and Bobby likely talked to his coach cause he was still feeling sad/bad about the situation. He may have even shared other times when he's been in trouble. Coach cares enough to try to bring it up to you, there's no assholes there. You, understandably, had a knee jerk reaction in the heat of the moment. As long as you don't leave it as is (meaning listen to your guilty gur and go talk to Coach) then you won't be an asshole either, just human.\n\nWithout knowing your family dynamic or punishment style, I want to point out what I think the coach took away from his convo with Bobby:\n\n>\"It's okay to give kids grace. They make mistakes.\"\n\nI think what he took from the convo was that Bobby feels he was punished for no reason other than not being tired, which was out of his control. \n\nMaybe Bobby often feels he's punished for reasons out of his control. Or that he's not given the chance to explain himself before a punishment. Bobby could be feeling any number of things, honestly. Regardless, I think Coach was just trying to convey that Bobby's not feeling heard without flat out saying \"Bobby came to me sad/frustrated/angry because of [insert event here]\". And that he was trying to give you a heads up that your kid is hurting a lot more than he lets on. \n\nAnd you should go to Coach and have a genuine talk. You're feeling guilty, so you know in your gut that Coach likely was trying to come from a good place. It would be nice to acknowledge that. And, if you're interested, it would open the door to asking him what prompted this in the first place. If you do so, remember that you may learn things that Bobby wasn't comfortable sharing with you and that can lead to a whole slew of emotjons. So please try to keep his comments in mind \"Its okay to give kids grace.\"", "YTA, when teachers and coaches come to you with concerns about your child getting immediately defensive kind of confirms those concerns. \n\nIt's like instead of hearing anything that was actually said, you chose to feel insulted and not listen at all.", "So you believe that nobody who was in the room when Bobby was conceived should get a say of how he is raised.

It was probably an awkward conversation for the coach to start with you, especially since you never know if some people are going to blow up.

It\u2019s not that puberty is making him want to break curfew, but maybe his curfew time doesn\u2019t make sense for his sleep cycle right now and he doesn\u2019t want to just lay there staring at the ceiling restless. \n\nYour son needs you to guide him through this time of change. He\u2019s experiencing changes and you just punished him for it with chores.

This coach has likely seen this with many kids. Maybe you should ask for some time to sit and talk with the coach to find out a bit more about how your son is interpreting your actions and make sure your son is feeling supported and understood while you are enforcing your rules and boundaries. It\u2019s time to start teaching him things about why you set rules, like how staring at a phone screen before bed can make falling asleep even harder and that\u2019s why you set limits. \n\nMost importantly, listen to your child.
