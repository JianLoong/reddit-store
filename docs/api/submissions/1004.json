Your son's coach is someone he trusts, and Bobby likely talked to his coach cause he was still feeling sad/bad about the situation. He may have even shared other times when he's been in trouble. Coach cares enough to try to bring it up to you, there's no assholes there. You, understandably, had a knee jerk reaction in the heat of the moment. As long as you don't leave it as is (meaning listen to your guilty gur and go talk to Coach) then you won't be an asshole either, just human.\n\nWithout knowing your family dynamic or punishment style, I want to point out what I think the coach took away from his convo with Bobby:\n\n>\"It's okay to give kids grace. They make mistakes.\"\n\nI think what he took from the convo was that Bobby feels he was punished for no reason other than not being tired, which was out of his control. \n\nMaybe Bobby often feels he's punished for reasons out of his control. Or that he's not given the chance to explain himself before a punishment. Bobby could be feeling any number of things, honestly. Regardless, I think Coach was just trying to convey that Bobby's not feeling heard without flat out saying \"Bobby came to me sad/frustrated/angry because of [insert event here]\". And that he was trying to give you a heads up that your kid is hurting a lot more than he lets on. \n\nAnd you should go to Coach and have a genuine talk. You're feeling guilty, so you know in your gut that Coach likely was trying to come from a good place. It would be nice to acknowledge that. And, if you're interested, it would open the door to asking him what prompted this in the first place.

It\u2019s not that puberty is making him want to break curfew, but maybe his curfew time doesn\u2019t make sense for his sleep cycle right now and he doesn\u2019t want to just lay there staring at the ceiling restless. \n\nYour son needs you to guide him through this time of change. He\u2019s experiencing changes and you just punished him for it with chores.

This coach has likely seen this with many kids. Maybe you should ask for some time to sit and talk with the coach to find out a bit more about how your son is interpreting your actions and make sure your son is feeling supported and understood while you are enforcing your rules and boundaries. It\u2019s time to start teaching him things about why you set rules, like how staring at a phone screen before bed can make falling asleep even harder and that\u2019s why you set limits. \n\nMost importantly, listen to your child.

My method must work.\" Which I see a lot in my fellow non parents. Yes they are respectful BECAUSE you aren't the one parenting. \n\nHe sees the missing Dad as an opening for him to assume the role and get to play pretend parent. You were respectful and set a line between parent and teacher.", "Nta. I thought you handled his punishment beautifully . Your son would complain about me to the coach all the time if I was his mom. Lol. All of my kids devices get charged in my room at night so I know they aren't on them all night. If they aren't sleepy and want to stay up they can read.", "The coach was WAY out of line in this instance. Instead of gowing to bed the kid was texting doing other stuff on the phone so of course he couldn't sleep, I as adult often go to bed too late bcs I waste too much time on my phone. The kid only had to mop the kitchen WITH OP as punishment. I see no reason for the coach to but in.", "Right?!\n\nI'm really shocked that anyone, anywhere thinks \"Oh, you're not tired enough to go to bed? Well then let me introduce you to helping Mum with her chores.\" is any sort of punishment. Legit the opposite of strict. \n\nPlus: ***\"I told him that I appreciated his concern for Bobby, but that it'd be best if he kept his advice sports related, because he isn't a member of our family and it's not really his place to weigh in on my parenting choices.\"*** is a SUPER polite response. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit you're drunk today.", "Perfectly reasonable parenting, and this coach is overstepping. NTA", "Yes when a parent chooses chores as a punishment instead of figuring out why their kid can\u2019t sleep of course the kid is going to lay in bed and pretend to sleep. I had parents like you. I don\u2019t talk to them anymore.", "Sorry but YTA, when teachers and coaches come to you with concerns about your child getting immediately defensive kind of confirms those concerns. Be glad your child has someone to talk to, thank the coach for caring and supporting your son and move on.", "What an insane leap to make...", "Predators don't encourage parents to listen more to the kids they prey on. That's the opposite of what they'd want. The only thing that feels off is that you'd go there based on nothing.", "Reddit gonna Reddit", "You do know lying in bed and pretending to sleep is a great way to fall asleep, right?", "The kind where you don't equate a kid complaining about mopping the floor to some desperate attempt to \"get help\".", "While I hope it isn't true, this happens dozens of times in every US state each year. Outside of direct family members, coaches and extracurricular supervisors are the second most likely person in a child's life to commit sexual assault and grooming.\n\nYou may not like that fact, surely I hate that this is the world we live in, but it's worth the minute to check.", "I don't think anyone is sure this is happening. They are just saying to double check.", "A better thing imo is deciding something he is allowed to do when he can\u2019t sleep. Reading, tidying his room, quiet hobbies, light exercise. The punishment was weird but the coach was way out of line with saying OP should just let him break the rules. If he felt the need to say something, like you said, it should\u2019ve been about \u201cx told me he\u2019s been having trouble sleeping. Lots of boys have trouble with it through puberty, maybe you could set up a list of things he can do to tire himself out instead of using his phone so it\u2019s easier to keep to the schedule.\u201d\n\nI get he cares but what response did he expect? Do parents often thank him for expressing that he disagrees with how they\u2019re parenting their child? I feel like the answer must be no", "NAH.\n\nAs a teacher once told me, \"filling the local space with mouth sounds is not talking and talking is not a conversation.\"  Clearly Bobby felt comfortable talking to his coach and, assuming US, the coach is a mandatory reporter - unless his name is Rep. Gym Jordan (R -OH).\n\nHearing an outside perspective can be enlightening unless you prefer to close your mind and sit in the dark.", "Teenagers naturally change their sleep schedules during puberty, they will tend to stay up later and wake up later as teenagers", "Ahh, good old Reddit.", "I\u2019m sorry no. I graduated in 2016\u2026 I NEVER had a teacher\u2019s number. My PARENTS had my drama teachers number (shout out to Ms. Wall-e) because I would stay late during play rehearsal, but I don\u2019t think any of us had her number. That\u2019s a good way for lines to be crossed. Highly fucking inappropriate", "Dozens of times, in other words highly unlikely.", "I agree that kids who are on their phone 24/7 is a problem\n\n\nI was writing to disagree with the statement you made that 13 year olds should be able to manage their own sleep schedules, and using my personal experience to justify why.  Some 13 year olds may be mature enough for this and other decisions.  Other 13 year olds are not.  Managing sleep decisions should be based on individual maturity,  not reaching an arbitrary age.", "Telling a kid to be off their phone by a certain time is not overly strict. Research is showing more and more that staring at a screen before sleeping is incredibly detrimental to sleep habits. Teenagers need a lot of sleep, and 10:30 is pretty late for a school night for a middle schooler. Setting boundaries is important for kids. And it sounds like OP then was talking to him while he helped mop the kitchen. \n\nYes, it's important for kids to feel comfortable talking to their parents, but that doesn't mean you don't set boundaries for them. And having a child do a household task when they insist they aren't tired isn't a super aggressive punishment. It's a fairly natural consequence. You're not tired at bedtime? OK, let's do something physical but not overly taxing that doesn't involve a screen.", "Well you\u2019re not best friends parent, and what they do at they house doesn\u2019t effect yours.", "Look this is almost certainly not the case, Reddit just tends to go to the darkest possible places. Worth checking though, but nothing to be actually concerned about until there is any actual hint that that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.", "Yeah it was always homework related or at least school related to some degree (fundraisers, school trips, etc). My parents and I ~~I\u2019m able to watch my sister in a way my parents can\u2019t~~ were both keeping an eye on the situation because it was new to us too and it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Ultimately nothing nefarious came from it tho that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying this\n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t check the messages or to automatically dismiss this as being unprofessional encounter (texting your son not confronting you). I\u2019m saying the school culture and atmosphere sphere is changing and you should always keep an eye on the relationship your kid has with other adults.", "Dozens of times in every state is hundreds of times nationally. Not that unlikely, especially considering that a) most people who do such things have multiple victims and are often only caught out for one/a couple, and b) those are only the ones who get caught.", "Oh, no, I understood what you were saying. But if the reason you don't think they're fit to start to learn how to manage their sleeps schedule is because they can't handle having phones, then it's the phone situation that needs to be addressed. \n\nI never said 13 was *the* year when this had to be done. I'm saying that around this time the consequences for them failing to adjust to their new freedom is going to be less significant than if you wait until their grades really start to matter. They will stay up too late several times before they get the hang of things, that's inevitable so it's best to plan accordingly.", "It's wild that you'd jump to the idea that it was the coach texting him because the coach gently urged his parent to be more of a friend than a disciplinarian as the kid's in a difficult time in his life. A predator wouldn't encourage a kid they're grooming to get closer to and confide more to their parent. They'd do the opposite. I get that some people cannot deal with having anyone else try to help them with their kids, but to accuse people of being a predator for that is... something.", "and it could be something totally innocent. maybe the kid was texting a his age friend because something was going on that he didn't feel comfortable telling his parents about.\n\nOP, you made a rule. it's reasonable to enforce it. but it's also okay to say to your kid- you know that it's past phone curfew time. if you need to text your friend right now because it's so important, i'll okay it if it's important but you need to show/explain what it's important. (but it's also okay to say is phone curfew and that means phones get turned off. and that you take the phone so he isn't tempted by it.)", "Hell I was an adult when I learned one of the teachers at my old high school was discovered having relations with students and that it had been happening while I was at school. So yeah. Happens more than people know.", "my high school\u2019s athletic trainer was forced to resign after buying students alcohol and inviting a CHILD over to his house for a massage!!! he now works at the catholic school in my home town \ud83e\udd74", "If you discover your 14-18 year old daughter is texting with a teacher that should trigger a red alarm in your brain imho. And I\u2019m not even a parent. Your example sounds much more reasonable. And was communicated to the parents.", "Hundreds of times for millions of people really doesnt make it that common. I just dislike this fear mongering in a world that has pretty much never been safer than now.", "Don't lock it up unless you need to.  Have a place outside of his room where he knows he can find it, but that it won't be right beside him.  Having a degree of control over his access to tech is not exclusionary to him being able to access tech in an emergency.", "Everyone seems to think that because an adult doesn\u2019t have kids they don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for kids. That is a messed up assumption.", "Each family  has it's  own dynamics. It's  not advisable  to interfere  for something  unsignificant as it's NOT YOUR PROBLEM.", "Don't cause an immediate crisis preventing a hypothetical emergency.\n\nFor the hope of sparing a few minutes in a situation that may never arise, you'll permit his bad habit? \n\nI know tone is hard to convey over text, and you're getting tons of weird advice from lots of different people. So I don't say this harshly.\n\nTake his phone at night; do it gently, part of having a set bedtime. If he needs an alarm, alarm clocks exist. Schedule yourself therapy; it sounds like you need a safety net of your own."]}
