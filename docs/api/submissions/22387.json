That\u2019s also way too much to ask", "NTA, i get the feeling they are trying to cut costs any way possible because that kind of a project is expensive, inflation made cost of materials go up a lot.  The thing for me is this is a project you aren't involved with, didn't start, and didn't ask for, therefore is not your responsibility.  $1500 is a lot of money to ask a new neighbor for!  If the neighbor wants a fence, they can finance it.", "NTA - there was a fence there and they ripped it out.  They removed it, they can replace it.", "NTA, it has never occurred to me to ask my neighbor to pay for a fence I put up. Just make sure it's on there side of the property line.", "INFO: who took down the original fence and was it a shared fence?", "NTA\n\nYou had a fence. They ripped it out. They need to replace it, cause if they hadnt ripped it out, you would still have a fence which neither of you would have needed to pay for.", "NTA.\n\nThere are two issues.  1st, your neighbors have no right to make a decision such as this without consulting you and then asking you to pay.  You should have been involved in making the decision if you are going to be asked for money.\n\n2nd, as you wrote, there is the relationship factor to consider.  If you are living alongside these people for years to come - and depending on what kind of people they are - a hard \"no\" may make things very difficult in the future and ruin your sense of comfort.\n\nI would talk to the neighbors, let them know they should have talked to you first if they wanted money for the project, but I would also try to work out an arrangement (unless you are opposed to the fence).  I am not saying that is the only correct response, and it may not be right for you, but considering the potential for long-term enmity, that is what I would do.  Either way, you are not an a-hole for refusing.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable for them to ask you to contribute but it\u2019s also reasonable for you to decline. You lost the existing fence to the construction. That was their (also apparently reasonable) decision. But now they are asking you to assume part of the cost of improving their property and replacing something that they had the need to remove - not you. \n\nAs far as keeping things neighborly for future years?? That\u2019s where it gets more sticky. For that reason alone, I would consider it. Having difficult or even just cold relations with neighbors can make a living situation uncomfortable. $1,500 is a small price to pay to start off on a good foot. No obligation to do so but something to consider.", "Info: If they're expecting you to contribute, do you get a say about how the fence looks? Or have they made all the decisions and just expect you to hand over money?", "INFO: Was the fence they ripped out shared on the property line? If it was shared, did they ask if it was okay to remove it before doing so? \n\nI mean, I think NTA either way. If you don't have a need for a fence and didn't care that it was gone, i'd just tell them that and that they can just put the fence on their property. Of course, this may upset them but it's a little bothersome they made these plans without consulting you on costs/materials if they intended on having you pay.", "Yeah thanks Demon. Will for sure offer to help put it up", "Thanks Shnipi, totally agree.", "That\u2019s the thing.. I like to be nice to everyone, especially my neighbors.

They did ask about taking out the old fence, and we accepted, but they had to in order to put in a retaining wall to build their house (due to new civil code). In doing so, we now have concrete patches where they put posts to do the retaining wall, which isn\u2019t ideal..", "Thanks. Yeah I get the same feeling!", "My thoughts exactly", "If a fence is directly on the property line.  In many places that makes it legally a shared fence, and both houses share responsibility.\n\nIf one wants a fence that is only theirs, in many places you have to build the fence entirely on your land, it can't actually be on the line.", "Interesting. Thanks man", "Yeah it was shared, but they never lived there. They just bought the block and started the build. They took it down as it was slightly crooked and went onto their property, but they asked if they could and we were fine with that as we were understanding since they were building and needed to do a retaining wall", "Agree Miss Suzie! Thanks!", "Thanks for your insight. They haven\u2019t started to do the fence or buy materials yet. They are sort of trying to involve us in the decision first and I commend them for that. They are trying to be good about it all. And so are we. I\u2019m a reasonable person, but just feel like this is a bit of a social expectation rather than something I should really have to contribute to.\nIf we really wanted a fence, we probably would\u2019ve put in one already/ used different materials..\nDunno. Trying to be nice and reasonable but at the same time not being taken for a ride", "Totally Igoos. \nAgree it is reasonable for them to ask. And reasonable to decline. But living next to them in doing so may be difficult. We won\u2019t be nasty and I don\u2019t expect that they will either. Just not jovial. And although I\u2019d prefer more rosy relations, am somewhat ok with that. \n\nAgree 1500 isn\u2019t huge, but it\u2019s not nothing, especially with my wife on maternity leave for a year, so a single income. \n\nPart of me wants to pay, but I feel that\u2019s just me wanting to please them. But will that actually do me any good?", "Kinda. So, since the block next door was split, the other (original) neighbors have negotiated with them for a type of fence and have already installed this on the other part of the block. Our new neighbors are proposing the same for continuity. We\u2019re not opposed to it, but if we were choosing, would probably go for something else..", "Yeah the original fence was already there. It wasn\u2019t quite straight and went slightly onto their property. I\u2019m talking less than a foot at the back corner. They asked if ok to remove, but they had to either way to build. It didn\u2019t matter if we said no. \n\nWe don\u2019t care it is gone. Don\u2019t care about a new one. So why should we pay?", "Ohhh, disregard my comment then. But still NTA. They\u2019re the one who wants a fence so they should pay for it.", "NAH. You gave permission to take the original down. Unfortunately, that was the time to discuss a replacement. You are a little on moral high ground here, but I don't think it unreasonable for them to ask you to share materials cost at this point.\n\nI would recommending reconsidering. Good fences make good neighbors, as the saying goes. And, if the other sides of your property are fenced, it will help your resale value in case you need to sale. Sharing costs will also give you a little leverage in what the final product looks like.", "Thanks. Appreciate your thoughts!", "Info. It will depend a bit on which country you are from. In the country I'm from you're required to pay for half the fence if it is placed on the property boundary with permission. The fence would be a joint property. This also lead to a culture in which it is expected to pay half of the cost.\n\nThe situation may be completely different where you are from. Cultural and country specific aspects are relevant for the \"verdict\".", "I\u2019m in Australia. But interesting what you say about cultural differences. Culturally I feel like I should pay, but culturally my wife is totally opposed, so\u2026 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Maybe you could try explaining that you're a single-income household at the moment and can't manage $1500, but maybe you could offer $500 and help install it? Or that you can't afford any money but again can help install it?\n\nYou're completely right to say no to any of it, but it might help with neighbourly relations moving forward.", "You may just want to look at it from a purely economical standpoint to see how it benefits you. Was the old fence trashy looking? Will your property value go up $1500 or more from the new fence? If so it may just be worth it for you in the long run as well as coming with the added benefit of better relations with your neighbours.\n\nWe built a new fence around our property a few years ago and all three of my neighbours had no problem contributing to it. I asked them before I began building it to see if they would be on board. I asked them each to cover half the material cost for the section of fence that would be bordering their respective properties. I would be doing the labour myself and I didn't bother charging them for that. The old fence was a major eyesore, leaning pretty badly and starting to rot. The new fence added to the property values and more than offset the cost of building it (it was roughly $500 per neighbour).\n\nStill, you aren't obligated to pay so NTA if you don't.", "You're definitely NTA. I understand wanting to keep things looking the same, but if they expect you to contribute, you should have a say in the style of fence. They should've had a better conversation with you about how to proceed before asking for you to split the costs.  That's pretty presumptive of them.  \n\nI also understand wanting to keep the peace too. You find yourself in an awkward position.  $1500 isn't nothing, but years of horrible neighbors makes life miserable.  \n\nIt better be a privacy fence they want installed if you decide not to contribute (just joking).\n\nETA: they really should've planned on paying for it themselves since they took the old one out.", "Thanks for your thoughts. \nAgree gave permission to take old fence down, but they would do so without any agreement as they had to in order to put up the retaining wall. So the agreement was moot. \n\nTotally not unreasonable for them to ask for us to pay some. I\u2019m fine with that. Just wondering AITA for saying no?\n\nOther sides are fenced. Not sure it adds much for resale..\n\nWe would prefer a different fence than what they are proposing, but are not opposed to it..", "Yeah will offer to help install it. And consider a lower payment. Thanks for your insight!", "Thanks Barbarian, I don\u2019t think that the fence will actually contribute to the property value for us or them. It\u2019s so inconsequential for an urban property.. so economically, I don\u2019t think it is a worthwhile investment as it will provide close to 0 ROI and almost 0 utility.", "Thanks ExEiverFish. Agree with such a long build there was ample time to suggest fence type etc and to get to an understanding. Don\u2019t like that now things are wrapping up and a fence is at the forefront of their mind that I need to be rushed into a decision and contribute", "Well, I asked about the original to see if they were AH or not. If they took it down without your agreement, that would change the advice.\n\nI don't think anyone is the AH here. It's reasonable for them to ask and reasonable for you to politely decline. \n\nI would do a quick check of laws in your area. I just looked. In my state, fences on property lines are legally a shared cost. This doesn't legally require anyone to pay for a fence as if one owner disagrees, the other can build the fence on their property. If the fence goes up on the line, both parties are responsible for upkeep 50/50. \n\nIf you're in an HOA, things may be even more complicated. Modern living, so complicated. SMH.", "Thanks bud!", "NTA This is easy: THEY destroyed your fence. So THEY will need to pay for a new one.\n\nHopefully you have documentation.", "I would have consulted an attorney the day after they ripped out the old fence.  \n\nGet an appointment tomorrow, OP.\n\nAt the least I'd tell them to put the old fence back.", "1. You had a fence and they tore it down (with your permission).  It seems a little bold to now ask you for money to replace YOUR fence which They tore down.\n2. Your post does give any details on the fence, but $3,000 seems like a lot for just materials for what I assume is a single section of wood fencing.  If you do decide to split the cost, make certain that that is what is actually happening.\n3. NTA", "Nta. How long does the fence run jointly to both properties. $3000 just for materials sounds pricey. Assuming they are paying 50% for materials also.\n\nTBH if I'm splitting a fence with a neighbor I would at least get an estimate to see the price difference. And then ask to see the receipts for material to make sure you are paying the correct amount", "Also if you pay towards the fence you can make sure it \"faces front\" from both sides. Otherwise you may be looking at the \"back\" of the fence (if that's something you care about).", "NTA", "NAH.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with \"asking\".  If your neighbor all of a sudden turns into the rudest neighbor ever, because you don't want to give away free money, then I'll change my judgement.\n\nIt sounds like the previously existing fence, was shared / co-owned.  Your neighbor NEEDED to destroy the existing shared / co-owned fence in order to have enough room to build on their property (a retaining wall).\n\nThe neighbor has the firm obligation to rebuild a new fence, of like materials, and like design, at their own 100% cost, AND the fence would still be considered shared / co-owned.\n\nThis isn't r/legaladvice, so no point in discussing actual laws, but I believe I've described things as neutral and un-bias as possible.\n\nFurthermore, don't offer to help install the fence.  All of a sudden if something goes wrong you could be blamed and liable for damages.  Offering water and lemonade never hurts.\n\nGood Luck.\n\n<QUOTE>\n\nAITA for not wanting to pay for half of a new fence (self.AmItheAsshole)\n\nsubmitted 5 hours ago * by unlikey_fashion\n\nSo, we have lived at our house for 2 years now on an urban block.

We put it as close to the property line as possible on our property, pay for it ourselves, and it is our fence. We can then do with it what we like. If you pay for part of it, are you then responsible for it going forward? Will they expect you to contribute to maintenance? What if it is damaged in a storm? What if you decide you want to install a gate or that you don\u2019t like the fence, will you be able to modify it? It\u2019s just easier if the fence has one owner only, and that owner should fully fund the fence.", "NTA. Do not pay for this fence and do not help to put it up without knowing local laws and possibly surveying the land first. **Depending on your local laws, putting up a new fence can re-define the property line after some time and they could be taking some of your land, intentionally or unintentionally**. In America you'd want to talk to someone in planning and zoning, or business and neighborhood services (or whatever local equivalent).", "Vote back pls", "NTA - my neighbor tried this with me. We sincerely didn't have any extra cash to contribute to a fence, nor did we have skills to help assemble it. We just told her, \"Sorry, no, we can't contribute. If YOU wish to put up a fence, then YOU can pay for it. We're ok with things as they are.\" Magically, she paid for the fence to be installed 100%.", "There's a reason for the phrase, \"Good fences make good neighbors\". I have always assumed that part of home ownership in an urban/suburban area with small lots is that 50% of any fencing will be my responsibility.\n\nSeems like the fencing discussion should have happened back when the original fence was removed. If that fence was in good condition and the only reason for removal was revised property lines in subdividing their lot, then any replacement fence would be on them as a new construction expense. But if the fence was in poor condition and needed replacement, anyway, then OP should pay 50%. \n\nEither way, having the convo back when the original fence was demolished would have been less awkward.", "Is this fence partially on your property too? In the city I  live in you have to get a permit to build a fence and it has to be a certain amount of feet from your property line. When we put ours up we had to pay to have our yard surveyed and then our property lines marked before we were approved for a fencing permit. You might want to look into what the requirements are where you live before your neighbor starts to install the fence. Make sure they aren't \" stealing\" part of your lot by building their fence directly on the property line or something like that and that if the fence they originally took down was actually owned by just them.", "That also depends, in some areas, the installer only gets the \"front facing\" on ONE side of the property.", "You need a permit in most places, but you can still build the fence yourself. The rules in many places also depend on whether both neighbors agree to the fence or not. If only one neighbor wants the fence, it has to be set back a certain distance from the property line. If both agree, the fence can be directly on the boundary and both parties are equally responsible for all installation and maintenance costs. If you move into a property with an existing fence on the property line, you're still required to pay for half of any upkeep or replacement costs since it was already there when you bought the property. \n\nIn this situation, it seems like the fence that the neighbors tore down was set back on their own property since they had to remove it to put in the retaining wall. If that's the case, then OP is definitely not obligated to pay anything toward the cost of the new fence and it has to be set back from the property line on the neighbor's land. As you said, I would definitely recommend getting a survey done or at least trying to find the metal boundary stakes just to be sure that they build the fence on their own land.", "You usually have to pay extra to have a \"good neighbor\" fence aka one with two \"fronts\" because it requires extra materials and labor.", "NAH depending on where you\u2019re at, some places in the US have fencing laws. Basically, neighbors shake hands in the middle and everything to their right, they have to pay for. Honestly, it\u2019s just easier and cheaper to have the cost split in half and have one person take care of it. Check into your fencing laws though.", "When I bought my house, I had to install a 6' privacy fence around my back yard before I could move in because one of the dogs I had at the time could jump over a 5' fence. (To be honest, she probably could have jumped a 6' fence too, but she didn't seem to realize it, and I wasn't about to explain it to her.)\n\nAnyway, my house is on a corner, so I only have one true next-door neighbor, and she had a 4' chain-link fence around her back yard. I offered to remove the one side of chain link (at *my* expense), install my wood fence, and affix the ends of her fence to mine so there wouldn't be a gap for her dog to wriggle through, but she wasn't interested. So one side of my fence is, like, 2-3\" away from her fence. \ud83e\udd37\n\nMy point here is that, had she agreed, I fully expected to bear the entire expense of removing (part of) her fence and attaching what remained to mine, even though there was absolutely no benefit to me \u2013 it neither helps nor hurts me to have her fence there, and it would have neither helped nor hurt me to have it gone \u2013 but if it had been done, it would have been done at *my request,* so it should also have been done at *my expense.*\n\nOP's new neighbors took down OP's old fence, so the new neighbors should replace it, *at their expense.*\n\nThat said, the benefits of having a positive relationship with one's neighbors are hard to overstate, and the drawbacks of having a negative and/or antagonistic one are legion. So while I think OP's neighbors were pretty damned presumptuous even to ask for a financial contribution to replacing a fence *they* took down, in the grand scheme of things and over the long term, it could be worth it to OP to chip in for the new fence in the interest of building a good relationship with these new neighbors. (Though one could also argue that the other way, and say that the new neighbors might want to hear the full cost in order to help them build a positive relationship with OP.) However, I also think that OP could talk to them about either contributing a smaller amount, and/or (as mentioned in the edit) offering to lend a hand with the construction.", "Honestly, you should have sorted out who should replace the fence at that time, they definitely should be paying for it 100%.", "They couldn't have taken the shared fence down without your permission, the fact they needed to for their building work means nothing.", "Why not offer $500 and help installing?", "Some places don't allow them as the space between the sides can make a home for mice and rats.", "NTA but check your laws. My neighbor also tore down our shared fence. Also built a new one and sent us the bill for half. I THOUGHT I was safe since I didn\u2019t ask for any of that. I didn\u2019t say I would share the cost. But. In my state. They can sue us for half the cost of the fence as it\u2019s shared and maintenance thing. I truly had no idea.  I didn\u2019t allot for the cost of a fence. Especially since my half is 2300. I\u2019ve looked it up. Spoke to a lawyer. And yep. I have to pay. Luckily I can do so in  Installments.

I said \"you are more than welcome to do whatever you like, but the fence I'm saving for is less than that for our entire property since we plan on doing it ourselves\" \n\nHe's very nosy about money and overshares about his income. He makes twice what my husband and I do, and paid about twice as much for the same house as we have (fucking property values are BS). Good for him, good for his fence.

But if you prefer to go without a fence between the properties, I\u2019m fine with that too\u201d That way you sound accommodating of their preferences for fencing without essentially paying for part of their upgrade", "You are being neighborly as it is \u2014 their retaining wall apparently has lead to concrete crossing over into your yard not to mention that you\u2019ve been accommodating with all of their work. I would let them know that since they took down the original fence for their construction, you expected that they would be responsible for reinstalling a replacement when construction was done.", "When neighbors unilaterally tear down an existing fence, this probably nullifies any sort of joint responsibility if that were even to exist. They could have saved those fencing panels and reinstalled it once their yard redo was complete.", "From my understanding it doesn\u2019t nullify anything.  \n\nhttps://www.findlaw.com/realestate/neighbors/fencing-on-property-line-who-pays-for-and-maintains-it.html#:~:text=However%2C%20in%20most%20jurisdictions%2C%20both,decision%20to%20erect%20the%20fence.", "You\u2019re definitely not the AH saying no! I personally think they veer into mild AH territory asking you to contribute for the new one after they tore down the prior fence for their construction.", "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t even get into offering a payment because that becomes a slippery slope and is possibly more likely to lead to bad feelings. I would let them know that you expected that they would reinstall the fence when their construction was completed when you talked about taking the previous fence down. And you sadly don\u2019t have the budget for a fence. But you\u2019re happy to help with labor. That\u2019s neighborly"]}
