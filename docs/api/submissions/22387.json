They didn\u2019t even consult you for that and that was your property. That\u2019s also way too much to ask", "NTA, i get the feeling they are trying to cut costs any way possible because that kind of a project is expensive, inflation made cost of materials go up a lot.  The thing for me is this is a project you aren't involved with, didn't start, and didn't ask for, therefore is not your responsibility.  $1500 is a lot of money to ask a new neighbor for!  If the neighbor wants a fence, they can finance it.", "NTA - there was a fence there and they ripped it out.  They removed it, they can replace it.", "NTA, it has never occurred to me to ask my neighbor to pay for a fence I put up. Just make sure it's on there side of the property line.", "INFO: who took down the original fence and was it a shared fence?", "NTA\n\nYou had a fence. They ripped it out. They need to replace it, cause if they hadnt ripped it out, you would still have a fence which neither of you would have needed to pay for.", "NTA.\n\nThere are two issues.  1st, your neighbors have no right to make a decision such as this without consulting you and then asking you to pay.  You should have been involved in making the decision if you are going to be asked for money.\n\n2nd, as you wrote, there is the relationship factor to consider.  If you are living alongside these people for years to come - and depending on what kind of people they are - a hard \"no\" may make things very difficult in the future and ruin your sense of comfort.\n\nI would talk to the neighbors, let them know they should have talked to you first if they wanted money for the project, but I would also try to work out an arrangement (unless you are opposed to the fence).  I am not saying that is the only correct response, and it may not be right for you, but considering the potential for long-term enmity, that is what I would do.  Either way, you are not an a-hole for refusing.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable for them to ask you to contribute but it\u2019s also reasonable for you to decline. You lost the existing fence to the construction. That was their (also apparently reasonable) decision. But now they are asking you to assume part of the cost of improving their property and replacing something that they had the need to remove - not you. \n\nAs far as keeping things neighborly for future years?? That\u2019s where it gets more sticky. For that reason alone, I would consider it. Having difficult or even just cold relations with neighbors can make a living situation uncomfortable. $1,500 is a small price to pay to start off on a good foot. No obligation to do so but something to consider.", "Info: If they're expecting you to contribute, do you get a say about how the fence looks? Or have they made all the decisions and just expect you to hand over money?", "INFO: Was the fence they ripped out shared on the property line? If it was shared, did they ask if it was okay to remove it before doing so? \n\nI mean, I think NTA either way. If you don't have a need for a fence and didn't care that it was gone, i'd just tell them that and that they can just put the fence on their property. Of course, this may upset them but it's a little bothersome they made these plans without consulting you on costs/materials if they intended on having you pay.", "Yeah thanks Demon. Will for sure offer to help put it up", "Thanks Shnipi, totally agree.", "That\u2019s the thing.. I like to be nice to everyone, especially my neighbors. But I don\u2019t like to feel obligated to pay for things. I don\u2019t get the sense that we will be close neighbors, despite the fact that we have created good relations with so many others in the neighborhood", "Thanks mate. They did ask about taking out the old fence, and we accepted, but they had to in order to put in a retaining wall to build their house (due to new civil code). In doing so, we now have concrete patches where they put posts to do the retaining wall, which isn\u2019t ideal..", "Thanks. Yeah I get the same feeling!", "My thoughts exactly", "If a fence is directly on the property line.  In many places that makes it legally a shared fence, and both houses share responsibility.\n\nIf one wants a fence that is only theirs, in many places you have to build the fence entirely on your land, it can't actually be on the line.", "Interesting. Thanks man", "Yeah it was shared, but they never lived there. They just bought the block and started the build. They took it down as it was slightly crooked and went onto their property, but they asked if they could and we were fine with that as we were understanding since they were building and needed to do a retaining wall", "Agree Miss Suzie! Thanks!", "Thanks for your insight. They haven\u2019t started to do the fence or buy materials yet. They are sort of trying to involve us in the decision first and I commend them for that. They are trying to be good about it all. And so are we. I\u2019m a reasonable person, but just feel like this is a bit of a social expectation rather than something I should really have to contribute to.\nIf we really wanted a fence, we probably would\u2019ve put in one already/ used different materials..\nDunno. Trying to be nice and reasonable but at the same time not being taken for a ride", "Totally Igoos. \nAgree it is reasonable for them to ask. And reasonable to decline. But living next to them in doing so may be difficult. We won\u2019t be nasty and I don\u2019t expect that they will either. Just not jovial. And although I\u2019d prefer more rosy relations, am somewhat ok with that. \n\nAgree 1500 isn\u2019t huge, but it\u2019s not nothing, especially with my wife on maternity leave for a year, so a single income. \n\nPart of me wants to pay, but I feel that\u2019s just me wanting to please them. But will that actually do me any good?", "Kinda. So, since the block next door was split, the other (original) neighbors have negotiated with them for a type of fence and have already installed this on the other part of the block. Our new neighbors are proposing the same for continuity. We\u2019re not opposed to it, but if we were choosing, would probably go for something else..", "Yeah the original fence was already there. It wasn\u2019t quite straight and went slightly onto their property. I\u2019m talking less than a foot at the back corner. They asked if ok to remove, but they had to either way to build. It didn\u2019t matter if we said no. \n\nWe don\u2019t care it is gone. Don\u2019t care about a new one. So why should we pay?", "Ohhh, disregard my comment then. But still NTA. They\u2019re the one who wants a fence so they should pay for it.", "NAH. You gave permission to take the original down. Unfortunately, that was the time to discuss a replacement. You are a little on moral high ground here, but I don't think it unreasonable for them to ask you to share materials cost at this point.\n\nI would recommending reconsidering. Good fences make good neighbors, as the saying goes. And, if the other sides of your property are fenced, it will help your resale value in case you need to sale. Sharing costs will also give you a little leverage in what the final product looks like.", "Thanks. Appreciate your thoughts!", "Info. It will depend a bit on which country you are from. In the country I'm from you're required to pay for half the fence if it is placed on the property boundary with permission. The fence would be a joint property. This also lead to a culture in which it is expected to pay half of the cost.\n\nThe situation may be completely different where you are from. Cultural and country specific aspects are relevant for the \"verdict\".", "I\u2019m in Australia. But interesting what you say about cultural differences. Culturally I feel like I should pay, but culturally my wife is totally opposed, so\u2026 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Maybe you could try explaining that you're a single-income household at the moment and can't manage $1500, but maybe you could offer $500 and help install it? Or that you can't afford any money but again can help install it?\n\nYou're completely right to say no to any of it, but it might help with neighbourly relations moving forward.", "You may just want to look at it from a purely economical standpoint to see how it benefits you. Was the old fence trashy looking? Will your property value go up $1500 or more from the new fence? If so it may just be worth it for you in the long run as well as coming with the added benefit of better relations with your neighbours.\n\nWe built a new fence around our property a few years ago and all three of my neighbours had no problem contributing to it. I asked them before I began building it to see if they would be on board. I asked them each to cover half the material cost for the section of fence that would be bordering their respective properties. I would be doing the labour myself and I didn't bother charging them for that. The old fence was a major eyesore, leaning pretty badly and starting to rot. The new fence added to the property values and more than offset the cost of building it (it was roughly $500 per neighbour).\n\nStill, you aren't obligated to pay so NTA if you don't.", "You're definitely NTA. I understand wanting to keep things looking the same, but if they expect you to contribute, you should have a say in the style of fence. They should've had a better conversation with you about how to proceed before asking for you to split the costs.  That's pretty presumptive of them.  \n\nI also understand wanting to keep the peace too. You find yourself in an awkward position.  $1500 isn't nothing, but years of horrible neighbors makes life miserable.  \n\nIt better be a privacy fence they want installed if you decide not to contribute (just joking).\n\nETA: they really should've planned on paying for it themselves since they took the old one out.", "Thanks for your thoughts. \nAgree gave permission to take old fence down, but they would do so without any agreement as they had to in order to put up the retaining wall. So the agreement was moot. \n\nTotally not unreasonable for them to ask for us to pay some. I\u2019m fine with that. Just wondering AITA for saying no?\n\nOther sides are fenced. Not sure it adds much for resale..\n\nWe would prefer a different fence than what they are proposing, but are not opposed to it..", "Yeah will offer to help install it. And consider a lower payment. Thanks for your insight!", "Thanks Barbarian, I don\u2019t think that the fence will actually contribute to the property value for us or them. It\u2019s so inconsequential for an urban property.. so economically, I don\u2019t think it is a worthwhile investment as it will provide close to 0 ROI and almost 0 utility.", "Thanks ExEiverFish. Agree with such a long build there was ample time to suggest fence type etc and to get to an understanding. Don\u2019t like that now things are wrapping up and a fence is at the forefront of their mind that I need to be rushed into a decision and contribute", "Well, I asked about the original to see if they were AH or not. If they took it down without your agreement, that would change the advice.\n\nI don't think anyone is the AH here. It's reasonable for them to ask and reasonable for you to politely decline. \n\nI would do a quick check of laws in your area. I just looked. In my state, fences on property lines are legally a shared cost. This doesn't legally require anyone to pay for a fence as if one owner disagrees, the other can build the fence on their property. If the fence goes up on the line, both parties are responsible for upkeep 50/50. \n\nIf you're in an HOA, things may be even more complicated. Modern living, so complicated. SMH.", "Thanks bud!"]}
