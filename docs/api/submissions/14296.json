She isn\u2019t respecting your friends and process.  She maybe showing off or impatient.  You don\u2019t need to include her in everything you do.", "NTA \n\nYou asked her to tone it down so everyone could have fun, and she refused. The whole point of the Escape Room is to have fun as a group.", "NTA. You have her a chance to not ruin the experience and she continued the bad behavior, so now she\u2019s not invited anymore. That\u2019s totally fair. It\u2019s supposed to be a group activity and she ruined it for others.", "NTA, you talked to her about this & was cool for the first two puzzles then all that went out the window showing she doesn't care about what you said.", "NTA She shouldn\u2019t be mad. Everyone recognizes that she\u2019s the best player by a mile, and it\u2019s no fun to watch her solve the puzzles. One solution might be to put her in a room on her own while the rest of you play in another room & see who finishes first. I\u2019m betting she wouldn\u2019t love that, either, though.", "NTA. You're allowed to do things with your friends without your gf. She needs to accept that and deal with it.", "NTA maybe skip out on inviting her to future escape room endeavours all together. It\u2019s pretty selfish of her to keep doing the puzzles on her own especially when you\u2019ve communicated the groups contempt regarding that. There\u2019s also the case of her wanting to feel included but there are ways of  going about that whilst being mindful of everyone else\u2019s feelings in the room.", "NTA. Your gf should contemplate whether she's comfortable being in a relationship where she's smarter than everyone else, if indeed she is -- but your conduct throughout has been impeccable.", "NTA. \nStrange behavior. I would also keep an eye on the relationship overall. She seems kind of inconsiderate and selfish.", "You explained the situation to your GF and asked for a behavioral change that would allow everyone to have fun.  Your GF didn't change.  She could have changed, but she made a decision not to.  In a sense, the decision not to be included is hers.

She should take herself back a little and wait instead of getting carried away and ruin everything for the rest.", "I think NAH. It feels like a no win situation. If she participates, you and your friends don\u2019t have fun. If she tones it down, she gets bored and doesn\u2019t have fun. If she doesn\u2019t go at all, she feels like she\u2019s missing out. \n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not malicious. She just likes puzzles. Liking puzzles and knowing the answer and having to just sit on it must suck.", "NAH. Either way someone isn't going to be having fun in the full group which is understandable all around...just get 2 rooms maybe.", "NAH\n\nYou don't sound compatible for this activity, when there is a really big skill difference either she does it and others don't have fun, or she stands there knowing the solution watching others fail at something she figured out ages ago.  If your local rooms offer different levels of difficulty maybe you could all have lunch and then she could do a hard room while you guys do an easier room.", "NTA. She\u2019s not being a team player, which is an AH move in a team event. You tried to find a compromise here, and she could or would not follow it. You\u2019re entitled to have your own fun without your partner on occasion; this may just be one of those things where you aren\u2019t compatible.", "NTA\n\n\nORIGINAL COMMENT:\nESH. You for excluding her instead of learning from her and she for solving all the puzzles by herself and not giving anyone else a chance.\n\nMy advice? Sit down, and have a nice, long, rational discussion about this. Iron out the problems. This petty s\\*\\*t is not worth losing a relationship for.\n\nEdit: After reading OP's comment, I change my judgement to NTA", "Info - you said after she spoke with you she held back and let you guys solve puzzles together before she started participating. What did success look like to you? That she not participate at all? That she held off on more before joining in? Was it clear to her what the goal was? I\u2019ve done escape rooms before and all the ones I have participated in have several simultaneous puzzles happening at the same time. Is there any reason that you and your friends couldn\u2019t be solving a different puzzle at the same time?", "ESH. It\u2019s not fair for your gf to be sitting at home alone while the rest of the friend group and partners go out having fun. But at the same time, if she\u2019s ruining the fun for everyone she should slow down a bit, especially since you told her (hopefully politely?) how everyone feels.", "YTA.

I love escape rooms and I am really good at them, so, when I go with other people sometimes I have to take a step back so other people can enjoy them.

That might work. It never occurred to me to rent two rooms at the same place.", "Huh?? She\u2019s being selfish by not pretending to not be smart??", "I did talk with her beforehand and asked her to just slow down a bit before we went to the escape room a third time. I tried to explain that this was kind of special for us and that we weren't finding it very fun to have her solve all of the puzzles.", "She sort of slowed down and just helped us, but she gets it done really fast and seemed frustrated at how slow we were going. And we have done it with simultaneous puzzles, but she can usually do three or four in the time it takes us to do one or two, so we'd be working on separate puzzles, but she'd finish hers, then come and do the rest of them herself.", "She's still invited everywhere else. We go out for drinks or dinner sometimes, and she's always welcome to come to that. I also pointed out some of my favorite escape rooms in case she would be interested in doing some solo because she seems to find it fun. I also bought her a cool-looking wooden puzzle set.

Great for her that she\u2019s good at this shit but it\u2019s literally basic manners not to do what she\u2019s doing .. and especially after being told it\u2019s upsetting people by doing it", "Being selfish by continuing to participate in an event with people who are clearly her inferiors and at their expense. She\u2019s taking the fun from everyone else because she is so much better than they are. This wasn\u2019t even her friend group to begin with.\n\nShe should find people who are at a more comparable skill level.", "Yeah OP you are good. You did talk to her. The only thing I'd add is that you guys should have called her out while she was doing it. I dont have escape rooms where I live but I imagine there are tome limits and I imagine she just got too enthusiastic and eager to solve by the deadline. Maybe a warning in the midst of it would have changed her behavior?\n\nBut I get, tou guys also don't have to do everything together.

It\u2019s a \u201etry to be part of a team\u201c thing. \n\nIf this were basketball instead of an escape room, and one person played on a higher level than the others to the degree where they won all the games on their own, the judgement would be the same. \n\nIf you participate in a team event, but you do all the activities on your own, you\u2019re an AH. Either adjust your speed to that of the lesser players, or find a group on your level.", "I meant when he first talked to her though. What was the goal he wanted from her.", "You said she did slow down and help. Later she did some while you guys worked on other puzzles. I feel like YTA because you talked to her, and she did change the way she was playing to make room for you guys, but what you really wanted was for her to not be better at it. It would have been better if you had just explained from the beginning and not invited her instead of asking her to change and then uninviting her anyway.", "She changed for a little bit, then went back to how it was, with her doing it all herself.
