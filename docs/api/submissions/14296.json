She may have become defensive and not realized that the real issue is that she is essentially hogging the entire experience, which is not cool no matter how good she is at it. \n\nCould you maybe offer her one more chance where you enforce taking turns in a rotation on the puzzles, if that is possible? If she is missing the social cues that tell her no one else is having fun standing around while she blows through every puzzle, she may need a more concrete direction like a turn order. And if she falls back into her old ways, you need to call her out on it in the moment and see if it gets through to her. \"Hey, Joe was in the middle of saying something, hear him out,\" \"Dave found that clue, let him have a shot figuring out where it goes,\" etc.\n\nThat being said, I know it kind of sucks that everyone else was able to work collaboratively before without a restriction like a turn order, but maybe give it one single shot more and see if everyone is able to enjoy themselves.

Good rooms usually have a few things going on, but I've seen plenty that are basically a linear series of puzzles. \n\n\nI'm more curious how there's such a skill gap, considering this whole group routinely plays together, and she's the new one. A whole room usually requires a lot of different skills. Solving riddles, jigsaw puzzles, math clues, word puzzles,  just noticing hidden objects, and so on.

Meaning socializing is part of it.", "It would be really hard to beat the harder rooms unless you divide and conquer. Also trying to have the whole group work on one puzzle really doesn\u2019t work well\u2014too many varying opinions. We\u2019ve always worked best splitting into 1-3 people per puzzle.

Being a know-it-all isn't fun for your friends. Ask me how I know, lol.\n\nMy impulse is always to give the answer first.

I feel like that works out rather well. \nOverall, the moments I cherish most are the one\u2019s where someone else understood something I didn\u2019t, typically where out of the box thinking is necessary instead of the usual logical, more straightforward thinking that is often needed. \nOh and maybe tell your gf to instead create her own escape puzzles, I had a lot of fun building a wooden box with locks and create puzzles and stuff and then watching my mom solve the puzzles and finally open the box.", "She doesn't have the same goals as the rest of the group, so she doesn't need to go with the rest of the group. Take her to an escape room on her own, or do something else with her, where she can take the lead.\n\nNTA.", "So I started playing Terraria with my kids, 18m and 10m. 18m doesn't live with us, and had some school stuff going on (sports, grades, work, you name it) and didn't join us for a couple months, but 10m and I continued playing.\n\n10m and I got to know the game systems, memorized what we'd need to fast start, shortcuts to get better gear, etc. So when 18m rejoined us, even when we created a fresh world, he was completely out of his league. This was obviously not intentional, and I made a point of not twinking him or running ahead of him so much, but 10m is 10, and he just blasted ahead to the next thing as fast as he could so he could summon the next boss because boss fights are his favorite part. 18m got a little butthurt about it, and we had to move on to another game. I mean I was glad in a way, because it gave me a chance to point out the issues to 10m, hoping he'll learn something about playing nice, so to speak.\n\nBut there's no question in my mind that your GF is basically my 10 yr old writ older, OP. If she refuses to hold back, you basically have no choice but to pick her or your friends. Compromise is absolutely key in any relationship, and I worry this may be a tough thing for her, compromise of any kind.\n\nYou're NTA, OP. Good luck.", "NAH - she can\u2019t help that she\u2019s just better at it then everyone else and it would probably as boring for her to sit and watch everyone solve a puzzle she already figured out as it is for you guys to watch her solve them all by herself. No one here is guilty of AH behavior. Likewise - you don\u2019t need to do *everything* together. \n\nHave you considered making it competitive in such a way that her advantage is an asset? Maybe doing two groups and splitting the teams up randomly so that there\u2019s some variety? Idk that\u2019s just the first idea I came up with", "YTA. So are your friends. She's good at something so you punish HER instead of working to get better for yourself.", "NTA for someone good at puzzles she really missed a lot of social clues. She missed the point of why you guys were there, it\u2019s not so she can impress everyone with her ability to solve the puzzle herself.", "NTA, anytime you're doing a social activity for fun, and some are better than others, if you know relaxing a bit so others can participate makes it more fun for everyone, than you should do that.\n\nShe obviously doesn't care enough about the enjoyment of everyone else, at least not enough to make a decent conscious effort.\n\nThis is honestly kind of a red flag.  Not the biggest one ever, but it could be a trait that can lead to bigger problems later.", "NTA. She\u2019s selfish. And too advanced for the escape rooms maybe. It\u2019s not fun if she\u2019s doing them all herself. She can just go alone.", "Lol I feel for your girlfriend, my family REFUSES to do escape rooms with me because I solve them all too fast! Sorta TA, she should really learn to take a step back and let other people participate, but I get how hard that is. Hence, my own ban. NTA", "This post screams \"I have a Neurodivergent girlfriend\". \n\nSounds like she gets excited and jumps into solving, and it can be hard to step back and watch others struggle with something that seems really simple. \n\nI like the idea somewhere else on here of having her do another room and race you guys. \n\nI'd also recommend another conversation with her but KEEP IT POSITIVE. \n\n\"Babe, I love you and you are brilliant. It's crazy how good you are at solving puzzles and solving them fast. But (friends) and I need more time to solve the puzzles and it can be challenging going with you because I know you -get- them and are excited to solve the puzzles.  I want to find a way for everyone to be able to be challenged. What do you think about two rooms next time, or do you have any thoughts on how we can make sure that the group is able to participate fully, AND you have fun?\"", "NTA\n\nShe's being hugely inconsiderate of others needs. I understand the urge when you know the answer to take over but it's a skill that we need to learn to rein that urge in and share!\n\nShe was given the chance to change her behaviour and either refused it wasn't able to.\n\nShe isn't entitled to ruin everyone else's fun, so you and your friends are NTA in ending to exclude her.", "Time to break with her. Let her be with someone who isn't trying to change her. You will both be happier.", "NTA, as someone who also plays a lot of escape rooms, making a team you enjoy playing with is really important. I've dropped players and I'm always tuning up my roster. I don't think the request was doable. Is not like someone running slower in a marathon, is more like playing basketball and asking someone to not score. Asking her not to solve the puzzles as fast was never gonna work. \nShe could get into local groups that are.more hardcore and play more competitively. Where I live we have a WhatsApp group with people who play once a week or more. I don't really agree with other commenters saying she should play at the same time but alone. Even if she wins, it feels a little empty (coming from experience).", "NTA. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I'm usually in your gfs place. Generally ahead and sick of having to slow down for everybody else. Regardless, sometimes you have to to be considerate. That's just life and life isn't perfect.

Your girlfriend is not a team player.", "NTA, but do they have harder puzzles that would be a challenger for her, maybe that way it can be more of a collaboration", "NTA - but maybe it would work if you had a code word she agreed to. When she starts going into hyperdrive you quietly say \u201cCheeze-its\u201d and that\u2019s her cue to take a time out. The trick will be convincing your friends to let her try again. Can you afford to foot the bill to make that happen?", "nta, i hate people who come in and take over stuff.", "NTA. If she keeps coming and solving all the puzzles herself, you and your friends won\u2019t have fun. But if she sits back and has to wait on you guys to solve everything at your own pace, that\u2019s no fun for her. Instead of having her do a room by herself, I would probably encourage her to see if there\u2019s some kind of community she could join of avid escape room players who would be more on her level.\n\nMy sister and I took my niece and her friends for her 9th bday to an escape room, and it was torture to have to play at their level, but I certainly would rather do that again than have to do what should be a fun group activity all alone.", "Nta", "NTA In boardgame circles we call this \"Quarterbacking\" - where one player takes over and tells everyone else what to do. Might be worth pointing this out to her again, with the context it may help?", "no, not the asshole. \n\nthis actually should be a warning flag for you. \n\nyou asked her nicely to be part of the team. work WITH the group, not against it. and she ignored you. twice. \n\nso, you have to now start asking yourself this....what is life going to be like long term?", "I was waiting for one commenter saying OP is being sexist towards his gf because she's a woman. Faith restored a bit. Redditors can think logically too", "NTA\n\nIs it possible she\u2019s already done all these several times and that\u2019s why she solves them so fast? Maybe she\u2019s trying to impress you but is impatient and solves them quickly because she\u2019s bored and doesn\u2019t care if anyone has fun", "nta as a quick puzzle solver I stand back sometimes to let them have their moment. My kids were a great teacher for me doing so. give her time to get this. she might feel the urge to feel important to your group to still get invited.", "This is the answer! That way she\u2019s included and neither she nor you or your friends feel excluded. Great idea to have her create the room and clues!", "NAH. \n\nThis is just incompatibility. \n\nIt's not fun to have only one person complete the puzzles, but it's also the most miserable experience to have to watch a group of people take 3 yrs on a puzzle you figured out in like 5 minutes and is required to move to the next step. \n\nIt also sucks to be incompatible with people who are doing an activity that you really want to be involved in. \n\nI agree with some of the commenters that maybe you could do two rooms. Maybe she \"recruits\" a team and you guys race to the finish in separate rooms.\n\n Maybe there are \"escape room\" leagues you could recommend to her so she could still have a chance to complete them with her skill level?", "NTA. I'm not \"your girlfriend\" (not even a girl) , but I'm your girlfriend. I understand that it can be hard to turn off intellectual advantages (and yes, I know that sounds arrogant), but being clever means that she should be able to realize when her input is detracting from the group experience.\n\nAt the end of the day, this isn't about how good at puzzles she is, it's about her behavior. Instead of allowing everyone a chance to shine, she's selfishly making it about her own abilities. It's fair that she wants to engage too, but she needs to learn to be a team player and participate without excluding others. If she wants to participate in a group activity then she needs to shift to group behavior and drop the all-star act.", "NTA she\u2019s killing the vibe for everyone by not knowing how to be a team player. It\u2019s one thing to be smart it\u2019s another to ruin the escape room for everybody else.", "NTA. We rent separate rooms alot. Usually guys against girls, but she could try solo since she basically does it alone anyways!", "NTA.. For reasons already listed", "NTA. When they say its not the winning, it's the  taking part that counts - that goes for winners and losers.\n\nEveryone knows that the person who likes to 'win' all the time and does so, eventually stops getting invited to play altogether. This is basic mammalian social dynamics. Its been studied to death.\n\nI know this isnt a win or lose situation exactly, but the principle is the same - and its upsetting your group. You have been very patient and mature about this.

Your GF reminds me of a roommate I had. But she was a year younger. It kind of sucks.", "NAH", "NTA.  \n\nI got sick of pulling everyone else along on group projects waaaay back in school.  Why would she want to continue doing it in her free time, and PAYING for it, too?  \n\nShe probably just wants to be included in your friend group, so maybe find a different activity everyone can enjoy on the same level.", "NTA, I was an escape room game master, people like that were the worst. I\u2019d see people go as far as doing the room by themselves and then coming back with a group to show off and it never worked out because everyone else would stand around instead of having fun. I hated watching it on the cameras, and so did my co workers.", "NAH. I have a friend who isn\u2019t great at video games but I love playing video games with her. I am much better but I know to tone it down when I\u2019m with her. It\u2019s really hard to find that balance and some games don\u2019t allow for it. Usually I give myself a challenge to do or I mess with her. For example in Mario kart I\u2019ll often turn around and throw items at her, which at first she is upset but then joins in so we end up sitting around throwing items at each other. Hilarious.\n\nEscape rooms are probably really tricky for it. It\u2019s not fair for her to have to hold herself back, but it\u2019s also not fair for her to be doing the whole thing before you. If she recognizes she is much better, you could try doing a competition, her against the group. Idk if she\u2019d be up for that though depending on your dynamic. She clearly enjoys them so I think you should still invite her.

Myself and one other did 5 of the required puzzles waiting for the other 2 pairs to get each of theirs done then doing the last 2 ourselves.  \n\nWe had a great time,  but after the other 4 said it was disappointing that they did very little towards the actual escape, and missed a lot of the story.   \n\nWhen there is a big skill differential those without it really get overwhelmed.", "Some people are really good at seeing the whole picture. I went with a group of friends to one of the larger escape rooms with multiple puzzles and we were running out of time and couldn\u2019t figure out what to do. At literally the last minute, one of the friends who wasn\u2019t really trying to help solve the puzzles, walks over to the exit, puts in the code, and walks out while we all stared at him in shock. \n\nI asked him how he was able to do that when he wasn\u2019t even completing the puzzles and he said he was able to look at what we were doing and figured out what each part was supposed to be (when we weren\u2019t able to solve the individual puzzles that would link together) and thought that it might lead to a code to input on this  thing attached to the wall near the exit, so he thought he would try it out and see if it would work and it did. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I've only done one, we worked d every puzzle as a group and got second pace on the board, we had a range of ages and capability, it's a team effort, sometimes ya have to step back and let others have a chance", "She doesn't seem like a good team player.", "So when she joins a group of people, either only she has fun by taking over, or only she doesn\u2019t have fun by having to slow down to everyone else\u2019s pace. It\u2019s either one person bored and the other five having fun, or one person having fun and the rest of the group bored. She\u2019s not more important, or even as important, as everyone else combined. If this were a group of people insisting on joining her on her usual activity, I could understand her reluctance to slow down for them, but in this case she really needs to suck it up and just enjoy the company of the group so she doesn\u2019t ruin everyone else\u2019s good time.", "This!! Best response I\u2019ve seen. OP just asked her to take a step back & let others have a turn, since that\u2019s what an escape room is about.

It's true that they're working together, but they're also fighting the clock.\n\nWatching the time count down while you know the answer silently waiting for your turn would be excruciating.", "does she not have her own friends?", "...or if she's good at solving them, she might also be good at creating them.", " I hate it when a clever person has constantly to play dumb to fit in. This is so often recommended to girls that it makes me sick.\n\nHowever, in this case, I can see the point of the group.\n\nShe is obviously several levels above the rest of the group, and it seems neither she, nor them have fun. It would perhaps be preferable for her to find a group at a better level.", ">She sort of slowed down and just helped us, but she gets it done really fast and seemed frustrated at how slow we were going. And we have done it with simultaneous puzzles, but she can usually do three or four in the time it takes us to do one or two, so **we'd be working on separate puzzles, but she'd finish hers, then come and do the rest of them herself.**\n\n\nFrom one of OP's comments. So it sounds like that's exactly what they do, but the girlfriend gets impatient when others don't solve their puzzles as fast as she does, and takes over. To me this is where she becomes the asshole. Just solving your own puzzles quickly is fine, and offering to help with others when you do so is also fine. But it's pretty lacking in social awareness to repeatedly take over puzzles from others when you've been informed that you're ruining their fun by doing so. If she can't scale herself back enough to make it enjoyable for everyone (even if that might mean not finishing the room) then she isn't suited for that specific group.", "She might just be smart.", "I would guess the friends just joke around a lot while doing it? And she just tries ro go straight for the exit?", "I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a wide variety out there. My general experience with difficult rooms is 20-30 puzzles in and hour and often times 8 or so at a time to be solved simultaneously. Usually you have to solve all of those to unlock something to move forward and get more puzzles so that causes everyone to regroup to catch up on the story", "I hope that he took his cool guys shades off as he left", "Well she did compromise: they got to do the first puzzles at their pace, then she did a few at hers. But ultimately it's just not a good match. However it would mean she doesn't get to do rooms woth her bf, which sucks", "Now let me put together for you the smaller pieces of this puzzle. You and your friends were upset because she was able to put together the puzzles quicker than you. So it became boring to you, plus you probably felt a little dumber that you couldn't keep up. So, your first answer was to reverse the roles. You asked her to sit back and let the rest of you solve the puzzles. Making it to where she was the one that was bored waiting for you to figure out what she had already pieced together. Then, when that didn't work, you resorted to uninviting her. Purposely excluding her from a group activity simply because she's better at it. You turned her into the only kid in class not invited to the party, and then wonder why she is  upset. \n\nIf you wish to be better at puzzles, you should learn how to view different perspectives.", "SHE is an autistic & ADHD woman that is really good at solving puzzles and ends up inadvertently doing the exact thing that OP's girlfriend does. \n\nAnd I said Neurodivergent not autistic. She could be, but this post gives ADHD. Hence my phrasing because rejection sensitivity is a thing. \n\n*FTFY", "I actually haven't done one of these before so I wasn't sure. I can see how that wouldn't really work. Just thought the gf might not really be \"getting it\" and that could be a way to try and spell it out for her, but sounds like at a certain point there's not much you can do if she literally can't play collaboratively.", "My friend started doing that,  and it is fantastic because she tries to slide clues in that only one in the group will know, and have a clue like that for everyone.    \n\nPart of the fun is finding which clue is your custom clue!", "For OP's friend group and that'd be a fun game for everyone. Kinda like DnD?", "She\u2019s the Marshal of the group", "You gotta split it and see who gets the cream!", "She should just tease her hair, show some cleavage and tell her BF how smart he is.", "Not my experience at all, we worked together and got 2nd on the board and we ranged from 11 to 72", "Some people just have their dicks out at all time when it comes to puzzle.

Either she solves them all - which isn\u2019t fun for him, or she dumbs herself down, which isn\u2019t fun for her \n\nIt\u2019s 100% a compatibility issue but she should recognize the situation and not get mad at OP for not finding a solution to an issue without one, that\u2019s where she kind of becomes an asshole", "Yeah I learnt a similar lesson as an early teenager.\n\nHanging back and chiming in with answers when everyone else has been stuck for a while is the way to go.

It's frustrating on her end, too, so I think the separate escape rooms might be a nice compromise especially if she's competitive.", "When you have a skill, it's not showing off. But when you advance beyond the others and they don't want to play with you, one can only either go off towards solitary pursuits or find a new group to play with that can challenge her. Not bad thing to do, making new acquaintances.", "Maybe she just gets excited and forgets to hang back. It can be hard to censor yourself or dumb yourself down without looking down on the people who can't keep up. She respects them, so it might be hard to remember she's supposed to stay silent like she would if she were babysitting some kids that aren't that good at puzzles. \n\nIt's NAH imo, too. It's rough to be outside the group by being either too slow or too fast, and obviously it's not fun to have her there making things boring for everyone else. It's fair that she's sad, but it's fair that they don't want her there, too.", "Escape rooms usually have lots of puzzles that different people can work on at the same time. That's why they are fun even with a group with various skill levels. I'm not sure why the group doesn't just take a divide and conquer approach instead of everyone working on one puzzle at a time.", "Then she shouldn\u2019t get mad they don\u2019t want get there and find a group to her level.", "That\u2019s not a good analogy because OP and his friends aren\u2019t terrible they just aren\u2019t as good as her. They still solve the puzzles. \n\nA better one would be:\nif you were on a basketball team and everyone took turns shooting, would you really have fun knowing not everyone scored immediately?", "well that depends if you were playing basketball because you wanted to compete or as a method of spending time with those people", "I haven\u2019t been to many escape rooms so I\u2019ll defer to someone with more knowledge, but it seems even in that case the main problem still wouldn\u2019t be solved though. OP\u2019s GF is much better than them. Whatever group she gets placed on would either have to let her solve them or she would have to dumb herself down \n\nThe only true solution is for everyone to work on their own puzzle, but that kind of ruins the point of it being a group activity", "That may be true but generally it is easier to work together on puzzles with smaller groups. It's easier to share ideas and it becomes more like a conversation. I think it could still potentially work.\n\nWith bigger groups working a puzzle, it's pretty normal that one person ends up taking the lead. Unfortunately it's hard for everyone to get an equal say, there just ends up being too many competing ideas.", "Well the issue is that they wouldn\u2019t be working together even in the small teams because she is better at outright solving the puzzles on her own", "Well all I'm saying that's not necessarily true. Two people with mismatched skills can totally cooperate and have fun solving a puzzle together. But it's much harder for 5 people to do the same.\n\nBut it's also possible OP's gf prefer to take control and do it all herself. In which case group size is not a factor.\n\nEdit: Added a bit more to my comment", "I understand what you\u2019re saying, but that doesn\u2019t apply in this case since she\u2019s able to figure them out *on her own* much faster than anyone else in the group. So the same would be true - she would either have to dumb herself down considerably or the other people wouldn\u2019t be able to contribute in a meaningful way. \n\nFor this to work you cannot have someone who is heads and shoulders better than the rest of the group. She is going to realize solutions well before anyone else, which takes the fun out"]}
