She may have become defensive and not realized that the real issue is that she is essentially hogging the entire experience, which is not cool no matter how good she is at it. \n\nCould you maybe offer her one more chance where you enforce taking turns in a rotation on the puzzles, if that is possible? If she is missing the social cues that tell her no one else is having fun standing around while she blows through every puzzle, she may need a more concrete direction like a turn order. And if she falls back into her old ways, you need to call her out on it in the moment and see if it gets through to her. \"Hey, Joe was in the middle of saying something, hear him out,\" \"Dave found that clue, let him have a shot figuring out where it goes,\" etc.\n\nThat being said, I know it kind of sucks that everyone else was able to work collaboratively before without a restriction like a turn order, but maybe give it one single shot more and see if everyone is able to enjoy themselves.

Good rooms usually have a few things going on, but I've seen plenty that are basically a linear series of puzzles. \n\n\nI'm more curious how there's such a skill gap, considering this whole group routinely plays together, and she's the new one. A whole room usually requires a lot of different skills. Solving riddles, jigsaw puzzles, math clues, word puzzles,  just noticing hidden objects, and so on.

Meaning socializing is part of it.", "It would be really hard to beat the harder rooms unless you divide and conquer. Also trying to have the whole group work on one puzzle really doesn\u2019t work well\u2014too many varying opinions. We\u2019ve always worked best splitting into 1-3 people per puzzle.

Being a know-it-all isn't fun for your friends. Ask me how I know, lol.\n\nMy impulse is always to give the answer first.

I feel like that works out rather well. \nOverall, the moments I cherish most are the one\u2019s where someone else understood something I didn\u2019t, typically where out of the box thinking is necessary instead of the usual logical, more straightforward thinking that is often needed. \nOh and maybe tell your gf to instead create her own escape puzzles, I had a lot of fun building a wooden box with locks and create puzzles and stuff and then watching my mom solve the puzzles and finally open the box.", "She doesn't have the same goals as the rest of the group, so she doesn't need to go with the rest of the group. Take her to an escape room on her own, or do something else with her, where she can take the lead.\n\nNTA.", "So I started playing Terraria with my kids, 18m and 10m. 18m doesn't live with us, and had some school stuff going on (sports, grades, work, you name it) and didn't join us for a couple months, but 10m and I continued playing.\n\n10m and I got to know the game systems, memorized what we'd need to fast start, shortcuts to get better gear, etc. So when 18m rejoined us, even when we created a fresh world, he was completely out of his league. This was obviously not intentional, and I made a point of not twinking him or running ahead of him so much, but 10m is 10, and he just blasted ahead to the next thing as fast as he could so he could summon the next boss because boss fights are his favorite part. 18m got a little butthurt about it, and we had to move on to another game. I mean I was glad in a way, because it gave me a chance to point out the issues to 10m, hoping he'll learn something about playing nice, so to speak.\n\nBut there's no question in my mind that your GF is basically my 10 yr old writ older, OP. If she refuses to hold back, you basically have no choice but to pick her or your friends.

Instead of allowing everyone a chance to shine, she's selfishly making it about her own abilities.

So it sounds like that's exactly what they do, but the girlfriend gets impatient when others don't solve their puzzles as fast as she does, and takes over. To me this is where she becomes the asshole. Just solving your own puzzles quickly is fine, and offering to help with others when you do so is also fine. But it's pretty lacking in social awareness to repeatedly take over puzzles from others when you've been informed that you're ruining their fun by doing so. If she can't scale herself back enough to make it enjoyable for everyone (even if that might mean not finishing the room) then she isn't suited for that specific group.", "She might just be smart.", "I would guess the friends just joke around a lot while doing it?

You and your friends were upset because she was able to put together the puzzles quicker than you. So it became boring to you, plus you probably felt a little dumber that you couldn't keep up. So, your first answer was to reverse the roles. You asked her to sit back and let the rest of you solve the puzzles. Making it to where she was the one that was bored waiting for you to figure out what she had already pieced together. Then, when that didn't work, you resorted to uninviting her. Purposely excluding her from a group activity simply because she's better at it.

It's easier to share ideas and it becomes more like a conversation.

Not to mention being mad and upset over not being invited could be rsd which is common in people with adhd where we are very sensitive to criticism or rejection and this would feel like being rejected and saying your not good enough or whatever for us or you and that would hurt and usually getting angry is easier than being upset. Obviously I\u2019m not a doctor but I do have adhd and possibly autism ( not sure on that yet). \nSo is it possible that she has undiagnosed adhd or something like that? It goes undiagnosed in women more than men due to the fact that women tend to have the inattentive type of adhd which doesn\u2019t have all the hyperactive symptoms it\u2019s mostly internal symptoms. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t then she is just being either  very sensitive and oblivious or she\u2019s being manipulative by being mad when you should be the one being mad or upset.\n\nHonestly I think what is needed is to sit down and talk I mean when you first talked did you even ask her why she was solving them alone or did you just tell her to slow down and help a bit? Cause that\u2019s also a bit of an issue because she did do that for her technically but then she took over again I don\u2019t know if that was intentional or accidental I mean if it was accidental then maybe you and her could go with one or two friends who maybe are more patient and she just needs to be shown or told what you want and maybe oractice.

If she's smarter than her bf, what will his friends think? Will she start wondering why she isn't with someone more her speed?\n\nI've had a bf tell me, \"I don't care if you're smarter, but could you act stupider around my friends?\" Trust me, respect for bf fell off a cliff and died of embarrassment before hitting the ground.

Specifics help the world make more sense and become more manageable when you don't seem to naturally understand things other people seem to. \n\nDuring the rest of the time, maybe watch and see which parts of the puzzle each person is best at.

This is just based on my personal experience and how I know I can be when I\u2019m excited or hyper focused and how most women don\u2019t get diagnosed because it\u2019s internal.

I also asked about how he went about the first talk because maybe she just didn\u2019t understand me fully based on how he explained it to her.

I do get why your friends don't want your GF to come along to future escape rooms, but I also don't think she's being an AH - she's obviously trying to do something differently; she just hasn't gotten it right yet.  And I kind of think you would be crossing into AH territory if they refuse to have her along (but other GFs are coming; it would be different if they decided it was just always going to be the guys), she wants to go and is upset about it, and you keep going with them (and the other GFs) regularly anyway.\n\nI'm finding this discussion really interesting...\n\nI can really relate to why it's hard for your GF to find the right way to participate in that kind of situation. TBH I was usually the \"smart one\" who (in retrospect, though, I don't think I realized it at the time) was too fast/oblivious to stuff like this, and I wish I had had somebody in my life who could have helped me see it more clearly and understand more clearly how to integrate myself into a mixed-level group to make it more fun for everybody, including myself, instead of just alternating between being too assertive or holding back too much. It really wasn't until first, I had kids and learned how to hold back so they could shine; and then in my 40s, started taking some leadership workshops that I started to discover some strategies for approaching these kinds of situations. \n\nYou would be giving your GF a gift if you keep thinking about this, working on it,  helping her see how other people are seeing her - from a place of loving kindness, not criticism. But maybe you could also throw some mad props her way for being so good at the escape room, instead of just criticizing her for being too good at it.\n\nBTW, as a side note, I've noticed that people (especially men) often get annoyed at people (essentially women) who are smarter / mentally faster than the group.- but those same people don't seem to mind or notice in a more physical game when some people are physically stronger/ faster than the group and they totally dominate the game. In the latter case, the same people who want the smart girls to sit out of the escape room are perfectly happy to make the weaker/slower girls sit on the sidelines / bench because they're no good in the volleyball game or whatever. I don't know if this is true of your friends, but it might be interesting to pay attention and notice if there are some asymmetries there.", "No.\nShe is just wired differently that you and your friends, perhaps hoing just with her in occasion, you do seek to love her and should tey to make her happy . But this goes both ways, she needa to understand that other people matter too.", "Nta. She is ruining the fun\u2014-she is not trying to be in a group activity.

I'd honestly like to hear her side of the story here-- I'd you guys regularly finish escape Rooms, how different are her skills to take it over? Is this a problem with assertiveness differences?", "ETA. honestly, she should've respected your request and its shitty that she didn't. But I also find it fucking funny how you guys can't find out to work with her either? Like did none of you ask her what she's doing? If she can go slower and talk with the group about her findings?

She may very well be better at it, but it\u2019s supposed to be a team effort. It\u2019s no different than a ball hog in basketball.

We all had fun and I recognized a da Vinci code device. I bullshitted the story of the history of it while I told them how it works and the others figured out the code that went into it.\n\nI didn\u2019t just take over and everyone had fun. I did make a really bad joke when we got told to imitate a clock though. I imitated a vintage alarm clock \u23f0 and yelled \u201cringringringringring!\u201d At the top of my lungs.", "Also don't they run out of rooms if they go this often?", "The solution is pretty simple and basic. You just tone it down. There is no reason to be an asshole and prove your superiority every time. I can fling my dog across the room during tug of war but that would only show that I'm an asshole who can't play well with others.", "Tbh I think that it's more so other people's partners get included in it and she's not. I could understand how that would upset someone. I think in the future they should make it a \"no partners\" thing", "The one chance kind of struck me too. She also did what she was asked \u2014 OP asked her to sit back and let the group solve some of the puzzles. I think there needs to be a second chance with more communication on what exactly they want her to do if what they originally asked for isn\u2019t good enough.", "So you're asking OP to be a douche to prove a point. That is just dumb.", "Maybe consider escape room boxes or murder mystery boxes? If she's that good at puzzles and enjoys solving them with other people and wants to participate in your friends group, doing a type of puzzle with everyone that requires less collective monetary investment might be a good alternative to an expensive escape room. And yall can keep filling her some glasses of wine to slow her down, or just specifically be able to say \"hey xyz is reading the clue right now, give them a moment with it,\" much easier than if you're in a rented room with a time limit. A box that you can all take your time with (i know they can have time limits too, but you can also ignore then) where she can read the clues last to give everyone else a head start might be a good alternative. Practicing not taking over the puzzles in circumstances without time limits may also help her gain the skill at stepping back to join in escape Rooms later.", "Honestly, if you reversed the genders, my group would have probably booted her first game.", "It\u2019s a bit confusing though, because she actually did do what OP asked. She was told to \u201csit back and let the rest of us solve some of the puzzles too\u201d.  If I was given this instruction, I would assume I was still welcome to solve some too. OP should communicate what they actually want her to do, I.e. \u201cgive us occasional hints but not answers\u201d or something.", "This is my take exactly.

Here's a suggestion: why don't you go to a couple of escape rooms with just the two of you, and tell her that you really want to figure out a way to do them together so that it's fun for both of you. Tell her that if she figures out a puzzle before you, instead of actually solving it, she should give you a hint. Then you can kind of work your way through the escape room, giving each other feedback about when you're frustrated, when you want more hints, when you maybe want to skip ahead or work separately. That way she can learn some of this stuff in a little bit safer context / smaller group; the two of you can improve your relationship and communication skills (in a way that's likely to be useful in the real world if you stay together, not just in an escape room); and maybe she'll develop some patterns that will be useful for you, her if someday she rejoins the larger group.\n\nEscape rooms are often used for team building in corporate and school contexts, but it works best when there's somebody coaching the team effort and not just throwing the team into the deep end, Lord of the Flies style ..\n\nGood luck with all of it. I think it's really nice that you're being so productive and thoughtful about how to approach this. I hope you'll keep working on it instead of just shutting the door on her being part of this aspect of your life.", "If that's bizarre to you then why can't you see it from the others perspective of expecting others to sit there whilst someone else just solves the problems and not even given a chance. They're effectively sitting there twiddling their thumbs too because she can't help herself.\n\nShe may be quick to solve puzzles but she has a lot to learn in terms of working with a group, how smart can you be if you're incapable of adapting?\n\nIt's boring for her to wait, it's boring for them watching one person play, they're not compatible she can't fix her problem and they can't solve it as quick as her.\n\nI'm sure she would be upset if someone solved the puzzles faster than her rendering her input useless as well.", "In the same vein, Puzzles Mcgee is paying $35 to get frustrated watching their friends struggle with a puzzle they could solve, which isn't fun either.

Its how play makes us better at various things and more sociable.", "There is a principle in education called \"social constructivism\".  I think it was Vygotsky who  discueed it a lot.\n\nIt is the concept that learning from peers is effective, and sometimes more effective than learning from a teacher.  By moderating the environment so that the difficulty level is just right, and by having peers who play at a level just above another person's level, there can be very rewarding educational experiences.\n\nYou can witness it at kindergardens.  All of the kids will be using the same tool in the same way, and then one kid finds a new way.  Soon after, the other kids start using the same way. It only works if they are working within their zone of proximal development.\n\nAnother example would be playing with your own children.  If a kid is making things with blocks, you should play just at, and just above their level.  From this, they can see new ways of building or playing, and gradually accommodate them.  If an adult instead thinks, \"I will show off my skills and make the best thing I am capable of\", then the kid will learn nothing and will lose confidence, and that adult will not be a good play partner or teacher for their child.", "Chess is rated, and people usually play people just at, or just below their level, and within their zone of proximal development.

It was really fun for all of us (and in fact, the least skilled group member has mentioned to me multiple times since then what a great time she had and how much fun it was to do the puzzle room with me) - but only because I had worked so hard (over MANY years) to develop my skills of being a kind of dungeon master while also being part of the group.
