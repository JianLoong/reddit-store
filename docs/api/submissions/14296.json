She may have become defensive and not realized that the real issue is that she is essentially hogging the entire experience, which is not cool no matter how good she is at it. \n\nCould you maybe offer her one more chance where you enforce taking turns in a rotation on the puzzles, if that is possible? If she is missing the social cues that tell her no one else is having fun standing around while she blows through every puzzle, she may need a more concrete direction like a turn order. And if she falls back into her old ways, you need to call her out on it in the moment and see if it gets through to her. \"Hey, Joe was in the middle of saying something, hear him out,\" \"Dave found that clue, let him have a shot figuring out where it goes,\" etc.\n\nThat being said, I know it kind of sucks that everyone else was able to work collaboratively before without a restriction like a turn order, but maybe give it one single shot more and see if everyone is able to enjoy themselves.

Good rooms usually have a few things going on, but I've seen plenty that are basically a linear series of puzzles. \n\n\nI'm more curious how there's such a skill gap, considering this whole group routinely plays together, and she's the new one. A whole room usually requires a lot of different skills. Solving riddles, jigsaw puzzles, math clues, word puzzles,  just noticing hidden objects, and so on.

Also trying to have the whole group work on one puzzle really doesn\u2019t work well\u2014too many varying opinions. We\u2019ve always worked best splitting into 1-3 people per puzzle.

Being a know-it-all isn't fun for your friends. Ask me how I know, lol.\n\nMy impulse is always to give the answer first. I don't really do escape rooms, and trivia things usually aren't geared towards my interests.
