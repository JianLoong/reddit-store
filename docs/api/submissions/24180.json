But my coworker at the start of her shift puts gloves on and does everything with them, she touches money, packs bread touches the POS system, then touches the breads and other items with theses contaminated gloves and doesn\u2019t use the tissues. Nobody is allowed to do this at my work, but no one seems to call her out for this people see her do it and want to say something but don\u2019t, as she was serving this guy he hands her cash she uses her gloves to touch the money and get change, she then comes over to the table and starts to pack cheese and bacon rolls with theses gloves she has been wearing for 4 hours and just touched money with. As i saw this I lost it  in my head thinking what the fuck is wrong with her! I nicely say \u201c hey not trying to be mean or anything but we can\u2019t be using gloves that you just touched money with and then go and pack that is so dirty and gross\u201d. She rolled her eyes and just stopped and looked at me angry because I just called her out. She then says to me \u201c firstly don\u2019t tell me what to do I\u2019ve been working her for longer and secondly I never touched money with theses gloves\u201d I responded \u201c I literally just say you serve that man and take money from him\u201d she replies with \u201c okay fine mabye I did I\u2019ll go and change them if it\u2019s such a big deal\u201d rolling her eye as she changed her gloves.

I used to work in a hospital in food service so being clean and learning about cross contamination and food borne illnesses was taught and taken seriously.

They would come back from break and just go back to work\u2026.like seriously, for all I know they could have picked their nose or gone to the bathroom and not washed their hands. So yeah I was a bitch always asking if they washed their hands. It was like working with 2 yr olds. I actually got into a fight with the store manager who refused to give me bleach after someone cut themselves on a sliver. I actually had to get my phone out and looked up how to safely clean up blood as a diluted solution of bleach is an acceptable way to kill blood pathogens. I worked at the hospital for 29 yrs so I knew what I was talking about! The next day after they talked to corporate they issued a memo about how to use bleach after anyone gets cut on a slicer. You just know that that manager was trying to prove me wrong, but after they spoke to the health department, suddenly I was right. \n\nAny time you catch your nasty coworker not changing her gloves or doing other nasty stuff like coughing into her hands, touching her hair or face or chewing gum (yes i caught all of this while working) call her out and loudly.
