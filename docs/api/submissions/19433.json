Do not concede or offer to buy a new one; NTA\u2014 kids needs to learn consequences.

You watched four 5&6 year old kids for long enough for everyone  else to have their idea of fun.\n\nNo one died apparently.\nI think she should count this as a win, to maybe be inspired to reassess her parenting style.\n\nIf you are going to give a kindergartener a new $1000 computer to take on vacation, what\u2019s left for high school graduation?\nOr 1st grade?\nNta.", " I really want to N T A, but seriously, you thought the phone could be a pool toy?\n\nI'm going to go ESH.\n\nYou for letting them use the phone, waterproof case or not, as a pool toy.

I don't believe an iphone broke though, I think this is all a terribly bad lie that takes the audience for fools.", "ESH, your sister should of been smarter, but same to you, waterproof does not equal throw proof.
