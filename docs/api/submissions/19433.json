I'm not sure why there are so many NTA posts.~~\n\nEdit: I just saw a comment that OP is only 17. In light of this, I am changing my vote to NTA. It was completely unreasonable to expect a teenager to recognize that the case is not 100% waterproof, and since their sister claimed it was and shrugged off any concern, of course OP is going to not be concerned about it. Furthermore, an iPhone is an expensive purchase for a 17 yo! Those parents are the irresponsible ones and they should pay for a new phone if their child needs one.\n\nI will leave my original comment for posterity:\n\nFirst, why in the world would your sister give a six year old a phone, much less than a brand new iPhone 14?! Kids are notoriously irresponsible, and that thing was bound to break or be lost one way or another. Also, what does a 6 year old need with a phone? Are they not always with an adult who has a phone for emergencies? Are they going out on the town?\n\nSecond, by simply shrugging off the idea of being careful about water, your sister was giving the impression to her kid that it was ok to throw caution to the wind with their phone altogether, at least with respect to the water risk.\n\nThat being said, use some common sense! Even if the phone were completely waterproof, throwing it up in the air is risky on a whole other level, since it could so easily have hit the side of the pool or the ground around the pool and cracked! Especially given how fragile iPhones are. Also, just being a rational adult with real-world experience, you should have been aware that no phone case is 100% water-proof and that repeatedly throwing the phone in the pool was bound to end in disaster.\n\nI'm sure that what your sister was thinking when she shrugged off the water risk was that her kid would maybe have their phone at the side of the pool, or that they might wade in the water with it. It was a very optimistic (and foolish) expectation for a child. She should have talked to her child about phone responsibility when she made the (terrible) decision to give them a phone in the first place.\n\nDo I think you should cover the cost of a new phone? No. Frankly, I think that kid has shown themself to be too immature to have a phone. But you were the adult, and you failed to be responsible.", "Is this even real?", "You let them repeatedly throw the phone like it was a toy? The repeated impact of the phone hitting the water/bottom of the pool could have messed with the phone case\u2019s integrity. Also what if they threw it and it hit the edge of the pool or the pavement and broke that way? Would you think you were responsible for it being broken then? Or would it be your sisters fault for not explicitly telling you to not let the kids throw the phone?\nyou were the adult in charge, why wouldn\u2019t you suggest they play this game with something else.\n\nI don\u2019t think you or your sister are true assholes, you both just made dumb decisions. Your sister for buying a kid such an expensive phone without great insurance. And you for letting children throw around a phone. The thing is your stupidity was so immense in that moment plus you\u2019re trying to completely pass blame on your sister it makes you the asshole. YTA/maybe ESH.\n\nIdk wtf is up with everyone in these comments acting like it\u2019s perfectly reasonable you allowed children in your care to treat a breakable electronic like a football.
