She is an officer in the US military and is currently overseas on deployment.  It can be hard for me sometimes to basically be a single parent, but I love my wife and I love my kids and I'm proud of my wife's service.  But that aspect of our lives isn't the topic here.\n\nMy wife's parents live across the country, like 2,000 miles away.  I don't have a great relationship with them and really only see them when my wife is in the states.  They aren't necessarily bad people by any means and I know they love their grandkids, I just don't enjoy their company and don't want to hang out with them or talk with them if I don't have to.\n\nDue to my wife's deployment, we were unable to spend the holidays with her this past year.  Instead, I took a week off of work and I took the kids to visit my parents for Xmas and New Year's.  It was a fun week and it was a nice change to our day-to-day routine.  It also gave me a much needed chance to be off full-time kid duty for a few days.\n\nMy mom posted a lot of pictures of our stay on social media, which my MIL saw.  MIL then decided to call me and tell me that they would also like to see their grandkids since it has been a long time.  She's not wrong, they haven't seen my kids in 3 years.  I told her I would have to think about it and talk with my wife first.  But since I don't always get regular communication with my wife, I don't know exactly when that will be.\n\nWhen I finally talked with my wife, I mentioned her mom asking to see the kids.  Apparently, MIL had contacted my wife about it as well.  I told my wife that I would prefer to wait until she gets back from deployment and she agreed.  She said she would talk to her mom about it next chance she gets.\n\nA few days later, MIL calls again.  She said she talked with my wife and she understands that we just took time to see my parents over the holidays, so she offered to come visit us instead of us going to them.  I told her, I appreciate the idea, but that isn't going to work for us.  She tried to tell me that it would give me a break and that she and FIL could help around the house so that it isn't all on me.\n\nI told her that even if I let them come see the kids, they wouldn't be staying with us and would have to get a hotel.  I then said that I already talked with her daughter and we both agreed that waiting until she is back from deployment is for the best, but that even then I can't guarantee when it will happen.\n\nShe got upset with me for \"making it nearly impossible for them to see their grandkids\" when I just took them to see my parents for nearly 2 weeks and they haven't seen them in 3 years.  I pretty much told her that it isn't my problem and if she wants to take it up with someone, she can talk to her daughter or the US military and see if she can get her daughter's deployment time reduced.  I told her good luck with getting either one to budge on their current stance.\n\nEDIT:  This is a comment that I was advised to add to my post regarding my relationship with my in-laws:\n\n We just don't see eye to eye on pretty much anything. MIL is convinced that I am incapable of raising my kids \"without their mother\" and has told me on numerous occasions that because my wife is deployed for long periods of time, that \"the kids need a mother's touch\" that I cannot possibly provide. FIL is also convinced that my wife \"settled\" for me and has told me on more than one occasion that he wishes my wife had stayed with her previous BF who was also military and who cheated on her numerous times.

Yes, having two sets of grandparents is great, but if one of those sets is toxic, it's okay to let them go.\n\nHOWEVER, it's unclear to me why your response needed to be quite so hostile and maybe there's just some vital information missing about what your in-laws did or didn't do to you or your wife in the past. Do you expect to never engage with them again? Would you prefer your kids not spend alone time with them? It's perfectly fine to go NC if that's what's best for your family, but if you think they're going to stay in your life, is there some way to let them in a little through some sort of reasonable compromise? Can you FaceTime?\n\nIf you want to repair the relationship, you can just be honest about your misgivings. Say something like, \"I'm sorry I got so heated when we last talked. I'm just very in my groove with the kids since your daughter's been away and, as you know, you and I have never really gelled. I do want the kids to be able to know you, but I need XYZ to feel comfortable first.\" with XYZ being whatever your boundaries are (like, staying in a hotel while they're there or whatever.)\n\nI guess the big question is what your wife would want you to do moving forward because she should get to direct how much contact her folks have to her kids. Good luck! I hope this extra stress in the middle of an already stressful era of your life (small kids, wife far away in a potentially threatening situation) resolves peacefully.", "Children are AWESOME when you want to control the people who love them.", "NTA because your wife is in agreement \n\n\nYour wife knows her parents best. If she is also wanting or is ok with having them wait until she is back for them to be around her children, that is very telling. \n\nPeople who have good relationships with good parents don\u2019t understand bad/neutral relationships with bad parents, which is why some folks are saying you are an a hole. \n\nIf they were good grandparents, good parents to your wife, your wife would be ok with them coming without her being there. She knows them best. Follow her lead.", "NTA because I saw your comment below on how they treat you and what they\u2019ve said to you and your wife. If they don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good father or can\u2019t raise the kids without their mom, then I have no doubt it would be miserable with them there. You need your wife as a buffer so they don\u2019t undermine you.", "Going against the grain here and going to say NTA. \n\nIt is exhausting being the parent holding down the fort while your spouse is deployed. My husband is gone right now. I get it (to a point - I only have one kid). \n\nEven though the in laws are family, they\u2019re guests. They\u2019re extra work. They\u2019re people to entertain, and you\u2019ve got two little people to entertain already. Furthermore, it\u2019s no coincidence it\u2019s been three years. COVID is partially responsible, but if your wife wanted your in laws more involved, they would be. There\u2019s a reason they haven\u2019t been to visit since travel restrictions lifted and before your wife left. And, assuming here, they\u2019re only jealous your parents got to see the kids.

I realize it's not the same as in person but it would at least give your children a chance to interact with their other grandparents.", "Yeah YTA\n\nRemember this when your kids start having kids and their SO doesn't want you to see them...", "Ok. Still YTA then. You're acting very selfishly.", "Your kids are the buffer? They probably don\u2019t want to see you any more than you want to see them, if it makes you feel any better! But denying your kids a relationship with people who love them is selfish.", "Look.  I despised my mother-in-law almost from the first day I met her.  She tried to get her son to dump me, and that's only one reason.  But when I married her son, and when I had her grandchildren, that didn't matter.  She was still his mother and she was their grandmother.  I didn't wail about needing \"a buffer\".", "You still haven\u2019t given a single reason why you don\u2019t want to see them other than not enjoying their company.", "You wouldn\u2019t even have to. Make it a long weekend for them at the hotel and you get a few days free.", "Why?", "Grow up", "You do realize you\u2019re hurting your kids by keeping them from people who want to spend time and bond with them. YTA grow up and let them see the kids jfc you sound like a little boy", "All they have to do is take you to court for grandparent visitation rights and then what? Try and tell the judge well I just don't like them. Too bad so sad. You're the AH op.", "Why don't you let them take the kids the next time they are out of school for more than just the weekend? Like maybe spring break they could spend with their grandparents. Your not dealing with the IL for any length of time and they get to spend time with their grandparents. Not offering any compromise makes you TAH.", "You poor baby, get over yourself and grow up", "And that\u2019s great for you! That that is what you would do! How wonderful, for YOU. That\u2019s not what OP or his wife want.", "Um. They could NOT tell him he's not a good enough parent or husband and then expect him to want them around.", ">What extra effort can they put in?\n\nWait a few months until my wife gets back.", "\"I told her that even if I let them come see the kids, they wouldn't be staying with us and would have to get a hotel. I then said that I already talked with her daughter and we both agreed that waiting until she is back from deployment is for the best, but that even then I can't guarantee when it will happen.\"\n\nNo, he's pretty clear that it's staying in a hotel while his wife is deployed. And his wife, their daughter, agrees that it would be better to wait for her return before they visit.", "Exactly, OP didn\u2019t really offer them the hotel as an option. He just doesn\u2019t want them to come at all.", "I'm assuming there's a good reason why their daughter hasn't made their relationship a priority, but I didn't want to get too far into speculating. It definitely sounds like more than just OP's stubborn unwillingness to accommodate them.", "Because they are the only ones wanting this to happen. It is not mutually beneficial, and hosting two people for a week is not effortless", "The post made it sound like there was the option for them to stay in a hotel while they visited. I don't see the problem with that.", "If they\u2019d pay for it. It\u2019s a sacrifice from you but still kinda an idea. It\u2019s uncomfortable to have people in your home but atleast they want to make the effort. I feel the same about my in laws don\u2019t really care to be around them but if they made the effort I would let them.", "Yes I thought about that, but its because he doesnt care for his IL. She cant fight that battle being deployed.", "Ah right makes sense. It\u2019s your life, so NTA, but try putting yourself in their shoes and think how it would be when you kids are older with kids you couldn\u2019t see for 3 years. Hopefully your wife is back soon to make it easier for everyone.", "Or, and hear me out here, don't post a AITA and then have snarky comments when ppl say YTA", "If you\u2019re not gonna listen to literally everyone telling you you\u2019re the asshole, why\u2019d you post? To try and validate your own feelings? Cause that\u2019s not gonna happen.", "I don\u2019t think so. Travel has been back to normal for 18mos or so. Airlines don\u2019t even require masking anymore. \n\nSounds like a convenient excuse.", "Probably referring to \"grandparent's rights.\"  Laws vary drastically from state-to-state and I'm not sure what my state's views are on it.  But even then, my wife and I deciding as a couple to wait until she gets home from deployment to see her parents would not be grounds to sue, that's ridiculous.", "> I get that, by why weren\u2019t plans made after vaccines became available?\n\nI haven't talked to my in-laws about this personally, but if MIL's Facebook feed is any insight into her views on the vaccine, I don't think they got it.", "Y\u2019all forgot we just went thru a pandemic? Totally makes sense why they haven\u2019t seen their grandkids in 3 years", "I guess you'd have to ask my wife, she'll be back in the states in 4-8 months.", "That\u2019s really not how grandparent rights work.", "Grandparent visitation rights are usually only granted to grandparents that have had a heavy hand in raising the children. You can\u2019t just declare grandparent rights for access to grandchildren.", "Pretty sure there's a vanishingly slim chance at grandparent rights in a case where the kids have two healthy living parents.", "Oh ok.  \n\n\nYTA.", "And when you're a parent, you aren't just making a decision for yourself. These kids are being denied a relationship with their grandparents. The question should be - is it beneficial for them?", "And the OP didn't say they said no to that. He told them IF I let you see your grandkids, then you'll stay at hotel. It's the OP putting the blocker on that, not the GPs.", "I will never understand why people post here if they are so sure they\u2019re not in the wrong and all they want to do is convince everyone else. Jesus Christ. YTA anyway, but doubly so for your replies, which are snarky, defensive, and arrogant.", "My wife and I agreed on a boundary as a couple.  I am not going to allow my MIL to steamroll me into agreeing to something I don't want to do.  They can wait until my wife returns home.", "Yes yes yes. Funny how people ask question when they don't really want to hear the opinions that they are the ass", "That in itself would be a good enough reason for me to say no to seeing my kids.", "Then I\u2019d say they have missed out on years of seeing their grandkids because of their own decisions.\n\n1. They could have come after vaccines were readily available, but chose not to. \n2. They could have arranged a visit after the children were eligible for vaccines, but didn\u2019t bother. \n3. They could come now and stay in a hotel, but they don\u2019t feel like it. \n\nNTA how many chances do they need?", "You don\u2019t know the relationship your wife has with her parents?", "You do realize reddit works outside the USA, right?", "Yet the grandparents can, and actively prove that OP is intentionally with holding the kids when the wife is not around, and also believe op is not taking good care of the children. Therefore the grandparents would have a very viable and legal case against OP. All OP can literally rebuttal with in the court is, \"well they don't like me for no reason. So I'm keeping my kids from them as long as my wife is gone but my parents have full unlimited access to them.\"", "They are really young and probably barely remember their grandparents. It would be much better for them if the wife was there too, so they don't just see them as strangers Daddy barely tolerates.", "Which is fine and is your choice. But it does make you an asshole. Be a grown up and tolerate them for the sake of your children. Unless they are terrible grandparents or your wife thinks having them around her kids without her there is unsafe or wrong in some way.", "Then why are you on here asking if you\u2019re the asshole?", "Then I guess you don\u2019t need any advice here!", "You sound like an immature little brat tbh", "Why bother asking then?  If you don\u2019t care that you\u2019re the AH then why bother asking a bunch of strangers.", "Then why are you here? You asked if you were being an asshole. General consensus seems to be you are being a huge asshole. But clearly you want to continue to be an AH so why bother asking if you had no intentions of changing your behavior based on the verdict?", "it\u2019s none if your business lol", "I don't know exactly how she would describe it, which is what you asked.", "It doesn't matter if they remember them or not. In fact, that's even more of a reason to give them a relationship of some kind. And what would be much better if Daddy manned-up and acted like an adult in front of his children so they can establish a relationship with their family.", "If you\u2019re so sure you\u2019re not the asshole \n\n\nWhy are you bothering to post?", "Or the grandparents can wait till summer, and visit when mommy is back, so the kids get introduced to their grandparents by someone who actually likes those visitors. \n\nDo you really think toddlers cannot pick up a strong dislike from their primary caregiver? Without someone reassuring in the mix, having two complete strangers disturbing the routine will be terrifying to them, even if Dad does suck it up", "Do you really think it'll be summer? No. The wife will get back and not want visitors there as soon as she's home. \n\nAnd omg 6 & 4 aren't toddlers! My mom hated my grandmother and guess what? When I was that age, I loved my grandmother. Didn't matter what my mom felt about her. And \"terrifying\"? Wow that's a stretch there.", "But you knew your grandmother, and did not meet her the first time with the only other adults present obviously disliking them. The mood will be tense if they have to stay at their place, that is why OP suggested a hotel, which they refused. \n\n If she doesn't want her own parents around, can you really blame OP? She will most likely be home for longer than a week, so make them visit after she is a bit settled in", "You assume a lot. I didn\u2019t know her until I was 4 almost 5. \n\nShe visits her parents when she\u2019s home and brings her kids. OP never said the mom doesn\u2019t want her parents around or not to have the kids around them."]}
