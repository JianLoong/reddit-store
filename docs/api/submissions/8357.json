She is an officer in the US military and is currently overseas on deployment.  It can be hard for me sometimes to basically be a single parent, but I love my wife and I love my kids and I'm proud of my wife's service.  But that aspect of our lives isn't the topic here.\n\nMy wife's parents live across the country, like 2,000 miles away.  I don't have a great relationship with them and really only see them when my wife is in the states.  They aren't necessarily bad people by any means and I know they love their grandkids, I just don't enjoy their company and don't want to hang out with them or talk with them if I don't have to.\n\nDue to my wife's deployment, we were unable to spend the holidays with her this past year.  Instead, I took a week off of work and I took the kids to visit my parents for Xmas and New Year's.  It was a fun week and it was a nice change to our day-to-day routine.  It also gave me a much needed chance to be off full-time kid duty for a few days.\n\nMy mom posted a lot of pictures of our stay on social media, which my MIL saw.  MIL then decided to call me and tell me that they would also like to see their grandkids since it has been a long time.  She's not wrong, they haven't seen my kids in 3 years.  I told her I would have to think about it and talk with my wife first.  But since I don't always get regular communication with my wife, I don't know exactly when that will be.\n\nWhen I finally talked with my wife, I mentioned her mom asking to see the kids.  Apparently, MIL had contacted my wife about it as well.  I told my wife that I would prefer to wait until she gets back from deployment and she agreed.  She said she would talk to her mom about it next chance she gets.\n\nA few days later, MIL calls again.  She said she talked with my wife and she understands that we just took time to see my parents over the holidays, so she offered to come visit us instead of us going to them.  I told her, I appreciate the idea, but that isn't going to work for us.  She tried to tell me that it would give me a break and that she and FIL could help around the house so that it isn't all on me.\n\nI told her that even if I let them come see the kids, they wouldn't be staying with us and would have to get a hotel.  I then said that I already talked with her daughter and we both agreed that waiting until she is back from deployment is for the best, but that even then I can't guarantee when it will happen.\n\nShe got upset with me for \"making it nearly impossible for them to see their grandkids\" when I just took them to see my parents for nearly 2 weeks and they haven't seen them in 3 years.  I pretty much told her that it isn't my problem and if she wants to take it up with someone, she can talk to her daughter or the US military and see if she can get her daughter's deployment time reduced.  I told her good luck with getting either one to budge on their current stance.\n\nEDIT:  This is a comment that I was advised to add to my post regarding my relationship with my in-laws:\n\n We just don't see eye to eye on pretty much anything. MIL is convinced that I am incapable of raising my kids \"without their mother\" and has told me on numerous occasions that because my wife is deployed for long periods of time, that \"the kids need a mother's touch\" that I cannot possibly provide. FIL is also convinced that my wife \"settled\" for me and has told me on more than one occasion that he wishes my wife had stayed with her previous BF who was also military and who cheated on her numerous times. So yeah, not my favorite people to be around.

Yes, having two sets of grandparents is great, but if one of those sets is toxic, it's okay to let them go.\n\nHOWEVER, it's unclear to me why your response needed to be quite so hostile and maybe there's just some vital information missing about what your in-laws did or didn't do to you or your wife in the past. Do you expect to never engage with them again? Would you prefer your kids not spend alone time with them? It's perfectly fine to go NC if that's what's best for your family, but if you think they're going to stay in your life, is there some way to let them in a little through some sort of reasonable compromise? Can you FaceTime?\n\nIf you want to repair the relationship, you can just be honest about your misgivings. Say something like, \"I'm sorry I got so heated when we last talked. I'm just very in my groove with the kids since your daughter's been away and, as you know, you and I have never really gelled. I do want the kids to be able to know you, but I need XYZ to feel comfortable first.\" with XYZ being whatever your boundaries are (like, staying in a hotel while they're there or whatever.)\n\nI guess the big question is what your wife would want you to do moving forward because she should get to direct how much contact her folks have to her kids. Good luck!

If she is also wanting or is ok with having them wait until she is back for them to be around her children, that is very telling. \n\nPeople who have good relationships with good parents don\u2019t understand bad/neutral relationships with bad parents, which is why some folks are saying you are an a hole. \n\nIf they were good grandparents, good parents to your wife, your wife would be ok with them coming without her being there. She knows them best. Follow her lead.", "NTA because I saw your comment below on how they treat you and what they\u2019ve said to you and your wife. If they don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good father or can\u2019t raise the kids without their mom, then I have no doubt it would be miserable with them there. You need your wife as a buffer so they don\u2019t undermine you.", "Going against the grain here and going to say NTA. \n\nIt is exhausting being the parent holding down the fort while your spouse is deployed. My husband is gone right now. I get it (to a point - I only have one kid). \n\nEven though the in laws are family, they\u2019re guests. They\u2019re extra work. They\u2019re people to entertain, and you\u2019ve got two little people to entertain already. Furthermore, it\u2019s no coincidence it\u2019s been three years. COVID is partially responsible, but if your wife wanted your in laws more involved, they would be. There\u2019s a reason they haven\u2019t been to visit since travel restrictions lifted and before your wife left. And, assuming here, they\u2019re only jealous your parents got to see the kids.
