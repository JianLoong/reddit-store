I make more than him. He proposed with a ring that looked and felt cheap. He got a $500 ring off of Etsy. I said no to his proposal. \n\nHe said it shouldn\u2019t be about the ring but about the love we have for each other. I told him he clearly doesn\u2019t love me enough if he cheaped out on a ring while buying himself a high end Tesla. I bought him a $2K watch for his birthday that he wanted and dreamed of because I know he values that. But a ring I was going to wear for the rest of my life was worth less than a dinner at his favorite restaurant. \n\nIf I\u2019m going to marry someone, I want them to be generous with others. If my children wanted to be in extracurriculars, I want a man who would not bat an eyelash if they needed new equipment. I would want a man who spends time with his children and would give them the best part of the meat or the last snack. I would want a man who thinks of others before himself.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like ruining my body and the rest of my earnings potential for man who has demonstrated that he will not care about small things. I broke up with him. He called me a gold digger. If I was, I\u2019d get an older, wealthier man to pay my bills while I stay home. AITA?\n\nI would have been happy with a $500 ring if it were a different man. If he was poor and that was what he could afford and he thought about the ring, I would\u2019ve been happy.\n\nBut my ex boyfriend had expensive taste. He was willing to spend money on things he wanted and was happy to take my expensive gifts. But when the shoe is on the other foot, he demonstrated he didn\u2019t have the same care to me. He could easily afford something better.\n\nHe wanted me to be a SAHM.

A gift is a reflection of how that person regards and values you.  If this is how he feels about you when life is rosy and the relationship is passionate, how will it be when the chips are down?

Love and marriage are not about money and the cost of things,  they are about how you make each other feel, how you support each other etc.  \n\nWhy I lean to YTA:\n\nA) Your partner may have \"cheaped out\" on a $500 ring, but what if he thought you'd like that ring?  He may have put time and effort into choosing it, and it just so happened to be cheaper than others.  More expensive is not always better (in my personal opinion, a lot of the time more expensive jewellery is just gaudy and blingy - to show off rather than be a nice piece).\n\nB) He accepts $2000 gifts off you, which you seem to now begrudge, but he may also be just as happy with a $500 watch so long as he liked it.  Yes, this watch you mention was his dream watch, but he may have been perfectly happy with a different one.  You give a gift because you want to see them enjoy it, not so that they will get something of equal value in return.\n\nC) just because he spent $500 on a ring does not mean he won't be the man you want him to be - he could still be more than happy to pay for a childs extracurriculars, sporting equipment etc.  \n\nWhat pulls me away from outright saying YTA:\n\nIt feels to me he's *potentially* been harshly judged by you, it comes across to me that the value of your relationship is dependent on $$$.  Maybe too late now, but it makes me wonder if there were more deep rooted issues in the relationship that maybe weren't quite picked up on at the time, and maybe this is a seemingly small thing but just happened to be the straw that broke the camels back.  I think we could do with more info on how he with other gifts/his generosity for other things, rather than judging off an isolated incident.", "NTA.

Especially because she stated that if he didn't have mega expensive taste for himself and didn't make a lot of money - that it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nI really don't see how wanting your SO to treat you as good as they treat themselves is bad or 'greedy.'", "Well considering money is one of the main issues leading to divorce it\u2019s pretty smart to make sure you are on the same page before the wedding.", "\ud83d\ude02 yeh ok", "How ? \n\nOwning a Tesla doesn't magically make you superficial.", "Earnings comparison has nothing to do with being a gold digger", "Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll tell you she\u2019s a super chill girl who loves her tin ring.", "I think buying a cheap engagement ring makes absolute sense. How long do people even wear those for?", "He died before we could get married.", "It looked and felt cheap = ugly.\n\nLooking cheap is ugly. \n\nShe bought him a $2k ring for his birthday, he bought her a cheap, ugly ring that is supposed to be worn for life and signify their love.\n\nYou want _so bad_ for her to be a gold digger when in reality her ex is just cheap, selfish, and gross.", "No. She nuked the relationship because she realized that her boyfriend was selfish.", "He died you dick", "We haven't even seen this ring? How do you know it's shitty? And how are you gonna contradict yourself in one sentence? Money does not equate a person's worth.", "Jump to conclusions much? What does the value of a ring has to do with the value of the relationship? You're obviously just as materialistic as the OP.", "Her love is proportional to the amount of money she gets or is gifted", "How do you know that when he makes 100% of the household income, he won't pay 100% of the rent?", "What about a $2000 watch you want your partner to buy for you as a birthday gift then? Ah, probably fine as well, somehow.\n\nHonestly people here are either lesser bright than I thought to be possible or you all just pee your panties out of jealousy for a woman with a lot of money. Probably both.", "Lol ignore these broke salty losers. You\u2019re so clearly NTA and I applaud you for recognizing the signs of selfishness in your ex. That is not a man you should marry or god forbid start a family with", "If you refer to my actual comment on the post I said they were both materialistic and obnoxious. \n\nAgain, she specified that it looked *cheap*.", "Sounds like they both are materialistic. ESH.", "Boo-hoo?", "She said it in the post, the quality felt cheap. How is it contradicting my sentence, I'm saying not only he doesn't value her since he didn't at least get her a good quality ring tf?", "Thats a stupid question because he would have to or they'd be homeless.", "He **received** a 2k watch. Like, it was a gift. How is receiving a gift being superficial ? OP decided to buy it for him. \n\nI feel like you don't quite understand the meaning of \"being superficial\". Being superficial is not having money or expensive things.", "Yes, looking cheap is ugly\u2026..\n\nIt\u2019s not materialistic to buy your partner expensive things if you can both easily afford it. Engagement rings on top of that are meant to be a significant amount of money- they are worn for life and are a symbol of your love.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re not getting this.", "You sound like a real peach.", "Yeah but for arguments sake you and I haven't seen this and we're going off of her opinion. I've seen a lot of really gorgeous rings that were 500", "\"Felt cheap\" before or after she saw the receipt \ud83e\udd23\n\nI sincerely doubt OP is making 100k+ as a wedding ring appraiser, so she's unlikely to know \"cheap\" from \"expensive\" based on anything other than the size of a blood diamond.", "Right, so how is he a cheap ass for splitting rent now versus when OP is a sahm?", "That he wanted. Clearly he told OP what he sis want except she is a mind reader. And don't embarrass yourself as if you needed to explain anything to anyone. You can't even keep track of the sentence about the watch.\n\nWishing for expensive presents but being stingy yourself, yeah, that is superficial. See, the time can be read with watches far less expensive, by some of us, to your surprise, even if they are not ditital. But never mind, your jealous little heart won't get it anyway.", "Where in the post did it say he's dead?", "Because he's saving 60% from his rent and is cheaping out on gifts. Can't imagine that gets better as the money gets tighter. \n\nI pay 100% of my costs on less than half of what OPs bf makes. And I couldn't imagine getting a $500 etsy ring for my wife. If it was what she wanted, thats one thing. But it isnt.", "He is a cheap ass for having double financial standards: how much he gets (in gifts, in rent) vs how much he gives.\n\nAnd he is either dumb or jealous of OP success, if he suggests her - a higher earning partner who enjoys their career and who can easily pay for several nannies - to quit and become dependent of him. On him and his double financial standards..", "She said it in a comment. And your \u2018boo hoo\u2019 comment was cruel and unnecessary.", "Yes, and he\u2019s also using the money he saves to spoil himself (and himself alone) with expensive things. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll step up once OP puts herself at a significant disadvantage\u201d is not a good maybe to risk.", "How is he saving 60%? Are you thinking he should be paying 100% rent? At best he's saving 10% by not splitting it 50/50 instead of a more proportional split.", "This is because you\u2019re a decent man and a good partner."]}
