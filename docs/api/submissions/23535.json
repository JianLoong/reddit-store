If you have breathing trouble at all, you\u2019re in at least stage I anaphylaxis, possibly stage II.  You need to take this allergy seriously and address it.  The scary thing about anaphylaxis-inducing allergies is that they tend to get worse with more exposures and they can suddenly and unpredictably become MUCH worse.\n\nPlease do not wait until you can get to a doctor where you don\u2019t live.  You need to be seen and you probably need to carry an epi pen.\n\nNTA, but you\u2019re seriously underestimating the seriousness of your allergy.", "Oh FFS. \n\nNTA.\n\nIf you have an allergy to food you state you have an allergy to food. \n\nIt doesn't matter if X person has worse reaction to the food you are allergic than you, you both ALLERGIC to the food. \n\nAlso, all the poor undiagnosed ADHDers and Autistics TAKE NOTHING away from those with a diagnosis when they search out community and support for their neurodivergency.

She died minutes later in my friend's arms.\nTake the tests, allergies can become more serious as you grow older.", "NTA. If you know you react to tree nuts, you react to them. Allergies can be at different levels, it doesn't change the fact that it's an allergy and if you eat them, you'll have a reaction. You should absolutely tell the waitstaff about allergies because if something happens, not only will you not have a good time, but they could be liable. Also, some allergies can get stronger over time (e.g. bee/wasp stings) and you could become more allergic with more exposure.\n\nAnaphylaxis is not the only type of allergy to exist.

Your \"mild\" allergy (I wouldn't really consider difficulty breathing \"mild\" as somebody who also has allergies that cause me breathing problems) could turn into \"deadly\" by chance at any time. Repeat exposure of an allergen can and will change the way your body responds. Allergy responses to things are also ultimately unpredictable, and if the next time could land you in much worse shape even if your allergy has been pretty consistently not life threatening, that doesn't matter. \n\nBut allergy functions aside, it still doesn't take away from her boyfriend.

If you have a reaction to eating tree nuts then newsflash, you have an alergy.  Just because it won't require an EpiPen or hospitalization doesn't mean you're not alergic.

I get breathing issues and itchiness when exposed to less processed latex.  When I went through extensive medical treatment recently, the doctors said it was an allergy and not a sensitivity. Just because it doesn't cause anaphylaxis does not guarantee that it may never happen. There are people that eat certain foods (seafoods mainly) for almost their entire lifetimes, then suddenly develop an allergy. It can start out mild then progress to something worse. \n\nMy daughter is a chef. They were taught to always ask if someone is allergic to any types of foods. Lots of higher end restaurants adhere to that rule. It's absolutely acceptable to mention it before ordering.\n\nDoes your sister realize she prioritized her boyfriend's comfort over your medical concern? It sounds like her BF has a lot of empathy and she isn't on on the same level as him, as far as maturity goes.", "Definate NTA speaking as an allergy sufferer.    \n\nBut WTF   with the multiple hospital and epipens for the kid.

Your sister is so wrong it hurts me to read her reasoning. While your allergy isn't severe *now*, more than likely it will become severe at some point. You also stated you have trouble breathing, but not to the extent of having to go to the hospital, are you waiting until you turn blue? If you have trouble breathing, go to the hospital! Quit taking chances with your life, get tested immediately, and have the results sent to your GP. Oh, and your sister owes everyone who has any sort of \"difference\" an apology, she doesn't speak for us.", "NTA. Is your sister an allergist?", "NTA\n\nIf you have an allergy, you tell waitstaff at restaurants. Wanting to breathe is reasonable, and you never know if something will trigger it more.

Just because I won\u2019t need an epipen for it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t suffer. That said, I also agree that you definitely should have it checked out. You may need an epipen just in case it does get severe. My reaction to pineapple can range from severe to an irritation. I can\u2019t explain it, but the doctor has always provided me an epipen either way. You can never predict how you\u2019ll react to an allergy. Better safe than sorry.\n\nEdited to say: definitely NTA.", "NTA!\n\nHey there, OP, I have a severe tree nut allergy. Like, SEVERE. My allergist said it's one of the worst he's seen in his career. I have multiple epi-pens. I've had several visits to the ER. One time I had to go the ER and nearly died because someone cracked open nuts in the same room where I was sitting, and the tiny amount of dust in the air caused me to go into anaphylaxis. I didn't eat or even touch any of the nuts, I just got some tiny amount of dust in my mouth. That's the level of my severity, so I think I can speak with some authority on the matter:\n\nYOUR SISTER AND HER BOYFRIEND ARE THE ASSHOLES.\n\nYour sister and her boyfriend are the ones who are \"taking away from those who are severely allergic to tree nuts.\"\n\nPeople dismissing allergies of ANY severity is the reason why I frequently have people not believe me about my own allergies, and continually put me in danger. \n\nI really want people with mild allergies to order allergen-free food all the time, and here's why:\n\n\\- If someone with a mild allergen (or even just a sensitivity) orders allergen-free food and is served food with the allergen, they can inform the waiter/kitchen/manager of the issue (without nearly dying!), and they can work on fixing it. Sometimes suppliers will change ingredients, and the restaurant may not even know their previously allergen-free item now has the allergen in it until someone reacts. This ultimately reduces the risk for me.\n\n\\- As many others have stated, allergies can go from \"mild\" to \"life-threatening\" really quickly.\n\n\\- The more people that request allergen-free food (especially for very common allergens like tree nuts), the more the kitchen will be prepped and ready to make those foods. Again, this ultimately reduces the risk for me.\n\nThe only time someone \"takes away\" from those with severe allergies is when they DISMISS OTHER PEOPLE'S ALLERGIES (aka, your sister + her boyfriend) or when they do something dumb like say \"I'm allergic to tree nuts\" and then order and eat the cashew chicken, complete with the cashews.\n\nGood luck with your allergist appointment! If they plan on doing any testing, ask if you can bring Benadryl with you and take it once the test is over. I didn't bring any with me and had to wait until I was home to take it, and I was in agony the whole time.", "Just go to an allergist. I was allergic to shellfish but I\u2019m from a culture which has a diet very rich in seafood so I it was always written off as me being picky.  One day I had enough and went to an allergist, and took his report to show everyone. They stopped immediately. \n\nYes, would\u2019ve been nice if they accepted my allergy but I got the next best thing seeing an allergist which was that I was able to shut them up forever.\n\nBtw.

Firstly, you do have an allergy, that's not the same as not having ADHD but saying you do because of symptoms. Second, even those with ADHD who haven't been diagnosed yet, still have ADHD. It's not like it magically comes when you get the diagnosis. Also the undermining is very contextual, because some neurodivergent hindrances that neurotypical people can experience can be derived from the same cause (others, like the inability to work on something that does not spark any interest, is more complicated with brain wiring, thus that would be a more \"wait till u get diagnosed\"), so being able to help anyone is the goal right? It's just with people who are neurodivergent, we can see these hindrances as actual problems and find solutions, but they still benefit neurotypical people.", "NTA... an allergy is an allergy, no one should risk having to be uncomfortable just because it's less severe.

The truth of the matter is you can react mildly some times and badly others and for many the allergy is cumulative so if you start off being a little allergic to tree nuts and are exposed repeatedly it doesn't necessarily get better, it can get a whole lot worse.  Not wanting to be uncomfortable is a pretty reasonable desire and not one you have to justify.  Of course you need to tell a food preparer that info because restaurants can substitute expensive items like pine nuts for walnuts on salads, in pesto, on top of deserts, on breads.
