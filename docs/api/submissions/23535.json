I get breathing issues and itchiness when exposed to less processed latex.  When I went through extensive medical treatment recently, the doctors said it was an allergy and not a sensitivity. Just because it doesn't cause anaphylaxis does not guarantee that it may never happen. There are people that eat certain foods (seafoods mainly) for almost their entire lifetimes, then suddenly develop an allergy. It can start out mild then progress to something worse. \n\nMy daughter is a chef. They were taught to always ask if someone is allergic to any types of foods. Lots of higher end restaurants adhere to that rule.

You may need an epipen just in case it does get severe. My reaction to pineapple can range from severe to an irritation. I can\u2019t explain it, but the doctor has always provided me an epipen either way. You can never predict how you\u2019ll react to an allergy. Better safe than sorry.\n\nEdited to say: definitely NTA.", "NTA!\n\nHey there, OP, I have a severe tree nut allergy. Like, SEVERE. My allergist said it's one of the worst he's seen in his career. I have multiple epi-pens. I've had several visits to the ER. One time I had to go the ER and nearly died because someone cracked open nuts in the same room where I was sitting, and the tiny amount of dust in the air caused me to go into anaphylaxis. I didn't eat or even touch any of the nuts, I just got some tiny amount of dust in my mouth. That's the level of my severity, so I think I can speak with some authority on the matter:\n\nYOUR SISTER AND HER BOYFRIEND ARE THE ASSHOLES.\n\nYour sister and her boyfriend are the ones who are \"taking away from those who are severely allergic to tree nuts.\"\n\nPeople dismissing allergies of ANY severity is the reason why I frequently have people not believe me about my own allergies, and continually put me in danger. \n\nI really want people with mild allergies to order allergen-free food all the time, and here's why:\n\n\\- If someone with a mild allergen (or even just a sensitivity) orders allergen-free food and is served food with the allergen, they can inform the waiter/kitchen/manager of the issue (without nearly dying!), and they can work on fixing it. Sometimes suppliers will change ingredients, and the restaurant may not even know their previously allergen-free item now has the allergen in it until someone reacts. This ultimately reduces the risk for me.\n\n\\- As many others have stated, allergies can go from \"mild\" to \"life-threatening\" really quickly.\n\n\\- The more people that request allergen-free food (especially for very common allergens like tree nuts), the more the kitchen will be prepped and ready to make those foods. Again, this ultimately reduces the risk for me.\n\nThe only time someone \"takes away\" from those with severe allergies is when they DISMISS OTHER PEOPLE'S ALLERGIES (aka, your sister + her boyfriend) or when they do something dumb like say \"I'm allergic to tree nuts\" and then order and eat the cashew chicken, complete with the cashews.\n\nGood luck with your allergist appointment! If they plan on doing any testing, ask if you can bring Benadryl with you and take it once the test is over. I didn't bring any with me and had to wait until I was home to take it, and I was in agony the whole time.", "Just go to an allergist.

Firstly, you do have an allergy, that's not the same as not having ADHD but saying you do because of symptoms. Second, even those with ADHD who haven't been diagnosed yet, still have ADHD. It's not like it magically comes when you get the diagnosis. Also the undermining is very contextual, because some neurodivergent hindrances that neurotypical people can experience can be derived from the same cause (others, like the inability to work on something that does not spark any interest, is more complicated with brain wiring, thus that would be a more \"wait till u get diagnosed\"), so being able to help anyone is the goal right? It's just with people who are neurodivergent, we can see these hindrances as actual problems and find solutions, but they still benefit neurotypical people.", "NTA... an allergy is an allergy, no one should risk having to be uncomfortable just because it's less severe.

Not wanting to be uncomfortable is a pretty reasonable desire and not one you have to justify.
