Just because it doesn't cause anaphylaxis does not guarantee that it may never happen. There are people that eat certain foods (seafoods mainly) for almost their entire lifetimes, then suddenly develop an allergy. It can start out mild then progress to something worse. \n\nMy daughter is a chef. They were taught to always ask if someone is allergic to any types of foods. Lots of higher end restaurants adhere to that rule.

You may need an epipen just in case it does get severe. My reaction to pineapple can range from severe to an irritation.

Better safe than sorry.\n\nEdited to say: definitely NTA.", "NTA!\n\nHey there, OP, I have a severe tree nut allergy. Like, SEVERE. My allergist said it's one of the worst he's seen in his career. I have multiple epi-pens. I've had several visits to the ER. One time I had to go the ER and nearly died because someone cracked open nuts in the same room where I was sitting, and the tiny amount of dust in the air caused me to go into anaphylaxis. I didn't eat or even touch any of the nuts, I just got some tiny amount of dust in my mouth. That's the level of my severity, so I think I can speak with some authority on the matter:\n\nYOUR SISTER AND HER BOYFRIEND ARE THE ASSHOLES.\n\nYour sister and her boyfriend are the ones who are \"taking away from those who are severely allergic to tree nuts.\"\n\nPeople dismissing allergies of ANY severity is the reason why I frequently have people not believe me about my own allergies, and continually put me in danger. \n\nI really want people with mild allergies to order allergen-free food all the time, and here's why:\n\n\\- If someone with a mild allergen (or even just a sensitivity) orders allergen-free food and is served food with the allergen, they can inform the waiter/kitchen/manager of the issue (without nearly dying!), and they can work on fixing it. Sometimes suppliers will change ingredients, and the restaurant may not even know their previously allergen-free item now has the allergen in it until someone reacts. This ultimately reduces the risk for me.\n\n\\- As many others have stated, allergies can go from \"mild\" to \"life-threatening\" really quickly.\n\n\\- The more people that request allergen-free food (especially for very common allergens like tree nuts), the more the kitchen will be prepped and ready to make those foods. Again, this ultimately reduces the risk for me.\n\nThe only time someone \"takes away\" from those with severe allergies is when they DISMISS OTHER PEOPLE'S ALLERGIES (aka, your sister + her boyfriend) or when they do something dumb like say \"I'm allergic to tree nuts\" and then order and eat the cashew chicken, complete with the cashews.\n\nGood luck with your allergist appointment! If they plan on doing any testing, ask if you can bring Benadryl with you and take it once the test is over. I didn't bring any with me and had to wait until I was home to take it, and I was in agony the whole time.", "Just go to an allergist.

Firstly, you do have an allergy, that's not the same as not having ADHD but saying you do because of symptoms. Second, even those with ADHD who haven't been diagnosed yet, still have ADHD. It's not like it magically comes when you get the diagnosis. Also the undermining is very contextual, because some neurodivergent hindrances that neurotypical people can experience can be derived from the same cause (others, like the inability to work on something that does not spark any interest, is more complicated with brain wiring, thus that would be a more \"wait till u get diagnosed\"), so being able to help anyone is the goal right? It's just with people who are neurodivergent, we can see these hindrances as actual problems and find solutions, but they still benefit neurotypical people.", "NTA... an allergy is an allergy, no one should risk having to be uncomfortable just because it's less severe.

Not wanting to be uncomfortable is a pretty reasonable desire and not one you have to justify.

My sister used to have a \"mild\" nut allergy. It was incredibly obvious that it was an allergy, as she would have breathing problems, swell up, and develop hives. Not hospital worthy as a benadryl would handle it and she hated doctors and hospitals - as most young children do. At first, it was just peanuts, and treated as a mild allergy. Because it wasn't an anaphylactic reaction, a LOT of people didn't take it seriously and would eat peanuts and peanut products around her. One day, her school had a bake sale fundraiser. There were some delicious looking brownies for $0.50 and she really wanted one. She asked if there were nuts in it and the person who made them - who was a friend of hers and knew about it but didn't believe in her allergy - said there wasn't. There VERY MUCH WAS. They were made with chunky peanut butter. She ate it and apparently it was delicious... Until her throat started to close. She started to panic as her throat closed, her face swelled to the point of her eyes being unable to be opened, and her skin erupted in hives. Someone uses their epi-pen on her and she's rushed to the hospital. Turns out, allergies that are regularly triggered can get much much worse, so it's advised to treat all allergies as severe and avoid the allergen. It's also a possibility that allergies that are regularly exposed can cause \"sister allergies\" to activate, which is exactly what happened to my sister. She was only allergic to peanuts, but is now allergic to all tree nuts, peanuts, and several other allergies.\n\nDon't feel like an asshole. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA.

I have a few allergies that they didn't test for, that I've found I have reactions to, now.

Occasionally, we will have some people say \"I have a nut allergy\" which will then trigger me to go through our whole procedure in which I will tell them, these ingredients and dishes are off limits because they have possible exposure to nuts. When I tell them this, they will then say \"It's fine it's not a serious allergy\". That gets really annoying because if your allergy was serious enough for me to make sure everything is nut free and then you go ahead and tell me that it's not serious and all the precautions I took doesn't really matter, do you really have an allergy or are you just trying to be a little pick-me.

A mild allergy can get exponentially worse at random. You just never know.", "Ok, i need to comment on this because I have both a Treenut Allergy and ADHD. \n\nFirst off, NTA. Rule one of having a food allergy, tell waitstaff you have the allergy when out to eat. What if something in a coating had nuts in it? Or cross contamination was enough to make breathing difficult? The staff would rather know and be aware of how to help then have you have a reaction and potentially sue them. I tell every waiter/waitress i have that I have an allergy when I go to a new restaurant to avoid having a reaction. While mine isn\u2019t a mild reaction (i go into anaphylactic shock and my airway closes), making sure they know prevents reactions from happening.\nTwo, there is a name for people who have ADHD symptoms. It is usually ADHD. The spectrum of ADHD and autism(and related) is a spectrum. While neurotypical people may have some aspects, neurodivergent people experience them differently. And there is something called accommodations for people who have it documented by medical professionals. I have them at work, so I can do my job. I told my boss about them so we could make sure I can do my job. You know who I don\u2019t tell I have ADHD? People who don\u2019t need to know(ie waitstaff or people out and about who it won\u2019t affect).\n\nThese two things are not even remotely the same. Like comparing a broken arm with a migraine. They don\u2019t have anything to compare because they are different things. You did the right thing by telling the waitstaff you have an allergy, and your sisters boyfriend showed you that he cared enough to ask about it. Your sister on the other hand is absolutely TAH.
