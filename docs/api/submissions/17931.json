I'm sorry for this tough time. High five for being a supportive parent to your son. It sounds like he really needed you.", "NTA.\n\nYour son deserves to know that he has someone in his corner, especially if his maternal relatives feel the same way about him as your wife.\n\nSitting with him at the funeral doesn't mean that you were choosing him over your wife; it means that you love your son.", "NTA, you're brave, supportive and loving. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA - of course you\u2019re not. You were ready to divorce your wife over this, so who gives AF what her family thinks.", "NTA - you supported your son through a tough time losing his mom and having to go to her funeral.", "NTA - pretty sure God doesn\u2019t like bigots either.", "NTA - You did not choose anyone over your wife, you chose to support your son who had just lost his mother. While I respect her family is grieving, you owe them nothing and did nothing wrong here. If I were you , I would avoid them going forward. I lost my husband a few years ago and while I was blessed with supportive in-laws for the most part, there were a few who I choose to disengage from as much as possible. Just because we have a shared grief does not make me obligated to allow them to be an active part of my life, and you aren't obligated in any way to your in-laws either.", "NTA and maybe this is the last you get to hear from them. Even if you went with the divorce, it wouldn't have been any different. At least now you don't have to deal with any of them. When a parent fails a child for whatever reason, its the parent's failure and not that of the child. Well done on being there with your son who otherwise would have been alone.", "NTA. You are a hero! Your stayed with your wife and put the divorce on hold to help her. Once that was over, you rightfully put your son first. He will never forget that you stood up for him. You were a great husband and you are a great father.\n\nI'm sorry for you loss. It must be very difficult to lose someone you loved under such circumstances.", "NTA\nIt seems the problems you had with your wife prior to her death were here doing, not yours. Sitting with and supporting your son who's just lost his mother was the right thing to do. Your wife's family are AHs, you are a good Dad", "NTA. Appeasing bigots is always wrong, *especially* if it's against your own child. You're doing the right thing, even if the disgusting bigots in your family won't see that.", "NTA. You supported your son from a family that\u2019s turned against him for his sexuality. You should be proud of what you did, that\u2019s great parenting.\n\nThere\u2019s no world where you\u2019re the asshole here.", "NTA - You\u2019re an absolutely brilliant father, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nYour son is going to remember this moment for the rest of his life, and that you stood up for him against your wife\u2019s bigoted family. Keep it up.", "Hell no! NTA! NTA!\n\nThose family members can get bent. Although, since you were planning on divorcing her, you probably weren't going to be seeing much of them anyway.", "NTA- you were still legally married to your wife so YOU get to have a say at her funeral and nobody else .\n\nYou should have invited her Brother to leave if he\u2019s so mad about it.\n\nYou\u2019re not a disgrace , they are. \n\nThank you for standing up for your son.", "NTA and why the fuck are you even still talking to those horrible people?", "NTA. Your son was a truly gracious for attending and trying to show respect for his mother, who didn\u2019t return the courtesy.  \n\nHer family should all be ashamed of themselves.  I cannot fathom treating the son of the deceased that way,  and of course he is also their grandson, nephew etc.\n\nI hope with her passing you can close that horrible chapter in your life and have no contact with them anymore, there\u2019s no reason", "First I am so sorry for your loss.  Even if you weren\u2019t happy with your wife and her choices, you stood by her, have had a horrible few years an it sucks watching someone die from cancer.  \n\nWhy in the hell would her family have anything to say or do with the funeral?   She was technically still your wife, therefore you and your children should have planned the funeral.    You were not wrong.  Relatives that are not supportive during a funeral can be dismissed with prejudice.  I understand they are also going through their own grief, but that doesn\u2019t give them the right to berate and belittle.\n\nHow the heck did you choose your son over your wife?   Your wife is dead.  Your son has so many emotions right now, probably the biggest being that he will never resolve things with his mom.  How is your daughter doing through all this?\n\nYour choices are simple now.  Anyone who wants to continue with this \u201cyou are horrible/son is horrible/your wife was a saint\u201d or whatever version they spew . . .   \u201cI have nothing to say to you and do not want to hear from you again.\u201d   Hang up on them, have their emails go directly to junk.  If they approach you, your hand held up with palm facing them is a pretty universal signal to keep your mouth shut.   Then turn around and walk away.", "I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nNTA - I hope you and your son can lean on each other as you both go through the grief of losing someone close to you. \n\nI've found it is a weird mix of emotions when you love someone yet disagree with their actions or choices and then they pass. Please take the time to process and acknowledge emotions - both in you and your grown kids.", "NTA. Thank you for being there for your son! I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You\u2019re well shod of these terrible bigots. Good luck to you and your son.", "Funerals are for the bereaved. She was your son's mother and he was likely grieving even though it was a difficult relationship. She had no further needs you could meet, and he needed love and support.\n\nI cannot imagine a less AH way to handle that situation. NTA.", "NTA. Damn, never thought I'd root for the cancer. You did the right thing. You sat with your family.", "Nta. Fuck those people. Thankfully you don't have to deal with them anymore and I wouldn't.  That's a terrible way to treat your son", "NTA, you stood up as a Father to support his son during a time of loss. Your son will never forget this.", "NTA, you are a loving and supportive father!!!", "NTA. Your son needs your support, you did well by staying next to him during the service. You made the right choice and showed the right path with your actions.", "NTA. Might I say they can go F**k themselves. May you live long with the laughter of you\u2019re grandchildren in you\u2019re ears. PS wife\u2019s family should be happy they got an invite to the funeral.", "You\u2019re not an asshole, you\u2019re a saint. Good on you for supporting your son, and letting their hatefulness roll off your back. And I assume there\u2019s no reason to continue interacting or corresponding with them at this point, so no great loss there.", "NTA thank you for supporting your son!", "NTA- Don't the wedding vows say until death do us part?  You are parted now, there is no reason to deal with her family anymore. Tell them to go fuck themselves you have a son who needs you now.", "NTA \nAlways choose your children over other people.\nWho do you want to spent your time with? Those people who are uptight, or your son who has been there even when his mother pushed him away?", "NTA, and look, not only your wife's family is a major AH, but it seems to me that she was also, you are a good guy suffering just because you are treating your son the right way and not being bigoted", "NTA.  And if, now that your wife has passed on, you don't see a future where you have anything to do with your inlaws anymore you could always drop the \"I was going to divorce her but chose to be there for her through the cancer\" thing on them to let them know just what you actually thought of the way she and they treated of your son.  They'll hate you, but then again it sounds like they don't like you much anyway.", "OMG.\n\nNTA\n\nSo now that she passed , hopefully you can rebuild a relationship with your son. Im sure you need each other\u2019s support now. Who cares what the in law family feels. You were about to divorce her, they\u2019re behavior towards you would be no different and honestly you actually don\u2019t ever have to speak to them again. Protect your son, that is the relationship that matters\nJust play it back in your head. Her family wanted you to shun YOUR child in remembrance of how his mother horribly treated him and you asserted yourself and said NO. You did the only right thing. May you guys heal", "NTA, I hope your daughter is more like you then that side of the family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Get as far away as you can from these awful, toxic people!", "NTA-your son is so lucky to have you.", "This is a blessing.  Now that shes gone and her family is shunning you, you can cut them off and live a happy life with your son.  His family is the one who matters here, not bigots who you arent even blood related to.", "NTA. You\u2019re brave for standing up for what you believe in. Your son needed you because he was mourning someone he loved who did no love him back unconditionally like you have.

Honestly it\u2019s probably better if they are angry with you, it will make transitioning away from them and towards your child much easier. They won\u2019t bring you the same love and Joy being part of your sons life ever will. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m pretty sure wife is looking down from wherever the heck she ended up realizing being gay isn\u2019t wrong or a sin and I\u2019m going with she doesn\u2019t think you chose him over her. My beliefs yes, but I think deep in our hearts they aren\u2019t okay with their choices which is why they have so much hostility. We aren\u2019t hostile when we know in our hearts the choices we make for us are for us alone because they are best for us. When you try to get outside validation it\u2019s because you\u2019re unsure and need people to back you up. You\u2019re not backing them up so you\u2019re cast aside; there\u2019s no room for those who don\u2019t support their beliefs and then make them feel insecure: you knew deep down all this time your son is fine the way he is, which is why you didn\u2019t force anyone to choose sides. Anyways I don\u2019t really know more than anyone else but it never feels good to hold onto anger", "NTA. And screw her family..if they can truly be that big of dicks during her funeral because you sat with HER SON,(Whether she liked it or not he is still her damn son) then I'd say good riddance.", "You will never be TA for choosing your child. Way to be a top notch Dad.", "NTA. \n\nYou are never in the wrong when you support your child being themselves. He deserves your love and support and you deserve his in return.

You get to enjoy your life & have your relationship with your child. Live it to the fullest.", "Well fucking done!

Being a good father does not make you an asshole. Shame on those family members.", "Nta.\n\nYour wife's family sounds horrid. Hating their own because he's gay.\n\nDisgusting people.", "NTA. Not to be morbid and Frank. But with the passing of your wife, and their absolute dislike for your son. You don\u2019t really have any ties with them anymore, so does it matter what these people think? And that tensions have arisen? You were thinking of divorce, so why care and be bothered by what bigots think?", "NTA you made the right choice. If your late wife's family chose to distance from you it is simply the trash taking themselves out. \n\nIm sure there are difficult and complicated emotions for you and your son right now, focus on your kids and tell your in-laws to go get stuffed.  I wish you and your children all the best for better days to come", "Nta. You did not choose your son over your wife; you chose right over wrong. Loving someone and promising to stand by them does not include when they are harming others, especially your child. You and your son literally took care of her, imo you held up your vows wonderfully and you are a great dad.", "NTA \n\nAnd thank you for being a good dad. I'm sorry your wife never got over her hate before she passed. And her family can pound sand.", "NTA.  Your son will always be your son.

You\u2019re a father, you put your child first, as you should. They really think they can give you crap for being supportive of your own kid??? And to say these ugly things at a funeral of all places?? Fuck these homophobes. If it were me I would never speak to these people again. Those comments were disgusting and totally inappropriate.", "NTA.  Good riddance to the bigoted in-laws.  Sorry for your family\u2019s loss.", "NTA, wow! What a nasty position for her family to hold at HIS mom's funeral!", "As they always say around here, karma always comes, you should have divorced without hesitation, even though she had cancer she was homophobic and a shitty mother, NTA, I also wonder why you doubt when it's clear that you know that being homophobic is wrong", "NTA.  Your son is part of your family.  Had the deceased wife not gotten cancer and died, she'd have been an ex wife and no longer part of your family.  It's reasonable to conclude that her family is no longer part of your family, so choosing your son was the right move.\n\nIt was noble of you to stick around and care for her despite wanting a divorce.  You showed more grace in doing that than she was capable of. \n\nAs an aside...apparently ex bil doesn't understand that funerals are not held *for* the dead, they are for the living to mourn their passing.", "You\u2019re a good dad. NTA, no question.", "No, my dear sweet man, you are not an AH at all. Of course you sat with your son. God bless you for taking the stand you did. In time I hope you can forgive and pray for these people who want to carry anger and hatred past the gates of death. \n\nNTA.", "He\u2019s your son man. You did him so proud \nNTA", "You supported your son.  You should have moved with your son to the usual family seating.  Your wife, you and your children are a core family.  Others are extended family.  If they could not honor your core family\u2019s need to support each other at the funeral that is their problem.  Do not cut the various relatives out of your lives.  Your children should be able to have a relationship with extended family.  If your wife\u2019s family turn their backs you will at least know you and your kids were willing to try, but your in-laws were/will be the jerks if they burn the bridges.", "Your son lost his mother twice. However much he and you know she was wrong and her views were despicable, the pain he has to be feeling and the depth and complexity of his emotions are indescribable. He needed you more than anyone. I wish what you did weren\u2019t unusual, but people too often excuse or gloss over bigotry from loved ones. You are an exceptional father\n\nNTA and the unconditional love and support you continue to show your son means more than most of us could fathom", "NTA, but can you go NC with your wife's family? And I'm sorry for your loss. May you hold your memories close.", "NTA. Not to speak ill of the dead, but your wife and her family suck. If you were looking to divorce anyway, what her family thinks of you shouldn't matter at all. Dump them and be there for your son.", "What sort of people are they to act this way towards the last remaining part of her?", "And kudos for handling yourself. I would've started a fight at that funeral.", "Yeah and I'm betting if she believed in heaven and hell, she went south rather than north after she passed. Jesus loved and helped the poor, the disgraced, and the leopards of the world. No way he would be against the LGBTQIA+ community. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss OP. This is going to be a lot for you and your son to process.

He never even married or anything like that. \nGranted he\u2019s not real but that\u2019s not the point.", "And your son did his best to help take care of her during her illness. He would have been completely justified to cut her out of his life. How much did he family help with her care?", "I always hate to speak ill of the dead but there\u2019s a special place in hell for moms who don\u2019t support their children\u2019s sexuality. \n\nAnd god says to love your children and not judge others. So if she was a Christian, she was a poor excuse of one.", "I feel like setting a pride flag on her casket would make her have a heart attack, even in death.", "Depending on OP's belief system telling them their wife is gone may not be a comforting or effective message. Better to just focus on the benefit they provided their son.", "Shit-tier bigoted losers. That\u2019s the sort of people they are. \n\nI bet they talk a great Jesus game, but when it comes time to do what JC said (love your neighbor) they fail, hard-core.", "The kind that think \"Well, atleast the daughter is straight/not living in sin!\"", "I would have asked the funeral home director how many extra caskets they had in the back.", "Or your sons name.", "Nope. Not even .000000001% the a-hole. Not only was he supportive of his son when he came out, he did NOT support his wife or her family being jerks to his son. So much so that he was planning to divorce his wife for the way she treated his son. Then, because he is amazing, OP put the divorce on hold and cared for his (selfish, uncaring) wife during her cancer battle and stayed with her until the very end. And he\u2019s still supporting his son, who really needs it. That mom left him with lots of issues to deal with. \n\nI\u2019d say he\u2019s definitely NTA.", "Also, in put in the unfortunate situation where you need to pick between your spouse and your kid, unless there\u2019s a compelling reason otherwise you have to pick the kid. \n\nOn the upside OP never has to deal with these assholes again.", "Exactly. He *should* choose his son over his homophobic bigot wife", "Grief can be complex. You can mourn not only who you thought the person was (before they demonstrated their bigotry) but you can mourn the loss of the relationship that you had with them, and love isn\u2019t an on/off switch. Hell, I have ex-friends (that I once considered family) that have become raging bigoted assholes, and I still care (albeit from a safe distance) about what happens to them. (For example, when one lost their last surviving parent, I responded when they reached out to let me know, and offered my help if needed.)", "Lol I was thinking it - Might end up being more of a gain than a loss...", "I saw that too. \n\nHe's NTA for the situation at the funeral.\n\nBut I think he's TA for letting his wife treat his son like that for 9 years.\n\nAt first, I was like \"Ok, he's 19. It's only been 3 years since he came out, and 1 year of that his mom had cancer, so maybe OP was hoping she would come around...\"\n\nBut 9 years? That's accepting someone being a bigot against your child.", "Ya this didn\u2019t escape my notice. I didn\u2019t want to kick a guy when he is down and his wife just died but he didn\u2019t exactly do much to support his son other than \u201cdistance himself\u201d from his wife, whatever that means. \n\nAnd it\u2019s his wife\u2019s funeral, he could have told her entire family to get fucked for ostracizing the deceased *own son*, but instead he just\u2026sits with him. I\u2019m not trying to downplay what the dad did, maybe this is the best he can do, but the primary connection to his wife\u2019s bigoted family is now gone. What exactly is stopping him from telling them they can accept his son or kindly eat a dick?", "That was one of my thoughts as well. Grief is confusing and I, personally, hate it. From an outsiders perspective, what does the son have to grieve about? \n\nWell, the relationship that he used to have with his mom \u2014 the good one before he came out as gay \u2014 even if it has been a while. Like it or not, but he could have hoped that his mother would change her views and accept him. \n\nSometimes, you miss how someone use to be \u2014 and when death comes along, that person is lost forever with no hope of coming back.", "Yes, I was wondering about the daughter. I hope she takes after dad and not mom.", "I'm thinking daughter is ok with it all, or at least neutral, ad you'd think OP would have included her when writing about the family who didn't accept his son. The omission seems to point to her not being one of those hateful family members but she might still be involved with them. OP is NTA though. Funerals are for the living, and the only one he needed to support was his son who was blatantly ostracised at his own mothers funeral. Would have been good if his daughter sat with them too though, that's my query", "Why do you think that? Is it a guilt by association  thing based on creeps like the wife\u2019s family acting cruelly and holier than thou or something else like bad experiences with other \u201creligious\u201d hypocrites? I care because I have had healing and positive supernatural experiences with people who genuinely love God and are loving nonjudgmental people as well as supernatural intervention to alter the laws of physics and literally save my life from accidents and once from strangulation. I always feel badly when someone expresses a belief that God is evil and didn\u2019t care when I know He saved me from evil and abusive family members and other people. Your thoughts?", "Jesus wasn\u2019t though.", "At dealing with evil people who were dangerous brutal perpetrators and predators going after His people. The vengeance was always to protect the innocent from people who would not relent from their own self-directed decisions and choices to kill, steal and destroy others without provocation! Punishing people who burned their children alive and were dangerous to others by enslaving them. The vengeance was ALWAYS within the context of protecting the innocent\u2014-and as a last resort after repeated warnings. You have to read it ALL in context for yourself. \n\nWhat kind of good God doesn\u2019t hold perpetrators responsible for their actions? Thats injustice, not vengeance. There\u2019s a world of difference.", "[deleted]", "Given he was going to divorce her, maybe he wanted them to do it.", "Jesus was real; it's the Son of God part that's a fantasy.", "That's exactly my point. Why never marry? Cause you couldn't marry a man back then!!", "These get more over the top every day.", "God loves everybody right?  \n\nThat's what Christians preach.\n\nJust not what they practice.\n\nEverybody includes ....well everybody.......Trans, bis, gays, pornstars...etc.", "I really have to agree so much. I\u2019ve had a really rare aggressive form of cancer twice. It sucks. I always say I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone but I\u2019m encountering many people who challenge this thinking.", "\ud83d\ude05", "And we would\u2019ve told you that if you intended to cause issues, not to attend, even if you are the NOK & paying contract name. We\u2019ll do our best to keep one or two particular people away, but we will not tolerate a service being held with the intention of a fight.", "I love this idea!", "Hell YES!", "After 8 years of her being a bigot against his kid, he was \"thinking about divorcing her\"\n\nSorry, but that isn't exactly father of the year material.\n\nA year, maybe two, I could understand.\n\nBut 8 years just to \"consider divorcing her\"? Nah.. that guy was gladly supporting a bigot.", "Let's not go too far. His son came out 9 years ago and moved out 5 years ago, and OP never got further than \"looking into divorce\". How is that proof of being supportive?\n\nAlso, why was his brother in law leading the funeral arrangements? Couldn't OP have insisted the wife's core family (OP, son, daughter, associated sons in law or daughters in law) get the central seats/ first row?", "I think he\u2019s at least a bit of the a-hole. He spent 9 years letting his wife and her family treat his son like crap and bullying him at events. And then he only put his son first after his wife died. I cannot imagine treating my child like that or letting anyone else do that to him. \n\nLike sure he put the divorce on hold at the very end - but what\u2019s his excuse for the previous 8 years?\n\nAll he did is become \u201cdistant\u201d with his wife. Like c\u2019mon. \n\nFinally choosing him after 9 years doesn\u2019t make up for nearly a decade of tolerating bigots. \n\nThe son deserves better. ESH except him.", "So you'd be OK with letting someone, even your spouse, be a bigot toward your child for 8 years and only \"consider\" leaving them?\n\nYour definition of \"0.00000001%\" and mine are way different. Maybe you're just more comfortable living with a hateful bigot than I am.\n\nI'm starting to doubt if OP was ever considering divorcing her. I think he realized that he either needed to hang out with her family (who he likely didn't get along with) or be with his son, who was his long-term insurance plan.", "Not love with a bigot.", "This is simply hateful. OP did the right thing by supporting his son who has done nothing wrong, but that was still the mother of his children who I\u2019m sure he still had love for even if he disagreed and was rightly disgusted with her bigotry. Show some respect to the people who are left behind.", "We don't know how long she had cancer before she died. Maybe he was trying to do the right thing.", "Yeah, it was the same for me. At first, holy shit ofc you want her to come around, to grow and change and be the figure he needed because the son only has one mother. But year after year after year after year? No way.", "Old Testament God was angry and vengeful. Those Scriptures give fuel to current bigots.", "Hmmm can\u2019t say the dude comes off well in the book series.", "Cool that he saved you, too bad he couldn't save all the babies with cancer...\n\nThat's why we believe if there is a god ( and we're saying that hypothetically, we know there isn't one), he's either not all powerful, doesn't care about us, or is actively evil.", "Every organized religion does, that's for sure.\n\nThe Jesus of the actual Bible? Not so much.\n\nTell today's Christians they're behaving unbiblically, though, and they'll turn your other cheek for you.", "Yeah, pretty sure I would have been like \"Do whatever you want and I'll show up.\" The wife sounds just as shitty as her family.", "That doesn't answer my question tho lol..out of pocket things DO happen. Shocker, I know", "Thank you for all you do.  The funeral directors my family has dealt with over the years have made dealing with terribly hard things easier.", "Add a note saying you\u2019ve added them to the weekly prayer list.", "Yeah, the more I think about it... OP is N T A for the funeral, but he is a pretty giant AH for letting his wife treat his kid like crap for nearly a decade without doing anything about it.", "I guess I'm just thinking of the son who doesn't have to be on the receiving end of all her hate anymore", "He said she got diagnosed last year.", "That may be true, but that was still his mother. Now he\u2019s been robbed of the opportunity for her to change her mind and apologize to him for the hurt she caused. Of course an apology would never erase the feeling of being rejected by someone who was meant to love him unconditionally, but it would have been a start towards healing. Just try and show a little compassion for the living, rather than judge the imperfect dead.", "I don't know how I missed that. Thank you", "All of this. He obviously still cared whether or not he hoped for reconciliation, considering he tried to help with her care. As another commenter stated, grief can be/is complex. There are probably so many feelings swirling around inside OP and son, and while her bigotry should still be abhorred, they are allowed to be sad. I completely agree.", "Wow, I can't imagine someone going to the grave rejecting their own child.  It takes a hard heart.  NTA", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\n\nIn all cases, choosing your child over a bigot is the correct response. That goes double when the bigot is the other parent and the child needs more support because of that. It goes triple when the bigot is already dead and not there to have her shitty feelings hurt any more anyway. You sound like a great Dad.", "Nta.  Support your son, and f*** off anyone who disagrees", "Fuck them all.\n\nNTA and NC\n\nNo reason on the planet for you to even acknowledge their existence ever again. I'd have left her the day I knew she \"disapproved\" of your son, cancer be damned. \n\nMy deepest sympathies. Not just for your wife's passing but for the sheer toxicity you had to put up with. Take a few months and you'll see. There are a lot of truly amazing women our age and you sound like a really decent guy.", "Clear NTA. \nMy biggest question is, where did your daughter sit?", "100% NTA. You can safely cut any remaining ties with a clear conscience.", "NTA. Fuck her family though. Sounds like a cesspool. \n\nGood for you.", "NTA. As a gay man, you are the father every gay son needs. You may not have done everything perfectly regarding him and his sexuality and that\u2019s ok. What matters most is that you stood up for him. You didn\u2019t give up on him. You made him a priority in the face of backlash from your wife\u2019s bigoted family. I don\u2019t know what your relationship is like with your son now, but keep proving to your son how much you love him and how nothing will get in the way of that.", "Really??\n\nYou\u2019re \u2018unsure\u2019 if a parent would be an AH for sitting by their young adult child (during ***their mother\u2019s*** funeral) vs sitting by a BIL?\n\n*REALLY*?\n\nNTA for where you sit.\n\nYTA for even wondering.\n\nI would cry for your child (if I wasn\u2019t certain this was karma baiting nonsense).", "I'm sorry but this post is just wayyyy too on the nose.\n\nI'm calling fake.", ">I(52M) was with my wife(53F) since high school. We got married and had a son(25M) and daughter(27F). My son came out as gay when he was 16. My wife was never supportive of my son being gay. He moved out at 19 to live with his boyfriend. My wife tried to pretend he did not exist.\n\nI'm sorry, did you stay with your wife for *years* after your son came out and she rejected him? What's up with that?", "YTA.\n\nNot because of sitting with your son at her funeral, but because you stayed married to her for NINE YEARS after she blatantly rejected your son due to her raging homophobia.\n\nI\u2019m surprised he showed up at her funeral at all, and I\u2019m surprised he forgives you at all for not choosing him when he was 16.", "NAH its just what it is", "I see an A H, but it isn\u2019t OP. You\u2019re a good dad, OP, and like it or not, you did make a statement \u2014 but I would say it was *the right one*. I can\u2019t imagine how your son felt growing up \u2014 and I definitely need to thank my parents at some point \u2014 but I have a feeling that you probably helped him more than you could ever know. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m surprised your son helped during the treatment and came to the funeral, but for whatever reason he did, I hope he found closure or came to peace with everything.\n\nI wish you both the best of luck with *that* side of the family \u2014 whether if you cut them off or you keep them in your lives. \n\nAlso, I feel like you should break into their properties and hang pride flags everywhere. If they noticed them, *then they are no longer pretending that LGBTQ community doesn\u2019t exist.* \n\nNTA. :)", "It was extremely hard seeing my wife want nothing to do with our son especially when she was sick. She gave all of her attention to our daughter.", "High five for staying with your wife while she was sick  because she really didn't deserve it.", "In fact, you're verging on saintly for not decking her brother. What a jerk....", "At least OP doesn\u2019t have put up with these awful people anymore and be open about being a father to a gay son.", "Sounds like he was terribly upset with the situation, distanced himself and sought a divorce and then she got cancer and needed care and died before he could divorce her.\n\nWhat was he supposed to do? Leave her to suffer alone and unable to care for herself. She's still his wife.", "It\u2019s lepers but I like leopards better. Lol", "You did right, OP.", "I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be be disrespectful, but she was a *ghoul*.", "I'm so sorry you and your son went through that. I'm glad he has you, though.", "Can I ask where ur daughter is in all of this? I really hope her maternal families poison hasn't claimed her too.", "It's actually fairly common for men to leave their ill wife so OP is just a legit good human, even to ppl who don't deserve it!", "Frankly, from the sound of it, I would choose a cactus in my shoe over his wife's family.\n\n>He even went as far as to say that my wife did not want her son there as he was a disgrace. \n\nSuperhuman composure, imo, to not lay him out on the spot.  Wife's family can eat glass.  OP should forget them and be a father to his son.  NTA.", "Her husband and kids and their SOs belonged in the front row. I wonder who paid for the funeral?", "I'm not sure if I'm more sorry that his wife died or that the world is a better place as a result", "Honestly if I was the OP's kid I would not have been anywhere near as kind.\n\nProbably would have even told her that her cancer is god's response to her actions in life. Basically Karma's a bitch.\n\nI'm definitely an asshole but fuck it I'd call the bitch out.", "Exactly. My mom is a conservative, Christian woman. I always knew coming out to her might be an issue and held back for way too long. I did finally come out to her and she did struggle but it turned out her pastor helped her come to terms with it. She was already under the impression I might be gay and started doing the work before I came out.  She realized that loving me unconditionally was what her faith compelled her to do. She now adores my girlfriend and treats her like family. She loves how happy I am with her. I am so fortunate and wish others had a similar experience with their religious family, but it seems I am the exception.", "God says to throw away your kids if they won't follow him. So no, there's a special place in heaven for people like her. Thankfully, that's far away from hell where us evil queers will be throwing the biggest blowout ever to celebrate eternal separation from that mess!", "I am a Pagan, but if I could I would will the worst Christian hell into existence just to send my abusive bigoted mother there.", "Let\u2019s put it this way, if she\u2019s in heaven, she\u2019s too happy to care, if she\u2019s in hell, she has other things to worry about.", "Personal experience: I did that to my friend\u2019s homophobic neighbors. ALL. THE. PAMPHLETS!! I also sent pamphlets on STDs and couples therapy. One was titled something like \u201cwhat to do when he cheats\u201d. We also had our own pride pool party in the backyard with ALL the 90s dance club music. We\u2019re all huge animal lovers too so we got some amazing drag queens to read to shelter dogs and cats.

The god of the Bible is the one that forbid humans from eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and then kicked them out of the garden from where they could eat from the tree of life. He is the one who made a bet to make a man\u2019s life miserable. He is the one who called a man righteous after he offered up his virgin daughters to be gang raped. The god of the Bible is the one who allows people to go to hell, he is the one who describes himself as jealous and want his creations to worship him, sell their soul to him. I could go on", "The biblical flood supposedly killed everyone on earth except a few people in an ark. Most of those people would have been completely innocent. There are many other instances of this happening.", "Wow justifying murder, rape, and slavery to \"protect innocent people\".\n\nYou're in a cult.", "No he wasn\u2019t.", "I agree.

Bless her.\n\nNTA, OP. You're the hero. And you should be proud of your son who displayed so much mercy and grace. Don't apologize for anything.

I will be right there with you.", "We don't have that timeline.

I\u2019d be more surprised if op completely lost all his love for wife once he found out. \n\nEven the son stepped up to help out despite his feelings, when nobody (except maybe wife\u2019s family) would\u2019ve blamed him for refusing to do so.", "Far too often that is true. Sadly.", "I don't like the broad brushstrokes that group us alltogether....instead say many christians are so unlike....besides Jesus knew we were oh so fallible", "I second this. It takes a special type of person and personality to be a funeral director, and a **great** one, at that. For the families who can't say thank you in their worst times, please accept my gratitude and know that your work is appreciated!", "& u/fantasticfiefdom325 Thank you. Both these comments mean so much to me. It\u2019s a fairly thankless job sometimes but it\u2019s also very fulfilling at the same time. We understand you\u2019re not always aware during grief- we\u2019ve lost people too and we\u2019re human as well. Grief affects everyone differently. \n\nWorking in the industry was my dream since I was 14 years old and while some days are awful, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever truly give it up- burnout is a real thing and I\u2019m seeing many of my coworkers leave now (working through covid emotionally damaged a lot of us, myself included) but I think I\u2019ll always participate part time as an usher or assistant. It\u2019s very much a passion and a calling.", "Considering how he tried to help her while she was sick, even though she was pushing him away, it doesn't exactly sound like he just wanted her gone. She was terrible to him, but he loved her, too. Complex feelings can coexist.", "I\u2019m trying not to be too hard on this commenter because I suspect they\u2019re projecting their own trauma onto this situation, but on the other hand they\u2019re just being so unfeelingly callous towards OP and his son (and daughter).", "Completely, I think you\u2019re doing a good job of being empathetic to both them and the situation in the original post. Have a good week <3", "Thanks, it can be a little too easy to just judge people on the internet harshly lol. It\u2019s something I try to avoid doing because we\u2019re all human and fallible.
