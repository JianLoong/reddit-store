I'm sorry for this tough time. High five for being a supportive parent to your son. It sounds like he really needed you.", "NTA.\n\nYour son deserves to know that he has someone in his corner, especially if his maternal relatives feel the same way about him as your wife.\n\nSitting with him at the funeral doesn't mean that you were choosing him over your wife; it means that you love your son.", "NTA, you're brave, supportive and loving. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA - of course you\u2019re not. You were ready to divorce your wife over this, so who gives AF what her family thinks.", "NTA - you supported your son through a tough time losing his mom and having to go to her funeral.", "NTA - pretty sure God doesn\u2019t like bigots either.", "NTA - You did not choose anyone over your wife, you chose to support your son who had just lost his mother. While I respect her family is grieving, you owe them nothing and did nothing wrong here. If I were you , I would avoid them going forward. I lost my husband a few years ago and while I was blessed with supportive in-laws for the most part, there were a few who I choose to disengage from as much as possible. Just because we have a shared grief does not make me obligated to allow them to be an active part of my life, and you aren't obligated in any way to your in-laws either.", "NTA and maybe this is the last you get to hear from them. Even if you went with the divorce, it wouldn't have been any different. At least now you don't have to deal with any of them. When a parent fails a child for whatever reason, its the parent's failure and not that of the child. Well done on being there with your son who otherwise would have been alone.", "NTA. You are a hero! Your stayed with your wife and put the divorce on hold to help her. Once that was over, you rightfully put your son first. He will never forget that you stood up for him. You were a great husband and you are a great father.\n\nI'm sorry for you loss. It must be very difficult to lose someone you loved under such circumstances.", "NTA\nIt seems the problems you had with your wife prior to her death were here doing, not yours. Sitting with and supporting your son who's just lost his mother was the right thing to do. Your wife's family are AHs, you are a good Dad", "NTA. Appeasing bigots is always wrong, *especially* if it's against your own child. You're doing the right thing, even if the disgusting bigots in your family won't see that.", "NTA. You supported your son from a family that\u2019s turned against him for his sexuality. You should be proud of what you did, that\u2019s great parenting.\n\nThere\u2019s no world where you\u2019re the asshole here.", "NTA - You\u2019re an absolutely brilliant father, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nYour son is going to remember this moment for the rest of his life, and that you stood up for him against your wife\u2019s bigoted family. Keep it up.", "Hell no! NTA! NTA!\n\nThose family members can get bent. Although, since you were planning on divorcing her, you probably weren't going to be seeing much of them anyway.", "NTA- you were still legally married to your wife so YOU get to have a say at her funeral and nobody else .\n\nYou should have invited her Brother to leave if he\u2019s so mad about it.\n\nYou\u2019re not a disgrace , they are. \n\nThank you for standing up for your son.", "NTA and why the fuck are you even still talking to those horrible people?", "NTA. Your son was a truly gracious for attending and trying to show respect for his mother, who didn\u2019t return the courtesy.  \n\nHer family should all be ashamed of themselves.  I cannot fathom treating the son of the deceased that way,  and of course he is also their grandson, nephew etc.\n\nI hope with her passing you can close that horrible chapter in your life and have no contact with them anymore, there\u2019s no reason", "First I am so sorry for your loss.  Even if you weren\u2019t happy with your wife and her choices, you stood by her, have had a horrible few years an it sucks watching someone die from cancer.  \n\nWhy in the hell would her family have anything to say or do with the funeral?   She was technically still your wife, therefore you and your children should have planned the funeral.    You were not wrong.  Relatives that are not supportive during a funeral can be dismissed with prejudice.  I understand they are also going through their own grief, but that doesn\u2019t give them the right to berate and belittle.\n\nHow the heck did you choose your son over your wife?   Your wife is dead.  Your son has so many emotions right now, probably the biggest being that he will never resolve things with his mom.  How is your daughter doing through all this?\n\nYour choices are simple now.  Anyone who wants to continue with this \u201cyou are horrible/son is horrible/your wife was a saint\u201d or whatever version they spew . . .   \u201cI have nothing to say to you and do not want to hear from you again.\u201d   Hang up on them, have their emails go directly to junk.  If they approach you, your hand held up with palm facing them is a pretty universal signal to keep your mouth shut.   Then turn around and walk away.", "I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nNTA - I hope you and your son can lean on each other as you both go through the grief of losing someone close to you. \n\nI've found it is a weird mix of emotions when you love someone yet disagree with their actions or choices and then they pass. Please take the time to process and acknowledge emotions - both in you and your grown kids.", "NTA. Thank you for being there for your son! I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You\u2019re well shod of these terrible bigots. Good luck to you and your son.", "Funerals are for the bereaved. She was your son's mother and he was likely grieving even though it was a difficult relationship. She had no further needs you could meet, and he needed love and support.\n\nI cannot imagine a less AH way to handle that situation. NTA.", "NTA. Damn, never thought I'd root for the cancer. You did the right thing. You sat with your family.", "Nta. Fuck those people. Thankfully you don't have to deal with them anymore and I wouldn't.  That's a terrible way to treat your son", "NTA, you stood up as a Father to support his son during a time of loss. Your son will never forget this.", "NTA, you are a loving and supportive father!!!", "NTA. Your son needs your support, you did well by staying next to him during the service. You made the right choice and showed the right path with your actions.", "NTA. Might I say they can go F**k themselves. May you live long with the laughter of you\u2019re grandchildren in you\u2019re ears. PS wife\u2019s family should be happy they got an invite to the funeral.", "You\u2019re not an asshole, you\u2019re a saint. Good on you for supporting your son, and letting their hatefulness roll off your back. And I assume there\u2019s no reason to continue interacting or corresponding with them at this point, so no great loss there.", "NTA thank you for supporting your son!", "NTA- Don't the wedding vows say until death do us part?  You are parted now, there is no reason to deal with her family anymore. Tell them to go fuck themselves you have a son who needs you now.", "NTA \nAlways choose your children over other people.\nWho do you want to spent your time with? Those people who are uptight, or your son who has been there even when his mother pushed him away?", "NTA, and look, not only your wife's family is a major AH, but it seems to me that she was also, you are a good guy suffering just because you are treating your son the right way and not being bigoted", "NTA.  And if, now that your wife has passed on, you don't see a future where you have anything to do with your inlaws anymore you could always drop the \"I was going to divorce her but chose to be there for her through the cancer\" thing on them to let them know just what you actually thought of the way she and they treated of your son.  They'll hate you, but then again it sounds like they don't like you much anyway.", "OMG.\n\nNTA\n\nSo now that she passed , hopefully you can rebuild a relationship with your son. Im sure you need each other\u2019s support now. Who cares what the in law family feels. You were about to divorce her, they\u2019re behavior towards you would be no different and honestly you actually don\u2019t ever have to speak to them again. Protect your son, that is the relationship that matters\nJust play it back in your head. Her family wanted you to shun YOUR child in remembrance of how his mother horribly treated him and you asserted yourself and said NO. You did the only right thing. May you guys heal", "NTA, I hope your daughter is more like you then that side of the family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
