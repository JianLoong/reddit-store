I say \"you're okay\" so much to my 7 month old daughter or my 3 year old son that my son will go up to my daughter and be like \"you're okay baby\". He walks around patting his baby doll saying that, he also always makes sure to say \"I'm okay!\" if he falls or something. I'm sure I tell my kids they're okay (or fine) hundreds of times a month for reasons ranging from them just being grumpy or crying to them getting a little hurt.", "His son crying got to him because he knows better than to think a one year old can wait to eat. \n\nHe totally overreacted and blamed you for taking time to get dressed when it was t just you. \n\nAlso, parents of a one year old should know to feed him before you go out. They simply can\u2019t wait without a melt down. \n\nNTA", "NTA The baby is unlikely to have even understood you.  \nI have a one year old and the thing that stood out  to me in your story is that they didn't immediately try to feed the baby if he was evidently crying due to hunger. One year olds have zero ability to self regulate and being hungry is one of the big triggers. I wonder why the solution attempted was to drive him around.  \nThat said, in the future it's important to not impose outside opinions on people's feelings. Your nephew at that moment wasn't fine, he was hungry, and feeling bad about that is legitimate.", "When my first child was in daycare, there was a magic Bulgarian woman there who could calm any baby down. She ran the infant room, and she had them all in the palm of her hand. When one of them would start fussing, she would always say, \"Shh shh \\[baby name\\], you are fine.\" It worked a shocking amount of the time. Obviously if a baby needs something, they will keep crying until they get it, but being soothed and told they are ok was a very effective first step. I learned a TON about babies from her. NTA", "NTA I don't particularly like it when people say things like that to my 1yr baby to quieten him either because that's the only way he knows how to communicate his feelings. You weren't trying to get him to shut up though, you just said something nice and calming. Your brother is on a power trip.", "There is weight in not telling a child how they feel - ie not saying \"you're ok! You're fine!\" when they're crying or hurt themselves, but at 1 it won't cause any harm.", "NTA (only based on what's presented here).\n\nBut I have to say, your story doesn't really add up. New parents can be extremely sensitive about everything and everyone around their kids, but in this case there seems to be more going on. Your brother seems to have taken quite an issue with what was said (and more likely how it was said).", "NTA, whenever my kids fell as small children I\u2019d always do a variation of \u201c oh, you lucky thing, that was nearly a really big fall\u201d as I loved them up and it always had a calming effect. The Mrs would start screeching and looking for injuries and treated it as a crisis. So did the kids.", "How is that poor baby going to learn to regulate his own emotions and self soothe watching his primary caregivers have meltdowns over nothing? Stay away from these people, they sound unhinged, that poor kid.", "Modern [advice](https://www.famly.co/blog/youre-okay-children-self-regulation) is not to say \"you're fine\" or variations thereof to a hurting child. NTA because you didn't know that.\n\nYour brother likely had that on his mind and was stressed because of general parenthood and the specific crying and so lashed out when you said it. He was wrong to do so, especially when the child is only 1 and he's never explained the above to you before.", "I\u2019m going to hedge my judgment by saying that IF the story is accurate just as you told it, then NTA.  Infants and toddlers pick up on voice tones more than the actual words.  \n\nIf your brother had a problem with just the words that you spoke then he is definitely the stressed out AH here. \n\nHowever, as we all know, nobody tells the story as it *actually* happened.  At best, we tell it as *we remember it.*.  Is it possible that your tone was not as soothing as you remember it?", "This is basically a YTA, but only because it sounds like you don't really get how to emotionally relate to kids yet. It is not a good thing to invalidate a kid's feelings. If the kid is crying then in their mind, they're not fine. So telling a kid who's too young to understand reason and logic that they're fine, when in their mind they're not fine, is emotionally invalidating and can make you an unsafe person in the future. The better response for emotional regulation should have nothing to do with how the kid crying makes you, as an adult feel. Instead, neutral things like \"oh are you hungry and uncomfortable? I bet. I know it's so hard to be in the car. We'll get some food soon.\" (Etc)\n\nWhen the kid is pre-verbal guesses about what they're feeling and reassurance that what they're feeling is normal and that their needs will be met soon are good.", "Dude is freaking out, I've seen desperate parents do some weird stuff to get their kid to stop crying, but taking them for a ride around the block is new.\n\nIMO, what you did was far more likely to succeed than the drive. I would need the full story if bro told me you disrespected a 1yo, like how?\n\nNTA. Soothing words to a baby are what you're supposed to do.

Too bad the big human is a d*ck.", "NTA \n\nYour brother sounds insufferable \n\nI say 'you're fine' to my nephew all the time when hes crying or being dramatic (he is 3). Its not meant with malice and he's never actually hurt or anything.", "nta", "NTA.\n\nMy daughter has moments when all she does is cry, I rock her and tell her she\u2019s okay. \n\nBabies feed off energies, if I\u2019m freaking out she\u2019s going to freak out more.

I say that all the time to babies, because they *are* fine. Whatever issue there is, it\u2019s temporary and itll be sorted within 5-10 minutes, they really are fine. You didnt do anything wrong and it sounds like your brother has major anger issues.", "you did nothing wrong. he overreacted, is what i would say, but you did nothing NTA", "NTA, he clearly misunderstood your innocent phrase, and I do think that would have helped the poor kid a lot more than being driven around by his maniac father!", "NTA. The best way to help a baby calm down is to remain calm and let them know they're OK. We often would tell our LO that she was ok/she was alright when she was upset. It didn't mean we were taking away from her sadness, but we aren't going to go up to the baby and cry back in its face. That isn't going to help.", "NTA\n\nbut wtf? i had asked him what else should you had told his son? - \"you are so sick you are gona die?\"", "Lmao your brother thinks his baby is the universe to everyone. I would have had block him the moment he started screaming. Good riddance honestly", "NTA.  It sounds like dad is stressed out and it really upsets him when his son cries.  Everyone should have gotten up earlier if dad wanted son\u2019s breakfast to be at the normal time.  We\u2019ve had the same thing happen when we were traveling with other family.  They didn\u2019t understand why we insisted on certain times for meals or would give the kids snacks before a meal if we were running late.  Small children don\u2019t have the ability to wait and understand that they will be fed, it\u2019s just the food isn\u2019t ready yet or everyone needs to leave together.  Kids cry when they are uncomfortable (hungry).  They don\u2019t know how else to handle it.  \n\nAlso, \u201cyou\u2019re fine\u201d is similar to my \u201cit\u2019s ok\u201d.   Mine means it\u2019s ok to cry because you\u2019re upset, but it won\u2019t always be like this.  It will be ok.  It annoys my husband too.  Either he thinks you aren\u2019t validating his sons feelings or crying isn\u2019t appropriate for what happened.", "Your brother needs some help  nta", "NTA. He was fine. Just hungry.", "NTA, I tell my daughter \u201cit\u2019s okay, you\u2019re fine\u201d probably every day at some point. \n\nHaving a baby cry is very very very stressful. Me and my wife snap at each other the most when the baby is sick and crying all the time.\n\nHopefully the bro will calm down. Him carrying the anger more than a day later is not normal.", "NTA\n\nSome people don\u2019t like saying \u201cyou\u2019re fine\u201d to crying kids because maybe they\u2019re hurt or upset and you\u2019re telling them to ignore their own body/feelings. But the kid is a literal baby, and you were trying to soothe him. He IS fine.\n\nAnd if your brother\u2019s reaction to you doing something he doesn\u2019t like is to drive in a way that is dangerous, especially considering that HIS BABY IS IN THE CAR. Then he has got a MUCH bigger issue.", "NTA because your brother was bang out of line in how he handled it - but while it doesn't matter when he's this young, a better habit would be to use language like \"I'm here\" or \"Its okay to have a cry\" - just because \"You're fine\" can confuse or discourage kids from verbalising their needs", "ESH. Whether he's one year old or not, he has his own feelings and those are valid.  Who tf are you to decide for him that it's not okay for him to feel that way?  Your intent may have been to comfort, but the actual words you said were not 'everything will be okay'  instead you said the dismissive 'You're fine'.  That's the same as telling an injured child to 'walk it off'.  A one-time event at this age is hardly going to make a difference, so your brother is going too far with his drama, but he is not technically wrong that you crossed a line.", "Ha - thank you for your reply. Yes, they are new parents and tend to overreact anytime the child cries. They say if he crying something must be wrong. Which is not completely wrong\u2026 but I am definitely of the mindset that a 1 year old can also cry just to cry.", "I think you hit it spot on. Thank you for your reply. I have been thinking that lately! That I actually feel bad for him. How hard it must be to spit ugly words and thoughts about everyone all the time. I hope he can check his behavior before his son gets older and recognizes his toxicity, or even worse, follows in his fathers footsteps. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with it too, but a bit comforting that we are not alone! \n\nThank you, I wish you the best as well \u2764\ufe0f", "The manic driving is a anger issue red flag. His baby was in that car...", "Thank you for your reply. He ate a muffin that morning, so I am not even sure if he was crying because he was hungry, as much as he was crying just because he was bored, tired, or just being a one year old baby and doing what one year old babies do. My brother claims it was because he was hungry, but he did have breakfast that morning.", "Thank you for you response. The story truly is presented in an honest way. This happens a couple of months ago and I have not been able to stop thinking about it. \n\nHe says that his wife told my mom & I to \u201cgo ahead and get ready\u201d but she was getting ready with us the whole time. I think she definitely stirred things up. They are new parents and extremely sensitive to everything. \n\nOn the same trip - he crawled over and started playing with an electrical outlet. I instinctively told him \u201cno\u201d in also a very calm almost playful way, and picked him up to get him away from the electrical outlet, and he blew up on me about that, and told me to never tell his son \u201cno\u201d. \n\nAs I said, we have never really gotten along for whatever reason. I think he may have some mental problems that go beyond our relationship.", "My kid was falling like a dozens of times an hour when he was one (he wanted to run when he didn't even know to walk, and he  sure didn't know to sit down once up so he simply let himself fall down). It was at a point, random people in my neighborhood jokingly told me they would certify that neither we (the parents) nor the nanny were roughing him up if CPS ever got involved.\n\nIt was such a common occurrence, and since he was almost never really injured, that nobody would worry anymore, and it even was mostly funny. So when he fell, almost all the regulars at the playground would just spontaneously laugh. Even now, he almost never cry when he falls. It's really reassuring: he only cries when he's hurt, so we know to immediately rush to him.", "Thank you for your response. I totally understand that there are two sides to every story, but I definitely would not talk to my nephew who I love very much in a tone that was \u201cmean\u201d or \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. I truly said it in a way that most people would when trying to soothe a crying baby.", "That doesn\u2019t make OP an asshole. People who don\u2019t have kids or work with kids generally don\u2019t keep up with the ever changing latest parenting advice.\n\nThe brother could have explained it nicely like you did, but he chose to overreact.", "Babies and kids really take after their parents emotions. If the parents are nervous, the kid gets nervous too, as they sense something must be off. They don't understand it is them that is causing it. Kids cry all the time, this is what they know how to do and every small thing that occours is the worst thing that has happened on their life. That's just how kids are. It is the parents job to teach the child and help them to calm down, usually by offering support and safety (plus food and what ever they physically need).", "I thought that at first with my little brother. He was my sisters kid that I raised with my parents after she decided she didn\u2019t want a kid. After helping to raise 3 kids for her I\u2019ve realized that just like adults kids sometimes just need to have a good cry.", "NTA\n\nI have kids, and I'll just add a small nuance: 1 year old cry not just to cry, but because they need to cry (and want/need to be reassured just like you did). \n\nSmall tips: I use the future tense for this \"You're gonna be fine\", as to not deny the child's feelings of not being OK but still reassuring them that all is fine.", "Well.if it was because he was hungry, that doubles your brother's foolishness: when has being driven around in a car ever satiated anyone's hunger? Babies can get hungry again, pretty quickly, so a muffin for breakfast might have been first breakfast...", "Didn't you say they were sick?", "Not doubting you, OP. Just felt that the story needed more context and your reply provides that.\n\nFrom my expedience, if you have a strained relationship with the parents, it can be difficult to have a neutral!/ positive equation with their kids. There's nothing much you can do to improve the situation unless things change between you and your brother. Don't dwell on this, and definitely don't feel guilty. If it all went down the way you have described it, you are certainly NTA and do not deserve to be treated this way.", "*well I guess next time your nephew is unattended and playing with something dangerous, you're not allowed to stop them* (I'm exaggerating) \n\nI work with a 2 yo and one of the first things I learned is that you're not supposed to say \"no\" when they're doing something \"wrong\" because they'll develop a sort of attraction to whatever's forbidden. But I was taught with calmness and reason, because my first instinct when I see a kid doing something dangerous is to say \"no\" to stop them. Now I don't do it anymore, because I understand the reason behind it. \n\nIt was wrong and rude of your brother to yell at you, because even though *he*'s a parent and he's definitely stressed, and has a responsibility to raise his child (as well as the right to do it how he sees fit), *you* are not a parent, nor a nanny, nor a kindergarten teacher, and you are not required to *know* how to educate a child. You acted on the basic instinct to protect your nephew from something dangerous, and that's what your brother should have recognised and thanked you for, instead of yelling at you because you didn't consider the educational consequences of the way you interacted with your nephew.\n\nIf I were you I would calmly but firmly confront your brother, telling him that he's acting like an asshole. Being a stressed parent is not an excuse for behaving like this, also I would remind him that everyone else around him isn't required to just *know* how he's educating his child if he doesn't explicitly say it.", "So ultimately NTA, OP. Your brother has DEFINITELY overreacted.   \n\n\nHowever, I think he was mostly reacting to saying \"you're fine\" as a way to comfort the baby. Now, as a baby, he doesn't understand what you're saying. But saying \"you're fine\" to children is generally a way of getting them to be quiet without actually addressing the emotions they may be feeling; a way of silencing them. I 100% am not saying that's what you were trying to do, but I'm just saying that it seems like he was responding to that (again, he definitely overreacted and could have been much calmer about everything). I also recognize that kids emotions can be all over the place, but I don't think that makes them any less valid.", "That\u2019s good to hear.  \ud83d\udc4d", "There is a school of thinking with some millennial parents that you shouldn't negate a baby's feelings by saying they are \"fine\" and similar things. No, I am not kidding.", "Thank you! & thank you for stepping up and taking care of those kiddos. You must mean the world to them.", "Op said op was sick by the end. Probably from dealing with their piece of work brother.", "which ultimately is\u2026 fine\u2026 but it should be obvious to anyone implementing ANY kind of method that people don\u2019t just automatically know that. if they think it \u201cnegates babies feelings,\u201d whether it makes sense or not, just\u2026 communicate it. ultimately as long as it doesn\u2019t do more harm than good i\u2019m down with whatever, but I hate when parents have a certain rule, like \u201cnever use the word no\u201d or something, and act as if entire world was supposed to know that.", "They mean the world to me.", "Exactly, so many things might be \"obvious\" to people experienced with babies, or even if they are just learning about them, but this knowledge is not common sense!", "There is a big difference between gentle, soothing words to a baby, and dismissing a child's feelings.  You were doing the first.  I've seen the second and it's sad, like a kid describing something scary to me and the parent saying \"she's fine, she's not scared\" and you see the kids face realize she can't express fears in front of mom... That sucks.  You were NTA.  If brother flys off the handle screaming all the time I would bet poor baby is extra stressed out and needs gentle soothing to show him the world is ok and not terrifying like dad", "NTA because your brother's reaction was incredibly disproportionate. That said, I don't like when people say \"you're fine\" in response to a kid being upset, because it _is_ a form of dismissing their legitimate feelings. \"You'll be okay\" is a good substitute IMO. But it's totally understandable that you'd say \"you're fine,\" and your brother should have addressed the issue differently (e.g. \"We're trying to use language that affirms our kid's feelings, so in the future please don't say he's fine when he's crying. Here's some things we like to say instead.\").", "NTA\n\nHe was fine. Babies don\u2019t know when they are fine and they respond to the emotional environment of the room.", "NTA and I think he felt incompetent as he could not calm his child down. He's delusional", "NTA\n\nTo a baby, every new bad thing is the worst thing they've ever felt. They don't know how to regulate their emotions and need someone calm who can regulate to help them figure out they are actually okay.", "Esh, ill take my downvotes. Mom of two i did correct how people spoke to my kids when small so they started a good habit for when it mattered. At this age doesnt matter but you don\u2019t want to form a habit of that. Now the baby being hungry and sick of course its not fine to the baby.\n\nNow your brother overreacted. He could have told you calmly that they acknowledged their kid\u2019s feelings. That they are starting now to get the habit of it.", "NTA by any stretch! We always tell my toddler nephews \u201cyou\u2019re fine\u201d when they\u2019re upset before talking to them about why they\u2019re upset. It\u2019s a gentle reminder that, \u201chey, I know you have big feelings right now, but you\u2019re safe and loved.\u201d We\u2019ve been doing it since they were born and I have never heard anyone (their parents or any of the overly babying adult friends) complain about it.", "Your brother sounds an awful lot like my sister. She\u2019s always been difficult to deal with but since having my nephew (also 1) she has also turned into a complete \u201ctyrant\u201d (I can think of other words I would use to describe her but they\u2019d probably get me banned). \n\nI don\u2019t have kids but I do believe babies cry because it\u2019s the only way they can really express themselves. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there is something wrong it\u2019s just their way of communicating. Your brother being a stress head and driving like a maniac would make anyone uneasy let alone a one year old baby who can\u2019t grasp what\u2019s happening. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA. A one year old who (I\u2019m assuming) can\u2019t talk yet doesn\u2019t know what the words \u201cyou\u2019re fine\u201d mean let alone be able to feel disrespected by it, but he does understand your tone and if you were gentle and soothing with him you did exactly what I would have done if I were in your position. Your brother sounds like a terror which is a shame because the only person he\u2019s hurting is his son who may not be able to have a close behaviour with his aunt/uncle as a result.", "New parent are so funny!  They freak over the littlest things.  Don\u2019t take it too hard.", "NTA.\n\nIf anything made the situation worse for your nephew, it's your brother's anger. Telling the baby he's fine in a gentle voice is in no way harmful or \"disrespectful.\"", "NTA. were the baby not a baby but a 10 year old then you could argue that it\u2019s not great to say \u201cyou\u2019re fine\u201d when they\u2019re upset. But babies don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. They would hear the soothing tone in your voice. Your brother is totally overreacting and sounds like he\u2019s not really upset about this. He sounds very stressed. \n\nMaybe try not to take it personally and ask if he\u2019s okay.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nAs someone with an almost two year old son, they cry when the wind shifts direction. Like, obviously if he is hungry he is going to cry until it gets rectified because that is really their only form of communication. \n\nSpeaking to them calmly, soothingly and adult-like generally helps them, not just now but as they get older as well. It sounds like you need to have a conversation with your brother and if he doesn't listen say good bye. You don't deserve to be treated like that.", "NTA. Your brother is unhinged", "NTA - The baby is fine, your brother is not\u2026", "I tell my similarly aged son he's fine when he's crying a lot. Little ones cry a lot, and most of the time it isn't anything bad, they're just unhappy and can't express themselves any other way. Nta", "NTA go home and in the future skip traveling together with  your brother of going on any vacations with him. \n\nHonestly with babies you just have a word river as you try to comfort and entertain them. I doubt most people are aware of the things they say to them half the time. Things like \u201csmooshed banana yum yum yum do you want some more sweet boy? Nummy. In your mouth silly, there you go\u2026. Yummy banana!\u201d that kind of crap.  How else do you explain grown adults explaining to a baby step by step instructions as they make a bottle or change a diaper? I think sleep deprivation is a major factor. \ud83d\ude09\n\nYour brother is a powder keg waiting to go off; stand clear.", "NTA. Your comment was innocuous (also, the baby doesn\u2019t understand it, I said this to my kid all the time). His reaction was also sort of normal. Hearing your baby cry is stressful in and of itself and a lot of parents struggle to stay civil in this situation. \n\nA quick apology after the fact by your brother should have been enough to take care of it and move on. Instead\u2026 he\u2019s gone the complete other direction.", "Yea, I'm surprised how no one else mentioned this. It definitely could cause harm at 1, but it would take someone closer to the baby saying it often. That baby understands what's going on. \n\nBut an uncle that doesn't see the baby often isn't going to make an impression. Still though, not a good habit from OP. And a massive overreaction from the dad", "Instead of \"you're fine\" try \"your feelings are valid\" or \"I know\" and never ever go to \"don't cry\". \n\nBut nta and bro has issues expressing himself productively... exactly what you want to help the baby avoid...", "I have three kids and sometimes kids just cry. The best advice I ever received was from my dad. He said if they are feed, burped, and have a clean bottom then they are just crying because they are tired or want to cry. My oldest was a nightmare when it came to crying and sometimes I would have her completely take care of and she would still scream. So I would put her down in her bed and let her cry while I sat on the floor and cried with her.", "Did they just adopt your nephew or something? Because if he is their biological kid...it has been a year...they are not new parents. They have been parents far to long for him having this reaction to crying to be understandable", "So here\u2019s the thing it\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter now because the child doesn\u2019t understand your words but you need to get out of the habit of using that specific phrase as it is dismissive as fuck. It\u2019s not up to the adults to tell a child how they are feeling if they are ok or not. A simple adjustment is \u201cyou\u2019ll be alright\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re safe\u201d. \n\nNAH your brother isn\u2019t wrong that it\u2019s not a good phrase to use with children but you weren\u2019t wrong for not knowing what else to say.", "I work at a daycare we have a one year old cry everytime the room door opens. Sometimes they are overdramatic", "Yeah, babies are basically Hobbits when it comes to meal times... Especially if they're gearing up for a growth spurt. That's how my mom always knew to wash the next size up in clothes and stock up on diapers (as needed) when we were really little. We'd suddenly turn into fussy bottomless pits who had to eat 24/7 or we'd scream the house down. A week later, it would stop and we would need new clothes \ud83e\udd23", "OP needs to read this!", "So do you believe babies cry for no reason?"]}
