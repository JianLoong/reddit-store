We live in the lower unit and rent out the upper.\n\nLast fall, a new couple (late 30s/early 40s) moved in. They were...fine. We learned that they were very particular (e.g., weren't comfortable with us coming in to do repairs unless they were there, requested that we look at non-issues such as minor temperature amplifications in the gas oven), which we accommodated without complaint because they were taking good care of the space.\n\nThings seemed to sour this summer when they presumed that they could put plants in our backyard. The yard is professionally landscaped and decorated; it\u2019s something I take great pride in. We also have a dog and young child who run around and are taking an interest in breaking\u2026everything. For these reasons, we had explicitly stated in their lease that they could not leave personal belongings back there, though we have always welcomed them using the space to gather and even offered to install window planter boxes for them.\n\nA few weeks later, they reached out to say that they had found a new apartment and would be moving out a month later (which is a mid-month date...somewhat relevant later on). This translated to moving out with 3.5 months left of their lease. We relisted the apartment that day and had multiple showings scheduled for the next weekend day. \n\nWe found a new tenant to move in 6 weeks after the current tenants plan to move out. We had only one person reach out for an earlier move-in date, and they did not move forward with scheduling a showing.\n\nThe existing tenants seem absolutely shocked that we: 1) expect them to continue paying their rent for the 6 weeks between when they move out and the new tenants / lease kicks in; 2) did not do something more to find someone who could move in sooner. They\u2019ve sent some choice emails and obviously things are chilly when we run into each other.\n\nWe feel that we made a very real effort to get the unit re-filled as quickly as possible (as is our legal obligation) and that beyond that, it is not on us to eat the cost of their decision. This is how fixed-term leases work, and pretty much anyone who has decided to break a lease has had to pay the (literal) price. They could have and should have budgeted for this when they decided to move early. \n\nBut I also have moments where I worry we\u2019re just being, well, AHs...AITA?", "created_utc": 1689039013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wcvnf/aita_for_holding_our_tenants_to_their_lease/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You still owe the mortgage, insurance,  and taxes. They left before the lease was up, so they owe the money. You did due diligence in finding someone to fill in after 6 weeks.", "NTA I\u2019ve been a renter and shared my space with others as a roommate. They are lucky you\u2019re not making them pay all 3.5 months worth of rent that is fully within your right. \n\nRegardless of the yard thing you offered other accommodations, they declined and now trying to make you the bad guy because you enforced the rules of a lease THEY signed?? Wack", "NTA because a lease is a lease. They should be glad that you are not charging them the full 3.5 months of rent they owe.", "They're moving because they're mad they didn't read their contract. You're now surprised that they're mad because they didn't read their contract? They can find someone else to take over the lease if they have an issue with it.

Every renter knows that you have to keep paying rent until the end of the contract or until the property owners can get new tenants in\u2026. It\u2019s not a new thing! They should have read their lease agreement and factored it into their decision!", "NTAs.  A lease is a lease.", "NTA. They should be aware of their lease agreement.", "NTA at all. They should be happy they\u2019re only on the hook for six weeks instead of 3.5 months.", "NTA if they move out before the lease is up they still need to pay the rest of the rent. That's not your problem", "NTA in all my leases. It states that the tenant/s will pay the rent remaining on the lease if the tenant chooses to break the lease early to xx/xx/xxxx..\nExceptions are made for military personnel.", "I think much of this is legal stuff that matters on the local laws and is out of the scope of this subreddit. But I will ask about what could be in scope. How clear did you make it to both the current tenants and future tenants that the yard could not be modified? I ask because I've had the experience where the lease I signed stated no such restrictions about placing personal items on the patio, only to discover several months after buying a single patio chair that it was forbidden to have any non-plant personal items in the patio area (per an earlier version of the lease that most other tenants had signed) and that if I wanted patio furniture I had to rent it from the leasing office and that I also couldn't do that either because the patio furniture tended to never be returned when tenants moved out and therefore the leasing office had no spare sets of patio chairs or tables. This explained a few things I noticed, like the oddly identical patio sets other tenants had (I think the reason I went so long without being reprimanded over my patio chair was because I bought a style and color similar to what the other tenants had, and it wasn't until they went through their records that they realized my chair didn't belong to them. Also that chair was super useful: for placing groceries while unlocking the door, and I resented having not being able to use it so frequently), and that this explained also the absurdly large tree-like potted plants that a few tenants crammed into their patios.\n\n\nThe point is, how clear was it before move-in that this space had restrictions on use? Was it just in the lease and not mentioned verbally? I feel that there is also a difference between warning them that it is unwise to leave out things that can be destroyed and that there's no garantee for the safety of the plants and personal items (and to still allowing them to leave out potted plants and personal items) vs forbidding them from it.", "This might be better posted in a landlord tenant subreddit", "YTA\n\nThey are leaving a bad landlord situation. \n\nIt's pathetic to expect tenants who have moved out to pay for something they aren't using anymore.

Would your contract be unreasonable to a big apartment complex? No. Those places have you pay the rest of the lease term if you leave early without legitimate excuses (military orders, medical reasons, etc). You cannot control new tenants and how early they can move in and take over. They sound like they weren\u2019t thinking things through and wanted it to be their way or the highway. That\u2019s a them problem. I\u2019d be firm in making them pay and prepare to take legal action if they refuse.", "NTA. They agreed to a contract and must abide by the terms of that contract. The fact that this contract is a lease seems to be distracting people. \nPrepare for things to get worse and for you to possibly require legal representation. \nOn a separate note; the amount of people who fancy themselves communists/socialists or wantabes but have never lived under the auspices of a socialist regime, well they will forever be hilarious.", "NTA since as you stated you fulfilled your legal duty to mitigate your damages by finding a replacement tenant.\n\nETA: for those comments stating \u201cthey\u2019re lucky you aren\u2019t charging them for the full term\u2026\u201d that is actually a violation of landlord tenant law in most places (in the US at least).  The landlord must try to fill the unit to reduce the vacant period.", "NTA. A lease is a legal agreement with a start and end date. They are responsible for the rent until expiration or until,the date a new tenant takes over. The only exception is if you choose to do work to the apartment that couldn\u2019t be done with someone living there. I am a property manager and I write that into my leases now.", "Yea. OP is NTA for this one very specific thing, but it really sounds like they have no business renting anything out. Can\u2019t  imagine why the tenants want out.", ">They are leaving a bad landlord situation.\n\n\nLol, no they aren't. \nThey are leaving cos they did not read the details of their contract which is fine. They made the right decision for themselves. \n\n\n>It's pathetic to expect tenants who have moved out to pay for something they aren't using anymore. Broken lease or not.\n\n\nWell, dem are the breaks where they live so...? Again, contracts are a thing", "You must not know how contracts work. I'll explain.\n\nSo basically you read this piece of paper and if you agree to the terms you sign it and are legally obligated to follow through. If you don't agree then you don't sign and go elsewhere then and there.\n\nIf you sign the paper and decide to break the terms of said contract the other party has every right to enforce said contract. \n\nHope this helped!", "Breaking a lease is bad, it has nothing to do with a landlord. \n\nThey are lucky he\u2019s not forcing them to pay the entirety of the remainder. They swore legally they would pay rent for a year and now their not. The fact you think a landlord is a problem proves you\u2019re just as irresponsible and entitled", "Found the shitty tenant.", "Lmfao \"dems the breaks\" bahahaha they can't actually enforce that. Literally anywhere. Landlord complains about having to do \"little\" things for them. Then won't allow them to have a garden because \"landscaping\" probably just a baren grass yard the husband loves the way hank hill loves his big grass yard.\n\n\nThese people are looking for SOMEONE ELSE to pay their mortgage FOR them.", "\"The law says he's right\" is irrelevant to the question of whether he's an asshole. He was a dick to them and they don't want to put up with him. Using a contract to make them pay him is an asshole move.", ">They are lucky he\u2019s not forcing them to pay the entirety of the remainder.\n\nI don't believe there is a single state that would allow a landlord to double dip.  If OP did this, then they couldn't rent it out until the end of the original lease.", "In a system where the laws are written to protect landlords at the expense of tenants, breaking a lease is not bad. The idea that you can't be an asshole if you have the law on your side is the very definition of entitlement.", "How exactly was he \" a dick to them\"?\n\nHe told them that they couldn't rework the back yard - which was a condition of renting the property that had been established up front, and that they agreed to when they signed.", "How in the world was OP a dick to them? Handled all of their complaints, even offered to install window planters so they could have the plants they wanted. They knew, or should have known they couldn't have personal items left in the back yard due to it being in the contract and they broke that agreement. All OP did was remind them what they agreed to lmao", "It\u2019s still a possibility he could make them pay it and not rent it out. However op seems to be doing his best to put in new tenants right away", "To protect them from people failing to uphold their end of an agreement \n\n\nYeah real shame", "I think your dictionary is broken. However, I do want to echo the sentiment that breaking a lease should not be viewed as bad. Life happens and it regularly doesn't happen on a convenient schedule that lines up with a lease term. Sometimes you just have to break a lease.\n\nThis doesn't mean it's a free action. There's always a fee involved because you are terminating an agreement early. The fee varies, sometimes it's a month of rent, sometimes it's the full remainder of the term or somewhere in between. I had to pay a month and a half worth of rent to break my lease when I moved in with my wife. My landlord even let me pay it off in installments over several months.\n\nThis honestly would have been a N A H situation if it wasn't for the reaction and attitude of the tenant. That's what lands it square in NTA territory.", "NTA \n\n>We learned that they were very particular (e.g., weren't comfortable with us coming in to do repairs unless they were there, requested that we look at non-issues such as minor temperature amplifications in the gas oven)\n\nBut lol.

Not wanting someone in your space, rented or not, when you aren\u2019t there is just bare minimum.", "NTA but what the fuck do the first 2 paragraphs have to do with anything?", "nta", "NTA you have a binding lease and you did what you could to get a new tenant asap. You also have to have time in between to do the maintenance for the next tenants. Clean paint shampoo carpets ect.", "Nope, this is why you have a lease. So everyone knows what\u2019s expected. NTA.", "NTA, heck when reading this I was fully expecting them to eat the 3.5 month lease cost which even then would not make you an AH, they had a lease and they broke it. \n\nSurely they have leased an apartment before and this is not news to them right?", "NTA.  They signed a legally binding contract.  The End.", "OP very likely has a legal obligation to try to rerent rather than charge them.", ">These people are looking for SOMEONE ELSE to pay their mortgage FOR them.\n\nWhy is that a bad thing? Any normal person would love to be in that situation.", "Yeah such a dick getting them to follow the contract they read and signed and nothing more.\n\nHe should just let them completely ignore the contract that they knowingly signed and shirk all responsibility for right?"]}
