We learned that they were very particular (e.g., weren't comfortable with us coming in to do repairs unless they were there, requested that we look at non-issues such as minor temperature amplifications in the gas oven), which we accommodated without complaint because they were taking good care of the space.\n\nThings seemed to sour this summer when they presumed that they could put plants in our backyard. The yard is professionally landscaped and decorated; it\u2019s something I take great pride in. We also have a dog and young child who run around and are taking an interest in breaking\u2026everything. For these reasons, we had explicitly stated in their lease that they could not leave personal belongings back there, though we have always welcomed them using the space to gather and even offered to install window planter boxes for them.\n\nA few weeks later, they reached out to say that they had found a new apartment and would be moving out a month later (which is a mid-month date...somewhat relevant later on). This translated to moving out with 3.5 months left of their lease. We relisted the apartment that day and had multiple showings scheduled for the next weekend day. \n\nWe found a new tenant to move in 6 weeks after the current tenants plan to move out. We had only one person reach out for an earlier move-in date, and they did not move forward with scheduling a showing.\n\nThe existing tenants seem absolutely shocked that we: 1) expect them to continue paying their rent for the 6 weeks between when they move out and the new tenants / lease kicks in; 2) did not do something more to find someone who could move in sooner. They\u2019ve sent some choice emails and obviously things are chilly when we run into each other.\n\nWe feel that we made a very real effort to get the unit re-filled as quickly as possible (as is our legal obligation) and that beyond that, it is not on us to eat the cost of their decision. This is how fixed-term leases work, and pretty much anyone who has decided to break a lease has had to pay the (literal) price.

But I will ask about what could be in scope. How clear did you make it to both the current tenants and future tenants that the yard could not be modified? I ask because I've had the experience where the lease I signed stated no such restrictions about placing personal items on the patio, only to discover several months after buying a single patio chair that it was forbidden to have any non-plant personal items in the patio area (per an earlier version of the lease that most other tenants had signed) and that if I wanted patio furniture I had to rent it from the leasing office and that I also couldn't do that either because the patio furniture tended to never be returned when tenants moved out and therefore the leasing office had no spare sets of patio chairs or tables. This explained a few things I noticed, like the oddly identical patio sets other tenants had (I think the reason I went so long without being reprimanded over my patio chair was because I bought a style and color similar to what the other tenants had, and it wasn't until they went through their records that they realized my chair didn't belong to them. Also that chair was super useful: for placing groceries while unlocking the door, and I resented having not being able to use it so frequently), and that this explained also the absurdly large tree-like potted plants that a few tenants crammed into their patios.\n\n\nThe point is, how clear was it before move-in that this space had restrictions on use? Was it just in the lease and not mentioned verbally? I feel that there is also a difference between warning them that it is unwise to leave out things that can be destroyed and that there's no garantee for the safety of the plants and personal items (and to still allowing them to leave out potted plants and personal items) vs forbidding them from it.\n\n\nEdit: ok, I recommend both you and your tenants should talk to lawyer. I don't think your lease is legal where I live, as the leases I've signed haven't stated that that tenant is responsible for more than one month if a new tenant couldn't be found (and indeed we didn't have to pay for any additional months), or have gotten around tenant protection laws by having a security deposit equal to one month's rent, which is then not returned if the tenant breaks the lease without one month's notice. Anyways, if your lease is legal where you are you may find that there are unexpected legal loopholes your tenants can take advantage of, such as the tenant may have the right to use taking those 6 weeks to very leasurely move from their current apartment to their new one, as they are afterall paying for it. That may be a problem for you if you want to pull up carpet or paint walls.", "This might be better posted in a landlord tenant subreddit", "YTA\n\nThey are leaving a bad landlord situation. \n\nIt's pathetic to expect tenants who have moved out to pay for something they aren't using anymore.

That's not feasble for most people. \n\nI worked in the apartment industry for over 25 years. Our maintenance department hours of operation were 9am to 4:30pm. We had a very specific list of problems we would respond to after hours as an emergency. As part of our maintenance request procedure residents had to check a box \"do we have permission to enter your apartment when you aren't home? Yes/No.\" Additionally there are many repairs that have to be done during the daytime because of visibility. If we had to wait for our residents to be home and present after their own jobs we'd have gotten very few maintenance requests accomplished. \n\nContrary to what many believe, your maintenance person isn't sitting around the shop drinking coffee and waiting for calls to come in. Everyday they come into work they are going to have a stack of work orders to get through. They are allotted a specific amount of time per type of call. For example, they can't get away with spending 90 minutes fixing a dripping kitchen faucet. They don't have time to go poking through your belongings and they probably aren't interested in your stuff anyway. If they've been on the job any length there's probably nothing in your apartment they haven't seen before.

Where I\u2019m located, I believe there are laws regarding not charging a tenant for a space once you begin making improvements. If they\u2019d stayed until the end of their lease, I assume you wouldn\u2019t have been able to fill it immediately; you\u2019d have needed at least a day or two to ensure it was ready for a new tenant, and probably a week or two.\n\nI agree with charging them a lease break fee, but make sure you\u2019re being fair with the amount you\u2019re charging.", "NTA.
