I won't get into details for privacy but we went through hell. For 2 years I had to be in the hospital all the time and my husband had to work 2 jobs to be able to pay for the hospital\n\nWe decided that the best thing to do for Jenny would be to send her to live with my MIL who lives in another city. She is the only close family we have. We were trying to give Jenny a normal life otherwise she would spend all her time in a hospital like us.\n\nNow that Tara is better, things are a lot better and we asked Jenny to come back home and she was glad to do so however she only ever spends time with her dad, never with me or Tara and she never says why she doesn't want to spend time with us. Not just that she also actively bullies Tara any chance she gets\n\nLast night her dad managed to convince her to go out to dinner with me. Tara and I got ready and we were waiting for Jenny. She came out of her room and saw us there, turned to my husband and said she changed her mind and went back to her room. I followed her and asked what's wrong. She started screaming at me asking me if I have to include Tara in everything. She accused me of not enjoying spending my time with her and \"bringing Tara so that I could spend time with Tara and pretend to like Jenny\" I told her this is not true and I was just trying to have a girls night with both of my daughters but she screamed at me to get out and called me an asshole and other names", "created_utc": 1676293865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1117vy2/aita_for_including_both_of_my_daughters/", "score": 1391, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

INFO: did you not see your daughter for 2 years while Tara was in the hospital?", "In this instance, YTA. Obviously Jenny shouldnt bully Tara, but shes 14 and she needs her mom too, and it sounds like you have had a lot of your focus on Tara. As shes 14, i bet she doesnt know how to articulate her needs, but in this case, it was quite obvious. She clearly expected it was a dinner between just the two of you so you shouldnt have included Tara.", "YTA, you need to rebuild your relationship you had with Jenny. Basically the message she got over the last 2 years is that you chose Tara. She resents Tara for that and blames you. Some family therapy, therapy Jenny individually and the girls together could be helpful", "INFO How long was Jenny living away from the nuclear family? Did anyone visit Jenny whilst she was at your MIL\u2019s?", "Jenny: I\u2019m finally gonna get a chance to talk to my mom one on one about the way I\u2019m feeling and why I lash out when she always makes me include my sister that I\u2019m resentful of.\n\nMom: We\u2019re bringing your sister!\n\nJenny: Asshole!!!\n\nMom: shocked pikachu face", "YTA. You have to be able to spend 1-on-1 time with Jenny or you're going to lose her. Tara got you, in person, for the last 2 years. She hasn't gotten you at all. She hasn't had a mom for 2 years. Tara has. \n\nAnd you decided that the one time she agrees to spend time with YOU, not Tara, not the whole family, YOU, was the perfect time to force her sister into the picture again? And prove exactly her point, that you don't care about Jenny without Tara but can care about Tara without Jenny?", "YTA. Soft YTA, but you have some work to do.\n\nTara basically got two years of your uninterrupted one on one time while Jenny got uprooted. Twice.\n\nTara got emotional support from you in a difficult time. Jenny got shipped to Grandma.\n\nYou did what you thought was best for your family in a really tough situation and I am not going to second guess you. If I would wish anything for a family in that tight spot, it is loving grandparents able to shelter anyone who needs it. But now you need to do some healing with Jenny.\n\nJenny also went through hard stuff, and she went through it without your support. She did middle school without her old friends, and now she gets to transition into high school without her new ones. She has spent some incredibly formative years away and if you are going to repair this relationship, you need to give her some dedicated space and attention. A dinner or activity with just the two of you once a week would be a good start. Girls night with both your girls is going to need to wait a while.\n\nIncidentally, the hospital may have social work resources available to your family even though the immediate health concern is resolved. Please ask.", "INFO: How long was Jenny with your in laws?", "INFO: Why would you even think of bringing Tara along if this was supposed to be a dinner about your relationship with Jenny?", "YTA \n\nYour daughter needs individual therapy, family therapy, and 1:1 time. For 2 years, she was sent away from the family. Come back, and everything still includes Tara. This dinner was presented as dinner with Mom. That\u2019s what she agreed to. Not dinner with Tara. This is your wake-up call.", "YTA \n\nI\u2019ve read your comments and you refuse to realise that you need to put in effort to rebuild your relationship with her individually.

Spend time with Jenny ALONE. Make her feel special. She\u2019s obviously hurt and resentful Tara got you alone for 2 years regardless of the reasons behind it. Family therapy is also indicated. She\u2019s crying out that she needs some TLC and you only thing about bonding with Tara when she obviously isn\u2019t ready for that.", "INFO: how did you & your husband explain to your then-12 year old daughter that you were going to send her to your MIL and never go visit her during those two years?", "YTA \"Out to dinner with me\"=/=\"Out to dinner with her sister and me.\" Bait and switch and then blame the victim of the deceit.  This is exactly why we can tell Jenny's assessment of your relationship is spot on. You are a self serving liar and she knows it. You sent her to the MIL because it was easier for you and no other reason.", "YTA. I know one daughter was sick, but you\u2019ve neglected mothering your other child and she is craving your love. You can\u2019t seem to give it to her unless your special child is there. At least that\u2019s how you\u2019re making it look to her.", "Being the sibling of a sick kid is extremely difficult. In Jenny\u2019s case, she was quite literally sent away so all focus could be on Tara. \n\nI say this delicately, but YTA for depriving your daughter of the one on one time she so desperately needs. Jenny is dealing with a lot of emotions right now. 14 is a tough age, but consider everything she went through while away from her family.", "After reading all the comments, YTA. You want to force a relationship on YOUR schedule. Jenny is not yet ready to be close to Tara. That doesnt mean Jenny should be able to bully Tara, but you are the ahole for insisting Tara come to a dinner that should have been about you reconnecting with Jenny.", "YTA. You need to put in INDIVIDUAL time with Jenny. Stop trying to force her to bond with Tara. All you're going to do is tear them apart further. Get family therapy, right now.\n\nTara got your undivided attention for 2 years and Jenny got ignored. You mention in a comment that you didn't/couldn't visit, but you \"called\". You abandoned Jenny. That's how she feels about it. It's now your job to repair the trust you lost with her.", "YTA.\n\nYou sent her AWAY. You did. You put everything into one daughter and the other was sent away without a thought.\n\nNow you expect her to be fine with you? With Tara? In her eyes Tara is the main reason why she didn't get a family for two years. How often did you visit? Spend time with Jenny when she was sent to a TOTALLY DIFFERENT CITY. The poor girl even had to switch schools for two years. \n\nYou abandoned one daughter for the other and now expects her to just be happy to spend time with y'all? It don't work like that. You AND Tara need to work on rebuilding a relationship with her. IF she even wants it. You cannot force it. She deserves the right to decide if she even wants it or not.\n\nI know Tara was sick and I'm glad she's okay now but you still abandoned your youngest daughter and she sees it. She sees that when it came down to it....Tara comes first and that's hard to mend.\n\nYou fucked up now you gotta deal with it.\n\nAlso this could've been a good step to reconnect but you dropped the ball when Tara was included after Jenny spent years of being separated from yall and could've used one on one time", "YTA for telling her she was invited to dinner with you and then it was both you and her sister. You know there are difficulties there, so you should have been clear about who was going to dinner. Also BTW your headline is disingenuous. Furthermore, you\u2019re probably TA for sending Jenny away like out-of-season holiday decorations. She might feel that you didn\u2019t want her around because you were busy with the sibling that was more important to you. This family needs individual and family therapy. And the Mom and Dad need to stop being AH.", "You spent nearly every moment with one of your children and not the other for two years. You sent her away- whatever good reason you thought you had, that was a profound abandonment. And now you seem to be refusing to spend any time alone with her to help reestablish some kind of relationship between just the two of you?  I\u2019m not surprised she was incandescent with rage. YTA. Please get some family therapy. You\u2019ve all been through a profound trauma and you\u2019ve got very little time left with Jenny at home.", "Different genders and ages, but I lived this as the 'well' child. I applied for emancipation at 16, to the suprise of my family, made a clear case and won. Next talked to them again around my late-20's. While she is still reactive and emotional you have a chance for therapy to work. Once she stops being angry, understand she's done with the bullshit. You can't undo what you already did, but if you want any kind of relationship with your daughter - therapy ASAP, and stop trying to defend and justify the abandonment and neglect. The why dosen't matter to a child. Just that IT HAPPENED.", " God, my heart is broken for Jenny. \n\nYTA. You abandoned your daughter for years, never visited, at a huge developmental stage of her life, and now you\u2019re mad at her because she isn\u2019t just happy to be back with you? You say she likes her dad because he buys her things, well at least he\u2019s trying to do something to make her feel wanted and special. What are you doing for her, to make up for years of neglect?\n\nI say this as a mom to a daughter, you are never getting that child back in your life if you don\u2019t drastically change your attitude here and realize the harm your choices have caused your daughter. These are formative years and all she knows us that her mom doesn\u2019t want her around.", "OP,  Jenny just spelled out to you LOUDLY, what she wants from you.  She wants one on one time with you.  No Tara involved.  She has been playing second fiddle to Tara since Tara got sick.  In her eyes, you even shipped her off to MIL because Tara was more important to you, than Jenny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.  You need to put Jenny in therapy.  You need to start family therapy ASAP.  This is not going to get better unless you start doing the work needed to rebuild your relationship with Jenny alone.  No Tara.  Those girls will have to work that out themselves.", "YTA. Op your daughters life was ruined by her sister, and while it wasn't intentional it'll still have long lasting effects on her. You should spend one on one time with her, and after a while of doing that try and the two of them to do stuff together.", "Glass Child syndrome. Look it up, get help. \n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nTara had you for 2 years alone and you can\u2019t even give her a night just the two of you? You need family therapy and you need it now, she needs to talk about her feelings in a neutral place, just you, your hubby and Jenny", "I would love to write something gentle and kind because I know how hard it is to have a sick child\u2026but reading your comments it\u2019s painfully obvious that you not only do not want to understand Jenny, you harbor disdain for her (understandable) behavior and you are not doing anything to make Jenny feel accepted and part of the family. You have abandoned her completely for 2 years, saw her handful of times in those two years, have no real interest in her, and you keep pushing Tara on her. You still think only of Tara, it\u2019s obvious she is the golden child.\nJenny also lived deep trauma when her sister got sick, and on top of that she was abandoned at her grandma, away from family and friends, her whole life uprooted\u2026I bet you all the video games in the world that Jenny felt and feel unlovable, unloved, and not part of your family.\nIt seems that even though Tara is, thankfully, healthy you have lost one of your daughters anyway. But it\u2019s ok, you don\u2019 t seem to care a lot anyway. \nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou spent two years with Tara in the hospital, yes she was sick and you worried but Jenny was without you for two years. Least you can do is to spend some alone time with her! \n\nAlso while in the hospital how much did you comunicate with her?\n\nShe spend time with your husband because I immagine she sow him at least.", "So you left Jenny away from her family for nearly 2 years and you thought you'd get to play happy family the minute you take her back like the 2 years never happened?\n\nIts understandable that you had to prioritise Tara's health, but you abandoned Jenny for 2 years. You'll have to earn your way back.\n\nAlso, how much communication you had with Jenny in those 2 years. Like you had daily phone calls, weekly visits, etc?\n\nYTA even without the additional info.", "INFO: how much time did you and your husband spend with jenny when she was staying at her grandma? How often did you call her etc?\n\nFrom your text i get the feeling you didn't visit her very often and when you did it was mostly her dad who went to see her. \n\nIf this is correct, jennys reaction is more than understandable. She got sent away, removed from her own family w/o any fault of her own and from her pov only her dad cared enough for her to see her. Andnow, when she could finally came home, she doesn't get any quality time with only you either. For her you just confirmed her pov that you don't care about her :(", "OP, you sent your daughter away for years to take care of your other child.\n\nDo you seriously not have the ability to grasp why she is upset?", "YTA, this isn\u2019t about Tara.  It\u2019s about you and Jenny.  Their bond as sisters isn\u2019t for you to manage.  Jenny thought she was going to get to spend some time with her mother, and you changed that without a thought as to what Jenny needs.  I am so happy for you that Tara is doing better but that doesn\u2019t change what Jenny experienced and she needs to be supported as well.", "OP you need to spend time one on one with Jenny ASAP. You need to listen to her and her feelings, and you need to do this without bringing up Tara, Tara's illness, or how hard YOU had it.\n\nYou need to tell her that you love her, that you missed her horribly, and that from now on you will be there for her.\n\nYes it was hell for all of you, but your daughter is just a kid. A kid who went two years without her parents. All this was traumatic for her too, and now she needs reassurance that you love her just as much as Tara, that you worry about her, that you want to be closer to her.\n\nYou are going to have to work on this relationship in order for it to heal. You are losing your daughter. In four years she'll be an adult, unless you do something by then don't expect to hear from her once she moves out. Spend time with her, just her. Listen to her thoughts, spoil her a little. For 2 years Tara had your undivided attention. Spare some time each week to do the same for Jenny, so her little soul can heal from this ordeal.", "You all need family counseling, starting with you and your daughter Jenny.", "YTA, the dinner was for you and Jenny not a girls night out. Where at all in the invite was it mentioned you, Tara and Jennifer?", "Jenny sees that Tara was the reason she was sent off to another city, away from her friends and everything she knows and she was probably hoping that the alone time she missed would be made up now she\u2019s back\n\nShe sees you as biased to Tara, I don\u2019t have the information to know if she is right or wrong in that \n\nYTA I\u2019m afraid, it\u2019s a soft one as I think your heart is in the right place", "Jesus you are dense! You abandoned your child for 2 years and couldn\u2019t even find a few hours a month to spend with her! You only saw her a few time a YEAR?? I\u2019m sorry you had a sick child but you don\u2019t abandon your other one & expect her to be okay!! And now you still refuse to spend one on one time with her?? Do better! You don\u2019t get to to have a girls night you need to repair the relationship with your daughter that you actions destroyed. Yeah I\u2019m sure it was a difficult time for you but you didn\u2019t even TRY.", "YTA and your additional comments reinforce that judgement. \n\nYou don\u2019t sound like you actually want anything to do with Jenny. You came here for advice and in every reply you double down on how you feel and how awful Jenny treats Tara and how hard it is for Tara. \n\nDo you even care about Jenny or are you just trying to repair the relationship because you don\u2019t like how she\u2019s treating Tara?", "So Jenny practically made a big neon sign saying \"MOM, SHOW ME YOU LOVE ME AND SPEND TIME WITH ME\", and you still pretend you don't know why she is upset with you?  YTA", ">Last night her dad managed to convince her to go out to dinner with me\n\nHow lovely mother daughter bonding time\n\n>Tara and I got ready\n\nNevermind then\n\nIt doesn't matter that she was sick, fact of the matter is to your younger daughter she was sent off and your older daughter got all of her parents' love attention devotion and time \n\nNow that she's back, rather than making up for the quality time you both could have spent together, you are trying to throw both your daughters together and act like the past is in the past \n\nYour younger daughter needs her parents love and undivided attention also\n\nYTA\n\nAlso if you were truly paying attention to your daughter you wouldn't be here. She's clearly saying she needs you, her mother, to want to have a relationship with her and spend time with her. Not treat her as a visiting friend\n\nEdit to correct daughters", "YTA! Your daughter missed her family, that she did not get to see for 2 years. She also probably had to leave her friends 2 times now. In that time your focus was 90% of the time on your sick child, which is understandable. Your husband probably spent his time mostly 70-80 % at work and the rest with Tara. In one of your comments you said thefe were only calls bc of tge cost, also understandable, even if it is sad.\n  \nNow i would like to know:\n  \nDid you put in any effort to spend time with Jenny, even if it is only over calls? Where there also video calls?\nBc i talk with my mom almost daily over the phone, even if it's just for 5 minutes, to talk about how our day was, what we did, if there was any trouble etc. and we live like only 15 minutes apart, i get to see her every week!\n \nAlso did your husband spend alone-time with Jenny already? Did they maybe call more often in those 2 years?\n   \nI think what you should do is spend quality time with Jenny! I know you want your daughters to get along, but Jenny most likely feels neglected. Right now she thinks bad of her sister bc she thinks she stole her parents, especially you, away. Even if she most likely somewhere in her heart knows her sister could not do anything about it, she needed a villain.\nFor now you should maybe go out alone with Jenny, do something she enjoys, hell maybe, if you can afford it, go on a trip for 1 or 2 days alone with her.\nHere i mean only you, the mom, and Jenny, while ylu husband can watch after Tara, bc right now it looks like he and Jenny are already on better terms!\nAfter you went on a few outings, even if it's just grocery shopping, you can try and slowly include Tara ^^", "Your daughter needs some therapy.  She is harboring some major feelings and emotions about being abandoned.  She probably feels that you \"chose\" your other daughter over her.  She would probably enjoy some one on one time with you to help reconnect.  Spend some time with her and talk with her.  You already knew there were issues so I'm not sure why you invited Tara to go along too, but your daughter feels pushed aside and unimportant.  \nI'm not saying that all of this is really true...but her feelings are her feelings.", "YTA\n\nYou were in an impossible situation for a few years, during which you had to prioritize Tara. \n\nIf you couldn't visit for those 2 years (as you've said in the comments), she will definitely be feeling abandoned, because she was. Calling simply is not a substitute for parenting. Talk to her, and without being defensive, acknowledge that you weren't there for her. Do not bring Tara into it, because at the end of the day, you were the adult responsible for the relationship.\n\nYou mentioned that your husband isn't subject to Jenny's behaviour because he buys her things. While I don't think buying someone's affection is a great idea, here it's showing Jenny that she at least *matters* to her father. He's doing something, even if that something isn't the best idea. \n\nYou're saying that Jenny won't work with you, but she shouldn't have to--she is the child, traumatized by the abandonment of her parents. It is up to you to rebuild that bridge. She may see fit to meet you halfway at some point, but you are a long way from that.\n\nAs far as this specific episode goes, it seems that you're determined to go back to normal now that the crisis with Tara has passed, but the truth of the matter is that the normal in your mind no longer exists. Jenny isn't the same person anymore, just as this whole situation has changed everyone in your family. \n\nYou're trying to heal you family as a whole, but need to keep in mind that that can only be accomplished by working on the individual relationships. Right now focus on *your* relationship with Jenny, which means *a lot* of 1:1 time. Every now and then do something with the whole family, but Jenny should not feel like she is less of a priority than her sister. You have a lot of time to make up for.\n\nAnd you need to realize that Jenny and Tara's relationship may never recover from this. Don't force it, or it will come at the expense of your relationship with Jenny,\n\nAll you can do now is make sure that Jenny knows that she is loved.", "YTA, try listening to her and hangout with her just you two. Give her that time she clearly also needs one on one .inviting her sister will make it worse . She will warm back up to her sis eventually if you actively listen and not just do what u think is better.", "YTA. You need to listen to your daughter. She spent two years feeling like you didn't care about her at all. I get that your other daughter was sick. Nothing changes that. But you absolutely need to talk to her, get her into therapy, and focus on spending one-on-one time with her. My heart breaks for this poor girl. She didn't ask for her sister to be sick, either. And, unlike you, she was a child when this all happened. She deserves to feel as though her mother cares about her.", "She needs 1 on 1 or 2 on 1 and a whole lot of rebuilding based on being seen as her own person. And she blames Tara for causing it and you for sending her away.\n\nYou put her out of sight to make your life easier. You shouldn\u2019t have done that.\n\nThere was another one of these a couple of months ago from a young man who was shipped off for the same reason but much younger. The sibling died 15 years later and suddenly the parents remembered their other child and ludicrously thought that they should get a free pass for their abandonment and were shocked to discover that their child hated them. \n\nYou\u2019ve a lot of work ahead of you.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Since your daughter came back home, have you ever spent anytime with her alone? Op your daughter said what is paining her, so please do better. You sent her away and yes she may understand but you could have sought to spend some time with her apart from your sickly daughter. Even from the way your post reads, you see the sick daughter and yourself as a team against your husband and daughter.", "YTA you REALLY need to make some time and build some bridges with Jenny. She is only 14.", "My soft YTA judgement turned to just a YTA judgement based on your replies. Please, for the sake of both your daughters, read and digest and reflect on what people are saying here. \n\nYou need to spend 1-1 time with Jenny. Ask her questions about how she\u2019s feeling. Understand what her experience was like while she was apart from the rest of her family. You need to give the girls space to get to know each other again. You all individually need therapy.", "Jenny thought she was going to dinner with just you. She's tired of being second fiddle to Tara. You need to prioritize Jenny now and try to spend time just with her and make up for SENDING HER AWAY!  You all need family therapy also. YTA", "YTA. Your daughter needs a mother. If you don\u2019t want to do that, find someone who will on a permanent basis.\n\nETA: for anyone else here wondering, it\u2019s not a great idea to rehome a child like a dog.", "YTA you\u2019ve spent years putting Tara before Jenny for everything. Jenny wants to spend time with **YOU** not her sister. in her mind her sister is the reason she was sent away to live with her grandparents, she needs a therapist and one on one time with not just your husband but *you*. she has a lot of very understandable resentment for her sister (which is definitely your fault, having a sick child does not mean that you get to only focus on that child and forget about everything else).", "YTA \n\nTara was sick, and I understand why you made the decisions that you did, but to Jenny, you abandoned her in favor of her sister. She is a child and so even though she might understand why things happened the way they did, she is still entitled to her feelings about it, and has no control over feeling that way. For 2 years you devoted your life to one daughter and the other was pushed aside. Again, I understand the circumstances, but this is how Jenny sees things. And since she\u2019s been home it seems like you have made no effort to make her feel special again. And by inviting Tara you once again made her feel less important. \n\nYou need family therapy and Jenny probably needs individual therapy. Fix this or you truly will only have one daughter once Jenny turns 18 and cuts contact with you completely.", " YTA\n\n\nEverybody reading this can see that you care more for tara and do put her first every time- even when it is completly unnessary. \n\n\n\nMost parents try to make up if they have to focus soely on one child- with attention and ressources-. You do the opposide. You weridly seem to try and do the opposide. \n\n\n\nJenny told you why she does not spend time with you. You saying \"that is not true\" or acting like \"she does not tell me why\" doesn't make your words true.\n\n\nSpend one on one time with Jenny! It is not that hard.", "YTA. Every life is not \"normal\". You removed Jenny from her home and friends. For two years when she was 12. If she was 2 this would make sense, but not 12. It's understandable she resents both you and Tara. Did you actually discuss this move with her? Did she agree with it?", "YTA. Jenny did not have a mother for 2 years. I understand that Tara was sick, and that as a mom you needed to be there for her, BUT that doesn't make Jenny need you any less. She deserved an evening with her mom. Of course she resents all of you. That's only to be expected. Did you really think she would just come back all smiles and be grateful she's in the family again?", "YTA\n\nYou abandoned your daughter for two years.\n\nI wonder why she might want some alone time with you.", "She\u2019s 15, and feels abandoned by you / insecure in your love. Don\u2019t even bother with that rational shit of my other daughter was sick. Emotions don\u2019t deal in facts, especially at 15. Your younger daughter is secure in her relationship with you. The older one is not, and needs one on one time with you and most likely individual therapy, along with family therapy. Otherwise your family is just going to be minus your older daughter in the long run. \nI don\u2019t want to say yta because this isn\u2019t about that, this is much more complex", "YTA she NEEDS to spend time with her mother alone. Listen to your child! Two years you spent with you other daughter alone and neglecting her. Just spend time with her alone.", "Yta why can\u2019t you have some time alone with Jenny? Tara got you for 2 years, now it\u2019s time to reconnect with Jenny, it\u2019s time for her to be priority, if you want the girls to be friends, then plan dates with only Jenny, and girls day with both of them, but you can\u2019t include Tara in everything because Jenny for 2 years wasn\u2019t included", "Gentle YTA on this one. Tara's illness dominated everything to the point that you had to send your daughter away. To you that was practical but have you ever considered that Jenny felt abandoned? For years it felt like you were consistently choosing her sister over her. How often did you go visit Jenny while her sister was ill? How often did you call? Did Jenny cease to be any sort of presence/priority in your life it was all of your time, focus, attention, energy, spent on Tara? \n\nReally think about what you're asking Jenny to do here. She's finally got her mom back and once again, she has to sacrifice some one on one time with her Mom by having the sister mom really loves tag along. Your daughters will most likely need more time and a therapist to repair their relationship. In fact, you and your daughter will likely need a therapist as well. \n\nYou weren't wrong for being there for Tara, just to be clear, but what about Jenny? Who was there for her?\n\nEDIT: Firm YTA. You didn't go see your daughter once in two years. Not one time. You literally phoned it in. I'm sure having a sick child was stressful, but you completely abandoned your other child. The fact that you seem to be taking zero responsibility for the role you played in the demise of your relationship with your daughter is very telling. Jenny is a CHILD. It is YOUR responsibility to make the bigger effort here.", "YTA one on one time is definitely needed. Even us strangers see this. You'd think being close up and in your face you'd notice it more.", "YTA. Just because one child is gravely ill, the other doesn\u2019t cease to exist and need the love and attention of her parents. Jenny is counting the days until she goes away to college or escapes you at 18. You abandoned her for Tara.", "INFO: did Jenny understand why you were sending her away? Was this something you communicated to her or you and your husband? Did you routinely check in on Jenny and spend any time with her while she was at your MIL\u2019s? And did she see any sort of therapist about her experiences? \n\nI feel like there\u2019s more to it, but I\u2019m leaning towards YTA.\n\nThere\u2019s no manual for how to balance a child with a serious illness when you have other children at home. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s not easy, especially if it\u2019s a particularly serious illness. That being said, you\u2019re responsible for the well being of all your children. At that age, they\u2019re learning how to process their emotions differently than they did as children because they understand a lot more. She\u2019s only 14. At first glance it\u2019s sounds like you just shipped her off and forgot about her for 2 years. And while I know you weren\u2019t exactly home everyday, on the couch watching housewives, that\u2019s still 2 very formidable and crucial years that you missed out on. If it were me, I\u2019d want to make up for that time by doing a lot of things 1:1 to rebuild the relationship.", "You can\u2019t have one dinner with Jenny alone without forcing Tara on her, after you abandoned Jenny for 2 years without even visiting?

She climbs up front with me and we have deep conversations. I dye her hair funky colors on long weekends. We play video games. We go shopping. We even just walk the neighborhood together.

The one that was actually send away from home, family and friends so you could put her sister first?\n\nYou need to stop thinking like Tara is the center of the universe, she has needs, but Jenny isn't allowed to have them reading your posts. You need to stop and immediately work on your relationship with Jenny, or you will lose a daughter and Tara will lose a sister.", "YTA in Jenny\u2019s eyes, you abandoned her and sent her away for two years.

She was apart from you and you guys have a lot to make up for. Jenny i assume feels this should be her turn to get attention.

I saw you answered that you also never visited her or even switched a weekend with your husband to go see Jenny in two years she was away. When she visited she still didn't get your full attention.  A lot of parents make the mistake on hyper-focusing on the sick child, making the other one(s) feel abandoned.\nYour entire family needs counselling, and Jenny definitely needs therapy. You also need to go on exclusive mother-daughter dates with Jenny so you two can develop, nit re-establish, the mother-daughter bond as the old one was broken and you have to put the effort in now before you lose Jenny.\nAs Jenny matures, and with therapy,  it's easier to build a sister bond, but *you* have a lot of work to do to make Jenny feel like she is your daughter, too.", "YTA.

But Jenny suffered immensely and at a critical age. It sounds like she feels abandoned by you so I am going to guess that you didn\u2019t do enough to maintain mother daughter bond during the time of Tara\u2019s illness. You must show a real effort to reconnect with your daughter and yes that includes lots of one on one times. Lots of parents make an effort to spend time with their children individually even under normal circumstances and you seem unwilling despite all the problems. Also entire family needs therapy.", " Yta- I\u2019d started by having a conversation with her or even her door if she won\u2019t open it. Admiring that you completely messed up, because you did.

Then you literally have to do whatever she wants. She wants to go see a movie you hate, you go see it with her. She wants to dye her hair a funky colour you help her do it. Just spend time with her- alone. And start counselling, both individually and as a family, and maybe even as a mother daughter duo. Once you begin to fix your relationship with her than you can approach her about restarting her relationship with her sister, especially if you take all blame for her neglect and tell her the whole truth about how sick her sister was and that it wasn\u2019t her fault but your own. \nYes your husband may seem to be buying her affection which isn\u2019t good, but I\u2019m sure he is also trying to make up for two years which he will never actually be able to do. But it keeps the lines of communication open", "OP please look up Glass Child syndrome, I think it will really help you understand your daughter's behaviour. YTA.

Obviously we all understand why you felt it was the best thing for her compared to the alternatives, but you need to be able to acknowledge that even so it was likely a really awful time for her. She\u2019s lost a lot of time with you all in some really formative years and I\u2019m sure she worries about being \u201cabandoned\u201d again if any other family crisis occurred. \n\nShe needs you to really listen to her about her experiences and not try to explain how they could have been worse. She likely would benefit from therapy. And she needs time with you, her parent, without feeling like that time is going to be parcelled off to Tara. Spend time with her 1 on 1, show her she absolutely matters to you, and you will probably find that it helps her relationship with Tara too.", "I'm a bit puzzled: You know what the problem is. You know how to solve it. So why aren't you doing that instead of posting on reddit? That makes it YTA.\n\nYou stole all your love, support, and attention from one daughter to give it to the other, because you had a massive reason why you would do that. Okay. But now that reason has passed, and your behavior hasn't changed back. Jenny's not stupid and she accurately called you on it. You know what you need to do, so why aren't you doing it?", "YTA\n\nstop trying to manage Jenny\u2019s relationships with her sister and her father. the more you meddle and pressure, the worse it will get. focus on your relationship with Jenny. by pushing Tara on her, you\u2019re showing Jenny that she\u2019s, once again, an afterthought and that Tara is the more important child.\n\notherwise, don\u2019t be surprised if Jenny goes to college on the opposite side of the country and stops all contact with you.", "Your daughter Jenny is screaming for attention. She needs to be assured that she's a priority for you guys too. And while you may not be coming from a malicious intention in sending her away to give her a less tumultuous life with hospital visits, she may have felt abandoned. Plan for 1:1 dates with her. Also have the girls spend some 1:1 time doing some fun activity so that they build a bond with each other, and Jenny starts empathizing with the illness her sister went through. It'll be awkward initially, but you need to be patient and giver her space and time. Also, I see that both your girls are in their teens - never known to be an easy phase in any household. So, all one can say is, don't be too harsh on them or on yourself", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you're looking at this only from a high level rational point of view and not a base emotional point of view.

It's not jealousy, it's more of a deep hurt.\n\nShe feels unwanted. She probably feels like you discarded her when it wasn't convenient for you.\n\nI know that isn't true and you were just trying to do your best. But it doesn't seem like you understand it from Jenny's point of view.\n\nMy recommendation:\nImmediately prioritise spending time with Jenny. Do some one on one activities with her. You should apologise, but also show your apology through actions.\nDemonstrate your love for her through your actions and show her that she is wanted and loved.\nYou should also talk with her about how she feels. It's interesting that you haven't done this and instead immediately came to Reddit. Why not ask her how she feels?\nThis might mean you will need to accept a rebuke from her and admit how it looked. You need to accept this rebuke otherwise she might never trust you again.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to choose one child over the other with no consequences\u2026and this is the consequence.

Did y\u2019all not think she was sad about her sister and maybe would\u2019ve wanted to be with her? She was probably terrified and was away from her nuclear family. Y\u2019all need therapy but the bare minimum you and your spouse could do is something with your other daughter. If you need a babysitter for the you her for whatever reason just hit up MIL again.", "YTA. While part of me can see why you sent Jenny away, a larger part of me can see her POV. Her parents basically abandoned her in another town and poured all their energy and time into their other daughter for two years. And when YOU decided it what convenient, you brought her home and expect her to be normal.\n\nI can\u2019t control what your husband is doing, but he may be buying her forgiveness and prioritizing Jenny over Tara now. While that isn\u2019t cool either, you only seem to recognize him favoring one daughter over the other now and not that the two of you have done that for two years to her.\n\nBest thing you can do as a mom, if you\u2019re determined to try and fix your relationship with the daughter you abandoned, is to sit her down one on one. No husband, no Tara. Have an honest and heartfelt conversation and admit you were wrong. Try to cautiously explain why you did what you did. Promise it will never happen again and that you would like the two of you to work together to fix things with one another. Schedule a weekly bonding time between just the two of you. A weekly lunch or shopping trip or coffee date. And get reacquainted. You had ample time one on one with Tara, so you\u2019re not leaving her out.

And that you sent her away for Tara.  Even though your reason was not a bad one, a hard one infact.  Jenny doesn\u2019t see it that way.  Jenny wanted time with YOU, for dinner not her sister.  Jenny has a shitload of resentment towards you and her sister.  I can bet that Jenny felt abandoned because of her sister.  This is a terrible situation.  You need outside help for all of you, because I can assure you anything you say Jenny may say she understands but she hates you for it.

At the very least you should have gotten Jenny into therapy to help her cope. Tara had you and to an extent her father. Jenny was abandoned with grandma.

When you shipped Jenny off to her grandmothers did you ever make time to explain to her why she was shipped off? Did you ever make time to go spend the day with her? Call her? Show her that you love her and still care about her? It doesn\u2019t sound like you did. And that\u2019s why she wants nothing to do with you. To her, you shipped her off so you could spend more alone time with your other daughter and be a family of three and just happened to remember that she still existed and \u201csummoned\u201d her back home for whatever reason. And I don\u2019t think you thought this reunion through enough. I think you thought that everything would just go back to normal and that she would just understand your motives. But if you never told her, how could she? I believe where you need to start is mending your personal relationship with her and encouraging Tara and Jenny to find their way without your interference. If that means family counseling, then you guys are going to have to do that. You were in a super tough situation, and handled it the best you knew how but still fell short. That\u2019s life, fortunately mistakes can be rectified with sincerity and work. Listen to your daughter and what she needs from you. It looks like she resents Tara and blames her, but it\u2019s really you she resents (sounds harsh, sorry). Deep down she knows Tara is not at fault for being sick, but because of that you actively \u201cabandoned\u201d Jenny.

No friends, no parents, no family time. \nYou're invalidating her feelings because you refuse to admit you were and are wrong.

And i know its not your fault Tara was sick and needed to be hospitalized, but from Jenny's pov, she had to be uprooted for her sisters sake. I know it may not seem like it, but i think its fair that you spend some 1 on 1 time with Jenny. Explain it as best you can to Tara, and maybe see if therapy is something that could help Jenny.", "I dont think you are an AH, at least from what you have said. But looks like Jenny is needing some attention, you just spend 2 years fully dedicated to Tara (for a very valid reason) so now you need to build again the relationship with Jenny.\n\nTry to be compasive and spend time alone with her, none of you had it easy in the last years but she is just a teenager, if you need help you may talk to a psy for doing family therapy.\n\nEdit:\nIf for 2 years you didnt visit Jenny yes YTA, by wanting to take care of one of your daughters you lose the other one", "YTA you didn't visit her in those two yrs according to your comments. Your angry she is more for her dad because he's putting her before her sister after you both abandoned her for 2 yrs. You want her involved with your golden child but she has told you how she feels. She wants YOU on your own NOT with her sister but you won't do that because you want tara to feel included. You have all shown she was an after thought for 2yrs. She feels abandoned ffs you know how she feels she's telling you. \n\nKeep putting tara first and you will lose jenny if you haven't already. \n\nEach comment you make is all about tara do you even like the child you abandoned for 2yrs with her grandmother. Who you couldn't be bothered to visit.", "Yta", "YTA\nBut now you know and nows the time to fix things before it gets out of hand..\nI've read enough reddit to see what the potential ending will be", "Yta and a shitty mother. You send your daughter away and in those 2 years never visited her?!  y\u2019all need some counseling and sounds like you can benefit from some one on one", "YTA. This is how glass children are born and raised.", "YTA\n\nI was going to give you a soft YTA but then I read your responses and the fact that it was up to Jenny to have come visit for two years but you never went to see her doesn\u2019t sit well with me. From your comments, you\u2019re more worried about how Jenny is making you and Tara feel rather than being her mother and thinking about the way you made her feel. Separate your own feelings-this isn\u2019t about you. You have a child that feels that you abandoned her for her sibling and you keep trying to push a relationship between all of you, when that obviously isn\u2019t what she wants right now. Your entire family needs therapy and you all need to think about Jenny for once.", "YTA OP. Jenny agreed to go to dinner with what she thought was just you then you threw Tara in her face last minute. You neglected Jenny\u2019s need for a mother for two years to take care of Tara, you foisted her off on a grandparent \u201cfor her own good\u201d, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you did enough to keep up your relationship with her. Your husband recognized quickly that when Jenny moved back he needed to make up the last two years to her. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019d had more contact with her during the two years than you since she was willing to let him try and fix things. Then here you are, not worried so much about your relationship with Jenny but about the fact your daughters don\u2019t spend time together. Of course Jenny resents Tara even if she knows on an intellectual level she needed more of your attention while sick. But she\u2019ll also see all the times where you guys as parents could have made time for her or should have made time for her and didn\u2019t. You need to fix the relationship between you and your daughter before there is any chance of them fixing their sibling relationship. You need to show Tara that you can put her needs/ wants above Jenny\u2019s some times. And most importantly you all need to get in family therapy. Right now you\u2019re on track for losing your youngest once she can be financially independent. It would be really bad for you to pay for Tara\u2019s car/college/anything and not do the same for Jenny so before you do something for Tara make sure you\u2019ll be able to do it for Jenny even if your circumstances changes.", "YTA.  Listen to yourself.  You are not the victim here.  You have the opportunity to try to fix things with Jenny.  Y\u2019all need family therapy and individual therapy.", "YTA, and your relationship with your daughter went one more step towards permanently dead and broken. \n\nHer sister got 120% of her parents love for two full years. Sent to live with grandma. Feeling dumped because 'she's healthy, she doesn't need us. her sister is FAR more important'. (Remember, this is a young teenager's POV here) It sounds like you didn't even ask Jenny what she wanted. Just the stereotypical jerk parents: \"I AM 200% I KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR MY KIDS! I DON'T NEED TO ASK THEM! THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WANT. I AM SUPERIOR. I AM INTELLIGENT. I, AM A PARENT.\" \n\nYou have YEARS of groveling to make up for this. \n\nAnd make NO MISTAKE here.

Don\u2019t be surprised at 18 she cuts you off.", "YTA she wants to only spend time with you. Stop forcing her to spend time with Tara, its no ones fault but you sent her away. She lost her mother and father for two years. She resents Tara for it. She doesnt want to share - even though Tara was ill and having the worst time in hospitals, Jenny didnt have you and now she wants your undivided attention. You owe her this.\n\nYou have to first rebuild your relationship with Jenny. Only then once its established should you add Tara to the mix. It might be that she cant get over what happened and then you start going to therapy as a family.", "YTA\n\nCircumstances don't justify favoritism.", "I read through your comments and I am stunned how much you are missing the point.\n\nStop trying to pin crap on your husband. Stop trying to play the victim. While I am sorry Tara went through Hell, Jenny was abandoned by her parents. You don't think that but she does.\n\nShe sees herself getting thrown away by her parents. Parents who love Tara more than her. It might not be true but that is what she sees. You need to work on that before you can do anything else.\n\nYou need to create a Bond with her first because right now she thinks you love Tara more. You need to prove you don't before she can love Tara.\n\nYTA", "YTA. At this point, your family dynamics are on course for a major collision - in fact, it's already begun.\n\nJenny was convinced to go out to dinner with *you*. But it wasn't you, it was you and Tara. Jenny is crying out for time with her mother, and you can't afford her that, because you want them to bond and get along. You trying to force it isn't going to make it happen. You basically ditched her for her sister, and continue to to not focus on her, but rather, them both. Even had both girls been healthy throughout - each child *deserves and requires* one on one time with their parent(s). You aren't providing that.  \n\nYou need family counseling at a minimum. You are trying to play the victim when you aren't. Dad is trying to play Santa Claus to alleviate his guilt. Jenny is resentful that she's been shunned. Tara, although having been ill, is still in the same position - getting what seems to be more attention than Jenny. This situation is a time bomb.", "Yta\n\n\nSo when times are rough, you just threw your healthy daughter away, and now that she's back you wonder why she's not close to her sister and you? You failed her as a parent. It's super clear that she just wanted to try just dinner with you, but nope. You had to bring along someone who, right now, she blames on being sent away. Yes, family therapy is NEEDED, but you need to do your part. Seriously.", "YTA. You threw her away. What did you expect?", "YTA because for 2 years you gave all your attention to one daughter. The other one was \u201cshipped away\u201d. I know this was probably for the best, but this is not something that a normal child has to go through. I would focus on spending alone time with Tara going forward. She needs to feel loved not just in words, but in action.", "YTA. Your daughter has been forced to live out-of-home for two years. It sucks that your other daughter got very sick, but the way you handled that was atrocious. You essentially told Jenny she's too much to handle right now, so you pawned her off to some family for a couple of years.  \n  \nAnd now that she's back home, she gets treated to Tara favoritism.  \n  \nThis may not be your intent, or how you see what has happened, but you're looking at it with the calmness and knowledge of an adult. Not the absolute wreck that is a 14 year old's inexperienced teenage brain.  \n  \nGive Jenny some alone time, let her know her mother is there for her, and she was not abandoned in favor of the other daughter.", "YTA.  Now, since you obviously only give a fig about Tara - if you want Tara to have a sister, and a relationship with Jenny, you need to stop neglecting your younger daughter.  You need to remediate some of the resentment that is a result of your own actions of excluding Jenny and failing to meet her needs.  Forcing Jenny to \"bond\" with Tara will only breed more resentment, and is counterproductive to your goals of nurturing your favorite daughter.\n\nThank goodness Jenny's got her father.", "YTA. You gave your daughter up for TWO years to take care of your other daughter and you don't see that you need to reconcile and bond with her. You gave her away for TWO years but you can't even go to dinner without the other? Your husband had talked your daughter into giving you another chance and you completely blew it!", "YTA - You asked to have dinner with YOU.... not you and her sister who you displaced your daughter for. You need to work on the relationship with your estranged daughter.... JUST you. The fact that you threw in her sister was really out of touch.", "YTA. Froggoten child syndrome.  have seen it happen within my extended family.  Your reasoning is absolutely irrelevant.  You  compounded it by trying to bring the other child  out with you after your husband finally convinced her to go out with you. Unfortunately, you are still in that mind set.  Immediate therapy is required NOW  but i have little hope because you have justified and rationslized  your actions and behavior. This is not going to end well..", "YTA. Unfortunate situation regarding Tara but sorry YTA. Best thing for who? Jenny or you? Be honest with yourself. You sent your 12 year old to live IN ANOTHER CITY with her grandmother. 12 year old girls need their mothers and they need their friends. YOU took away both. Did you call her every single bloody day and be texting each other day and night. Somehow I doubt it. Did she even ever come to visit during that time? How much time did you set aside from Jenny. Do you know how her life was actually life with her grandmother? Standard case of the curse of the able bodied child. \n\nShe blames you for abandoning her and Tara for being the reason why. She knows gun to your head she isn't the priority in your life. Why your husband has escaped her wrath is anyones guess. If you want to fix this then its going to be a bloody long road but you need to actually start spending some 1 on 1 time with Jenny.", "YTA\n\nI agree with the comments saying Jenny needs therapy.  But more importantly OP needs therapy as she doesn't see anything wrong with how she is handling things.\n\nHow did dad respond to what happened?

Good luck.", "YTA, and you can fix it\n\nThere are many, many supports available for families with sick children. If you\u2019re in the US, you had access to a child life specialist, case manager, social worker, and family therapist. \n\nAll of these professionals would have been focused on helping to make sure that your family had the support and resources you needed during such a long hospitalization. \n\nThey also have specific sibling support in children\u2019s hospitals because of this very concern, where siblings feel ignored while their parents focus all attention on the patient. \n\nI\u2019m intimately familiar with these resources as a parent and a professional. \n\nParenting all of our children and maintaining the cohesion of our families remains our job no matter the circumstances. \n\nRelatives and friends can come to our homes to help. Schedules for shifts at the hospital can be made. \n\nWhen there is a conflict or rupture with one of our children, the onus is on us to repair it. Always. This is how we guide and teach and parent our children. \n\nShow your daughter that people make mistakes, even with good intentions. Demonstrate how to humble yourself to admit you were wrong, listen to her pain and ask for her forgiveness. Embody what it means to repair and strengthen a loving, healthy relationship. \n\nFamily therapy is a wonderful idea.\n\nEdit: missing word", "OPs comments turn her from a soft YTA mum who has good intentions into a complete dumpster fire of a parent lol.\n\nShe is clearly far too narcissistic to realise how big a tool she is.

You may have done what you thought was best but there is fall out and you have to stop ignoring it.  From Jenny's perspective, you sent her away to focus 100% on Tara.

You have ALL been traumatised and all have so much healing to do, individually and as a family. \n\nBut yes, in this instance, YTA for including both daughters.  You removed your youngest from your family to focus on your eldest.  I understand why you did it but, from Jenny's perspective, she had a family, then there was the hell of finding out Tara was ill, I am guessing several months of hospital visits before she was sent away and, likely the most traumatising, then effectively ignored by her parents for 2 years.   I grew up with a severely ill father, and spent months of my teen years waiting in hospitals. There's time.  If anything, there's too much time. You could have spent 10 minutes on the phone every night to wish her good night. You could have taken it in turns to visit her on your time off. But no, every single waking second had to be spent obsessing over Tara. \n\nShe has spent 2 years without parents, who didn't even visit her.  I am guessing when she came back she had hoped that she would go back into the loving family you had been before Tara got ill.  Except you have been a family - a family of 3, with all your attention focused on one daughter.  And after two years of every waking moment being focused on tara, and likely barely even thinking about Jenny, I am not surprised OP that you are struggling to adjust to having 2 daughters again. But you have two daughters, one of which you have barely seen in 2 years.  \n\nIt's not up to Jenny to work to rebuild her relationship with you.  You are the adult, the parent and you are the one who abandoned her.  You need to make time for BOTH of your daughters individually.

She only got phone calls. She's only 14 and being 14 is hard on anyone let alone someone who has gone through as much as Jenny has. She's feeling a lot of big emotions and has no where to put them.

For 2 years I had to be in the hospital all the time and my husband had to work 2 jobs to be able to pay for the hospital\n\nWe decided that the best thing to do for Jenny would be to send her to live with my MIL who lives in another city. She is the only close family we have. We were trying to give Jenny a normal life otherwise she would spend all her time in a hospital like us.\n\nNow that Tara is better, things are a lot better and we asked Jenny to come back home and she was glad to do so however she only ever spends time with her dad, never with me or Tara and she never says why she doesn't want to spend time with us. Not just that she also actively bullies Tara any chance she gets\n\nLast night her dad managed to convince her to go out to dinner with me. Tara and I got ready and we were waiting for Jenny. She came out of her room and saw us there, turned to my husband and said she changed her mind and went back to her room. I followed her and asked what's wrong. She started screaming at me asking me if I have to include Tara in everything. She accused me of not enjoying spending my time with her and \"bringing Tara so that I could spend time with Tara and pretend to like Jenny\" I told her this is not true and I was just trying to have a girls night with both of my daughters but she screamed at me to get out and called me an asshole and other names\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've learned that children need individual parent 1:1 time that doesn't include their siblings semi regularly (having raised 4 children myself). Jenny feels passed over and neglected. Did you all explain to her that you were trying to give her a normal life while her sister was sick? Was it explained to her it was a temporary situation because you didn't want to burden her with being at the hospital all the time? Either way, I am really not for children cursing/being ultra disrespectful (yes, they're allowed to be angry but not at the expense of using profanity etc.) at their parents, I think the sisters need to learn how to be sisters again. Seems like Jenny needs lessons in compassion as well as being understood while not being able to clearly articulate her feelings. Tara needs to understand why her sister feels neglected and then try communicating how difficult it was being sick for 2 years. Everyone here needs to learn that none of this was easy on any of you, especially both girls. Good luck to you all and glad you have 2 healthy children. Everyone needs to be heard here.", "YTA. You completely abandon your daughter and you wonder why she's being a dick to you. She needs one on one time with you but she's not getting it.

You said you did your best, but you couldn't give up one day a week to be by your other daughter? I'm certain your husband could have helped in the hospital. Now it seems like Jenny is feeling resentful of you because she probably feels like you just gave her away like nothing. It seems like she wants a relationship with you, but some 1 on 1 time instead of you including Tara. In Jenny's mind she's probably like '\"I cant believe my mother was with Tara for 2 years and don't even want to spend some alone time with me\"", "YTA. It was a dinner for you and Jenny, not a girls night for you, Jenny, and Tara. If you really reflect on the situation, it\u2019s clear the issue is not only the time and attention you give to Tara, but that you sent Jenny away to do it. And now Jenny can\u2019t even have 1-on-1 time with you.\n\nI understand your intentions for sending Jenny away, but you have to be open to the reality that Jenny didn\u2019t internalize it that way. No child would.\n\nJenny is doing her best to survive in a situation where she\u2019s uncomfortable and probably feels unwanted. As her mother, you need to listen to her and address her needs without including Tara.", "YTA - light. This is a 14 year old that while rationally speaking went to be with your MIL for all the right reasons may be working through some resentment. You should do something special for her especially knowing she is being cold and distant to the two of you. She is a kid and you are the adult. I get Terra had it rough and I suspect in a different way Jenny had it rough too!", "YTA\n\nWow, just because Tara was going through a tough time doesn\u2019t diminish that fact that Jenny ALSO was going through a tough time. Yes Tara was in the hospital and it was probably a very scary 2 years for you to watch that. However you can\u2019t just ditch the other kids then dis invalidate Jenny\u2019s feelings. She also lost a sister and her parents for 2 years, she was left to deal by herself. \n\nShe knows who\u2019s mommy\u2019s favourite is and she\u2019s not even in the race anymore, she\u2019s not even on mommy\u2019s radar. Daddy in the other hand is making her feel seen, heard and the way she sees Tara being treated by mommy. \n\nIf you do not start therapy for the family and individually PLUS some self reflection then Jenny will go no contact once she\u2019s out of the house. You will be here again on Reddit crying asking why your daughter hates you and you\u2019ll still blame her. \n\nGet your head out of Tara\u2019s ass and show love to Jenny, even sitting at a restaurant with her headphones in.

They can try to stay with the family with the option to ask you to go to grandma's for breaks or if they want to. Jenny's shot at a typical childhood was gone the second Tara got sick. And instead of having her parents and siblings she was sent away like an inconvenience. \n\nWhen was the last time you acted like Jenny's parent? Not Tara and Jenny's parent. When was the last time you spent time alone with Jenny? When was the last time you had a conversation with Jenny that didn't bring up Tara? \n\nTo Jenny it looks like Tara got you (and your husband) for two years while she was banished.

No, she should absolutely not bully her sister, but she clearly doesn\u2019t know how to handle all the emotions that you\u2019re responsible for. You all need some major family counseling if you want any hopes of mending the relationship with your daughter! I\u2019m actually surprised that she came back \u201chome\u201d to live considering how she must of felt. You also need to try and spend some one on one time with her if she\u2019ll agree. She feels like a second class child to you. Seems she also hold you a bit more responsible than her father too which I\u2019m not sure of why, not enough info here to make a call on that. Jenny sees Tara as the reason why she feels and is treated they was she was. It wasn\u2019t Tara\u2019s fault but a young emotional pre-teen who lost her family for 2 years doesn\u2019t see it that way. Stop trying to force a bind with them.

Please get you kid and your entire family some therapy!", "Has Jenny ever had therapy?  It sounds like she resents both you and Tara for being shunted of to her grandmothers so you could focus all your attention on Tara.  Did you have good intentions?  It sounds like you did, but the effect is the same.  Your daughter seems to feel abandoned and less important to you than Tara.

You pushed one daughter away for two whole years, and made a couple phone calls. That\u2019s it?  And now you expect her to be completely ok with being abandoned, both physically and emotionally.  Stop being so damned defensive and get this poor child into therapy, to help her work through both the abandonment *and* being blamed for having feelings about it.", "YTA.

Otherwise I see Jenny going no contact with you once she leaves your house.", "I hate to say it but, YTA, it was never said by either of you that she was coming.

You sent your young daughter to her grandma's because at the time with the other daughters illness you and your husband thought it would be the best way to let her have a normal life while you all dealt with the illness. By the sounds of it your child missed and wanted to come home. You don't say how much you saw or communicated with her while she was gone. You also don't mention if when you did see her all you talked about was Tara. Your child has been away from you for two years and thinks you don't need or want her because her sister is more important. You need to make time for this daughter alone.

I was often the sickly kid, and I think my sisters hated that situation where everyone is soft for me and it feels unfair. But it is also why I think YTA. I would have loved to have my siblings support, rather than the special treatment drift us apart. When you're sick, you need all the help you can get and I grew up really distant to my sisters which I did manage to get closer to the other older sister, my oldest sister completely closed herself to me. I know that you didn't want her life to revolve around her sister, and you want what's best for her. But this ain't it. If you want your family to love each other, love each other fairly. I think if she was involved a bit more, she wouldn't bully her sister. I think she feels like Tara took you guys away, and you're punishing Jenny \"the healthy kid\" by sending her away. I get why she prefers the Dad, because he listens to her. If she wants just a dinner with you, then don't impose more than what she asked. Either way, what is done is done. I think you'd be better off talking to a family counselor of sorts of what's the next best way to deal with this situation as this definitely hurt Jenny.

Because she was ill, of course. But this created also a very intense bond between you and Tara... And now Tata is better, and... It is still not Jenny's time. Tara is always there, it feels as if the two of you where glued at the hip... She doesn't feel that you missed her, that you want to catch up on mother and daughter bonding, that you want to create a special bond between the two of you.

She is now 40 and has since grown out of that. But there was a moment as a teen she was hospitalized into a mental hospital because of things she did that I won't get into.\n\nMy parents didn't have family nearby so me being the youngest I was just kind of left off to the side and I learned early in life that I was essentially invisible if my middle sister was in the room.\n\nSo, yes and no... your eldest is not at fault for an illness she can not control, but your youngest is also not at fault for feeling the way she does, at least she is comfortable confronting you about it.

Do better.", "INFO: have you put either of your daughter's in therapy to help them with these huge life changes they are obviously struggling with?", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. You need family therapy and individual therapy for everyone to deal with what was apparently a life threatening illness. So your oldest almost died and lost her sibling in the process. Your youngest thought her sibling would die and lost both sibling and her parents. You burned yourself out doing nothing but taking care of your daughter in the hospital for 2 years. You said your husband was in a similar situation so I will say the same about his burnout. All of that was massive emotional trauma on multiple levels. So reputable and effective therapists is number one. \n\nFrom your comments though, you\u2019re saying that he is actively dismissing Tara in favor of Jenny and that needs to stop. He needs to make time for both without it involving dismissing the other. Make plans and honor them. \nAs for yourself, don\u2019t include Tara in activities meant to restore your bond with Jenny. You can\u2019t build the family bond until you rebuild the one on one bond with Jenny. It\u2019s going to be a long road, but you still have time. You just have to put in the work.", "NAH.\n\nI read your comments. As a mother myself, I am almost tearing up here. \n\nYou are really struggling here, OP. I see you. \n\nYou have had such a hard time for so long, and you try your best to keep the family together in spite of all that has happened to you. Having a sick child is so hard for a mother. Having to send the other child away must have been awful for you, and you still did it because you focused more on the child's needs than on yourself. On top of all that, your husband had to work very much to finance everything, which made you alone in the hospital with the sick child quite a lot of the time. Unable to share the burden with him. (It was surely hard for him too.)\n\nI believe you are a good mother who truly want what is best for both your children. \n\nI am happy for you that you now can be together again as a family. Do not lose sight of this. You are all alive, you can all live together. This is a good thing.\n\nNow comes the time for mending relationships that have been damaged by the unfortunate events life threw at you.  \n\nThe daughter that got sent away needs you now. She needs her mother first. The relationship between the sisters can wait. \n\nI understand you feel hurt by your daughter's anger towards you, and not towards her father. It feels unfair. And maybe it is. But to us adults, fairness cannot be a part of this. Try to be glad for her, that she has one parent that she feels a little bit better about. It is like when they were little. Often they have a phase where only Daddy is good enough to tuck them in at night. I don't know how many times I felt rejected and grumbling internally \"after all I've done for you... all sleepless nights when Daddy slept and I held you... and this is how you repay me\". But that feeling must stay inside of us. It cannot come out to the child.\n\nI suggest you focus on Jenny now. Start by small bits. Try to get her to talk to you, if just a few minutes a day. Ask about her day, ask about her video games, anything. Then try to get one-on one time with her. Maybe you can drive her somewhere she needs to go? In the car, sometimes it is easier to talk than sitting face to face. She might sulk and sit with her headphones but don't give up. \n\nAfter a few times, maybe stop for an ice cream on the way home? She might not talk much but keep trying. Every little minute you get to spend with her alone is valuable now. And let her understand that you are happy with every time you get to spend with her, that you have missed her, that you want her company. But carefully. Don't hammer it in. Just let her understand it. Full focus on her when she lets you. Stay off your own phone, even if she is on hers. \n\nAfter a while, maybe get her to come for dinner with you? Bribe her if you have to. This is no time for keeping to principles of child-rearing. This is more important. Video games? Candy? Dessert? Clothes shopping? Sure!\n\nStep by step you can make her feel important to you.\n\nOnly after she feels loved and valuable again, can you try to help the sisters regain their relationship. But that comes after.\n\nYou can do this, OP. You are a good mother. You can repair the hurt in your daughter. The hurt is not your fault. It is life. Things happen. But it is your responsibility to reach out to her. She is still young, and was so little when she was sent away. You need to be strong. Still after all these years of hardship you need to be strong like a mother. And you have this strength in you. I know it.", "Yeah. YTA.

She needs to know that you did not want her to be away from you, but that you did what you did so she could still live her life. It may not have been perfect, hell, it may not have been the right choice, but it happened and all you can do is move forward. \n\nI am the youngest sibling of two older sisters who both required a lot of my parents attention. It sucked. As an adult, I can see that they did their best (and that they did it pretty well, honestly) but as a 13 year old, I was sad. I felt less important than my sisters because my problems weren't life threatening. Again, as an adult I understand, but as a kid I felt like a second thought all the time. It's hard. And right now she doesn't need to understand the adult side of it. Right now she needs to feel like a kid, and she needs to process this all as a kid. \n\nApologize to her. Don't make excuses.

I am here now and I want to fix that. I never meant to hurt you, but I understand that I did. I want to make sure that I don't hurt you like again. I want to show you I am sorry and that I love you as much as I love your sister.\" All of that is okay! You DIDN'T mean to hurt her, but unfortunately she was hurt, and it is very valid of her to feel hurt.

Maybe you feel like you did the very best you could to deal with an immensely difficult situation and it\u2019s still not enough. That\u2019s super overwhelming and valid. That said, when we choose to become a parent, it\u2019s our job to look inside ourselves for what our needs are, find a way to take care of them (with the help of other supportive adults in our lives), and check them at the door when it comes to our kids. We have to be able to meet our kids where they are at, hear their needs, approach them with compassion and curiosity, and work to meet them with love and care. The way you describe your child\u2019s behaviour in your post looks as though you are trying to shift blame onto her. A 14 year old. Your child who was uprooted twice. Who lost the love and attention of her parents in formative years. This is traumatic regardless of the reason for it. Her behaviour is a trauma response. She\u2019s bullying Tara bc Tara got all the love and attention from her parents for two years while she was shipped away and abandoned. No matter how valid the reasons, that is damaging as hell, and a child doesn\u2019t know how to process that without help. It shows up in these behaviours she\u2019s displaying.\n\nThe only way to handle this situation is to approach it knowing the above to be true. Knowing that Jenny is the child in this situation, and it\u2019s your job to support her to heal. She doesn\u2019t know how to express and advocate for her needs yet. It\u2019s your job to manage your own and teach her how. Not to criticize how she\u2019s handling this. Please seek some professional support with navigating this.

That does not mean Jenny didn\u2019t take some bruises through this, and she clearly needs some undivided attention. Give it to her, just as you did her sister.

Please listen to this one and try to ignore the harsh judgement of others. \nI too have 2 daughters, 3.5yrs apart. My oldest was sick for a long time starting around 12, long story and not pertinent.

Unfortunately, I did MY best with the tools I had available. I cannot express this to my now 16yr old because it means nothing to her - and rightfully so. What she needs to know is mom screwed up, mom loves her unconditionally, mom wants to make it better. \nYour daughter needs to know 1. You love her as much and unconditionally. 2. You screwed up 3. Your relationship with her a priority.\nI say \u201cyou screwed up\u201d because she is hurt and it\u2019s because of your actions. That does not mean you could have done things differently. Every decision has a consequence and this is the consequence of deciding the physical health of one is priority to the emotional health of the other. You did what most loving mothers would have done - first we keep them alive and physically healthy, emotional health is secondary. You are dealing with the fallout that many loving mothers have to address. \nFrom there you make a point to show her how she is important and how the relationship between you two is important to YOU. \nUse your words and actions and put a little extra focus on Jenny. It will get better. If you do this then when she is much older she will understand why you did what you did and will grant you grace.

To her, you sent her away without a second thought when your favourite daughter was sick, and you only deigned to allow Jenny back into your life when it was convenient for you. I'm not saying that's your actual thought process, but it's definitely what she's seeing and how she's feeling. \n\nI grew up feeling discarded and unwanted by my mom just like Jenny is feeling now. My mom got a new family and suddenly I was disposable and worthless. It's too late for my mother and I to make amends now, but it isn't too late for you and Jenny. I highly recommend doing some individual and family therapy so that you, Jenny, and the rest of your family can express how they're feeling and what they're thinking in a pressure-free, moderated environment.", "Yeah. You sent a kid away. Wth. That's not cool. She is never going to get over that.", "Yes to everything except that Tara needs to work to rebuild the relationship. We have no evidence that she did anything wrong here, she didn't ask for OP to drop Jenny and cater to only her. She's probably also going through a really emotionally vulnerable time right now.\n\nShe's also a child, one who is seeing her sister hold a ton of resentment for her through no fault of her own. While Jenny is not really to be blamed, this is all on OP, I wouldn't force Tara to go running after Jenny to... what? Apologize for something she didn't do and had no control over? Just so Jenny can lash out at Tara and make her feel guilty?\n\nAgain, this is NOT on Jenny, she is right to have her feelings. But it is not right to make Tara bear the brunt of those feelings. OP needs to step up. There's no need to force Tara to build a relationship with Jenny right now when both of them are so vulnerable, and that burden should not be on Tara.", "\ud83c\udfc5 \ud83e\udd48 \ud83c\udf96 \n\nHere is my poor man's reward. You articulated everything I wanted to say", ">the other was sent away without a thought.\n\nI have to disagree specifically with this part. They did have to think about it - and I don't think if she had stayed it would've been any better. She still would've felt alone and abandoned due to her sister being sick, but staying at home would've meant she was at the hospital all the time.\n\nI think this is a lose-lose situation with the only win being that Tara is still with her family.", "Agree with everything you said except the Tara needs to work on rebuilding her relationship with her sister. Tara has done absolutely nothing wrong", "You say it like it was all me. My husband did it too. But she is fine with him. I'm the only one to blame right? I mean of course she is not going to blame her dad when all he does is buy her whatever she wants and do whatever she says but whatever I do is wrong", "Children are just like pets though, right? Rehome them when you don't have time and take them back when you do. You wouldn't want to visit them in person either, that will just make them miss you more. /s", "Can confirm, and I was allowed to remain in the family home. YTA op if for nothing else than not understanding your daughter's position in all of this. You had to focus on your sick kid, yes, that was important, but you didn't have to shove the other away like an inconvenient pet. She was pushed aside and she's pissed about it. Dinner was an opportunity for the two of you to spend time alone together like her sister had for 2 years. Put some serious quality time in with her (just the two of you!!!!) before you ruin any chance of a relationship at all. Don't push her yo have a relationship with her sister. It will just drive her away.", "This captures what I wanted to say as well. OP is clearly disdainful towards Jenny and blind to her own preference.", "\"you don't seem to care a lot anyway.\" Really seems to encompass the problem.", "Not to mention after two years in the new place she was probably making friends and feeling settled and whelp, time to move you again because we are ready for you to come home now, so once again she uprooted and unsettled.", "This is it exactly. \n\nAnd also: it\u2019s completely normal to want to spend time with your kids one-on-one even in completely normal, but lopsided families. I spend time with my children individually as well as together, because shocker, I like them.", "No visits to her, a few visits back home. Sounds rough.", "Everything is about Tara in the moms mind.", "I bet she still went with Tara anyway. Just because Jenny changed her mind about going doesn't mean they should waste their reservation, right? Eurgh. My heart is breaking for Jenny.", "Read the comments from OP she is most definitely biased toward Tara.", "You have the daughters mixed up, it was the older one who was sick and the younger one that was sent to MIL.", "This. She needs therapy, and you all need group family therapy. This was a traumatizing experience for everyone. I understand your reasoning for sending her to your MIL and I'm not here to say if it was the right or wrong choice. But of COURSE Jenny feels separate because she was literally sent away from the rest of the family. Not to mention leaving all her friends and attending a different school for 2 years, I'm assuming? Again, this was an awful situation and you had to make tough choices. But now that Tara is healed you all have some healing to do too", "Honestly, I\u2019m seeing a future where Tara lives with dad and Jenny lives with mom.", "Exactly! You say you want them to bond as sisters as well but Jenny isn\u2019t ready yet. Take one step at a time. Think about it from Jenny\u2019s perspective.\n\nWhile Tara was having the worst moments of her life, you were there. Jenny was also having the worst moments of hers: she had to live in a new environment with new rules and her sister was very sick (possibly dying).  Jenny didn\u2019t have her parents to help get her through that, she probably felt like she was figuring it all out alone. Yeah, an adult who has had some life experiences could probably have the perspective (and emotional tools) to deal, but she didn\u2019t.\n\n I don\u2019t think sending her to live with your MIL was the wrong choice, but I do think you\u2019re fumbling now by clearly not empathizing with Jenny\u2019s emotional needs. I think you want to, but you\u2019re stuck on hyper-caretaker mode with Tara. You need to make sure Jenny feels safe and secure the same way you did for Tara.", "They never visited her. They called \u201cregularly\u201d, but Jenny was visiting them, the parents never went to the MILs house over the two years.  \n\nIf Jenny wanted to see her parents she was expected to make the effort.", "This is the point where I start thinking, this can\u2019t be real right? What parent would be ok with not visiting or not having some sort of monthly visit schedule where MIL brings her down for a weekend or she takes public transportation? It makes no sense to me. I mean, maybe I just know really overbearing parents but my experiences of moms/dads is that this wouldn\u2019t be bearable for them. I know OP is taking heat here but the lack of info about dad as well makes me wonder", "She said they never visited cause \u201cthey couldn\u2019t\u201d but she came home a few times. I\u2019m surprised she came home at all. I would have stayed where I was wanted.", "Occasional (not regular) phone calls, no visits. Jenny came home for visits 5 times in the 2 years.", "I don\u2019t want to assume but from Op comments and from the clear signs that Op still puts Tara in a pedestal.. I will assume that Jenny will be all happy and joyfully.. and to accept Tara as her sister.. \n\nI think she doesn\u2019t have resentment towards her dad because he did try to keep a distance relationship with her or that he gave her space until she was comfortable with him or that he is actively trying to fix the relationship and make time for her.", "The dynamic is above Reddit, but the more the OP responds the clearer it is she's being TA. She has misguided expectations and her own set of emotional traumas to deal with. But the way she talks about her daughter and husband... She is showing she would be a pill to be around for anyone not named Tara. That must change before too much more damage is done.", "Not to mention they also didn\u2019t visit Jenny for the 2 years she was away. She came home \u201ca few times\u201d. \n\nYeah, I wonder why the 14 yo isn\u2019t thrilled to be around her mom and sister.", "OP appears to have zero empathy for Jenny.  That\u2019s what\u2019s so concerning.  No wonder Jenny wonders if her mom loves her.  I sure wonder that myself.", "Agreed. Soft YTA. Getting Jenny, and likely the entire family, therapy might go a long way towards helping. Look, I get it, when you have a seriously chronically ill child your entire focus and life because helping them live. I had that situation. But at the same time you cannot lose sight of the fact that you have another healthy daughter who needs you just as much as Tara. Being able to navigate the needs of both girls isn't easy, but you need to change some behaviors and put some effort into making Jenny feel like part of the family too. This is a big reason I have always oppose sending kids away when a parent or sibling is seriously ill. They are part of the family, and big feelings will pop up. Don't isolate them. Kids will feel like they've been rejected by everyone.", "You got the names flipped I believe", "You interchanged the names I think.", "You mixed up the sisters. Tara was the sick one, not Jenny. Jenny was the one who was sent away and who OP continues to emotionally neglect.", "But op said she called when they could, doesn\u2019t that count for something /s", "730 days of total failure\u2026.", "By sending her away you took away a valuable bonding experience between sisters. \nJenny would have been more aware of what's going on and and she might have developed empathy for her sister instead of animosity", "Yeah I initially thought this was a soft YTA too but it\u2019s a full blown yikes from me at several of OP\u2019s comments, unfortunately.", "THATS WHAT IM SAYING!\n\nOp should answer these questions because it will make it more clear why Jenny is treating Tara that way. There is something Op is clearly hiding if she is still putting how Tara feels above how Jenny feels. That relationship will take months.. or years to be repaired. I will say Op NEEDS to take it slow and should be speeding time 1 on 1 with only Jenny.\n\n\nI have resentment towards my little brother but I don\u2019t blame him for it.. I blame my parents for making me feel that way. Always showing favoritism, always showing him more love and understanding. But when it came to me I either was told to act my age, manage my anger problems or to shut up if I don\u2019t want to lose my life.", "This. Everyone saying yta seems to be putting their own trauma into the mix.", "It's really not though. OP abandoned her daughter, probably at a very scary time given that the daughter's sister was in the hospital for two years, and now is trying to act like nothing happened. And when the daughter tries to tell her parents why she's upset, and clearly states she wants one on one time with her mom, her feelings are dismissed.\n\nWhile they 100% need therapy, it is very, very clearly a YTA situation. You don't just get to abandon your child for two years then act like nothing happened and be completely perplexed as to why the child may be upset.", "OP states they didn't even visit Jenny. They called her. On the phone. Having one sick child doesn't mean you just get to ship out the healthy one and bring her home when its convienent again 2 years later. Mom and dad did not need to spend every second of every day with Tara. I had a sick child. My husband and I took turns so that our other 2 kids still had a mom and dad. Life was difficult but we faced it as a family. I can't even imagine sending one of my kids away for 2 years. That's just messed up.", "Spot on.  \n\nJenny feels neglect due to the time and attention you rightfully dedicated to Tara and is acting out because of it.  Teenagers sometimes behave irrationally due to their physical, emotional, and hormonal changes.  \n\nExplain to her you love her no less than you love Tara.  You and your husband had to spend more time on Tara because of her illness and not because of favoritism.  Good luck to your family.\n\nNTA", "It also sounds like OP is trying to micromanage the sister's relationship. It would not be that hard to plan a girls night with Jenny without Tara there. Tara has had two years, Jenny deserves one night.", "This family is a mess. Both kids are going to be so traumatised.", "Agree, but OP needs to stop pushing a bond with her sister. Jenny needs therapy to process her anger and resentment. Pushing a relationship will only root those feeling more.", "Yea as a silver lining, this is very common and has a lot of research and evidence based practice behind it. Nothing that OP can navigate with effort and time. I just hope Jenny is able to work through her feelings, I\u2019m glad she has atleast found solace in her dad", "Did you really just accuse Jenny, a child who was thrown out of her home by her parents when she was 12, of being a bully for wanting attention from her mother after she spent two years in a whole other city with zero visits from her parents? I hope you don't have kids because they are in for a wild fucking ride with your absolute 0 emotional intelligence.\n\nOP was fine spending two years on Tara with literally zero effort to even see Jenny, while she can't even spend a single night with Jenny without Tara. I can't imagine the pain Jenny must be feeling, OP makes it so clear that Tara is the only one she cares about. Meanwhile if you read her comments, she even resents her husband for showing some affection to Jenny.", "I want to say I agree but my question is how is Tara reacting to Jenny being there and having 1 parent attention a lot. Or how is Tara as a person before Jenny left. There is so many questions that I bet op will dogged because it will show the people how much she cares about her daughters and how she views the relationship.", "There's no evidence that the dad's ignoring Tara, at all. All OP said is that Jenny only spends time with him, not that he only spends time with her. The dad doesn't deserve any blame in this.", "She only visited with her daughter less than 5 times in two years.  She is TA just for that reason.", "This was posted 40 mins ago?", "She said they never visited, but that Jenny visited them a couple of times. So her parents never even came to what was her home, never saw her room, didn't meet her friends. I would be heartbroken.", "Wow. Thank you!", "Not even on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or her birthday? That's crazy.", "What a mess. I have more sympathy for her than most people do here - dad was working two jobs to keep them afloat and mum was in the hospital trying to hold it together - but Jenny really did get sacrificed in all this. \n\nTo me the real villain of the story though is a healthcare system where a parent has to work two jobs to pay for medical needs for their child. What a different situation this would have been if that wasn\u2019t the case,", "Yes. I'm the other sibling. I'm also the oldest. I was expected to act like an adult in many ways long before I was an actual adult. My emotional needs were frequently ignored. It took a lot of therapy for me to even realize how inappropriately my parents treated me due to my sibling's illnesses.", "Definitely some truth to that, my little sister was born with a serious lifelong illness and I had a lot of resentment while I was growing up and didn\u2019t truly understand why all the time they were in the hospital with her and I was being sent to be with my aunt and uncle or grandparents place", "Yasssss. A just them thing!! And having it scheduled weekly or biweekly is great. Once you set the days dont let anything change it. That'll feel unimportant so make sure it's a day or time you can commit to Jenny.", "Uh, they both need therapy. What\u2019s with this disregard for the child who had to endure the trauma of 2 years of hospitals? Both have had it extremely rough - one lost their parents for 2 years, and one lost all semblance of normality, structure, faith in their own body, and spent 2 years in constant pain. Both are extremely unsettling, and to say only the former requires therapy is short sighted.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s an easy ride being diagnosed with a major illness or acquiring a disability?", "Very well said!!", "Poor Jenny.", "That makes me incredibly sad for Jenny :( OP will be one of those moms acting confused when her daughter goes NC when she's older. The fact she had to ask this question shows how out of touch she is with that poor child's feelings.", "What would have been the right move in this scenario?  It sounds like the options were:\n\n1. Both kids effectively live in a hospital for 2 years \n2. Leave a sick kid alone in the hospital for large swaths of time for 2 years\n3. Send the healthy kid to MIL's in hopes she can live a \"more normal\" life for 2 years\n\n14 year olds aren't self-sufficient or rational.  If they had tried to give Jenny a normal life at home or some compromised form of it they'd have a scared and hurt 15 year old bitter at being left alone in the hospital while her sister gets to eat breakfast and dinner with mom at home.\n\nEvery option sounds terrible, option #3 sounds like the least terrible?  I'm not saying she's not the AH in this particular instance, but I don't know that there was any right move.", "Agreed, neither daughter is to blame here, they\u2019re both just kids.", "So Tara should never be forced to make amends. That I agree.\n\nAnd I hope I didnt imply that Tara had any responsibility for amends. The responsibility of amends is STRICTLY on the parents. The parents are at fault and no one else. Tara didn't chose to be sick or send her sister away. That's the parents.\n\nThe only thing I feel Tara should have is a simple understanding that her parents treated her sister really shitty while she was sick and that has cause some major resentment . While it's not her fault at all, she shouldn't be on team \"push relationship\" and to just let it be for now. Don't push herself onto her sister and let her the time she needs to heal. And to just stay out of the parents part too. She should focus on her health and not what her parents did.\n\nEdit: sorry phone made me think this was a reply to my comment not a brand new one.", ">*but staying at home would've meant she was at the hospital all the time*.\n\nRespectfully disagree. Tara has a mom and a dad in the picture. They did not both need be with Tara all the time. Parents of sick kids do it all the time. My husband and I had to do it. It is possible to still parent your healthy kids. Not ship them off for 2 years.", "The reason I stand by this statement is for the simple fact is OP never visited her daughter. Not once. Jenny if she wanted to see them was required to go to THEM. Not the other way around.\n\nOP couldn't tell you how her daughters new room was decorated or what the colors the walls were. Because they never stepped foot in that room.\n\nJenny was expected to do the labor of visits while OP felt other than that calls were sufficient.\n\nTwo years. And they NEVER went to visit their daughter and left everything on that little girls shoulders. \n\nThat's why I feel it their wasn't a thought about sending her away", "Yeah, it feels like you'd need way more information to judge the sending her to live with her grandmother part.  Dad's working two jobs and if we assume mom really did need to be with the other daughter the whole time, what should they have done?  If they sent her across the country for two years and never saw or spoke to her that would be messed up, but if it was nearby and they were still in her life that seems like a reasonable idea.  In the end it doesn't really matter much for this situation though, because it would be totally reasonable for her to want some one on one time with her mother even absent all the rest.", "OP never mentioned how the daughter felt about it. Did she even want to go live with her family?", "They never even visited her when she was away. She didn't see her parents for two entire years.", "It would have been better if she had stayed. My 3 year old had cancer and he has 3 older siblings. We did everything we could to keep their lives as normal as possible. They did he a to spend some nights with family or friends but they stayed in the same schools and same after school activities and visited in the hospital when they could. This child was completely abandoned by her parents for the sick sister. They handled this completely wrong. There was no need to send her away. They could have taken turns being at the hospital with Tara or home with Jenny", "She was 12, no kid this age can completely grasp it might be better.\nAnd I doubt OP and husband spend 2 years 24h/7days at the hospital, and even so, they have 2 children, one does not deserves to be sent away for 2 years like a random package for the sake of the other", "She likes Dad because Dad is making an effort to spend one on one time with her. Maybe Dad is dropping the ball on home stuff, or cooking, or cleaning, or helping Tara and he should be stepping up so you get to spend time with Jenny. \n\nBut if you INSIST on bringing Tara into any bonding time or just ANYTHING with Tara you're going to ruin all of your relationships. Talk with Jenny. Say you're sorry and you fucked up doing what you thought was the best solution at the worst of times. Tell her you love her dearly and never mean to hurt her. DONT MENTION TARA.\n\nStart doing a hobby together that's just you and Jenny. You could diamond painting, cross stitch, embroidery, take a sewing class, go to the gym, movie night once a week. You can also do a night with Tara too, but don't bring her to the ones with your other daughter. And make sure it's a different activity Christ on a Cracker. \n\nBut you need to step up here and show your daughter you love her. Stop being defensive. Don't argue with her. Let her be angry: she's 14, you didn't visit her for TWO YEARS, you sent her away and she feels like you abandoned her. And you kinda did OP. She has every right to be mad. \n\nSay sorry. She'll respect you more for it.", "Hearing it laid out like this... Doing what this woman did with her human daughter would be sooo cruel to do to even a pet... Now I dislike OP even more", "This is too harsh. Having a sick child is really tough and the position may have been either Jenny is dragged to the hospital with no one to take her to and from school, no one to make her dinner etc, no chance of normalcy\u2026 or go to grandmas. Remember, dads working two jobs and mums essentially on her own here. \n\nI hope Jenny got a say in whether she toughed it out at home or if she went away, as well as if and when she came back but still. You need a little empathy for the mum even if she is TA in this instance.", "Man, the visits were also expected from Jenny, huh. \n\nTotally get that OP had to ship Jenny off to take care of Tara as it could take a toll, but as she's stable now, OP should focus on Jenny too.", "I have empathy for her, Tara is doing better so Mom figured the family could go back to normal, completely neglecting what Jenny went through.  Actually turns out I don\u2019t have as much empathy as I thought.\nEdit: typo", "Thanks, I'll fix it now", "Yes. Also when you bring up therapy, don't make it like Jenny is the only one who needs it. It will only make her feel even more isolated. You all went through hard things together in different ways.", "Jenny hates her mom and Tara why would she live with her mom", "Maybe if they get their own Bravo show first.", "Yeah, that's pretty bogus. I saw that in OP's follow-up comments. Interesting she chose not to mention the fact that she completely abandoned her daughter for 2 years and now she's acting shocked that Jenny wants nothing to do with her.", "Jesus wept. If I was Jenny I wouldn\u2019t have went back. What a shitty pair of \u201cparents\u201d. I get the other kid was sick but that excuse never visiting.", "Right. It's a little bizarre that OP was able to basically cut out the rest of the world to solely focus on her daughter. But the fact that she made the choice to not leave the hospital for 2 years to see her other daughter and not give her husband the chance to spend some 1:1 time with Tara is just straight up weird.", "Yeah I started off at \u201csoft YTA\u201d but every comment from OP pushes me further into the view that she\u2019s  doing everything except look for ways to improve the situation. It\u2019s a real shame for the rest of the family.", "Well shit.im going to fix that now", "I get op is trying to fix the damage, but dinners ain't gonna cut it.", "Jesus. Poor kid.", "Thanks I didnt saw that, definetly the AH in that case.\n\nHopefully she will understand now and will try to repair the relationship", "Exactly this. Messed up. Who the fuck just ships off their kid? Then has no idea why she is upset with her. Glad lots of people in the comments are echoing this. Hopefully it will be a wake up call for the OP, but she seems to be oblivious to other points of view so far. Looking forward to the update/edit", "OP specified that Jenny has been bullying Tara. Did you even read the post? Hell did you even read my comment? I specifically addressed her feeling are understandable, but her actions (the bullying OP specifically mentioned) were unacceptable. Sounds like you shouldn't have kids with how easy you fly off the handle because you didn't pay attention to the details.", "She said in another comment the Dad is dropping anything Tara needs to tend to Jenny. So he basically reversed kids.", "Yeah, the follow up responses from OP tell the full story. OP needs therapy, she is holding her own set of resentment to Jenny and husband. OP's world clearly still revolves around Tara. I get that due to the last 2 years, but she has to adjust or the others in her life will move on...", "Thats....even worse", "Welcome!", "Sorry you had to go through that.", "Sometimes there just isn't a right move", "OP lost me when she said neither parents visited their own child in person for 2 years. Oh, but Jenny visited home \"a few times\". If OP can't be bothered to focus on Jenny now, how focused was she during her calls when Tara was in the hospital?\n\nAnd now Jenny's dragged back home. How many friends did she lose both times moving? What normalcy did she have when her exile didn't have an end date. If Tara gets sick again will Jenny be shipped away again?\n\nIt's still parental neglect.\n\nAlthough could be ragebait with OP's latest comment about how she's the better parent because she used to call more than the dad.", "Yeah, if you read her replies, she just isn\u2019t getting it.", "It sounds like she\u2019s more annoyed that Jenny doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her precious Tara, then actually wanting a relationship with Jenny herself.", "I did.  She is the worst.  I have two kids.  The youngest has ASD, and I know sometimes the oldest gets lost in the shuffle. I acknowledge that because it is real and try super hard to always find time for the two of us.  No parent is perfect and I fail a lot but she is completely incapable of seeing what they put Jenny through.  12 to 14 are super important years for a girl, in all likelihood her mother missed so many milestones.", "It really does, and that's a shame. Micromanaging her daughters' relationship with each other is not going to be helpful here. I also wonder how Tara feels about all this. She didn't ask to be sick. She may not have even wanted her mom on top of her all the time. She didn't get a choice about that either. Mom has made a right mess of things but doesn't seem to take much responsibility for those choices.", "She comments that Tara has asked her dad to take her places (ends up being thwarted by Jenny, but that\u2019s not the point), so it sounds like she\u2019d like some time away from her Mom. \n\nI would guess that everyone but Mom wants some one on one time with each other.", "Mom needs a therapist. I'm sure she's got some sort of issues as a result of what's happened with Tara. Tara needs to reestablish relationships with her dad and sister but Mom needs to stay the heck out of it and let them sort out their own issues. She definitely shouldn't be mediating things between the sisters because Mom is a sore spot that brings up resentment. This is a messy situation that they really need the help of a professional to navigate."]}
