I won't get into details for privacy but we went through hell. For 2 years I had to be in the hospital all the time and my husband had to work 2 jobs to be able to pay for the hospital\n\nWe decided that the best thing to do for Jenny would be to send her to live with my MIL who lives in another city. She is the only close family we have. We were trying to give Jenny a normal life otherwise she would spend all her time in a hospital like us.\n\nNow that Tara is better, things are a lot better and we asked Jenny to come back home and she was glad to do so however she only ever spends time with her dad, never with me or Tara and she never says why she doesn't want to spend time with us. Not just that she also actively bullies Tara any chance she gets\n\nLast night her dad managed to convince her to go out to dinner with me. Tara and I got ready and we were waiting for Jenny. She came out of her room and saw us there, turned to my husband and said she changed her mind and went back to her room. I followed her and asked what's wrong. She started screaming at me asking me if I have to include Tara in everything. She accused me of not enjoying spending my time with her and \"bringing Tara so that I could spend time with Tara and pretend to like Jenny\" I told her this is not true and I was just trying to have a girls night with both of my daughters but she screamed at me to get out and called me an asshole and other names\n\nEdit: I'm making this edit to explain some things\n\nIt's clear that none of you ever had to look after a sick child. You keep asking me why I didn't visit as if I could just leave her alone(yes, alone, because my husband was at work all the time) how could I do that? I did everything I could. I called Jenny almost every day and I tried to be involved in her life as much as possible.\n\nNow she is trying to make sure Tara is neglected and I should just do it? Tara was sick for 2 years, she is finally starting to have a normal life and I should just neglect her like her dad? And what is the point really? Talking from exprience, Jenny would be on her phone ignoring me the entire time, this way at least I had someone to talk to when Jenny was so busy ignoring me.\n\nI love her, I know she is just a kid but I expected her to be a bit more mature than this. I'm just so tired of everything. \n\nI'll talk to Jenny and plan to get dinner just the 2 of us another night and see if she is willing however I will never give in to all her demands and neglect Tara because of her which is what my husband is doing", "created_utc": 1676293865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1117vy2/aita_for_including_both_of_my_daughters/", "score": 5620, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

INFO: did you not see your daughter for 2 years while Tara was in the hospital?", "In this instance, YTA. Obviously Jenny shouldnt bully Tara, but shes 14 and she needs her mom too, and it sounds like you have had a lot of your focus on Tara. As shes 14, i bet she doesnt know how to articulate her needs, but in this case, it was quite obvious. She clearly expected it was a dinner between just the two of you so you shouldnt have included Tara.", "YTA, you need to rebuild your relationship you had with Jenny. Basically the message she got over the last 2 years is that you chose Tara. She resents Tara for that and blames you. Some family therapy, therapy Jenny individually and the girls together could be helpful", "INFO How long was Jenny living away from the nuclear family? Did anyone visit Jenny whilst she was at your MIL\u2019s?", "Jenny: I\u2019m finally gonna get a chance to talk to my mom one on one about the way I\u2019m feeling and why I lash out when she always makes me include my sister that I\u2019m resentful of.\n\nMom: We\u2019re bringing your sister!\n\nJenny: Asshole!!!\n\nMom: shocked pikachu face", "YTA. You have to be able to spend 1-on-1 time with Jenny or you're going to lose her. Tara got you, in person, for the last 2 years. She hasn't gotten you at all. She hasn't had a mom for 2 years. Tara has. \n\nAnd you decided that the one time she agrees to spend time with YOU, not Tara, not the whole family, YOU, was the perfect time to force her sister into the picture again? And prove exactly her point, that you don't care about Jenny without Tara but can care about Tara without Jenny?", "YTA. Soft YTA, but you have some work to do.\n\nTara basically got two years of your uninterrupted one on one time while Jenny got uprooted. Twice.\n\nTara got emotional support from you in a difficult time. Jenny got shipped to Grandma.\n\nYou did what you thought was best for your family in a really tough situation and I am not going to second guess you. If I would wish anything for a family in that tight spot, it is loving grandparents able to shelter anyone who needs it. But now you need to do some healing with Jenny.\n\nJenny also went through hard stuff, and she went through it without your support. She did middle school without her old friends, and now she gets to transition into high school without her new ones. She has spent some incredibly formative years away and if you are going to repair this relationship, you need to give her some dedicated space and attention. A dinner or activity with just the two of you once a week would be a good start. Girls night with both your girls is going to need to wait a while.\n\nIncidentally, the hospital may have social work resources available to your family even though the immediate health concern is resolved. Please ask.", "INFO: How long was Jenny with your in laws?", "INFO: Why would you even think of bringing Tara along if this was supposed to be a dinner about your relationship with Jenny?", "YTA \n\nYour daughter needs individual therapy, family therapy, and 1:1 time. For 2 years, she was sent away from the family. Come back, and everything still includes Tara. This dinner was presented as dinner with Mom. That\u2019s what she agreed to. Not dinner with Tara. This is your wake-up call.", "YTA \n\nI\u2019ve read your comments and you refuse to realise that you need to put in effort to rebuild your relationship with her individually. You\u2019re so focused on her bonding with her sister so you can pretend everything is okay and no harm was done as the result of you sending her away.\n\nWake up.", "YTA in that if she\u2019s having this meltdown you clearly haven\u2019t put in the work to reconnect with her.", "YTA. Spend time with Jenny ALONE. Make her feel special. She\u2019s obviously hurt and resentful Tara got you alone for 2 years regardless of the reasons behind it. Family therapy is also indicated. She\u2019s crying out that she needs some TLC and you only thing about bonding with Tara when she obviously isn\u2019t ready for that.", "INFO: how did you & your husband explain to your then-12 year old daughter that you were going to send her to your MIL and never go visit her during those two years?", "YTA \"Out to dinner with me\"=/=\"Out to dinner with her sister and me.\" Bait and switch and then blame the victim of the deceit.  This is exactly why we can tell Jenny's assessment of your relationship is spot on. You are a self serving liar and she knows it. You sent her to the MIL because it was easier for you and no other reason.", "YTA. I know one daughter was sick, but you\u2019ve neglected mothering your other child and she is craving your love. You can\u2019t seem to give it to her unless your special child is there. At least that\u2019s how you\u2019re making it look to her.", "Being the sibling of a sick kid is extremely difficult. In Jenny\u2019s case, she was quite literally sent away so all focus could be on Tara. \n\nI say this delicately, but YTA for depriving your daughter of the one on one time she so desperately needs. Jenny is dealing with a lot of emotions right now. 14 is a tough age, but consider everything she went through while away from her family.", "After reading all the comments, YTA. You want to force a relationship on YOUR schedule. Jenny is not yet ready to be close to Tara. That doesnt mean Jenny should be able to bully Tara, but you are the ahole for insisting Tara come to a dinner that should have been about you reconnecting with Jenny.", "YTA. You need to put in INDIVIDUAL time with Jenny. Stop trying to force her to bond with Tara. All you're going to do is tear them apart further. Get family therapy, right now.\n\nTara got your undivided attention for 2 years and Jenny got ignored. You mention in a comment that you didn't/couldn't visit, but you \"called\". You abandoned Jenny. That's how she feels about it. It's now your job to repair the trust you lost with her.", "YTA.\n\nYou sent her AWAY. You did. You put everything into one daughter and the other was sent away without a thought.\n\nNow you expect her to be fine with you? With Tara? In her eyes Tara is the main reason why she didn't get a family for two years. How often did you visit? Spend time with Jenny when she was sent to a TOTALLY DIFFERENT CITY. The poor girl even had to switch schools for two years. \n\nYou abandoned one daughter for the other and now expects her to just be happy to spend time with y'all? It don't work like that. You AND your husband need to work on rebuilding a relationship with her. IF she even wants it. You cannot force it. She deserves the right to decide if she even wants it or not.\n\nI know Tara was sick and I'm glad she's okay now but you still abandoned your youngest daughter and she sees it. She sees that when it came down to it....Tara comes first and that's hard to mend.\n\nYou fucked up now you gotta deal with it.\n\nAlso this could've been a good step to reconnect but you dropped the ball when Tara was included after Jenny spent years of being separated from yall and could've used one on one time\n\nEdit: Brain went meh. Meant husband not Tara.\n\nTara's a innocent party in this", "YTA for telling her she was invited to dinner with you and then it was both you and her sister. You know there are difficulties there, so you should have been clear about who was going to dinner. Also BTW your headline is disingenuous. Furthermore, you\u2019re probably TA for sending Jenny away like out-of-season holiday decorations. She might feel that you didn\u2019t want her around because you were busy with the sibling that was more important to you. This family needs individual and family therapy. And the Mom and Dad need to stop being AH.", "You spent nearly every moment with one of your children and not the other for two years. You sent her away- whatever good reason you thought you had, that was a profound abandonment. And now you seem to be refusing to spend any time alone with her to help reestablish some kind of relationship between just the two of you?  I\u2019m not surprised she was incandescent with rage. YTA. Please get some family therapy. You\u2019ve all been through a profound trauma and you\u2019ve got very little time left with Jenny at home.", "Different genders and ages, but I lived this as the 'well' child. I applied for emancipation at 16, to the suprise of my family, made a clear case and won. Next talked to them again around my late-20's. While she is still reactive and emotional you have a chance for therapy to work. Once she stops being angry, understand she's done with the bullshit. You can't undo what you already did, but if you want any kind of relationship with your daughter - therapy ASAP, and stop trying to defend and justify the abandonment and neglect. The why dosen't matter to a child. Just that IT HAPPENED.", " God, my heart is broken for Jenny. \n\nYTA. You abandoned your daughter for years, never visited, at a huge developmental stage of her life, and now you\u2019re mad at her because she isn\u2019t just happy to be back with you? You say she likes her dad because he buys her things, well at least he\u2019s trying to do something to make her feel wanted and special. What are you doing for her, to make up for years of neglect?\n\nI say this as a mom to a daughter, you are never getting that child back in your life if you don\u2019t drastically change your attitude here and realize the harm your choices have caused your daughter. These are formative years and all she knows us that her mom doesn\u2019t want her around.", "OP,  Jenny just spelled out to you LOUDLY, what she wants from you.  She wants one on one time with you.  No Tara involved.  She has been playing second fiddle to Tara since Tara got sick.  In her eyes, you even shipped her off to MIL because Tara was more important to you, than Jenny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.  You need to put Jenny in therapy.  You need to start family therapy ASAP.  This is not going to get better unless you start doing the work needed to rebuild your relationship with Jenny alone.  No Tara.  Those girls will have to work that out themselves.", "YTA. Op your daughters life was ruined by her sister, and while it wasn't intentional it'll still have long lasting effects on her. You should spend one on one time with her, and after a while of doing that try and the two of them to do stuff together.", "Glass Child syndrome. Look it up, get help. \n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nTara had you for 2 years alone and you can\u2019t even give her a night just the two of you? You need family therapy and you need it now, she needs to talk about her feelings in a neutral place, just you, your hubby and Jenny", "I would love to write something gentle and kind because I know how hard it is to have a sick child\u2026but reading your comments it\u2019s painfully obvious that you not only do not want to understand Jenny, you harbor disdain for her (understandable) behavior and you are not doing anything to make Jenny feel accepted and part of the family. You have abandoned her completely for 2 years, saw her handful of times in those two years, have no real interest in her, and you keep pushing Tara on her. You still think only of Tara, it\u2019s obvious she is the golden child.\nJenny also lived deep trauma when her sister got sick, and on top of that she was abandoned at her grandma, away from family and friends, her whole life uprooted\u2026I bet you all the video games in the world that Jenny felt and feel unlovable, unloved, and not part of your family.\nIt seems that even though Tara is, thankfully, healthy you have lost one of your daughters anyway. But it\u2019s ok, you don\u2019 t seem to care a lot anyway. \nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou spent two years with Tara in the hospital, yes she was sick and you worried but Jenny was without you for two years. Least you can do is to spend some alone time with her! \n\nAlso while in the hospital how much did you comunicate with her?\n\nShe spend time with your husband because I immagine she sow him at least.", "So you left Jenny away from her family for nearly 2 years and you thought you'd get to play happy family the minute you take her back like the 2 years never happened?\n\nIts understandable that you had to prioritise Tara's health, but you abandoned Jenny for 2 years. You'll have to earn your way back.\n\nAlso, how much communication you had with Jenny in those 2 years. Like you had daily phone calls, weekly visits, etc?\n\nYTA even without the additional info.", "INFO: how much time did you and your husband spend with jenny when she was staying at her grandma? How often did you call her etc?\n\nFrom your text i get the feeling you didn't visit her very often and when you did it was mostly her dad who went to see her. \n\nIf this is correct, jennys reaction is more than understandable. She got sent away, removed from her own family w/o any fault of her own and from her pov only her dad cared enough for her to see her. Andnow, when she could finally came home, she doesn't get any quality time with only you either. For her you just confirmed her pov that you don't care about her :(", "OP, you sent your daughter away for years to take care of your other child.\n\nDo you seriously not have the ability to grasp why she is upset?", "YTA, this isn\u2019t about Tara.  It\u2019s about you and Jenny.  Their bond as sisters isn\u2019t for you to manage.  Jenny thought she was going to get to spend some time with her mother, and you changed that without a thought as to what Jenny needs.  I am so happy for you that Tara is doing better but that doesn\u2019t change what Jenny experienced and she needs to be supported as well.", "OP you need to spend time one on one with Jenny ASAP. You need to listen to her and her feelings, and you need to do this without bringing up Tara, Tara's illness, or how hard YOU had it.\n\nYou need to tell her that you love her, that you missed her horribly, and that from now on you will be there for her.\n\nYes it was hell for all of you, but your daughter is just a kid. A kid who went two years without her parents. All this was traumatic for her too, and now she needs reassurance that you love her just as much as Tara, that you worry about her, that you want to be closer to her.\n\nYou are going to have to work on this relationship in order for it to heal. You are losing your daughter. In four years she'll be an adult, unless you do something by then don't expect to hear from her once she moves out. Spend time with her, just her. Listen to her thoughts, spoil her a little. For 2 years Tara had your undivided attention. Spare some time each week to do the same for Jenny, so her little soul can heal from this ordeal.", "You all need family counseling, starting with you and your daughter Jenny.", "YTA, the dinner was for you and Jenny not a girls night out. Where at all in the invite was it mentioned you, Tara and Jennifer?", "Jenny sees that Tara was the reason she was sent off to another city, away from her friends and everything she knows and she was probably hoping that the alone time she missed would be made up now she\u2019s back\n\nShe sees you as biased to Tara, I don\u2019t have the information to know if she is right or wrong in that \n\nYTA I\u2019m afraid, it\u2019s a soft one as I think your heart is in the right place", "Jesus you are dense! You abandoned your child for 2 years and couldn\u2019t even find a few hours a month to spend with her! You only saw her a few time a YEAR?? I\u2019m sorry you had a sick child but you don\u2019t abandon your other one & expect her to be okay!! And now you still refuse to spend one on one time with her?? Do better! You don\u2019t get to to have a girls night you need to repair the relationship with your daughter that you actions destroyed. Yeah I\u2019m sure it was a difficult time for you but you didn\u2019t even TRY.", "YTA and your additional comments reinforce that judgement. \n\nYou don\u2019t sound like you actually want anything to do with Jenny. You came here for advice and in every reply you double down on how you feel and how awful Jenny treats Tara and how hard it is for Tara. \n\nDo you even care about Jenny or are you just trying to repair the relationship because you don\u2019t like how she\u2019s treating Tara?", "So Jenny practically made a big neon sign saying \"MOM, SHOW ME YOU LOVE ME AND SPEND TIME WITH ME\", and you still pretend you don't know why she is upset with you?  YTA", ">Last night her dad managed to convince her to go out to dinner with me\n\nHow lovely mother daughter bonding time\n\n>Tara and I got ready\n\nNevermind then\n\nIt doesn't matter that she was sick, fact of the matter is to your younger daughter she was sent off and your older daughter got all of her parents' love attention devotion and time \n\nNow that she's back, rather than making up for the quality time you both could have spent together, you are trying to throw both your daughters together and act like the past is in the past \n\nYour younger daughter needs her parents love and undivided attention also\n\nYTA\n\nAlso if you were truly paying attention to your daughter you wouldn't be here. She's clearly saying she needs you, her mother, to want to have a relationship with her and spend time with her. Not treat her as a visiting friend\n\nEdit to correct daughters", "YTA! Your daughter missed her family, that she did not get to see for 2 years. She also probably had to leave her friends 2 times now. In that time your focus was 90% of the time on your sick child, which is understandable. Your husband probably spent his time mostly 70-80 % at work and the rest with Tara. In one of your comments you said thefe were only calls bc of tge cost, also understandable, even if it is sad.\n  \nNow i would like to know:\n  \nDid you put in any effort to spend time with Jenny, even if it is only over calls? Where there also video calls?\nBc i talk with my mom almost daily over the phone, even if it's just for 5 minutes, to talk about how our day was, what we did, if there was any trouble etc. and we live like only 15 minutes apart, i get to see her every week!\n \nAlso did your husband spend alone-time with Jenny already? Did they maybe call more often in those 2 years?\n   \nI think what you should do is spend quality time with Jenny! I know you want your daughters to get along, but Jenny most likely feels neglected. Right now she thinks bad of her sister bc she thinks she stole her parents, especially you, away. Even if she most likely somewhere in her heart knows her sister could not do anything about it, she needed a villain.\nFor now you should maybe go out alone with Jenny, do something she enjoys, hell maybe, if you can afford it, go on a trip for 1 or 2 days alone with her.\nHere i mean only you, the mom, and Jenny, while ylu husband can watch after Tara, bc right now it looks like he and Jenny are already on better terms!\nAfter you went on a few outings, even if it's just grocery shopping, you can try and slowly include Tara ^^", "Your daughter needs some therapy.  She is harboring some major feelings and emotions about being abandoned.  She probably feels that you \"chose\" your other daughter over her.  She would probably enjoy some one on one time with you to help reconnect.  Spend some time with her and talk with her.  You already knew there were issues so I'm not sure why you invited Tara to go along too, but your daughter feels pushed aside and unimportant.  \nI'm not saying that all of this is really true...but her feelings are her feelings.", "YTA\n\nYou were in an impossible situation for a few years, during which you had to prioritize Tara. \n\nIf you couldn't visit for those 2 years (as you've said in the comments), she will definitely be feeling abandoned, because she was. Calling simply is not a substitute for parenting. Talk to her, and without being defensive, acknowledge that you weren't there for her. Do not bring Tara into it, because at the end of the day, you were the adult responsible for the relationship.\n\nYou mentioned that your husband isn't subject to Jenny's behaviour because he buys her things. While I don't think buying someone's affection is a great idea, here it's showing Jenny that she at least *matters* to her father. He's doing something, even if that something isn't the best idea. \n\nYou're saying that Jenny won't work with you, but she shouldn't have to--she is the child, traumatized by the abandonment of her parents. It is up to you to rebuild that bridge. She may see fit to meet you halfway at some point, but you are a long way from that.\n\nAs far as this specific episode goes, it seems that you're determined to go back to normal now that the crisis with Tara has passed, but the truth of the matter is that the normal in your mind no longer exists. Jenny isn't the same person anymore, just as this whole situation has changed everyone in your family. \n\nYou're trying to heal you family as a whole, but need to keep in mind that that can only be accomplished by working on the individual relationships. Right now focus on *your* relationship with Jenny, which means *a lot* of 1:1 time. Every now and then do something with the whole family, but Jenny should not feel like she is less of a priority than her sister. You have a lot of time to make up for.\n\nAnd you need to realize that Jenny and Tara's relationship may never recover from this. Don't force it, or it will come at the expense of your relationship with Jenny,\n\nAll you can do now is make sure that Jenny knows that she is loved.", "YTA, try listening to her and hangout with her just you two. Give her that time she clearly also needs one on one .inviting her sister will make it worse . She will warm back up to her sis eventually if you actively listen and not just do what u think is better.", "YTA. You need to listen to your daughter. She spent two years feeling like you didn't care about her at all. I get that your other daughter was sick. Nothing changes that. But you absolutely need to talk to her, get her into therapy, and focus on spending one-on-one time with her. My heart breaks for this poor girl. She didn't ask for her sister to be sick, either. And, unlike you, she was a child when this all happened. She deserves to feel as though her mother cares about her.", "She needs 1 on 1 or 2 on 1 and a whole lot of rebuilding based on being seen as her own person. And she blames Tara for causing it and you for sending her away.\n\nYou put her out of sight to make your life easier. You shouldn\u2019t have done that.\n\nThere was another one of these a couple of months ago from a young man who was shipped off for the same reason but much younger. The sibling died 15 years later and suddenly the parents remembered their other child and ludicrously thought that they should get a free pass for their abandonment and were shocked to discover that their child hated them. \n\nYou\u2019ve a lot of work ahead of you.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Since your daughter came back home, have you ever spent anytime with her alone? Op your daughter said what is paining her, so please do better. You sent her away and yes she may understand but you could have sought to spend some time with her apart from your sickly daughter. Even from the way your post reads, you see the sick daughter and yourself as a team against your husband and daughter.", "YTA you REALLY need to make some time and build some bridges with Jenny. She is only 14.", "My soft YTA judgement turned to just a YTA judgement based on your replies. Please, for the sake of both your daughters, read and digest and reflect on what people are saying here. \n\nYou need to spend 1-1 time with Jenny. Ask her questions about how she\u2019s feeling. Understand what her experience was like while she was apart from the rest of her family. You need to give the girls space to get to know each other again. You all individually need therapy.", "Jenny thought she was going to dinner with just you. She's tired of being second fiddle to Tara. You need to prioritize Jenny now and try to spend time just with her and make up for SENDING HER AWAY!  You all need family therapy also. YTA", "YTA. Your daughter needs a mother. If you don\u2019t want to do that, find someone who will on a permanent basis.\n\nETA: for anyone else here wondering, it\u2019s not a great idea to rehome a child like a dog.", "YTA you\u2019ve spent years putting Tara before Jenny for everything. Jenny wants to spend time with **YOU** not her sister. in her mind her sister is the reason she was sent away to live with her grandparents, she needs a therapist and one on one time with not just your husband but *you*. she has a lot of very understandable resentment for her sister (which is definitely your fault, having a sick child does not mean that you get to only focus on that child and forget about everything else).", "YTA \n\nTara was sick, and I understand why you made the decisions that you did, but to Jenny, you abandoned her in favor of her sister. She is a child and so even though she might understand why things happened the way they did, she is still entitled to her feelings about it, and has no control over feeling that way. For 2 years you devoted your life to one daughter and the other was pushed aside. Again, I understand the circumstances, but this is how Jenny sees things. And since she\u2019s been home it seems like you have made no effort to make her feel special again. And by inviting Tara you once again made her feel less important. \n\nYou need family therapy and Jenny probably needs individual therapy. Fix this or you truly will only have one daughter once Jenny turns 18 and cuts contact with you completely.", " YTA\n\n\nEverybody reading this can see that you care more for tara and do put her first every time- even when it is completly unnessary. \n\n\n\nMost parents try to make up if they have to focus soely on one child- with attention and ressources-. You do the opposide. You weridly seem to try and do the opposide. \n\n\n\nJenny told you why she does not spend time with you. You saying \"that is not true\" or acting like \"she does not tell me why\" doesn't make your words true.\n\n\nSpend one on one time with Jenny! It is not that hard.", "YTA. Every life is not \"normal\". You removed Jenny from her home and friends. For two years when she was 12. If she was 2 this would make sense, but not 12. It's understandable she resents both you and Tara. Did you actually discuss this move with her? Did she agree with it?", "YTA. Jenny did not have a mother for 2 years. I understand that Tara was sick, and that as a mom you needed to be there for her, BUT that doesn't make Jenny need you any less. She deserved an evening with her mom. Of course she resents all of you. That's only to be expected. Did you really think she would just come back all smiles and be grateful she's in the family again?", "YTA\n\nYou abandoned your daughter for two years.\n\nI wonder why she might want some alone time with you.", "She\u2019s 15, and feels abandoned by you / insecure in your love. Don\u2019t even bother with that rational shit of my other daughter was sick. Emotions don\u2019t deal in facts, especially at 15. Your younger daughter is secure in her relationship with you. The older one is not, and needs one on one time with you and most likely individual therapy, along with family therapy. Otherwise your family is just going to be minus your older daughter in the long run. \nI don\u2019t want to say yta because this isn\u2019t about that, this is much more complex", "YTA she NEEDS to spend time with her mother alone. Listen to your child! Two years you spent with you other daughter alone and neglecting her. Just spend time with her alone.", "Yta why can\u2019t you have some time alone with Jenny? Tara got you for 2 years, now it\u2019s time to reconnect with Jenny, it\u2019s time for her to be priority, if you want the girls to be friends, then plan dates with only Jenny, and girls day with both of them, but you can\u2019t include Tara in everything because Jenny for 2 years wasn\u2019t included", "Gentle YTA on this one. Tara's illness dominated everything to the point that you had to send your daughter away. To you that was practical but have you ever considered that Jenny felt abandoned? For years it felt like you were consistently choosing her sister over her. How often did you go visit Jenny while her sister was ill? How often did you call? Did Jenny cease to be any sort of presence/priority in your life it was all of your time, focus, attention, energy, spent on Tara? \n\nReally think about what you're asking Jenny to do here. She's finally got her mom back and once again, she has to sacrifice some one on one time with her Mom by having the sister mom really loves tag along. Your daughters will most likely need more time and a therapist to repair their relationship. In fact, you and your daughter will likely need a therapist as well. \n\nYou weren't wrong for being there for Tara, just to be clear, but what about Jenny? Who was there for her?\n\nEDIT: Firm YTA. You didn't go see your daughter once in two years. Not one time. You literally phoned it in. I'm sure having a sick child was stressful, but you completely abandoned your other child. The fact that you seem to be taking zero responsibility for the role you played in the demise of your relationship with your daughter is very telling. Jenny is a CHILD. It is YOUR responsibility to make the bigger effort here.", "YTA one on one time is definitely needed. Even us strangers see this. You'd think being close up and in your face you'd notice it more.", "YTA. Just because one child is gravely ill, the other doesn\u2019t cease to exist and need the love and attention of her parents. Jenny is counting the days until she goes away to college or escapes you at 18. You abandoned her for Tara.", "INFO: did Jenny understand why you were sending her away? Was this something you communicated to her or you and your husband? Did you routinely check in on Jenny and spend any time with her while she was at your MIL\u2019s?

At that age, they\u2019re learning how to process their emotions differently than they did as children because they understand a lot more. She\u2019s only 14. At first glance it\u2019s sounds like you just shipped her off and forgot about her for 2 years. And while I know you weren\u2019t exactly home everyday, on the couch watching housewives, that\u2019s still 2 very formidable and crucial years that you missed out on.

Just spend time with her- alone. And start counselling, both individually and as a family, and maybe even as a mother daughter duo. Once you begin to fix your relationship with her than you can approach her about restarting her relationship with her sister, especially if you take all blame for her neglect and tell her the whole truth about how sick her sister was and that it wasn\u2019t her fault but your own. \nYes your husband may seem to be buying her affection which isn\u2019t good, but I\u2019m sure he is also trying to make up for two years which he will never actually be able to do.

Obviously we all understand why you felt it was the best thing for her compared to the alternatives, but you need to be able to acknowledge that even so it was likely a really awful time for her. She\u2019s lost a lot of time with you all in some really formative years and I\u2019m sure she worries about being \u201cabandoned\u201d again if any other family crisis occurred. \n\nShe needs you to really listen to her about her experiences and not try to explain how they could have been worse. She likely would benefit from therapy. And she needs time with you, her parent, without feeling like that time is going to be parcelled off to Tara. Spend time with her 1 on 1, show her she absolutely matters to you, and you will probably find that it helps her relationship with Tara too.", "I'm a bit puzzled: You know what the problem is. You know how to solve it. So why aren't you doing that instead of posting on reddit?

She needs to be assured that she's a priority for you guys too. And while you may not be coming from a malicious intention in sending her away to give her a less tumultuous life with hospital visits, she may have felt abandoned. Plan for 1:1 dates with her. Also have the girls spend some 1:1 time doing some fun activity so that they build a bond with each other, and Jenny starts empathizing with the illness her sister went through. It'll be awkward initially, but you need to be patient and giver her space and time. Also, I see that both your girls are in their teens - never known to be an easy phase in any household. So, all one can say is, don't be too harsh on them or on yourself", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you're looking at this only from a high level rational point of view and not a base emotional point of view.

She probably feels like you discarded her when it wasn't convenient for you.\n\nI know that isn't true and you were just trying to do your best.

You should apologise, but also show your apology through actions.\nDemonstrate your love for her through your actions and show her that she is wanted and loved.\nYou should also talk with her about how she feels. It's interesting that you haven't done this and instead immediately came to Reddit. Why not ask her how she feels?\nThis might mean you will need to accept a rebuke from her and admit how it looked. You need to accept this rebuke otherwise she might never trust you again.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to choose one child over the other with no consequences\u2026and this is the consequence.

If you need a babysitter for the you her for whatever reason just hit up MIL again.", "YTA. While part of me can see why you sent Jenny away, a larger part of me can see her POV.

While that isn\u2019t cool either, you only seem to recognize him favoring one daughter over the other now and not that the two of you have done that for two years to her.\n\nBest thing you can do as a mom, if you\u2019re determined to try and fix your relationship with the daughter you abandoned, is to sit her down one on one. No husband, no Tara. Have an honest and heartfelt conversation and admit you were wrong. Try to cautiously explain why you did what you did. Promise it will never happen again and that you would like the two of you to work together to fix things with one another. Schedule a weekly bonding time between just the two of you.

I think you thought that everything would just go back to normal and that she would just understand your motives. But if you never told her, how could she? I believe where you need to start is mending your personal relationship with her and encouraging Tara and Jenny to find their way without your interference. If that means family counseling, then you guys are going to have to do that. You were in a super tough situation, and handled it the best you knew how but still fell short. That\u2019s life, fortunately mistakes can be rectified with sincerity and work. \n\nListen to your daughter and what she needs from you. It looks like she resents Tara and blames her, but it\u2019s really you she resents (sounds harsh, sorry).

I know you may not see it as you having abandoned her but TRUST me based off Jenny's own words, it seems that's how she feels. \n\nI wasn't by any means on the same boat as Jenny, but as a sibling to a severely disabled kid, I know how it feels to become an afterthought in the family because a sibling became priority. You feel worthless, and her behaviour now reflects those feelings, on top of her being a teen, this is completely normal behaviour considering her circumstances.", "YTA.", "YTA.\n\nRolled my eyes so hard I got a headache.", "YTA. \n\nYou sent your daughter away during difficult times and while I can sort of understand the reasoning behind it, I can't imagine how hard it must have been for her, to feel excluded from her family. \n\nOne step I would take is send you daughter to therapy and have one on one time with her. Maybe, with time, your relationship can be mended. It's understandable how she feels and why she feels that way.", "This is above Reddit's post grade love. I can't render a judgement because this beyond internet strangers opinions. Your family went through traumas, y'all need professional help to mend. Every one of you. Jenny is reacting to feeling cast aside and neglected. For whatever reason she's allowing your husband to buy back her love. But that's only temporary and superficial. Y'all need therapy. Individual and family.", "I wont call you TA, because i feel like you did what you thought was best since so much of your time was centered on Tara, but that was 2 years of time Jenny didnt have with you. And i know its not your fault Tara was sick and needed to be hospitalized, but from Jenny's pov, she had to be uprooted for her sisters sake. I know it may not seem like it, but i think its fair that you spend some 1 on 1 time with Jenny. Explain it as best you can to Tara, and maybe see if therapy is something that could help Jenny.", "I dont think you are an AH, at least from what you have said. But looks like Jenny is needing some attention, you just spend 2 years fully dedicated to Tara (for a very valid reason) so now you need to build again the relationship with Jenny.\n\nTry to be compasive and spend time alone with her, none of you had it easy in the last years but she is just a teenager, if you need help you may talk to a psy for doing family therapy.\n\nEdit:\nIf for 2 years you didnt visit Jenny yes YTA, by wanting to take care of one of your daughters you lose the other one", "YTA you didn't visit her in those two yrs according to your comments. Your angry she is more for her dad because he's putting her before her sister after you both abandoned her for 2 yrs. You want her involved with your golden child but she has told you how she feels. She wants YOU on your own NOT with her sister but you won't do that because you want tara to feel included. You have all shown she was an after thought for 2yrs. She feels abandoned ffs you know how she feels she's telling you. \n\nKeep putting tara first and you will lose jenny if you haven't already. \n\nEach comment you make is all about tara do you even like the child you abandoned for 2yrs with her grandmother. Who you couldn't be bothered to visit.", "Yta", "YTA\nBut now you know and nows the time to fix things before it gets out of hand..\nI've read enough reddit to see what the potential ending will be", "Yta and a shitty mother. You send your daughter away and in those 2 years never visited her?!  y\u2019all need some counseling and sounds like you can benefit from some one on one", "YTA. This is how glass children are born and raised.", "YTA\n\nI was going to give you a soft YTA but then I read your responses and the fact that it was up to Jenny to have come visit for two years but you never went to see her doesn\u2019t sit well with me. From your comments, you\u2019re more worried about how Jenny is making you and Tara feel rather than being her mother and thinking about the way you made her feel. Separate your own feelings-this isn\u2019t about you. You have a child that feels that you abandoned her for her sibling and you keep trying to push a relationship between all of you, when that obviously isn\u2019t what she wants right now. Your entire family needs therapy and you all need to think about Jenny for once.", "YTA OP. Jenny agreed to go to dinner with what she thought was just you then you threw Tara in her face last minute. You neglected Jenny\u2019s need for a mother for two years to take care of Tara, you foisted her off on a grandparent \u201cfor her own good\u201d, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you did enough to keep up your relationship with her. Your husband recognized quickly that when Jenny moved back he needed to make up the last two years to her. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019d had more contact with her during the two years than you since she was willing to let him try and fix things. Then here you are, not worried so much about your relationship with Jenny but about the fact your daughters don\u2019t spend time together. Of course Jenny resents Tara even if she knows on an intellectual level she needed more of your attention while sick. But she\u2019ll also see all the times where you guys as parents could have made time for her or should have made time for her and didn\u2019t. You need to fix the relationship between you and your daughter before there is any chance of them fixing their sibling relationship. You need to show Tara that you can put her needs/ wants above Jenny\u2019s some times. And most importantly you all need to get in family therapy. Right now you\u2019re on track for losing your youngest once she can be financially independent. It would be really bad for you to pay for Tara\u2019s car/college/anything and not do the same for Jenny so before you do something for Tara make sure you\u2019ll be able to do it for Jenny even if your circumstances changes.", "YTA.  Listen to yourself.  You are not the victim here.  You have the opportunity to try to fix things with Jenny.  Y\u2019all need family therapy and individual therapy.", "YTA, and your relationship with your daughter went one more step towards permanently dead and broken. \n\nHer sister got 120% of her parents love for two full years. Sent to live with grandma. Feeling dumped because 'she's healthy, she doesn't need us. her sister is FAR more important'. (Remember, this is a young teenager's POV here) It sounds like you didn't even ask Jenny what she wanted. Just the stereotypical jerk parents: \"I AM 200% I KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR MY KIDS! I DON'T NEED TO ASK THEM! THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WANT. I AM SUPERIOR. I AM INTELLIGENT. I, AM A PARENT.\" \n\nYou have YEARS of groveling to make up for this. \n\nAnd make NO MISTAKE here. She WILL remember this in perpetuity.", "YTA Jenny is literally screaming for your attention. It\u2019s obviously not Tara\u2019s fault she was sick, but I imagine Jenny feels abandoned regardless. Please make some time for just you and Jenny.", "YTA. You neglected Jenny for 2 years and can\u2019t even give her any undivided attention. You are your husband are terrible parents. That\u2019s not how you treat your children, especially during rough times. You\u2019re suffering the consequences like you should. Don\u2019t be surprised at 18 she cuts you off.", "YTA she wants to only spend time with you. Stop forcing her to spend time with Tara, its no ones fault but you sent her away. She lost her mother and father for two years. She resents Tara for it. She doesnt want to share - even though Tara was ill and having the worst time in hospitals, Jenny didnt have you and now she wants your undivided attention. You owe her this.\n\nYou have to first rebuild your relationship with Jenny. Only then once its established should you add Tara to the mix. It might be that she cant get over what happened and then you start going to therapy as a family.", "YTA\n\nCircumstances don't justify favoritism.", "I read through your comments and I am stunned how much you are missing the point.\n\nStop trying to pin crap on your husband. Stop trying to play the victim. While I am sorry Tara went through Hell, Jenny was abandoned by her parents. You don't think that but she does.\n\nShe sees herself getting thrown away by her parents. Parents who love Tara more than her. It might not be true but that is what she sees. You need to work on that before you can do anything else.\n\nYou need to create a Bond with her first because right now she thinks you love Tara more. You need to prove you don't before she can love Tara.\n\nYTA", "YTA. At this point, your family dynamics are on course for a major collision - in fact, it's already begun.\n\nJenny was convinced to go out to dinner with *you*. But it wasn't you, it was you and Tara. Jenny is crying out for time with her mother, and you can't afford her that, because you want them to bond and get along. You trying to force it isn't going to make it happen. You basically ditched her for her sister, and continue to to not focus on her, but rather, them both. Even had both girls been healthy throughout - each child *deserves and requires* one on one time with their parent(s). You aren't providing that.  \n\nYou need family counseling at a minimum. You are trying to play the victim when you aren't. Dad is trying to play Santa Claus to alleviate his guilt. Jenny is resentful that she's been shunned. Tara, although having been ill, is still in the same position - getting what seems to be more attention than Jenny. This situation is a time bomb.", "Yta\n\n\nSo when times are rough, you just threw your healthy daughter away, and now that she's back you wonder why she's not close to her sister and you? You failed her as a parent. It's super clear that she just wanted to try just dinner with you, but nope. You had to bring along someone who, right now, she blames on being sent away. Yes, family therapy is NEEDED, but you need to do your part. Seriously.", "YTA. You threw her away. What did you expect?", "YTA because for 2 years you gave all your attention to one daughter. The other one was \u201cshipped away\u201d. I know this was probably for the best, but this is not something that a normal child has to go through. I would focus on spending alone time with Jenny going forward. She needs to feel loved not just in words, but in action.", "YTA. Your daughter has been forced to live out-of-home for two years. It sucks that your other daughter got very sick, but the way you handled that was atrocious. You essentially told Jenny she's too much to handle right now, so you pawned her off to some family for a couple of years.  \n  \nAnd now that she's back home, she gets treated to Tara favoritism.  \n  \nThis may not be your intent, or how you see what has happened, but you're looking at it with the calmness and knowledge of an adult. Not the absolute wreck that is a 14 year old's inexperienced teenage brain.  \n  \nGive Jenny some alone time, let her know her mother is there for her, and she was not abandoned in favor of the other daughter.", "YTA.  Now, since you obviously only give a fig about Tara - if you want Tara to have a sister, and a relationship with Jenny, you need to stop neglecting your younger daughter.  You need to remediate some of the resentment that is a result of your own actions of excluding Jenny and failing to meet her needs.  Forcing Jenny to \"bond\" with Tara will only breed more resentment, and is counterproductive to your goals of nurturing your favorite daughter.\n\nThank goodness Jenny's got her father.", "YTA. You gave your daughter up for TWO years to take care of your other daughter and you don't see that you need to reconcile and bond with her. You gave her away for TWO years but you can't even go to dinner without the other? Your husband had talked your daughter into giving you another chance and you completely blew it!", "YTA - You asked to have dinner with YOU.... not you and her sister who you displaced your daughter for. You need to work on the relationship with your estranged daughter.... JUST you. The fact that you threw in her sister was really out of touch.", "YTA. Froggoten child syndrome.  have seen it happen within my extended family.  Your reasoning is absolutely irrelevant.  You  compounded it by trying to bring the other child  out with you after your husband finally convinced her to go out with you. Unfortunately, you are still in that mind set.  Immediate therapy is required NOW  but i have little hope because you have justified and rationslized  your actions and behavior. This is not going to end well..", "YTA. Unfortunate situation regarding Tara but sorry YTA. Best thing for who? Jenny or you? Be honest with yourself. You sent your 12 year old to live IN ANOTHER CITY with her grandmother. 12 year old girls need their mothers and they need their friends. YOU took away both. Did you call her every single bloody day and be texting each other day and night. Somehow I doubt it. Did she even ever come to visit during that time? How much time did you set aside from Jenny. Do you know how her life was actually life with her grandmother? Standard case of the curse of the able bodied child. \n\nShe blames you for abandoning her and Tara for being the reason why. She knows gun to your head she isn't the priority in your life. Why your husband has escaped her wrath is anyones guess. If you want to fix this then its going to be a bloody long road but you need to actually start spending some 1 on 1 time with Jenny.", "YTA\n\nI agree with the comments saying Jenny needs therapy.  But more importantly OP needs therapy as she doesn't see anything wrong with how she is handling things.\n\nHow did dad respond to what happened?  Had he suggested that you take Jenny out to supper or that you take both daughters?\n\nYou have a lot of work to do if you actually want a relationship with Jenny.  Good luck.", "YTA, and you can fix it\n\nThere are many, many supports available for families with sick children. If you\u2019re in the US, you had access to a child life specialist, case manager, social worker, and family therapist. \n\nAll of these professionals would have been focused on helping to make sure that your family had the support and resources you needed during such a long hospitalization. \n\nThey also have specific sibling support in children\u2019s hospitals because of this very concern, where siblings feel ignored while their parents focus all attention on the patient. \n\nI\u2019m intimately familiar with these resources as a parent and a professional. \n\nParenting all of our children and maintaining the cohesion of our families remains our job no matter the circumstances. \n\nRelatives and friends can come to our homes to help. Schedules for shifts at the hospital can be made. \n\nWhen there is a conflict or rupture with one of our children, the onus is on us to repair it. Always. This is how we guide and teach and parent our children. \n\nShow your daughter that people make mistakes, even with good intentions. Demonstrate how to humble yourself to admit you were wrong, listen to her pain and ask for her forgiveness. Embody what it means to repair and strengthen a loving, healthy relationship. \n\nFamily therapy is a wonderful idea.\n\nEdit: missing word", "OPs comments turn her from a soft YTA mum who has good intentions into a complete dumpster fire of a parent lol.\n\nShe is clearly far too narcissistic to realise how big a tool she is. Glad Tara is doing better though and hopefully Jenny can learn that it wasn't Tara's fault and they can have a good relationship.", "Family therapy, immediately.  You may have done what you thought was best but there is fall out and you have to stop ignoring it.  From Jenny's perspective, you sent her away to focus 100% on Tara.  Now she wants to see if you're willing to focus 100% on her.  Wake up. YTA", "YTA - First, I am so sorry your entire family had to go through such a harrowing time.  You have ALL been traumatised and all have so much healing to do, individually and as a family.\n\nBut yes, in this instance, YTA for including both daughters.  You removed your youngest from your family to focus on your eldest.  I understand why you did it but, from Jenny's perspective, she had a family, then there was the hell of finding out Tara was ill, I am guessing several months of hospital visits before she was sent away and, likely the most traumatising, then effectively ignored by her parents for 2 years.   I grew up with a severely ill father, and spent months of my teen years waiting in hospitals. There's time.  If anything, there's too much time. You could have spent 10 minutes on the phone every night to wish her good night. You could have taken it in turns to visit her on your time off. But no, every single waking second had to be spent obsessing over Tara.\n\nShe has spent 2 years without parents, who didn't even visit her.  I am guessing when she came back she had hoped that she would go back into the loving family you had been before Tara got ill.  Except you have been a family - a family of 3, with all your attention focused on one daughter.  And after two years of every waking moment being focused on tara, and likely barely even thinking about Jenny, I am not surprised OP that you are struggling to adjust to having 2 daughters again. But you have two daughters, one of which you have barely seen in 2 years.\n\nIt's not up to Jenny to work to rebuild her relationship with you.  You are the adult, the parent and you are the one who abandoned her.  You need to make time for BOTH of your daughters individually.  Your world, and your family, doesn't only revolve around Tara anymore.\n\nETA - Jeez I've just seen OPs edit.  TARA IS NOT BEING NEGLECTED IF YOU GO OUT FOR DINNER WITH JENNY FFS OR BECAUSE JENNY GETS A LIFT INSTEAD OF HER.  She is not trying to make sure Tara is neglected.  She is desperately looking for proof her parents ACTUALLY WANT HER and aren't going to send her away to focus on Tara. You know how she can quantify that, in her little 14 year old brain? MUM, DAD PLEASE FOR ONCE SHOW ME YOU'LL PUT ME ABOVE TARA.  Tara not being put first at every single moment isn't the same as Tara being neglected.\n\nYOU HAVE ALL BEEN TO HELL AND BACK.

For 2 years I had to be in the hospital all the time and my husband had to work 2 jobs to be able to pay for the hospital\n\nWe decided that the best thing to do for Jenny would be to send her to live with my MIL who lives in another city. She is the only close family we have. We were trying to give Jenny a normal life otherwise she would spend all her time in a hospital like us.\n\nNow that Tara is better, things are a lot better and we asked Jenny to come back home and she was glad to do so however she only ever spends time with her dad, never with me or Tara and she never says why she doesn't want to spend time with us. Not just that she also actively bullies Tara any chance she gets\n\nLast night her dad managed to convince her to go out to dinner with me. Tara and I got ready and we were waiting for Jenny. She came out of her room and saw us there, turned to my husband and said she changed her mind and went back to her room. I followed her and asked what's wrong. She started screaming at me asking me if I have to include Tara in everything. She accused me of not enjoying spending my time with her and \"bringing Tara so that I could spend time with Tara and pretend to like Jenny\" I told her this is not true and I was just trying to have a girls night with both of my daughters but she screamed at me to get out and called me an asshole and other names\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nothing you do right now will fix it. \n\nUntil then focus on having a good relationship with each of your teenagers separately. Regular one on one time. If you can swing it, twice as much time with Jenny as Tara. Let Tara bond with her dad again. Focus on the positive with Jenny. You need something like 3 positive comments to offset one negative. You\u2019ve got a lot of positives to focus on.\n\nRecognize that time with both your girls is something only you value. You can ask for it, but clearly ask for it and treat it as the gift it is.", "YTA. Life is hard sometimes. Tara got dealt a bad hand and you had to deal with that, but you have two daughters. You needed to handle it as a family of 4, not a trio of 3. I can see how your heart was probably in the right place sending Jenny away, but you have some work to do now. Listen to her, she is very clearly telling you that she feels pushed to the wayside. You can still make things right again, but it\u2019s gonna take some time. Seek family and individual therapy for everyone.", "YTA you have mishandled the situation. I\u2019m sorry your husband is getting off right now as this is both your responsibility. Your daughter feels abandoned and clearly feels like your choosing her sick sister. You need to put the work into your relationship with Jenny. It sounds like she is upset at the situation and how you are acting. If you work on your relationship I am sure she will lay off Tara. She\u2019s just very envious of your relationship with Tara and doesn\u2019t have the tools to express this so she is reacting with anger.", "Yes YTA. How can you not clearly see how she is feeling. She was abandoned by her family for two whole years. And she\u2019s only young so of course she\u2019s going to be blaming her sister. She blaming her sister from taking her mum away. You dropped the ball. You need to stop thinking about equality and understand what equity is. You need to do something to show you love her as much as your other daughter and spend some time with her to rebuild that relationship. 1:1. Not only that, maybe you need to look into therapy for her so she doesn\u2019t end up with serious abandonment issues and insecure attachments when she grows up.", "A very soft YTA. I've learned that children need individual parent 1:1 time that doesn't include their siblings semi regularly (having raised 4 children myself). Jenny feels passed over and neglected. Did you all explain to her that you were trying to give her a normal life while her sister was sick? Was it explained to her it was a temporary situation because you didn't want to burden her with being at the hospital all the time? Either way, I am really not for children cursing/being ultra disrespectful (yes, they're allowed to be angry but not at the expense of using profanity etc.) at their parents, I think the sisters need to learn how to be sisters again. Seems like Jenny needs lessons in compassion as well as being understood while not being able to clearly articulate her feelings. Tara needs to understand why her sister feels neglected and then try communicating how difficult it was being sick for 2 years. Everyone here needs to learn that none of this was easy on any of you, especially both girls. Good luck to you all and glad you have 2 healthy children. Everyone needs to be heard here.", "YTA. You completely abandon your daughter and you wonder why she's being a dick to you. She needs one on one time with you but she's not getting it. Maybe shes latching more to dad because maybe he's doing a better job connecting than you are.\n\nMaybe the fact that you had to ask a reddit forum whether or not you screwed up or not is a clue to how clueless you are.", "YTA Tara had all your attention for 2 years, while Jenny who is in a age that she really needs her mother sometimes never got to enjoy that. You said you did your best, but you couldn't give up one day a week to be by your other daughter? I'm certain your husband could have helped in the hospital. Now it seems like Jenny is feeling resentful of you because she probably feels like you just gave her away like nothing. It seems like she wants a relationship with you, but some 1 on 1 time instead of you including Tara. In Jenny's mind she's probably like '\"I cant believe my mother was with Tara for 2 years and don't even want to spend some alone time with me\"", "YTA. It was a dinner for you and Jenny, not a girls night for you, Jenny, and Tara. If you really reflect on the situation, it\u2019s clear the issue is not only the time and attention you give to Tara, but that you sent Jenny away to do it. And now Jenny can\u2019t even have 1-on-1 time with you.\n\nI understand your intentions for sending Jenny away, but you have to be open to the reality that Jenny didn\u2019t internalize it that way. No child would.\n\nJenny is doing her best to survive in a situation where she\u2019s uncomfortable and probably feels unwanted. As her mother, you need to listen to her and address her needs without including Tara.", "YTA - light. This is a 14 year old that while rationally speaking went to be with your MIL for all the right reasons may be working through some resentment. You should do something special for her especially knowing she is being cold and distant to the two of you. She is a kid and you are the adult. I get Terra had it rough and I suspect in a different way Jenny had it rough too!", "YTA\n\nWow, just because Tara was going through a tough time doesn\u2019t diminish that fact that Jenny ALSO was going through a tough time. Yes Tara was in the hospital and it was probably a very scary 2 years for you to watch that. However you can\u2019t just ditch the other kids then dis invalidate Jenny\u2019s feelings. She also lost a sister and her parents for 2 years, she was left to deal by herself. \n\nShe knows who\u2019s mommy\u2019s favourite is and she\u2019s not even in the race anymore, she\u2019s not even on mommy\u2019s radar. Daddy in the other hand is making her feel seen, heard and the way she sees Tara being treated by mommy. \n\nIf you do not start therapy for the family and individually PLUS some self reflection then Jenny will go no contact once she\u2019s out of the house. You will be here again on Reddit crying asking why your daughter hates you and you\u2019ll still blame her. \n\nGet your head out of Tara\u2019s ass and show love to Jenny, even sitting at a restaurant with her headphones in. YOU are the parent, YOU have to change and fix it, not her. The child should NEVER be the one to have to fix it.", "YTA.\n\nI'm the older sibling of someone who is chronically ill and has been since we were kids. I don't have much of a relationship with my parents anymore because of it. It was very clear who my mother prioritized. You have the chance to make this better. I suggest you try.", "Yta. And people need to stop sending their kids away because family life might become difficult. All it does is send the message \"when things get hard you're not family\". And I was only sent away for like a day not two god damned years. \n\n12 year olds can have situations explained to them. They can have a say in where they live. They can try to stay with the family with the option to ask you to go to grandma's for breaks or if they want to. Jenny's shot at a typical childhood was gone the second Tara got sick. And instead of having her parents and siblings she was sent away like an inconvenience. \n\nWhen was the last time you acted like Jenny's parent? Not Tara and Jenny's parent. When was the last time you spent time alone with Jenny? When was the last time you had a conversation with Jenny that didn't bring up Tara? \n\nTo Jenny it looks like Tara got you (and your husband) for two years while she was banished. I would bet your husband is trying to rebuild his relationship with Jenny.", "Yea you\u2019re absolutely TA! While you thought you were doing the right thing I suppose, you sent your youngest daughter AWAY while your older one was getting constant attention, even if it was because she was sick. Yes, it\u2019s a horrible situation to be in as a parent but put yourself is Jenny\u2019s shoes for just a second and how she feels that you and your husband discarded her to focus solely on her sister. No, she should absolutely not bully her sister, but she clearly doesn\u2019t know how to handle all the emotions that you\u2019re responsible for. You all need some major family counseling if you want any hopes of mending the relationship with your daughter! I\u2019m actually surprised that she came back \u201chome\u201d to live considering how she must of felt. You also need to try and spend some one on one time with her if she\u2019ll agree. She feels like a second class child to you. Seems she also hold you a bit more responsible than her father too which I\u2019m not sure of why, not enough info here to make a call on that. Jenny sees Tara as the reason why she feels and is treated they was she was. It wasn\u2019t Tara\u2019s fault but a young emotional pre-teen who lost her family for 2 years doesn\u2019t see it that way. Stop trying to force a bind with them. Get Jenny some therapy first and then maybe she\u2019ll come to realize it wasn\u2019t her sister\u2019s fault, but yours and your husband. Please get you kid and your entire family some therapy!", "Has Jenny ever had therapy?  It sounds like she resents both you and Tara for being shunted of to her grandmothers so you could focus all your attention on Tara.  Did you have good intentions?  It sounds like you did, but the effect is the same.  Your daughter seems to feel abandoned and less important to you than Tara.  She wanted alone time with you because your entire focus for 2 years was on Tara.\n\nINFO: how much time did your husband spend with Jenny over those 2 years compared to you?\n\nEDIT: after reading your comments YTA.  Your answers are all about you.  Jenny is a wounded 14 year old who was ejected from her nuclear family for 2 years.  Get over yourself and your martyr complex.  Put your daughter (and family) into therapy.  Make an effort to have just you and her time   It\u2019s going to take time to repair your relationship with her and there will be some push back for a while. Take that time and make that effort if you actually value your relationship with her.", "YTA. The rest is already said by others. You sacrificed one daughter for the other and you do not even see this.", "YTA - the more of your comments I read the more incensed I am on Jenny\u2019s behalf. Do better! Serious counseling is needed here but I doubt you\u2019ll ever get Jenny back. You cut her loose and you don\u2019t care.", "YTA.  You pushed one daughter away for two whole years, and made a couple phone calls. That\u2019s it?  And now you expect her to be completely ok with being abandoned, both physically and emotionally.  Stop being so damned defensive and get this poor child into therapy, to help her work through both the abandonment *and* being blamed for having feelings about it.", "YTA. You have to repair your relationship with Jenny. If your family is not already in therapy I think you all really need it as you've all been through a traumatic experience. Otherwise I see Jenny going no contact with you once she leaves your house.", "I hate to say it but, YTA, it was never said by either of you that she was coming. What Jenny did/ is doing to Tara is horrid, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to force them to bond.", "YTA, for sure\n\nYou sent her away and are choosing Tara over her.\nShe\u2019s going to stop talking to you as soon as she can.\nI never understand why boomers can\u2019t see that their actions are horrible. Also idc what age you are, you\u2019re acting like a selfish boomer.", "yta.\n\njenny is what we call a \u201cglass child\u201d - a sibling of a child who needs constant care. you\u2019re trying to act like nothing happened but something did. you had a child that was sick and because of that, your other child and their needs were pushed aside. in this case, quite literally.\n\nyou need to work on repairing the relationship between you and jenny before she\u2019s going to be comfortable around tara, because in her eyes, tara (and you too, but less) is the reason she didn\u2019t have a consistent family and was uprooted during very (and i can\u2019t stress this enough) VERY important development years.", "YTA but I am not going to be as harsh as some on here. You sent your young daughter to her grandma's because at the time with the other daughters illness you and your husband thought it would be the best way to let her have a normal life while you all dealt with the illness. By the sounds of it your child missed and wanted to come home. You don't say how much you saw or communicated with her while she was gone. You also don't mention if when you did see her all you talked about was Tara. Your child has been away from you for two years and thinks you don't need or want her because her sister is more important. You need to make time for this daughter alone. If I were you I would even plan a weekend get away for you both. Maybe like a makeover weekend. Take her shopping or whatever and talk to her. She is clearly hurting and you need to find out what you can do to reassure her she is important also.", "Man what a fucked up family situation. This is prime example of how not to raise 2 daughters. OP is doubling down on her shitty parenting in the comments", "YTA", "Send Tara to her grandma\u2019s for the summer and have just one on one time with Jenny", "YTA", "You Have Been The Asshole,  but the good news is now that you hopefully see what the problem 5 can start to address it. Immediatly. And I'd recommend that you apologize to her. It goes a long way. Explain your logic with inviting her sister, but tell her if she needs something else from you now, you will give it to her. And ask her what she needs. Sending your entire family all the good energy.", "INFO: did your husband say that the dinner were only for you and Jenny or did he said it was a girl's night? Bc if he said it was just the two of you, then YTA. Jenny went thru hardships without her mother while Tara had you and your husband. You sure need some private talk with her, just you and Jenny, don't even try to mention abt Tara.", "YTA.  \n\n\nMan, this is tough. I was often the sickly kid, and I think my sisters hated that situation where everyone is soft for me and it feels unfair. But it is also why I think YTA. I would have loved to have my siblings support, rather than the special treatment drift us apart. When you're sick, you need all the help you can get and I grew up really distant to my sisters which I did manage to get closer to the other older sister, my oldest sister completely closed herself to me. I know that you didn't want her life to revolve around her sister, and you want what's best for her. But this ain't it. If you want your family to love each other, love each other fairly. I think if she was involved a bit more, she wouldn't bully her sister. I think she feels like Tara took you guys away, and you're punishing Jenny \"the healthy kid\" by sending her away. I get why she prefers the Dad, because he listens to her. If she wants just a dinner with you, then don't impose more than what she asked. Either way, what is done is done. I think you'd be better off talking to a family counselor of sorts of what's the next best way to deal with this situation as this definitely hurt Jenny. I do wish you well with your family, raising one is not easy, and you're definitely gonna make mistakes. I just hope you have the courage to make it right and apologize.", "The fact that you don\u2019t see how you screwed up and continue doing so is absolutely mind baffling. Another case where a parent shouldn\u2019t be surprised when their kid goes NC with them. YTA.", "YTA\n\nlots of people explained it. And instead of reflecting your actions, you put all the blame on your non existing relationship with Jenny on her and your husband.", "Soft YTA. You and your husband need to get on the same page. If you both disregarded Jenny for 2 years and then he is trying to buy back her love while you insist on including Tara in everything since her return. Try just for a SECOND to think about how Jenny felt in the entire situation.... Jenny's resentment will ruin her relationships with you and Tara.\n\nYou were doing what you needed to for Tara, hence the soft yta, but you neglected Jenny and you and your husband BOTH need to address that as a united front. Consider family therapy if you haven't already.\n\nEdit: Also, do not expect this to get resolved right away. This took years to form this hurt and will take possibly just as much time to resolve... Don't force Jenny to forgive you and actually put in the work to deserve that forgiveness.", "YTA-you made her feel unimportant and not like your child by sending her away and now you don't want to spend time with just her to rebuild a relationship?  No wonder she can't stand being with you. Don't think you are repairing this one.  Tara was sick-get it-you could still have had a relationship with your other child.  Don't think she will have a relationship with Tara either.", "YTA. You need to wake up. Spend some time with Jenny individually or prepare to lose her in 4 years.", "YTA! Yikes! how could you just abandon your daughter for 2 years and think that was okay!? You never once went to visit her!? What an absolutely horrible thing to do to a child, seriously what the hell were you thinking!?

He had cancer and we spent a lot of time in the hospital. He has 3 older siblings and while they did have to spend the night with family or friends a lot during that time, they were still included. We still attended their school functions and when we were home from the hospital they were home as normal as well. Sending her away like that was the wrong thing to do. She now feels abandoned by you and when you were going to take her to eat to try to mend fences you again made jt about her sister.", "I go for YTA, because I belive you meant well, but... Step into Jenny's shoes, and try to feel how she feels it. Not how she sees it or is supposed to see it...feelings can't be controlled that easily.\nSo she was send away for her sister, dad working double for her sister, and mom spending hours and hours with her... Because she was ill, of course. But this created also a very intense bond between you and Tara... And now Tata is better, and... It is still not Jenny's time. Tara is always there, it feels as if the two of you where glued at the hip... She doesn't feel that you missed her, that you want to catch up on mother and daughter bonding, that you want to create a special bond between the two of you. It feels as if Tara stole her mom and isn't giving her back... Those are emotions, not thoughts. But when this is how a kid feels, she will act the way you describe it.", "Jenny is either old enough or soon will be old enough to decide where she wants to live. I hope she goes back to the people who actually wanted her and took care of her. She deserves better than what she got", "You are definitely TA\n\nGrow the fuck up", "Yes, YTA. She clearly expected a dinner with just you and her which is the least you should offer her after the abandonment she suffered. No matter the reasons, that\u2019s what it was for her.

Be better.", "YTA-You really can't figure out why your daughter who was sent away is upset? Could it be that your sick child gets all the attention and going out to dinner with you alone is different than going with you and the sister who gets all the attention?", "YTA. You sent your child away so you could take care of your other child. Don't you think it's time to spend some quality time with the daughter you haven't taken care of in TWO YEARS??", "YTA because you never prioritize Jenny over everyone and everything else. She knows it and resents it. Do you even like Jenny? She obviously doesn\u2019t believe that you do. I feel really badly for that poor girl who believes her own mother doesn\u2019t even like her enough to have a one-on-one dinner with her.", "YTA It is very clear that Tara is your favorite child. In other families where everyone lives together, if the parent has a favorite child, the other children tend to have resentment towards the favorite. Jenny was cast aside for two years, likely during puberty, a time when she\u2019d want her mother. As you can now see, Jenny resents Tara and may likely hate her. Their relationship may never recover. It will not recover if you try to force it. You need to stop showing such blatant favoritism by including Tara in everything.

Phone calls, Jenny visiting you, and information overload about primarily Tara is not how a mother/daughter relationship grows into a strong, solid, and healthy alliance. \n\nYou must now take your head out of medical crisis mode and refocus on connecting with Jenny as the young adult she is.

When he got back on his feet he brought her home but she was no longer the sweet girl he sent away, surely, angry and rebellious. Never really got over it.

This would also explain the bullying.\nTara probably feels no connection to her sister, after spending years without contact.\nYou just seem to resent everyone who doesn\u2019t obsess over you", "OP, from Jenny's point of view you abandoned her for two years, sent her to another city, and are expecting her to accept the fact that she's always going to be second to her sister, who is the reason that you spent two years neglecting her. You need to A) start doing one-on-one time with Jenny and B) get her int therapy like, yesterday. Right now YTA for only consistently providing for one daughter's needs. You can change that by giving Jenny what she needs and not forcing her to be around Tara.", "YTA \n\nJenny missed out on time with you as a result of Tara's illness.\n\nNow jenny needs one on one time with you to reconnect.\n\nWhich part of that are you unable to understand?\n\n(It's not rocket science)\n\nTime for you to step up and be the mother she needs.", "You were forced to make a very difficult decision that broke your family apart, even if it was for the right reasons. There is not going to be a perfect answer on how to put things back together, but be receptive to what your daughters are saying to you, not just what you think they need. Work on bonding with Jenny and learning what she really needs, and then figure out how your girls can have a relationship. Even when there are no dramatic incidents, sisters often don\u2019t get along, so I would just give them time to mature and to try to understand where the other one is coming from. All they need to do right now is be able to respect one another, anything more will take time. NTA, but your next steps could land you with that title.", "Therapy for all and sunder seems in order.", "YTA. Jenny NEEDS AND WANTS one-on-one time with you, her mother. She shouldn't have to share you with her sister all the time. Maybe their dad can take Terra out while you take time to spend with Jenny?", "Yr daughter wants to see you make an effort. You have hurt her deeply. I don't know if she will ever get over how she feels. You need to make it up to her and spend time with her. Get to actually know yr daughter. If you don't try to repair it now you will lose her. She feels betrayed and unloved unwanted. Instead of thinking of yourself think of how this child feels. It's been hard on her as well. She feels like you chose your other daughter. Repair this. Therapy. One on one time. Show her you care. That's all she wants. To know she is loved as well. Do better.", "INFO: have you put either of your daughter's in therapy to help them with these huge life changes they are obviously struggling with?", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. You need family therapy and individual therapy for everyone to deal with what was apparently a life threatening illness. So your oldest almost died and lost her sibling in the process. Your youngest thought her sibling would die and lost both sibling and her parents. You burned yourself out doing nothing but taking care of your daughter in the hospital for 2 years. You said your husband was in a similar situation so I will say the same about his burnout. All of that was massive emotional trauma on multiple levels. So reputable and effective therapists is number one. \n\nFrom your comments though, you\u2019re saying that he is actively dismissing Tara in favor of Jenny and that needs to stop. He needs to make time for both without it involving dismissing the other. Make plans and honor them. \nAs for yourself, don\u2019t include Tara in activities meant to restore your bond with Jenny. You can\u2019t build the family bond until you rebuild the one on one bond with Jenny. It\u2019s going to be a long road, but you still have time. You just have to put in the work.", "NAH.\n\nI read your comments. As a mother myself, I am almost tearing up here. \n\nYou are really struggling here, OP. I see you. \n\nYou have had such a hard time for so long, and you try your best to keep the family together in spite of all that has happened to you. Having a sick child is so hard for a mother. Having to send the other child away must have been awful for you, and you still did it because you focused more on the child's needs than on yourself. On top of all that, your husband had to work very much to finance everything, which made you alone in the hospital with the sick child quite a lot of the time. Unable to share the burden with him. (It was surely hard for him too.)\n\nI believe you are a good mother who truly want what is best for both your children. \n\nI am happy for you that you now can be together again as a family. Do not lose sight of this. You are all alive, you can all live together. This is a good thing.\n\nNow comes the time for mending relationships that have been damaged by the unfortunate events life threw at you.  \n\nThe daughter that got sent away needs you now. She needs her mother first. The relationship between the sisters can wait. \n\nI understand you feel hurt by your daughter's anger towards you, and not towards her father. It feels unfair. And maybe it is. But to us adults, fairness cannot be a part of this. Try to be glad for her, that she has one parent that she feels a little bit better about. It is like when they were little. Often they have a phase where only Daddy is good enough to tuck them in at night. I don't know how many times I felt rejected and grumbling internally \"after all I've done for you... all sleepless nights when Daddy slept and I held you... and this is how you repay me\". But that feeling must stay inside of us. It cannot come out to the child.\n\nI suggest you focus on Jenny now. Start by small bits. Try to get her to talk to you, if just a few minutes a day. Ask about her day, ask about her video games, anything. Then try to get one-on one time with her. Maybe you can drive her somewhere she needs to go? In the car, sometimes it is easier to talk than sitting face to face. She might sulk and sit with her headphones but don't give up. \n\nAfter a few times, maybe stop for an ice cream on the way home? She might not talk much but keep trying. Every little minute you get to spend with her alone is valuable now. And let her understand that you are happy with every time you get to spend with her, that you have missed her, that you want her company. But carefully. Don't hammer it in. Just let her understand it. Full focus on her when she lets you. Stay off your own phone, even if she is on hers. \n\nAfter a while, maybe get her to come for dinner with you? Bribe her if you have to. This is no time for keeping to principles of child-rearing. This is more important. Video games? Candy? Dessert? Clothes shopping? Sure!\n\nStep by step you can make her feel important to you.\n\nOnly after she feels loved and valuable again, can you try to help the sisters regain their relationship. But that comes after.\n\nYou can do this, OP. You are a good mother. You can repair the hurt in your daughter. The hurt is not your fault. It is life. Things happen. But it is your responsibility to reach out to her. She is still young, and was so little when she was sent away. You need to be strong. Still after all these years of hardship you need to be strong like a mother. And you have this strength in you. I know it.", "Yeah. YTA.

It may not have been perfect, hell, it may not have been the right choice, but it happened and all you can do is move forward. \n\nI am the youngest sibling of two older sisters who both required a lot of my parents attention. It sucked. As an adult, I can see that they did their best (and that they did it pretty well, honestly) but as a 13 year old, I was sad. I felt less important than my sisters because my problems weren't life threatening. Again, as an adult I understand, but as a kid I felt like a second thought all the time. It's hard.

I am here now and I want to fix that. I never meant to hurt you, but I understand that I did. I want to make sure that I don't hurt you like again. I want to show you I am sorry and that I love you as much as I love your sister.\" All of that is okay!

Maybe you feel like you did the very best you could to deal with an immensely difficult situation and it\u2019s still not enough. That\u2019s super overwhelming and valid. That said, when we choose to become a parent, it\u2019s our job to look inside ourselves for what our needs are, find a way to take care of them (with the help of other supportive adults in our lives), and check them at the door when it comes to our kids. We have to be able to meet our kids where they are at, hear their needs, approach them with compassion and curiosity, and work to meet them with love and care. The way you describe your child\u2019s behaviour in your post looks as though you are trying to shift blame onto her. A 14 year old. Your child who was uprooted twice. Who lost the love and attention of her parents in formative years. This is traumatic regardless of the reason for it. Her behaviour is a trauma response. She\u2019s bullying Tara bc Tara got all the love and attention from her parents for two years while she was shipped away and abandoned. No matter how valid the reasons, that is damaging as hell, and a child doesn\u2019t know how to process that without help. It shows up in these behaviours she\u2019s displaying.\n\nThe only way to handle this situation is to approach it knowing the above to be true. Knowing that Jenny is the child in this situation, and it\u2019s your job to support her to heal. She doesn\u2019t know how to express and advocate for her needs yet. It\u2019s your job to manage your own and teach her how. Not to criticize how she\u2019s handling this. Please seek some professional support with navigating this.

Unfortunately, I did MY best with the tools I had available. I cannot express this to my now 16yr old because it means nothing to her - and rightfully so. What she needs to know is mom screwed up, mom loves her unconditionally, mom wants to make it better. \nYour daughter needs to know 1. You love her as much and unconditionally. 2. You screwed up 3. Your relationship with her a priority.\nI say \u201cyou screwed up\u201d because she is hurt and it\u2019s because of your actions. That does not mean you could have done things differently. Every decision has a consequence and this is the consequence of deciding the physical health of one is priority to the emotional health of the other. You did what most loving mothers would have done - first we keep them alive and physically healthy, emotional health is secondary. You are dealing with the fallout that many loving mothers have to address. \nFrom there you make a point to show her how she is important and how the relationship between you two is important to YOU. \nUse your words and actions and put a little extra focus on Jenny. It will get better. If you do this then when she is much older she will understand why you did what you did and will grant you grace. Otherwise the resentment between you two and between sisters will grow.\n\nThis has given me a little insight and I\u2019m going to go text my baby.", "Around 2 years according to OP. With no visits from mum, but they called. And Jenny came to them.", "According to a comment from OP,she was there for 2 years with no visits at all, only phone calls.", "From OP comment: two years and they didn't visit her.", "Sounds like the majority of the 2 yrs", "She said 2 years with only 5 visits.", "Alllll of this. Building the rapport again is going to take time. OP needs to be patient and invest the time into her daughter.", "It\u2019s even worse, because just when Jenny was finally settling down in her new situation and probably making friends, they uprooted her again.", "I couldn't have said it better myself. \n\nI would also like to add that right now, all Jenny can see is that *her mom doesn't want her*. To her, you sent her away without a second thought when your favourite daughter was sick, and you only deigned to allow Jenny back into your life when it was convenient for you. I'm not saying that's your actual thought process, but it's definitely what she's seeing and how she's feeling. \n\nI grew up feeling discarded and unwanted by my mom just like Jenny is feeling now. My mom got a new family and suddenly I was disposable and worthless. It's too late for my mother and I to make amends now, but it isn't too late for you and Jenny. I highly recommend doing some individual and family therapy so that you, Jenny, and the rest of your family can express how they're feeling and what they're thinking in a pressure-free, moderated environment.", "Yeah. You sent a kid away. Wth. That's not cool. She is never going to get over that.", "Yes to everything except that Tara needs to work to rebuild the relationship. We have no evidence that she did anything wrong here, she didn't ask for OP to drop Jenny and cater to only her. She's probably also going through a really emotionally vulnerable time right now.\n\nShe's also a child, one who is seeing her sister hold a ton of resentment for her through no fault of her own. While Jenny is not really to be blamed, this is all on OP, I wouldn't force Tara to go running after Jenny to... what? Apologize for something she didn't do and had no control over? Just so Jenny can lash out at Tara and make her feel guilty?\n\nAgain, this is NOT on Jenny, she is right to have her feelings. But it is not right to make Tara bear the brunt of those feelings. OP needs to step up. There's no need to force Tara to build a relationship with Jenny right now when both of them are so vulnerable, and that burden should not be on Tara.", "\ud83c\udfc5 \ud83e\udd48 \ud83c\udf96 \n\nHere is my poor man's reward. You articulated everything I wanted to say", ">the other was sent away without a thought.\n\nI have to disagree specifically with this part. They did have to think about it - and I don't think if she had stayed it would've been any better. She still would've felt alone and abandoned due to her sister being sick, but staying at home would've meant she was at the hospital all the time.\n\nI think this is a lose-lose situation with the only win being that Tara is still with her family.\n\nETA: A lot of people are responding like I've passed judgement on OP. I have not. I did not say OP was in the right for sending her daughter away, nor did I say OP was in the right for not spending 1 on 1 time with Jenny. I am simply disagreeing with the parent comment of this thread on one specific point they made.", "Agree with everything you said except the Tara needs to work on rebuilding her relationship with her sister. Tara has done absolutely nothing wrong", "You say it like it was all me. My husband did it too. But she is fine with him. I'm the only one to blame right? I mean of course she is not going to blame her dad when all he does is buy her whatever she wants and do whatever she says but whatever I do is wrong", "Children are just like pets though, right? Rehome them when you don't have time and take them back when you do. You wouldn't want to visit them in person either, that will just make them miss you more. /s", "Can confirm, and I was allowed to remain in the family home. YTA op if for nothing else than not understanding your daughter's position in all of this. You had to focus on your sick kid, yes, that was important, but you didn't have to shove the other away like an inconvenient pet. She was pushed aside and she's pissed about it. Dinner was an opportunity for the two of you to spend time alone together like her sister had for 2 years. Put some serious quality time in with her (just the two of you!!!!) before you ruin any chance of a relationship at all. Don't push her yo have a relationship with her sister. It will just drive her away.", "This captures what I wanted to say as well. OP is clearly disdainful towards Jenny and blind to her own preference.", "\"you don't seem to care a lot anyway.\" Really seems to encompass the problem.", "Not to mention after two years in the new place she was probably making friends and feeling settled and whelp, time to move you again because we are ready for you to come home now, so once again she uprooted and unsettled.", "This is it exactly. \n\nAnd also: it\u2019s completely normal to want to spend time with your kids one-on-one even in completely normal, but lopsided families. I spend time with my children individually as well as together, because shocker, I like them.", "No visits to her, a few visits back home. Sounds rough.", "Everything is about Tara in the moms mind.", "I bet she still went with Tara anyway. Just because Jenny changed her mind about going doesn't mean they should waste their reservation, right? Eurgh. My heart is breaking for Jenny.", "Read the comments from OP she is most definitely biased toward Tara.", "You have the daughters mixed up, it was the older one who was sick and the younger one that was sent to MIL.", "This. She needs therapy, and you all need group family therapy. This was a traumatizing experience for everyone. I understand your reasoning for sending her to your MIL and I'm not here to say if it was the right or wrong choice. But of COURSE Jenny feels separate because she was literally sent away from the rest of the family. Not to mention leaving all her friends and attending a different school for 2 years, I'm assuming? Again, this was an awful situation and you had to make tough choices. But now that Tara is healed you all have some healing to do too", "Honestly, I\u2019m seeing a future where Jenny lives with dad and Tara lives with mom.\n\nEdited because I had the names reversed.", "Exactly! You say you want them to bond as sisters as well but Jenny isn\u2019t ready yet. Take one step at a time. Think about it from Jenny\u2019s perspective.\n\nWhile Tara was having the worst moments of her life, you were there. Jenny was also having the worst moments of hers: she had to live in a new environment with new rules and her sister was very sick (possibly dying).  Jenny didn\u2019t have her parents to help get her through that, she probably felt like she was figuring it all out alone. Yeah, an adult who has had some life experiences could probably have the perspective (and emotional tools) to deal, but she didn\u2019t.\n\n I don\u2019t think sending her to live with your MIL was the wrong choice, but I do think you\u2019re fumbling now by clearly not empathizing with Jenny\u2019s emotional needs. I think you want to, but you\u2019re stuck on hyper-caretaker mode with Tara. You need to make sure Jenny feels safe and secure the same way you did for Tara.", "They never visited her. They called \u201cregularly\u201d, but Jenny was visiting them, the parents never went to the MILs house over the two years.  \n\nIf Jenny wanted to see her parents she was expected to make the effort.", "This is the point where I start thinking, this can\u2019t be real right? What parent would be ok with not visiting or not having some sort of monthly visit schedule where MIL brings her down for a weekend or she takes public transportation? It makes no sense to me. I mean, maybe I just know really overbearing parents but my experiences of moms/dads is that this wouldn\u2019t be bearable for them. I know OP is taking heat here but the lack of info about dad as well makes me wonder", "She said they never visited cause \u201cthey couldn\u2019t\u201d but she came home a few times. I\u2019m surprised she came home at all. I would have stayed where I was wanted.", "Occasional (not regular) phone calls, no visits. Jenny came home for visits 5 times in the 2 years.", "I don\u2019t want to assume but from Op comments and from the clear signs that Op still puts Tara in a pedestal.. I will assume that Jenny will be all happy and joyfully.. and to accept Tara as her sister.. \n\nI think she doesn\u2019t have resentment towards her dad because he did try to keep a distance relationship with her or that he gave her space until she was comfortable with him or that he is actively trying to fix the relationship and make time for her.", "The dynamic is above Reddit, but the more the OP responds the clearer it is she's being TA. She has misguided expectations and her own set of emotional traumas to deal with. But the way she talks about her daughter and husband... She is showing she would be a pill to be around for anyone not named Tara. That must change before too much more damage is done.", "Not to mention they also didn\u2019t visit Jenny for the 2 years she was away. She came home \u201ca few times\u201d. \n\nYeah, I wonder why the 14 yo isn\u2019t thrilled to be around her mom and sister.", "OP appears to have zero empathy for Jenny.  That\u2019s what\u2019s so concerning.  No wonder Jenny wonders if her mom loves her.  I sure wonder that myself.", "Agreed. Soft YTA. Getting Jenny, and likely the entire family, therapy might go a long way towards helping. Look, I get it, when you have a seriously chronically ill child your entire focus and life because helping them live. I had that situation. But at the same time you cannot lose sight of the fact that you have another healthy daughter who needs you just as much as Tara. Being able to navigate the needs of both girls isn't easy, but you need to change some behaviors and put some effort into making Jenny feel like part of the family too. This is a big reason I have always oppose sending kids away when a parent or sibling is seriously ill. They are part of the family, and big feelings will pop up. Don't isolate them. Kids will feel like they've been rejected by everyone.", "You got the names flipped I believe", "You interchanged the names I think.", "You mixed up the sisters. Tara was the sick one, not Jenny. Jenny was the one who was sent away and who OP continues to emotionally neglect.", "But op said she called when they could, doesn\u2019t that count for something /s", "730 days of total failure\u2026.", "By sending her away you took away a valuable bonding experience between sisters. \nJenny would have been more aware of what's going on and and she might have developed empathy for her sister instead of animosity", "Yeah I initially thought this was a soft YTA too but it\u2019s a full blown yikes from me at several of OP\u2019s comments, unfortunately.", "THATS WHAT IM SAYING!\n\nOp should answer these questions because it will make it more clear why Jenny is treating Tara that way. There is something Op is clearly hiding if she is still putting how Tara feels above how Jenny feels. That relationship will take months.. or years to be repaired. I will say Op NEEDS to take it slow and should be speeding time 1 on 1 with only Jenny.\n\n\nI have resentment towards my little brother but I don\u2019t blame him for it.. I blame my parents for making me feel that way. Always showing favoritism, always showing him more love and understanding. But when it came to me I either was told to act my age, manage my anger problems or to shut up if I don\u2019t want to lose my life.", "This. Everyone saying yta seems to be putting their own trauma into the mix.", "It's really not though. OP abandoned her daughter, probably at a very scary time given that the daughter's sister was in the hospital for two years, and now is trying to act like nothing happened. And when the daughter tries to tell her parents why she's upset, and clearly states she wants one on one time with her mom, her feelings are dismissed.\n\nWhile they 100% need therapy, it is very, very clearly a YTA situation. You don't just get to abandon your child for two years then act like nothing happened and be completely perplexed as to why the child may be upset.", "OP states they didn't even visit Jenny. They called her. On the phone. Having one sick child doesn't mean you just get to ship out the healthy one and bring her home when its convienent again 2 years later. Mom and dad did not need to spend every second of every day with Tara. I had a sick child. My husband and I took turns so that our other 2 kids still had a mom and dad. Life was difficult but we faced it as a family. I can't even imagine sending one of my kids away for 2 years. That's just messed up.", "Spot on.  \n\nJenny feels neglect due to the time and attention you rightfully dedicated to Tara and is acting out because of it.  Teenagers sometimes behave irrationally due to their physical, emotional, and hormonal changes.  \n\nExplain to her you love her no less than you love Tara.  You and your husband had to spend more time on Tara because of her illness and not because of favoritism.  Good luck to your family.\n\nNTA", "It also sounds like OP is trying to micromanage the sister's relationship. It would not be that hard to plan a girls night with Jenny without Tara there. Tara has had two years, Jenny deserves one night.", "This family is a mess. Both kids are going to be so traumatised.", "Agree, but OP needs to stop pushing a bond with her sister. Jenny needs therapy to process her anger and resentment. Pushing a relationship will only root those feeling more.", "Yea as a silver lining, this is very common and has a lot of research and evidence based practice behind it. Nothing that OP can navigate with effort and time. I just hope Jenny is able to work through her feelings, I\u2019m glad she has atleast found solace in her dad", "Did you really just accuse Jenny, a child who was thrown out of her home by her parents when she was 12, of being a bully for wanting attention from her mother after she spent two years in a whole other city with zero visits from her parents? I hope you don't have kids because they are in for a wild fucking ride with your absolute 0 emotional intelligence.\n\nOP was fine spending two years on Tara with literally zero effort to even see Jenny, while she can't even spend a single night with Jenny without Tara. I can't imagine the pain Jenny must be feeling, OP makes it so clear that Tara is the only one she cares about. Meanwhile if you read her comments, she even resents her husband for showing some affection to Jenny.", "I want to say I agree but my question is how is Tara reacting to Jenny being there and having 1 parent attention a lot. Or how is Tara as a person before Jenny left. There is so many questions that I bet op will dogged because it will show the people how much she cares about her daughters and how she views the relationship.", "There's no evidence that the dad's ignoring Tara, at all. All OP said is that Jenny only spends time with him, not that he only spends time with her. The dad doesn't deserve any blame in this.", "She only visited with her daughter less than 5 times in two years.  She is TA just for that reason.", "This was posted 40 mins ago?", "She said they never visited, but that Jenny visited them a couple of times. So her parents never even came to what was her home, never saw her room, didn't meet her friends. I would be heartbroken.", "Wow. Thank you!", "Not even on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or her birthday? That's crazy.", "What a mess. I have more sympathy for her than most people do here - dad was working two jobs to keep them afloat and mum was in the hospital trying to hold it together - but Jenny really did get sacrificed in all this. \n\nTo me the real villain of the story though is a healthcare system where a parent has to work two jobs to pay for medical needs for their child. What a different situation this would have been if that wasn\u2019t the case,", "Yes. I'm the other sibling. I'm also the oldest. I was expected to act like an adult in many ways long before I was an actual adult. My emotional needs were frequently ignored. It took a lot of therapy for me to even realize how inappropriately my parents treated me due to my sibling's illnesses.", "Definitely some truth to that, my little sister was born with a serious lifelong illness and I had a lot of resentment while I was growing up and didn\u2019t truly understand why all the time they were in the hospital with her and I was being sent to be with my aunt and uncle or grandparents place", "Yasssss. A just them thing!! And having it scheduled weekly or biweekly is great. Once you set the days dont let anything change it. That'll feel unimportant so make sure it's a day or time you can commit to Jenny.", "Uh, they both need therapy. What\u2019s with this disregard for the child who had to endure the trauma of 2 years of hospitals? Both have had it extremely rough - one lost their parents for 2 years, and one lost all semblance of normality, structure, faith in their own body, and spent 2 years in constant pain. Both are extremely unsettling, and to say only the former requires therapy is short sighted.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s an easy ride being diagnosed with a major illness or acquiring a disability?", "Very well said!!", "Poor Jenny.", "That makes me incredibly sad for Jenny :( OP will be one of those moms acting confused when her daughter goes NC when she's older. The fact she had to ask this question shows how out of touch she is with that poor child's feelings.", "What would have been the right move in this scenario?  It sounds like the options were:\n\n1. Both kids effectively live in a hospital for 2 years \n2. Leave a sick kid alone in the hospital for large swaths of time for 2 years\n3. Send the healthy kid to MIL's in hopes she can live a \"more normal\" life for 2 years\n\n14 year olds aren't self-sufficient or rational.  If they had tried to give Jenny a normal life at home or some compromised form of it they'd have a scared and hurt 15 year old bitter at being left alone in the hospital while her sister gets to eat breakfast and dinner with mom at home.\n\nEvery option sounds terrible, option #3 sounds like the least terrible?  I'm not saying she's not the AH in this particular instance, but I don't know that there was any right move.", "Agreed, neither daughter is to blame here, they\u2019re both just kids.", "So Tara should never be forced to make amends. That I agree.\n\nAnd I hope I didnt imply that Tara had any responsibility for amends. The responsibility of amends is STRICTLY on the parents. The parents are at fault and no one else. Tara didn't chose to be sick or send her sister away. That's the parents.\n\nThe only thing I feel Tara should have is a simple understanding that her parents treated her sister really shitty while she was sick and that has cause some major resentment . While it's not her fault at all, she shouldn't be on team \"push relationship\" and to just let it be for now. Don't push herself onto her sister and let her the time she needs to heal. And to just stay out of the parents part too. She should focus on her health and not what her parents did.\n\nEdit: sorry phone made me think this was a reply to my comment not a brand new one.", ">*but staying at home would've meant she was at the hospital all the time*.\n\nRespectfully disagree. Tara has a mom and a dad in the picture. They did not both need be with Tara all the time. Parents of sick kids do it all the time. My husband and I had to do it. It is possible to still parent your healthy kids. Not ship them off for 2 years.", "The reason I stand by this statement is for the simple fact is OP never visited her daughter. Not once. Jenny if she wanted to see them was required to go to THEM. Not the other way around.\n\nOP couldn't tell you how her daughters new room was decorated or what the colors the walls were. Because they never stepped foot in that room.\n\nJenny was expected to do the labor of visits while OP felt other than that calls were sufficient.\n\nTwo years. And they NEVER went to visit their daughter and left everything on that little girls shoulders. \n\nThat's why I feel it their wasn't a thought about sending her away", "Yeah, it feels like you'd need way more information to judge the sending her to live with her grandmother part.  Dad's working two jobs and if we assume mom really did need to be with the other daughter the whole time, what should they have done?  If they sent her across the country for two years and never saw or spoke to her that would be messed up, but if it was nearby and they were still in her life that seems like a reasonable idea.  In the end it doesn't really matter much for this situation though, because it would be totally reasonable for her to want some one on one time with her mother even absent all the rest.", "OP never mentioned how the daughter felt about it. Did she even want to go live with her family?", "They never even visited her when she was away. She didn't see her parents for two entire years.", "It would have been better if she had stayed. My 3 year old had cancer and he has 3 older siblings. We did everything we could to keep their lives as normal as possible. They did he a to spend some nights with family or friends but they stayed in the same schools and same after school activities and visited in the hospital when they could. This child was completely abandoned by her parents for the sick sister. They handled this completely wrong. There was no need to send her away. They could have taken turns being at the hospital with Tara or home with Jenny", "She was 12, no kid this age can completely grasp it might be better.\nAnd I doubt OP and husband spend 2 years 24h/7days at the hospital, and even so, they have 2 children, one does not deserves to be sent away for 2 years like a random package for the sake of the other", "She likes Dad because Dad is making an effort to spend one on one time with her. Maybe Dad is dropping the ball on home stuff, or cooking, or cleaning, or helping Tara and he should be stepping up so you get to spend time with Jenny. \n\nBut if you INSIST on bringing Tara into any bonding time or just ANYTHING with Tara you're going to ruin all of your relationships. Talk with Jenny. Say you're sorry and you fucked up doing what you thought was the best solution at the worst of times. Tell her you love her dearly and never mean to hurt her. DONT MENTION TARA.\n\nStart doing a hobby together that's just you and Jenny. You could diamond painting, cross stitch, embroidery, take a sewing class, go to the gym, movie night once a week. You can also do a night with Tara too, but don't bring her to the ones with your other daughter. And make sure it's a different activity Christ on a Cracker. \n\nBut you need to step up here and show your daughter you love her. Stop being defensive. Don't argue with her. Let her be angry: she's 14, you didn't visit her for TWO YEARS, you sent her away and she feels like you abandoned her. And you kinda did OP. She has every right to be mad. \n\nSay sorry. She'll respect you more for it.", "Hearing it laid out like this... Doing what this woman did with her human daughter would be sooo cruel to do to even a pet... Now I dislike OP even more", "This is too harsh. Having a sick child is really tough and the position may have been either Jenny is dragged to the hospital with no one to take her to and from school, no one to make her dinner etc, no chance of normalcy\u2026 or go to grandmas. Remember, dads working two jobs and mums essentially on her own here. \n\nI hope Jenny got a say in whether she toughed it out at home or if she went away, as well as if and when she came back but still. You need a little empathy for the mum even if she is TA in this instance.", "Man, the visits were also expected from Jenny, huh. \n\nTotally get that OP had to ship Jenny off to take care of Tara as it could take a toll, but as she's stable now, OP should focus on Jenny too.", "I have empathy for her, Tara is doing better so Mom figured the family could go back to normal, completely neglecting what Jenny went through.  Actually turns out I don\u2019t have as much empathy as I thought.\nEdit: typo", "Thanks, I'll fix it now", "Yes. Also when you bring up therapy, don't make it like Jenny is the only one who needs it. It will only make her feel even more isolated. You all went through hard things together in different ways.", "Jenny hates her mom and Tara why would she live with her mom", "Maybe if they get their own Bravo show first.", "Yeah, that's pretty bogus. I saw that in OP's follow-up comments. Interesting she chose not to mention the fact that she completely abandoned her daughter for 2 years and now she's acting shocked that Jenny wants nothing to do with her.", "Jesus wept. If I was Jenny I wouldn\u2019t have went back. What a shitty pair of \u201cparents\u201d. I get the other kid was sick but that excuse never visiting.", "Right. It's a little bizarre that OP was able to basically cut out the rest of the world to solely focus on her daughter. But the fact that she made the choice to not leave the hospital for 2 years to see her other daughter and not give her husband the chance to spend some 1:1 time with Tara is just straight up weird.", "Yeah I started off at \u201csoft YTA\u201d but every comment from OP pushes me further into the view that she\u2019s  doing everything except look for ways to improve the situation. It\u2019s a real shame for the rest of the family.", "Well shit.im going to fix that now", "I get op is trying to fix the damage, but dinners ain't gonna cut it.", "Jesus. Poor kid.", "Thanks I didnt saw that, definetly the AH in that case.\n\nHopefully she will understand now and will try to repair the relationship", "Exactly this. Messed up. Who the fuck just ships off their kid? Then has no idea why she is upset with her. Glad lots of people in the comments are echoing this. Hopefully it will be a wake up call for the OP, but she seems to be oblivious to other points of view so far. Looking forward to the update/edit", "OP specified that Jenny has been bullying Tara. Did you even read the post? Hell did you even read my comment? I specifically addressed her feeling are understandable, but her actions (the bullying OP specifically mentioned) were unacceptable. Sounds like you shouldn't have kids with how easy you fly off the handle because you didn't pay attention to the details.", "She said in another comment the Dad is dropping anything Tara needs to tend to Jenny. So he basically reversed kids.", "Yeah, the follow up responses from OP tell the full story. OP needs therapy, she is holding her own set of resentment to Jenny and husband. OP's world clearly still revolves around Tara. I get that due to the last 2 years, but she has to adjust or the others in her life will move on...", "Thats....even worse", "Welcome!", "Sorry you had to go through that.", "Sometimes there just isn't a right move", "OP lost me when she said neither parents visited their own child in person for 2 years. Oh, but Jenny visited home \"a few times\". If OP can't be bothered to focus on Jenny now, how focused was she during her calls when Tara was in the hospital?\n\nAnd now Jenny's dragged back home. How many friends did she lose both times moving? What normalcy did she have when her exile didn't have an end date. If Tara gets sick again will Jenny be shipped away again?\n\nIt's still parental neglect.\n\nAlthough could be ragebait with OP's latest comment about how she's the better parent because she used to call more than the dad.", "Yeah, if you read her replies, she just isn\u2019t getting it.", "It sounds like she\u2019s more annoyed that Jenny doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her precious Tara, then actually wanting a relationship with Jenny herself.", "I did.  She is the worst.  I have two kids.  The youngest has ASD, and I know sometimes the oldest gets lost in the shuffle. I acknowledge that because it is real and try super hard to always find time for the two of us.  No parent is perfect and I fail a lot but she is completely incapable of seeing what they put Jenny through.  12 to 14 are super important years for a girl, in all likelihood her mother missed so many milestones.", "It really does, and that's a shame. Micromanaging her daughters' relationship with each other is not going to be helpful here. I also wonder how Tara feels about all this. She didn't ask to be sick. She may not have even wanted her mom on top of her all the time. She didn't get a choice about that either. Mom has made a right mess of things but doesn't seem to take much responsibility for those choices.", "She comments that Tara has asked her dad to take her places (ends up being thwarted by Jenny, but that\u2019s not the point), so it sounds like she\u2019d like some time away from her Mom. \n\nI would guess that everyone but Mom wants some one on one time with each other.", "Mom needs a therapist. I'm sure she's got some sort of issues as a result of what's happened with Tara. Tara needs to reestablish relationships with her dad and sister but Mom needs to stay the heck out of it and let them sort out their own issues. She definitely shouldn't be mediating things between the sisters because Mom is a sore spot that brings up resentment. This is a messy situation that they really need the help of a professional to navigate.", "YTA anyway but you\u2019re REALLY TA when you read the replies in the comments. My god. \n\nGet ready to lose Jenny. When she\u2019s 18, she will never speak to you or Tara again. And that will be on you.", "As someone that worked with with families who had/has kids with cancer, you all need therapy. Both individual and family. It\u2019s reasonable for Jenny to have feelings if abandonment, especially if you still aren\u2019t trying to do one on one activities with her. Spending alone time with Jenny doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re abandoning Tara. YTA for not realizing how hurt Jenny feels.", "YTA, all I can say is just wow. And that update? Just icing on the cake. You need to go to therapy. Guarantee that your daughter will be one of those kids who moves out and never talks to you unless you change your attitude and behavior.", "Holy crap, YTA. \n\nYes, you could have left her alone sometimes to go see your daughter who was not sick, just alone.\n\nNo, leaving her at home for one dinner is not neglecting her. \n\nYour husband worked two jobs to pay the bills and you're saying he neglected her? You'll have to say a lot more than that for me to see neglect. \n\nJenny is a glass child - she feels invisible and unloved. Taking her out to dinner isn't about *you*, it's about her. It's about building that bond. And turning to Tara and ignoring Jenny, instead of reaching out and asking her about what's on her phone and what interests her, that's a huge selfish AH move. \nYour daughter is being abandoned by her mother and turns to the only parent she feels safe around - her dad. \n\nSounds like you only have one daughter and your husband has the other.

I had fewer children; their baby sister is 6 years younger and the only child we had after.  I spent one-on-one time.  I gave her unlimited access to her sister, even when our homecare nurses didn't like it.  We moved states, abandoning a house we couldn't sell and renting for 4 years so we could physically manage being together and all the hospital needs along with the needs of a healthy child.\n\nYour parents needed to do more.  They may not have known how, but it was needed.  You deserved more. \n\nMy oldest is now 14.  She's grown enough to express feelings she didn't know how to when she was younger.  Seeing the pain I didn't know she struggled with is hell, but it's real and it's hers.  I let her say what she needs and we're both in therapy.\n\nI wish your mother had done the same for you.", "Please listen to this. \n\nMy dad was an infant in Switzerland in WWII.

My brother had a lot of health problems and all of my mom's focus was on him. She couldn't figure out why I loved my dad more even though he was the only one who gave me any kind of love or attention. I barely existed to her unless it was to do chores, or if I did something wrong, to emotionally support her while she broke down over my brother, or to be her emotional punching bag who she took all her negative feelings out on. It really fucked me up. As I got older and my brother's health needs became less I would try to mend our relationship. I would try to do things like go out to dinner but she never did it. She did however spend a lot of time with her friends and their daughters/kids. Eventually I gave up. \n\nKids need one on one time with their parents period but when someone like my mother or op spend a *significant* amount of time with one child because of an illness it's even more important to carve out time to give devoted attention to the other.

I'm only 2 years older than him so pretty much from the time I can remember it was all about him and making sure he was ok. Even growing up knowing this I still felt angry and resentful. Actually used to be very close with my brother. It was very much \"my brother's keeper\". But as I went into my teenage years things changed. It's such a hard time for kids anyway but feeling unloved and like you might as well not exist to your parent is such an awful feeling. \n\nI understood the reason why but it didn't really matter.

The following summer was the same.  When she was at home with daddy, he still had to work.  Even being babysat by her friends parents, she was depressed.

The distance made it impossible for me to leave my baby, then 1 year old who couldn't advocate for herself and would have spent days alone except for the moments of necessary medical care.\n\nI didn't send my daughter away for my convenience.  It tore me apart being distant from her.  I did it because she'd come home from being babysat, skip dinner, and go to bed before 5 pm.  I did it because we couldn't meet her needs.  She missed me every day.  I called every day, several times, even when I had to step out of the hospital to do so.  I spent hours with her on the weekends they came, sometimes just cuddling and reading books.  And I moved away from a community I loved for both girls, but the decision that the hospital could be no more than an hour from home was for my healthy child.\n\nIt's not the same for everyone.

As much as I hate it, being the sick kid meant that my siblings didn't get as much of my mom's attention. And I understood that because my mom sat me down and explained it to me. It wasn't my fault for being sick but that didn't mean my mom got to abandon her responsibility to her other kids. When I was finally well enough for our family to re-assimiliate, my mom would usually take out one of the kids for a personal day that was just about them.

In two years?  Was your husband working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, every week of those two years?  You're lying.  You could have made it work.

Wanting some time just the two of you _isn't neglecting Tara_.\n\n> Tara was sick for 2 years, she is finally starting to have a normal life and I should just neglect her like her dad?\n\nJenny didn't have a normal life for two years either.  Instead, she got uprooted _twice_, and she couldn't get any actual support from you.  Instead, what she's getting is further neglect because she doesn't feel loved.  Let me reiterate that, OP: She does not feel loved, because she hasn't been your sole focus for even a few hours, in over two years.  Every child deserves that.\n\n> And what is the point really? Talking from experience, Jenny would be on her phone ignoring me the entire time, this way at least I had someone to talk to when Jenny was so busy ignoring me.\n\nSo deal with it like a goddess-damned adult.  Let her know that she is able to trust you, that you care.  Instead, you just made her feel like a burden, all over again.

Sit there in silence if you have to, but _do not ever do this again_.  This just once again showed her that you cannot be trusted.  _No wonder she ignores you_.

It's hard not just on the sick child or the parents.", " Well you kicked your kid out at puberty, the most confusing and traumatic period in a woman\u2019s life. \nGo figure she doesn\u2019t like you or the girl who who was responsible for her exile. \n\nOut of curiosity, was MIL a good mother to her? Did she resent being saddled with a young teen? \nWas she equipped to mother a teen in 2023, or did she mother like it was still 1985? \nDid the girl find friends in middle school? Was she the weird new girl who lived with grandma and bullied mercilessly for being vulnerable? \n\nCan you honestly answer those question? \n\n\n\nIf you honestly have no idea what her life was like, why would you expect her to ever forgive you?", "YTA omg horribly. \n\nStop playing the martyr. You chose to stay by Tara\u2019s side in the hospital all in and neglect your other daughter. Every hospital would have understood you have another daughter to take care of and she would have been in good hands with them. Unfortunately you\u2019re not the only family this happened to. \n\nI\u2019ll bet it made you feel good to be so needed by Tara. \n\nI\u2019ll bet sending Jenny off to live with grandparents made you feel like a martyr too during that time.

No one is blaming you for spending time with your sick child and being in the hospital with her. And \"neglecting\" Tara is also not the solution that people are suggesting either. You went 2 years with presumably 0 visits to Jenny. I understand that you *couldnt* leave and that you tried to be a part of her life by calling her, but a relationship with your 14 year old cannot be sustained on the phone. Im sure you cohldve gotten away once in 2 years to maybe do something as simple as just getting lunch with Jenny. It's shocking that you're surprised that she is this upsst and not more \"mature.\" She's 14!

You abandoned her no matter the reason and made Tara the target (again doesn\u2019t matter the reason because at end of day they are still children, YOUR children not just Child!). Jenny needed her PARENTS as well but instead it was just phoned in no wonder she\u2019s on her phone all time because that\u2019s what you showed her.

Jenny will never be able to forgive Tara if you don't take responsibility for the decisions made and re-eablish your bond with Jenny first. You can't drag Tara along on the first step of the journey and expect it will all be OK if you all pretend it never happened.\n\n2. Tara is OK now. You need to let go a bit. You were basically the only person she saw for 2 years on a personal level and that was every single day, day in and day out. You can't keep that level of attachment to her and expect her to have the ability to develop normal relationships. She needs to re-establish relationships w/ her dad, her grandparents, her friends and eventually her sister. She needs to do all of those things w/o you smothering her. You can support her, but she has to do it on your own. She also needs time alone to discover herself. For 2 years all she has been is \"the sick kid\" and all you have been is \"the sick kid's caring mother\". You both need to change this dynamic for the good of not only yourselves, but your husband and Jenny. Talk to Tara, discuss it with her to make sure she doesn't feel abandonded, but Tara spending time without you is a good thing and likely something she craves but can't say it.", "Just reading OPs comments are painful. She's just \"me me me, my feelings, lalala\" and getting defensive at everyone. She doesn't even seem to care how Jenny has been affected.", "Not including Tara for one dinner is seen as \"neglect\" but not including Jenny for 2 years in the actual family is totally fine apparently. This isn't lost on Jenny. It's just another comparison where Tara and her feelings are obviously more important to OP.\n\nI'm also curious as to what \"neglect\" from the husband OP is talking about in the edit. Is it by spending time with his other daughter he's barely seen in two years? Sounds like he's spent the last two years working his ass off for his family and just wants to enjoy being a dad for once.", "I may be wrong, but I really wonder if Jenny is actually \"bullying\" Tara, or just acting like a normal sister while Mom frets over poor little Tara who can't be treated with anything less than kid gloves?", "I think these parts together are also pretty telling: \n\n> my husband had to work 2 jobs to be able to pay for the hospital\n\n>Tara was sick for 2 years, she is finally starting to have a normal life and I should just neglect her like her dad?\n\n...dad worked two jobs for two years to pay for everything and spent some of his leftover time with the girl who wasn't in the hospital, *clearly* he's neglecting the girl in the hospital who has mom waiting hand and foot on her.", "Jenny isn't bullying Tara. That's just what OP is saying to gain sympathy points. Jenny was just asking to be a priority for once in her life, but Martyr Mom can't see it. She doesn't really even seem to like Jenny.", "Exactly this! Not including Tara in an activity or two is not neglect. While Tara may have been sick and that was scary for her, her mum was there to support her. Jenny has had to turn to her grandmother for support this whole time instead.", "I read the first couple of paragraphs fully expecting to be on OP's side, but when she went into detail that she's never made an effort to spend time with Jenny without Tara and described all of that, OP definitely needs a YTA. \n\nDue to a work situation I chose to leave my 13 yr old daughter with my mother for six months so she could finish the school year, which is something she asked to do. I flew home every other weekend, prioritized time with her, and stayed in touch via text, etc. \n\nWhen she came to live with me she was still angry, even though she could articulate the reasons why she'd stayed behind and had repeatedly asked to finish the school year at the only school she'd ever attended. \n\nYoung teens often logically understand things but their feelings are in conflict with what they know. \n\nYou can't hold that against them. It's part of development. We talked through her feelings, as often and as long as she wanted. I supported her, made time for her, and we worked through it. Today - as a fully grown adult - she has great memories of that time with her grandmother and we laugh about the crazy schedule and my \"memory gap\" of all the things she did while I was away.\n\nLeaving a child in a safe and loving environment during a time of chaos does not make a parent an asshole. Doing absolutely nothing to understand and support the child makes you an asshole.", ">I should just neglect her like her dad?\n\nTheir dad didn't neglect them, according to you he worked 2 jobs so you could be by your daughters hospital bed side. \n\nHaving a sick child is hard but you had 2 kids and neglected 1. Which you're still doing. Even if Tara was still ill there's nothing saying you spending one-on-one time with Jenny meant you'd be neglecting Tara.", "THIS, plus, are you 14? Of course she is going to be on the phone and ignore you, you have to show her you are there for her, even if she appears to not be engaging.  Your willingness to be present with her is part of the process. You might want to consider family therapy, I understand why you dedicated yourself 100% to your sick daughter but you did it at Jenny's expense. It was not Jenny's fault Tara got sick and Jenny was literally farmed out without being included in that decision. You were in a difficult situation and what you thought best. You probably also need to step away from Tara (she needs to become her own independent person) and practice some self care and re-establish the relationship with Jenny. Edited because I forgot: YTA", "The edit makes this even worse.  OP YTA", "Yeah. And this lady is making this all about her and how tired and out upon she is. She clearly favors Tara.

I'm the mom to a medically complex guy who was often in the hospital and just passed away at age 6, plus 4 other kids. OP, you claim you didn't mean to, but you 100% chose your sick daughter over your healthy daughter. At 12, a girl needs her parents to regularly tell her she matters. Instead, you chose to completely ignore her in favor of her sister during the most crucial period of adolescent development. You told her she's not important enough to get ANY of your time. She may have understood (but still likely been jealous) living with grandma if you still made time to see her very regularly and take a personal interest in things that matter to her, that aren't related to her sister, but you didn't. Yes, that would have meant leaving your sick daughter \"alone\" with nurses for a couple hours, but instead you chose to effectively abandon your healthy daughter. She was just as alone while you were in the hospital. Don't you see the double standard of what you're willing to subject your daughters to? Do you care that she went through the super scary experience of losing her entire family without any parental support?\n\nAnd yes, she should have spent significant time in the hospital with you. She needed her mom and her sister, not to be ripped from her family. Siblings of medically complex children don't get \"normal\" childhoods. Losing your parents and sister for two years isn't normal. Instead, you should have let her be a part of the family. Sometimes family goes through sucky things together. But being a family means doing them together. Congratulations for telling her she's not a part of your family.\n\nNow that her sister is healthy, you still won't give her any 1:1 time? After giving her sister TWO YEARS of 1:1 time? Of course she's jealous! You effectively told her that her sister is significantly more important than her. It will take years to repair your relationship, if there's any hope that it ever will be repaired. And going out to eat 1:1 once won't fix it. You really need to do something with her 1:1 at least weekly if you hope to matter in her life, to tell her you care about her at all, to undo the damage of abandoning her for TWO YEARS.\n\nAnd don't be surprised that it takes hard work and intentionality to connect to her. Of course she wants to be on the phone when around you. You're a complete stranger at this point who stabbed her in the back emotionally. You need to put serious work into your relationship before she values time with you. And that's on you, not her. Don't blame her for guarding herself against being hurt by you again.\n\nYTA. As a medical mom, I can't believe you're using your daughter's diagnosis to defend yourself. It's unfair to both your daughters.

She\u2019s created a situation where Jenny is just going to keep resenting Tara unless it\u2019s addressed and where Tara is therefore around a sister who resents her.

I want to adopt the daughter.", "and we can acknowledge that Jenny might ask dad to do things at the same time he has plans with Tara to see if he will pick her. To see if she is worthy of being first to someone. and because her dad picks her she actually has a relationship with him.", "Yes. That is really really poor parenting. And even in families where there are no special needs children, parents will favor one child over another.", "Yep!  \"Neglect\" is \"anything where my precious formerly-sick child isn't given attention\", I am 99.9% positive.", "She also wanted to bring Tara so she would have someone to talk to while Jenny was busy on her phone ignoring her\u2026 \n\nHow can someone be so completely clueless\u2026.", "Seriously, she's got \"martyr complex\" written all over her.", "YTA\nYou know, your edit makes your logic sound even more illogical to me\n\nTara was sick so you gave all your time to her and didn\u2019t consider Jenny\u2019s feelings \n\nNow that Tara is better, Jenny\u2019s requests for you to give her private mother-daughter time is considered Jenny demanding you to neglect Tara?\n\nWhy don\u2019t you think that you neglected and still neglects Jenny? \n\nNow that Tara is well enough to not be hospitalised, do you hold the same standards you have towards Jenny towards Tara as well? \n\nSince both of them sounds relatively fine physically, isn\u2019t it fine for you to rebuild your relationship with Jenny unless you\u2019re thinking that Tara would be unwell the moment you have a mother-daughter time with Jenny. \n\nJust like what others have said, you all should consider family therapy unless you\u2019re fine losing a daughter.", ">And what is the point really? Talking from experience, Jenny would be on her phone ignoring me the entire time\n\nTelling on yourself a bit there. \n\nYTA", "YTA and your edit made it worse. You completely neglected Jenny for two years and even now that Tara is healthy you clearly prefer your older daughter over your younger one.\n\n>And what is the point really? Talking from experience, Jenny would be on her phone ignoring me the entire time, this way at least I had someone to talk to when Jenny was so busy ignoring me.\n\nThis sounds just so harsh and like you don't even want to truly try to repair your relationship with Jenny and as have your favorite daughter after all. \n\nAnd now you even criticize your husband for trying to compensate your neglect and clear favoritism if Tara.\n\n>I should just neglect her like her dad       \n>and neglect Tara because of her which is what my husband is doing   \n\nYour husband clearly wants that Jenny feels at least loved by one parent, because she clearly doesn't believe you care about her. And I bet he doesn't even neglect Tara. You likely only think so as his life doesn't completely resolve around her alone like it is the case with you. \n\nWhy did you post even here if you are so convinced that you are not the asshole here? Did you believe that everyone would side with you, so that you can show the replies to your husband and Jenny to coerce them to be nicer to you and Tara or something like that?", "Especially the last sentence. Both parents need to stop their current behavior. Mom needs to start paying attention to her youngest daughter. And Dad needs to stop buying his youngest daughter love.\n\nThey can't change what they decided 2 years ago. They should focus on the future and how to heal their relationship with their youngest daughter in a healthy way.", "Not to mention, she stated the idea of leaving Tara and going with Jenny only would be \u201cneglect\u201d. \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\n\nTHEN proceeded to attack husband/dad.", "It sounds like YTA and still defending yourself in the edits, why ask if you don't accept the answers to your question ? Yes having a sick child must be absolute hell and Tara could rely on her mother any minute of every day while she was in that situation but her sister couldn't, and that for 2 years, 2 years she'll never get back. You can give her 2 hours of alone time so YES YTA.", "Oh I wholeheartedly agree with this! OP, I\u2019m sorry your family had to go through this and I hope Tara makes a full recovery \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79 But in this case YTA. \n\nAlso- Jeg hader ogs\u00e5 statistik! Cudos til dit username \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Sounds like she didn't visit because poor Tara would have been all alone!

Like, what is she characterizing as Jenny bullying Tara?  Jenny having friends other than Tara?  Jenny not wanting to time with Tara?  Or are there actual bullying things that Jenny has done?\n\nIt seems like both of them came home to a situation where they don\u2019t have school friends and whatnot because Jenny was out of town and Tara was hospitalized.", "I'm pretty sure she's calling her husband \"neglectful\" for anything less than \"always including Tara in everything\", so... yeah, that tracks.", "Yep. I'm the mom to a medically complex guy who was often in the hospital and just passed away at age 6, plus 4 other kids. OP, you claim you didn't mean to, but you 100% chose your sick daughter over your healthy daughter. At 12, a girl needs her parents to regularly tell her she matters. Instead, you chose to completely ignore her in favor of her sister during the most crucial period of adolescent development. You told her she's not important enough to get ANY of your time. She may have understood (but still likely been jealous) living with grandma if you still made time to see her very regularly and take a personal interest in things that matter to her, that aren't related to her sister, but you didn't. Yes, that would have meant leaving your sick daughter \"alone\" with nurses for a couple hours, but instead you chose to effectively abandon your healthy daughter. She was just as alone while you were in the hospital. Don't you see the double standard of what you're willing to subject your daughters to? Do you care that she went through the super scary experience of losing her entire family without any parental support?\n\nAnd yes, she should have spent significant time in the hospital with you. She needed her mom and her sister, not to be ripped from her family. Siblings of medically complex children don't get \"normal\" childhoods. Losing your parents and sister for two years isn't normal. Instead, you should have let her be a part of the family. Sometimes family goes through sucky things together. But being a family means doing them together. Congratulations for telling her she's not a part of your family.\n\nNow that her sister is healthy, you still won't give her any 1:1 time? After giving her sister TWO YEARS of 1:1 time? Of course she's jealous! You effectively told her that her sister is significantly more important than her. It will take years to repair your relationship, if there's any hope that it ever will be repaired. And going out to eat 1:1 once won't fix it. You really need to do something with her 1:1 at least weekly if you hope to matter in her life, to tell her you care about her at all, to undo the damage of abandoning her for TWO YEARS.\n\nAnd don't be surprised that it takes hard work and intentionality to connect to her. Of course she wants to be on the phone when around you. You're a complete stranger at this point who stabbed her in the back emotionally. You need to put serious work into your relationship before she values time with you. And that's on you, not her. Don't blame her for guarding herself against being hurt by you again.\n\nYTA. As a medical mom, I can't believe you're using your daughter's diagnosis to defend yourself. It's unfair to both your daughters. Congratulations on guaranteeing they'll never like each other.", "And based on the edit, she never will. OP is going to be wondering why Jenny is NC very soon.", "Yeah, I'm sure Tara could also use some alone time to just be a teenager and do teenager stuff, without her mom hovering over her and trying to micromanage her life.  She also missed two years of normal teenage stuff, and being infantilized by her mom won't help.", "It\u2019s very codependent. Not saying it\u2019ll happen but that\u2019s how people start getting into", "Makes you wonder what she was even in hospital for that had her teetering on the edge between dying any second so op couldn't possibly leave to actually parent her other child, and living a normal life after recovery that takes two years.", "Exactly. It takes about 2 years at that age. Without Covid. Depending on where she lives she might have barely made friends.", "They should just send her back.", "Yeah. I just now saw the edit. \n\nOP I agree dont neglect Tara. But do def give Jenny attention and time. \n\nIf you are worried your husband is Neglecting Tara then yall should do the same -vice versa. \nAsk him to go out with Tara to dinner but on a diff night than you and Jenny go out the first few times.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nBut def keep your relationship with Tara strong! It's good that's there and that your husband is close to Jenny. Keep those maintained while building new!", "I feel you so much with this and am so sorry you had to go through this. For me it was my father who was severely ill not a sibling.  But I was expected to switch between being an adult and my mother's partner and her obedient little child whenever it suited her.  When I'm unhappy about something I'm just a child who needs to shut up and do as she's told but when she needs support visiting lawyers or running the family business then 13 year old me was a great surrogate husband.\n\nBut hey, I had it easy right?  My father was severly disabled and she was \"keeping everything together\" so who thinks of the kid in the background.  To this day my mother has never acknowledged how that period of my life affected me.", "My son had a friend who had two younger siblings, both with serious disabilities. He would come over to our house and regale us with stories of his terrible luck- how he drank from a water fountain and it got all over his pants so everyone thought he\u2019d wet himself. How he fell off his bike and was so dizzy he couldn\u2019t get back on, but his mother didn\u2019t believe he had a concussion. He would pick really small things, or exaggerat big things, and it was so funny, we\u2019d all be rolling at our normally *too quiet* dinner table.\n\nI always felt bad for him, though. I knew he enjoyed the attention his tales of woe got at our house. And I understood that his Mom was overwhelmed with the her other kids special needs that she needed *him* to *not have any needs, ever*.", "Seriously, she thinks Jenny is demanding Tara be neglected (which i don\u2019t think is the case)\u2026but then she validated neglecting Jenny through Tara\u2019s sickness\u2026like wut?", "My sister and my father both had(/have) serious medical issues, so I have experienced a lot of what's being talked about here. I never knew there was a name for it.", "It's not really just sending her away that's the problem. It's sending her away and expecting her to act like nothing ever happened.\n\nThe pet comparison makes it worse for sure. Even if this was a pet dog you shouldn't expect the dog after 2 years of being abandoned to love you the same way it did before you left?? I wouldn't even expect the dog to recognize me tbh. Never mind getting mad at the dog for daring to like the other owner more (the dad in this terrible pet analogy)", "And in that way, it indicates OP\u2019s focus is herself \u2014 whether or not she\u2019s guilty \u2014 as opposed to her daughter\u2019s needs.", "This! This is it. OP YTA. I'm a mother. No one is saying that you had to neglect your sick child, but you have two daughters. You need to see a therapist to get some feedback as to how to fix this.", "I'm so sorry you went through all of that and for the loss of your son, but it really sounds like you did everything in your power to keep your family together, your children are lucky to have you. \n\nYTA, OP.", "100%. Sounds like OP doesn't really want to spend time with Jenny. She talks about what Tara needs, how poor Tara is, how Tara needs to be included. Has she ever even spend time with Jenny 1:1? I doubt it\n\nThis was a chance to do that, and she blew it. For a \"girls night\". Where Tara would've been the focus, again.", "In the back of her head, Jenny wants to get sick or injured, ti see *if* her parents will show up.", "Agreed. I used to tutor kids in the hospital. My favorite family had a child with CF and another child. CF child was in the hospital a lot as very prone to infections. Dad worked his ass off too and then was with non CF child or in hospital. Mom ran back and forth. As she and I got close, she would leave when I was tutoring to be with other child. \n\nBeing there was important as med were messed up more than once and mom was very vigilant to make sure that never happened again.\n\nAlso CF child was Ok with some alone time. The family was very close. CF child was understanding that sibling needed mom too and non CF child was a rockstar. Parents were both devoted to both kids.", "OP probably didn't include those details because she probably never bothered to ask Jenny how things went.\n\nIt could have been fine, it could have been awful, OP doesn't seem like the type to notice or care either way.", "I've seen this kind of thing before in the support groups I've attended. Parents will sometimes come to resent the \"healthy\" child for having any needs at all, especially if the parent has had to care for a sick child long-term. People don't always react in a rational way to trauma, I guess.", "Exactly! I understand where OP was coming from but that 'edit' really screwed it up....the biggest issue for me was the point where OP brings Tara along so that she has someone to talk to because she knows Jenny will be on the phone. WTF?!!! what kind of parent attitude is that? how is OP trying to mend her relationship with Jenny when she's already given up on her?", "Thing that gets me is does it take two parents every hour of every day to be there for Tara, but not Jenny?   Surely one of the parents could have given Jenny time every week. One of them could give her a few hours.", "My reading of it is OP saying that the dad \u201cneglected\u201dTara, but he was working two jobs to pay for the health costs? Did the dad visit Jenny? Because Jenny seems fine with her dad.", "I feel that's seems likely because it's the most well known thing tbh. It can really be a ton of things.\n\nBut yea. I'm wondering how much of the bullying is just standing up for herself", "But if she did that, how could she be at the hospital showing everyone how wonderful of a parent she was to never leave her poor sick child.", "Seems like dad put in the time at least afterward, but I'm getting the sense that OP's husband maybe went out to visit based on some comments?", "I put my mother thru some shit. My kids put me thru less shit, but still some shit. I can't imagine a mom talking about her daughter like this. Sooooo hurtful. You're right, she doesn't get it. Hopefully Jenny goes back to Gmas, gets some therapy and let's this relationship go.", "Guarantee for the rest of Tara\u2019s life, OP will he doing the my poor baby thing. My MIL\u2019s sister does this with her son who had cancer at 21 and is now 55."]}
