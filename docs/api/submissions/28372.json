Have never been to any sushi restaurant there or in any country that doesn\u2019t have cooked food. There\u2019s also a wide variety of maki and nigiri that have cooked ingredients. I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t read the menu?", "I'd like to know where this Japanese restaurant that has literally nothing but raw seafood is.", "Have you looked at the menu online?  I'm a huge fan of sushi and eat it in every city I go to.  Every single Japanese restaurant has teriyaki chicken, rice, cooked fish, miso soup, vegetarian sushi (which is delish), fun appetizers, hot pot soups, etc.", "INFO: Did you really check the menu? Most Japanese restaurants offer at least some Tempura (fried in batter) dishes like chicken or veggies. Did you check the appetizer or kids menus to see if there was anything there you could eat?", "Info- so there was no seaweed salad, veggie roll, etc?", "Hm, most Japanese places have non-raw options, like shrimp, surimi, unagi(eel), omelette etc. Was it not the case here...? NTA for not eating, it's just really strange if they had no other option.", "There was no tempura option? Japanese is not all raw fish, so it seems like you didn't read the menu", "I hate all fish and seafood and I've never been unable to find something I can eat at a Japanese place, there's always at least tempura veggies and some random beef or chicken dish or a no -fish soup.\n\nSo N T A if they really truly had nothing but raw fish but Y T A because I'm assuming that wasn't actually the case based on personal experience.", "YTA - There is tempura, California rolls, tiger rolls etc. Not only will there be cooked dishes, but there\u2019s sushi without raw fish.", "Most of the popular sushi options are cooked. California Rolls (pollock/real crab, avocado, cucumber/rice/seaweed). Teriyaki Roll (some form of teriyaki chicken or beef rolled in with avocado/rice/seaweed.) Dynamite Roll (tempura shrimp/avocado/rice/seaweed). There are always vegan options at a sushi restaurant (kappa (cucumber), tomago (egg), yam, avocado), and that's just talking about SUSHI. Most Japanese places also have bento and tempura and teriyaki. It sounds like you just wanted to go somewhere else, sulked about the choice, and didn't bother finding anything you could eat on the menu. The assumption that all sushi is raw fish is just factually incorrect. And I LIKE raw fish/sushi, but a lot of what I get isn't raw. \n\nI have an allergy. It's peppers. All peppers. Do you know how hard it is for me to go to places and eat things that don't have peppers mixed in? Especially unwarned for, since most places don't consider peppers a common enough allergen to warn for? So I have to ask, double ask, then sometimes, ask for a replacement because the server or chef was incorrect? But I will attempt to find SOMETHING on the menu I can eat, even with an allergy and intolerances and things I don't like. I hate cucumber. I ask for sushi rolls without it. I hate eggs, so no custards, crepes, french toast, tamago for me. But if you actually take a minute instead of sulking, you can find SOMETHING on the menu you can eat. You just wanted to win the suffering olympics. YTA.", "[removed]", "NTA if they really had nothing else, but I have never in my life seen an only-sushi place.

My parents, father mainly, shunned raw fish and in fact steak that wasn't well done.

I'd probably just walk out and catch a bus home.", "No I hate fish", "NTA. Your Mum knew you couldn't eat anything on the menu. That was unfair.

Sorry you had to go through all that.", "You might want to look into ARFID. ARFID is a sensory processing issue in which the sensory qualities of the food can cause extreme physical reactions. So, it wouldn't be a physical allergy reaction, but instead the \"fishy\" flavor or the texture of the fish causing problems. Do you have other symptoms that might point to sensory processing issues? E.g. strong sensitivity to bright light, loud sounds, or the texture of clothing; or having trouble parsing what people are saying when there's only moderate background noise.\n\nIt's also possible to have a food sensitivity that isn't an allergy-- there are blood tests for food sensitivities these days. However, sensitivities don't normally take effect *immediately*; they're more chronic, and often kick in a few hours later, or only in combination with a number of triggering foods, or only when eaten in large enough quantities.\n\nAnother possibility is that you at one point had a bad physical reaction to fish (such as a case of bad food poisoning), and your brain decided to classify fish as no longer edible to you. The psychological effects of having food poisoning once can be surprisingly lasting and intense, and ruin the offending food (or even just food that you *associate* with the experience, even if it's not what got you sick) for years afterwards. Maybe as a kid you got food poisoning, associated it with fish, and your brain was like \"welp, that's set in stone now, never forgetting this.\" Which can happen!\n\nEdit to add: And yet another possibility is that you do have an allergy and the test just didn't catch it. Foods have lots of different proteins and other compounds in them-- they're not necessarily all one \"thing.\" For example, potato skins have much more solanine in them than the flesh of the potato, so if you're sensitive to solanine specifically, your results will look different if you're reacting to the skin vs. the flesh. AFAIK some allergy tests might only test for particular proteins, so you might be allergic to a *different* compound in fish than the one they tested for. Or the test just might have failed for some reason.", "This is also me. I'm not allergic but i get sick from it. \n\nLuckily for me I also find the taste awful so this isn't really a negative for me.", "NTA for all the reasons cited numerous times.\n\nBut you really have to answer the question being raised by many: did they really have NOTHING you'd find edible on the menu.  That's very strange.  On the other hand, although you didn't say it, maybe the smell of a primarily-seafood establishment is something you find obnoxious and would ruin your appetite.
