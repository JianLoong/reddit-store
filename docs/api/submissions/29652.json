And I already pay for most of the stuff we do together.\n\nHe got red and yelled that it\u2019s not *my* money, so I shouldn\u2019t care.\n\nI snapped at him that it is my money, it\u2019s from my family and If he wants some extra than he should find work.\n\nHe stormed off and hasn\u2019t talked to me since, I know it wasn\u2019t fair for me to say it since between his basketball, studying and having a social life he doesn\u2019t have that much time.\n\nI feel really bad now but I also don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, I shouldn\u2019t have to give him money just because he\u2019s my boyfriend.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698238163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g3zxf/aita_for_not_telling_my_boyfriend_my_family_is/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Boyfriend sounds super greedy. This is a huge red flag here, hun", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely not something he should be getting red in the face and yelling about. It IS your money. If he needs financial help, then it\u2019s not something he should pressure you for. He could always talk to his own family about increasing the amount he gets if it\u2019s really that bad. You\u2019re not being selfish at all here, and it\u2019s the smart thing to stand up for yourself and keep your money safe.", "NTA  Your financial status is not your boyfriend's business.  It is astounding that he thinks that just because you are dating you should give him your money.  He sounds like an entitled, selfish and immature young man.  This does not sound like a healthy relationship for you and would be a good time to cut him loose.", "NTA. You're not married and, in the grand scheme of things, you haven't even been dating this guy all that long. The fact that he should feel so entitled to MORE of your money (since you say you pay for most of the things you do together) is a huge red flag. You may want to really examine this relationships and see if its healthy and truly worth it.", "NTA and dump him.  Yelling at you about this and his reasoning is major red flags", "NTA. He is entitled and immature.", "NTA and it was absolutely fair to say that to him. You do not have to tell him about your money and you definitely do not have to share it with him. No no no no no. Do NoT apologize. Dump him. His behavior crosses a line and it deeply concerns me that you\u2019ve been dating less than a year and he feels entitled to your money and your financial info. No no no.", "NTA\n\nHe is not entitled to your money! You already pay for majority of the stuff in the relationship. Maybe he should start saving.", "Omg NTA but run girl run!", "You are NTA, but your sponger boyfriend certainly is.", "nta.\n\nboyfriend does not understand he is not husband therefore is not entitle to money as such. You should reconsider relationship with him after that.", "he really should have told you before that he was a sugar baby. nta.", "NTA he's your boyfriend, not you fiance nor your husband, he sould manage his expenses for himself, as you do for yours.", "NTA. my son is a 21 year old college student. We pay his tuition and bigger expenses like car insurance and books. Everything else is on him. He lives off campus with friends and pays rent utilities and food. He has a job a girlfriend and 16 credit hour load of studying and never once has he asked for extra money or tried to mooch off his friends or girlfriend.", "You're NTA in this situation. Your family provides you with financial support, and you're under no obligation to share that money with your boyfriend unless you willingly choose to do so. Your boyfriend's reaction was unreasonable, and his expectation that you should give him your family's money is not fair or justified.", "NTA. Dating someone doesn't automatically mean that all your assets are his. (Hell, even *marrying* someone doesn't mean that for everything.) Politely asking for money is fine as long as it's not too often or for more than you can afford, but *demanding* it? And throwing a tantrum when you said no? Fucking yikes, dude.", "NTA. Do not give him your parents money. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s for. It would really be a shitty thing to do to them. \nHe can ask him family for more. Or\u2026. Get. A. Job.", "NTA \n\nAlthough, the excuse you gave for your boyfriend not having a job is basketball, understandable. Studying, also understandable. A social life, not understandable. Unfortunately, he needs to learn now while he is still in college, that a social life is extra. If he needs money, he needs to work at least part-time and not expect his girlfriend, who works, to pick up his slack. Having a social life is great, but he needs to weigh whether having a social life is better than not having money. You are not obligated to use your money to help him. If you choose to, that's awesome, but you don't have to. He is really acting like a child that's not getting his way.", "Nta, he is not.entitled to your money. The only reason I could think that he has a right to be kind of angry is when he is suffering (skipping.meals, not having meds due to cost, etc.), you knew about it and didn't offer to make or buy him some extra food or something. Because I wouldn't want my boyfriend to suffer when I can help with some simple groceries", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA.\n\nHowever, consider this, due to your current choices, your parents are effectively paying for another family's child when they want to support *you*. Is that fair to them?", "NTA but I\u2019d seriously be reconsidering this relationship.", "NTA rethink the relationship. You're not obligated to give him money and he shouldn't try and guilt you. It's really simple to ask your partner if you need help. It's your money and you should fall back from the relationship.", "NTA. He\u2019s got a lot of red flags.", "NTA. You're bfs a mooch.", "NTA. He's already trying to mooch and y'all aren't even out of college.", "NTA. This is your family's money. Don't exploit their generosity. Being supported like this as an adult is a privilege, not a right. \n\nHe's looking at you with dollar signs in his eyes.", "NTA and he's VERY entitled to think you should give him some of YOUR money. WTF. Sure, its nice if you pay for stuff when you go out, but that's about it.\n\nI had friends in college who got money from their parents, so they didn't have to work, OR worry about money. Me? I was always broke, and was only able to work sporadically. My parents would sometimes help me out, but not regularly. It never occurred to me to ask my friends to give me money!", "NTA but your boyfriend is. You were right for snapping at him about him getting a job since he wants money. Emphasis on the word 'wants'. He doesn't need it, he has his necessities covered.", "NTA. It\u2019s your money because your family gave it to you. You aren\u2019t obligated to give him any of it just because the two of your are dating. If he wants more spending money he needs to figure out how to bring in more money, working around basketball might be difficult but cutting back on socializing wouldn\u2019t kill him. He sounds greedy.", "NTA but your boyfriend is. You were right for snapping at him about him getting a job since he wants money. Emphasis on the word 'wants'. He doesn't need it, he has his necessities covered.\n\nIt is also in fact your money.

That last line says it all. Just because he is your boyfriend does not mean you are in any obligation to be giving him any of your money. I am guessing you pay for majority of things when you guys go out together. If that makes you happy, I see nothing wrong with that but I suggest limiting back on it after the way he display his anger toward you for not sharing your money with him.", "NTA\n\nYour money is none of his business.", "NTA but OP\u2019s bf sure did show his true colours. He sounded like a gold digger.", "Definitely NTA. Your money is yours. You already pay for most of what you do with him, and you shouldn\u2019t have to do that.

The entitled one.\n\nYou can do better.", "NTA.\n\nHe's your boyfriend, but he isn't a spouse or even a very long term partner. He's not entitled to anything you have and he can't expect you and your parents to subsidize his lifestyle. If he's expecting you to pay for him all the time, he's way out of line. If he's having financial difficulties, he should speak to his coach about possible additional scholarship money or even work study opportunities through the school.\n\nI would caution you to start being more careful with your spending. While it's kind of you to help out your friends, please don't dismiss that things are financially difficult for a lot of people right now all around. It would behoove you to do more saving than spending, even while you're in school. It's great that you don't have to worry about funding, but circumstances do change.\n\nAlso, don't disclose your family's financial situation. It's no one's business.", "NTA, boyfriend got way too mad and was the selfish one.", "NTA. dump him.", ">He stormed off and hasn\u2019t talked to me since\n\nTrash has taken itself out.
