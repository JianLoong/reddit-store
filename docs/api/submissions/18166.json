There are floaters to cover breaks, if we have to go to the bathroom, etc. Most are great, but there\u2019s one, \u201cAnne\u201d (in her 50s) who is not very considerate at naptime. If she comes in to cover a break or for one of us to pee, she talks loudly and ultimately wakes up some of the kids. I\u2019ve tried talking to her about it but she claims she isn\u2019t loud at all. I spoke to the directors and they brought it up in a staff meeting because it was a common compliant for not just Anne, but another floater. The other improved but Anne didn\u2019t.\n\nYesterday, she came in my room to give a bathroom break. She then lingered in our room after my assistant, \u201cMay\u201d came back as she had nowhere to be and is friends with her. May was speaking quietly but Anne was being very loud. 2 kids woke up. I gently shushed her and she asked loudly \u201cwhy are you shushing me?\u201d I said because she\u2019s being loud and waking up kids. She said they only had 30 minutes left in nap and some were already awake. I said yeah but I want the rest to stay asleep. She got quiet for a bit. \n\nIt was raining outside and it really picked up. Anne asked loudly if it was raining a few times. We had the blinds drawn as it was nap. I whispered I think so. She then walked over to the sound machine we keep on, proclaiming \u201cI want to hear the rain\u201d. She shut it off and 3 kids who need that machine to sleep shot up on their cots.\n\nI told her \u201cthat\u2019s enough. Get out\u201d. She got very offended and said I can\u2019t kick her out. I said it was my room and I absolutely could. I told her she had no right to touch our property and interrupt nap. She refused to leave. I called a director who came down and made her leave to avoid drama.\n\nToday, I got called into a meeting that Anne called. She accused me of being rude and said she felt \u201cunwelcome\u201d. My bosses asked me to apologize but I wouldn\u2019t. I said she is very rude and disruptive. The solution is that Anne will no longer come in my room, barring there is no one else in who can. \n\nSome people at work think I was rude and that I had no right to kick her out of my room.

Pretty sure letting the kids sleep at naptime is her freaking job.", "She may be going deaf, and isn\u2019t aware that she\u2019s talking loudly (my dad does this). Would also explain shutting off the noise machine if she can\u2019t hear well with the background noise. \n\nAbsolutely none of that is any excuse for her behaviour. You\u2019re NTA and I hope you talk privately to your management to ask for an apology from her rather than being bullied into giving one.", "Definitely NTA. And your boss clearly agrees, as when they attempted to placate Anne by requesting an apology, you refused and walked away with everything you wanted, while Anne walked away with nothing but a bruised ego.\n\nAlso I hate when bosses try to deescalate a problem between two employees by asking for an apology where none is warranted. Many years ago a boss pulled me into his office because a coworker had complained that I was rude to her. I gave the boss my side of the story, which he believed because he was a constant witness of her behavior. He asked if I would apologize to her anyway simply to make the matter go away. I told him of course, if she also apologized to me at the same time. We both knew she never would. So my boss looked at me and said \"never mind.\" And that was the end of that.", "NTA\n\nAs the father of a 3yo, I can confirm that there is nothing more unforgivable than waking a sleeping toddler.", "NTA. She was unwelcome as you put it as she loud, disruptive and rude. She's also, I'm guessing, partly deaf and doesn't realise how loud she is. But mainly she's inconsiderate.", "NTA.  Anne may need her hearing checked...... or her entitlement.", "NTA. \n\n1. She didn't belong in the room at all.\n2. Regardless of what she thought, the teacher is telling her she it too loud. She didn't respect you or what you do.\n3. She obviously doesn't understand the mission of a school is centered around the children and not her desire to hear the rain.\n4. She cause real disruption not only in her volume but esp. in turning off the sound machine.\n\nI do think she may have hearing loss and that may be why she doesn't thik she's loud. Still, not on you to approach her on that - simply what she did and its effect on the kids.\n\nGood for you!", "NTA. Seems like quite a win that she doesn't want to come into your room anymore.", "NTA I think you described it well. It all sounds believable. I think it was appropriate.", "NTA \n\nI used to be a preschool/daycare teacher and you absolutely did the right thing. She\u2019s been asked to be quieter by others and you and then she has the balls to turn off the dang sleep machine? Does she know how much these kids need it? Sooo not ok. \n\nPlus y\u2019all need nap time to last as long as it can given the chaos of toddles lol.", "NTA\n\nAnne is inconsiderate and inept but for some reason the director keeps her employed. \n\nTry to keep her out of your room during naptime. \n\nIf possible, post rules about who is allowed to touch the noise machine and chatting during naptime.", "NTA. I'm not sure why you need this explained to you. Your responsibility is to the children and their well being. Not Anne's need to hear the rain. She can go outside if she does.", "NTA. I work at a preschool and would have kicked her out also.", "NTA: Nap-time is so important and her jabbering away waking up those kids is so rude. As soon as you told her she was being too loud she should have checked herself. You were completely in the right especially as the head teacher and her being a floater.", "NTA. Anne doesn't seem to actually like the kids or care that she is disturbing them. Don't let her in your room during nap time again.", "NTA   I wonder if Anne needs a hearing assessment.  She at least needs barred from rooms during nap time.", "As a person that has worked with children for 7 years in daycare facilities and I'm a lead teacher in a 2 year old room. (I used to be a lead teacher for a classroom of one year old students for 2 years.) \n\nYou were not in the wrong at all, it is rude and disrespectful to you, your students, and your coteacher. Nap time is quite time, period. Teachers should be able to do things quickly in the classroom while students get that much needed two hours of sleep. Many of my students get up at the crack of dawn, and need those 2 hours of Naptime to be able to function and participate in activities for the rest of the day. \n\nYou have every right to claim that a floater can't go into your classroom, for it is your classroom and you have final say for the sake of your students. You are NOT the a**hole.", "NTA; I do think you were rude, but only after giving her more than enough fair warning for her own rudeness. She\u2019s not the one who has to deal with those kids after they have not had a good nap, you are. If she felt unwelcome, maybe she she shoulda considered that it was how loud she was being that was unwelcome. I don\u2019t know how else you could have handled it, though I am not a lead teacher at a daycare obviously.\n\nYou were rude because there were limits to what you could have done in this situation. You did the right thing, I think. Hopefully if she can be quieter and more respectful of her position, then she can be welcomed back.", "ESH\n\nAnd, Anne sucks more than you.\n\nBut, you were unprofessional.

We gave up guns and the wild wild west (well, some of us did) to live in actual societies.  So, we have to deal with assholes all day.  Anne was an asshole.  But you should have dealt firmly--but professionally--with this, a long time ago.\n\nYou don't snap in the middle of a session.  You record it, you gather evidence, you can even talk to parents to get them on your side (I know I'd be happy to kick out some aide who was waking up the kids; naps are important for kids and everyone else's sanity).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Waking multiple children half an hour before end of nap time is asking for trouble. Pity is, as a floater she isn't guaranteed to be the one dealing with the trouble arising from so many toddlers upset and grumpy because they needed more sleep.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly I'm surprised she didn't get fired for that, especially as this is apparently an ongoing issue for her.", "NTA. And it's time for Anne to get hearing aids!", "I wonder if Anne is suffering from hearing loss.  I have a friend who never realizes how loud she's talking until she's shushed, and partial hearing loss (not to mention a lack of self-awareness) is part of the problem.  Regardless, NTA.", "NTA She felt unwelcomed, because she was \ud83d\ude05", "NTA in the slightest. \n\nAny parent of a kid who didn\u2019t get their whole nap because of an obnoxious staff member would be pissed off at the facility for allowing this to happen.

You did what you thought you had to do to ensure the children get their proper naptime, but I'm having a hard time believing that Anne is doing this intentionally or knowingly. It really sounds like she's got a hearing problem. \n\nAll that said, I'm not giving an official N S H until I get some info from you: was the sound of the rain obvious to you? Was she really straining to hear it? If so, that might be an unofficial hearing test right there confirming my wild speculation. \n\nIf her hearing is fine and she really is being callous, you're definitely N T A. You could have handled a lot better and with much more professionalism that would have been more effective in taking care of Anne, but N T A none the less. \n\nBack to my original question: Was the sound of the rain loud enough to be obvious?", "I'm naturally loud, like, I'm the loudest person I or anybody I know, knows. My wife is a daycare lead teacher. When I've had to go to drop off lunch, pick something up, etc.... I would show up at nap, walk in, and talk quietly. It's not that hard.", "NTA she\u2019s clearly not fit for this job, so what does she have on the director that she hasn\u2019t been fired or severely reprimanded by now?", "No one is naturally loud unless they are a braying ass so donkeys shouldn't be in preschools.", "NTA.. she either self awareness or is just being wild on purpose", "NTA. This woman knows exactly what she\u2019s doing.", "NTA - I work with children as well, if someone came in and behaved like her I absolutely would have reacted the same way as you. She\u2019s selfish and apparently lacks the self awareness to work in that environment. Her wants don\u2019t trump the needs of the children.

I suggested in the meeting then perhaps she just shouldn\u2019t talk when in the room, as it\u2019s naptime, and she acted like I slapped her or something.", "Some people just have to talk and talk loudly. I was asleep sick on a couch one time and my brother's MIL came early to meet her daughter (this was all at my parents house where all the kids were often) and since I was sleeping she had a screamingly loud conversation with the dog for like twenty minutes.", "They said they don\u2019t agree with her behavior but also said that we only have so many floaters and are worried she\u2019ll quit.", "If she\u2019s naturally loud then she needs to make a concerted effort to be artificially quiet. \n\nThe nap time isn\u2019t just for the kids schedule, it\u2019s so the employees can have a slower pace of work for a part of the day. Full on caring for a room full of high energy but also tired and cranky toddlers would have anyone pushed to the edge of sanity. They wouldn\u2019t be able to keep employees from quitting.\n\nSo if she won\u2019t learn to be quiet she\u2019s not suitable for the job.", "Well, yes that is the solution. \n\nAlthough how does a 50 year old not know how to whisper? Even children understand indoor voices. And indoor voices are not loud enough to be heard across the room.", "Is there a chance she is losing her hearing? Both my In laws are hard of hearing (and refuse to get hearing aids) and the volume of their conversations is obnoxiously loud.\n\nStill NTA...the kids welfare is your top concern.", "I would say that I am naturally loud. This does not mean that I can\u2019t be, or won\u2019t be, quiet or indeed silent.", "That's ridiculous. \n\nThey need to do better in recruiting better people.\n\nLetting her disrupt the kids in nap time is not ok just because they can't be bothered to recruit better people.", "NTA. I would be pissed and annoyed with her. Could she maybe only work with children who are old enough to not need naps?", "A sad and common problem at daycares in the US these days.  My sister works at one, and the stories she tells me about what her coworkers get away with... they can't fire them because then they won't make class ratios.", "Unfortunately, all rooms nap. Not all kids take them but every room has at least a handful that sleep."]}
