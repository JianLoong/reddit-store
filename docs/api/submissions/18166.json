And your boss clearly agrees, as when they attempted to placate Anne by requesting an apology, you refused and walked away with everything you wanted, while Anne walked away with nothing but a bruised ego.\n\nAlso I hate when bosses try to deescalate a problem between two employees by asking for an apology where none is warranted. Many years ago a boss pulled me into his office because a coworker had complained that I was rude to her. I gave the boss my side of the story, which he believed because he was a constant witness of her behavior. He asked if I would apologize to her anyway simply to make the matter go away.

Nap time is quite time, period. Teachers should be able to do things quickly in the classroom while students get that much needed two hours of sleep. Many of my students get up at the crack of dawn, and need those 2 hours of Naptime to be able to function and participate in activities for the rest of the day. \n\nYou have every right to claim that a floater can't go into your classroom, for it is your classroom and you have final say for the sake of your students.

I don\u2019t know how else you could have handled it, though I am not a lead teacher at a daycare obviously.\n\nYou were rude because there were limits to what you could have done in this situation.
