Many years ago a boss pulled me into his office because a coworker had complained that I was rude to her. I gave the boss my side of the story, which he believed because he was a constant witness of her behavior. He asked if I would apologize to her anyway simply to make the matter go away.

Worked in the daycare setting for about 7 years. And you bet your behind I have kicked and would definitely kick people out of my room if I deemed it appropriate. I've had those floaters who don't do anything, who do the bare minimum, who think this job is \"just babysitting\", and yes, definitely those floaters who think nap time is just a suggestion and that they can be loud during those precious few hours that the kids need to rest and we need to plan/clean/do whatever to have the day run smooth. I would have gone feral if she touched my sound machine, I tell you what. \nI wouldn't mind the coworkers who say you were wrong. Tell them that they can have that floater during nap time then if they don't think she's an issue or too loud. And I get that we're in a teacher shortage, what with the pay being bad and burnout being worse (it's why I'm taking a break from childcare right now!) But your director should be more worried about losing you, in my opinion. Not that it's necessarily a pick a side battle, but they shouldn't try to force you to apologize for something you had every right to do. You're lead teacher. You run the room. She was being disruptive. She woke up your kids. She's gone. End of story. She wants to be back with the toddlers? (Best age group btw) tell her to learn how to use her inside voice.", "NTA. Who shuts of the sound machine when kids are sleeping?  Sorry she complained to the Admin; she is either malicious or out of touch. And good on you for standing your ground and not apologizing. I hope the school Admin realizes you are advocating for the kids.", "Have you ever considered that Anne has hearing loss, which is not that uncommon for people her age? She may not be able to hear how loudly she speaks.", "NTA. Kids come first. You\u2019re their room leader, it\u2019s your job to make sure that happens. You made her feel unwelcome because she was unwelcome", "NTA\n\nIf there\u2019s any doubt, tell this story to the parents. They\u2019ll have your back on this so fast it will make your head spin.", "Used to drive me nuts when the floaters would be inconsiderate!!", "As a naturally loud childcare worker myself, I say very firmly NTA. Holy shit, it\u2019s not hard to keep your voice down and not press buttons on the sound machine during naptime.  And if Anne can\u2019t do that then I think she should be the one to deal with the kids until after nap. She can have fun keeping all the kids who are awake on their cots while you\u2019re out of the room to maintain ratio. She\u2019s a huge A H and probably shouldn\u2019t be working in childcare.", " NTA", "NTA. She was warned numerous times.", "NTA If she wants to hear the rain she can go stand outside smh", "NTA!  \nGood for you that you stood your ground!", "NTA at all but she is. She is a grown ass woman and can definitely learn self control, she just doesn't want to. My angsty 13 year old brother has better self control. You're the teacher and it's your right to ask anyone who is disrupting your kids' schedule, to leave the classroom.", "Floater here \ud83d\udc4b this lady is downright rude. It's common sense and basic decency to try to be quiet when ANYONE is sleeping. NTA, I'm honestly surprised someone else hasn't snapped sooner.", "NTA\n\nKids have a hard time learning to be considerate without an actively bad example at day care.", "NTA the people at work who are complaining are just mad that it upped the chance of her being in their room during nap time", "NTA\n\n\nAnne prioritized her **wants** over the kids' **needs**. It sounds like she was literally doing the opposite of her job! \n\n\nIt sounds like she has a developing hearing problem that she's unaware of and/or in denial about, but that's her problem, not yours, and certainly not the kids'!", "> Who the fuck tries to wake up napping children on purpose?\n\nMain character syndrome isn't just something for the kids", "If she's naturally loud, maybe she should consider looking for a job at a senior facility.

I *know* it, I *accept* it annnnnnnnd.....\n\nWait for it\n\nI CONTROL it. I work in an area that being too loud is very bad (HIPAA), and I have 0 issue with it, because as I grew I stopped talking offense to being told I was loud and actually *accepted* it about myself. Big step toward control is actually acknowledging the problem, not making excuses. \n\n She could control it too if she actuality accepted it about herself rather than taking offense to it. She holds herself back.\n\nNTA. You were right to care more about the kids than her feelings being hurt over her own rudeness.\n\nEdit to add; re-evaluating the age... maybe she's in denial over some hearing loss or has the start of tinnitus (happens during hearing loss) and is talking over the buzz? Still not appropriate for her to continually act against the multiple people saying she's loud but...offers a better explanation than her simply being that AH.", "Sounds like she is deaf. Does she need to be a let to hear for her job?", "Unfortunately this has built Anne\u2019s  entitled attitude, where she disrupts your room repeatedly and tells you you\u2019re not in charge when you are. She\u2019s acting like she\u2019s unfirerable and will likely get worse. They have to be willing to let someone go who\u2019s being so terrible; if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll lose the good staff who will quit because they can\u2019t stand dealing with her. They\u2019ll also lose clients when the parents find out the poor care of their children she\u2019s causing. But I know I don\u2019t have to tell you this; are there opportunities for you to tell your bosses?", "Would they rather have teachers quit because they let floaters do as the please? I have been there! I am a toddler teacher as well and have had my fair share of floaters that I did not care for. Most of which were during nap time when they would I do things that woke up kids. I understand your frustration and you are definitely NTA", "I was wondering about the autistic possibility too, my friends older children have absolutely no volume button, no matter how many times you try to correct them. We assume autism = children, but the amount of undiagnosed autistic adults must be legion at this point.", "I have a sister who is naturally loud. Even her whisper is loud. She does not understand the concept of quiet. Her voice is always the loudest in the room. Except when our aunt is over.

As a result, my base default is loud and I have to constantly check my volume.", "Like people with ADHD can have difficulty controlling volume over the course of a conversation, but if attention is brought to our volume, will immediately whisper. Like... I even whisper when I know my mum's asleep. It's just polite.
