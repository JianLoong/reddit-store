How you live is one of the most important things you two can decide on, along with having children and financial arrangements. \n\nJust as two people shouldn't be together if one wants children and the other doesn't, if it is a \"dealbreaker\" for him to want to live with his family and you don't want to, well then you shouldn't get married. No one is right or wrong, just like no one is right or wrong for wanting or not wanting children. \n\nI would say no one is the asshole, but your fiance says marriage is about compromise, but where is his compromise on the issue? Him continuing to pressure and guilt you makes him an AH in this situation. \n\nAnd to answer your other questions- no you don't need to live with HIS family to show love and care. In many families or cultures people live in multi-generational homes, and in many, they do not. A married couple also can only live with one set of parents (well maybe), so cultures and families don't get their own traditions anyway. For example, if one family says the bride moves in with the groom's family and he is marrying a woman whose family always has the groom move in...who wins? Lots of traditions get broken by real life circumstances, is my point. \n\nIf this is the most important thing to him about building a life together, well then he should date women who want that, just as if he wanted 3 kids, he should date women who want that. \n\nI also wouldn't want to live with anyone's parents, including my own (circumstances willing), and that isn't selfish or from a lack of love.

If you think that this is a life you would enjoy, go for it.  But don't be guilted into it.  \"Marriage is about compromises\" should come with \"So we'll have our own house but we'll live at my parents' Friday-Sunday evening.\"   That's a compromise.

Taking care of old people can be a hell lot of work. Old people can get complicated especially in their 80s. You and your BF need to work out a favorable arrangement that adheres to your boundaries.\n\nShe\u2019s your MIL not your mom. The respect she gets is that she is the mother of your son and she is not your biological mom. She has no right to control your life or your choices. I have no right to her life or her choices. \n\nHowever from my personal experience only a few women have been able to adjust to their MIL and FIL mostly because they were treated with love and respect by their MIL and MIL respected that they were married and had a right to their decisions.

You can visit them regularly. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about your BF\u2019s parents and their reception of you so I can\u2019t infer immediately that they are domineering and cruel. I have seen loving MILs and cruel MILs. I would tread on the side of caution and start getting to know your BFs parents more and the family dynamics. Then make the judgement.\n\nSometimes men listen to their mom more than their wife and assume wrong things about them and start mistrusting them which leads to divorce. The nightmare ones I\u2019ve encountered always criticize the bride and not their daughters and are hypocrites. One day the wife got flak from her ex-husband for not cooking the meal like his Mom makes. She took the next bus and divorced him, taking nothing from him not even spousal support. One dude divorced his wife because of her lack of boundaries with her mom. These are some of the examples. The wife in the first example got an awesome MIL in her second marriage. \n\nI\u2019ve seen husband and wife take on a house mortgage and not have the house in their name. So when they were fed up of the crap treatment they had to start all over again from scratch while still stuck paying for a EMI. You can never satisfy a human being, it\u2019s impossible no matter how much you do for them. \n\nWhy does he want you to live with his parents if you are earning? Is there any problem from their end? Is there a rise in housing costs in your city that is making your boyfriend think twice? Is he the only son?\n\nIMO it\u2019s not necessary to live with them to express love and care. You express love and care through your actions and your own will. The love should not be forced.\n\nI need some additional details like your observations and your thoughts on his parents and the current living situation. Why does he want this? \n\nI would rather have you live on your own and have something in your name to fall back on rather living under someone. Your goals don\u2019t matter, you\u2019re contributing to someone else\u2019s goals. If you choose to live with them then you have to give up your goals and compromise. \n\nIt all boils down to what you want. \n\nMoving in to a joint family is a big thing. It\u2019s not only wheather the boy is good, the whole family has to be peaceful and the vibe in the house has to be supportive. If you don\u2019t feel that, then there is no use in moving in. \n\nHere\u2019s one suggestion though, You stay at the dude\u2019s house for a month and he stays at your parent\u2019s house for a month.

Unfortunately, this relationship might not be right for you if he feels so strongly about this. \nI\u2019ll share my situation if it helps. \nA while ago, my mother was in an accident and my mom needed help. I never asked my partner to take care of my mom. For reference, we were in our mid 20s then. But he did agree to take on more of the bills, I cut down work hours and I would drive up to my moms to help her. Again, I never asked my partner to do things for my mom, but there were times where he offered help when thing last became too much for me. \nMy mom got worse, I would NEVER ask for her to move in with us. I ended up moving in with her though because she became disabled and needs full time care. Me and my partner are still going strong and we have been together for six years now. He drives an hour to me so we can spend time together and go on dates, ya know, do couple stuff. Ultimately, he helps with my mom, but I would never ask a partner to be the person who takes care of my parent like your partner is asking you to. And in your situation, it doesn\u2019t even sound like his parents are disabled. From the outside, it sounds like he wants to marry you so that you can take care of him and his parents while he does his thing.

I totally get that multi-generational homes are still common in your culture. But that it is also changing.\n\nAt the same time, in this case, it sounds to go beyond culture to the dynamics and history of his immediate family.\n\nYou mention issues with his brother, their partner and the family. I can make guesses as to what different possibilities are for that could have been. What I will hazard is that whatever actually happened wasn't a one-sided affair. That his family probably contributed their share to the strife as much as the brother and/or his partner did.\n\nWhat you say about it being important to your BF that \"it doesn't repeat so the family can live together happily\" hints at that. It also hints that ome or more someones in his family want to prove that they can live together with a DIL in the household as a \"happy family\". ie. That any previous strife or falling out with the brother and his partner was the fault of the brother/partner.\n\nIf this is even a partial factor here, you absolutely have valid concerns about moving in with or near his family as things stand now. In that scenario, there will be a *lot* of pressure to get along. More than normal. And unless I miss my guess, it will mostly be pressure on you. That others (cough MIL) will behave exactly as they did before, and he'll be pushing hard for you to just put up with it without complaint. Because if they can behave the same as they had previously with their other son and his partner with an appearance of \"happy family\", then obviously it couldn't have been \"their fault\". (yeah right. pull the other one, it's got bells on)\n\nI realize that this is all speculation. But if this is even part of the overall picture, it is a terrible reason to be basing this on. It would be very fair to ask \"how much of your happiness (and his) is he willing to potentially sacrifice for the sake of the happiness of his family?\"\n\nLastly, I find it a little amusing that he's accusing you of not being flexible when what he's asking is for you to live with his family *permanently*. Ok, so he's accomodated you on stuff in the past. Were those things even of the same order of magnitude as what he's asking here? Considering you're not married, I sort of doubt it.

The person before that made a valid point.", "Mansplaining I assume", "It is unnecessary to reply to someone to say the exact same thing!", "it's an India thing, it's expected actually", "Preaching to the choir on that one lol. Its hard finding women Im genuinely compatible with as it is, but throw in no kids and it shrinks that pool a lot more. I know theyre out there but where to meet and form a friendship? Idk. Im an introvert who works from home and dating apps are trash. I meet people and flirt a little and get signs of interest when I *rarely* step out but Im straight up not an easy guy to match with. Its gonna take a real weirdo. Plus yea\u2026.Ive been lied to twice. They assumed id change my mind or be comfortable with happy accidents (that were not accidents they were just trying to get me to go for it in the moment). Trust now takes a long time to earn. Which also makes dating harder! Lol not even mad about it just felt compelled to share. I feel ya buddy. I feel ya.", "Ray was *such* a shitty husband", "No, no, no! The first comment was clearly talking about Oreos dunked in milk. The second one was about those Hydrox imposters. This matters!", "I thought the aggressive one was doing the Reddit bit where people keep commenting the same thing but in different ways", "My favorite moment from that show was a crossover where Rays mom ends up in Dougs house from King of Queen. And she tries to criticize Carries cleaning\u2026and instead of getting mad she plays dumb and and Rays mom ends up cleaning her house and cooking dinner for her. Debra didnt realize she had a free maid with just a little less resistance. Ray is the sitcom worlds worst husband. Gotta be."]}
