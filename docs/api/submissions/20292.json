I think it's fine for you to pay what you had but you mentioned that you all agreed to family style dinners which implies sharing, did you tell everyone at that time that you want to cover just your portion?

If you are not ready to do that, then you're the asshole. Because that shit gets really complicated when people order drinks of different costs in different amounts and different entrees, some people partake in specific apps, some don't. \n\nEveryone doesn't get the exact same stuff, if separate checks aren't possible, you either make do when nothing is crazy out of line or calculate it all by hand.\n\nI organized for my friend a nice dinner celebration and went to a fancy steak restaurant with a large group when I knew everyone wasn't going to necessarily order a nice steak, and I wanted to get what I wanted and not feel bad for forcing anything on the friends that wouldn't. I put my card down to cover the bill, I took a picture of the itemized receipt, sent it to the group, asked people what they each specifically ordered and used the overall % of tax and tip to calculate what their share was for a venmo request. It's a pain but I did it to not inconvenience anyone and be fair. You should be willing to do that if you are gonna be the \"I'll pay my exact share and my exact share only\" guy.", "Why are you going on vacation if you don\u2019t have a job ?", "YTA.

Which to me, also implies sharing the bill.  So, you sort of agreed to this.  \n\nOn the other hand, you \\*did\\* say that you cannot eat what they're having, so it would have been better with stating up front that you'll just pay for your own food.\n\nOn the gripping hand, is it really fair that you pay for everyone else's expensive appetizers when you ordered a cheap one?\n\nMy verdict: \n\n1. you suck a \\*tiny\\* amount, because you weren't clear on your intent to only pay for what you are eating.\n2. they suck much more, because they expect you to pay for their expensive food.", "Communication?! What?! That\u2019s crazy talk\u2026", "They said while planning to order \"Op what are you able to eat?\" And I said \"none of that, I'm going to order myself cauliflower.\" And they continued with their 5 apps. \n\nTo me that indicates that I'm taking care of myself.", "Correction above.  This wasn't dinner.  This was happy hour before my brother finished making dinner.", "Well that doesn't really say much to me. Since you said you all agreed on family style dinners. That was the time you should flagged that you can't eat/share most of the stuff or are on a budget and would prefer to pay your way. I don't think your family/friends would mind you just covering your own share with your job situation. I think just talk to them and tell them.", "Thanks for the context. Probably NTA then! They were being rude by not letting you see the bill.", "They know she cant eat gluten. Why would she ever have to pay for stuff they know she wont eat", "Clarification * this was happy hour.

They know you don\u2019t have money and expect you to pay for their food.  Pfft. No ma\u2019am. Be strong .", "Well, better way of handling such things is to ask for a separate check ahead of time if you not sharing food and not touching shared food.\n\nIf you agree on \u201c family style \u201c you agree on even split of total bill.", "You\u2019re exactly right.  I\u2019ve been in several situations where I had to choose between rent or food.  Thankfully I worked at restaurants so I could have a meal when I was working but on the days I didn\u2019t work (sometimes 2 days in a row), I just wouldn\u2019t eat because I didn\u2019t even have enough for ramen after paying my rent and phone bill.  It\u2019s was terrible.  Absolute NTA.", "Yes, $10 can make or break things sometimes. For waiters too! So why is OP ordering multiple drinks knowing it will short her tip? Was the service really bad enough to tip only 13%? Light ESH. Of course you shouldn't be expected to pay for others, but when money is that tight you need to make sure you can cover yourself.", "As a server - 6 for a 44 dollar tab is reasonable. 8 dollars would have been around a 20% tip, so she tipped around 15% - that's perfectly fine.", "I can't get over being broke but spending 50 on drinks and an app before going to a full dinner.", "No. It\u2019s easier to say to the waiter, I am paying separately.", "No they won\u2019t. They bullied her for the extra $10", "I didn't get that from the post"]}
