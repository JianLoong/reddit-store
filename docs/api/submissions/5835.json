I would visit 1-2 times a month to check in on him, play cards, bring him on walks etc. The main reason for these visits was because when I was at the lowest point in my life after getting home from deployment my grandfather was always there to listen and talk with me. We were both combat veterans so he understood me on a level other people couldn\u2019t. Here is where the problem lies, my grandfather held a lot of extreme viewpoints that I did not agree with, more specifically against the LGBTQ+ community. I resented my grandpa for these views and called him out whenever he would say something inappropriate, I was very close to ending the visits because of these views but decided against it for reasons discussed prior. My sister (28 F) is happily married to a woman (31 F) and therefore obviously cut off contact with my grandfather, my sister and I have a very good relationship in general but would frequently fight over my continued relationship with my grandpa. When he passed away and left me the money I did not think there would be any argument over it as my sister wanted nothing to do with him (understandably so).However when she found out about it she demanded that she should receive half of the money, I was shocked and basically told her no way as she was not the one who had been visiting and providing care for him for the last 5 years. My sister was visibly angry and we have not been on speaking terms since, This has left me wondering wether I am the AH as my sister was a victim of my grandfathers bigotry, however I don\u2019t think half the money is a reasonable request.

Honestly I think YTA if you don\u2019t give her at least a little (but not necessarily half).\n\nLet\u2019s think about this in practical terms - yes you\u2019re the only one that visited, and normally I\u2019d say yes keep it all. But the reason your sister didn\u2019t visit is because she is LGBTQ+, how can you realistically expect her to uphold a relationship with a man that hates who she is? And if he made those comments enough for you to call him out on it, I can\u2019t imagine your sister would have got away unscathed if she had visited.\n\nNo, she doesn\u2019t have the right to demand any money, *technically* it is all yours.

Here\u2019s an interesting thought exercise (just a thought exercise\u2026don\u2019t actually do this). What do you think sister would do if you said you decided to donate half the money to an LGBT org? Would she be happy with that, or would she still demand you give her the money? I suspect the latter.\n\nI am estranged from an abusive relative. If he left me any money I would decline to accept or immediately donate it to a women\u2019s shelter or something. If he left me nothing I would actually be relieved.

I may offer some to keep the peace, as she was subject to bigotry by his words and could offer some consolation for her pain and suffering. However, this is another classic case of \"money tearing families apart\" and it's really up to her if she wants to let greed come between her relationship with her brother. NTA OP, sorry you're in this position. You are every bit entitled to this money.", "NTA. It's your grandfathers last will. Even if he had some questionable Views, it should be respected. I don't blame your sister for resenting your Grandfather and cutting ties with him for that, but demanding half of his money just because they are related is an AH Move for sure.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t deserve anything. She left. That means she gave up on everything to do with him. I get his views were wrong but regardless it was his money and he got to choose what he wanted to do with it. And if she is easily willing to give up on you too over something so fickle then that says a lot about her character", "NTA\n\nYou didn't spend time with him for the money and you also didn't allow him to say bigoted things to you unchecked. \n\nYou had your own, understandable reasons for the connection and your sister gave you a hard time for it while he was living. She showed no empathy for why you needed him in your life because she felt her grievances against him were more important.\n\nIf you cut someone out of your life, no matter how valid your reasons are for doing so, you cannot expect something from them when they're gone.", "Tentive NTA, your sister didn't really have a choice about visiting your grandfather, I mean how could she? He literally hated a part of her and it isn't a lifestyle its who she is, not sure why so many people yourself included are holding this against her.\n\nIt is your money but remember it's only yours because your grandfather literally hated your sister because of something she had no say in.

On the one hand, sis has no claim to the money as she wasn\u2019t there for him. Under normal circumstances I\u2019d call her an AH for expecting you to share. \nOn the other hand, she had very good reason not to be there for him and to feel sort of betrayed by you for supporting him. And considering his views he likely still wouldn\u2019t have given her anything if she had supported him because the real AH in all this is him.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe her anything but you need to accept that the effort on your part didn\u2019t remotely compare to the effort it would\u2019ve been for her to do the same.

We the internet can't judge that but I bet you could if you were honest.  You made an extraordinary effort to provide support to him, and have been rewarded.  If you have good reason to think your sister would have done the same, then maybe you could give her some.  But in my experience it is rare to find anyone going so out of their way as you did.", "NTA. Your sister has no reason to get involved with your grandfather's choice. Don't feel back your doing g nothing wrong. Sorry you are going through this after losing your grandfather.", "Nta and your sister obviously wanted nothing to do with him which was completely warranted.  \ud83d\ude44  . However people always have lots to say when money is involved .", "On the one hand, it was your grandfather's decision and you can honor it. On the other, if you uphold his cutting off your sister you are upholding the same bigotry he supported that drove her away. Self-respect says that's inappropriate (as you say). \n\nHonestly, I would share at least a fifth/quarter with her. It's not completely A H territory, but you will probably lose a relationship with your sister if you share nothing. Is that a consequence you're okay with?", "NAH - I don't think you're an asshole, but I think your sister's request is reasonable and you should split the money.\n\nYour grandfather shunned your sister because of her sexual preferences. She may have wanted to have a relationship with him, but he made it clear that he was unable to accept her. You say that you recognise how awful this was and resented it and nearly ended your visits. But in the end, you did carry on seeing your grandfather for other reasons. Fine.\n\nHad your grandfather not been so bigoted, he would probably have split the inheritance between his grandchildren, but he gave it all to you because he didn't accept your sister. Now, you not sharing the inheritance looks like you are condoning and going along with his non-acceptance of your sister, even though you previously said your grandfather was wrong. It might even send the message that you agree with him. Splitting the money would not only be fairer but would demonstrate to your sister that you care about her.\n\nA 50/50 split would be the simplest way to go. If you find that difficult to stomach due to the hours you spent looking after him in his old age, then an unequal split might work. But if you insist on keeping all the money, then you should accept that it will damage your relationship with your sister forever. Is it worth it?", "NTA. I have no other insight.", "NTA.  Funny how once there\u2019s money involved, relatives come crawling out of the woodwork. Absolutely do not give her half as she\u2019s a hypocrite.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nI hate to say it like this, but your grandfather was raised in a different time. You are allowed to hate something about someone, but still love them. While reading this, I thought maybe she should get like 10k or even 5k. Ask yourself this - will you ever hear the end of it because it's not half? She already isn't talking to you because of the very conversation. Unfortunately, we can't make others think like us. Your grandfather gave you the money for a reason. He wanted to help you like you helped him. My final opinion is that the money is where it is supposed to be.", "INFO: did your grandfather *particularly* cause pain to your sister growing up? Was his homophobia direct, targeted, conspicuously aimed at your sister, or was it generally expressed to all and sundry & your sister cut off contact with a number of family members, including your grandfather? \n\nI think the answer to that would inform whether she has a moral case to receive some of the money.", "NTA. Demanding *any* would be absurd, but half is extreme. I completely understand why she'd feel being left with nothing is unfair, but it was his money and he left it how he saw fit. *If* you gave her any, that would be up to you and you alone. *If* you chose to share it with her, she better find some respect for you, and fast. You aren't obligated to give her any.", "\"Am I an AH\" and \"Am I allowed to do this, like legally\" are not mutually exclusive. You have no *obligation* to share this inheritance with your sister.\n\nHowever.\n\nYour grandfather has treated your sister horribly. His isolation and his loneliness from her is entirely *his own* doing. By giving the inheritance solely to you and excluding her, he is not making a point about the fact she didn't visit, because he's the one that couldn't behave well enough to be a safe person. \n\nShe was not neglectful - he was an AH jerk who expected to have the younger generation kiss up while he insulted and disrespected both her and her wife. Its him throwing one last temper-tantrum over the fact that *his* actions have consequences - not hers.  He is making a point that he will continue to demean and criticise who she is from beyond the grave. Its not an expression of love, its an expression of hate. \n\nYou were the golden grandchild and now reap the benefits from the fact she was a target rather than because of your own action. You can't control that anymore than you can change the type of person your grandfather was. But by keeping the the inheritance - its certainly your right, but it will mean that you will always appear to have supported your grandfather's homophobic views - especially when it was beneficial to you.\n\n\"Can I?\" Yes. \"Would I be an AH\", also yes; sorry bud.

Even though you are not personally an active bigot, you know you *benefited* from bigotry, and you are ok with this. \n\nSuppose instead that your grampa and sister fell out for an unrelated, unbigoted situation, it would be different, especially since you did visit him a lot. \n\nBut really, you were only *eligible* to benefit from his bigotry because it was one step emotionally removed from you, and did not hurt you as much as it hurt your sister.\n\nBigots passing on wealth to bigot-friendly family is one way to continue the effects of the bigotry, isn't it?

I have seen these types of inheritance dramas play out. You can end up listening to all the people agreeing with you if you want. However, if you don't sort this and stick to your guns, your sister will not forgive you. Again, I have seen this play out. You will damage your relationship for life. I really mean that.\n\nSome points:\n\n1. The reason for her lack of visits was not disinterest or laziness. You could just 'resent' your grandpa for these views and not take them to heart is because you are not gay. This is not a situation of your sister failing to maintain a relationship then throwing the toys out the pram when she has no monetary gain. You need to understand that it is far more distressing to visit someone  making disparaging, awful remarks if they are actually aimed at you. If your sister went through lots of internalized shame due to being gay (as many do) visiting your grandpa could trigger this. Would you ask someone black to visit someone who is aggressively and viciously racist? It was easier for you because you are straight.\n2. If you love your sister, I actually don't think it should be based on the relationship with your grandpa. It's about you having this huge head start in life that your sister has not been given access to (through no fault of her own - again, the reason for her lack of visiting was not laziness or lack of interest). I'm guessing she is maybe thinking of starting a family, buying a house, generally doing all the things in your late twenties that would be enormously helped by inheriting money? There can be resentment between friends when one inherits money and the other doesn't. I don't think the relationship will recover if you keep the entire 50,000. It will always be a point of contention.\n3. Finally, your visits were mutually beneficial. You stated that you had similar deployment experiences and enjoyed talking to one another. The idea that you deserve a monetary reward for what was a mutually beneficial experience is slightly strange to me. You were not his carer. You did not take time off work to visit him. You were able to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with him that you both enjoyed because you are not part of a demographic that he despised. Your sister did not have that option.\n\nPlease consider some of these points with an open mind.", "I think this is just too complicated for a black and white 'YTA/NTA'. \n\nThis is less about your relationship with your grandfather and more about your relationship with your sister. Is this money worth a permanent wedge between you and your sister? Is there no compromise (say, giving her a small but not exactly half portion of it, spending it on a sizable gift for her and her wife?) that could keep the peace?\n\nYes, she cut off your grandfather, but it was for *completely valid reasons.* It would be one thing if she simply didn't want to put in the effort to maintain a relationship with him, but he was actively homophobic and that's a rough place to be as a queer person. There's a unique kind of pain in knowing your family hates you because of the people you love. I do not feel she's at fault for that. \n\nSo I'll reiterate -- is this worth the wedge it'll put between you? Is having the entire sum more valuable to you than your relationship with your sister?\n\nETA: I also think it's naive to assume she's cut from the inheritance just because she went NC. If he's still bringing up hateful homophobic comments long after she went NC, I think it's strange to assume that his own bigotry wasn't a factor in who got inheritance.", "YTA.

All of you. Now, I get why your sister got upset. She didn't assume maliciousness of you, but she did *know* it of her Grandpa. So when you held that up, of course it pissed her off! It's like losing Grandpa, plus losing her brother because you may have spoken up to him, but you know . . . your role isn't only to be a spokesperson, your sister is an *individual* in the queer community: Your role here was different, and it ought to have been to include your sister in the family. And yes, you excluded her because this was an inheritance\u2014not just money.\n\nPreface over, reasoning preceding.\n\n>It has more to due with my morals, Splitting it after how she spoke to me and the names she called me seems unreasonable\n\nThis is circular reasoning. \"Splitting it because she had a reaction to me not splitting it is why I shouldn't split it.\" I went into this, reading your write-up that doesn't excuse him, thinking \"NAH.\" Now it's \"ESH.\" Because you should be deducting the cost of all that stuff you mentioned, she shouldn't be calling you names,\\* and then you should be doing this:\n\nAsk yourself, quite honestly, if your sister would have *talked* to Grandpa if she weren't made to cut him off. Maybe not as much as you, because she didn't have something to bond with him over. Not that that's a ding on you, it wasn't a hobby that you bonded over. Here's the point though: ***giving her some of this inheritance is so that she, as a queer person, is still recognized as family.*** Not to redress a wrong of your Grandpa's\u2014it's not not make a new one yourself. Family is more than the relationship between two people, and that you're choosing to let this impact your relationship with your sister\\*\\* because you don't want to do some math and honest accounting of what she's lost and if she even matters to you as family is asinine.\n\nAgain, this isn't about the money.\\*\\*\\* You can't redress that she was so unfairly treated, not with money. Like other people have said, you didn't *sacrifice time*, you spent some money and were *blessed* with time with a person who was their for you. Your sister wasn't so blessed.\n\nBut the money in this case is an inheritance, ties back to what I've already said. Is she family, or not?\n\nAnd by the way, the suggestion to donate it to an LGBTQ charity as a 'gotcha' is as petty as a lot of the above. You'd essentially be going \"hey, here's the only thing Grandpa saw about you as important, the thing that ruined the relationship: I'm gonna remind you that you're just a queer person and you should be happy with me for it because I did it in a way that benefits you\\[r group and excludes you from this family. Because all you are is your queerness.\\]\"\n\n\\*But keep in mind it's ESH here because you both fucked up, you first, and grief is hard, and hopefully the benefit of family is understanding and walking shit like this back. By the way, I don't think \"half the money and a half-hearted apology\" is the answer, or even an apology. More like that honest accounting and an explanation, as well as a call for understanding, and some of the money as promissory of your own understanding (of your sister as family).\n\n\\*\\*Do you goddamn see how it is yet and how your standards of her feelings is bullshit? FYI, you can *both be upset here*, grief is hard. But *try.* At least try. You had that chance with Grandpa, you know how valuable it is. You can't give *that* to your sister, now that it's on you to? And sure, I can't say \"this will fix everything\" or promise the same effort from her, but . . . that's what you're holding your relationship to? \"Well, they need to be perfect first.\" Newsflash, you can have relationships with imperfect people, it's how you move forward that matters. Again, Grandpa should have taught you this lesson.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Sadly, Grandpa decided to make it so that bit was all that was left of their relationship, which is a disservice to her.", "I agree, it's not fair to split it evenly. You didn't time and resources carrying for him, and it's entirely fair that you get compensated for that labour.\n\nHowever, I do think the fair and reasonable option would be to give her *some* of the money. I mean, the reason for her cutting ties with him is very reasonable, so basically the reason for her not getting anything is his bigotry. You could kind of amend that by giving her some of it.\n\nPlus, it would go some way to repairing your relationship, which is strained by this. You kind of have to ask yourself how much the relationship is worth to you - is it more than a part of the inheritance?\n\nNTA, though. The AH in this story is your grandfather. I think it's a pretty AH move to give everything of an inheritance to a favoured grandchild, even if that grandchild was the only one who visited during the last years of his life. Especially when he drove the other one away with his opinions, which he clearly didn't manage to keep to himself.", "If there wasn't money involved,  would this be an issue at all? Give her five thousand dollars and see if she'll take it but you don't have to give her half", "Again, it's not about the money. It's about whether you want to benefit from homophobia. Sure, legally you can. But it's as if I claimed to despise antisemitism while hoarding nazi gold, it's just hypocritical. If you are benefitting from homophobia, have a choice to make things a bit more fair but choose not to, you can't really say you have a problem with homophobia.", "I doubt it. He sounds misogynistic.", "We all know the grandfather is an AH, and we can see that his arguments for excluding his granddaughter are predicated on bad faith and his own bigotry. But it also says things about who the *OP* is, because the OP is *benefiting from bigotry* just as much or even more than the sister is being entitled. \n\nWhen what you say and what you do are in disconnect, its what you do that people and history use to determine who you are.        \n\nThe OP says 'I always called grandpa out when he said these things'. He is the only one who will ever know if that's true; he was the only one there. The action *his sister* is seeing is 'I will not share this inheritance even though I know it was grandfather's actions that ruined your relationship, not yours.'\n\nThe message his sister is going to hear is \"I will not defy bigotry when it benefits me\", and then the slope to \"my support and love for you was insincere\" is not especially slippery.\n\nTBH, I suspect that's a part (though not all) of the reason she's demanding so loudly. A subconcious 'Please tell me you're not actually this kind of person, I believed you were better than him'.       \nWe know grandfather said very cruel, targeted things about his granddaughter to her face. It should not be followed up with her own brother's response implying the message \"Well if you wanted money so much you should have let yourself continue to be subjected to abuse, damned if it led you to suicide or not\" - because if that's what she hears it no longer matters if that's what the OP meant or not.", "\"When you go nc with someone, like OP\u2019s sister did... you cut all ties, you don\u2019t get to come back around with your hand out once they die\"\n\nYou made that up. You literally just made a up a rule right here and now for a woman you've never met, living a life you've never witnessed, who doesn't know you and who never agreed to it.\n\n**Put it back where you got it.**", "Sure, and I do agree to an extent the bigger point is that by keeping all of the inheritance (however fairly obtained by staying in contact) it is kind of perpetuating the grandpa\u2019s views because she wouldn\u2019t have gone NC if he didn\u2019t have those views on homosexuality. It\u2019s far more nuanced than just a regular falling out", "What was the condition of the sister going NC? Did the sister just decide it herself, was it her idea and willing choice? Or did the grandfather decide it by disowning her, refusing to talk to her, or only saying hurtful things to her?", "Yeah I totally appreciate this. I think it's admirable that he provided that support for you. And it's obviously had a monumental impact on your life. \n\nI don't think you should feel guilty for not cancelling visits, given this context. \n\nBut I can see why your sister would see this as a kick in the guts. She's not being punished because she went NC, like many on here are arguing. She's being punished because she's gay. \n\nI see redistributing the money (whether that be to her, or even to a charity) as a sort of reparation for the damage your grandfather's views would have undoubtedly caused to her and her partner. Id be devastated if my grandparent hated me for my sexuality. And it would be a very hard pill to swallow to watch family members continue on a loving relationship with that person.", "Let\u2019s be honest though, he wouldn\u2019t have listened to or talked to or \u201csaved your life\u201d if you were the gay sibling. You can\u2019t see it because you benefitted from it, but his love for you was conditional too. He wasn\u2019t a good person, he was just useful to you. If I was your sister, this would be the end of our relationship.", "I believe you and I appreciate this. What you describe are very strong reasons for maintaining a relationship with him. You've made it very understandable. I don't think it was wrong at all and I'm glad you're in a healthier place now. I'm very glad he was able to help you. \n\nBut your sister didn't have the option of maintaining a relationship because he rejected who she was on a fundamental level. That is fundamentally unfair to her and it gives you an unearned advantage in being able to benefit from your grandfather's love and counsel, and now, his will.\n\nThe fair thing to do would be to show your sister you believe your grandfather should have treated you equally. Split the inheritance with her. You will be glad you did for the rest of your life.", "You're NTA. You're not responsible for other people's actions. Your sister is greedy. Don't give her shit.", "I understand that this was a delicate situation for you and you couldn\u2019t easily cut off your grandpa. But can you honestly say you still would\u2019ve gotten 100% of the inheritance if your sister wasn\u2019t gay? If your grandfather wasn\u2019t homophobic, wouldn\u2019t your sister have a relationship with him? If you can agree that the only reason your sister didn\u2019t have a relationship with your grandpa is his homophobia, can you really agree with his choice to cut her out of the will? Do you really want to help your grandpa hurt your sister again?", "The reason you\u2019ve given above for visiting him makes perfect sense to me, and it\u2019s understandable that you can have disliked his views whilst also liking his company.\n\n\nHowever, in the same breath you say that you\u2019re owed the full inheritance because you\u2019re the only person that kept on visiting him, which feels like you\u2019re treating the inheritance as payment for your time.\n\n\nYou said you almost stopped visiting him because you hated his views so much, but he understood you in a way no one else did and you clicked over that. Fine. But don\u2019t then pretend that you\u2019re owed the money because you kept visiting him - you know full well why your sister couldn\u2019t keep visiting, and in your own words you almost stopped too.\n\n\nKeeping the full inheritance is a kick in the teeth to your sister and undermines any solidarity you claimed to have with her. You are both grandchildren and neither of you worked for that money. The only reason you have it is because you\u2019re straight. You don\u2019t legally have to give her anything, but you\u2019re definitely morally in the wrong for not acknowledging the unfairness.", "Yes, let's just refer to the evidence we have shall we:\n* OP says he called out his grandfather on his bigotry\n* Despite known bigotry, OP kept hanging out with grandfather\n* Grandfather dies, and bequeaths funds to OP in appreciation for his ongoing support. Funds are not bequeathed to the other sibling because, as we know, grandfather was bigoted \n\nThe last two things on this list rather undermine the positive impact that the first had, imo.", "[deleted]", "Well spotted! Knows deep down he's the AH but looking for internet people to persuade him otherwise. Seems to be working unfortunately.", "It\u2019s someone being homophobic, not an asshole. There\u2019s a difference.", "A few things.\n\n50,000$ is a life changing amount of money, so is 25k.\n\nOP also wants the money all to himself, is that not also greed?\n\nGrandfather deliberately hurt and belittled sister for something she was born with.

My NC status with my grandfather was brutally traumatic because he went from being my entire world, more than a father to me, to literally wanting me to go somewhere and die the moment I came out of the closet. I have almost 20 years of happy and loving memories with my grandfather followed by almost 20 years of him loathing me and refusing to talk to me. Until, of course, he died, and now I just have sorrow, heartache, and and no closure.\n\nIts not entirely like going NC with an ex, and its also an entirely different feeling from being NC with say, my mentally ill narcissist mother, who was a terrible person from the get-go and never showed me any degree of love. Its a far, far more painful NC. I would never want to hear anything about an ex or my mother again for as long as I live, but half my life so far is full of the happiest memories of a man who became my worst enemy for reasons entirely outside of my control.", "Fair enough, thank you for the input", "Yes without a doubt. Veterans support veterans, the bond runs deeper than anything I have witnessed. We may disagree about everything on earth but we would still have each others backs", "I chose the wrong word, it is 3:38 am where I live and I haven\u2019t slept yet. You are welcome to believe whatever you choose but I genuinely used the wrong word", "Yeah I clearly don\u2019t give a fuck about her feelings. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t spent the last 28 years of my life loving, supporting and cheering her on. I cried after the conversation we had about the inheritance, something I haven\u2019t done for years. You can type whatever you want like the keyboard warrior you are but my love for my sister is unaffected. If you think I am the ah based on the info I have provided that is completely fair but I won\u2019t let you call me something I\u2019m not", "\nI am so sorry for your experience.", "We re not discussing here why sister went NC or what their relationship was. The discussion is if she deserves the money and the answer is simply no.", "Sorry, but I can't wrap my head around this - you said he held 'extreme' viewpoints and yet he would abandon them because you're a veteran? Here 'extreme viewpoints' on this subject mean kicking your children out, doesn't matter if they're still minors, beating someone up literally just for having a pride flag in your backpack (I wish I was making it up) and then saying they 'provoked' you by that, setting literal homemade bombs at pride parades. You might be right in saying he would support you either way, I just can't believe it looking at the words you chose to describe him.", "I\u2019m gay OP and honestly I can understand her issue. It probably sucks to see your sibling benefit from family that was never accessible to you in the first place. It might even feel like a last F U from your grandfather. \n\nWith that said accepting pity money from a man who hated me is not something I would want and I am not well off at all, in fact the exact opposite. \n\nNTA and enjoy your inheritance. This isn\u2019t a homophobic issue, this is a greed issue. She has a right to her feelings about your grandfather but not a right to his/your money. You put in the work in loving your grandpa and he returned the favor. Sorry for your loss and good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "But apparently her feelings aren't worth 25k to you, otherwise you wouldn't be on here looking for justification for not splitting the inheritance.", "But when deciding if OP is the asshole, the reason for NC needs to be taken into consideration. \n\nIt sounds like the Grandfather verbally abused OP's sister. OP's sister does deserve an amount. I agree with some that it shouldn't be half, but if I was OP I would give a third. \n\nWhen my grandmother was dying, I visited her almost every day - I was there when she died. My mum looked after my grandmother. My uncle and his son live overseas. My mum and her brother recieved the same amount in my grandmother's will. My cousin barely spoke to my grandmother over the phone, yet he, my brother and I received the same amounts. Did I think it was fair? No, especially as my cousin hardly knew or cared about my grandmother and my mother paid for things for my grandmother. Added to that, just because you spend time with someone, it doesn't mean that you deserve more or anything from a person. OP was being a good grandson, but in this case not a good brother as his grandfather verbally abused his sister.", "It's not whether she deserves the money, really. It's whether OP is an asshole or not for not sharing some regardless when he's reaping the benefits of her abuse.", "Extreme may have been the wrong word. He has never been violent nor physically threatening to lgbtq people but he has said some nasty things that I think are extreme. To me hating someone for who they love is extreme in of itself", "Right, I just love my sister so much! But not enough to give her any money from my homophobic grandfather :/", "I am not paying for my sisters love. I love her unconditionally, if she will let money get in the way of our bond despite her being 10X more financially secure than me that\u2019s her decision"]}
