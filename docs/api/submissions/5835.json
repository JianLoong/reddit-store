I would visit 1-2 times a month to check in on him, play cards, bring him on walks etc. The main reason for these visits was because when I was at the lowest point in my life after getting home from deployment my grandfather was always there to listen and talk with me. We were both combat veterans so he understood me on a level other people couldn\u2019t. Here is where the problem lies, my grandfather held a lot of extreme viewpoints that I did not agree with, more specifically against the LGBTQ+ community. I resented my grandpa for these views and called him out whenever he would say something inappropriate, I was very close to ending the visits because of these views but decided against it for reasons discussed prior. My sister (28 F) is happily married to a woman (31 F) and therefore obviously cut off contact with my grandfather, my sister and I have a very good relationship in general but would frequently fight over my continued relationship with my grandpa. When he passed away and left me the money I did not think there would be any argument over it as my sister wanted nothing to do with him (understandably so).However when she found out about it she demanded that she should receive half of the money, I was shocked and basically told her no way as she was not the one who had been visiting and providing care for him for the last 5 years. My sister was visibly angry and we have not been on speaking terms since, This has left me wondering wether I am the AH as my sister was a victim of my grandfathers bigotry, however I don\u2019t think half the money is a reasonable request.

Honestly I think YTA if you don\u2019t give her at least a little (but not necessarily half).\n\nLet\u2019s think about this in practical terms - yes you\u2019re the only one that visited, and normally I\u2019d say yes keep it all. But the reason your sister didn\u2019t visit is because she is LGBTQ+, how can you realistically expect her to uphold a relationship with a man that hates who she is? And if he made those comments enough for you to call him out on it, I can\u2019t imagine your sister would have got away unscathed if she had visited.\n\nNo, she doesn\u2019t have the right to demand any money, *technically* it is all yours.

Here\u2019s an interesting thought exercise (just a thought exercise\u2026don\u2019t actually do this). What do you think sister would do if you said you decided to donate half the money to an LGBT org? Would she be happy with that, or would she still demand you give her the money? I suspect the latter.\n\nI am estranged from an abusive relative. If he left me any money I would decline to accept or immediately donate it to a women\u2019s shelter or something. If he left me nothing I would actually be relieved. That\u2019s why I suspect sister would still want the money.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Half the money is a bit extreme considering she put in no effort and you sacrificed 1-2 days/week for 5 years. I may offer some to keep the peace, as she was subject to bigotry by his words and could offer some consolation for her pain and suffering. However, this is another classic case of \"money tearing families apart\" and it's really up to her if she wants to let greed come between her relationship with her brother. NTA OP, sorry you're in this position. You are every bit entitled to this money.", "NTA. It's your grandfathers last will. Even if he had some questionable Views, it should be respected. I don't blame your sister for resenting your Grandfather and cutting ties with him for that, but demanding half of his money just because they are related is an AH Move for sure.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t deserve anything. She left. That means she gave up on everything to do with him. I get his views were wrong but regardless it was his money and he got to choose what he wanted to do with it. And if she is easily willing to give up on you too over something so fickle then that says a lot about her character", "NTA\n\nYou didn't spend time with him for the money and you also didn't allow him to say bigoted things to you unchecked. \n\nYou had your own, understandable reasons for the connection and your sister gave you a hard time for it while he was living. She showed no empathy for why you needed him in your life because she felt her grievances against him were more important.\n\nIf you cut someone out of your life, no matter how valid your reasons are for doing so, you cannot expect something from them when they're gone.", "Tentive NTA, your sister didn't really have a choice about visiting your grandfather, I mean how could she? He literally hated a part of her and it isn't a lifestyle its who she is, not sure why so many people yourself included are holding this against her.\n\nIt is your money but remember it's only yours because your grandfather literally hated your sister because of something she had no say in. I am sorry for your lose but try and remember your sister has been grieving the lose of her grandparent from when HE basically made it impossible for her to visit him.", "NTA i dont agree or support the view your grandad had but you supported him and he supported you.", "Tough one but I\u2019ll go with NAH regarding the inheritance. On the one hand, sis has no claim to the money as she wasn\u2019t there for him. Under normal circumstances I\u2019d call her an AH for expecting you to share. \nOn the other hand, she had very good reason not to be there for him and to feel sort of betrayed by you for supporting him. And considering his views he likely still wouldn\u2019t have given her anything if she had supported him because the real AH in all this is him.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe her anything but you need to accept that the effort on your part didn\u2019t remotely compare to the effort it would\u2019ve been for her to do the same. Seeing as you generally have a good relationship, you should get in touch and try to find a solution you\u2018re both happy with. I can\u2019t imagine this is worth your relationship.", "NTA.

We the internet can't judge that but I bet you could if you were honest.  You made an extraordinary effort to provide support to him, and have been rewarded.  If you have good reason to think your sister would have done the same, then maybe you could give her some.  But in my experience it is rare to find anyone going so out of their way as you did.", "NTA. Your sister has no reason to get involved with your grandfather's choice. Don't feel back your doing g nothing wrong. Sorry you are going through this after losing your grandfather.", "Nta and your sister obviously wanted nothing to do with him which was completely warranted.  \ud83d\ude44  . However people always have lots to say when money is involved .", "On the one hand, it was your grandfather's decision and you can honor it. On the other, if you uphold his cutting off your sister you are upholding the same bigotry he supported that drove her away. Self-respect says that's inappropriate (as you say). \n\nHonestly, I would share at least a fifth/quarter with her. It's not completely A H territory, but you will probably lose a relationship with your sister if you share nothing. Is that a consequence you're okay with?", "NAH - I don't think you're an asshole, but I think your sister's request is reasonable and you should split the money.\n\nYour grandfather shunned your sister because of her sexual preferences. She may have wanted to have a relationship with him, but he made it clear that he was unable to accept her. You say that you recognise how awful this was and resented it and nearly ended your visits. But in the end, you did carry on seeing your grandfather for other reasons. Fine.\n\nHad your grandfather not been so bigoted, he would probably have split the inheritance between his grandchildren, but he gave it all to you because he didn't accept your sister. Now, you not sharing the inheritance looks like you are condoning and going along with his non-acceptance of your sister, even though you previously said your grandfather was wrong. It might even send the message that you agree with him. Splitting the money would not only be fairer but would demonstrate to your sister that you care about her.\n\nA 50/50 split would be the simplest way to go. If you find that difficult to stomach due to the hours you spent looking after him in his old age, then an unequal split might work. But if you insist on keeping all the money, then you should accept that it will damage your relationship with your sister forever. Is it worth it?", "NTA. I have no other insight.", "NTA.  Funny how once there\u2019s money involved, relatives come crawling out of the woodwork. Absolutely do not give her half as she\u2019s a hypocrite.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nI hate to say it like this, but your grandfather was raised in a different time. You are allowed to hate something about someone, but still love them. While reading this, I thought maybe she should get like 10k or even 5k. Ask yourself this - will you ever hear the end of it because it's not half? She already isn't talking to you because of the very conversation. Unfortunately, we can't make others think like us. Your grandfather gave you the money for a reason. He wanted to help you like you helped him. My final opinion is that the money is where it is supposed to be.", "INFO: did your grandfather *particularly* cause pain to your sister growing up? Was his homophobia direct, targeted, conspicuously aimed at your sister, or was it generally expressed to all and sundry & your sister cut off contact with a number of family members, including your grandfather? \n\nI think the answer to that would inform whether she has a moral case to receive some of the money.", "NTA. Demanding *any* would be absurd, but half is extreme. I completely understand why she'd feel being left with nothing is unfair, but it was his money and he left it how he saw fit. *If* you gave her any, that would be up to you and you alone. *If* you chose to share it with her, she better find some respect for you, and fast. You aren't obligated to give her any.", "\"Am I an AH\" and \"Am I allowed to do this, like legally\" are not mutually exclusive. You have no *obligation* to share this inheritance with your sister.\n\nHowever.\n\nYour grandfather has treated your sister horribly. His isolation and his loneliness from her is entirely *his own* doing. By giving the inheritance solely to you and excluding her, he is not making a point about the fact she didn't visit, because he's the one that couldn't behave well enough to be a safe person. \n\nShe was not neglectful - he was an AH jerk who expected to have the younger generation kiss up while he insulted and disrespected both her and her wife. Its him throwing one last temper-tantrum over the fact that *his* actions have consequences - not hers.  He is making a point that he will continue to demean and criticise who she is from beyond the grave. Its not an expression of love, its an expression of hate. \n\nYou were the golden grandchild and now reap the benefits from the fact she was a target rather than because of your own action. You can't control that anymore than you can change the type of person your grandfather was. But by keeping the the inheritance - its certainly your right, but it will mean that you will always appear to have supported your grandfather's homophobic views - especially when it was beneficial to you.\n\n\"Can I?\" Yes. \"Would I be an AH\", also yes; sorry bud.

Bigoted or not, your grandfather had the right to leave his money to whoever he wanted and he chose you. Your sister demanding it is completely inappropriate.

Pretty much ignoring the fact that she was literally, in OPs words,  a target to grandpa's homophobia.

Oh she was struggling... but no, that homophobia didn't have an effect on her mental health, not like me... she couldn't have a relationship with him... but I could so why does she deserve the money, she didn't \"try\".\n\nYou're doing some mental gymnastics to justify being shitty.

Even though you are not personally an active bigot, you know you *benefited* from bigotry, and you are ok with this. \n\nSuppose instead that your grampa and sister fell out for an unrelated, unbigoted situation, it would be different, especially since you did visit him a lot. \n\nBut really, you were only *eligible* to benefit from his bigotry because it was one step emotionally removed from you, and did not hurt you as much as it hurt your sister.\n\nBigots passing on wealth to bigot-friendly family is one way to continue the effects of the bigotry, isn't it? Didn't your Bigot Grampa drive her away, and abandon her?

I have seen these types of inheritance dramas play out. You can end up listening to all the people agreeing with you if you want. However, if you don't sort this and stick to your guns, your sister will not forgive you. Again, I have seen this play out. You will damage your relationship for life. I really mean that.\n\nSome points:\n\n1. The reason for her lack of visits was not disinterest or laziness. You could just 'resent' your grandpa for these views and not take them to heart is because you are not gay. This is not a situation of your sister failing to maintain a relationship then throwing the toys out the pram when she has no monetary gain. You need to understand that it is far more distressing to visit someone  making disparaging, awful remarks if they are actually aimed at you. If your sister went through lots of internalized shame due to being gay (as many do) visiting your grandpa could trigger this. Would you ask someone black to visit someone who is aggressively and viciously racist? It was easier for you because you are straight.\n2. If you love your sister, I actually don't think it should be based on the relationship with your grandpa. It's about you having this huge head start in life that your sister has not been given access to (through no fault of her own - again, the reason for her lack of visiting was not laziness or lack of interest). I'm guessing she is maybe thinking of starting a family, buying a house, generally doing all the things in your late twenties that would be enormously helped by inheriting money? There can be resentment between friends when one inherits money and the other doesn't. I don't think the relationship will recover if you keep the entire 50,000. It will always be a point of contention.\n3. Finally, your visits were mutually beneficial. You stated that you had similar deployment experiences and enjoyed talking to one another. The idea that you deserve a monetary reward for what was a mutually beneficial experience is slightly strange to me. You were not his carer. You did not take time off work to visit him. You were able to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with him that you both enjoyed because you are not part of a demographic that he despised. Your sister did not have that option.\n\nPlease consider some of these points with an open mind.", "I think this is just too complicated for a black and white 'YTA/NTA'. \n\nThis is less about your relationship with your grandfather and more about your relationship with your sister. Is this money worth a permanent wedge between you and your sister? Is there no compromise (say, giving her a small but not exactly half portion of it, spending it on a sizable gift for her and her wife?) that could keep the peace?\n\nYes, she cut off your grandfather, but it was for *completely valid reasons.* It would be one thing if she simply didn't want to put in the effort to maintain a relationship with him, but he was actively homophobic and that's a rough place to be as a queer person. There's a unique kind of pain in knowing your family hates you because of the people you love. I do not feel she's at fault for that. \n\nSo I'll reiterate -- is this worth the wedge it'll put between you? Is having the entire sum more valuable to you than your relationship with your sister?\n\nETA: I also think it's naive to assume she's cut from the inheritance just because she went NC. If he's still bringing up hateful homophobic comments long after she went NC, I think it's strange to assume that his own bigotry wasn't a factor in who got inheritance.", "YTA.

The right question is \"do I want to continue having a relationship with my sister, and if so, how much is that worth to me?\" Because if you decide to keep all the money, she's going to view that as an extension of grandpa's bigotry, and likely choose to protect herself from you like she chose to protect herself from him.\n\nDoes she have a justifiable argument for why she should get some? Yes. Do you have a justifiable argument for why you should keep it all? Also yes. Reasonable people can make arguments for either scenario.

Because it was unfair my kind and gentle sister was effectively punished by a woman who'd never met her, just for being fat and not going to uni. Because I'd have felt shit for taking that money and keeping it to myself, effectively agreeing 'Yes, Great Aunt's reasoning is fair' just because it benefitted me.

You got 300 hours of FREE therapy, only having to pay for gas money to get there.\n\nMeanwhile, your sister, like a lot of people who are LGBT, will probably need to pay for her own therapy since she has been traumatised by abusive family members... coincidentally, the same family member who provided therapy for you AND gave you all his money.\n\nI'm sorry, dude, but you come across as someone who just isn't terribly sympathetic or understanding of your sister. YTA.", "Please read this. It is harsh. I don't think you're a bad person. I'm sorry you lost your Grandpa and glad he was there for you\u2014def. see about keeping a support network up.\n\nI'll preface that most all the harshness herein is because I'm genuinely pissed you'd lose a relationship out of spite when already losing one. I've lost my Grandpa recently, too, and wholly heck has there been miscommunication galore when, as family\u2014if you value that in your life, which your relationship with Grandpa and initial write-up seem to indicate, and now your judging your sister for this impacting her also would seem to also indicate, yes\u2014you should be assuming something less than maliciousness. All of you. Now, I get why your sister got upset. She didn't assume maliciousness of you, but she did *know* it of her Grandpa. So when you held that up, of course it pissed her off! It's like losing Grandpa, plus losing her brother because you may have spoken up to him, but you know . . . your role isn't only to be a spokesperson, your sister is an *individual* in the queer community: Your role here was different, and it ought to have been to include your sister in the family. And yes, you excluded her because this was an inheritance\u2014not just money.\n\nPreface over, reasoning preceding.\n\n>It has more to due with my morals, Splitting it after how she spoke to me and the names she called me seems unreasonable\n\nThis is circular reasoning. \"Splitting it because she had a reaction to me not splitting it is why I shouldn't split it.\" I went into this, reading your write-up that doesn't excuse him, thinking \"NAH.\" Now it's \"ESH.\" Because you should be deducting the cost of all that stuff you mentioned, she shouldn't be calling you names,\\* and then you should be doing this:\n\nAsk yourself, quite honestly, if your sister would have *talked* to Grandpa if she weren't made to cut him off. Maybe not as much as you, because she didn't have something to bond with him over. Not that that's a ding on you, it wasn't a hobby that you bonded over. Here's the point though: ***giving her some of this inheritance is so that she, as a queer person, is still recognized as family.*** Not to redress a wrong of your Grandpa's\u2014it's not not make a new one yourself. Family is more than the relationship between two people, and that you're choosing to let this impact your relationship with your sister\\*\\* because you don't want to do some math and honest accounting of what she's lost and if she even matters to you as family is asinine.\n\nAgain, this isn't about the money.\\*\\*\\* You can't redress that she was so unfairly treated, not with money. Like other people have said, you didn't *sacrifice time*, you spent some money and were *blessed* with time with a person who was their for you. Your sister wasn't so blessed.\n\nBut the money in this case is an inheritance, ties back to what I've already said. Is she family, or not?\n\nAnd by the way, the suggestion to donate it to an LGBTQ charity as a 'gotcha' is as petty as a lot of the above. You'd essentially be going \"hey, here's the only thing Grandpa saw about you as important, the thing that ruined the relationship: I'm gonna remind you that you're just a queer person and you should be happy with me for it because I did it in a way that benefits you\\[r group and excludes you from this family. Because all you are is your queerness.\\]\"\n\n\\*But keep in mind it's ESH here because you both fucked up, you first, and grief is hard, and hopefully the benefit of family is understanding and walking shit like this back. By the way, I don't think \"half the money and a half-hearted apology\" is the answer, or even an apology. More like that honest accounting\u2014I read another reply, seems like he would've given you more than half because of need caused by military service\u2014and an explanation, as well as a call for understanding, and some of the money as promissory of your own understanding (of your sister as family).\n\n\\*\\*Do you goddamn see how it is yet and how your standards of her feelings is bullshit? FYI, you can *both be upset here*, grief is hard. But *try.* At least try. You had that chance with Grandpa, you know how valuable it is. You can't give *that* to your sister, now that it's on you to? And sure, I can't say \"this will fix everything\" or promise the same effort from her, but . . . that's what you're holding your relationship to? \"Well, they need to be perfect first.\" Newsflash, you can have relationships with imperfect people, it's how you move forward that matters. Again, Grandpa should have taught you this lesson.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Sadly, Grandpa decided to make it so that bit was all that was left of their relationship, which is a disservice to her.", "I agree, it's not fair to split it evenly. You didn't time and resources carrying for him, and it's entirely fair that you get compensated for that labour.\n\nHowever, I do think the fair and reasonable option would be to give her *some* of the money. I mean, the reason for her cutting ties with him is very reasonable, so basically the reason for her not getting anything is his bigotry. You could kind of amend that by giving her some of it.\n\nPlus, it would go some way to repairing your relationship, which is strained by this. You kind of have to ask yourself how much the relationship is worth to you - is it more than a part of the inheritance?\n\nNTA, though. The AH in this story is your grandfather. I think it's a pretty AH move to give everything of an inheritance to a favoured grandchild, even if that grandchild was the only one who visited during the last years of his life. Especially when he drove the other one away with his opinions, which he clearly didn't manage to keep to himself.", "If there wasn't money involved,  would this be an issue at all? Give her five thousand dollars and see if she'll take it but you don't have to give her half", "Again, it's not about the money. It's about whether you want to benefit from homophobia. Sure, legally you can. But it's as if I claimed to despise antisemitism while hoarding nazi gold, it's just hypocritical. If you are benefitting from homophobia, have a choice to make things a bit more fair but choose not to, you can't really say you have a problem with homophobia.", "I doubt it. He sounds misogynistic.", "We all know the grandfather is an AH, and we can see that his arguments for excluding his granddaughter are predicated on bad faith and his own bigotry. But it also says things about who the *OP* is, because the OP is *benefiting from bigotry* just as much or even more than the sister is being entitled. \n\nWhen what you say and what you do are in disconnect, its what you do that people and history use to determine who you are.        \n\nThe OP says 'I always called grandpa out when he said these things'. He is the only one who will ever know if that's true; he was the only one there. The action *his sister* is seeing is 'I will not share this inheritance even though I know it was grandfather's actions that ruined your relationship, not yours.'\n\nThe message his sister is going to hear is \"I will not defy bigotry when it benefits me\", and then the slope to \"my support and love for you was insincere\" is not especially slippery.\n\nTBH, I suspect that's a part (though not all) of the reason she's demanding so loudly. A subconcious 'Please tell me you're not actually this kind of person, I believed you were better than him'.       \nWe know grandfather said very cruel, targeted things about his granddaughter to her face. It should not be followed up with her own brother's response implying the message \"Well if you wanted money so much you should have let yourself continue to be subjected to abuse, damned if it led you to suicide or not\" - because if that's what she hears it no longer matters if that's what the OP meant or not.", "\"When you go nc with someone, like OP\u2019s sister did... you cut all ties, you don\u2019t get to come back around with your hand out once they die\"\n\nYou made that up.

It\u2019s far more nuanced than just a regular falling out", "What was the condition of the sister going NC? Did the sister just decide it herself, was it her idea and willing choice? Or did the grandfather decide it by disowning her, refusing to talk to her, or only saying hurtful things to her?", "Yeah I totally appreciate this. I think it's admirable that he provided that support for you. And it's obviously had a monumental impact on your life. \n\nI don't think you should feel guilty for not cancelling visits, given this context. \n\nBut I can see why your sister would see this as a kick in the guts. She's not being punished because she went NC, like many on here are arguing. She's being punished because she's gay. \n\nI see redistributing the money (whether that be to her, or even to a charity) as a sort of reparation for the damage your grandfather's views would have undoubtedly caused to her and her partner. Id be devastated if my grandparent hated me for my sexuality. And it would be a very hard pill to swallow to watch family members continue on a loving relationship with that person.", "Let\u2019s be honest though, he wouldn\u2019t have listened to or talked to or \u201csaved your life\u201d if you were the gay sibling. You can\u2019t see it because you benefitted from it, but his love for you was conditional too. He wasn\u2019t a good person, he was just useful to you. If I was your sister, this would be the end of our relationship.", "I believe you and I appreciate this. What you describe are very strong reasons for maintaining a relationship with him. You've made it very understandable. I don't think it was wrong at all and I'm glad you're in a healthier place now. I'm very glad he was able to help you. \n\nBut your sister didn't have the option of maintaining a relationship because he rejected who she was on a fundamental level. That is fundamentally unfair to her and it gives you an unearned advantage in being able to benefit from your grandfather's love and counsel, and now, his will.\n\nThe fair thing to do would be to show your sister you believe your grandfather should have treated you equally. Split the inheritance with her. You will be glad you did for the rest of your life.", "You're NTA. You're not responsible for other people's actions. Your sister is greedy. Don't give her shit.", "I understand that this was a delicate situation for you and you couldn\u2019t easily cut off your grandpa. But can you honestly say you still would\u2019ve gotten 100% of the inheritance if your sister wasn\u2019t gay? If your grandfather wasn\u2019t homophobic, wouldn\u2019t your sister have a relationship with him? If you can agree that the only reason your sister didn\u2019t have a relationship with your grandpa is his homophobia, can you really agree with his choice to cut her out of the will? Do you really want to help your grandpa hurt your sister again?", "The reason you\u2019ve given above for visiting him makes perfect sense to me, and it\u2019s understandable that you can have disliked his views whilst also liking his company.\n\n\nHowever, in the same breath you say that you\u2019re owed the full inheritance because you\u2019re the only person that kept on visiting him, which feels like you\u2019re treating the inheritance as payment for your time.\n\n\nYou said you almost stopped visiting him because you hated his views so much, but he understood you in a way no one else did and you clicked over that. Fine. But don\u2019t then pretend that you\u2019re owed the money because you kept visiting him - you know full well why your sister couldn\u2019t keep visiting, and in your own words you almost stopped too.\n\n\nKeeping the full inheritance is a kick in the teeth to your sister and undermines any solidarity you claimed to have with her. You are both grandchildren and neither of you worked for that money. The only reason you have it is because you\u2019re straight. You don\u2019t legally have to give her anything, but you\u2019re definitely morally in the wrong for not acknowledging the unfairness.", "Yes, let's just refer to the evidence we have shall we:\n* OP says he called out his grandfather on his bigotry\n* Despite known bigotry, OP kept hanging out with grandfather\n* Grandfather dies, and bequeaths funds to OP in appreciation for his ongoing support.

I understand you might not want to share half of the money, and you're entitled to that as you \"earned\" it by visiting him when no one did. But if you want to keep s good relationship with your sister consider giving her like 1/5th of the money (10k) as a good will gesture for the pain she endured.

OP might have the legal right to the money, but do you not think it's at least reasonable for him to stop and consider why he had the opportunity to get it and she did not?

If he was biased against her maybe he already cut her off from being an heir before she made the decision to stop seeing him. And she only stopped seeing him because he was spewing hate .

Sure, OP can keep all that, and I hope he reaps the karmic rewards that come from profiting off pain.", "Why not? Dead bigots get no respect, ok? She should get the money to spite his hatred. A good brother would see that, considering he repeatedly claims to have hated his grandfather's bigotry (we don't know if he's telling the truth)", "I do think the reason for the fallout makes a difference -- while we don't know what the grandfather said/did to her directly, or if he explicitly disinherited her when she came out or got married or anything like that, it's pretty clear that his love and money were much less available to her because she wasn't straight.  OP visited their grandfather once or twice a month and still had trouble with those visits; I can only imagine what they would've been like for his sister, who almost certainly could never have brought her spouse along.  OP suffered through the visits; his sister suffered through not having a grandfather who accepted the way she was born.  \n\nI don't think that means she should automatically get half.  I do think it makes it less fair to not offer her anything.  OP certainly has no legal obligation to offer her anything; I don't know that not offering crosses into AH territory, but it's certainly not familial or kind under the circumstances.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hypocritical to want inheritance after cutting ties for THIS particular reason. If they fell out for a reasonable disagreement, that\u2019s one thing. Grandpa was against who the sister was as a HUMAN. Even if she didn\u2019t cut ties he likely would have cut her from the will for being gay. That\u2019s BS", ">SHE denied herself the relationship. Understandably so, but still, it was her choice. If we can believe OP he voiced his opposition to his grandfathers view but STILL visited. Sister could have chosen to do the same.\n\nA coerced choice is no choice at all. OP wasn't the target of the abuse, she was, so saying she could've chosen to do the same is ignoring how *vastly* different their two situations are. \n\nMore to the point, OP has said in the comments that grandfather would have denied her the inheritance regardless of her choice. It was explicitly because of who she is, and there's nothing that could've changed that. \n\n>But your 'same situation' is not the same. In your hypothetical, the grandfather would presumably know there was a physical reason for no visits and the sister could have kept contact by mail/phone/zoom.\n\nFair to say that the analogy isn't perfect, but I actually think your suggestion of mail/phone/zoom strengthens it - grandpa denying all of those and saying \"physical visits only\" seems fairly apt given that he denied the option of treating his granddaughter with respect when she tried to have a relationship with him.", "She wasn't even given the option to care for him, dude. He wouldn't have let him near her unless she put up with his bigoted views. Honestly, I'm really side-eyeing you for continuing to visit him after you know what he said, and if you were my brother that'd be a huge punch in face, you continuing to benefit and take support from a homophobe.", "I don\u2019t think you owe her half.

When I went NC with a manipulative and emotionally abusive family member, it was technically a choice but the reality is so much more complicated than that.

My grandmother was a homophobe. She constantly spoke about how much sin he was living in and she worried for his soul. She never made light on the fact that she did not agree with his lifestyle.

He has wonderful memories of her being there for him when he was sick and she taught him how to cook. So, yes, it hurt when she kept going on about her homophobia, but he considered her sick and would still take care of her because it was the right thing to do.

The remaining $40,000 I'll split with you 50/50 because I don't think he should have treated you as he did\"\n\nYou decide what you want, but I feel like something like that would be \"fair\".

And I don't bring all of this up to say you would definitely be TA if you didn't give her any money, not at all, it's not your fault your grandpa was like that and it's not your fault he decided to leave her out of it, and now it's your money that you can do whatever you want with, and she's definitely wrong in expecting any at all, but I'm just saying, you're both already in this situation and there's no getting out of it until you make a decision, and in that decision you'll essentially be answering the question, is 25k worth not talking to your sister ever again?", "NAH but don\u2019t expect a relationship with your sister after this.

You got lucky bcus you were born a straight man. That\u2019s it. You got the birth lottery and it helped you with your generational wealth. \n\nLGBT+ children not receiving the same generational wealth as their straight family members is a massive problem, and a part of the challenges faced by queer people.

Is your long relationship with your sister worth the 50K?  She will hold it against you for the REST of your life and hers.

The bigot's money is yours, congratulations. Your sister isn't owed it, but you don't deserve it either. You were awarded for turning your back on your sister. Does that make you really happy? If you wanted to do right by the LGBT community and your sister, you would not be keeping that money for yourself. Perhaps you could donate some of it to the Trevor Project or something? I can understand visiting him and trying to change his perspective so he could reunite with his granddaughter before he passed, but he died a bigot with bigot money. You profited from hate. The only reason your sister didn't get that money was because of hate, not because she wasn't willing to build a relationship with your grandfather. There's a reason why allies are important- its sometimes impossible for a queer person to convince a homophobe that they aren't \"lying to themselves\" or \"living in sin.\" Sometimes it takes someone \"normal\" like yourself to educate others. You failed upwards. Once again, congrats on the bigot money.", "YTA, you knew about his beliefs but kept quiet for your own purposes, very disrespectful to your sister. Yikes.", "Soft YTA: I personally would have planned on splitting any inheritance with her as she was not able to have a caring real relationship with your grandfather.  It is not her fault that she had to break ties to protect her mental health, and family from his abuse.  While it is wonderful that you went above and beyond to be with a bigot in his twilight years, do you really believe that if you were gay he would have treated you as he did when you came home from the war? In that light is it really fair to say that your sister has no right to anything at all from the estate? You state yourself that you did not agree with his views yet you are supporting them by excluding her like he did from his legacy.

Questions for OP to consider - Do you feel if grandpa was more loving toward your sister she would\u2019ve been in his life? Did he break ties with her with his hate not vice versa? Is picking you as his sole beneficiary in some way also a fuck you to family members who did not conform to his way of being? By denying your sister some form of acknowledgment of this fact are you being a tool of this hate? How can you counteract this flawed part of grandpa? Ethically, I would think back to all the time I spent with him, and I would break down what part involved him shit talking LGBTQ people and how much importance these beliefs held to him - and I would consider that percentage ill gotten gains and I would take that percentage and do something with it that would make grandpa\u2019s head explode.", "There was a vaguely similar AITA post a few weeks ago where a grandson inherited the family property because (1) he was the only male descendent of the grandfather, (2) he helped to maintain the property, and (3) he was the only one who agreed with/tolerated his grandfather's bigoted and outdated views: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkaxz0/aita_for_refusing_to_allow_my_families_property/ \n\nA few things stand out between that situation and this one:\n\n1.

Maybe the inheritance money wouldn\u2019t matter to some people that cut out toxic relatives but it matters to her. We all deal with our trauma differently, and clearly having her sibling recognize the really unfair hand she was dealt in life matters to her. It\u2019s not about the grandfather.

Do you think he would have left her any money despite her being gay no matter what else she did?  **He favored you because you're a straight, male vet and penalized your sister for being a gay, female civilian**.  If you hadn't visited at all, I bet he still would have left all that money to you.\n\nYou keep trying to frame it differently, but even you admit **you gave him company because it helped you**.  You got all the help and support while your sister got the abuse and now you think that you should receive all the money because you received all the support.", "The framing op gives, seems to me very one sided. It frames the sister as being the one who severed ties with the grandfather for being homophobic. What people need to understand is that when a family members hates you and your spouse, not for anything you\u2019ve done but simply for who you are, that is them severing ties with you - not the other way around. \nOPs sister never had a real chance to have a relationship with the grandfather not because of any action she did but because of the grandfather\u2019s bigotry.\n\nSecondly OP has to ask himself if the reason he got money and the sister didn\u2019t is because he put the work in (a narrative that frames him as deserving of the money in a meritocratic sense) or if it was because he is straight and his sister is gay (a narrative that means he got the money not because of anything himself or his sister did or didn\u2019t do, but simply because of sexual identity). In that case your sister is more a victim of bigotry than she is someone who didn\u2019t put the time in. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is or isn\u2019t an asshole. He related to the non-homophobic parts of his grandpa and was able to compartmentalize away the parts that were. His sister understandably couldn\u2019t do that. \n\nI would just say to OP to try and see from your sister\u2019s perspective how she was effectively starting from a place that made having an equivalent relationship to her grandfather as you did way more difficult. If you value your relationship with your sister and don\u2019t want it permanently ruined over money I would split the inheritance.

I understand the connection you shared with your grandfather. I have a loved one who's a combat vet and I've seen his struggle.

I don't know why some people see bad things and come back unchanged, some people come back and live on the streets for the rest of their lives, and most fall somewhere in between. I do hope that you have a support group/therapy available to you. This is not to say there's anything wrong with you, but you've been through a very real thing, and I hope you know you're not alone. Regarding your sister, she never had the opportunity to provide end-of-life care to your grandfather. She'll never know what kind of relationship they would have had because his bigotry robbed her of that. She is still his granddaughter though, and I think it's an ah move to not share the money with her. Plus, sharing the money is the ultimate end-the-generational curse move.

I hope there are memories your sister can look back on and smile. He hurt your sister, she did not hurt your grandfather. He choose politics over loving her and that is incredibly painful. Your sister deserves to love whoever she wants and she didn\u2019t deserve to be treated poorly for loving someone. \n\nInheritance is what sets people up to have a successful future.

Common decency would be for OP to share a portion of the money. \n\nLike you, my conscience would really bother me if I didn't share a windfall!", "OP said she wouldn\u2019t have received the money due to her sexuality, even if she didn\u2019t cut him off.", "I highly recommend you read through OP's comments on their post history. I was all for N-T-A until they started showing their true colors in comments.", "$50,000 is a lot of money to some people. Consider yourself fortunate if it is not a lot to you.", "Thank you! I walked out of the relationship with my father KNOWING I was also walking away from any kind of inheritance. I dont expect my siblings to share any of it.", "\"Different views?\"\n\nTell me you're a homophobe without telling me you're a homophobe.", "It\u2019s not a childish move when you\u2019re dealing with homophobia\u2026 what kind of take is that you weirdo???\n\nEdit to add: OP is TA\u2026 Everyone defending this is the asshole. Pay the sister her dues, and hope to god she is better off with it and cuts OP out. Us queer people go through enough, we don\u2019t need bigoted old people giving money to those who say nothing and then act offended when we point out the injustices.", "\"Different views\"?\n\nHe's not talking about Red Sox vs Yankees or whether the toilet paper flap should be over or under, they're disagreeing on whether or not gay people deserve human rights. Jesus Christ, dude. \n\nAnd if we're going by your logic, what about the grandfather? Is his not tolerating his granddaughter's views not also childish? \n\nTolerating intolerance is weak and gross. Maybe you should be less childish and learn how to make tough choices- because that's being an adult.", "Unless stated somewhere in the comments, SHE cut off contact with the grandfather. \n\nOn top of that, it was the grandfather's money to disperse to whomever he decided. Maybe she would have received half if she actually tried to be involved.", "No, I wouldn't, but then again, I wouldn't go around demanding their money after they passed either. If you cut ties then you cut all and don't make a fuss when you are left out.", "This. It\u2019s a wee bit hypocritical to want nothing to do with someone until they die and suddenly you want their stuffs.", "This is what being old has to do with it.  His grandfather was more than 20 years older than I am, and I am old enough to remember when it was generally understood that LGBTIA+ were in some way defective.   The disgust and hatred actually extended to sometimes literally allowing men to get away with murder if they managed to convincingly claim that a gay man propositioned them.  (We didn't hear so much about women)   A gay auteur did a POV about people who got jailed for attacking  gay people.   Some of them admitted that they targeted gay men for robberies or violence because they could get away with it.   While a lot of people were more compassionate, and wouldn't have dreamed of harming them, they still often thought that they were defective.   I can remember when gay and lesbian people would sometimes denounce bisexuals as actual homosexuals who thought that by selling out and claiming to be bisexual, they could lessen the stigma.\n\nThe point is, that just because all good, especially younger, liberal people have gotten the memo, it doesn't mean that all people suddenly change.  Scientific theories often replace older ones not by convincing the leaders of the field, but because younger scientists are convinced of the new ideas, and as they say, funeral by funeral, science advances.   Expecting that people will change ideas that they have held for decades isn't realistic.   Expecting that all younger people will give up older ideas isn't realistic, as conservatives, and groups like the Westboro Baptist Church demonstrate.  I'm not saying it's good, I'm saying that it's true.\n\nAdded: I'm also not much of a one issue person.  I don't think that OP necessarily had to rob himself of the benefits of talking to another veteran, and one that he may have family feeling for, because they didn't align on all their views.   This something that I get into with friends a lot.   I know that they think that their views are a seamless garment, I prefer to take issues one by one.   One of my friends used to argue with me, until I told her that I won't talk to her if she can't be civil, about something that she sees as one issue and I see as three.   I pointed out to her, to her complete surprise, that what I consider to be issue 1, which I think that we would agree is the most important, has 80% public support whereas the other 2 only have about 50%.  Has she considered that working on that one first, might get her further than demanding all three or nothing?\n\nSorry, I have never learned to be brief."]}
