I would visit 1-2 times a month to check in on him, play cards, bring him on walks etc. The main reason for these visits was because when I was at the lowest point in my life after getting home from deployment my grandfather was always there to listen and talk with me. We were both combat veterans so he understood me on a level other people couldn\u2019t. Here is where the problem lies, my grandfather held a lot of extreme viewpoints that I did not agree with, more specifically against the LGBTQ+ community. I resented my grandpa for these views and called him out whenever he would say something inappropriate, I was very close to ending the visits because of these views but decided against it for reasons discussed prior. My sister (28 F) is happily married to a woman (31 F) and therefore obviously cut off contact with my grandfather, my sister and I have a very good relationship in general but would frequently fight over my continued relationship with my grandpa. When he passed away and left me the money I did not think there would be any argument over it as my sister wanted nothing to do with him (understandably so).However when she found out about it she demanded that she should receive half of the money, I was shocked and basically told her no way as she was not the one who had been visiting and providing care for him for the last 5 years. My sister was visibly angry and we have not been on speaking terms since, This has left me wondering wether I am the AH as my sister was a victim of my grandfathers bigotry, however I don\u2019t think half the money is a reasonable request.

Honestly I think YTA if you don\u2019t give her at least a little (but not necessarily half).\n\nLet\u2019s think about this in practical terms - yes you\u2019re the only one that visited, and normally I\u2019d say yes keep it all. But the reason your sister didn\u2019t visit is because she is LGBTQ+, how can you realistically expect her to uphold a relationship with a man that hates who she is? And if he made those comments enough for you to call him out on it, I can\u2019t imagine your sister would have got away unscathed if she had visited.\n\nNo, she doesn\u2019t have the right to demand any money, *technically* it is all yours.

Here\u2019s an interesting thought exercise (just a thought exercise\u2026don\u2019t actually do this). What do you think sister would do if you said you decided to donate half the money to an LGBT org? Would she be happy with that, or would she still demand you give her the money? I suspect the latter.\n\nI am estranged from an abusive relative. If he left me any money I would decline to accept or immediately donate it to a women\u2019s shelter or something. If he left me nothing I would actually be relieved. That\u2019s why I suspect sister would still want the money.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Half the money is a bit extreme considering she put in no effort and you sacrificed 1-2 days/week for 5 years. I may offer some to keep the peace, as she was subject to bigotry by his words and could offer some consolation for her pain and suffering. However, this is another classic case of \"money tearing families apart\" and it's really up to her if she wants to let greed come between her relationship with her brother. NTA OP, sorry you're in this position. You are every bit entitled to this money.", "NTA. It's your grandfathers last will. Even if he had some questionable Views, it should be respected. I don't blame your sister for resenting your Grandfather and cutting ties with him for that, but demanding half of his money just because they are related is an AH Move for sure.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t deserve anything. She left. That means she gave up on everything to do with him. I get his views were wrong but regardless it was his money and he got to choose what he wanted to do with it. And if she is easily willing to give up on you too over something so fickle then that says a lot about her character", "NTA\n\nYou didn't spend time with him for the money and you also didn't allow him to say bigoted things to you unchecked. \n\nYou had your own, understandable reasons for the connection and your sister gave you a hard time for it while he was living. She showed no empathy for why you needed him in your life because she felt her grievances against him were more important.\n\nIf you cut someone out of your life, no matter how valid your reasons are for doing so, you cannot expect something from them when they're gone.", "Tentive NTA, your sister didn't really have a choice about visiting your grandfather, I mean how could she? He literally hated a part of her and it isn't a lifestyle its who she is, not sure why so many people yourself included are holding this against her.\n\nIt is your money but remember it's only yours because your grandfather literally hated your sister because of something she had no say in.

On the one hand, sis has no claim to the money as she wasn\u2019t there for him. Under normal circumstances I\u2019d call her an AH for expecting you to share. \nOn the other hand, she had very good reason not to be there for him and to feel sort of betrayed by you for supporting him. And considering his views he likely still wouldn\u2019t have given her anything if she had supported him because the real AH in all this is him.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe her anything but you need to accept that the effort on your part didn\u2019t remotely compare to the effort it would\u2019ve been for her to do the same.

We the internet can't judge that but I bet you could if you were honest.  You made an extraordinary effort to provide support to him, and have been rewarded.  If you have good reason to think your sister would have done the same, then maybe you could give her some.  But in my experience it is rare to find anyone going so out of their way as you did.", "NTA. Your sister has no reason to get involved with your grandfather's choice. Don't feel back your doing g nothing wrong. Sorry you are going through this after losing your grandfather.", "Nta and your sister obviously wanted nothing to do with him which was completely warranted.  \ud83d\ude44  . However people always have lots to say when money is involved .", "On the one hand, it was your grandfather's decision and you can honor it. On the other, if you uphold his cutting off your sister you are upholding the same bigotry he supported that drove her away. Self-respect says that's inappropriate (as you say). \n\nHonestly, I would share at least a fifth/quarter with her. It's not completely A H territory, but you will probably lose a relationship with your sister if you share nothing. Is that a consequence you're okay with?", "NAH - I don't think you're an asshole, but I think your sister's request is reasonable and you should split the money.\n\nYour grandfather shunned your sister because of her sexual preferences. She may have wanted to have a relationship with him, but he made it clear that he was unable to accept her. You say that you recognise how awful this was and resented it and nearly ended your visits. But in the end, you did carry on seeing your grandfather for other reasons. Fine.\n\nHad your grandfather not been so bigoted, he would probably have split the inheritance between his grandchildren, but he gave it all to you because he didn't accept your sister. Now, you not sharing the inheritance looks like you are condoning and going along with his non-acceptance of your sister, even though you previously said your grandfather was wrong. It might even send the message that you agree with him. Splitting the money would not only be fairer but would demonstrate to your sister that you care about her.\n\nA 50/50 split would be the simplest way to go. If you find that difficult to stomach due to the hours you spent looking after him in his old age, then an unequal split might work. But if you insist on keeping all the money, then you should accept that it will damage your relationship with your sister forever. Is it worth it?", "NTA. I have no other insight.", "NTA.  Funny how once there\u2019s money involved, relatives come crawling out of the woodwork. Absolutely do not give her half as she\u2019s a hypocrite.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nI hate to say it like this, but your grandfather was raised in a different time. You are allowed to hate something about someone, but still love them. While reading this, I thought maybe she should get like 10k or even 5k. Ask yourself this - will you ever hear the end of it because it's not half? She already isn't talking to you because of the very conversation. Unfortunately, we can't make others think like us. Your grandfather gave you the money for a reason. He wanted to help you like you helped him. My final opinion is that the money is where it is supposed to be.", "INFO: did your grandfather *particularly* cause pain to your sister growing up? Was his homophobia direct, targeted, conspicuously aimed at your sister, or was it generally expressed to all and sundry & your sister cut off contact with a number of family members, including your grandfather? \n\nI think the answer to that would inform whether she has a moral case to receive some of the money.", "NTA. Demanding *any* would be absurd, but half is extreme. I completely understand why she'd feel being left with nothing is unfair, but it was his money and he left it how he saw fit. *If* you gave her any, that would be up to you and you alone. *If* you chose to share it with her, she better find some respect for you, and fast. You aren't obligated to give her any.", "\"Am I an AH\" and \"Am I allowed to do this, like legally\" are not mutually exclusive. You have no *obligation* to share this inheritance with your sister.\n\nHowever.\n\nYour grandfather has treated your sister horribly. His isolation and his loneliness from her is entirely *his own* doing. By giving the inheritance solely to you and excluding her, he is not making a point about the fact she didn't visit, because he's the one that couldn't behave well enough to be a safe person. \n\nShe was not neglectful - he was an AH jerk who expected to have the younger generation kiss up while he insulted and disrespected both her and her wife. Its him throwing one last temper-tantrum over the fact that *his* actions have consequences - not hers.  He is making a point that he will continue to demean and criticise who she is from beyond the grave. Its not an expression of love, its an expression of hate. \n\nYou were the golden grandchild and now reap the benefits from the fact she was a target rather than because of your own action. You can't control that anymore than you can change the type of person your grandfather was. But by keeping the the inheritance - its certainly your right, but it will mean that you will always appear to have supported your grandfather's homophobic views - especially when it was beneficial to you.\n\n\"Can I?\" Yes. \"Would I be an AH\", also yes; sorry bud.

He shut his grandfather down whenever he said something awful. \n\nHe was willing to listen *to non-homophobic subjects of conversation* because his grandfather had been there supporting him years before when he was in a bad mental place, and he felt that kindness deserved a return.", "I would say donate a portion to an LGBT+ org in your sisters name and inform her and her wife (make sure the wife knows too) of what you've done. That way you're making sure your grandpa's views are not honoured. As such, you don't owe money to your sis, but donating part feels like the right thing to do.", "Hold up, it was the grandfather who basically cut her off!!! How the hell was it expected for her to remain in contact when he literally hated a part of her. Being gay isn't a lifestyle its part of who she is. How the hell would it be easy money when someone she grew up loving suddenly turned on her because of who she loves?", "Grandpa's dead. And OP has every right to say where HIS money goes now. He has every right to disagree with grandpa's bigotry and support his sister. Or I guess, he could not do those things and keep it...", "Op literally says he called out his grandfather\u2019s bigotry, if you aren\u2019t willing to take OP\u2019s word on this, why even bother placing judgement? It isn\u2019t based on any reality of the situation at hand, at that point it just becomes irrelevant", "When you go nc with someone, like OP\u2019s sister did with their grandfather (for completely justified reasons) you cut all ties, you don\u2019t get to come back around with your hand out once they die\u2026 you have no entitlement to their property.", "Which human rights are being hurt by someone being an asshole?", "Haha, of course I understand that there is another view. All we can do here is take the OP at face value, we have no way to know whats really going on!", "That\u2019s ridiculous.", "In the post, op says the Sister cut off grandpa. \nAgain, we re not defending grandpa for his views. But when you go nc with someone it's nc.\nNot NC but after he dies get his money. She wanted nothing to do with him and he with her. So she doesn't deserve money.", "I mean... there's no complete list of agreed upon human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an example, but human rights as a concept predates that document. \n\nI think it's fair to call \"the right to dignity\" or \"respect\" a human right, no? \n\nArticle 1 of the Declaration: \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\"\n\nI don't thing someone being an AH is \"in the spirit of brotherhood\"", "Naw, see when someone you grow up loving and feeling love from all of a sudden decides you disgust them because of who you love then damn right she needed to go nc and actually yeah she deserves some compensation from the trauma she would have went through. Oh and don't forget some of that money may have been her grans.\n\nHave your opinion by all means but don't make out the sister actually had a choice in being able to continue contact.", "Say what? \nIf i go NC with my grandpa i want nothing to do with him. He can keep his Money too. She doesn't deserve a thing."]}
