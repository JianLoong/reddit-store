Your sister is. You're right. She needs to listen. She needs to let the kids talk to her in front of each other and hear them out without interruption and listen. Then, she needs to parent.", "Anyone else find it interesting that sister wanted op to take the child and see what was going on and then shutting it down immediately? Sometimes parents of multiples pick their favorite and can\u2019t see anything else. That 10yo is a problem. He only attracts the wrong crowd? You\u2019re the company you keep. Heller?! Poor other kids. Definitely NTA here, op.", "NTA That poor, (oldest), kid.\n\nYour sister is focusing on the \u201cyou shut up\u201d thing as a way to deflect from the truth of what you told her that she didn\u2019t like hearing.", "NTA - your sister is raising the youngest to be a total a$$hole who will get along with no one.  God help the older three having to live with the youngest.  Predict some LC/NC contacts from the older three in the future.", "Look, your sister isn't winning any parenting awards with how she clearly favours her younger child, and you weren't wrong that she needs to listen to her older instead of dismissing his concerns. But you haven't exactly handled this with tact and compassion either. Despite what you see in films, \"knocking some sense\" into people rarely works; when you scold someone they are more likely to dig in and dismiss what you said. You aren't an asshole, but you failed your nephew there.", "Nta I mean she needed to shut up and listen. Honestly if you guys can I'd see if you can just take the older one from now on", "NTA. At the least, the oldest will know that he has *someone* who will listen to him and will stand up for him. This is huge for a child! And you did right to be his advocate. Someone needed to stand up for him and tell your sister that what she was doing was hurting him. \n\nRight now, it sounds like so many people are so concerned about the 10 y/o struggles that the others are feeling neglected. I can only hope that, once your sister calms down, this will be a wake up call. Still, at the least, you can be a pillar of support for the oldest one.", "NAH she's doing what she thinks is right as a parent (regardless of whether it is or isn't) and you're just trying to help our your nephew cause it's obvious she's letting her youngest take their issues out on them and isn't doing anything about it.", "I don't think YTA but it definitely seems like you're 100% in the 13yo corner without ever hearing from the 10yo. It honestly kind of seems a bit like you're playing favourites. Even in your description you speak very highly of the 13yo but not so much with the 10yo. Not much to base this on so take it with a grain of salt.", "NTA.\n\nSounds to me like the 13 year old is getting to that age where he's starting to try and think and discover for himself, especially with mentions of how he's looking into different religions and playing around with different clothing styles. The 10 yo sounds like he may be jealous of his older brother based on your sister's description of him and is trying hard to get him down - and *succeeding enough* that he straight up needs a vacation from the family? Yea, that's something to keep in check.\n\nMain concern here is that in prioritizing both of their feelings, they're probably communicating that this age of discovery (which is very typical and to be expected for this age) for the 13 yo is unwelcome and unsupported which may only cause the 13 yo to hide more things from his family about what changes he is going through and what he is dealing with. Hell - it's worth wondering if the kid might be avoiding bringing up problems in other areas like in school because his family has already demonstrated that they aren't willing to listen to him when he has problems at home. Are they really sure the only problems the kid has are at home with his brother or is it just that the kid isn't encouraged to bring it up because his brother has so many problems and he gets shut down whenever he does bring something up?\n\nJust, you know, some things worth thinking about that you can probably bring up. You're right to tell them that they should listen to the oldest, especially now, because the reality is that not listening to him now will probably cost them the ability to know what is going on in the future.", "NTA for sure. Obviously the 10y/o needs a different type of attention, but not ALL the attention. \n\nMy younger sister was ever this cruel to me, but she did get a lot of the attention. In my case I don\u2019t think my parents had a clue. \n\nAnd its taking a lot of therapy for me to come to terms with why I rarely put myself first, and to still speak up when it literally never used to matter (you need to defend yourself with your sister, *defends self*, why would you do that to your sister?!).\n\nMy grandma used to stick up for me with my parents, and that\u2019s the role that you\u2019re playing right now with the 13y/o and I applaud you for being his advocate when no one else will! \n\nKeep being his person, so he knows he has someone to turn to. He should probably be in therapy right now, but I doubt mom will let him. \n\nMom can be all defensive, but in reality she really should just shut up.", "NTA\nShe asked YOU to take her eldest in for a week and figure out what is going on, and when you do, she doesn't want to know. Right, grounding is probably not going to help, but letting the complicated kid bully the easy kid isn't going to help either.", "Some words are almost guaranteed to make someone stop listening. Shut up is one of them. It was good of you to try. ESH a little.", "NAH, but I think as soon as you tell someone to shut up, that\u2019s all they hear and are defensive after that, hope it works out for the boys!

All you can do now is be there for the 13 year old when he needs you, and try to keep your head down when the 10 year old spins completely out of control because your sister is too conflict-avoidant to provide her son with the boundaries and discipline he needs to become a socially functional adult. I pity the 13 year old, and I pity the 10 year old more.", "He probably also wants to protect the twins knowing it\u2019s only a matter of time before his mom finds excuses when the 10yo starts bullying them", "I agree. Both kids deserve compassion here. The people painting this 10 year old and the mom as \u201cproblems\u201d don\u2019t really know enough to know what living in his shoes are like. Sounds like the 13 yo is a \u201cstar\u201d kind of kid and that it\u2019s hard for the 10 year old. Siblings of the same gender in different positions in the family are often very different from each other. The second kid is sometimes rebelling against the more adult-pleasing first child. This kid is sandwiched between a star older child and twin little brothers. The mom is understandably concerned for him. The 13 year old deserves some compassion from the mom but OP doesn\u2019t know everything and is only advocating for the one nephew she spent a week with."]}
