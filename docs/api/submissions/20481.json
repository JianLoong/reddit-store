I don't think he's an asshole, per se, but I can see why she's a bit thrown to learn that her daughter has the same name as her husband's ex, well after the point of no return.\n\nWhen I was pregnant, my husband and I finally whittled our name list down to three, and as we were choosing between X Y and Z, I mentioned that (in the spirit of full disclosure) he should know that I dated an X for a while in college.  It didn't end up being a big deal at all - it's a common name that at this point has no real emotional resonance for me, and it's the name we ended up picking, but I can imagine it would feel crappy to put 2 and 2 together down the road.", "I feel like he was in a bad position because she wanted her named after someone she loved.  So I'd probably not tell her either because it's some insignificant thing from high schools\n\nI'm a woman. I just feel like both of them were fucked the second she said she wanted that name. It's not like they were working on a list. It just popped out of her mouth. He reacted kindly. No matter what he did, it would have been wrong.", "If he loved X more than his wife, he would have stayed with X...", "Wait they divorced and you were adopted out instead of staying with one of them?

It\u2019s baseline advice for how to communicate and resolve conflict with basically anyone. \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t cost thousands of dollars in counselling to get this sort of advice.

And no, I don't think this is really a big \"crime.\" But the wife is clearly pissed that she heard it from someone other than OP. He didn't need to approach her like he was defusing a bomb - but he should have told her before one of his buddies did.\n\nIt's kind of like if your partner had a one-night stand with somebody in their friend group prior to dating you, and never told you about it.
