She just found out that her daughter\u2019s name is the name of an ex (and her brain is probably not allowing her to focus on the \u201chigh school\u201d part). She probably feels foolish and embarrassed. After all, she chose the name not knowing that it was an ex\u2019s name and that information was revealed to her by one of your friends. She probably feels blindsided. \n\nYou on the other hand didn\u2019t want to ruin a very special moment by mentioning a meaningless ex-girlfriend immediately after your wife just gave birth. I totally understand that as well. \n\nMy husband and I were in the same friend group in high school. He once said something *really* stupid that hurt my feelings. He didn\u2019t mean it at the time, but I still remembered it years later. \n\nWhen I mentioned it to him, he was shocked that I held on to such a stupid little comment\u2026but he also empathized with me and said, \u201cYeah, that probably made you feel like shit, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThat one statement really allowed me to lower my defenses.

You were under no obligation to mention that you dated a girl of the same.name when you were 15 or 16 years old.

Who even names their daughter \"X\" !?", "NTA, if the relationship wasn't important to you this is not a big deal.", "NTA the name was your wife's idea named after her grandmother. It's irrelevant if you dated someone a long time ago with the same name.

So your wife is overreacting a bit.\n\nThat being said, I don't believe you \"honestly forgot\" that you dated a girl with that name. Unless it was one date and even then...come on.  When your wife originally asked you should have casually thrown that info out, she likely would have been OK with it but is upset now because of the blindside from your friend.", "NTA-having dated someone with that name shouldn\u2019t make the name off limits.

This girl was so insignificant you forgot she existed, but your friends remember her?", "NTA, weird take from your wife here.", "YTA but that's not the point on who's wrong or right. Birth and  babies are so special beyond words and I understand the excitement and joy in that moment, like you didn't want to interrupt that moment but I think you could have told her, at least before registering the name, by including that the ex doesn't mean anything to you now of course and her grandma's name is all that matters? It's true that your wife's reactions can seem too much right now but I  dont think it will last or that she loves you less, she maybe feels a little betrayed at the fact that you hid such detail from her. She'll be alright I think but right now a bit of empathy and you being there could go a long way. Once she understands that her grandma and her joy was more important than that ex and that you're regretful for hiding this detail from her, it'll be ok.\n\nJust my opinion, all the best and I hope all goes well \ud83d\udc4d(from 1 woman's perspective)", "soft yta simply because she had to find out through your friends telling her, had you told her by yourself whenever you remembered there would be nah", "Maybe a mild YTA because you did remember at the time your wife thought of the name that it was the name of your ex. You should've spoken up. She might well have just shrugged it off. Now it seems as if you were keeping it from her. \n\nStill, I think she's overreacting a bit. You could ask her, if it comes up again, had she known it was the name of one of your ex's, would she have said no to using the name? It's the still the name of her great grandmother.", "YTA. The only time I tell people my sister and I are named after women he dated is when I'm giving examples of how much of an ass my dad was.\n\nEdited we to he", "NTA but your wife is allowed to be a bit irritated as well. it's OK to allow her to cool down a bit but it might be good to empathize instead / as well.", "YTA.
