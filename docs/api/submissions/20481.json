So he rolls with it, because the ex is hardly a memory to him, and it meant so much to her.\n\nNow they're out of the hospital. The baby's name is on the birth certificate. Sure, many places allow you a 'freebie' name change within X days, but plenty of people don't know that, and they have enough on their plate at home. Does he bring it up to her then? The way he sees it, the cat's out of the bag and the bag's in the river. Name's been given, mom loves it, dad doesn't really care about some decade old high school fling.\n\nIt took a friend visiting to clumsily throw out the ex association to make this an issue - *4 years after the birth!* \n\nEnd of the day, this was just an incredibly unfortunate sequence of events that could have been entirely avoided with a simple name discussion when they found out wife was pregnant. \n\n> imagine your discomfort if it had been a boy, and you found out the same.\n\nThat's going to depend wholly on how much weight a random high school relationship carries for each individual person.", "Lol how?", "What the absolute fuck?\n\nIt was a non-serious girlfriend from high school when he was FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. \n\nYou need a reality check, your response is absurd.\n\nNTA op, there's literally no reason for your side to be upset about this", ">your wife will think you named your kid after an ex forever\n\nHow the hell would the wife think he named the kid after an ex when *she suggested the name?!?*", "Wasn't op who told her.

She could have mulled it over for a couple of days in the hospital, and decided to keep it. Instead, a man thought he knew better, took that choice from her forever, and she was blindsided years later, without any preparation. If the girl was no big deal, then why keep that info from her and just hope she doesn\u2019t find out? \n\nKeeping information like this secret, or lying, is a great way to get a divorce. \n\nFor all you know, that girl was the one who got away and he was thrilled to name his baby that name.

SHE should have been given the courtesy to decide if she still wanted to use the name, since it\u2019s the same as an ex. She would have had 3 days to think about it, before the birth certificate had to be completed. She might very well have decided to keep the name. \n\nThat choice, however, was taken from her forever by a man who thought he knew better. \n\nThere are entire threads on this forum about men deliberately naming their children after exes. Yes, she suggested the name, but his keeping from her that it\u2019s the name of his ex now has to wonder if that\u2019s why he liked it. \n\nGetting blindsided, 4 years later, that your baby has the same name as your husband\u2019s ex, and that he deliberately kept it from you, is not good. \n\nHence why she\u2019s mad.
