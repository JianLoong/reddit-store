Am I supposed to list all of them to her?", "I'm really curious what you think the issue is if it isn't jealousy.", "Yeah people never think of names on the spot. Ever. At all.", "I can agree with that... they should have chosen a list of baby names long before the baby was ready to arrive. No one should ever choose a baby's name at the last moment.", "It's really a matter of your damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. You're right in bringing it up is weird because it makes it seem like he still thinks about his ex. But the alternative was what happened to the OP. He was fucked either way.", "The start of my relationship with my husband had so many pitfalls. We were both very broken people who happened to find each other when we were both doing well, but getting into a committed relationship unearthed our baggage. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together over twenty years now. We worked our shit out, and the bulk of our relationship has been calm AF. \n\nWe both still have our issues, but it doesn\u2019t affect us, as such. \n\nThe key is that both people have to want to work on it. If only one does, you\u2019re fucked.", "Yeah. Can we just have a gen-ed class on how to be a human and do human things. That would be great. \n\nI took a remedial math class in high school that walked us through basic budgeting, how to purchase a home/car and what was in our budget if we had a certain job. People got pretty creative, buying castles in France. We learned how to do our taxes and fill out work tax information. Oh, and how much children cost, that was a big one. \n\nAnd the teacher wanted us to understand how shit works. Probably, honestly the only class in high-school that has helped me in life. And the rest of the time we would play bullshit with like 5 packs of cards.", "Would love it, but the politics involved in this would be insane (especially as an American). Think about how some religious factions would consider this!", "\u201cThis\u201d is the poor man\u2019s Reddit award \ud83e\udd72 I just want them to know I appreciate the time they took to write that comment because it was so well put and wise", "I once dated a girl named Athena and I really love the name and the meaning. If I ever have a daughter I'm naming her Athena. The ex took my heart and so I'm taking her name. It's not a fair trade though it's more like a consolation prize.", "C\u2019est vrai!", "Except she didn't? She named her daughter after her grandma, the one who raised her, not some random HS GF OP had a decade ago. Sorry, but this is a NTA. His wife is picking a fight and feeling \"Embarrassed\" that her daughters name is shared with more than one person? She is avoiding him now because of it? The top comment Sound's nice and all, but sometimes people need to not coddle and baby irrational behavior, because that's what it is. She is making a mountain out of a mole hill", "Y are you gae?", "People are completely unhinged when it comes to how insane they think it's appropriate to be about romantic jealousy.", "I have the same first name as my husband\u2019s ex. Our middle names are also very close. There was also a girl he dated for like 6 months with the same name. \n\nNo jealousy at all from me, just a bunch of Highlander jokes and little playful jabs at him for being attracted to women with the same name.", "Plus he was a ducking sophomore in high school lol. I don\u2019t think that really counts as an ex", "If your dad named you after an ex that's very different from this scenario. The child was named after OP's wife's great grandma, The wife chose the name. OP did not name his daughter after his 10th grade ex", "I agree with that, but I am sure he though why would a friend bring that up. That friend sucks", "This is so wholesome to see.", "Lmao I\u2019m sorry but in what religion is empathy discouraged?\n\nScience classes teach evolution and that the earth is round. People protesting sex education and healthy relationships can pipe down and homeschool, though I feel bad for their children. Problem with politicians is that they give too much attention to the loudest voices. \n\nI\u2019m from Ontario and the provincial government basically campaigned on removing the updated sex ed curriculum claiming they were going to do all sorts of parental consultation and set up a fucking SNITCH LINE for any teachers teaching the newer curriculum (which hadn\u2019t been updated since kids had cell phones) which the previous administration had already spent a ton of money on consulting, only to do their own repeated research, refuse to release it because it was in favour of the new curriculum, and then quietly allow the new one to be taught much later when no one cared or noticed anymore.\n\nThey also just rolled teaching cursive writing back out in the new elementary language curriculum claiming kids need more kinaesthetic learning and screens and keyboards are negatively impacting language learning, etc etc\u2026\u2026 a mere few years after trying to make it mandatory that all high school students take at least four of their courses online in order to graduate. A move which made zero sense, was designed solely to cut spending, eliminate teaching jobs, and outsource the programming to companies their buddies would run to make a profit, and which was supported by precisely zero research. And when teachers protested and went on strike, they blamed it on the teachers being greedy. And guess what? Just like last time\u2026 after drumming up all the public outrage they needed to stay in power\u2026 they quietly eliminated that requirement entirely. Again.\n\nOur education minister literally PUBLICLY STATED that he wanted to model the Ontario education system after one of the lowest-performing states in all of America. Why? Because they\u2019re also one of the lowest-spending states with one of the highest rates of private education.", "Ditto this!", "Yeah, I don\u2019t have any problem with it.", "First, what does this have to do with my comment? Is this a bot?\n\nSecond, this is the most cringey thing ever, wtf? Like, on so many levels. Talking like there\u2019s not going to be another person involved in the decision. Talking like everyone isn\u2019t gonna see you name her that and be like \u2018wtf, still clearly hung up on her.\u201d Such a bizarre display of pure petty grandiose ego\u2026 which doesn\u2019t match up with the fact that this would be a blow to your reputation?\n\nI had an ex like that, told me with such fucking confidence that he promised his grandfather on his deathbed that he would be naming his first son \u201cDoug.\u201d Like bro, what is this boys\u2019 club nonsense? First, what son are you going to spawn on your own where you have sole naming rights? Second, there\u2019s *already* a tradition that you get the last name. Third, what a *random ass thing* to unilaterally and solemnly declare to your dying grandparent. He didn\u2019t even *ask* you to, you just *vowed* this at random of your own accord? What in the reverse-Bridgerton is that?!\n\nI told him he shouldn\u2019t have made promises he couldn\u2019t keep, and good luck having a baby by himself.", "She\u2019s not being irrational, and nobody made a \u201cmountain\u201d.

You sure about that?", "This sub has a gender bias. The wife is being a dick. It\u2019s understandable to be angry, but he doesn\u2019t owe her any empathy for her anger.

She's not \"His Ex\", she's just \"An Ex\" IMO in order for her to have been \"His Ex\" she would have had to be a Wife, fianc\u00e9, or long term girlfriend of a decade.

And yes, I dislike \"this\" replies but I also dislike top comments that are not as empathetic as this top one and feel is fine to emphasize this.\n\nAlso, regarding discouraging \"this\" comments, as you say, that's what upvotes are for.

She needs to grow up, she has a kid now.", "Owes him an apology? Lmfao", "You speaking for everyone now? Lmao you\u2019re delusional. The only irrational one in this entire thing is you bud.", "Yeah, she owes him an apology. Her being upset she didn't know he dated a girl with that name once is looney tunes.
