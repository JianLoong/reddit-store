My stepson used to stay with us at the weekends but as he has to share a room with my daughters, he has decided he doesn't want to stay anymore (which is fair enough! He's getting older and wants space, plus he is getting too old to share now) I don't have a problem with this AT ALL! He needs to do what is is best for him and I'm not going to force him to come to my house all the time when he doesn't want it but he also doesn't want to spend any time here whatsoever.\n\nHe wants to spend all his time at his grandma's. Now we all went away last year, he had his own room and we had a relatively good time! I was planning on booking a holiday for the end of this year but I told my partner that I wasn't paying for SS to come with us as by the time we go, he would of spent zero time with the family and probably wouldn't enjoy coming away with us for a week as he doesn't enjoy being around my kids anymore and doesn't really like me.\n\n My partner threw a massive tantrum and said I was purposely leaving him out of stuff just to be spiteful but in reality, I'm the one who pays for everything I.e. the holiday, clothes, food, activities etc when we are away and I want to enjoy myself and let my kids enjoy it without ss moaning about being here in the first place (which he will and did the last time we went away) and I don't want to pay for someone who doesn't want to be here in the first place.\nAITA?

My stepson used to stay with us at the weekends but as he has to share a room with my daughters, he has decided he doesn't want to stay anymore (which is fair enough! He's getting older and wants space, plus he is getting too old to share now) I don't have a problem with this AT ALL! He needs to do what is is best for him and I'm not going to force him to come to my house all the time when he doesn't want it but he also doesn't want to spend any time here whatsoever. He wants to spend all his time at his grandma's. Now we all went away last year, he had his own room and we had a relatively good time! I was planning on booking a holiday for the end of this year but I told my partner that I wasn't paying for SS to come with us as by the time we go, he would of spent zero time with the family and probably wouldn't enjoy coming away with us for a week as he doesn't enjoy being around my kids anymore and doesn't really like me. My partner threw a massive tantrum and said I was purposely leaving him out of stuff just to be spiteful but in reality, I'm the one who pays for everything I.e. the holiday, clothes, food, activities etc when we are away and I want to enjoy myself and let my kids enjoy it without ss moaning about being here in the first place (which he will and did the last time we went away) and I don't want to pay for someone who doesn't want to be here in the first place.\nAITA?

The feelings of resentment will still fester.", "Depends on their relationship.  That is something that they decide. I'm not staying that she has to pay.  But he is her responsibility just as her kids are her boyfriend's.  That is called PARENTING. I'm not talking about the vacation, I'm talking in life.  I would not pay for everything, but OP had decided that she is okay with that.  In fact,  OP defends her boyfriend and his lack of fiscal responsibility in her comments. She is okay with essentially parenting her boyfriend as he just can't adult. Those are her choices. SS is a child. She is not.  You don't get to be a parent when it is convenient.  OP either needs to get the boyfriend in line,  leave, or accept what she has chosen and start acting as a parent to a child that she is responsible for.  In my opinion, both OP and the boyfriend are trash. For this, as well as the benefits fraud she admitted to in comments.", "I read that to mean *while on the trip*.", "Gotcha.

I\u2019m not defending OP but it seems like a massive leap for you to be accusing her of benefit fraud just because she still goes on vacations.

He is not the one paying for the vacation, OP is. Someone else claimed that OP is on government benefits that covers their housing, if that\u2019s true then dad already isn\u2019t paying for housing. He needs to step up and provide for his son instead of expecting his wife to do it all for him when she already has multiple children of her own to provide for. I know Reddit has a hard on for fully blended families where the step parents are seen as and have the same responsibilities as the actual parents do, but that is not the only or even the most common type of blended family.

At 12? Surely you meant the dad, right?\n\nAnyway, I agree that the dad should be doing more.
