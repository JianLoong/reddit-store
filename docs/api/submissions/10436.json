My stepson used to stay with us at the weekends but as he has to share a room with my daughters, he has decided he doesn't want to stay anymore (which is fair enough! He's getting older and wants space, plus he is getting too old to share now) I don't have a problem with this AT ALL! He needs to do what is is best for him and I'm not going to force him to come to my house all the time when he doesn't want it but he also doesn't want to spend any time here whatsoever.\n\nHe wants to spend all his time at his grandma's. Now we all went away last year, he had his own room and we had a relatively good time! I was planning on booking a holiday for the end of this year but I told my partner that I wasn't paying for SS to come with us as by the time we go, he would of spent zero time with the family and probably wouldn't enjoy coming away with us for a week as he doesn't enjoy being around my kids anymore and doesn't really like me.\n\n My partner threw a massive tantrum and said I was purposely leaving him out of stuff just to be spiteful but in reality, I'm the one who pays for everything I.e. the holiday, clothes, food, activities etc when we are away and I want to enjoy myself and let my kids enjoy it without ss moaning about being here in the first place (which he will and did the last time we went away) and I don't want to pay for someone who doesn't want to be here in the first place.\nAITA?

My stepson used to stay with us at the weekends but as he has to share a room with my daughters, he has decided he doesn't want to stay anymore (which is fair enough! He's getting older and wants space, plus he is getting too old to share now) I don't have a problem with this AT ALL! He needs to do what is is best for him and I'm not going to force him to come to my house all the time when he doesn't want it but he also doesn't want to spend any time here whatsoever. He wants to spend all his time at his grandma's. Now we all went away last year, he had his own room and we had a relatively good time! I was planning on booking a holiday for the end of this year but I told my partner that I wasn't paying for SS to come with us as by the time we go, he would of spent zero time with the family and probably wouldn't enjoy coming away with us for a week as he doesn't enjoy being around my kids anymore and doesn't really like me. My partner threw a massive tantrum and said I was purposely leaving him out of stuff just to be spiteful but in reality, I'm the one who pays for everything I.e. the holiday, clothes, food, activities etc when we are away and I want to enjoy myself and let my kids enjoy it without ss moaning about being here in the first place (which he will and did the last time we went away) and I don't want to pay for someone who doesn't want to be here in the first place.\nAITA?

It hurts his dad's feelings sometimes, but we respect his choices (my husband picks him up every day after school, btw, and is not an absentee father, never has been.)

Ultimately, though, he is a great kid. \n\nNever, EVER have I considered excluding him from any family outing or trip I have planned. He is always given an invitation to come along and he knows he is welcome at our house anytime. It is his house, regardless of who he lives with the majority of the time.
