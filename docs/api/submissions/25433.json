We decided to forego spending money on a wedding or a honeymoon and instead got a cute (but very old lol) house.\n\nMy sister Jenna (30f) and her husband separated a few months back, and she\u2019s been staying with us until she can get back on her feet.\n\nThings were mostly fine in the beginning, I\u2019ve never had issues with my sister before, and she\u2019s always liked Andrew so I never thought there would be any problems.\nAndrew and I have always been a snuggly couple. It\u2019s nothing over the top, just forehead kisses, hand holding, and arm hugging mostly. I will admit that now that I\u2019m pregnant (due in late dec), Andrew has been way more snuggly.\n\nIf he\u2019s not fixing something in the house, sitting at his computer working, or running an errand, then he\u2019s probably either touching my belly or thinking about doing it lol. He\u2019s excited about being a dad and I think it\u2019s really sweet so I don\u2019t mind.\n\nJenna has been passive aggressive about it since he started doing it. She\u2019ll roll her eyes in annoyance or make a bit of a dramatic show of leaving the room. It\u2019s honestly been annoying but Andrew and I have mostly just ignored it.\n\nLast night when I was curled up on the couch not feeling well, Andrew brought me a drink, kissed my forehead, and then touched my belly while jokingly scolding our baby for making me sick. Jenna kind of huffed, but she waited until Andrew went back to putting some furniture together in the other room before she told me that I needed to stop being such an insensitive jerk by \u201cflaunting\u201d my happy marriage in her face.\n\nI told her I was sorry that she\u2019s going through a tough time in her own marriage, but I\u2019m flaunting anything and it\u2019s not like Andrew and I were doing it to antagonize her. She said we were being inconsiderate and that as long as she\u2019s staying at the house we need to keep our affections confined to our bedroom.\n\nFinally I said that it was *our* home, so I wouldn\u2019t be asking my husband to only act affectionate towards me behind closed doors, and that if it really was that difficult for her to see us together then maybe she'd be better off staying somewhere else.\n\nWell that upset her because she packed some of her stuff up and left shortly afterwards. Today I\u2019ve been getting all kinds of messages from our mom saying how cruel it was of me to toss Jenna out, and I got a message from Jenna saying she still can\u2019t believe how insensitive I\u2019m being about this.\n\nAndrew has assured me that I wasn\u2019t being cruel or insensitive about any of it, but I still feel unsure so I wanted to get some opinions from people who are removed from the situation.\n\nETA:\n\nI just wanted to answer a few questions I keep seeing.\n\nJenna was staying with my husband and I instead of our mom because we have more space at our house than our mom does in hers. It's also a shorter commute to Jenna's job from here, so it was for convenience but I do want to make a point of saying that I love my sister and I wanted to be there for her while she was going through her separation.\n\nShe was also made aware that I was pregnant almost a month before she started staying with us. I found out really early on and she was the second person I told.\n\nI'm also not a huge fan of excessive displays of affection in front of others, and so I didn't really think that Andrew and I had crossed a line or been \"overly\" affectionate in her presence.", "created_utc": 1692916061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160genc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_should_stay_with/", "score": 1935, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is clearly jealous because of her own failed marriage and is taking it out on you, but you and your husband (or any couple for that matter) should always tone down PDA when there are other people around. I have a single friend and whenever she visits my house for the weekend my husband and I tone down the PDA. I don\u2019t do this because she asked, I do it because I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m rubbing my relationship in her face; I would be especially careful if she had just gotten out of one. That being said, she is staying with you long term, so I think you guys need to find a middle ground where everyone is a little more comfortable. I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep from cuddling in my own living room with my husband for a month, so you guys just gotta find a way to coexist together. I do think her request for no PDA at all is ridiculous, but she\u2019s your sister and I know you aren\u2019t actively trying to hurt her feelings, but she is hurting right now too. I think you two will be able to work things out with a level headed conversation.", "NTA. I actually might have trended towards a \"light NTA\" because of the fact that Jenna's mental state clearly is a bit shaky right now, but she then went and wildly misrepresented the situation to your mother even after having some time to cool down, so forget it.

Ofcourse your sister is going through a tough time.  It's natural that there would be some level of contention seeing where your relationship with your husband is at compared to hers.  Yet in this instance you're sister needs to be an adult and get over herself.  You and your husband are going out of your way to be there and support her.  Anybody with any common decency would know that if somebody opens their door for you, especially in a time of need, you do your best to not interrupt their everyday lives.  She's actually being the insensitive one of you ask me.  The fact that she's disregarding the beautiful and special time you and your husband are in is beyond insensitive.

I think it's just hard for her to deal with seeing you too being so happy and your family growing and hers just crumbled.

Unless she has kids and you didn't mention it. If she does it's just the affection that she doesn't have.\n\nThat's is an explanation but you don't need to change what you are doing Infront of her because your not doing anything excessive neither is your husband.

Sometimes there are conception issues, losses and such that aren't shared. Even if she doesn't want them their biological clocks screw with their brains. \n\nThe most important thing to recognize here is that while all of these things are legitimately hurting her, and nothing you have said leads me to believe she is just a horrible person who wants to drag you down, these things are NOT your fault. \n\nYou can not and more importantly should not modify your behavior at this point to accommodate her. It has been proven that interaction with your child while still in the womb does have an impact when it comes to bonding. \n\nThe chemicals that your body produces while you are pregnant that encourage the mother-child bond are increased and a healthier relationship is created when mom has the added dopamine and \"happy hormones\" coursing through her body as a result of a happy marriage (aka being a happier human in general).\nAdditionally though, each time he touches you, it electrifies and invigorates your body and baby feels that too \ud83d\ude42 those things are precious and you should never give that up. \n\nIf you lessen your interactions to accommodate your sister's feelings, you will be doing so at the detriment of your own (and baby's) happiness. \nNo matter how much you love your sister, that's simply not a compromise you can make. \n\nIf you explain it like that to your mom, and she doesn't understand or refuses to see the importance, then you may have to choose to tell her that this is not up for further discussion. \nYou want all regular communication, visits, and your mother-daughter relationship to remain unchanged, but this topic is now off the table. \n\nAs for your sister, you can try to explain it to her delicately the same way. Depending on how combative or logical of a person she is, you can do that as a call, or text if you think she won't let you get it all out. \n\nI personally would go one step further, and tell her that she is welcome to come back as long as she drops the issue and all passive-aggressive behavior. If she can't do that, you will continue to be here as a sister to support her through this situation, simply not in your house. \n\nIf she chooses to come back, make yourself very clear that this is a one-chance, no warnings or further discussion, if she behaves that way again, she leaves immediately and permanently. \n\nYour pregnancy journey is going to go by so fast, then before you know it baby is born, baby is a toddler and life is speeding by. \nYou don't have the time, energy, or headspace for someone who is bringing you down during that process, no matter what they are going through.", "[removed]", "NTA and please tell your mother what actually happened.

But it you have close relationships with your family, be there for your hurting sister.", "Is it some kind of cultural thing in the US that you always call Mommy if someone annoys you, even if you are like 30? Because there seems to be a pattern in nearly every post here.", "NTA.\n\nIf she doesn't like how your house runs she is welcome to leave. You are 100% in the right here.", "Still NTA even if OP tossed her out. It\u2019s her and her husband\u2019s home. Anyone making them feeling uncomfortable is not welcome.", "Also, just a side note. Pregnancy can make our partners a little \"Handsier\" than normal because we are carrying their child, it's biology. That said, even if he is being more affections than his \"usual,\" it still doesn't sound like OP and Hubby are over the top with the PDA.\n\nSister definitely sounds jealous, which is also understandable given her recent divorce but it's a bit entitled of her to demand people around her hold back their affection for their loved ones.", "Even if they were over the top,  it's their house...", "NTA. \n\nPlease get ring camera for your home for security purposes. Jealous is a strong emotion that has led family members into committing hideous crimes. \n\nCongratulations \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf7e", "Loves..\nThink That's the word you looking for \u263a \ud83d\ude4f \ud83c\udf38", "NTA for your interaction with your sister. Not everyone who loves each other can live together.\n\nBut YTA for talking about your sister to your husband. You are setting them up to dislike each other. Your sister made her comments misguided as they were to you, not your husband. Of course he would agree with you.\n\nHonestly other people's PDA can be annoying. I think your sister is being extra but once you sort out the living situation you will be fine.\n\nGood luck with your growing family."]}
