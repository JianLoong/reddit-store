We decided to forego spending money on a wedding or a honeymoon and instead got a cute (but very old lol) house.\n\nMy sister Jenna (30f) and her husband separated a few months back, and she\u2019s been staying with us until she can get back on her feet.\n\nThings were mostly fine in the beginning, I\u2019ve never had issues with my sister before, and she\u2019s always liked Andrew so I never thought there would be any problems.\nAndrew and I have always been a snuggly couple. It\u2019s nothing over the top, just forehead kisses, hand holding, and arm hugging mostly. I will admit that now that I\u2019m pregnant (due in late dec), Andrew has been way more snuggly.\n\nIf he\u2019s not fixing something in the house, sitting at his computer working, or running an errand, then he\u2019s probably either touching my belly or thinking about doing it lol. He\u2019s excited about being a dad and I think it\u2019s really sweet so I don\u2019t mind.\n\nJenna has been passive aggressive about it since he started doing it. She\u2019ll roll her eyes in annoyance or make a bit of a dramatic show of leaving the room. It\u2019s honestly been annoying but Andrew and I have mostly just ignored it.\n\nLast night when I was curled up on the couch not feeling well, Andrew brought me a drink, kissed my forehead, and then touched my belly while jokingly scolding our baby for making me sick. Jenna kind of huffed, but she waited until Andrew went back to putting some furniture together in the other room before she told me that I needed to stop being such an insensitive jerk by \u201cflaunting\u201d my happy marriage in her face.\n\nI told her I was sorry that she\u2019s going through a tough time in her own marriage, but I\u2019m flaunting anything and it\u2019s not like Andrew and I were doing it to antagonize her. She said we were being inconsiderate and that as long as she\u2019s staying at the house we need to keep our affections confined to our bedroom.\n\nFinally I said that it was *our* home, so I wouldn\u2019t be asking my husband to only act affectionate towards me behind closed doors, and that if it really was that difficult for her to see us together then maybe she'd be better off staying somewhere else.\n\nWell that upset her because she packed some of her stuff up and left shortly afterwards. Today I\u2019ve been getting all kinds of messages from our mom saying how cruel it was of me to toss Jenna out, and I got a message from Jenna saying she still can\u2019t believe how insensitive I\u2019m being about this.\n\nAndrew has assured me that I wasn\u2019t being cruel or insensitive about any of it, but I still feel unsure so I wanted to get some opinions from people who are removed from the situation.\n\nETA:\n\nI just wanted to answer a few questions I keep seeing.\n\nJenna was staying with my husband and I instead of our mom because we have more space at our house than our mom does in hers. It's also a shorter commute to Jenna's job from here, so it was for convenience but I do want to make a point of saying that I love my sister and I wanted to be there for her while she was going through her separation.\n\nShe was also made aware that I was pregnant almost a month before she started staying with us. I found out really early on and she was the second person I told.\n\nI'm also not a huge fan of excessive displays of affection in front of others, and so I didn't really think that Andrew and I had crossed a line or been \"overly\" affectionate in her presence.", "created_utc": 1692916061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160genc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_should_stay_with/", "score": 830, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If anything, she should be glad that you\u2019re not going through what she is. Sounds like Jenna should stay with someone else and/or start seeing a counselor.", "I am glad she left. This is a very precious time to have with your husband and baby to be and it need not be spoiled with negativity.", "NTA. Probably took a while to become an issue because you\u2019re all spending much more time together than you normally do. Telling you to restrict your affection to the bedroom is unreasonable. If anything, if she\u2019s bothered she can stay in her bedroom. If it were me and I was having a hard time, that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. Or go out more. But I\u2019d also be aware that it was a me problem, not a you, who are letting me stay with you in my time of need, problem. Something tells me you have an apology coming when she gets her head together, she just needs some grace right now. In the meantime, you\u2019re in love and having a baby! Congratulations and enjoy this time.", "NTA remotely\n\nIf you didn't already, I'd be letting your mum know that you did not toss her out, that she had actually chose to move out, because that's exactly what happened.\n\nDon't let her try to spin that you are the bad guy who threw her onto the streets at a tough time when you actually were good enough to help her out.", "NTA\n\nYou should be able to be at your most blissful right now, I\u2019m sorry she shit all over that. \n\nShe has no business being in your lives right now to dump on this happy time.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA, but was on the fence with E S H too. Your sister is clearly jealous because of her own failed marriage and is taking it out on you, but you and your husband (or any couple for that matter) should always tone down PDA when there are other people around. I have a single friend and whenever she visits my house for the weekend my husband and I tone down the PDA. I don\u2019t do this because she asked, I do it because I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m rubbing my relationship in her face; I would be especially careful if she had just gotten out of one. That being said, she is staying with you long term, so I think you guys need to find a middle ground where everyone is a little more comfortable. I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep from cuddling in my own living room with my husband for a month, so you guys just gotta find a way to coexist together. I do think her request for no PDA at all is ridiculous, but she\u2019s your sister and I know you aren\u2019t actively trying to hurt her feelings, but she is hurting right now too. I think you two will be able to work things out with a level headed conversation.", "NTA. I actually might have trended towards a \"light NTA\" because of the fact that Jenna's mental state clearly is a bit shaky right now, but she then went and wildly misrepresented the situation to your mother even after having some time to cool down, so forget it. No need to be nice to her, she's the AH and you're 100% in the clear.\n\nHopefully once Jenna has some breathing room she'll realize how she acted and apologize.", "NTA. Ofcourse your sister is going through a tough time.  It's natural that there would be some level of contention seeing where your relationship with your husband is at compared to hers.  Yet in this instance you're sister needs to be an adult and get over herself.  You and your husband are going out of your way to be there and support her.  Anybody with any common decency would know that if somebody opens their door for you, especially in a time of need, you do your best to not interrupt their everyday lives.  She's actually being the insensitive one of you ask me.  The fact that she's disregarding the beautiful and special time you and your husband are in is beyond insensitive.  She's letting her situation get to her and not thinking clearly. Sister needs to get a grip on the reigns of reality or indeed leave you guys for good.", "NTA\nYour sister is jealous because she doesn't have what you have. I think it's just hard for her to deal with seeing you too being so happy and your family growing and hers just crumbled. Not only that she might think she'll never have a chance to have what you have. Yes it's not true but she might feel like her chance to have a family is closing because she's 30. Unless she has kids and you didn't mention it. If she does it's just the affection that she doesn't have.\n\nThat's is an explanation but you don't need to change what you are doing Infront of her because your not doing anything excessive neither is your husband. Maybe sit down with your sister and have a heart to heart with her. Has she spoken to you how shes been through this separation? Or has she just been quite. Also you didn't kick her out she left. You told her if she's not comfortable with how you too act she can find somewhere else to live. And she chose to do that. I would tell your mother that.", "your sister\u2019s envy & AH behavior is not OK! Good riddance!", "Your sister is losing her mind. It doesn't matter what you do. She will never ack owledge her own jealousy is the problem. And your mother and sister would rather cause you to be u happy than to be happy for you. So, don't let what they say affect you and be on the lookout for them sabatoging your happiness. Unhappy family will sometimes bring their whole family down rather than be lifted up. Sad but true.", "NTA,  You\u2019re not in the wrong just because she\u2019s bitter about seeing someone in a happier marriage.", "NTA\n\nShe's being bitter and jealous. It's that simple", "NTA. Tell her to grow up or get out. She is separating from her spouse and having jealousy issues that she needs to get over. She should not be bringing her problems into your home affecting your family. If you think there are problems now it will be magnified if she is still around when the baby arrives.\n\nShort term guest that are invited to your home should get special treatment and allowances from the host. \n\nLong term guest that request to be in your home for their needs should make special allowances and acceptance of your lifestyle.\n\nP.S. Smart move on the starter home instead of expensive wedding and honeymoon. Weddings are a single expensive event that most people forget about anyway. True love doesn't need to impress others.", "She's the asshole. Her failed marriage isn't your problem. Tell her to go get laid or something.", "Oh FFS, no, you are NTA and sister is just being over-sensitive. You didn't even kick her out! All you said was that it's her choice. Tell your family to fuck off, 'cause it's none of their business.", "NTA\n\nHer marital troubles are no excuse to dictate to you in your own home how you interact with your husband.  She may be grieving or bitter and not like to see another\u2019s happiness but that\u2019s her problem and not yours. \n\nLet your mom take her in.", "NTA. Jenna is behaving like sour grapes. If she can't have x then neither should you. Smh. Your house, your home, your hubby, your pregancy...your happiness. Misery loves company. Let those being activists on her behalf take her in.", "NTA I understand her feelings and there's a lot of room for grace here but also... It's your home and marriage. She's a guest living rent free.", "[removed]", "While I can empathize with your. sister, it's your home to behave as you choose", "Your house, your rules, and really, if she doesn't want to see it, she can keep herself behind closed doors. Anyhow, you aren't even slightly overly PDA so NTA", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nBye Felicia.", "NTA. She's jealous and insecure cos she doesn't have a sweet and loving husband like you have Andrew \n\n> Andrew and I have always been a snuggly couple. It\u2019s nothing over the top, just forehead kisses, hand holding, and arm hugging mostly. I will admit that now that I\u2019m pregnant (due in late dec), Andrew has been way more snuggly.\n\nYou guys are adorable \n\nDamn, I hope when I find The One, he'll be as sweet and as loving as your husband", "NTA. My wife and I are both Stage V Clingers, and my divorce-in-process SIL was with us from March to early this month when she found a place. And her attitude was basically \u201cawww y\u2019all are so cute together\u201d etc. because as an adult she recognizes that her problems are not justification to be upset with us for living our lives.", "NTA, but I've been in your sisters shoes and yeah..it sucks to be around lovey dovey couples. However, she's making the choice to be in the same room as you guys. If it bothered me, I'd stay in my room more.", "NTA.\nYou didn\u2019t even toss her out. \nYou just made a suggestion and she chose to leave herself.", "NTA. Your marriage shouldn't have to grind to a halt just because her's did. When guests are over for a short temporary stay (like a dinner, not overnight), sure, it's a good idea to prioritize your guest's comfort. But when guests are living with you...the protocol changes because life has to resume. \n\nYou're just living life in your own home. You've done nothing wrong. You didn't even kick her out. She prioritized her jealousy over working things out with you. She's an adult and it sounds like she needs some alone time anyway.", "NTA!!! You didn't kick her out!!! She is being selfish, it's your home and you're not flaunting you're living your happy life!!!!", "NTA sounds like she's projecting a bit and maybe needs a different space to process her major life changes going on.", "NTA...let her be miserable someplace else. It's easy to see why she is getting a divorce. Main character much? I mean, the audacity. Tell your mom she CHOSE to leave over forehead kisses. Tell her to fuck off. Her stress wasn't good for the baby. Now you bake a happy, fat baby and get in LOTS of snuzzles and kisses. Because sleep deprivation and dirty diapers and toddler tantrums are a comin' up that hill.", "Wow\u2026getting pissed you are getting affection from your husband while pregnant.  You\u2019re a total monster.  /s", "NTA. This kind of affection is really chill and NORMAL especially for a husband and wife expecting. She is really entitled to expect that her presence and her life events should have an affect on yours. Enjoy your sweet little moments together. They\u2019re worth it.", "It sucks for her, but she's staying with you. It doesn't sound like you guys are being over the top. It's probably painful for her to see because of what she's going through. None of that is your fault.", "NTA.", "Tell your mom what you told us. You didn't kick her out. She left. Also, it's probably better if she stays gone because bringing  stress while pregnant or just after pregnancy is unhealthy for you and the baby", "Nta, she is being totally insensitive on several fronts\n1 you are helping HER out\n2.Its your house!\n3.It is or should be a time of joy and love for you and your partner.\nShe should find somewhere else to stay.", "NTA, unless y\u2019all are making out or being sexual in front of her.", "NTA you\u2019re the farthest thing from and ah. Honestly I think your sister is too toxic to live in your home now.  She was fine in the beginning but now her animosity is unfair and unreasonable.  You don\u2019t need that energy as you progress in your pregnancy.  You should be able to enjoy this time quiet with your husband before the baby arrives.  Tell mom she moved herself out and it\u2019s for the best.  She can stay with mom from now on.", "NAH\n\nShe's hurting and had made a connection in her head that living with an expectant couple while newly separated and having a difficult time in general might not be the best way for her to heal up. \n\nIt's her thing. You're expecting a baby! Whatever losses she's trying to recover (from) internally, this is a special time in your and your husband's life and you can't defer your joy and wonder. \n\nYou seem to have a good attitude. Hopefully you have grace when she realizes she was letting her feelings lead her to cause trouble for her hosts. And congratulations, best wishes.", "Don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you how to be happy.\n\nNTA and congrats!", "Your house your rules if she doesn't like it she can move out. Your family has no say in it.", "Lmao that\u2019s hilarious. \u201cHey while I\u2019m staying in the home you pay for AND expecting a kid in just a couple of months, can you please act like a stranger is living with you?\u201d  No.  You are not an asshole. Your guest is an Asshole and is very entitled.  She is the one who needs to be considerate.
