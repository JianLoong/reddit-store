We decided to forego spending money on a wedding or a honeymoon and instead got a cute (but very old lol) house.\n\nMy sister Jenna (30f) and her husband separated a few months back, and she\u2019s been staying with us until she can get back on her feet.\n\nThings were mostly fine in the beginning, I\u2019ve never had issues with my sister before, and she\u2019s always liked Andrew so I never thought there would be any problems.\nAndrew and I have always been a snuggly couple. It\u2019s nothing over the top, just forehead kisses, hand holding, and arm hugging mostly. I will admit that now that I\u2019m pregnant (due in late dec), Andrew has been way more snuggly.\n\nIf he\u2019s not fixing something in the house, sitting at his computer working, or running an errand, then he\u2019s probably either touching my belly or thinking about doing it lol. He\u2019s excited about being a dad and I think it\u2019s really sweet so I don\u2019t mind.\n\nJenna has been passive aggressive about it since he started doing it. She\u2019ll roll her eyes in annoyance or make a bit of a dramatic show of leaving the room. It\u2019s honestly been annoying but Andrew and I have mostly just ignored it.\n\nLast night when I was curled up on the couch not feeling well, Andrew brought me a drink, kissed my forehead, and then touched my belly while jokingly scolding our baby for making me sick. Jenna kind of huffed, but she waited until Andrew went back to putting some furniture together in the other room before she told me that I needed to stop being such an insensitive jerk by \u201cflaunting\u201d my happy marriage in her face.\n\nI told her I was sorry that she\u2019s going through a tough time in her own marriage, but I\u2019m flaunting anything and it\u2019s not like Andrew and I were doing it to antagonize her. She said we were being inconsiderate and that as long as she\u2019s staying at the house we need to keep our affections confined to our bedroom.\n\nFinally I said that it was *our* home, so I wouldn\u2019t be asking my husband to only act affectionate towards me behind closed doors, and that if it really was that difficult for her to see us together then maybe she'd be better off staying somewhere else.\n\nWell that upset her because she packed some of her stuff up and left shortly afterwards. Today I\u2019ve been getting all kinds of messages from our mom saying how cruel it was of me to toss Jenna out, and I got a message from Jenna saying she still can\u2019t believe how insensitive I\u2019m being about this.\n\nAndrew has assured me that I wasn\u2019t being cruel or insensitive about any of it, but I still feel unsure so I wanted to get some opinions from people who are removed from the situation.", "created_utc": 1692916061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160genc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_should_stay_with/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure it is annoying and hurts her, but that is her issue to deal with. You are offering her a roof over her head and she is being ungrateful. She needs therapy. \n\nAlso, you didn't kick her out. You suggested that she may be happier elsewhere if she cannot handle people being nice to each other in their relationship. She likely is spinning it so it seems like you kicked her out.

She should be happy her sister is happy and loved as much as you and your baby are. \nHer divorce is unfortunate.

You gave her options and SHE chose one.  Make sure your famiy is fully versed.  I would send out a text to the family stating that you had given her a choice and SHE is the one that CHOSE to leave.

Cheers to you and your husband!", "NTA - way to stand up for your relationship and set boundaries!", "NTA - not sure how the separation happened but sister of course should be expected to be sensitive to the love life of other couples, family or otherwise.  There's nothing remarkably unexpected about having negative feelings towards others doing things she might have done and enjoyed in the past, it's to be expected.  However, knowing this is to be expected, she should have stayed with mother from the start because it's obvious she's got those issues.  They need to be dealt with in her time, but by her, and not everyone in the family.  Making bad decisions seems to be something sister might have in common with multiple relationships in her life, unfortunately.", "NTA  \n\n\nAs being recently separated I get the pain your sister is feeling.  I feel that too.  My best friend just got married last month and I was one of his groomsmen.
