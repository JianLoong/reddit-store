Her will is more than fair.\n\nAs for your dad, I'd ask him which child does he think will help take care of him when he's old or even injured and needs help.

Good job \u2763\ufe0f", "Not to mention things like health care costs or even a nursing home for years at the end of his life!", "Very true. I still think it\u2019s worth crunching numbers to come up with interest over the years on the defaulted loan. OP didn\u2019t mention how long ago it was but most credit cards are like 20% so start there and see if there\u2019s even be any of Mom\u2019s half left for brother.", "Not everyone lives in the United States! Some counties (like Canada) have no gift tax. As well, even in the US, if she renounced/disclaimed half of the estate, it would go to her brother without tax consequences to her.", "And not in chronological order, by the way.", "I know only what you write and you wrote that you anticipate their death and that..

Guess what? We will all die one day \ud83d\ude0f", "Oh my God you\u2019re so right maybe I will die in my corner", "I feel like you maybe have a guilty conscience that you may cut out of the will or that you have done somebody very wrong. That\u2019s the only way you would be sticking up for this situation. I said it before and I\u2019ll say it again fuck off.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks for the laugh, I truly enjoyed the banter \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Don't pass your guilty conscience on me \ud83e\udd37"]}
