So probably not the right sub reddit for this question. It's likely each country has different rules around this, so I can't guarantee what I'm about to say is the same in your situation, I would advise speaking to someone that understands property law in your country, maybe the solicitor your working with. In the UK, it all depends what the ownership/mortgage is written as. If you buy a property as joint tenants, you are entitled to 50% of the value of the property. That is irrelevant of if you actually still live there, or pay mortgage. If someone moves out they can force the person currently living there to sell to get what they are owed. It's only complicated by children. As I said speak to someone who understands property law in your country, and any agreement make sure you get any agreement written into your contracts. Stops any complications happen should you break up.", "If you don\u2019t buy her out after separating you still live in half her house. Which you would need to pay her rent on.

Going through a divorce now in the US with a house involved. It can go one of 6 ways.\n\n1) I get the house in its entirety. If I sell it, I keep all proceeds.\n2) I have to buy them out... same as above. I keep all proceeds from sale.\n3) She gets the house in its entirety. She can keep all proceeds.\n4) She buys me out and.... she keeps all proceeds.\n5) We sell together and split the proceeds 50/50.\n6) Neither sells and it gets foreclosed on and... we get what ever is left over from the auction minus liens and whatnot.\n\nYou'd already be separating at that point and no telling if it'll be an equitable one. Keep them simple and just do 50/50.\n\nNTA for not wanting to, but depending on the laws in your country, you may be required to.", "Seems logically fair to me but I'm not sure it's legally viable.

Call me old fashioned, but if you already know you\u2019re going to break up\u2026 WHY ARE YOU BUYING A HOUSE TOGETHER????????????? Buy your damn house, in your name, other pays rent until the apparently inevitable separation. Good grief. Now I\u2019m having a panic attack"]}
