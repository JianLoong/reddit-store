I work 80-90 hours a week as it is, I do 6 day weeks and work 12 to 16 hours a days, leaving the house at 5am and sometimes not retuning until 9pm/10pm. Sometimes I'll get called in on my day off, and I've tried every excuse in the book to not come in but I still get roped into working, even after ive been drinking. I'm the manager, and we've had trouble finding staff lately, so it becomes my job to do everyone else's. \n\nI worked every single day in the month of November, and when I was rostered for Saturday just gone off, I decided I was leaving at 6pm on Friday and taking my Saturday to go wild and live again. This, for me, meant copious amounts of drugs and drink. I decided I was going to do as much as was safe, and I absolutely was not going into work on Saturday no matter what. \n\nSo I spent Friday night doing that, and into Saturday morning. Come 9am Saturday morning, the owner of my workplace started ringing me. As soon as I saw the name pop up on my screen, I took a fat line of MDMA so that I could have the best possible excuse to not come in. \n\nHe asked me would I come in, and I told him I was in no fit state to come in to work and that he'd have to find someone else to cover, I could not possibly face customers in my current state. He told me he didn't care if I had been drinking and that I was needed so I had to come in. \n\nI told him I had been drinking, but I had also been chewing jaw for the better part of 12 hours and had taken a line just before answering the phone. He still tried convincing me to come in and I told him no, he'd have to find someone else. \n\nHe was off yesterday, but when he came in today he told me I had no business disclosing my drug use to him, and I shouldn't use drugs if I'm gonna be called in to work, and basically I should expect he. He thinks I'm an ass for not coming in to begin with, but he thinks I'm a bigger ass for telling him exactly why I couldn't come in.

You could've avoided the whole situation by just letting it go to voicemail. NTA for wanting time off. YTA for making it way more difficult than it had to be.", "You don\u2019t have to give any excuse as to why you can\u2019t come in. I agree that you don\u2019t have any business disclosing your drug use to an employer. The next time he asks you to come in, tell him no, end of story.", "No is a full sentence. Demand me to come in? Are you paying OT once my 40 hours are up? No? Ok bye.", "info: why are you working such insane hours? is it willful?\n\ntypically if you can afford not to come in you just shouldn't. you funny HAVE to answer the phone for anybody in your off days. If the treatment is super bad compounded with this I'd say get a new job", "INFO: If you don't plan on going to work, know your boss doesn't care what excuse you have he and expects you to come in whatever the reason you can't, why even bother answering the phone?", "Lol there's almost no circumstance where \"sorry I'm high on hella drugs rn\" is something you should disclose to your employer/boss/coworkers. Like, ever. You also shouldn't have to explain further than, \"no, I'm not available.\" If you DO feel it's necessary to give a reason, my go-to excuse for not coming in on my day off has always been, \"sorry, I'm visiting with family in (xyz town that's a 3 hr drive from home).\"\n\nYTA, but as at least one other commenter pointed out you're being an AH mostly to yourself", "YTA to yourself on so many different levels.", "Dude, just don\u2019t answer the phone. It\u2019s that simple.", "NTA. But no is a full sentence. I don't understand why you would give him potential ammunition to screw you over", "YTA \nJust say no. \nTo drugs, to excessive alcohol, but most of all to your boss. You're 19, you shouldn't be working 80-90 hrs a week, let alone not have any time off. Drugs shouldn't be the reason to not come in.", "NTA but I definitely wouldn't have given the full reason like you did. They aren't owed an explanation anyway, so I think saying nothing more than \"I cannot come in, find someone else to cover\" would suffice. Or, better yet, not picking up the call in the first place. Even if they bitched about it, that's not your problem. Learning to say no will be useful for future jobs. I remember being your age and finding it SO hard to say no because I was afraid of what other people would think.\n\nThen I had to learn to say no for my own mental health, and it was one of the best changes I could have made. I stopped caring so much what other people thought and I feel like I valued myself more.\n\nNext time, it's also ok to also NOT answer your phone. For all they know, you were away from your phone and was unreachable. Honestly, don't feel like you need to answer EVERY TIME your work calls you on your day off. It's actually easier if you simply don't answer and, if they ask the next time you're in, you can say \"sorry, I wasn't by my phone when you called\" or even the truth, \"sorry, it was my day off, so I wasn't able to come in, even if you needed me.\"", "NTA.  My advice, find another job.  I've been in this situation as a manager where everything fell to me.  I had two stores so I'd have to figure out how to cover two stores at once.  Your boss doesn't respect you, no one should be expected to be on call and work 80+ hours a week regularly.  Or you can set boundaries.  Say no when you're getting called in.  You guys are short staffed and it sounds like he can't afford to lose you right now, but your life is also important and you should have one outside of your job.", "YTA  You need to learn diplomacy for your next job as I'm sure you will be fired from this one soon.  When you are a manager, it's usually the deal that you work if someone else doesn't show.  However if you are being overworked and not paid for the extra work (on a salary) and are in the US you can contact the Board of Labor in your state.  You sure as hell never disclose alcohol and drug use in the workplace.", "You try to be a professional but the truth is you're a teenager that the owner can take advantage of The only a****** is you for not understanding what you can be", "ESH. Your boss sounds like a piece of work, but if whatever you're doing is illegal that is really not something you should be telling him, especially on a work line. Imo, don't even answer the phone if you're called on your day off.", "So instead of just saying no you decided to act like a stereotypical frat boy and disclose that to your employer?", "I don\u2019t think this actually happened but on the off chance it did:-\n1) you\u2019re 19 don\u2019t be a manager and work all those hours it\u2019s like the one time in your life you get to be irresponsible.\n2) you don\u2019t have to give a reason to not come in on your day off just don\u2019t answer the phone and if you did it certainly shouldn\u2019t be I\u2019m on drugs.\n3) I\u2019m going to sound like a real square here but don\u2019t do drugs.", "ESH\n\nIf you\u2019re off the clock, stay off. That means no answering work calls or texts. Unless your company is going to bump you up to being salaried rather than hourly (and even then that doesn\u2019t allow them constant access to you) you need to set boundaries for yourself and enforce them.", "ESH. Doing MDMA to have an excuse not to come in for unscheduled shifts is certainly\u2026 a choice.\n\nYou should NOT be disclosing your drug use to an employer. Ever. Under any circumstances. It can only come back to bite you.\n\nNo is a complete sentence. Not picking up the phone is fine, too.\n\nYou guys are understaffed because there is no real incentive to offer competitive pay or benefits when they have a 19 year old who consistently works insane hours.\n\nStop letting them exploit you and make staffing their responsibility to fill not yours to cover.", "ESH. Drug binges are bad for your health and disclosing them to your employer is dumb. Just don\u2019t answer your phone - sounds like they can\u2019t afford to fire you so what are they going to do about not being able to reach you on your day off? You have caller ID - it\u2019s not rocket science. And look for a new job in the meantime.", "It's time to find another job. Never ever tell someone anything like that!  You are lucky they didn't report you for a drug test. Next time just don't answer the phone. \n\nYTA", "NTA Look I\u2019m probably just being a prude, but I don\u2019t agree on use of mdma or use of both alcohol together. Sounds like a dangerous combination, but what do I know. I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s correct lol\n\nBut when you\u2019re off your off, especially what seems like running yourself into the ground. \n\nYou need to stand up for yourself and tell him agree to less hours and better staff or your looking for other work.\n\nAnd this may be my own regrets, but why aren\u2019t you at or starting college? Not that college is for everyone nor should it be. Some go to college while others jump into work( and there\u2019s nothing wrong with either)but I\u2019d just like to ask if you don\u2019t mind.", "KTA", "Holy crap, YTA.\n\nDoing drugs and drinking all night is both irresponsible and immature when you have work responsibilities to show up on time for your job.\n\nHonestly, I would have fired you.
