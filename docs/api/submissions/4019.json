You also shouldn't have to explain further than, \"no, I'm not available.\" If you DO feel it's necessary to give a reason, my go-to excuse for not coming in on my day off has always been, \"sorry, I'm visiting with family in (xyz town that's a 3 hr drive from home).\"\n\nYTA, but as at least one other commenter pointed out you're being an AH mostly to yourself", "YTA to yourself on so many different levels.", "Dude, just don\u2019t answer the phone.

They aren't owed an explanation anyway, so I think saying nothing more than \"I cannot come in, find someone else to cover\" would suffice. Or, better yet, not picking up the call in the first place. Even if they bitched about it, that's not your problem. Learning to say no will be useful for future jobs. I remember being your age and finding it SO hard to say no because I was afraid of what other people would think.\n\nThen I had to learn to say no for my own mental health, and it was one of the best changes I could have made. I stopped caring so much what other people thought and I feel like I valued myself more.\n\nNext time, it's also ok to also NOT answer your phone. For all they know, you were away from your phone and was unreachable. Honestly, don't feel like you need to answer EVERY TIME your work calls you on your day off. It's actually easier if you simply don't answer and, if they ask the next time you're in, you can say \"sorry, I wasn't by my phone when you called\" or even the truth, \"sorry, it was my day off, so I wasn't able to come in, even if you needed me.\"", "NTA.  My advice, find another job.  I've been in this situation as a manager where everything fell to me.  I had two stores so I'd have to figure out how to cover two stores at once.  Your boss doesn't respect you, no one should be expected to be on call and work 80+ hours a week regularly.  Or you can set boundaries.  Say no when you're getting called in.

Drug binges are bad for your health and disclosing them to your employer is dumb.

The only point of my comment is that their response is perfectly relevant and has everything to do with what you said.\n\nI love it when people edit their comments after I respond lol - the fact that they were gonna do it anyway does mean they didn\u2019t *just* do it as an excuse to get out of work, even if choosing to do it in that particular moment was for the excuse.

What's your excuse?\n\n> the fact that they were gonna do it anyway does mean they didn\u2019t just do it as an excuse to get out of work\n\nI never said otherwise. There is zero contradiction here. \n\n> And quoting the original text doesn\u2019t change anything if OP has given further clarification that changes the details of the original text.\n\nBut their clarification doesn't change the detail of the original text in any meaningful way. That they chose to respond ONLY to that comment is a bit more telling. Why is that their hill to die on and what exactly are the stakes for you? You don't even have a horse in this extremely unimportant race.\n\nOP is deflecting from the rest of my comment by focusing on a throwaway line that has nothing to do with anything else I said. Their reasons for doing MDMA do not matter, but either way it absolutely was a choice, which is all I said. \n\nIt's truly bizarre that you are not only so invested in this but that you also think I'm trying to like, sabotage your comment or something.
