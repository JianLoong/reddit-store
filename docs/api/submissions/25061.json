I've met the couple getting married maybe 10 times total and I get along with them, wouldn't say I'm close to them. \n\nFor context, when my girlfriend and I first started dating, she was a bridesmaid in another wedding, maybe 6 months after we started dating. I went with her and had met the couple getting married twice before, and I knew no one other than my girlfriend there. I'm usually a social guy but it was so awkward/uncomfortable. It was a low budget wedding and I was \"assigned\" to do a lot of work to help set up since I'm a big guy, so I was doing physical labour in the hot sun. Then during the wedding I was coated in sweat since I showed up in my suit and was put to work when I didn't know I would be. Then after the ceremony my girlfriend and the whole wedding party disappeared for about 2 hours to take pictures while I sat around with people I didn't know. Then when they got back, I sat at a table and had dinner with people I didn't know. It was pretty awkward, I ended up leaving shortly after the dinner because I wasn't having a good time. \n\nI told my GF about this and she was a mix of upset/understanding. I told her I felt used since it felt like I was told to do work then tossed aside. I told her I won't go to another wedding like that where I'll feel used and/or will barely know anyone. \n\nNow, coming to the upcoming wedding. Other than my girlfriend, I know the couple getting married (not super well as I said earlier), a couple of the other bridesmaids (also not well), and a few members of my girlfriend's family. My girlfriend has known the bride since she was a kid and her family knows the bride well, so her parents, brother, and a couple cousins have been invited. \n\nI assumed I'd be sitting at a table with them since I know them and I was completely fine with that. I know them very well at this point and I get along with them extremely well. I've now found out today that since I'm a +1, I'm being sat at a table with the other +1s in the wedding party. I've met all these people either 0 or 1 time, those I met were at the engagement party. I wasn't exactly thrilled about this since I'd once again be stuck with a bunch of people I don't know. \n\nThe wedding is in about 2 months and I told my girlfriend that I may not go. I don't think I'm going to have a good time and I don't want to be a distraction for my girlfriend and the couple who will be having a great time. She's upset about this since she really wants me there, and she thinks it's too late to back out. I'm happy to provide a cash gift to cover my meal, but I don't want to go just to sit around with a bunch of strangers like last time. AITA here?\n\nEdit: I didn't say it here but assumed it would be understood, but my GF will be at the head table as a bridesmaid\n\nEdit 2: further context is that my GF told me \"if I don't have a good time she doesn't want to hear about it\". I don't exactly feel great about her saying that given the awful time I had at the previous wedding. We've been to other weddings (as plain guests and one where we were both in the wedding party) and had a great time", "created_utc": 1692491290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vwg2h/aita_for_bailing_on_a_wedding_once_i_found_out_i/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your girlfriend you\u2019d be willing to go if you could sit with her family and maybe there can be some flexibility.", "NTA Two months is plenty of time to change your RSVP to a wedding. You have offered to pay for your meal if it's too late for the venue or caterer to cancel. I understand your girlfriend wants you to attend but no one wants to be a gooseberry. As a compromise you can offer to attend the wedding, the important part of the day, and skip the reception.", "NTA. What is the point of inviting a +1 when you\u2019re not even going to be together? I would have bail on the wedding too and if this is their seating arrangement, they wouldn\u2019t notice and neither would your GF because she won\u2019t be sitting with you.", "Totally disagree with those saying you\u2019re in the wrong. 2 months is plenty of time to decline without causing any extra costs. Also, no way the dinner is only half an hour, like one commenter said. 2 hours minimum when you take into consideration toasts and speeches. Plus the time alone while photos are being taken. It would be hours!! Also, GF also knows you probably won\u2019t have a good time, as she said \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about it if you don\u2019t have a good time\u201d. Absolutely NTA!!!", "Your GF's comment about not wanting to hear about it if you didn't have a good time would have been it for me. If I were you, my response would have been \"So you'll be fine hearing about the good time I had by NOT going to the wedding?\"", "NTA\n\nI would ask your GF if it's possible to be seated with her family, not just thrown away at the randos table. Maybe she could talk to the bride. Maybe it's not and then I think you are fine with not going.", "NTA.\n\nI think it's pretty shitty of her to basically demand you go knowing you're going to be unhappy but you're not allowed to tell her that.\n\nSo it's really all about her and you're supposed to paint a phony smile on your face.\n\nDoesn't sound like a good partner to me.", "Tbh I feel like this is a tough one. On one hand, it\u2019s pretty standard to have a table dedicated to the plus ones of the wedding party (a table that\u2019s typically placed near the head table for that matter). On the other hand, I feel like it\u2019s also a bit lazy of the couple to group tables solely based on that and not by friend groups/families. It\u2019s an uncomfortable situation to be floating around during dinner time without anyone to talk to, but if you went, you\u2019d still be able to mingle with your gf\u2019s family during the ceremony and cocktail hour and then reunite with your gf for the remainder of the reception once the dinner and toasts are over. At that point, seating pretty much goes out the window and guests are welcome to plop wherever to some degree haha", "NTA. There is no reason for you to go since you will be spending zero time with your GF.", "NTA.  As your GF is at the bridal party table it is understandable that you would expect to be seated with her family.  I've been that +1 seated at a table with people I didn't know instead of family or friends I did know.  I won't do it again as the wedding was a horrible experience for me.  It's not too late to change your rsvp, the wedding is 2 months away, but you need to do it now.  You GF is an AH for just coming out and saying she doesn't even want to hear about it if the wedding is not an enjoyable experience for you.", "I was kinda on the \u201cjust suck it up for one day\u201d train but your gf saying she \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to hear about it\u201d when you\u2019re miserable is kinda wack.\n\nNTA you shouldn\u2019t be forced to attend a wedding where really noone seems to care that you\u2019re there", "NTA. It really shouldn't be a big deal to not go. It's not like you're going to send an insulting message to the couple about it or be angry at your girlfriend for going. \n\nIf appropriate, you can ask about being seated with the people you know, but only if the request won't escalate the situation.", "NTA.To me a wedding is a celebration of a couple and their decision to commit their lives meaningfully to one another. You said yourself that you don't have a close relationship with the couple so the likelihood that they'll care is slim, especially if you're offering a cash gift to cover the cost of your meal. This sounds more to me like your girlfriend wants to have her cake and also eat it - she wants you around to be at her disposal for pictures and dancing but doesn't care about what your experience is like when she's hanging with the bridal party and doing required group events like photos and dinner. No foul on your end to sit this one out, not every event has to be a couple's thing.", "NTA, but I'd also need some more info. Do all of the other +1s know each other?

I think it's a frivolous reason, but you're a +1 so you're not obligated to be there anyway.", "YTA. This is one of those suck it up and be happy and be their for your GF type events", "NTA - what you feel is perfectly justified in this situation and not going is absolutely ok. People shouldn\u2019t be cast aside just like and ignored.", "NTA, but it is something to think about as far as compatibility with your girlfriend goes.

It\u2019s also worth asking yourself if you expect her to show up at your work events or family gatherings that she\u2019s not interested in, just to make sure that you\u2019re not being unfair to her.", "Do you have a good relationship with your GF ? \nBecause if yes then go to the wedding . It\u2019s some thing small you can do for her. \nIf you are not sure if this is your person for life then don\u2019t go. Yes it\u2019s going to be boring for you but this is just a way to support your partner. Because if she\u2019s your life mate then these friends are going to be in your life for a long time. \nNo point in creating an unnecessary fracture in the relationship by refusing for seating chart as a reason", "NTA -  they are the AH to not have you sitting you with your GF", "YTA. You\u2019d be going for her, not for yourself. You don\u2019t have to stay seated at your table the entire time. The seating is just for the meal service.

You also don\u2019t have to be the last one to leave.\n\nGo with your girlfriend to support her, get some pics of you two dressed up.

That is weird.", "Head tables are so stupid, for precisely this reason.  NTA, but you should go.", "Ehhh this one is tough.\n\nOne, it is a bit late to be backing out of a wedding outside of a dire emergency. Especially since your issue is a seating arrangement. Doing so will be a blow to your gf and also might strain her relationship with the couple getting married, especially if she has to be honest as to why you\u2019re not going!\n\nThe bride and groom are usually balancing enormous demands and trying to do seating with dozens of other things going on. It\u2019s pretty reasonable to have bridal party +1s often seated elsewhere. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had an issue where you were taken for granted at another wedding, and that in general it\u2019s hard to chat with folks for you. The reception / dinner eating part of the wedding is usually just a short time and then people mill about. \n\nI am gonna go with mild YTA if you back out due to the seating chart. It\u2019s not about you, and furthermore it\u2019s a short part of the wedding (typically food etc).

If you're so social as you say in your post, why is it so hard for you to strike up a conversation with a few people you don't know? You can talk about movies, work, what sort of hobbies you like, etc. This is kind of the point of seating people who don't know each other together at the wedding reception (+1's or not).", "NTA.  I can't imagine being told to go, sit, eat, and act like I'm having fun sittibg with a bunch of strangers for hours while your gf mingle and have fun.", "YTA. Go for your gf. Will it be fun? Probably not. But that's just boyfriend duty. Especially after you've RSVPed its just rude to back out.", "NTA, a plus one table is a joke.", "YTA. How do you meet new people if you don't ever socialize with people you don't already know? As a socially awkward introvert myself, I know it's difficult, but look at it as low-stakes practice in being charming and making friendly connections with people. You may never have to see these people again, so if you happen to make a mishap, it won't matter. Better yet, view it as practice in actively listening to people- ask them about themselves and as best you can, genuinely listen to them without focusing on what you're going to say next. People like that, and you'll get the reputation of being a thoroughly pleasant and thoughtful individual to talk to.\n\nDo it for your girlfriend, yes, but do it for yourself, too. You never know who you might meet, or how important the connections you make might be to you  someday.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t go. That sounds horrifying.", "Gentle YTA. I get that it wouldn't be the most fun for you ever, but you're not going for yourself, you're going for her. I assume she'd do the same for you. At least this time, her family will be there and it seems that you are more familiar with them. I don't reckon you'd have to be seated at your assigned table the entire time -- you could go visit her family, visit with your girlfriend, have some dances together. All together it will be a positive for you in her and her family's eyes. Not going may be understandable, but I don't imagine it'll look great. I guess it depends on how you see things going with her, how much her and her family think well of you matters to you.", "YTA.
