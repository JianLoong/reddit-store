I've met the couple getting married maybe 10 times total and I get along with them, wouldn't say I'm close to them. \n\nFor context, when my girlfriend and I first started dating, she was a bridesmaid in another wedding, maybe 6 months after we started dating. I went with her and had met the couple getting married twice before, and I knew no one other than my girlfriend there. I'm usually a social guy but it was so awkward/uncomfortable. It was a low budget wedding and I was \"assigned\" to do a lot of work to help set up since I'm a big guy, so I was doing physical labour in the hot sun. Then during the wedding I was coated in sweat since I showed up in my suit and was put to work when I didn't know I would be. Then after the ceremony my girlfriend and the whole wedding party disappeared for about 2 hours to take pictures while I sat around with people I didn't know. Then when they got back, I sat at a table and had dinner with people I didn't know. It was pretty awkward, I ended up leaving shortly after the dinner because I wasn't having a good time. \n\nI told my GF about this and she was a mix of upset/understanding. I told her I felt used since it felt like I was told to do work then tossed aside. I told her I won't go to another wedding like that where I'll feel used and/or will barely know anyone. \n\nNow, coming to the upcoming wedding. Other than my girlfriend, I know the couple getting married (not super well as I said earlier), a couple of the other bridesmaids (also not well), and a few members of my girlfriend's family. My girlfriend has known the bride since she was a kid and her family knows the bride well, so her parents, brother, and a couple cousins have been invited. \n\nI assumed I'd be sitting at a table with them since I know them and I was completely fine with that. I know them very well at this point and I get along with them extremely well. I've now found out today that since I'm a +1, I'm being sat at a table with the other +1s in the wedding party. I've met all these people either 0 or 1 time, those I met were at the engagement party. I wasn't exactly thrilled about this since I'd once again be stuck with a bunch of people I don't know. \n\nThe wedding is in about 2 months and I told my girlfriend that I may not go. I don't think I'm going to have a good time and I don't want to be a distraction for my girlfriend and the couple who will be having a great time. She's upset about this since she really wants me there, and she thinks it's too late to back out. I'm happy to provide a cash gift to cover my meal, but I don't want to go just to sit around with a bunch of strangers like last time. AITA here?\n\nEdit: I didn't say it here but assumed it would be understood, but my GF will be at the head table as a bridesmaid\n\nEdit 2: further context is that my GF told me \"if I don't have a good time she doesn't want to hear about it\". I don't exactly feel great about her saying that given the awful time I had at the previous wedding. We've been to other weddings (as plain guests and one where we were both in the wedding party) and had a great time", "created_utc": 1692491290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vwg2h/aita_for_bailing_on_a_wedding_once_i_found_out_i/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have offered to pay for your meal if it's too late for the venue or caterer to cancel. I understand your girlfriend wants you to attend but no one wants to be a gooseberry. As a compromise you can offer to attend the wedding, the important part of the day, and skip the reception.", "NTA. What is the point of inviting a +1 when you\u2019re not even going to be together? I would have bail on the wedding too and if this is their seating arrangement, they wouldn\u2019t notice and neither would your GF because she won\u2019t be sitting with you.", "Totally disagree with those saying you\u2019re in the wrong. 2 months is plenty of time to decline without causing any extra costs. Also, no way the dinner is only half an hour, like one commenter said. 2 hours minimum when you take into consideration toasts and speeches. Plus the time alone while photos are being taken. It would be hours!! Also, GF also knows you probably won\u2019t have a good time, as she said \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about it if you don\u2019t have a good time\u201d. Absolutely NTA!!!", "Your GF's comment about not wanting to hear about it if you didn't have a good time would have been it for me.

Maybe it's not and then I think you are fine with not going.", "NTA.\n\nI think it's pretty shitty of her to basically demand you go knowing you're going to be unhappy but you're not allowed to tell her that.\n\nSo it's really all about her and you're supposed to paint a phony smile on your face.\n\nDoesn't sound like a good partner to me.", "Tbh I feel like this is a tough one. On one hand, it\u2019s pretty standard to have a table dedicated to the plus ones of the wedding party (a table that\u2019s typically placed near the head table for that matter). On the other hand, I feel like it\u2019s also a bit lazy of the couple to group tables solely based on that and not by friend groups/families. It\u2019s an uncomfortable situation to be floating around during dinner time without anyone to talk to, but if you went, you\u2019d still be able to mingle with your gf\u2019s family during the ceremony and cocktail hour and then reunite with your gf for the remainder of the reception once the dinner and toasts are over. At that point, seating pretty much goes out the window and guests are welcome to plop wherever to some degree haha", "NTA. There is no reason for you to go since you will be spending zero time with your GF.", "NTA.  As your GF is at the bridal party table it is understandable that you would expect to be seated with her family.  I've been that +1 seated at a table with people I didn't know instead of family or friends I did know.  I won't do it again as the wedding was a horrible experience for me.  It's not too late to change your rsvp, the wedding is 2 months away, but you need to do it now.  You GF is an AH for just coming out and saying she doesn't even want to hear about it if the wedding is not an enjoyable experience for you.", "I was kinda on the \u201cjust suck it up for one day\u201d train but your gf saying she \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to hear about it\u201d when you\u2019re miserable is kinda wack.\n\nNTA you shouldn\u2019t be forced to attend a wedding where really noone seems to care that you\u2019re there", "NTA. It really shouldn't be a big deal to not go. It's not like you're going to send an insulting message to the couple about it or be angry at your girlfriend for going. \n\nIf appropriate, you can ask about being seated with the people you know, but only if the request won't escalate the situation.", "NTA.To me a wedding is a celebration of a couple and their decision to commit their lives meaningfully to one another. You said yourself that you don't have a close relationship with the couple so the likelihood that they'll care is slim, especially if you're offering a cash gift to cover the cost of your meal. This sounds more to me like your girlfriend wants to have her cake and also eat it - she wants you around to be at her disposal for pictures and dancing but doesn't care about what your experience is like when she's hanging with the bridal party and doing required group events like photos and dinner. No foul on your end to sit this one out, not every event has to be a couple's thing.", "NTA, but I'd also need some more info. Do all of the other +1s know each other?

This is one of those suck it up and be happy and be their for your GF type events", "NTA - what you feel is perfectly justified in this situation and not going is absolutely ok. People shouldn\u2019t be cast aside just like and ignored.", "NTA, but it is something to think about as far as compatibility with your girlfriend goes.

It\u2019s also worth asking yourself if you expect her to show up at your work events or family gatherings that she\u2019s not interested in, just to make sure that you\u2019re not being unfair to her.", "Do you have a good relationship with your GF ? \nBecause if yes then go to the wedding . It\u2019s some thing small you can do for her. \nIf you are not sure if this is your person for life then don\u2019t go.

That is weird.", "Head tables are so stupid, for precisely this reason.  NTA, but you should go.", "Ehhh this one is tough.\n\nOne, it is a bit late to be backing out of a wedding outside of a dire emergency. Especially since your issue is a seating arrangement. Doing so will be a blow to your gf and also might strain her relationship with the couple getting married, especially if she has to be honest as to why you\u2019re not going!\n\nThe bride and groom are usually balancing enormous demands and trying to do seating with dozens of other things going on. It\u2019s pretty reasonable to have bridal party +1s often seated elsewhere. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had an issue where you were taken for granted at another wedding, and that in general it\u2019s hard to chat with folks for you. The reception / dinner eating part of the wedding is usually just a short time and then people mill about. \n\nI am gonna go with mild YTA if you back out due to the seating chart. It\u2019s not about you, and furthermore it\u2019s a short part of the wedding (typically food etc).

If you're so social as you say in your post, why is it so hard for you to strike up a conversation with a few people you don't know? You can talk about movies, work, what sort of hobbies you like, etc. This is kind of the point of seating people who don't know each other together at the wedding reception (+1's or not).", "NTA.  I can't imagine being told to go, sit, eat, and act like I'm having fun sittibg with a bunch of strangers for hours while your gf mingle and have fun.", "YTA. Go for your gf. Will it be fun? Probably not. But that's just boyfriend duty. Especially after you've RSVPed its just rude to back out.", "NTA, a plus one table is a joke.", "YTA. How do you meet new people if you don't ever socialize with people you don't already know? As a socially awkward introvert myself, I know it's difficult, but look at it as low-stakes practice in being charming and making friendly connections with people. You may never have to see these people again, so if you happen to make a mishap, it won't matter. Better yet, view it as practice in actively listening to people- ask them about themselves and as best you can, genuinely listen to them without focusing on what you're going to say next. People like that, and you'll get the reputation of being a thoroughly pleasant and thoughtful individual to talk to.\n\nDo it for your girlfriend, yes, but do it for yourself, too. You never know who you might meet, or how important the connections you make might be to you  someday.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t go. That sounds horrifying.", "Gentle YTA. I get that it wouldn't be the most fun for you ever, but you're not going for yourself, you're going for her. I assume she'd do the same for you. At least this time, her family will be there and it seems that you are more familiar with them. I don't reckon you'd have to be seated at your assigned table the entire time -- you could go visit her family, visit with your girlfriend, have some dances together. All together it will be a positive for you in her and her family's eyes. Not going may be understandable, but I don't imagine it'll look great. I guess it depends on how you see things going with her, how much her and her family think well of you matters to you.", "YTA.

Your girlfriend is likely to be busy the entire time anyway, and not everyone is happy chatting to people they don't know, especially after past bad experiences.

There is nothing worse than having people drop out at the last minute, or being forced to go because now talking about it is stressing your partner out and you can't DO this to them. Tell her that you've decided you aren't going, but that you hope she has a lovely time, and pitch in for the wedding gift she's giving them. If she's worried about being embarassed, make up a story about some other situation that needs your attention (these people don't know you after all) that she can end with \"but he sends all his best wishes\" possibly with \"...and hopes you like our gift\" at the end if the two of you go in on something expensive. \n\nYou are absolutely allowed to set boundaries about what you are or aren't comfortable doing with her. If it's exceedingly important to her that you come (like there's someone there she really wants you to meet, or she really needs the support or something), the two of you can negotiate, but otherwise it's better to just be firm about it. Support her in being a bridesmaid, but don't make yourself uncomfortable doing it unless you have to", "NTA", "NTA. Normally I\u2019d be on the take one for the team train, you never know the people at the plus one table could be a good time, you could spend time at the bar.

As she\u2019s a bridesmaid, she\u2019s probably at the bridal table so this wasn\u2019t done to separate you and maybe the couple didn\u2019t think to place you with gf\u2019s family. Even if you\u2019re with people you don\u2019t know, that\u2019s only really to eat, otherwise people mill about. I had a similar situation last year where my fianc\u00e9e was a groomsman and I knew few people. I sucked it up because he wanted me there and moved around to speak with people I knew outside of when we were eating. I also befriended my table some. It was uncomfortable at times but overall manageable and it was important to someone I love. Your gf is also nasty for telling you she didn\u2019t want to hear it if you had a bad time. It probably sucks for her to hear that and it might upset her, but she can and should have commented that nicely.", "YTA, you RSVP'd to be there, they've paid for your place, and now you're backing out?

There should have been a  mention, so you would have been able to dress accordingly, but your GF was a bridesmaid.\nTo a certain degree it comes with the territory. When you enter into a relationship, it comes with a whole group of relationships and dynamics that you are not part of. Rather than embracing it and going with the flow, you complain.\nShe was a bridesmaid. It is common for +1s to not be seated during the dinner with their partners but rather at the +1 table.\nIt's very normal.\nYou, as a self described social guy, should have taken the opportunity to get to know the people at your table. Ask questions, talk about the wedding, and find out how people met/know each other.\nThat would have been a great time to get to know people you may come in contact with later (like at another wedding). \nThen after supper and speeches comes the part of the night your GF really invited you for.\nThe party.\nDancing, drinks, maybe some silliness.

Instead, you sounded like you got asked to help, and then spent the night pouting, refusing to socialize, and leaving prior to the actual part of the night you would have had her attention.\nWhat did you expect attending a wedding where she was part of the wedding party? Her undivided attention? She left for 2 hours to have photos taken. I can guarantee you that she was crazy busy and all over the place the whole day trying to make it awesome for her friend, and was probably really looking forward to the end of the night, when chaos is over to enjoy it with you.\nInstead you acted like a child and left. No wonder she doesn't want to hear you complain. You probably spent a long time making her feel like crap over a perfectly normal social event because you were bored.\n\nNow you find out she is going to be in another wedding and already decided to back out because you were seated at a table where you dont know anyone. \nYou could have sat with them (her family)  at the ceremony. Chatted with them during cocktail hour. Hung out with her and them after supper.\n\nAll you had to do was put on a happy face, suck it up for a few hours during the supper (maybe 2.5 hours at the most) and then had fun.\n\nSo ya YTA for being angry that you had to share her attention/time and not being allowed to sit for one meal where ever you wanted.", "NTA.

Her parents will be asking why you aren't there.\n\nSo this may not be the hill you want to die on but you could do stuff to make it a little more interesting and comfortable for you.  I wouldn't dress too formally.  Neat, casual rather than suit and tie.  If your girlfriend insists on a suit and tie - wear that to the ceremony but bring a change of clothes for the reception.  Your girlfriend will be busy with photos so you can get changed then.  Bring along some entertainment - watch videos on your phone (bring a powerbank or three and/or pack a charger).  Gives you something to do.\n\nWith the location, can you go outside and wander and just come in for the food.  I take it there is alcohol... free alcohol for you... make good use of it.  If you are the designated driver, I'd be getting lots of alcohol, taking it outside and giving the plants a good time... it will eat up the alcohol budget so even though you won't be imbibing it... you'll still get your money's worth.\n\nI don't think I would be bothering with a present.  Your girlfriend will probably have an outlay for her stuff in the wedding.  If there is a wishing well, put in a card with your written well wishes but leave the back of the envelope open.  It's possible they may think that someone took the money that should've been inside there.. but it was never there in the first place.

If you are really thinking about doing life with this person, sometimes you have to suck shit up because of the person you love who needs your support. I\u2019m sure in the past or even in the future you will have an event/ work do whatever that you will want your partner to come to.It may not be something she into, she might be with strangers, she might be a bored but I imagine you would want her there to support you. Relationships take sacrifice and unless attending this wedding is going to cause you serious harm, surely you can manage a few hours to support your partner. You can even say, hey I\u2019m doing this to support you and people you care about. It shows deeper love, compassion and maturity", "NTA\n\n>She's upset about this since she really wants me there\n\nWhy? She's probably not even going to be with you for the whole wedding. \n\n>\"if I don't have a good time she doesn't want to hear about it\"\n\nGoing would definitely be off the table now even regardless if you get seated elsewhere if that is how you'll be treated by your GF.", "NTA. I\u2019d say just go to the reception after the food has finished. That way you\u2019re not being roped into any helping, you\u2019re not having to sit with strangers for the meal and speeches, and you\u2019re not having to hang about alone during pictures. You turn up for the disco part of the evening when you can actually spend time with your girlfriend. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been the girlfriend of the best man before and had to sit separately as he was on the top table without me. It wasn\u2019t so bad as I was with people I knew (my boyfriends parents) but I wasn\u2019t thrilled about it when I first realised. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be okay if there was no one on my table that I knew. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to feel like this. Your girlfriend won\u2019t even notice if you\u2019re there or not during the day as she will be too busy.", "NTA. The \"doesn't what to hear about it\" comment is kinda a red flag, you are no trying to stop her going, that's sounds really dismissive.", "YTA, have you ever made a seating chart? There is no way to make everybody happy, compromises have to be made. They cannot read your mind and know which guest is happy to meet new people over dinner and which guest is a prince who absolutely needs to eat with people he knows. And it would be incredibly rude and dramatic to make your wants known - so thankfully you aren't doing that.\n\nShe does suck for not validating your feelings about the previous wedding, but you really ought to be able to put up with a dinner table of people you don't know. They are all friends of friends, so you might have more in common than you realise.", "Surprised by some of the comments here. Being separated like this is totally normal. My partner is a ridiculously sociable person and has ended up part of the wedding party for various friends, meanwhile I sort of know people, sort of don't. Sometimes I've been with other friends, sometimes I've been with complete strangers. I was actually on the head table because he was best man literally yesterday but that's the first time it happened and tbh I didn't really feel like I deserved to be there! It was nice and all but I certainly don't expect it.\n\nYou get separated during photos and during one meal. After that it's all drinking and partying together. It's not a big deal, it's how weddings work. It would be rude to expect to be on the head table of someone you've met a handful of times. YTA I guess.", "NTA and GF sounds exhausting...FFS", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"further context is that my GF told me \"if I don't have a good time she doesn't want to hear about it\". \" .. this makes your gf an AH - simply don't go, and offer too let HER chose the excuse if she wants to.", "NTA! I wouldn't want to go to a wedding if I'm gonna be around a bunch of people I didn't/don't know. Do what's best for you OP, regardless if your gf or anyone else thinks you're wrong for not going.", "NTA when I was bridesmaid and seated at the head table, they seated my partner in the table closest to me so we could still interact, but also with people he had met before, it's not an unreasonable request at all! I don't think cancelling 2 months before would cause much hassle", "I see that but at the same time, I do think in a good serious relationship people should accept that for maybe 1-2 days/weddings a year where your SO is in the bridal party (which usually means the married couple means a lot to your SO). you\u2019re not gonna have a great time but for that day its not about you but about being a support act for your SO and just suck it up and not ruin the experience for them by complaining about it. That being said, it should be a two way street of course, both people in the relationship should make such efforts for eachother and the supported SO should acknowledge and appreciate the \u2018sacrifice\u2019. Your SO wasn\u2019t graceful about this which is not OK and also not OK \u2014 but a separate topic \u2014 that the other married couple unexpectedly put you to work without you agreeing to it.", "I also think that your previous negative experience might be amplifying your feelings about this situation. Your subconscious is probably linking the two and therefore your feelings about them.", "While I agree OP is NTA and he 100% shouldn\u2019t go to a wedding he won\u2019t feel comfortable at, I struggled with this part:\n\n>> the wedding is in about 2 months and I told my girlfriend I may not go\n\nI\u2019ve never organized a wedding, but I\u2019d assume by the 2 month mark you need to know how many guests will be attending - meaning if OP doesn\u2019t want to go, he should let them know asap and not just leave it at \u201cmay not go\u201d. \n\nHowever, I think your suggestion of wanting to sit with her family is a really good compromise.", "But, aside from the gfs comment. Why should he have to suck it up? He doesn\u2019t know the couple or any of the fguests. He\u2019s gonna be miserable. Stay home NTA!", "I mean\u2026she\u2019s already been hearing about it. He\u2019s complaining here about it. She\u2019s in the bridal party it\u2019s clearly a good friend of her\u2019s wedding, and just because they aren\u2019t sitting together for dinner doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re separated the whole time. Part of being in a relationship is doing things you don\u2019t necessarily wanna do for your partner.\n\nHowever, he is entitled to back out if he really doesn\u2019t want to go, but he needs to decide soon", "He's staff there to help move heavy things, duh", "What does she get out of knowing that he's off somewhere having a bad time? That makes her happy?", "People talking about \u2018assessing the relationship\u2019 over this are nuts. He shouldn\u2019t have to go if he doesn\u2019t want to but this wedding format is incredibly common. He\u2019s not been \u2018tossed aside\u2019, he\u2019s just been invited to a typical wedding.", "20/20", "Or the adult SO can suck it up and not need to ruin their partner's day while they're off with their friends unlike the partner stuck in a corner with some randoms.", ">Part of being in a relationship is doing things you don\u2019t necessarily wanna do for your partner.\n\nPart of it is also not forcing your partner to do something they do not like. Besides, she already had a heads up the last time this happened and OP said he wouldn't do it again. If she cared and she is such a good friend with the people getting married she could have arranged for OP to sit with her family. But she clearly doesn't care. So why should OP just suck it up.", "How incredibly fragile do you need to be to need support when you have a party with your best friends? How much of an asshole do you have to be for that support to be putting your partner in some corner to have a bad time?", "She doesn\u2019t care if what kind of experience OP has a the wedding, no real reason to go.", "The third option is to just have wedding couple and parents on the top table. Then bridesmaids and groomsmen can sit with their partners and families.", "Lol I had my wedding party and their plus ones all sitting at the head table, it was awesome", "It\u2019s not her wedding, she doesn\u2019t make the seating chart. And the bride isn\u2019t gonna switch everything up for one plus 1 who can\u2019t handle sitting at a table for an hour with people that he might actually end up liking, because they\u2019re all dating people of the same friend group. His GF isn\u2019t forcing him either, she\u2019s allowed to want him to go with her, and he already rsvp\u2019ed yes so she probably is sad he\u2019s bailing. Idk I just don\u2019t think one evening of dressing up and enjoying a free meal and open bar is that torturous", "She doesn\u2019t care if what kind of experience OP has a the wedding, no real reason to go.", " It's not a big deal, it's how weddings work", "In my \"Bustakita\"  way of looking and living life, I view Nonsensical and outdated etiquette rules in the same category as traditions. Peer pressure from dead people.", "Me and my wife had a sweetheart table and just sat the wedding party where we thought they'd be the most comfortable. For example, one of my wife's coworkers was a bridesmaid, so rather than sit with all of her bridesmaids, she sat with my wife's other coworkers. Or we had some members of a friend group that were in the wedding party and some were not. The entire group was still seated at the same table. Basically, wedding party was seated like any other guest.", "She on the other hand is as supportive as a boiled piece of pasta.", "He wouldn't be going with her. She'd be going with her friends and he'd be going alone. She'll just feel good knowing he's having a shit time.", "I\u2019m irish so similar to UK, but in canada my wife was a bridesmaid and she sat separately from me. \n\nI will say it didn\u2019t seem that big a deal to me.", "Why would she ever vindictively want him to have a bad time? Has everyone forgotten that weddings are usually happy and fun? Also, you\u2019re allowed to get up and walk around at dinner, cocktail hour, etc. it\u2019s not a prison. And then they have the rest of the night to be together and dance and have fun", "About half or more end in divorce anyway. Wear a crown of daisies and a sheepskin jacket and take your bondship vows to a tree or a rock. Invite your friends or likeable family members round for a BYOB pissup\n\nThe rest? To hell with it\n\nOr do what me and my two brothers did. Nothing whatsoever. Decades later still families together with kids. But hey! Each to their own"]}
