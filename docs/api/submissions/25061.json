I've met the couple getting married maybe 10 times total and I get along with them, wouldn't say I'm close to them. \n\nFor context, when my girlfriend and I first started dating, she was a bridesmaid in another wedding, maybe 6 months after we started dating. I went with her and had met the couple getting married twice before, and I knew no one other than my girlfriend there. I'm usually a social guy but it was so awkward/uncomfortable. It was a low budget wedding and I was \"assigned\" to do a lot of work to help set up since I'm a big guy, so I was doing physical labour in the hot sun. Then during the wedding I was coated in sweat since I showed up in my suit and was put to work when I didn't know I would be. Then after the ceremony my girlfriend and the whole wedding party disappeared for about 2 hours to take pictures while I sat around with people I didn't know. Then when they got back, I sat at a table and had dinner with people I didn't know. It was pretty awkward, I ended up leaving shortly after the dinner because I wasn't having a good time. \n\nI told my GF about this and she was a mix of upset/understanding. I told her I felt used since it felt like I was told to do work then tossed aside. I told her I won't go to another wedding like that where I'll feel used and/or will barely know anyone. \n\nNow, coming to the upcoming wedding. Other than my girlfriend, I know the couple getting married (not super well as I said earlier), a couple of the other bridesmaids (also not well), and a few members of my girlfriend's family. My girlfriend has known the bride since she was a kid and her family knows the bride well, so her parents, brother, and a couple cousins have been invited. \n\nI assumed I'd be sitting at a table with them since I know them and I was completely fine with that. I know them very well at this point and I get along with them extremely well. I've now found out today that since I'm a +1, I'm being sat at a table with the other +1s in the wedding party. I've met all these people either 0 or 1 time, those I met were at the engagement party. I wasn't exactly thrilled about this since I'd once again be stuck with a bunch of people I don't know. \n\nThe wedding is in about 2 months and I told my girlfriend that I may not go. I don't think I'm going to have a good time and I don't want to be a distraction for my girlfriend and the couple who will be having a great time. She's upset about this since she really wants me there, and she thinks it's too late to back out. I'm happy to provide a cash gift to cover my meal, but I don't want to go just to sit around with a bunch of strangers like last time. AITA here?\n\nEdit: I didn't say it here but assumed it would be understood, but my GF will be at the head table as a bridesmaid\n\nEdit 2: further context is that my GF told me \"if I don't have a good time she doesn't want to hear about it\". I don't exactly feel great about her saying that given the awful time I had at the previous wedding. We've been to other weddings (as plain guests and one where we were both in the wedding party) and had a great time", "created_utc": 1692491290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vwg2h/aita_for_bailing_on_a_wedding_once_i_found_out_i/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have offered to pay for your meal if it's too late for the venue or caterer to cancel. I understand your girlfriend wants you to attend but no one wants to be a gooseberry. As a compromise you can offer to attend the wedding, the important part of the day, and skip the reception.", "NTA. What is the point of inviting a +1 when you\u2019re not even going to be together? I would have bail on the wedding too and if this is their seating arrangement, they wouldn\u2019t notice and neither would your GF because she won\u2019t be sitting with you.", "Totally disagree with those saying you\u2019re in the wrong. 2 months is plenty of time to decline without causing any extra costs. Also, no way the dinner is only half an hour, like one commenter said. 2 hours minimum when you take into consideration toasts and speeches. Plus the time alone while photos are being taken. It would be hours!! Also, GF also knows you probably won\u2019t have a good time, as she said \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about it if you don\u2019t have a good time\u201d. Absolutely NTA!!!", "Your GF's comment about not wanting to hear about it if you didn't have a good time would have been it for me.

Maybe it's not and then I think you are fine with not going.", "NTA.\n\nI think it's pretty shitty of her to basically demand you go knowing you're going to be unhappy but you're not allowed to tell her that.\n\nSo it's really all about her and you're supposed to paint a phony smile on your face.\n\nDoesn't sound like a good partner to me.", "Tbh I feel like this is a tough one. On one hand, it\u2019s pretty standard to have a table dedicated to the plus ones of the wedding party (a table that\u2019s typically placed near the head table for that matter). On the other hand, I feel like it\u2019s also a bit lazy of the couple to group tables solely based on that and not by friend groups/families. It\u2019s an uncomfortable situation to be floating around during dinner time without anyone to talk to, but if you went, you\u2019d still be able to mingle with your gf\u2019s family during the ceremony and cocktail hour and then reunite with your gf for the remainder of the reception once the dinner and toasts are over. At that point, seating pretty much goes out the window and guests are welcome to plop wherever to some degree haha", "NTA. There is no reason for you to go since you will be spending zero time with your GF.", "NTA.  As your GF is at the bridal party table it is understandable that you would expect to be seated with her family.  I've been that +1 seated at a table with people I didn't know instead of family or friends I did know.  I won't do it again as the wedding was a horrible experience for me.  It's not too late to change your rsvp, the wedding is 2 months away, but you need to do it now.

It really shouldn't be a big deal to not go. It's not like you're going to send an insulting message to the couple about it or be angry at your girlfriend for going. \n\nIf appropriate, you can ask about being seated with the people you know, but only if the request won't escalate the situation.", "NTA.To me a wedding is a celebration of a couple and their decision to commit their lives meaningfully to one another. You said yourself that you don't have a close relationship with the couple so the likelihood that they'll care is slim, especially if you're offering a cash gift to cover the cost of your meal. This sounds more to me like your girlfriend wants to have her cake and also eat it - she wants you around to be at her disposal for pictures and dancing but doesn't care about what your experience is like when she's hanging with the bridal party and doing required group events like photos and dinner. No foul on your end to sit this one out, not every event has to be a couple's thing.", "NTA, but I'd also need some more info. Do all of the other +1s know each other?

This is one of those suck it up and be happy and be their for your GF type events", "NTA - what you feel is perfectly justified in this situation and not going is absolutely ok. People shouldn\u2019t be cast aside just like and ignored.", "NTA, but it is something to think about as far as compatibility with your girlfriend goes.

It\u2019s also worth asking yourself if you expect her to show up at your work events or family gatherings that she\u2019s not interested in, just to make sure that you\u2019re not being unfair to her.", "Do you have a good relationship with your GF ? \nBecause if yes then go to the wedding . It\u2019s some thing small you can do for her. \nIf you are not sure if this is your person for life then don\u2019t go.

That is weird.", "Head tables are so stupid, for precisely this reason.  NTA, but you should go.", "Ehhh this one is tough.\n\nOne, it is a bit late to be backing out of a wedding outside of a dire emergency. Especially since your issue is a seating arrangement. Doing so will be a blow to your gf and also might strain her relationship with the couple getting married, especially if she has to be honest as to why you\u2019re not going!\n\nThe bride and groom are usually balancing enormous demands and trying to do seating with dozens of other things going on. It\u2019s pretty reasonable to have bridal party +1s often seated elsewhere. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had an issue where you were taken for granted at another wedding, and that in general it\u2019s hard to chat with folks for you. The reception / dinner eating part of the wedding is usually just a short time and then people mill about. \n\nI am gonna go with mild YTA if you back out due to the seating chart. It\u2019s not about you, and furthermore it\u2019s a short part of the wedding (typically food etc).

If you're so social as you say in your post, why is it so hard for you to strike up a conversation with a few people you don't know? You can talk about movies, work, what sort of hobbies you like, etc. This is kind of the point of seating people who don't know each other together at the wedding reception (+1's or not).", "NTA.  I can't imagine being told to go, sit, eat, and act like I'm having fun sittibg with a bunch of strangers for hours while your gf mingle and have fun.", "YTA. Go for your gf. Will it be fun? Probably not. But that's just boyfriend duty. Especially after you've RSVPed its just rude to back out.", "NTA, a plus one table is a joke.", "YTA. How do you meet new people if you don't ever socialize with people you don't already know? As a socially awkward introvert myself, I know it's difficult, but look at it as low-stakes practice in being charming and making friendly connections with people. You may never have to see these people again, so if you happen to make a mishap, it won't matter. Better yet, view it as practice in actively listening to people- ask them about themselves and as best you can, genuinely listen to them without focusing on what you're going to say next. People like that, and you'll get the reputation of being a thoroughly pleasant and thoughtful individual to talk to.\n\nDo it for your girlfriend, yes, but do it for yourself, too. You never know who you might meet, or how important the connections you make might be to you  someday.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t go. That sounds horrifying.", "Gentle YTA. I get that it wouldn't be the most fun for you ever, but you're not going for yourself, you're going for her. I assume she'd do the same for you. At least this time, her family will be there and it seems that you are more familiar with them. I don't reckon you'd have to be seated at your assigned table the entire time -- you could go visit her family, visit with your girlfriend, have some dances together. All together it will be a positive for you in her and her family's eyes. Not going may be understandable, but I don't imagine it'll look great. I guess it depends on how you see things going with her, how much her and her family think well of you matters to you.", "YTA.

Your girlfriend is likely to be busy the entire time anyway, and not everyone is happy chatting to people they don't know, especially after past bad experiences.

There is nothing worse than having people drop out at the last minute, or being forced to go because now talking about it is stressing your partner out and you can't DO this to them. Tell her that you've decided you aren't going, but that you hope she has a lovely time, and pitch in for the wedding gift she's giving them. If she's worried about being embarassed, make up a story about some other situation that needs your attention (these people don't know you after all) that she can end with \"but he sends all his best wishes\" possibly with \"...and hopes you like our gift\" at the end if the two of you go in on something expensive. \n\nYou are absolutely allowed to set boundaries about what you are or aren't comfortable doing with her. If it's exceedingly important to her that you come (like there's someone there she really wants you to meet, or she really needs the support or something), the two of you can negotiate, but otherwise it's better to just be firm about it. Support her in being a bridesmaid, but don't make yourself uncomfortable doing it unless you have to", "NTA", "NTA. Normally I\u2019d be on the take one for the team train, you never know the people at the plus one table could be a good time, you could spend time at the bar. But the last comment in your post about what your girlfriend said changed my mind. She really doesn\u2019t seem to care other than to not be without a date it looks like. All she had to say was I know it stinks but I\u2019ll come find you once the dancing starts and we\u2019ll have as good a time as we can then. But nope", "YTA because you haven\u2019t even asked for a solution first. You should have asked your gf to ask the couple if you could sit with her family. As she\u2019s a bridesmaid, she\u2019s probably at the bridal table so this wasn\u2019t done to separate you and maybe the couple didn\u2019t think to place you with gf\u2019s family. Even if you\u2019re with people you don\u2019t know, that\u2019s only really to eat, otherwise people mill about. I had a similar situation last year where my fianc\u00e9e was a groomsman and I knew few people. I sucked it up because he wanted me there and moved around to speak with people I knew outside of when we were eating. I also befriended my table some. It was uncomfortable at times but overall manageable and it was important to someone I love. Your gf is also nasty for telling you she didn\u2019t want to hear it if you had a bad time. It probably sucks for her to hear that and it might upset her, but she can and should have commented that nicely.", "YTA, you RSVP'd to be there, they've paid for your place, and now you're backing out? Rude. OFC the bridal party is at the head table, it's not like they're tossing you in with the weird great-aunts, they're putting you with the other bridal party +1's, so friends of friends.\n\nJust go and make some friends or whatever. Be polite for like an hour drinking some champagne then go sit in the corner and read for all that it matters. You seem so selfish.", "YTA\n\nI've been to many weddings where I didn't know the people at my table\n\nYou are being petty", "YTA\n\nYou have every right to decline going to a wedding. \nShe has every right to be upset her partner isn't going.\nThe couple have a right to be upset that you said yes and then declined.\nHer comment about not wanting to hear about it is not okay.\n\nBut\n\nThe entire first part of your post makes me understand her comment.\nIf you were going to be asked to help, you should have known in advance. There should have been a  mention, so you would have been able to dress accordingly, but your GF was a bridesmaid.\nTo a certain degree it comes with the territory. When you enter into a relationship, it comes with a whole group of relationships and dynamics that you are not part of. Rather than embracing it and going with the flow, you complain.\nShe was a bridesmaid. It is common for +1s to not be seated during the dinner with their partners but rather at the +1 table.\nIt's very normal.\nYou, as a self described social guy, should have taken the opportunity to get to know the people at your table. Ask questions, talk about the wedding, and find out how people met/know each other.\nThat would have been a great time to get to know people you may come in contact with later (like at another wedding). \nThen after supper and speeches comes the part of the night your GF really invited you for.\nThe party.\nDancing, drinks, maybe some silliness. A whole lot of fun and celebration once the more official things are done. \nYou were there to have fun with her AFTER the duties. Instead, you sounded like you got asked to help, and then spent the night pouting, refusing to socialize, and leaving prior to the actual part of the night you would have had her attention.\nWhat did you expect attending a wedding where she was part of the wedding party? Her undivided attention? She left for 2 hours to have photos taken. I can guarantee you that she was crazy busy and all over the place the whole day trying to make it awesome for her friend, and was probably really looking forward to the end of the night, when chaos is over to enjoy it with you.\nInstead you acted like a child and left. No wonder she doesn't want to hear you complain. You probably spent a long time making her feel like crap over a perfectly normal social event because you were bored.\n\nNow you find out she is going to be in another wedding and already decided to back out because you were seated at a table where you dont know anyone. \nYou could have sat with them (her family)  at the ceremony. Chatted with them during cocktail hour. Hung out with her and them after supper.\n\nAll you had to do was put on a happy face, suck it up for a few hours during the supper (maybe 2.5 hours at the most) and then had fun.\n\nSo ya YTA for being angry that you had to share her attention/time and not being allowed to sit for one meal where ever you wanted.", "NTA. Maybe assess your relationship, and ask yourself do you really want to tossed aside everytime?", "Just tell her you\u2019re not going. She gets mad at you oh well she\u2019s gonna get mad at you either way what good does it do if you can\u2019t say anything about being upset and you have to sit alone and be miserable.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend isn't being very nice about it.  If this isn't usually like her then she may be stressed about appearances.  If all the other +1's are at the table and you aren't.. then they will be asking why.  If you are not there, then everyone will be asking why.  Her parents will be asking why you aren't there.\n\nSo this may not be the hill you want to die on but you could do stuff to make it a little more interesting and comfortable for you.  I wouldn't dress too formally.  Neat, casual rather than suit and tie.  If your girlfriend insists on a suit and tie - wear that to the ceremony but bring a change of clothes for the reception.  Your girlfriend will be busy with photos so you can get changed then.  Bring along some entertainment - watch videos on your phone (bring a powerbank or three and/or pack a charger).  Gives you something to do.\n\nWith the location, can you go outside and wander and just come in for the food.  I take it there is alcohol... free alcohol for you... make good use of it.  If you are the designated driver, I'd be getting lots of alcohol, taking it outside and giving the plants a good time... it will eat up the alcohol budget so even though you won't be imbibing it... you'll still get your money's worth.\n\nI don't think I would be bothering with a present.  Your girlfriend will probably have an outlay for her stuff in the wedding.  If there is a wishing well, put in a card with your written well wishes but leave the back of the envelope open.  It's possible they may think that someone took the money that should've been inside there.. but it was never there in the first place.  I wouldn't be telling anyone if you do this.", "Since it\u2019s in 2 months, maybe try to get together with some of the other wedding party members and their +1, and get to know them better \ud83d\ude04 I don\u2019t think anyone is the AH, but you have time to make the best of it.", "NTA, but don\u2019t underestimate \u201cwedding friends!\u201d These are the people you meet at events leading up to the wedding (rehearsal dinner, etc) and all you have in common is the wedding. But you can drink and joke and dance with them and then when you see them at some random holiday party the next year, they\u2019ll still be your wedding friends.", "NAH. I understand why you don\u2019t want to go and why your gf wants you there. Truthfully seating people for a wedding is so stressful and really difficult. but some couples really don\u2019t think too much about it. I agonized and made sure everyone knew who they were sitting with and were sitting with their plus ones. Though even when I was in the bridal party I somehow always made my way to the table my partner was at because I didn\u2019t care that much about assigned seating lol. If she\u2019s open to it, you can ask your gf if she can come visit you more or else you just don\u2019t feel comfy going. If I were her, I\u2019d consider asking the couple to put you at the family table. It really might not have dawned on them this is an issue. Some people think it\u2019s fun to put the plus ones together because they can all mingle. Aka extroverts.", "Just don't go. Definitely don't go and then bail out early.\n\nNAH", "NTA stay home, and to be fair your GF is showing she is a bit of a jerk as well", "Totally been in this exact situation! Everything down to helping set up the hall for the reception, decorating tables, hanging lights, the whole deal! My partner was one of the groomsmen, and I was sat at the \"partners table\". Luckily the folks I sat with were chill and we chatted about feeling kind of awkward. But from then on it was decided that when we get married, we'd have partners of the wedding party sit with the wedding party. We all know each other and are friends anyways, so it makes sense!", "NTA.\n\nWhy would it be to late to back out now OP? you are just a +1, at a table of +1's -home of lost toys-? You aren't in the wedding party and unless they again use you as labour mule, you aren't a needed guest for this wedding", "NTA I am an introvert so having to sit with people I don't know is a hard no from me. You're also not going to be spending time with her.", "NTA- would your gf be putting up with this if the roles were reversed? I suspect not..", "NTA.", "You live in a country with godawful wedding traditions.\n\nBut yea, you\u2019re an arse\u2026 Simply because you can\u2019t take a day off for your girlfriend. \n\nGet fed, get drunk, suffer in misery among your fellow +1s. It\u2019ll be over a lot faster than this brooding, and the 14 days of penance to follow. It can only surprise in a positive way.", "NTA - what an asinine seating arrangement. Who doesn't seating people with their dates at a wedding in 2023?", "YTA. I feel like all the people saying otherwise are the teenagers or something. \n\nThe wedding isn\u2019t about you (somewhat a rando to the couple getting married) and your comfort isn\u2019t going to be their primary concern. Expecting to get put with the family even though you\u2019re *not* isn\u2019t really reasonable. Family comes first and there probably wasn\u2019t space for you because they put actual family at that table. \n\nSometimes being in a long-term relationship involves doing things that are uncomfortable or not fun for you to support your partner. \n\nSitting for a few hours making (possibly) awkward small talk with strangers does not qualify as something that\u2019s unreasonable to expect of a partner. \n\nGrow tf up and go to the wedding. Maybe you\u2019ll make some new friends at the +1 table. And tbh, if you can\u2019t deal with (possibly) not having very much fun for one night, I\u2019d be rethinking the relationship if I was your gf.", "NTA.  Two months is plenty of notice.  Let the couple know that you won\u2019t be attending ASAP.\n\nYour gf will be busy much of the wedding anyway.", "Wow-Just realized, in the 10+ weddings wife and I have been in the bridal party, ours was the only one where we didn\u2019t separate bridal party from their dates", "I have to say I went to this amazing Italian wedding a couple of years ago and they separated everybody. We ate at a huge table that had 200+ people at it. I couldn't see any of the people I knew. \n\nI had the best time, and met some extremely interesting people. Was it awkward at first hell yes. But it was fun nonetheless.", "The random back table is a wierd one.\n\nI mean I had a 'Head tablecloth only the wedding party but besides some pictures and toasts everyone was everywhere.  It was buffet style so we all just doing out own thing and eating and moving.\n\n2 reserved family tables at the front for the grandparents,' parents, and siblings/their kids. And than like everyone choose where to sit no forcing the full reserved named seats thing.", "That was my thought when reading that. She doesn\u2019t care if what kind of experience OP has a the wedding, no real reason to go.", "They're tables of 8 and it's my GFs mom and dad, her brother, and 2 cousins all sitting together. I'm not sure who the other 3 at their table are", "How do you know they won\u2019t have time together? It\u2019s not like it will be a copy of a previous event.", "How is this supporting her?  \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about it\u201d isn\u2019t setting this up to be something she wants support on.  Pass.", "Exactly. Everyone else upset about this are like children who can't handle being around strangers. Take the opportunity to meet new people.", "Yeah, this is one of those times when we have to act like functional adults and do something that isn\u2019t only about us.  Sometimes you have to make small talk and converse with strangers for a couple of hours. This happens at weddings, and funerals, and work events, and if you have kids.  It would be different if someone was personally singling you out and kicking you to the outcast table, but it sounds like you will be with other +1s who will be in the same situation. Have some drinks, get through dinner, and then you can start moving around and talk or dance with other people.  I personally do not enjoy these situations, but it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about supporting my partner or friend or child or whatever. You\u2019ll survive.", "If he\u2019s not even going to get to spend time with his GF, why should he bother going?

If you love your GF than suck it up for a few hours. Be the supportive partner.", "I also think that your previous negative experience might be amplifying your feelings about this situation. Your subconscious is probably linking the two and therefore your feelings about them.", "For my wedding (US), our head table was bride, groom, and our parents.

Yes!!!", "In my country it is mostly done like that, the main table is bride and her parents and groom with his parents.

I don\u2019t think she will care that he\u2019s not there, so it\u2019s not actually doing something nice for someone.", "So the plus ones were blocking the wedding party?", "Right?
