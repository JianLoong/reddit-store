Tbh the solution most likely would be to just communicate better, but we're just having quite a bit of trouble recently. Every time I think we've talked it out and things will be better it goes back to the way it was before in a matter of days. \n\nA few days ago I asked my mother for advise when I was dropping off the kids at her place for the day. She's been married now for over 35 years to my dad and has six adult children so I figured she must be doing something right. \n\nShe responded quickly saying that it was all my fault for not putting my husband and his needs first. It came out so quick I figure she must have been waiting for me to ask her opinion. \n\nI was shocked: Not only did she completely pass the blame on me, what she said sounded like it came straight from the 50s. And it didn't get better from there. She continued elaborating on how and why I've been doing everything wrong from the start criticizing my career choice, my hobbies, my clothing choices etc.. \n\nNow what I did next was probably not completely the right call but tbh I don't really regret it either. Instead of responding I just started laughing loudly for like a minute or so. She asked why I was laughing and I called her crazy for putting all the blame on me and playing on such outdated stereotypes. Next thing I know she screams and cusses at me and throws me and the kids out. It's been four days and she hasn't responded to any of my texts or calls and I'm getting worried. (Apparently she's also 'banned' my dad from answering the phone. I do know through my siblings that she's doing ok, but apparently refuses to talk about our fight with them.) \n\nI've though about trying to apologize to her. So far I've mostly asked to talk to her and if she's alright (we usually check in on each other every day) but I'm not sure I can get myself to lie to her to restore our relationship. Insult added to injury my husband is also (somewhat) mad at me since my parents are the only source of free childcare we have and we bring them to their place most Sundays to catch up on housework, bills, etc..

The advice sounded outdated because your mom is from a completely different generation...Of course it is. I'm not sure what you expected", "NTA \n\nFirst the lack of complete communication-if you truly feel that is the issue at hand then I suggest writing letters to each other explaining the situation as you see it and solutions that you have or stating that you don't know what the solution is.  You can either agree to read these letters to each other (without interruption) or you can read them privately then discuss them from there.  This will allow you to get all your thoughts out and in order without getting sidetracked.  Also a suggestion i make to many newlyweds is get a \"comment\" box, I personally refer to this as the bitch box, and set a recurring time to review the box.  The more problems the more frequent the review time.  Basically it's a small box with paper cards you can use dry erase playing cards or slip of paper whatever works for you.  when something (no matter what it is ) bothers you, you write it down and place it in the box so it can be discussed later at the review time.  If you like as children get older there can be a family box to discuss family matters, with a parent or older sibling helping younger siblings write their problems down. \n\nSecond-the mother-if possible you could apologize but not agree.  It could be something like \"Sorry I laughed at your advice that was disrespectful/rude of me, and you taught me better manners than that.\" Now you can leave it at that or if you feel you must address the \"advice\" she gave you, you could continue with \" I understand that you are trying to help but that is not the way my husband and I live our lives, we are partnership where we are both allowed the same level of care and support not just the husband.\"  This would unfortunately only keep her mad at you for pointing out things in her marriage/life that she already has issues with and you are just reminding her or the way her marriage is unbalanced.\n\nI know this is a long post but I have been married for 23 years (raised to special needs children) and hope to spare others the problems that I/we had to work through alone.", "YTA - her advice sucked for you but you didn\u2019t quite approach it graciously, you picked a fight. \n\nIt just sounds like life\u2019s really getting to you and it\u2019s not helping your relationships.", "NTA - it\u2019s not 1950 anymore", "YTA\nIn addition, there is absolutely nothing old fashioned about prioritizing your husband/ marriage.

But I agree with you that both spouses need to have the same mindset to make it work.\n\nMom being married for 35 years with 6 kids clearly knows a thing or two.", "This is true actually. I\u2019d read an article that dived into how modern parenting puts kids at the centre. It has its benefits but misses one aspect - which is we lost that the marriage came first in the past, the marriage led so to speak. The partners were meant to support eachother as a means to guide and support the family together. The parents needs to provide and each others were solid reasons for moving etc. Kids were taught to be resilient to life and respected that strength I guess in the relationship they were exposed to. Of course to us in modern times it appears like the kids are neglected by this approach, in comparison, I\u2019m sure many were. I am not convinced that modern parenting kinda blindly minimising this aspect is always constructive. IMHO\n\nWe have more adults now who truly believe progress means each person for themself or easy in/easy out with the relationship as long as they do everything (be noble) for the child. **Especially knowing being child minded is what\u2019s causing their issues.** Fact is being noble for your child includes showing them how to be noble in your life and relationships. It\u2019s showing them kids can adapt to the family\u2019s needs and when that\u2019s ok, as they are cared for throughout and always loved. There is balance. I\u2019m not speaking for OP, a sick child is a specific situation I wouldn\u2019t assume.\n\nIn general. Sorry to go off on a tangent lol. Progress does not mean blindly erasing history. Those are the ones doomed to repeat it right? \n\nBtw before I get torn into. I\u2019m very much \u2018progressive\u2019, and not conventional in life choices (unashamedly)\u2026I do consider all aspects of stuff when I can. Im pro most things, for women\u2019s equality, ease of exit from relationships, and improving our child care as much as possible in the interest of kids - I do anything for mine too. I just think we need to check which aspects we cancel before archiving our history and progress.\n\nInterestingly, another study found 86% (if memory serves, definitely 80+%) of married women found the relationship harder than childcare and upkeep. It definitely validated my being single for me, and some things I hear and observe but can\u2019t make sense of. I guess those are the women who feel unhappy and stuck with men who don\u2019t change\u2026anyway. As a single mom whose often met with stereotype sympathy and admiration, I\u2019m usually a bit quiet cause I intentionally avoid marriage for these reasons - single mothering has been easier for me because I don\u2019t have to maintain a relationship. It\u2019s odd, they keep assuming it\u2019s not, even when most spend more time complaining about their struggles and awed at my independence and ease in this respect. It\u2019s cognitive dissonance I think (?), the actual weight and cost of a relationships with kids is not as light as people think. Not to undermine single parenting, I have good support and was very fortunate. Parenting is just a different set of norms, emotions are much more bound, and relationships you have to create and maintain that. I don\u2019t have those skills\u2026\n\n[Freakonomics also had good chapter on \u2018perfect parent\u2019 statistical anomalies (vs socially accepted norms/assumptions) that breaks some myths down.](http://christophe.heintz.free.fr/bgt/Freakonomics__A_Rogue_Economist_Explores_the_Hidden_Side_of_Everything__Revised_and_Expanded_.pdf#page7)\n\nThat got way long \ud83e\udee3\ud83d\ude05", "My parents had a long-lasting marriage. because my mother was a rational, highly disciplined woman with tremendous tolerance.  I remember going to Mass as a 1st grader in 59 and listening to the sermon the priest gave about racist behavior.  I asked mom why daddy went to Mass, because he did not follow the priest's directions.  She said he went because he needed to learn to do better.  His racist language decreased sharply after mom realized I was noticing.  When I was 9, on my birthday, mom had invited an older couple over for  dinner.  Her parents had died when she was 23 and this couple were like substitute parents to her.  I accidentally  pulled a corner china cabinet down on myself when mom asked me to set the table.  I had been sitting on the floor, taking the plates out of the bottom of the cabinet, and I put my hands on the sides of the cabinet to pull myself uo. The cabinet was pulled forward.  I was not hurt, but all the china and glass in the upper part of the cabinet was broken.    Dad was furious and sent me to my room without dinner.  The man said no one could tell him what to do in his home, and he forbid them to ever enter it again. Dad was the sole breadwinner, and mom did not contradict him.  What she did was after Sunday mass and the family breakfast, she took the 3 children over to this couples house and we all had a nice Sunday afternoon.  After a nice dinner, mom took us home at our bedtime.  We did this for Christmas, leaving Dad alone at home each time.  We spent Easter with this couple, Dad was left to his own devices.  Ditto for Easter Sunday.  We kids did not complain because we enjoyed this couple's company more than our uneven  tempered father anyway.  With no argument, mom kept seeing the couple as dad knew he had no control over her actions outside the home, and he NEVER wanted to be the sole adult in charge of his 3 kids.  He finally told mom the couple could come over when ever she wanted.  When I was 12 I heard Dad telling mom he did not want us to attend college.  He had not graduated from high school and was insecure that mom was better educated than he, and he did not want his children to be better educated.  Mom told him er children were going to attend college, either from an intact home, or with divorced parents, his choice. She went to work when my younger brother started kindergarten.  We all three attended college, with scholarships and mom's help.  My brothers and I paid for our Master's degree with no hello from her, and one brother also paid for his law degree after he earned his Master's  degree . Dad was impressed that my brother became a lawyer, he was indifferent to my career in teaching.  When I retired after 30 years, he asks why as he said teaching was not a real job.  I asked him how he would know as he had not been able to teach his kids any skill without yelling and losing his temper.  I cut him out of my life then and only saw him when he lay dying.  My regret was keeping him in my life past 1986.  kt.", "But reading the room requires effort, and being humble!", "There's something genuinely wrong with your thinking.", "No, but you can disagree like an adult.

Including her job and clothes. Most likely mom kept to herself and let everything she disagreed with out when op asked for advice.", "Manipulation with children as the playing piece is a slippery slope. I'd keep my kids out of that 1000%.", "Totally right?   And she says their issue is communication, yeah right my foot.   I'd be OP is the kind of communicator who thinks everything will be fine as long as you can be made to understand HER point of view.", "Marriage involves the whole person, though.", "To speak into the parenting portion: by putting the spouse first it shows the kids a stable relationship they can look to and trust to be there when they feel afraid. They are seeing the commitment of the parents to one another and know that the love between those two trickles down to them. It also shows them how to love their future spouse and children well. If all you focus on is the child, when the child moves from the house, the parents have grown, too, but not toward one another. All they know to do is to raise and please the child. They will be \"different people\" from whom they once were, with different passions,  drives, and desires. It is essential to demonstrate a loving, intentional relationship between parents, and to place priority there. Loving parents will never let their child starve, so the child will certainly not be left behind or neglected.\n\nOf course there are exceptions where the parents care about each other but not at all about the child,  but more than likely there is some sort of addiction at play, and is, as i said, the exception, and certainly not the rule.\n\nOK.
