{"id": 10454, "submission_id": "1177ia1", "title": "AITA for telling my neighbor to F off?", "selftext": "So it's quite a simple story. I have a PS5 and have been playing the new controversial game that released a few weeks ago. Fun times. My room doesn't have a ceiling light so I have a lamp. My dog knocked over the lamp and the bulb broke so now it gets pretty dark in my room. I open the windows so that light comes in. So my neighbor's kid seems to have walked by and saw me playing the game. I didn't really notice the kid (I say kid but he's really like 15 or 16). So anyway, seems the kid asked his mom to  get him the game or something. Neighbor came knocking on my door and I greeted them as I would have anyone else. She then tells me that her kid saw me playing the game and was wondering if I'd let her kid use my PS5 to play the game. I told her no, that I will not be letting her or her kid into my home. She got upset and said that I was being very selfish. That her and her husband can't afford to get her kid a PS5 right now. I told her that it sucks but to save up or wait until April when the game releases on PS4. My response upset her some more and said I wasn't being very neighborly. I asked her why on earth she would let her kid into her neighbor's home who she has never spoken to just so that her kid could play a game? I then told her to fuck off and shut the door. She left pretty much immediately. I told my mom about it and she said I could have been nicer (my mom tries to be nice to everyone to a fault) and I told her that people like my neighbor can't be reasoned with so being nice will not work. So now I'm questioning it a bit. I would never have let her or her kid into my home but should I have been nicer? AITA for telling her to fuck off?\n\nEdit: to the handful of dudes who have messaged me about how Hogwarts Legacy ends, I already beat the game. You aren't spoiling anything. Being petty and annoying isn't going to help your cause.\n\nEdit 2: I already ordered a new lightbulb which I will be picking up after work!
