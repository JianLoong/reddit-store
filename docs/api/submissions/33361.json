I recently got put on doing dishes every other day, well she completely stopped cleaning and helping out. Her children, a 5 year old boy and a 1 year old boy, destroy the entire house. I have asked many times to rinse out the 1 year olds sippy cups   (we will call him Jake) but she will bring out a ton of jake\u2019s sippy cups from her room and they will be molded and solid. Or by the next day they will be curdled and disgusting. But recently there was a completely molded and solid sippy cup. I threw it away and asked her one last time to rinse them and that if she doesn\u2019t start rinsing them I will no longer be washing the sippy cups and she would have to wash her own child's cups. But a few nights later last night I washed the dishes and realized she left it again, so I left all 6 of his sippy cups in the sink for her to solve. She later came into my room screaming and asking why I didn\u2019t wash him with the other dishes I had explained that I warned her that if she didn\u2019t rinse them I won\u2019t clean them. But now almost all of my family is mad at me except my dad he\u2019s been saying its not my fault and she needs to take care of it on my own.

Is your sister doing other stuff around the house?\n\nBut NTA. It is a short request. And that you have to clean out moldy cups is not reasonable. Also it is unhygenic for the toddler. Maybe talk to your family like 'I'll clean all the dishes but not moldy ones. I think this is unhygienic for my nephew and I don't want to risc his healt, because I don't think I can clean them enough. This said, I will throw away every moldy cup from now on' - and if they don't listen, throw them away (in a clean and otherwise empty garbage bag, so they could get them back. If it is the favourit cup of Jack or so)", "Nta, she sounds entitled and narcissistic. As a mother myself, it\u2019s my job to wash my son\u2019s cups and plates. She should know the same.", "NTA. You are not a maid. Stop doing anything more that your FAIR Share. So if there are 3 adults that don't pay the bills, you will do dishes every 5 days. And never do anything directly related to them so no cleaning their rooms or doing their laundry. You are not a slave, not a maid and those kids are not your kids and you have no duty to care for them.", "NTA He's not your child so his sippy cups aren't your responsibility.", "NTA, that's fn disgusting. Hopefully your dad can talk some sense into the others. Continue refusing, you shouldn't have to wash his sippy cups anyway, the boy has 2 parents to do that.", "NTA. Taking your fair share of household chores is a good thing. But that does not make your sister exempt from doing basic things like rinsing sippy cups when she puts them in the sink. She is the one who is not participating in the spirit of sharing household duties in a responsible way. Stick to your guns!", "NTA.  That's incredibly rude to leave that mess for someone else to deal with.  And sippy cups are typically plastic, so the idea of re-using a plastic cup that's had mold in it is just gross.\n\nI have one solid rule about dishes at my house, that I share with my partner and 16 year old grandson.   If you use a dish, you rinse it out before you leave it at the sink.   I wouldn't leave dishes for someone else to do, but I have been known to interrupt the child's video games to come rinse off dishes for me.  At this point, he just stacks them up in his bedroom for a few days and then does one major rinse session (although periodically I have to point out that the rest of us would really like to have plates to use, so it's time to gather up his dishes, LOL).  \n\nAnyways, I'm on your side.  It takes just a few seconds to rinse a cup out when it's been used, compared to the time it takes you to wash a cup that has solid gross stuff moldy inside it.  Glad your dad is on your side.", "She sounds like a terrible mother, where is the baby's father he is just as responsible.  NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s the parent, she can clean up her kids stuff.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if dishes are your part in the household chores, the state of the sippy cups when they\u2019re given to you is beyond what should be reasonably expected for that task. She probably wouldn\u2019t be letting them get that bad if she was the one who had to clean them, but because she can make it your problem instead she doesn\u2019t care.
