So after much consideration, fertility counselling and the proper medical and legal procedures we ended up using our friend Micheal as a known donor. \n\nMicheal had been a close friend of ours for 10 years by the time the donation occurred. We saw him regularly and came to know him as a stable, healthy, and productive member of society. He is also openly gay and doesn\u2019t plan to raise other children, which I think made us a good match.  We all talked at length about the role he would play in our children\u2019s life and came to the conclusion that although he will not any have legal rights or responsibilities, we will always be open with the children and others that he is the biological father and he will serve as another family member/mentor   in the kids life. (Kinda like an aunt/uncle or grandparent in a traditional family).\n\nLucy and Nora spend time with Micheal regularly and he is great with them. He really loves them and plays an important role in their lives but never over steps my wife and I when it comes to parenting. My wife and I also spend time with Micheal often as he is also part of our wider social circle. I\u2019m at peace with our decision to start a family this way and all thing considered it has gone very smoothly.\n\nHowever my wife and I recently got into an intense argument over where we should draw the line on Micheal\u2019s role in Lucy and Nora\u2019s wife. Lucy and Nora\u2019s school is hosting an after school Father Daughter Dance. As soon as I got the emails from the school I texted it to Micheal inviting him to go with Lucy and Nora. He said of course and that he was looking forward to it. When I told my wife this later in the day she became very angry with me because she believes we should be the ones experiencing the dance with our daughter not Micheal. I told her that it\u2019s a father daughter dance and Micheal is our daughter biological father not us. The dance is next week and because it is a small private school I worry it will be notable if they can\u2019t attend. I think Lucy and Nora attending with Micheal is by far the best solution. AITA for just wanting him to take the girl and keeping my wife and I out of it?\n\nEdit: To clear up any confusion, my wife and I are both cisgender lesbians. Also I tried to speak with my wife again about this situation but she\u2019s is still very angry. She said that in her words that I seem like I \u201cwish I married Micheal and not her\u201d. Which is obviously ridiculous. I dated men before I tried to make it work but was miserable. Not to mention Micheal is also gay so our marriage would be like a 1950s nightmare. I don\u2019t want to ask the girl for their opinion, because I don\u2019t want them to feel like they have to choose between their biological parent and my wife and I.", "created_utc": 1682955600, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134pwna/aita_for_wanting_my_daughters_to_attend_a_father/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have also discussed this with you wife before sending the invitation even though i agree with your side here, you should still ask first.  \n\n\n> As soon as I got the emails from the school I texted it to Micheal inviting him to go with Lucy and Nora.\n\nI actually changed my mind because of the above line. YTA. You were obviously not thinking that trough. Why wouldn't you discuss that first with your wife and co-parent? Thats baffling.", "Info; why are you placing so much importance on the word father? He's not a parental figure to them, on purpose, through your and your wife's choose. Are you the only lesbian parents in the school? Do the kids without a dad all miss this dance? I don't understand how you, on your own, decided Michael was the obvious choice here.", "I think YTA for not communicating about it with your wife before asking Michael. \n\nI don\u2019t have kids but I can\u2019t help but wonder, do the kids want to go with Michael as their father figure?", "YTA. You've turned your friend/sperm donor into a permanent third wheel. Your wife probably wants to raise your kids as a married couple, not with some dude showing up to appease heteronormative society.", "YTA.\n\nIt was actually nice of Michael to agree to be a sperm donor - but it's what he is. A sperm donor. Not their dad. You and your wife are the parents and Michael is a friend of the family. So why would he attend the dance as bio dad?\n\nI understand why your wife is so upset. You're basically telling her you don't see your family as a real one because there's no dad in it. You even want to stay out of the father/daughter dance. I mean. Wtf? Aren't you their parent too?\n\nBe the parent and go to the dance with your wife. I'm sure Michael will understand and back off since, you said it yourself, he don't want to overstep. And apologize to your wife too. Asking Michael without talking about it with her first was very rude.\n\nEdit: spelling as usual, it's hard to type on phone lol", "YTA I think your wife assumed y\u2019all would be raising these children not the sperm donor. How confusing for your poor kids", "Info: What does Lucy and Nora want?", "YTA for not discussing it with your wife before sending it to him. Sure he plays a close role in the family, but he is not a parent. I would take the dance as a parent - child dance and less of a man - daughter dance. Also, have you considered... asking your kids??", "Info- \n\nYou mention that it is a small private school. Is there an issue if either you or your wife took the girls? Would their be backlash if it was a female going to the dance?\n\nWhy didn't you discuss this with your wife before you asked Michael?", "I'm not sure how to judge this. But as a adopted child myself, I can say this much. If one of my parents all of a sudden said they weren't going with me to something because \"they're not my bio parent\" that would seriously hurt. YOU are their parents. Nowhere in your post are you saying that the school has an issue with you attending. So I am assuming they don't. So I'm a little baffled that this was your first reaction. \n\nAs of now, no judgement from me, because I honestly don't know what to say...", "the school is at the foundation of assholery here... specifically gendered events should not be a thing in 2023... what about single parent families? step families?  orphaned families? any other permutation of family that would somehow exclude children from the event because they don't have a cis-male parental figure in their lives?", "YTA. You see Michael as an aunt/uncle/mentor. Any involvement beyond that or have him acting as a parent should be discussed between the girls\u2019 actual parents.", "I'm going with softly YTA. My wife and I have our daughter in a Catholic school, and the administration has been supportive of us from the beginning. You are the parents, and your girls should be able to experience that at school as well as at home.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Michael is a SPERM DONOR. A DONOR. **NOT THEIR DAD.** Stop treating him like a parent without being on the same page as your wife.", "YTA - for making a unilateral decision\n\nThe school also sucks for making this gender based dance - when I can guarantee your daughter won't be the only one without an actively involved father in their life - whether down to bereavement, choice or abandonment\n\nIt seems like you want Michael to have no rights or responsibilities - unless you want him to have them\n\nWould I be correct in thinking you are the other biological parent of the girls? If so I can see why your wife is so upset - because it comes across as she isn't an equal parent to you, in your eyes", "If you were a single parent of a donor conceived child (which I am, fwiw) I'd say N TA. If you want to have Micheal act as a father and everyone involved was happy, great. Personally I specifically didn't want  the donor to have any role but this is super personal.\n\nThat's not your situation though. You've ignored your kids' actual other parent's views and chosen to go back on the agreement you had about Micheal's role. That's not fair on anyone, and YTA.", "YTA.\n\nYou made a decision for your entire family without discussing it with anyone. \n\nYou didn\u2019t consult your wife, who perhaps felt strongly about being the parent present at a dance meant for parents.\n\nYou didn\u2019t consult your children, who perhaps would choose having their parents there or not going over your solution. (Do they even want to go in the first place?)\n\nYou just\u2026decided, for everyone, that your understanding and comfort level when it came to this dance was universal.\n\nYour children have a biological father. They aren\u2019t being raised by a father. By making this decision for them you are potentially sending a very harmful and toxic message. Do you really want to risk teaching them that the man that you all have intentionally chosen not be a parent is, in fact, someone they should love and turn to as a parent?", ">I told her that it\u2019s a father daughter dance and Micheal is our daughter biological father not us.\n\nDo you not see how invalidating that is? Especially for a lesbian woman? To show that she is not the 'true' parent, that she always needs a man to have a 'true' family?\n\nWould you ask another lesbian couple to find the biological dad of their daughters for the dance, just because they are not the father?\n\nApologize to your wife NOW. And please, draw the boundary regarding parenting. Michael is NOT the third parent. He is the sperm donor/uncle figure.\n\nYTA.", "YTA because you didn't talk to your wife about it before asking the children's sperm donor.  You admitted you didn't want him to take on a father role yet you want him to take them to a father daughter dance.  You are being hypocritical.  How do you think other lesbian couples handle father daughter dances?", "YTA - It's nice that you have an open communication with your children's biological father. Them getting to know him and being able to spend time with him is fine...but it can also become very, very confusing to them if you allow him to step into any sort of parental role beyond the scope that you and your wife agreed on. \n\nThere is zero need for Micheal to be going to any sort of events involving fathers. He's the known donor, which is fine, but you're going to cause confusion with your children on his actual role in the family. At any rate, you and your wife have to be on the same page. You both have to agree, and your wife doesn't agree.\n\n(Though, honestly, schools need to get rid of these gender-specific events. Not everyone has a father or mother, or kids have shitty father/mothers and it excludes more people than they realize).", "YTA - what is yours and Michael\u2019s relationship like? Quite frankly, it sounds like Michael is a priority in your life, not your wife. It\u2019s giving the vibes that you view michael as your partner and your wife as an egg donor.", "YTA. It's 2023. Who cares if your family doesn't have a man in the father figure role. It would be completely appropriate for you and your wife to accompany the girls to this dance. Michael contributed to their DNA, but beyond that has no responsibilities to the girls. It's great that you keep him involved in their lives, but he is not their father.", "YTA your wife and you agreed that Michael would be a mentor and part of your children\u2019s lives. Michael is NOT their father, he is a sperm donor. You two raised those children and are their parents. Those dances, no matter how they put it, are for children and their parents. Michael has no business attending an event like that", "YTA you're treating Michael like a father and not like an uncle or family friend. At the very least this decision is something both parents should have made. You are giving him too much of a place in your kid's lives", "YTA your very first line says you and your wife have two daughters, that makes you their father, not the sperm donor.", "YTA for making this decision without having a discussion with your wife.", "YTA. You're these kids' parental figure. Who cares if it's father or mother or grand pubah. Go to the father daughter dance with your kid, even if you're a woman. Who cares. (hint, your kids care and want to spend time with you, not uncle Michael.)", "I feel like the school is predominately at fault here. It seems a little narrow minded towards those kids who don't have a designate \"dad\" \n\nGranted I can see why your wife might be peeved at you just automatically going ahead and messaging Micheal without discussing it with her first, but I also see why you wanted to include him. Biologically, he fits the criteria, you've always been open and honest with your kid about who he is.  Rather than denying his existence, you include him. Your kid is able to say \"yes I have a dad, here he is, I also have two moms who are my family and love me and we're all very happy\"", "YATA\n\nI'm really in disbelief your knee jerk reaction in response to the email invite wasn't to speak to your wife first. What WAS your thought process in excluding her from the decision to bow out as a parental duo in a party to celebrate parents and children and their relationship? \n\nAs a grown ass woman, dropped on my non-biological parents' doorstep at 3 days old, I'm telling you, YOU ARE Lucy and Nora's father. Biology shouldn't even be a consideration when celebrating a father/child relationship. Just because your daughters know Michael is their biological father, they know YOU and ONLY you to be their father. Of course Michael agreed to escort your children to the party since you've stated he actively participates in their lives. But you've also said it is an uncle type relationship and he respects parental rules and boundaries you and your wife have for your children. \n\nBottom line, DNA doesn't define mother and father. Stop denying yourself of fully embracing your fatherhood.\n\nEDIT: My deepest apologies for assuming OP is male and therefore father. In the whole situation, OP gender isn't relevant to being a childs' parent.", "NAH - Donor conceived families are complicated and come with complex emotions for everyone involved (just like every family, really). It seems like you are all trying to give your kids a safe, loving family, and you weren\u2019t trying to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. Your wife isn\u2019t an asshole for feeling hurt, and you probably should have talked it over before sending the invite. Your kids will not suffer for having _more_ love and support in their lives. It sounds like they are probably old enough to have their own opinions on who they want to attend the dance with.", "NAH - It sounds like Michael is a big part of your lives, and you have good reason to want to involve him in this part of those lives. At the same time, your wife is rightfully upset at you making this decision unilaterally without her, something  that it's understandable you may not have anticipated.\n\nI suggest that you have a discussion with your wife about just what role you both want Michael to play in your daughters' lives, and it's probably only fair to involve Michael in that discussion too, since at this point he already *is* involved. Try to see if the three of you can reach an amicable agreement.", "NAH. In the future, you, your wife, and then Lucy and Nora, need to have a discussion about how to handle these situations in the future.", "So he has no legal responsibilities/parental rights for these girls but he can go to a father/daughter dance with them.\n\nYTA and sending mixed messages.

Sounds like a misunderstanding between you and your wife.", "NAH. But you seem confused. It\u2019s a Parent-Daughter dance. Not an Uncle-Daughter dance. Michael might be the biological father. But he\u2019s not the daddy. You and your wife are both daddy and mommy. You\u2019re the parents. So you should go. And you should also talk to your wife before involving your friend so much", "YTA. I assume the daughters see you as their father, but this makes it seem you don't see them this way\n\nEdit: I'm an idiot. Didn't see that OP was a woman. Should have asked the kids what they wanted though", "NAH I can see why you\u2019d want to ask him, but you should have discussed it with your wife and even the kids. You and your wife are the parents. He\u2019s the sperm donor/mentor/honorary uncle. That\u2019s the not the same as being a parent. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s biologically related to the girls are not. That is not what makes someone a parent.", "NTA - he is the bio father but this is so close to NAH", "I think you are NTA.", "YTA While it was nice of you to think of Micheal YOU are Lucy's and Nora's father. It should be you and not Micheal. Lucy and Nora would probably prefer their father (you) at their father daughter dance.", "[deleted]", "YTA.  You are the girls' father.  Michael is a sperm donor, he is not their father.  You and your wife are their parents.  I mean, do you plan on having Michael walk the girls down the aisle when they get married?

Still think you and your wife should be there, and your elementary school sucks for doing this.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s like you said, he\u2019s the father. He\u2019s involved in their lives and has an important role. You say he doesn\u2019t overstep so there\u2019s no need to draw any lines. His role doesn\u2019t diminish either of yours.", "NTA, but the school should be more inclusive, and that should be fed back to them.

If any of the parents go with the biological \"every kid has a mommy and a daddy\" line it can be easier to get their offspring to accept that \"yes, they're right, and I also have a second mom who loves me very much\" than to explain that \"no, although I'm related to this person they're not my dad I only have two moms, your parents are wrong.\" those are some big concepts to throw at some 5 - 8 year olds.

It's hilarious and sad that OP erred on the side of caution for the sake of antiquated gender roles more than the feelings of her wife.\n\nChances are, the school won't bat an eye at a mother dancing with her daughter.

But knowing that our family didn\u2019t fit the heteronormative mold, and that at times that can bring both danger and unwanted attention, what we all wanted and were comfortable with was always something we openly talked about.

It would be easy enough for OP and wife to bring up the dance and see what the kids are expecting without saying \"you must choose between us or michael\"  Talk to them about their dresses and their hair and their favorite songs and get them talking.", "Yeah. The real AHs are the school for having this dance in the first place. There are so many problematic scenarios that can play out. Lack of fathers/ father figures or kids feeling pressured to go to a dance with a father or father figure that is abusive or that they just don\u2019t like, etc..\n\n Not to mention I just think it\u2019s weird to go to a dance with your dad.

All of your friends know you have two moms, they\u2019ve probably met your moms, and you show up to a dance with some dude? What a hard conversation for an 8 year old to have to maneuver at a dance.

If your intention is to have Michael serve as an extended family role like an uncle, why is he being given a father role here? Are you going to carry this through to other aspects of their lives? What do you do for Father's Day? If your daughters get married, would you expect them to ask Michael to walk them down the aisle?\n\nYour daughters can be raised to know the importance Michael played in their lives and value that, and his relationship to your family, without treating him like an occassional father figure. That starts to complicate things a bit. It sounds like you're expecting your daughters to see him as a family figure most of the time but a father figure some of the time, when it's convenient. Is that right? Bc that's not a healthy dynamic-your kids are soon going to be unable to twll what to expect from their relationship with Michael. It's got to be confusing for them to be told \"here's Michael, he's the one who gave us the privilege to have you two. You're biologically related bc two women  an't have children together, but he's not your dad. He gave us the gift of raising you and loving you, so we're your parents, but aince Michael is so important, he's like extended family to us. Oh, except during times when we want him to act like your dad, like when there's a father-daughter dance or other activities like that. But otherwise, he's not your dad, okay?\"\n\n>I am frustrate with how insecure my wife is about Micheal. She acts like I want to get divorced and run off with him and our daughters.\n\nIt's hard to know how valid her concerns are without knowing more about your relationship through the years. Honestly, from this post alone, I'm a bit inclined to agree with her. You agreed together what role and boundaries Michael would have within your family and yet you went behind her back and explicitly handed him an opportunity to fill in the role you said he wouldn't have. I, too, would be suspicious about why you immediately offered Michael the role inatead of discussing it with your wife to see who wanted to go. Do you even know if she wanted to go in place of a father?", "Thank you for your input. I appreciate being able to learn from different perspectives.  However, I would challenge on that I am being \u201cheteronormative\u201d. I think the very fact that I\u2019m in a 16 year partnership, now legally married and raising two donor conceived children with another women shows that I have embraced a non heteronormative lifestyle. That being said there is a difference between being heteronormative and acknowledging the reality the Micheal is our daughters biological father. I would love to have the experience of going to a school dance with the girls but I never want to try to replace or over step into a father role when they have a biological father.", "He is NOT their father!! He is a sperm donor! You are their parents!", "You can't overstep or replace a father role when there's no father role in the first place. The fact that you even said that is incredibly unfair and invalidating to your wife because it shows that you never see the two of you as the 'full set' of parents and another man is needed.\n\nThat's how I interpret your action as heteronormative, despite your relationship status with another woman.\n\nThere is a difference between acknowledging that Michael is the biological father and allowing him to overstep into the father role, which defeats the purpose of him being the sperm donor. You're making him the third parent and it's unfair to your wife and possibly him as well.\n\nImagine if you're a straight couple and needed to use a sperm donor. And then you tell your partner that he is not fit for the father role because he is not the biological father of his daughters. Or if you're the man in question and you tell your daughters that you're not their 'real' dad because they have a bio dad. Both scenarios would make you very much the AH.\n\nYour wife is telling you how she feels. From your edits, it's clear that she feels very, very invalidated as a parent and your partner. You need to see from her perspective and understand that you are not being fair to her by placing so much importance on biology and Michael. \n\nYour reasons for not wanting to date men and marry Michael mean nothing to her at this point, because the reality is, you have made Michael a part of your nuclear family when he's not supposed to be. Sperm donor means sperm **donor**. Not parent."]}
