So after much consideration, fertility counselling and the proper medical and legal procedures we ended up using our friend Micheal as a known donor. \n\nMicheal had been a close friend of ours for 10 years by the time the donation occurred. We saw him regularly and came to know him as a stable, healthy, and productive member of society. He is also openly gay and doesn\u2019t plan to raise other children, which I think made us a good match.  We all talked at length about the role he would play in our children\u2019s life and came to the conclusion that although he will not any have legal rights or responsibilities, we will always be open with the children and others that he is the biological father and he will serve as another family member/mentor   in the kids life. (Kinda like an aunt/uncle or grandparent in a traditional family).\n\nLucy and Nora spend time with Micheal regularly and he is great with them. He really loves them and plays an important role in their lives but never over steps my wife and I when it comes to parenting. My wife and I also spend time with Micheal often as he is also part of our wider social circle. I\u2019m at peace with our decision to start a family this way and all thing considered it has gone very smoothly.\n\nHowever my wife and I recently got into an intense argument over where we should draw the line on Micheal\u2019s role in Lucy and Nora\u2019s wife. Lucy and Nora\u2019s school is hosting an after school Father Daughter Dance. As soon as I got the emails from the school I texted it to Micheal inviting him to go with Lucy and Nora. He said of course and that he was looking forward to it. When I told my wife this later in the day she became very angry with me because she believes we should be the ones experiencing the dance with our daughter not Micheal. I told her that it\u2019s a father daughter dance and Micheal is our daughter biological father not us. The dance is next week and because it is a small private school I worry it will be notable if they can\u2019t attend. I think Lucy and Nora attending with Micheal is by far the best solution. AITA for just wanting him to take the girl and keeping my wife and I out of it?\n\nEdit: To clear up any confusion, my wife and I are both cisgender lesbians. Also I tried to speak with my wife again about this situation but she\u2019s is still very angry. She said that in her words that I seem like I \u201cwish I married Micheal and not her\u201d. Which is obviously ridiculous. I dated men before I tried to make it work but was miserable. Not to mention Micheal is also gay so our marriage would be like a 1950s nightmare. I don\u2019t want to ask the girl for their opinion, because I don\u2019t want them to feel like they have to choose between their biological parent and my wife and I.", "created_utc": 1682955600, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134pwna/aita_for_wanting_my_daughters_to_attend_a_father/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have also discussed this with you wife before sending the invitation even though i agree with your side here, you should still ask first.  \n\n\n> As soon as I got the emails from the school I texted it to Micheal inviting him to go with Lucy and Nora.\n\nI actually changed my mind because of the above line. YTA. You were obviously not thinking that trough. Why wouldn't you discuss that first with your wife and co-parent? Thats baffling.", "Info; why are you placing so much importance on the word father? He's not a parental figure to them, on purpose, through your and your wife's choose. Are you the only lesbian parents in the school? Do the kids without a dad all miss this dance? I don't understand how you, on your own, decided Michael was the obvious choice here.", "I think YTA for not communicating about it with your wife before asking Michael. \n\nI don\u2019t have kids but I can\u2019t help but wonder, do the kids want to go with Michael as their father figure?", "YTA. You've turned your friend/sperm donor into a permanent third wheel. Your wife probably wants to raise your kids as a married couple, not with some dude showing up to appease heteronormative society.", "YTA.\n\nIt was actually nice of Michael to agree to be a sperm donor - but it's what he is. A sperm donor. Not their dad. You and your wife are the parents and Michael is a friend of the family. So why would he attend the dance as bio dad?\n\nI understand why your wife is so upset. You're basically telling her you don't see your family as a real one because there's no dad in it. You even want to stay out of the father/daughter dance. I mean. Wtf? Aren't you their parent too?\n\nBe the parent and go to the dance with your wife. I'm sure Michael will understand and back off since, you said it yourself, he don't want to overstep. And apologize to your wife too. Asking Michael without talking about it with her first was very rude.\n\nEdit: spelling as usual, it's hard to type on phone lol", "YTA I think your wife assumed y\u2019all would be raising these children not the sperm donor. How confusing for your poor kids", "Info: What does Lucy and Nora want?", "YTA for not discussing it with your wife before sending it to him. Sure he plays a close role in the family, but he is not a parent. I would take the dance as a parent - child dance and less of a man - daughter dance. Also, have you considered... asking your kids??", "Info- \n\nYou mention that it is a small private school. Is there an issue if either you or your wife took the girls? Would their be backlash if it was a female going to the dance?\n\nWhy didn't you discuss this with your wife before you asked Michael?", "I'm not sure how to judge this. But as a adopted child myself, I can say this much. If one of my parents all of a sudden said they weren't going with me to something because \"they're not my bio parent\" that would seriously hurt. YOU are their parents. Nowhere in your post are you saying that the school has an issue with you attending. So I am assuming they don't. So I'm a little baffled that this was your first reaction. \n\nAs of now, no judgement from me, because I honestly don't know what to say...", "the school is at the foundation of assholery here... specifically gendered events should not be a thing in 2023... what about single parent families? step families?  orphaned families? any other permutation of family that would somehow exclude children from the event because they don't have a cis-male parental figure in their lives?", "YTA. You see Michael as an aunt/uncle/mentor. Any involvement beyond that or have him acting as a parent should be discussed between the girls\u2019 actual parents.", "I'm going with softly YTA. My wife and I have our daughter in a Catholic school, and the administration has been supportive of us from the beginning. You are the parents, and your girls should be able to experience that at school as well as at home.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Michael is a SPERM DONOR. A DONOR. **NOT THEIR DAD.** Stop treating him like a parent without being on the same page as your wife.", "YTA - for making a unilateral decision\n\nThe school also sucks for making this gender based dance - when I can guarantee your daughter won't be the only one without an actively involved father in their life - whether down to bereavement, choice or abandonment\n\nIt seems like you want Michael to have no rights or responsibilities - unless you want him to have them\n\nWould I be correct in thinking you are the other biological parent of the girls? If so I can see why your wife is so upset - because it comes across as she isn't an equal parent to you, in your eyes", "If you were a single parent of a donor conceived child (which I am, fwiw) I'd say N TA. If you want to have Micheal act as a father and everyone involved was happy, great. Personally I specifically didn't want  the donor to have any role but this is super personal.\n\nThat's not your situation though. You've ignored your kids' actual other parent's views and chosen to go back on the agreement you had about Micheal's role. That's not fair on anyone, and YTA.", "YTA.\n\nYou made a decision for your entire family without discussing it with anyone. \n\nYou didn\u2019t consult your wife, who perhaps felt strongly about being the parent present at a dance meant for parents.\n\nYou didn\u2019t consult your children, who perhaps would choose having their parents there or not going over your solution. (Do they even want to go in the first place?)\n\nYou just\u2026decided, for everyone, that your understanding and comfort level when it came to this dance was universal.\n\nYour children have a biological father. They aren\u2019t being raised by a father. By making this decision for them you are potentially sending a very harmful and toxic message. Do you really want to risk teaching them that the man that you all have intentionally chosen not be a parent is, in fact, someone they should love and turn to as a parent?", ">I told her that it\u2019s a father daughter dance and Micheal is our daughter biological father not us.\n\nDo you not see how invalidating that is? Especially for a lesbian woman? To show that she is not the 'true' parent, that she always needs a man to have a 'true' family?\n\nWould you ask another lesbian couple to find the biological dad of their daughters for the dance, just because they are not the father?\n\nApologize to your wife NOW. And please, draw the boundary regarding parenting. Michael is NOT the third parent. He is the sperm donor/uncle figure.\n\nYTA.", "YTA because you didn't talk to your wife about it before asking the children's sperm donor.  You admitted you didn't want him to take on a father role yet you want him to take them to a father daughter dance.  You are being hypocritical.  How do you think other lesbian couples handle father daughter dances?", "YTA - It's nice that you have an open communication with your children's biological father. Them getting to know him and being able to spend time with him is fine...but it can also become very, very confusing to them if you allow him to step into any sort of parental role beyond the scope that you and your wife agreed on. \n\nThere is zero need for Micheal to be going to any sort of events involving fathers. He's the known donor, which is fine, but you're going to cause confusion with your children on his actual role in the family. At any rate, you and your wife have to be on the same page. You both have to agree, and your wife doesn't agree.\n\n(Though, honestly, schools need to get rid of these gender-specific events. Not everyone has a father or mother, or kids have shitty father/mothers and it excludes more people than they realize).", "YTA - what is yours and Michael\u2019s relationship like? Quite frankly, it sounds like Michael is a priority in your life, not your wife. It\u2019s giving the vibes that you view michael as your partner and your wife as an egg donor.", "YTA. It's 2023. Who cares if your family doesn't have a man in the father figure role. It would be completely appropriate for you and your wife to accompany the girls to this dance. Michael contributed to their DNA, but beyond that has no responsibilities to the girls. It's great that you keep him involved in their lives, but he is not their father.", "YTA your wife and you agreed that Michael would be a mentor and part of your children\u2019s lives. Michael is NOT their father, he is a sperm donor. You two raised those children and are their parents. Those dances, no matter how they put it, are for children and their parents. Michael has no business attending an event like that", "YTA you're treating Michael like a father and not like an uncle or family friend. At the very least this decision is something both parents should have made. You are giving him too much of a place in your kid's lives", "YTA your very first line says you and your wife have two daughters, that makes you their father, not the sperm donor.", "YTA for making this decision without having a discussion with your wife.", "YTA. You're these kids' parental figure. Who cares if it's father or mother or grand pubah. Go to the father daughter dance with your kid, even if you're a woman. Who cares. (hint, your kids care and want to spend time with you, not uncle Michael.)", "I feel like the school is predominately at fault here. It seems a little narrow minded towards those kids who don't have a designate \"dad\" \n\nGranted I can see why your wife might be peeved at you just automatically going ahead and messaging Micheal without discussing it with her first, but I also see why you wanted to include him. Biologically, he fits the criteria, you've always been open and honest with your kid about who he is.  Rather than denying his existence, you include him. Your kid is able to say \"yes I have a dad, here he is, I also have two moms who are my family and love me and we're all very happy\"", "YATA\n\nI'm really in disbelief your knee jerk reaction in response to the email invite wasn't to speak to your wife first. What WAS your thought process in excluding her from the decision to bow out as a parental duo in a party to celebrate parents and children and their relationship? \n\nAs a grown ass woman, dropped on my non-biological parents' doorstep at 3 days old, I'm telling you, YOU ARE Lucy and Nora's father. Biology shouldn't even be a consideration when celebrating a father/child relationship. Just because your daughters know Michael is their biological father, they know YOU and ONLY you to be their father. Of course Michael agreed to escort your children to the party since you've stated he actively participates in their lives. But you've also said it is an uncle type relationship and he respects parental rules and boundaries you and your wife have for your children. \n\nBottom line, DNA doesn't define mother and father. Stop denying yourself of fully embracing your fatherhood.\n\nEDIT: My deepest apologies for assuming OP is male and therefore father. In the whole situation, OP gender isn't relevant to being a childs' parent.", "NAH - Donor conceived families are complicated and come with complex emotions for everyone involved (just like every family, really). It seems like you are all trying to give your kids a safe, loving family, and you weren\u2019t trying to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. Your wife isn\u2019t an asshole for feeling hurt, and you probably should have talked it over before sending the invite. Your kids will not suffer for having _more_ love and support in their lives. It sounds like they are probably old enough to have their own opinions on who they want to attend the dance with.", "NAH - It sounds like Michael is a big part of your lives, and you have good reason to want to involve him in this part of those lives. At the same time, your wife is rightfully upset at you making this decision unilaterally without her, something  that it's understandable you may not have anticipated.\n\nI suggest that you have a discussion with your wife about just what role you both want Michael to play in your daughters' lives, and it's probably only fair to involve Michael in that discussion too, since at this point he already *is* involved. Try to see if the three of you can reach an amicable agreement.", "NAH. In the future, you, your wife, and then Lucy and Nora, need to have a discussion about how to handle these situations in the future.", "So he has no legal responsibilities/parental rights for these girls but he can go to a father/daughter dance with them.\n\nYTA and sending mixed messages.

Sounds like a misunderstanding between you and your wife.", "NAH. But you seem confused. It\u2019s a Parent-Daughter dance. Not an Uncle-Daughter dance. Michael might be the biological father. But he\u2019s not the daddy. You and your wife are both daddy and mommy. You\u2019re the parents. So you should go. And you should also talk to your wife before involving your friend so much", "YTA. I assume the daughters see you as their father, but this makes it seem you don't see them this way\n\nEdit: I'm an idiot. Didn't see that OP was a woman. Should have asked the kids what they wanted though", "NAH I can see why you\u2019d want to ask him, but you should have discussed it with your wife and even the kids. You and your wife are the parents. He\u2019s the sperm donor/mentor/honorary uncle. That\u2019s the not the same as being a parent. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s biologically related to the girls are not. That is not what makes someone a parent.", "NTA - he is the bio father but this is so close to NAH", "I think you are NTA.", "YTA While it was nice of you to think of Micheal YOU are Lucy's and Nora's father. It should be you and not Micheal. Lucy and Nora would probably prefer their father (you) at their father daughter dance.", "[deleted]", "YTA.  You are the girls' father.  Michael is a sperm donor, he is not their father.  You and your wife are their parents.  I mean, do you plan on having Michael walk the girls down the aisle when they get married?

Still think you and your wife should be there, and your elementary school sucks for doing this.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s like you said, he\u2019s the father. He\u2019s involved in their lives and has an important role. You say he doesn\u2019t overstep so there\u2019s no need to draw any lines. His role doesn\u2019t diminish either of yours.", "NTA, but the school should be more inclusive, and that should be fed back to them.

I\u2019d think you\u2019d want to normalise things for them at school re. having two moms.\n\nI\u2019d just ask the girls who they want to go with if you AND your wife are in doubt. Otherwise it\u2019s time you listen to your actual wife and parent of your kids.

I never got to do those dance\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have a father growing up.", "NAH. but this should have been a discussion  with your wife and kids first. I have a friend in the same position and the bio father is very much like an uncle who does things like this as well.  But it is a discussion with open communication, and thats super important to make it work.", "Yeah the biggest thing here is **what do the kids want?**\n\nI think the way that OP and her wife have chosen to build their family is lovely and it's great that the girls know their bio dad as well. But I wonder, do they see him as an actual *father* /parent figure? Or is he more of a beloved uncle to them? Despite the great relationship, it would be understandable for them not to want to invite him to a daddy/daughter dance if they don't see him as a *dad* \n\nI know it's a small private school, but are there really no other kids whose parents are divorced, or perhaps one parent passed away or Dad just isn't in their lives? No other kid who might be showing up with mom, or a grandparent, or an uncle instead? \n\nRegardless, this is absolutely something that should have been discussed as a family first, even if the end result is still that Michael takes the girls to the event. YTA", "The speed with which OP brought in Michael makes me think she is still kind of running from these heteronormative pain-points. That\u2019s not good OP and your partner is rightly pissed, you need to sit down *with your partner* and work out your combined understanding of what your family is and how you approach and manage these kind of issues *together*.", "I think this is twos company threes a crowd and OP  is completely missing it", "I don't think it is a biological parent thing, I think OP as a woman feels uncomfortable attending.", "Yeah I found it pretty cringe but thought it was a cultural difference and I tend to be sensitive to gendered stuff, thanks for confirming that it's actually not ok.", "Thank you! I was going to comment on this as well. My hometown used to do \"daddy daughter\" dances. Now i think its called something like \"me and my gal\" so it covers everything. Same sex parents, steps, Uncles, family friends, etc. who ever might be close to the girl to go with them.", "I don't know. Whilst traditionally, they have been specifically father and daughter, in recent years they have just become parent and child events, but have just kept the old name.\n\nI suppose it's similar to how new mum groups have adapted to allow new fathers to join then where they are single fathers or the primary caregiver, due to the mother/other parents going to work/ not being in the picture\n\nIn this case, we don't know if it's specifically father and daughter only, in which case I would expect the OP to have gone, because they are the parent and not merely a sperm donor.\n\nThe AH is the OP because they don't realise that they are the father not Michael", "Well said!", "Came here to say this. \ud83d\udcaf", "OP is a woman. \n\nI think she wants to be her daughter's mom", "Are you really trying to teach a lesbian woman what a lesbian woman would feel?

Does that mean that other lesbian couples must find the biological father of their daughters for the dance?\n\nOP is allowing Michael to be the third parent even though he's just a sperm donor/uncle figure, and **her wife does not agree to it**. This is why using a known person as a sperm donor is almost always a bad idea.\n\nOP is still very much TA.", "Why would her daughters see one of their mothers as their father? Lesbians don't pretend to be men.", "No, OP is their mother.", "It\u2019s not about her not loving her daughters but feeling out of place as a woman in a daddy-daughter dance", "OP is her mother", "I think you misread, OP is female. I still agree with you though", "She's a woman.", "That may very well be the case. I just think it's a bit unclear what her line of thinking is. Hence the no judgement. But your absolutely right that that might be it. :)", "Thank you for pointing that out.", "Just because she is a lesbian woman doesn't mean she represents every lesbian woman. And clearly, she doesn't, since her wife is upset at her. And I can guarantee you that if she tells another lesbian couple to find the bio dad of their kid for the 'father-daughter dance', she'd be told to fuck off.", "Aye same, I was just going by the age ranges of the children involved, they're possibly a bit young to explain the whole donor / not really a parent thing to their peers or (in the case of those peers) to understand it, and you can't guarantee that every parent of every pupil is going to be willing or able to accurately explain the situation, so I was overly simplifying it. If any of the parents go with the biological \"every kid has a mommy and a daddy\" line it can be easier to get their offspring to accept that \"yes, they're right, and I also have a second mom who loves me very much\" than to explain that \"no, although I'm related to this person they're not my dad I only have two moms, your parents are wrong.\" those are some big concepts to throw at some 5 - 8 year olds. Keep it simple while they're little and then get into the whole donors and sexual preferences thing once they're old enough to grasp the notion", "It's still a \"father-daughter\" dance, not sperm-donor-daughter dance. Michael didn't raise them, take care of them, or have any sort of legal rights to them. Therefore, he's not their dad.

In the situation, the bio dad is already a part of their extended family. Other lesbian couple have no responsibility to do the same. \n\nThey can do whatever they want, there are NAH, but there is a misunderstanding that should be worked through. Quite frankly, I think the daughter\u2019s opinions should be factored in as much as the wife\u2019s opinion. \n\nI think it sucks that the school is pushing something gender normative like they are. However, the daughters might want to blend in for the dance instead of having their mom\u2019s there. Certainly something to be figured out by the family instead of strangers on the internet.", "Oh, I thought OP was a guy", "Oh crap, I missed that part.", "And I realized that and edited to say parent. Same sentiment regardless.", "Except that you don\u2019t represent every lesbian women.

OP just erred on the side of caution, likely not knowing why the \u2018father\u2019 is requested, and didn\u2019t want to put her daughter in an awkward situation.\n\nI\u2019d say NTA - the furious response of the wife isn\u2019t warranted, even if OP is in the wrong.", "Yes, thanks for clarifying your thoughts !", "Clearly, the wife doesn't agree. OP tried to push the extended family narrative without consulting her wife. There is a huge difference between uncle and father.\n\nSaying that there's a misunderstanding is highly, highly minimizing it. Imagine if you and your partner are using your friend as a sperm donor. You think that the friend is a nice uncle figure to your kids. Unbeknownst to you, your partner actually thinks of the friend as the third parent in this 'extended family'.\n\nSeeing that your original comment says OP would be TA if she was male in a straight couple, says a lot.", "Nowhere does it say the school is pushing heteronormative values. The OP immediately did, however immediately email the sperm donor before the other parent.", "So what if there are lesbian women who think like OP? Her ideals are still heteronormative and invalidating to her wife as a parent.\n\nOP is definitely in the wrong because she did not consult her wife. At best it's an E SH situation.\n\nHow can you not be furious when your partner suggests that you are not fit for a parental role in which the sperm/egg donor fits more than you? Straight or gay this is invalidating and insulting.\n\nAlso, different dancing roles don't have anything to do with actual gender in this day and time. It's hilarious and sad that OP erred on the side of caution for the sake of antiquated gender roles more than the feelings of her wife.\n\nChances are, the school won't bat an eye at a mother dancing with her daughter. Or if they do, it's not the kind of school OP should put her kids into. OP has her priority backwards.", "I can\u2019t distinguish narrative vs. reality from the post. I take OP at her word that bio dad is involved in the daughter\u2019s lives. \n\nI don\u2019t think there is a single correct resolution in this scenario (other than better communication with her family), so I\u2019m not going to judge anyone. If the OP was the father, there is a single correct answer for who goes to the father-daughter dance.", "I mean, they call it a father-daughter dance.", "It seems you don't even take OP's words seriously. OP said Michael will not any have legal rights or responsibilities, and he is involved as a mentor/uncle. OP's wife disagrees that Michael should take the fatherly role. So Michael is not the father in any sense other than DNA.\n\nThere also seems to be a double standard you have regarding lesbian couples and straight couples in your judgment. You seem to think that because there's no male parent in the relationship, another man can just overstep into the role of an existing parent.\n\nAt the very least, OP is TA because she didn't discuss it with her wife. That's irrefutable. The right solution is 1) OP or wife goes to the dance as the 'father' 2) don't go to the dance if the school insists on having antiquated gender roles.", "No.", "YTA, because you immediately texted Michael and not your wife first.", "Ok so I see a lot of people here with YTA views. However, after hearing you\u2019re a cisgender lesbian couple I better understand why you immediately messaged their bio father. You were trying to give  your children the opportunity to have as \u201cnormal\u201d of an experience as possible. I can appreciate the effort you put in. With that being said, the choice should have been left up to your daughters. They may want both your and your wife there to share in this moment, not their bio father. I can see why your wife is call you the AH, but I also see where you\u2019re coming from, and I  don\u2019t think it\u2019s from a place of malice. I would apologize to your wife, talk to the girls, and message back biofather if they girls want to go with you. Or better yet, maybe all three of you can go? (If that\u2019s what the girls want of course)", "NAH  yall have created a pretty confusing situation that doesn't have one correct way to handle. You did what I would also assume to be the logical thing to do. You and your wife are both mothers and the dance is not for you. My dad died when I was young and my mom never remarried, she (or I) would never have dreamed of trying to attend a father/son themed function in a father's place.", "YTA. At the very least you should have consulted your wife FIRST. Then your daughter second. Then Michael in the end. The problem here is that you keep seeing Michael as a \"father.\" He isn't really your daughters' father or parent, he's a DONOR. You need to straighten out his relationship and role in YOUR family or you risk confusing your kids. Although if they already think of him as their \"father\", then it's kinda late for that.", "NTA. Only going with that after the edit. I think it makes complete sense. He does have a relationship with the kids and they know he's their bio dad. It's a father, daughter dance (that's why I like when schools ask to pick different names for these dances because not everyone has a dad). Kids can be really mean and if you show up with a mom, they may say hurtful things to your kids. Can you all attend?", "YTA hes a sperm donor and you are their parents, its a daughter/parent dance regardless of the fucking gender.", "YTA", "YTA ask your goddamn kids. Michael is not their dad.", "Hey OP, I love the way you\u2019ve set up your family and the community you have to raise your kids. A very soft YTA because it seems like maybe you should have talked to your wife beforehand. It also sounds like there\u2019s a lot going on with your wife with regard to how she feels about you and Michael and his role in your life. Seems like it\u2019s time for counseling! \n\nI also think you need to learn how to involve your kids in discussions like this, if you give them the different options of who they could go with the only thing that would make them feel like they are choosing between parents is if a parent reacted negatively to their choice. \n\nI\u2019m about your age so this is decades old perspective but I had lesbian parents (slightly different situation my mom came out and divorced my dad when I was little, Dad was still very much in the picture.) But knowing that our family didn\u2019t fit the heteronormative mold, and that at times that can bring both danger and unwanted attention, what we all wanted and were comfortable with was always something we openly talked about. So yeah, I don\u2019t think involving your kids in the conversation is a bad thing.", "NTA.  You mentioned that the girls are excited to attend with him.  Your wife has the issue.  No one @me for my opinion.", "YTA\n\nYou should have asked your wife before making the call.\n\nAlso, I'm trying not to judge, but really... the set up you seem to have is really confusing. Heck, it seems like Michael's role in your family dynamic is a third parent. Literally... the way you elaborated made me think of him as a father figure and not at all just an uncle role.", "I mean, yes if parents don\u2019t want to attend, invite Michael. But so weird to offer the opportunity to Michael without checking to see if wife wants to attend herself?", "Agreed. It would be easy enough for OP and wife to bring up the dance and see what the kids are expecting without saying \"you must choose between us or michael\"  Talk to them about their dresses and their hair and their favorite songs and get them talking.", "Yeah. The real AHs are the school for having this dance in the first place. There are so many problematic scenarios that can play out. Lack of fathers/ father figures or kids feeling pressured to go to a dance with a father or father figure that is abusive or that they just don\u2019t like, etc..\n\n Not to mention I just think it\u2019s weird to go to a dance with your dad. Doubly weird if it\u2019s one of those ones that give out purity rings. \nThere are no mother son dances (outside of arrested development), are there?", "But OP's spouse may not be and OP didn't bother to ask, not did OP discuss w/ the girls as a family. \n\nOP not being comfortable going is one thing, OP aasuming everyone had the same gendered viewpoint she did and making a decision for everyone involved w/o any discussion is the AH part.\n\nThe school is having a father/daughter dance.

I\u2019ve seen many this year at schools in our area.\n\nI do agree that the school is the AH though.  I think a \u201cfamily dance\u201d or \u201cVIP and Me\u201c (basically bring anyone) or \u201cspecial someone\u201d is a better alternative.", "I agree. Totally inclusive!", "But what is the need for these at all? If there must be a school dance, why not have it involve just the kids who actually go to the school? Why can\u2019t they just have a party where everyone is invited?\n\nReal question.", "It\u2019s fun to invite family members/loved ones to an event at the school while the kids are young enough to actually want their loved ones there!  I think the event should be inclusive so the kids can bring literally any adult they want though.\n\nIt helps build community involvement, lets parents/guests see the kids in their environment, can build social networks, etc.  I think there are many benefits!  Also at the younger ages where the kids are into these dances, just kids would be difficult to supervise.", "Thanks for the response. I was truly curious bc we didn\u2019t have that at my school growing up. None of that would have appealed to young me.

You two need to decide what Michael\u2019s role is: donor, or father.

She is being unreasonable but you are TA for making a single handed decision like that.", "Can I just add here that the school organizer is a big AH-these father/daughter and mother/son dances are so problematic for many families-really not thinking about the kids who aren\u2019t \u201ctraditional 1950\u2019s Leave it to Beaver\u201d families.  Just have a family dance open to all kinds of families.", "NTA. \n\nI think this was a lovely opportunity for them to bond over this. \n\nBut given the response from your partner it might be better to discuss it first next time.", "The issue is less about you inviting Michael and more about the fact you didn't consult your wife before you did it. You made an important decision without consulting her and completely neglected her feelings or opinions on the matter. YTA", ">Edit: To clear up any confusion, my wife and I are both cisgender lesbians.\n\nMy whole thought up until this moment was \"what the actual F\". \n\nI think you probably jumped the gun. And you probably need to have a long discussion with your wife first about what role Michael plays in your family's lives, and then with him and your children. So overall, at the moment, YTA.", "Not just confusing but hurtful. Having been raised by two women, the daughters are clearly aware of the stigma of traditional gender roles, especially in the family. I would imagine their moms would have told them that it doesn't matter that they have two moms instead of a mom and a dad, and that it doesn't make their family any less valuable. They they *are* their parents, even if not biological ones, and that matters more. \n\nTo then be essentially told the opposite, that biological relationships are always going to matter more and their mom is willing to pass over her role as a parent just bc she doesn't meet the traditional gender expectation, has to be crushing. I have to wonder how that would affect how the girls see their relationship with their moms after that, and reconcile it with their own gender idemtities and expectations. \n\nIt's certainly not an action I would expect from queer person-surely she should know that gender norms don't matter, right?", "Also weird to offer it to Michael without asking the girls. All of your friends know you have two moms, they\u2019ve probably met your moms, and you show up to a dance with some dude? What a hard conversation for an 8 year old to have to maneuver at a dance. She probably doesn\u2019t even fully understand the bio sperm donor breakdown yet at that age.", "I mean they're not really the father given they're a woman too but I get your point", "Sure, all that\u2026 but you simply don\u2019t go out of your way to exclude non-traditional families. I\u2019ve seen \u201call parents and guardians welcome\u201d under the father-daughter part, and I\u2019ve never seen a father-daughter dance *at a school* that wasn\u2019t also a mother-son dance.", "I mean. I obviously agree with you, as my comment said.\n\nI don\u2019t even like a \u201cfather daughter dance\u201d that says anyone welcome.  The name itself should be inclusive."]}
