My brother has been refusing to go with my dad for a long time even when he does go he just sleeps there. I had always been jealous of him getting this opportunity and my mom knew. So today my mom woke me up early and asked me if I wanted to go with my father and learn everything. I immediately got up and said of course, so she told me to get ready and eat breakfast and that she would talk to my father right now \n\r\nI got excited and quickly got ready and when I went to eat breakfast my parents were also there eating breakfast and my mom said that my dad refused and said that he doesn't have the time to babysit me and that he is busy then he started ranting how my bro is coming with him today either. I\u2019m 17 and I actually want to go you think I\u2019m gonna blow my one time opportunity like this?\n\r\nI told my mom that the only reason he used the word \"babysit\" for me is because I'm a girl. When my brother was my age he was WAY more rowdy and tried to annoy our father but dad still wanted him to come. He has absolutely no excuse to not bring me while saying that who in the world will take care of the business after he dies if my brother still doesn\u2019t show interest.\n\r\nSo I got pissed at that and I told him that I'm the obvious choice but he is too blind to see it just because I'm a girl. And my mom got and said that I'm just trying to take my brothers opportunity by being mad and that the business will be inherited by my brother and not me so I should not get involved and that my bro will someday learn about the business. I got mad and started crying and left the room ever since my parents are mad at me and are not talking to me.

Go to school and study business. Let your brother drive your father\u2019s business into the ground. He made his choice. I\u2019m sorry, I know this is an awful feeling. It sounds like your mom is on your side, but she\u2019s not going to stand up to your dad. All you can do at this point is look out for your own future.", "There are lots of training programs for steel work. There are probably opportunities to look for other training options. If you want this, go for it and don\u2019t help your dad\u2019s business if he isn\u2019t going to train you. Maybe talk to your dad  and offer one more chance for one of you to learn the thing your brother doesn\u2019t seem to want to. Make your own way.", "I would talk to your mom. What was her point in waking you up? Did she expect your dad to be excited to have one of his kids there and when he wasn\u2019t, she switched sides ?\nAnyway, since even if you slaved in the business, it\u2019s was going to the son, who\u2019ll probably drive it to the ground, better to find this out now than later down the road and be an employee of your brother who get money and credit and you just do the hard work. Don\u2019t even argue with your parents about it or seem upset .\nFocus on your studies and get into college. Even if your parents won\u2019t pay for a girl to go to college, see if you can get scholarships by getting good grades, financial aid or even loans. Talk to your college advisor. You are seventeen and you have the whole world ahead of you, someone as determined as you can make it.", "NTA. Your brother is only getting priority as next in line just because of male preference and steel business is seen as a man's thing. For goodness sake, he's already 22! You'd think he would have a sense of urgency to prove his place.", "Tell your parents that they are being sexist, narrow minded jerks.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. My mom was the first female engineer at the steel mill she worked at just after getting her engineering degree in the 70s. The stories she tells of that time... She decided she'd rather get a business degree than spend the rest of her life enduring that. Looks like unfortunately, the steel industry hasn't changed much since then. \n\nThis is why we still need Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives. Because there are *still* so many barriers to women and minorities in so many industries.\n\nYou'll never be given the same opportunity as your brother because your parents are misogynistic. They will *never* see you as you truly are. Even if you did get the job, you would be scrutinized endlessly, and every little mistake that would have been forgiven if it were *his* mistake will be held against you.\n\nInstead, strike out on your own. Go to school, get a good education, and embrace your potential by finding people who will understand what you're worth and give you the opportunities you deserve. \n\nKeep an eye out for things that will make you marketable and impress people. For example, right now, generative AI is all the rage. Learn enough about genAI to be able to talk about its strengths and weaknesses, and people will eat it up. By the time you graduate, something new will have likely taken its place, so keep an eye out for whatever that is and learn enough about it to be able to talk about it. \n\nRight now, focus on your grades and on extracurricular activities. Look for scholarships for women wanting to go into business or industry. Take any leadership role you can get your hands on and excel at it. Whatever opportunities your parents fail to give you, find them elsewhere, and *more.* \n\nOnce you get to college, take advantage of everything the college offers for free-- writing seminars, resum\u00e9 help, etc. Even free counseling to help deal with your parents' bullshit.\n\nIf your parents won't support you monetarily through college, either find scholarships or considering doing a program where you go to a community college for your initial credits and then transfer after two years to a four-year college to finish out your degree. This is cheaper but still gets you a good degree.", "NTA, you\u2019re right. Your parents are misogynists. If I was you, I would start applying to trade schools (or college) now to make sure you have income ASAP. Make sure you\u2019re independent so that when your father can\u2019t work anymore, and your brother fucks everything up, you\u2019re not impacted or guilted into becoming the breadwinner for people who don\u2019t support you.", "NTA\n\nYour brother doesn't want this opportunity and your parents sound sexist and think you aren't good enough because you are a girl.\n\nI would probably look for work in a different steel plant and show them how capable you are.... but I'd be looking to move out when you turn 18 as your brother is clearly the golden child and you are just the second rated girl.\n\nIt's a harsh thing to realise.", "Oh heck no! NTA! Big time NTA! But you do know who is the assholes! And why the heck would your brother inherit it instead of you if he doesn't care about it and you do? Or at least why wouldn't it be split between you?! I don't know if you can possibly teach a person to not be sexist but if he doesn't change his tune, if it were me I'd move out and go NC as soon as I turned 18!\n\nP.S. I also think it's BS that your mom woke you up to go with your dad without asking your dad about it FIRST! How ignorant do you have to be?!", "NTA. \n\nSo to be clear the business would normally be left to the *both* of you. At least where I\u2019m from almost no one still leaves their estate/family business to one male primogeniture descendant, that is not how modern society or business works. Both of you should know how to run this business and, eventually, run it together alongside professionals that have been with the business/family for a long time now, because that\u2019s how normal people leave functioning businesses to their children. \n\nI recommend keeping on trying to learn the business and getting them to fund your schooling because it\u2019s clear your parents are backwards hicks living in the 15th century. Sorry not sorry. You have to look out for you first, *always*. They aren\u2019t going to. Get as much as you can out of them and, although it\u2019s fine to love and respect them and be thankful for what opportunities they are affording you, don\u2019t forget that they plainly don\u2019t see you as an acceptable heir, probably because of your sex and birth order both of which are outdated, prejudicial ways of looking at the world. \n\nThey\u2019d throw you under the bus for your brother\u2019s benefit any day of the week, don\u2019t give them the chance. Make sure your successes are firmly your own and not something they can just uproot from under you if it suits their current circumstances. Education is the best way to do that. Once it\u2019s paid for it\u2019s your\u2019s, always. A job with the company, a board position, saying you\u2019re the heir without showing concrete proof, all that can be taken away in an instant, but degrees you\u2019ve earned and certifications you hold are forever your\u2019s and always make you more employable. Don\u2019t expect them to change, fight for what you can get out of them and prepare for your future under the assumption that they might leave you nothing.", "NTA - Brother is not interested, so when dad passes, the business will go to the guy who just wants to game everyday. You can see where this is going. Dad passes, son inherits the business, business is then sold or shut down because bro doesn't have time for that or because bro doesn't know how to run it. Even if he did have a go, he will run it into the ground. I am guessing you are in an Eastern country? The things you said make it sound like you are in UAE or Asia Pacific, as I am aware women are second class there.\n\nI do not know how old you are, but is it possible for you to do a Business Management course or something? I think you should work towards the knowledge that bro is not going to stand up but you could IF you have the knowledge and skills.\n\nHave you talked to your brother about this? What does he think? You might find you are both on the same page and hopefully, you two could work it out that dad THINKS son is getting the business but once he inherits it, he signs it over to you, you pay him a little something each month in 'consultation fees' and he gets to stay home gaming whilst you get to own your own very successful business. Happy days all round :-)", "NTA.\n\nYour parents\u2019 behavior makes no sense. Your mom woke you up without actually knowing whether or not your dad had invited you? Your dad claims you have a knack for the business and then turns around and says he can\u2019t \u201cbabysit\u201d you? What are they trying to accomplish, here? Do they want one of their kids to take over the business or not? \n\nThis is bizarre. I think you need to come up with a plan B. Your parents have no idea what they want, and in the meantime, you have some decisions to make about what your first few years of adulthood will look like. You can\u2019t count on this business to be your career.", "To bad their going to lose the business because of this. Dad is the ah", "Sucks to suck I guess."]}
