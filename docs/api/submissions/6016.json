I met them in the summer after we moved to be near his family now that he's finished with college. We're getting married in February and we're expecting our first child together in May. Being someone who has no family and seeing how close his family was, I wanted to make sure I showed my appreciation for them with the gifts I gave so I tried to get something each person would love. One of his sisters loves to read and so I made a book sleeve for her with little details from all her favorite books. One of his nieces is on the spectrum and has wanted clothes for her stuffy, so I made some clothes for her to put on the stuffy. I bought his mom a jewelry box that she had admired a couple of times after she mentioned never having a real one. For his dad I bought him a frame for his office big enough to hold photos of his whole family on, since he always complained he couldn't find one big enough or nice enough, and had no more room for individual frames. I included photos Noah had provided me in it. I got his other sister her favorite makeup which she mentioned she couldn't afford to buy lately. Then I got his brother a signed piece of memorabilia from his favorite sports team. For the rest of the nieces and nephews, I bought wish list items the parents weren't getting.\n\nNoah thought they would love everything. He told me I didn't need to go to the effort I did (I spent weeks tracking everything down and searching for certain items) but he really thought they'd like them. But when Christmas Day happened I could tell something was off. I spent the whole time worrying that I had bought them stuff they didn't like anymore or something. They said nothing. But then the next day they asked Noah what the hell I was thinking and I was like some kind of stalker buying them such personal stuff when I'm an almost stranger to them. The next day we saw them again and I apologized for the gifts I gave them and told them I would be a lot more mindful in the future. I offered to make it up to them. One of his sister's called me a stalker to my face and told me it was no wonder my family didn't want me if I was so creepy to do stuff like that. Noah yelled at her. I apologized again and told them I didn't want to hurt anyone and I would learn from this. They told me I had overstepped. Noah said we were leaving and they owed me an apology. I feel so bad. Noah is supporting me and told me I did nothing wrong. But surely there wouldn't be so much offense if that were true. I need to ask AITA?\n\nAlso, not sure if this is relevant or not but I grew up in an unhappy home. My parents were unkind to me and my sister. She was much older and also hated me. I think maybe because of how our parents treated her. But I ended up with nobody who wanted me by the time I was 16 and I was homeless for a good period after that. That's what Noah's sister meant. I had told them honestly when they asked.\n\nETA: I wanted to clarify something that might sound strange. I had spoken to them on the phone before but we had not met in person until this year. With Covid and us living in a different city at the time I had not gotten the chance. But they were genuinely all close before this.\n\nSorry for another edit! I just wanted to clarify that we had met in person before Christmas, and more than once too, but I feel like I messed up expressing that here. I met them for the first time in the summer. Also, since people have been asking, they got me gift cards and they did not return the gifts.", "created_utc": 1672415644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz3u09/aita_for_getting_my_fiances_family_gifts_that/", "score": 713, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your gifts sound very thoughtful and you ran them by Noah. Not sure what's going on with his family but in the future you can save a lot of time getting generic gifts.", "NTA. While tailored to their interests, none of those gifts seem particularly personal to me. They are obviously based on what your fianc\u00e9 told you they liked.", "This is really sad. You went above and beyond for the family of your fianc\u00e9, and you were met with distrust and mocking. NTA\n\nThat\u2019s hard to get over, glad your fianc\u00e9 is standing by you. I\u2019d distance myself from his family asap!", "NTA\n\nAnd if my son ever brings home someone so considerate and sweet, I will make sure he knows she's the best woman he can ever hope for, and he better treats her like the angel she is!\n\nI can't get behind people who don't want nice gifts. I would be happy to be seen in my interests and/or needs.\n\nNot your fault.\n\nAlso Noah sticking up for you is great. He knows why he loves you, for sure.", "NTA! Getting gifts they actually mentioned and paying attention to things they said to buy gifts is thoughtful, not stalkery. What the heck is wrong with these people?  They'd rather get an impersonal gift they don't care about??", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t overstep. You actually did exactly what most families want new in-laws to do when it comes to gifts. His family is way out of line - from their reaction, accusations, comments, all of it - and I\u2019m glad he saw it even if you didn\u2019t. \n\nWork on finding your backbone. Sounds like with this family as in laws you\u2019re going to need it.", "Nta: these are sweet thoughtful gifts. They are toxic.  I see you want to blame yourself and I'm telling you right now that what you did was sweet, not creepy and their reaction was completely out of line. You are joining their family, which makes it even more out of line. Apparently, you're a stranger to them and they don't want you in their family then I guess rheyre not gonna have a close relationship with ther grandchild", "NTA- this is so incredible to me. You went out of your way to make Christmas special for them and to give them things they\u2019ve been wanting or needing for years. You worked along side your fianc\u00e9 to make sure you got them thoughtful gifts. \n\nIf they think so much consideration is an issue\u2026 they must have a pretty miserable relationship with one another. Guess they\u2019ve gotten used to generic scarfs, gift cards, and chocolate", "NTA You actually \"listened\" to them and made mental notes along the way... even if you had never met them. Your gifts were very thoughtful. I'm glad your fianc\u00e9 is so supportive of you and stands up for you. He sounds like an outstanding guy. Your in-laws on the other hand, total butt wipes. They could become a problem in the future. Stay away... and stop apologizing for being a decent human being who actively listens to others.  Congrats on the baby and best wishes to you.", "NTA \n\nAs a booklover, if you gave me a personalized booksleeve like that, I would probably cry.

My SIL went way overboard our first Christmas together. She got me way too many presents and spent way more money on me than I did on her. I just felt a little awkward that I didn\u2019t match what she did, but I can\u2019t imagine saying something like that. I recognized she was just trying to make a good impression.", "NTA... Their reaction is very strange. It's great that he supported you. I'm wondering if it's about something else though. Ask Noah what it's all really about.", "NTA.

Maybe if they knew they would not have been so rude, disrespectful, etc\u2026 I mean you are marrying their son so kinda weird for their reaction to be what it was.", "NTA.  I find your fiance's family reaction very odd.  It sounds like you are very observant, a good listener, and wanted to do something nice for them.  The sister also sounds very nasty - what a cruel thing to say.  I'm glad Noah is supporting you.", "NTA. You are amazing, and are an amazing gift giver. I don\u2019t understand why your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family feels threatened by you\u2026 and why they are so ungracious in how they received the gifts.

This is their problem, not yours.", "NTA it\u2019s normal to listen to what people want and get it  for them.

What an odd reaction.  You are not a \"stranger\", you are marrying their son (brother) and will be the nother of their grandchild.  Im assuming they were just overwhelmed and maybe embarrassed if their gifts to you were not so thoughtful.  But glad your husband supported you.", "NTA I\u2019d be thrilled if my new SIL got me personal gifts like that. It means they actively listened during our conversations or to my daughter. If I went to the trouble of finding these gifts and others responded this way, they\u2019d forever get gift cards in the future.", "NTA. You sound really great and they should have been more friendly and empathic.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine being upset about someone trying to give a thoughtful gift to me. You put in effort but they weren\u2019t overly personal. I honestly cannot figure out why they were so bothered. Good for Noah for sticking up for you.", "NTA they were looking for a reason to push you away- thoughtful gifts is just what they chose. You did nothing wrong, Noah is right.", "NTA.  If someone took the time to track down something that months earlier I mentioned I liked I would be surprised as people don\u2019t tend to pay that much attention.  However, I would not be angry, in fact I would be very touched by their thoughtfulness.\n\nThey overreacted, were rude and refused your apology (which you did **not** owe them BTW).  What blows my mind is they yelled at and belittled a pregnant woman \u2026 who is pregnant with their grandchild and niece/nephew.  \n\nGosh, I don\u2019t know where you go from here.  OP I don\u2019t think his family is as wonderful as you think they are.  I think going LC for awhile is in everyone\u2019s best interest.", "NTA my MIL buys me pyjamas 3 sizes too small and crap from the dollar store I won\u2019t use. Presents should show thought and consideration, which yours did. You\u2019re engaged! It\u2019s not like you are a door to door salesman or something.", "NTA\n\nThere gifts are not remotely \"stalker\" territory. (When I saw the headline, I thought we were in for a tale of woe involving gifted sex toys!) These are sweet, appropriate, personalised gifts to the recipient. And you're not a stranger to them. They're going to be your in-laws.\n\nKudos also to your finace for supporting you. As I said, they're going to be your in-laws. I'm afraid they may have shown their true nature to you. Even if they disliked the gifts, reacting this way to a gift is extremely rude. You may want to have a candid conversation with your finace about how to handle them going forward.\n\nFinally, stop apologizing for the gifts. Apologies are for when you have wronged someone. You did nothing wrong. They should be apologizing to you.", "NTA. It sounds like to me that they were trying to find an excuse to hate you. It might be best not to buy or make anything for them in the future. Save yourself the headache and heartbreak.", "Tell Noah's entire family to give the gifts back then! You went above and beyond for his family,  for them in return to call you a stalker! Hell nah I want all my gifts back! Did they gift her anything?", "NTA, like this is some weird shit. You really put an effort into gifts and this is their response?\nNo matter how long i will live i will never understand human beings.", "You are really sweet and i would love to have you as my sister in law. I am sorry. You are not the asshole, you are wonderful.\n\nNta", "What an insufferable bunch, I know is not funny but the \u2018over the top\u2019 reaction made me giggle (it was a very bizarre reaction). Me in your shoes, no more gift from my part, I\u2019ll be pleasant and cordial but would keep them to arms length. Your intentions were good, and by your SIL\u2019s comment of your family they\u2019ve already made prejudiced assumptions about you before this whole fiasco, that\u2019s out of your control and not your fault. Now that you\u2019re becoming a mom with this family you better grow a backbone. Props to your fianc\u00e9 for defending you. NTA", "NTA dont waste your energy on these people. Im glad your fianc\u00e9 has your back.", "NTA. Ask for the gifts back and never give them anything ever again under any circumstances. Their reaction was cruel and honestly insane. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I'm so confused. You got them thoughtful gifts and they were mad about it? They would have preferred gift cards or stuff they didn't really want? They sound like miserable people. Sorry that happened to you. It's 100% them, not you.", "NTA. I am so sorry your thoughtfulness was taken so so horribly. These people sound awful. Good luck with the rest of your life with these in laws. I like what someone else said, that they practically wanted to hate you. If they were close before covid and then you came along and you\u2019re having his baby, you couldn\u2019t lassoed the moon and they\u2019d still find something wrong with you. FWIW I have literally stalked ppl (online) to get an idea of what gifts to get them.", "Noah\u2019s family are rude, ungrateful assholes. And cruel to boot. Who says something so cruel to someone when they know they had an unhappy childhood/family life. I\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 has your back but please be aware that you will have to deal with these assholes for your entire married life.  Might be a good idea to establish some boundaries now. \n\nNTA. Also, I\u2019d be delighted by such thoughtful gifts.", "NTA. I think it's a red flag for some of those family members to have responded so cynically.\n\nTo most normal people, you getting them gifts based on what you know about them would be a sign that you want to establish a good relationship with your new family.\n\nBut their reaction might be a sign that they are negative or even toxic people. I'd be careful/cautious about future family gatherings if I were you.", "NTA, at all whatsoever. This is so wonderful and thoughtful. I'm sorry they didn't appreciate it.", "NTA at all!!  They sound like ungrateful jerks to be quite honest.  They are huge AHs - so glad your fianc\u00e9 is supporting you.  Stop apologizing- you have zero reason to apologize for your extremely thoughtful gifts.  They owe you an apology, you owe them NOTHING!", "NTA. Please don\u2019t question yourself on this. His family went overboard with their reactions. If they felt it was personal, all they had to do was ask: \u201cwow, how did you know?\u201d  Then it could\u2019ve been explained that Noah helped you make sure that each gift was thoughtful and tailored to each recipient. To react they way they did is beyond rude, bordering on bizarre. And his sister was WAY out of line. They should apologize to you profusely.", "Nta \nBut familiy of youre bf are ah\nYou sond like a really awsome person caring and loving every person could be happy to have someone like you in theire live", "NTA. That\u2019s so rubbish for you that they reacted like that it\u2019s so rude for people to be like that about presents. At least your fianc\u00e8 is supporting you, SIL\u2019s comments were way out of line.", "Wow, what a terrible way to repay you for those amazing gifts! They were not over the line personal, it just sounds like you put in a lot of effort. If I had been them, I would have felt bad that I had not gotten you as good a present as you had gotten me. Damn, can we do Xmas together next year? ;-)   \nThis family is wayyyyyy off, you are NTA and your fiance sounds like a great one. Cut the ties with that family, they are in the wrong, you are not.", "Nta.\nMaybe they are not used to anyone being so caring and mindful about others' interests or hobbies. They will regret it someday.", "honey, you're NTA.  any family with an ounce of empathy who knew your story would scoop you up as one of their own after you did something like this.  I'm glad your bf stood up for you, he seems like a keeper, and i hope your relationship with them gets better.", "NTA. The proper response to getting a gift is usually Thank You for thinking of me not What are you some kind of stalker?!?!?! The good part is your fiance' stood up for you and that is priceless. Next year get them dollar store mugs with $10 starbucks cards and call in a day. They are not worth your time.", "NTA but next year give them each a joint gift from you and your hubby. Give them each a $10 gift card for amazon. That way you have given them a gift (so they cant complain that they dodnt get anything), it's generic and to be honest $10 more than they deserve.", "NAH, except the sister. She\u2019s TA. The gifts were personal and thoughtful, but that could be off-putting when they don\u2019t know you and wouldn\u2019t have bought you those kind of gifts. It reads like you\u2019re trying way too hard. I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t have conversations with these folks over the months, so you had to have been going through everyone\u2019s social media accounts to ferret out all this information. That\u2019s probably taking things too far when you haven\u2019t met anyone yet. You aren\u2019t to blame because I think healthy interacting with a family is not something you have a lot of experience with, and I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re trying so hard to make a space for yourself that only time can create. \n\nBut what the sister said was inexcusable and incredibly mean. You shouldn\u2019t be willing to accept that from her. She owes you a much bigger apology for deliberate unkindness.", "INFO:  were the gifts from you and Noah or just from you?", "Noah should not have encouraged you to do that kind of gifting to his family, ~~who you have never met in person.~~ The sister is rude for calling you a stalker to your face and insulting your family relationship.\n\nNAH, but you're trying way too hard here to fit into this close family.  Relationships need to develop and grow naturally. I wouldn't be offended by your gifts, but yes I would find them very weird from a person I barely know at all.", "[deleted]", "NAH. \n\nI\u2019m going to go against the grain. \n\nYou put in some serious thought to get your family members really nice gifts. \n\nThe family is allowed to have their feelings. If they view the gifts as too personal, then they were for them. \n\nI think that you and your fianc\u00e9e should have signed both your names on the gifts though. \n\nI don\u2019t know why they are so upset, but I do know they\u2019re allowed to have their feelings about it. \n\nSorry this went in a negative way for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They could\u2019ve just said thank you and moved on.", "NTA - I'm sorry they didn't appreciate your effort. They don't realize how lucky they are to have you in their family. I'm glad your husband appreciates you.", "NTA your gifts were throughout and meaningful. I\u2019m glad Noah has your back. What a slap in the face to call you a stalker and say anything about your family to you. They\u2019re all probably embarrassed that you recognized, listened and remember things they wanted that they didn\u2019t think of or care to get for each other. You\u2019re a great caring human, please do not let these people think you did anything wrong. I\u2019m sorry his family treated you like this. Noah loves you and you are his family. every family has dysfunction and they aren\u2019t excluded from that, clearly.", "NTA, Man this is a really strange reaction. Especially with your BF telling you before hand that they're going to like their presents. I hope you're able to get to the bottom of what was so wrong. Then please update us I'm curious. Best of luck", "NYA. These are the kinds of gifts I love to give and receive. Why wouldn\u2019t you know a lot about them? You\u2019re engaged to their close family member. They\u2019re being ridiculous and don\u2019t deserve you as an in law. I hope your fianc\u00e9 stands up for you with his family.", "NTA you are an angel and they are psychos who clearly have no emotional intelligence or awareness. Take the only good seed, Noah, and run like hell.", "You made clothes for that little girls stuffy!! You are the best!! \n\nNTA\n\nThese people have got issues. What did they buy each other? I feel like maybe they do low effort gifting and might have felt shown up by your thoughtfulness? If so, that's about them not you.", "Holy heck, OP! You are NTA\u2026please don\u2019t think that you are, nor should you ever lose that beautiful and thoughtful nature you have. Just don\u2019t worry about being generous and thought with your in laws anymore\u2026..they just saved you tons of money and time.\n\nI am so glad Noah is supporting you throughout all this and I feel like a low contact or no contact decision might be in your future with his family. It is so unacceptable, rude, and uncalled for.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have apologized at all. You did nothing wrong.", "Nta, I bet they were embarrassed you remember that much and paid attention to them. They probably don\u2019t remember much from conversations or interactions. Smh\n\nDO NOT BLAME YOURSELF. You did nothing wrong. Anyone would be lucky to have someone who actually pays that much attention to them and can buy them a gift based on what they like.", "NTA I am so confused by this! I have always bought presents for people based on what I learn from them by listening to them when they speak or observing them. Now I am wondering if I have been freaking people out and maybe they would prefer more generic gifts.", "INFO: Did they keep the gifts?", "Uhhh\u2026 none of these things seem all that \u201cpersonal\u201d to me, so much as you just kept their basic interests in mind, which is normal. I think all those gifts sound lovely and were appropriate. \n\nNTA. I guess next year everyone can get generic lotion sets since they don\u2019t want anything related to their interests.", "Info: did they actually tell you those things personally over a conversation or you saw their SNS, or heard from your fiance? Ngl kinda creepy that you get them all exactly what they want, cos since you said you only met them once before and only have phone calls, but you can't be talking to everyone?", "My next gift for them would be the finger.", "I just hate that I have managed to cause problems in their family. Noah has always been so close to them and now this is coming between them.", ".... Honestly I think this is a faux flag. They say the issue is the too personal gifts- but something is making me feel like the actual issue is that OP opened up about having been abused and homeless.  \n\n\nThose things (especially being open so 'quickly' in their eyes) gave them a bad feeling and they've decided that OP is a bad person for making them feel anything Other Than Happy on Christmas and that OP must have /been/ a bad person for going through those things.  \n\n\nMaybe I'm just biased as someone who used to work in trauma recovery. But I've seen a lot of survivors mention relationships souring immediately upon opening up- even if the survivor wasn't asking for emotional support/etc. But my spidey senses are tingling.", "I bet they gift each other generic things like ties or perfume and always complain about \"what in the world can you gift someone who already has everything?\". Now they've been shown that it is possible to gift something meaningful and nice, and you don't even have to know the other person for years and years. They feel ashamed and are lashing out instead of being thankful. This is super low.", "Or nothing jeez. What did they get you, OP?", "They are aware. I had mentioned it because they had asked me about my family and especially when we got engaged and wanted to know if there was anyone from my side they should meet. There isn't, so I wanted to be transparent without going into all the uncomfortable details.", "Then OP is NTA", "Yeah, are the gifts offensive, or do they want to keep them, because they can't have it both ways.", "That seems to be what they expected from me, yes. Or maybe like small trinkets. I got gift cards from them. Clearly they felt that was more appropriate for the level of relationship and I feel so bad that I made it uncomfortable for them.", "Yep, Op is amazing, and I wish I was on her list. \n\nIf OP decides to still gift these people anything...$10 starbucks card for everyone... for everything. Graduation, wedding, holidays.... just an impersonal low-cost card. I'd do that for a decade if they never apologize. That and low contact \ud83d\udc4c", "I have been having conversations with them. We talked on the phone before we moved and I have seen them on several occasions since we moved and have actively tried to get to know them.", "Just from me. He got them gifts as well. But gifts are usually given by each member of the family (whether married in or biologically related).", "I had met them before Christmas. I met them for the first time a few months ago but I am still new to them, I know.", "If \"never meeting them in person\" is so pivotal, well, by that criteria, she shouldn't be obligated to get them any gifts at all.\n\nThe only appropriate response to a gift is, \"thank you, it's wonderful.\" If you secretly dislike it, don't use it, regift, etc. But you \\*never\\* attack the giver.", "How can you say N-A-H after what the sister said?", "Since when is a thoughtful gift unwelcomed ?  You are wrong to say that.  I think 99% of people would be happy to receive such gifts.  What was she supposed to get them ? Crap they don\u2019t need or want ?  OP don\u2019t listen to this nonsense.", "She is marrying their son and carrying their grandchild. Of course she is interested in them and wanting to do her best. She didnt get anything weird. and lots of people didnt meet until this year because of covid, they still spoke and videoed", "I had met them before Christmas. But I had not met them before we got engaged.", "I don't understand why people think this way. How does giving someone a gift that they couldn't get otherwise make you TA? Most people would be happy to get a great gift.\n\nMaybe I'm not understanding something but only really toxic people would get mad about something like that imo.", "Hahahahaha what an embarrassing take lmfao. \nNTA.", "The whole point of a wish list is so that people will buy presents off of it. I get one every year for my nieces and nephews. I ask their parents what they haven\u2019t bought yet and then I buy something off the wish list. Why in the world would this be a bad practice? It is literally why the list was created.", "Responding specifically to the quote you used - my SIL does this for my niece and nephew and has for years. She publishes the list to the whole family, and everyone marks off what they\u2019re getting for the kids so there are no repeats. I assume OP\u2019s in laws do something similar of OP had access to the list and knew what the parents were getting. This isn\u2019t weird at all, nor does it make OP the AH", "I see where you\u2019re coming from regarding the gifts being too personal from someone they don\u2019t know that well. However, the proper response to receiving a gift (even if you don\u2019t like it) is \u201cthank you\u201d. \n\nAttacking someone over their choice of gift is disgusting and vile. They could have simply said thank you and maybe pulled Noah aside and let him know that they were uncomfortable with the personal nature of the gifts.", "They\u2019re allowed to have their feelings about it but calling her a stalker makes them TA.", "Thanks for your honesty. I hate that I made them uncomfortable and have caused trouble between them.", "I strongly disagree. While they are in fact allowed to have their feelings, they could have said \"hey, I feel kinda uncomfortable getting such personal gifts from someone I don't know that well. Please don't do that next time.\". Instead they started insulting OP, calling her creepy, a stalker and even saying how it's no wonder her family didn't want her. That's an absolutely disgusting thing to say. The family definitely has multiple assholes.", "I have been working on trauma in therapy. But I do have lots. Being on my own since I was 16 and having a lot of firsts with my fiance (first gift exchange, first time celebrating Christmas, etc) means I sometimes feel like I am a little lost and I always want to try my best now that I do these things, especially here. But sometimes I struggle with the fact I will never have that with my parents or sister and we're working on making me healthier with coping.", "It's possible. I admit I take more notice of these things because I always want to have a good relationship and to show I care. One of the things I was so excited about was becoming part of a loving family. That's something I never had but especially wanted for my child.", "I had met them a few times before. Had spoken to them all a bit more though but yes, this stuff was mentioned when I was talking to them in person. Editing for one thing. I knew his sister was a huge reader but got confirmation from Noah on the books, also checked with him on making sure they actually liked the stuff or with the signed thing for his brother, that it was what it was supposed to be.", "OP should have a deep conversation with her fiance about this situation. \n\nThe family's behavior is so mind-boggingly atrocious that I think something deeper is probably happening -- they're upset that their son is marrying young, or about to become a father in lieu of travelling or going to grad school or whatever, or that they wanted lots of in-laws themselves. Regardless, the couple needs to figure out what is really going on here, and OP needs to figure out whether her fiance is willing to stand up for his spouse to his family over the long term.\n\nUnless they're a \\*really\\* convincing explanation for their behavior (along the lines of \"we were all brainwashed by aliens that morning\"), I think they need to plan to live somewhere other than the fiance's hometown.", "YOU didn\u2019t cause problems- they did.", "Don\u2019t put this on your shoulders, and stop giving energy to people who don\u2019t deserve it. You sound like a sweet person, support your fianc\u00e9 like he supports you and concentrate on the happy.", "You did not cause the problem.  This is 100% on them.  I would be over the moon to have such a kind, generous, and thoughtful DIL as you.", "Just because they\u2019ve been close that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have issues or that they\u2019re not toxic people. Absolutely NTA. You did nothing wrong.", "Well you sound lovely , I think maybe they are just not used to such thoughtful gifts from someone before, hopefully they will open up to you sooner rather than later\u2026 just keep killing them with kindness haha", "Please try to understand that you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Your gifts were extremely kind and thoughtful. His family is acting horribly, not only being rude but also being bullies. They\u2019re 100% in the wrong here. Most people would be touched and grateful that you\u2019re perceptive enough and care enough to find things they\u2019d truly enjoy.", "Could they of responded that way because they got you something small, that took no extra thought. And you did the opposite making them feel inadequate or that they now owe you.", "So all these gifts are things you made/bought based on actual conversations you had with each individual? And you know these folks pretty well on a personal basis? It just seems like a really strong reaction from the entire family. You are NTA, definitely. I\u2019m just not sure the rest of the family is either. Except the sister. She totally is.", "Hmm.  Well, if that's the tradition then NTA.  They sound odd to say the least.", "Thanks for the correction. \n\nBut the rest still stands.  You are someone who is just now being integrated into the family, they don't know you as your fiance does. Those gifts would be appropriate next Christmas, after you're married and will have spent much more time getting to know one another.", "Look at all the old AITA posts where people give their poor cousins new Xboxes and other fancy things for Christmas.", "That's not what happened here", "Thank you for pointing that out. I missed the part they attacked her after, and that they had they had spoken to Noah first. \n\nI re-read the post and they attacked her after speaking to Noah / which definitely makes them the AH for being rude to OP. They easily could have left their discomfort with Noah and cleared the air in the future when it wasn\u2019t so fresh, if it was necessary.", "Exactly. They\u2019re entitled to their feelings but should have been gracious regardless and certainly shouldn\u2019t have insulted and bullied OP. They sound like vile people.\n\nEdit bc autocorrect is ridiculous", "Noah is right to demand they apologize to you. Don\u2019t be so eager to please that you let them disrespect you like that. It\u2019s okay for them not to like your gifts, but they were out of line to bring your family/childhood into it.", "I get it, I\u2019m exactly the same. Me and my boyfriend had our baby in May and even tho I\u2019m still on awkward terms with his parents I made a memory box with the hat the baby came home In and the first picture of all of them, and I remembered his sister likes lazy days so I bought stuff for a lazy day. They however were thankful like your fianc\u00e9s family should be thankful", "Idk I still feel it a bit creepy, if it's just personalized gifts for the parents, sure, but with the others, especially the memorabilia, it'll make me uncomfortable personally. You might feel you're close to them but they could be just being polite, but not close enough yet to you.\n\n\nPs: i often remember random stuffs people told me, but I try not to bring those up with people I'm not close with cos it feels creepy and stalkerish for me if I'm in their place, like why is this person I'm not close to remember what i mentioned offhandedly long time ago\n\n\nETA: but what the sister said is totally uncalled for, that was seriously rude", "Thank you. I'll always support him. He's amazing, like you said, and I am so glad I found him.", "Thank you for saying that to me.", "Yes, it was based on conversations I was involved in and questions I had asked myself (like when Noah and I ask how shopping for the kids was going). Or when Noah's mom had mentioned the jewelry box and we talked about how neither of us ever had something like that. I do take note more. But I also never did Christmas outside of me and Noah so I can understand that it was too much for them.", "I understand. I didn't think it would be too much but I can accept that it was.", "And what is wrong with that exactly?", "How do you know? How do you think OP knew what was on the wish list & what the parents were buying already if it wasn\u2019t shared with her? And why would it be shared with her if they\u2019d be insulted when she bought something from it?", "I understand that. I have never done Christmas with anyone but Noah before and wanted to make sure they enjoyed what I gave them and knew that I appreciated them. But it made them uncomfortable and that was never my intention at all. It did though and I want to learn from this.", "Most people would be thrilled with those gifts.  It wasn\u2019t too much.  Going forward they would get nothing from me.", "Your making a point to upstage everyone else.", "That's a cynical and unreasonable way to look at it. Gift giving isn't a competition. If someone gives out a great gift, it's a good thing for the person who has received the gift and that's all that matters.\n\nSomeone else's ego or vanity should not stop someone who wants to give a good gift from giving a good gift.", "NTA at all. What you did is unimaginably kind and as someone with lots of siblings, it means the world to me when their spouses get me something that shows they have been paying attention to me and recognize me as a human being and not just \u201csister of my bf/fianc\u00e9/husband\u201d\n\nYou deserve much better and I am shocked that this was their response. Have you only met them once or something? Did you need to \u201cstalk them\u201d online to figure out what to get them, or did you just pay attention? It sounds like the latter, but the only way I could see having their reaction is if you really had no normal way of knowing what to get. Even then I\u2019d just assume your fianc\u00e9 helped, not that you were a creepy stalker.", "NTA I don't understand how these gifts are too personal if you have heard them talk about them/discussed it with you.\nSeems they are also being too personal to you.", "STOP. APOLOGISING.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, they are awful mean people, and it saddens me that you can't even see it, you're so used to doormatting yourself in the face of rude and abusive behaviour.\n\nThe appropriate reaction is \"what the fuck is wrong with these people, they're nuts and rude and they can stay the hell away from me with their toxic behaviour\", not \"omg I'm so sorry I'll do whatever it takes for you to like me\".\n\nTime to dust up your shiny spine and say NO to being abused.", "Why on earth is it weird that you decided on gifts they would like, presumably in discussion with their *son/brother*? Are they assuming that you came up with all of this without his input and agreement, given that he knows them *very well*?\n\nI call shenanigans - this reeks of people looking for problems. \n\nStop apologising to them, you did nothing wrong. This is your fiance's issue to deal with and he needs to handle them and not permit any excuses. Their behaviour is unconscionable and obviously designed to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible.\n\nNTA. In the future, should they ever reach a point where you can stomach giving any of them a gift again (I probably wouldn't), I recommend presents from the two of you as a couple.", "Yeah, I fucking hate it when people put in the effort to get me a thoughtful gift /s\n\nNTA and WTF", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNoah's family sound like literal ghouls to the point where I'm begging this to be fake.", "NTA, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to deduce that Noah gave you the information that enabled your thoughtfulness. It's not like you got people sex toys or a scrapbook of photos of them sleeping taken through the window, which is what their reaction kinda implied.\n\nSounds to me like these people have serious  issues, and you're just being scapegoated. I see you in comments saying you caused a family rift: no the hell you did not. They did that all by themselves. You'd be within your rights to never want to see these people again.", "NTA\n\nThis actually happened to me with my ex. The answer ended up being that they were tight knit and had hang ups about letting someone new in.\n\nI don\u2019t know what your situation is but I can tell you there is no way way this is actually about the gifts.", "IF you had bought generic gitfts,they very likely would have been complaining about that too. \"She didn't put any thought into gifts\" *insert massive eye roll here*\n   Your future IL's are the astronomical AH's!\nNTA..NTA..NTA....", "NTA - They probably didn't put the effort in for your gifts, felt like crap and decided to make you the bad guy about it. \nGet them a generic gift next time - 3 for 2 deals even better !!", "I think those are lovely and thoughtful gifts.  I would never have thought any of those things were too personal, not at all.\n\nNTA", "NTA What you did was extremely thoughtful and normal people would be appreciative. I would seriously question marrying into a family like that.", "WTF is wrong with them??? Those are all gifts appropriate to what they like and that's how they react?? Marry Noah and never buy them anything again, he can deal with them.  What AHs!\n\nNTA OP, I would love to have a SIL like you!", "NTA what did they want gift cards to Walmart?", "nta \ni would happily welcome you into my family \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like they already made up their minds about disliking you.\n\nDoes Noah have an ex that they were all fond of?", "NTA, you sound like a wonderful person. I had a bad life as a kid, I 100% understand your motivation for wanting to give wonderful personal gifts that you were never given yourself. They simply don\u2019t understand, that wasn\u2019t their reality.

There is something wrong with these people.", "NTA \n\nYou are engaged to Noah. That makes you part of the family whether they like it or not. I think your gifts were extremely thoughtful and show you as a lovely person. Noah is 100% correct that his parents and siblings owe you an apology. \n\nI think both of you should consider cutting contact with those ungrateful AH.

I WISH more people were thoughtful like this.", "No way are you TA and you don\u2019t owe them another apology nor should you have apologized in the first place. You\u2019re fives were very thoughtful and you were trying to be a part of a family you\u2019re about to marry into! I\u2019m so surprised how they all reacted! They clearly mentioned all these things to you, even if just in the phone. I\u2019m glad Noah stood up for you! If the subject comes up again the apology I would offer is for being a good listen and trying to do something extremely thoughtful for your editors in laws. Discuss their reaction with Noah and how this is going to impact living closing to them, your upcoming wedding, a baby, all of it.

They are unhinged.", "I would cry if a future daughter-in-law did this for me especially if she didn\u2019t know me very well!! NTA at all!!!

You were observant when talking to them, it\u2019s not like you went digging through their trash to find info on them. You put in time and effort and it sounds like you got everyone lovely, thoughtful gifts. They\u2019re not overly personal, it sounds like you just made an effort to get to know them when you interacted with them. I\u2019m glad your fiance stood up for you.

His family is nuts. Good thing he escaped the madness!", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry this happened! They sound like they are acting very strangely. I offhand mentioned that I liked my BF\u2019s sisters\u2019 fleece animal print shorts the second time we met. I completely forgot about them until they showed up in the mail one day! I thought it was so sweet that she remembered and sent me a pair! Like I was being accepted by her. You have nothing to feel badly about doing here and I\u2019m glad Noah is being so supportive. Just so strange", "Those gifts sound fantastic!  If I were rich, I would literally want to hire you to help think of gifts for my own family, because I never know what to get people.  \n\nYou're truly gifted at gifting.\n\nNTA.

You sound amazing! Next time, cash or gift cards for all of them and they can go fish themselves.", "NTA. Your gifts were thoughtful. Noah's family sounds horrible. I'm glad he's supporting you.", "You sound amazing. I think every gift I received (and gifted myself!) was bought on Amazon this year!", "Holy shit NTA. Your gifts were thoughtful and incredible and they'd be lucky to have you in the family, shame they're being massive jerks.", "NTA in any way, shape or form.  Who are these people????  The kind effort and thought you put into gift giving would have been met with appreciation and gratitude under normal circumstances, but to be called a stalker for it?  That's just crazy.  I'm worried for you marrying into a family that takes the \"fun\" out of dysfunctional. Thankfully, your fiance has your back!", "You sound like such a beautiful and thoughtful soul. Some people are very triggered by that and it is absolutely not your fault. I just want to give you the biggest hug. I'm so glad that Noah has your back on this but there is definitely something deeper going on here.", "You sound like the kindest human, anyone would be so lucky to have such a sweet and thoughtful addition to the family. They need to apologize to you, I cannot fathom why they would be upset! You are NTA, not at all!! You sound like a wonderful human, I hope they realize their mistake and thank you for your kind gifts.", "NTA, and I can see from your comments how easy it is for them to make you doubt yourself, but you are an incredibly kind and thoughtful person. His family on the other hand are not. They used your traumas to hurt you deliberately. \n\nIn my opinion if they don't appreciate this level of thoughtfulness now when you are engaged to their son/brother and pregnant with his child, then don't give it to them again. They have blown it, except maybe the kids. Noah, your child and maybe the other kids can benefit from the amazingly thoughtful gifts you get and the rest can suffer the consequences of their actions. \n\nBut please don't let their reaction and some of the other comments make you think you did anything wrong or creepy. You didn't stalk them. You talked to them, just because they don't care to actually take note it doesn't mean everyone should be like that.", "NTA.  Noah\u2019s family reacted very poorly, and his sister is massively cruel to rub your family history in your face.  I am glad Noah is sticking up for you.  Please stop apologizing because you did nothing wrong.  \n\nFrom now on out, just let Noah buy all the gifts for his family from both of you.  If you buy any gifts get items like candles, slippers, scarves, notecards, chocolates, car wash coupons, fancy beverages, and other benign items.  They have made their preferences clear, and it will be so much easier for you to do as they wish.\n\nI am confident that you will meet people in your new home town and make friends.  Take it slowly, and be selective.  Your keen observation skills will help you identify other people who are as kind and generous as you are.  Sharing your talents with those who appreciate them is better than throwing them away on those who don\u2019t care.  \n\nYou sound like an amazing young woman and Noah is lucky to have met you.  Congratulations on your upcoming wedding and pregnancy.", "NTA at all! I truly can\u2019t understand why they would be upset.

I would be NC but that's just me. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding and baby!", "NTA\n\nWtf? So you were immensely thoughtful and they responded by making horrible comments about your difficult childhood? Did it occur to them that your fianc\u00e9e knows them, and would have helped you get gifts they loved??", "NTA what an absolutely odd response by his family.", "NTA, but let me try to understand. You gave them gifts they wanted/needed and they got angry because they were too personal? From your title I thought that maybe you gave them like underwear or something very inappropriate. \n\nThought out gifts are nice, I hate receiving junk I have no use for! Imagine complaining for liking the gift you received! \n\nPlease don\u2019t be a doormat to these people, they sound terrible. Your fianc\u00e9 is right they are the ones that need to apologize.", "This sounds bizarre and made up.", "Wowza. What incredibly dramatic people.

You went to great efforts to give them gifts based in things that they said to you and they threw it back in your face?! If only everyone was as thoughtful as you.

You may wish to stay no contact after this, I don't know how you come back from people treating you so badly.", "NTA but his family has been and I\u2019m so sorry. I also got engaged to my husband quite fast. Sometimes when you know you know. But his family has always made me feel so welcome. \n\nThe fact they called you a stalker to your face shows they have no respect for your husband or the relationship they have or the one he has for you. If I was him I\u2019d be absolutely fuming that they treated you that way. You have absolutely nothing to be sorry for. You did something so thoughtful and they don\u2019t deserve your thoughtfulness or kindness unfortunately. Could you have come on a bit strong - maybe but there was much kinder ways for them to give you guys feedback on it and work forward from there.

Have you ever watched Friends and Phoebe is getting serious with Mike and she has to meet his parents for the first time and they talk down on her because she had lived on the streets/was beneath him..it just reeks of that....anyways, I don't think its about the gifts and honestly it doesn't matter how thoughtful you are- they are being jerks and don't let your fiance or them gaslight you into thinking they are not doing it.", "NTA!

I\u2019m assuming you got most of the info for the gifts by asking questions of your fianc\u00e9 or through SM. The family  would likely have preferred that you learn about them organically, over time, and directly from themselves.\n\nThis kind of *instant intimacy* raises a red flag for a lot of people. They associate it with first dates who talk about marriage, scary movies, and - as they explicitly mentioned - stalkers.\n\nNone of that is the case.

I don\u2019t know if I would ever be able to be near that family again after they were so needlessly cruel. I also have a feeling their family may not be as perfect as you think, they may just put on appearances and in comparison to your childhood it might seem better so it\u2019s easy to miss. Please don\u2019t feel like you did a bad thing, many people would love to receive gifts like this and I would probably cry if someone cared enough to make me a gift like that, or if they remembered a specific thing I want months later and get it for me.

If they were uncomfortable, they should say so; accusing you of stalking and throwing your family history back at you is just cruel.", "NTA. Wtf did I just read. I would have been stoked to get something that thoughtful, his family are weird", "NTA. I've never gotten such thoughtful gifts even from close family. What an amazing personality you have.  Don't let those sours mess your life. Just because they're close does not mean they are good people- remember that!", "NTA. This is a bizarre response to a sweet, thoughtful gift. I think your fiance should have a conversation with them about what may have actually made them want to treat you so poorly, because I seriously doubt it was the presents", "INFO: What kind of gifts they got for each other?\nThe only explanation I can think of is, that they gifted unpersonal and not very thoughtful stuff and now feel bad in comparison\n\n(Would be no excuse though, your gifts sound wonderdul an loving)", "NTA. I'm curious though, how did you know what gifts to buy? That info will help clarify what the hell is going on.", "NTA\n\nTheir reactions are weird and off-putting. I have pretty much stopped gift giving to anyone other than my children and my nieces and nephews. But I'm like you, I pay attention to conversations and things people like when I buy gifts. Or I buy something that I think suits them or reminds me of them. I don't give for the sake of giving. I give because I put thought into that gift for that person. If they don't like that, then they get nothing.", "NTA. You spent time to find things they would like and honestly, their reaction is weird and doesn't make any sense.", "NTA, wow he has a very ungrateful family. You tried very hard and his family is TA here. Gifts should be received with grace and appreciated especially when someone worked so hard to get them.", "NTA and Noah was right, they do owe you an apology", "NTA.

Your gifts sounded so thoughtful, and I would feel blessed if you married into my family.

You deserve better than this.", "I cannot begin to imagine what caused the in-laws to react so cruelly to such thoughtful and meaningful gifts. OP, you have done NOTHING wrong. In fact, you went above and beyond. I wish you were part of my family! NTA in any way, shape, or form.

It's not like you are \"this seasons girlfriend\" you are about to be married and have a baby with their son!\nEdit: also I think they are embarrassed because you were thoughtful and paid attention to them, while they were so shitty that they couldn't think of getting you anything personalized -hence gift cards - because they clearly have never really bother to listen to you or ask you questions to really know you. I'm really happy that your fiance is standing by you, that's really refreshing to read!", "If you bring gifts to a family and they are all collectively freaked out. My gut reaction would be to look at the gift giver and not at the family. They still see OP as a stranger and are in the getting to know you phase. With OP giving them these very personal gifts to people she has just met; it does seem very suspect and downright creepy. I totally understand the reaction. \n\nThese are not thoughtful gifts. This is something else and is genuinely concerning. If there are red flags here it is for the OP, not the family.", "NTA. No sane or rational person would be upset about someone, who\u2019s going to be joining their family soon, taking the time to buy/make them thoughtful gifts for Christmas. You did absolutely NOTHING wrong and your fianc\u00e9 is right, every single one of them owes you an apology.\n\nBut also, have you ever gone to or thought about therapy? I think you may still be dealing with the trauma you went through as a child. Your natural first response to people being so unimaginably callous and cruel towards shouldn\u2019t be to apologize.", "Wow... Just wow... OP, you are so NTA. As others have said, this is a huge red flag that needs to be discussed in depth with your husband to be. I also recommend that you both consider moving away from the home town. This kind of behavior is very creepy and downright abusive.", "NTA. I had no idea where this was going because those all sound like lovely and thoughtful gifts. I\u2026would not want to become part of this family.", "NTA. You did a wonderful thing, putting so much thought and consideration into these people, and they shat on it. That's not about you, it's about them.\n\nI'd love someone as kind and thoughtful as you in my family. I have a single BiL, just sayin'...\n(Kidding. Your guy stood up to his awful family for you. He's a keeper.)", "OP you are anything but the A H you are an ANGEL.  \n\nAs someone whose love language is gifts, if someone got me something so personalized, I would cry. You were so kind and loving, this family does not deserve you. I am so happy that your fianc\u00e9 has stood up for you. \n\nHe needs to continue to take charge of this and figure out what is their problem. To say his family\u2019s response was odd is the understatement of 2022. If he\u2019s the only son, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some weird jealous, controlling emotional incest going on that he\u2019s no longer only their special boy. \n\nPlease establish boundaries. They owe you a heartfelt apology as well as a gift as thoughtful as you got them. I would also consider for the sake of having a peaceful wedding, have your husband uninvite them if they will not apologize. Unfortunately you need to protect your new family, especially your baby. If they can be so cruel to you, imagine how much worse they can be to your child. Please please please have your husband set healthy boundaries and expectations for your new growing family and for your own mental peace. You deserved so much better.", "NTA. \nAlso come from a tense home situation as a kid and am marrying into a very close-knit nuclear family. I didn\u2019t meet my in laws for about a year and a bit.

I'd be delighted to have such thoughtful gifts. It's always hard thinking of what to get in laws and I think you hit the nail on the head for useful, thoughtful gifts. Gifts that are too personal made me think you'd raided their underwear drawer to get sizes and preferences, not a damn photo frame for crying out loud.\n\nAnyway, please don't let this change how you are.

Please don't let these people bring you down.\n\nNTA", "NTA a thousand times\n\n\nthis is insane, i feel so sorry that they made you feel thus way. and I don't understand how you're a 'stranger' if you're marrying their son in a month??? and carrying his baby??? wtf... they personally haven't seen you much but you mean a lot to Noah and that should be enough for them to consider you family and not a fucking stranger. what a bunch of ungrateful jerks. I'm so sorry", "NTA. You could use some therapy (please don\u2019t take offense). You\u2019ve dealt with a lot of things growing up being 16 and homeless is something that alters a person. The fact that you tried so hard and were so thoughtful only to get such a cruel response is horrible. I would like you to get therapy so you can understand what they did was wrong you did NOT deserve that. I\u2019m so glad you found someone to stand up for you!! They sound so awful. No they\u2019re so cruel to call you a stalker to your face and say that\u2019s why nobody wants you. Babe there\u2019s no coming back after that. I wouldn\u2019t even want to be around them! Find some awesome people in your community. Family is not only blood or married!", "NTA\n\nOne of my ex\u2019s sisters got me one of the most thoughtful gifts I have ever gotten. \n\nI don\u2019t remember talking about my mental health struggles with her, maybe I did. Or maybe my ex mentioned something. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m a very private person about my feelings and I have a hard time opening up to people. I say this because it\u2019s important to understand that she and I did not have any kind of relationship. Just friendly with each other. I also had only known my ex for exactly one month by the time we spent Christmas with his family. \n\nShe got me a handmade necklace with a stone that symbolizes self love and is supposed to promote healing. She\u2019s into that kind of stuff and I\u2019m curious about it. I love jewelry with \u201chidden\u201d significant meaning. I have extremely personal tattoos that you would have no idea what they mean because they\u2019re not obvious, they\u2019re \u201chidden\u201d sort of. \n\nI opened that present and read the little description about what the stone symbolizes. I looked at her with tears in my eyes, got up, and I hugged her. Because I felt seen, accepted, and cared for. \n\nTHAT is the reaction you should have gotten. And I get that you have your own abandonment trauma. Therapy is really helpful for that. But you need to learn that other people\u2019s reactions to you are NOT a reflection of you or your worth as a human being. Otherwise you\u2019re going to keep running into this cycle of people treating you like garbage, you thinking it\u2019s your fault when it\u2019s not, trying to people please instead of standing up for yourself, and people continuing to treat you like garbage. You deserve better than that.", "Definitely NTA. You got them all very thoughtful gifts.  And frankly, none of them were overly personal.  I was almost expecting you to say you got his mom lingerie or something. LOL.   The way they overreacted is a red flag for me. Even going so far as to call you a stalker to your face? From now on I'd get them generic gift cards if anything. But I would definitely talk to your fiance about getting to the REAL reason they are so hostile towards you.", "NTA, they are. It sounds like you really put in the effort and thought to get them gifts they would love, but instead they reacted so weirdly. I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re a stalker if you\u2019re getting them things they told you they wanted/hinted at? You sound like an awesome SIL/DIL and they should consider themselves lucky to have you.", "I could understand they felt weird about her knowing so much about them without having met her face to face yet but the comment about ops family was uncalled for.

You're not a stranger - you're marrying one of their family members! Why in the world would they behave this way? I'm baffled and hurt for you. Your fiance is a winner for having your back in this; keep Noah-Lu-Who, but hold his family of grinches at 39.5' pole distance. That's some nasty-wasty skunk behavior. NTA, OP.", "I don't think this is about the presents. I think it's about your background.  They didn't want to accept you because of your previous homelife and homelessness.  \n\nYour thoughtful presents left them speechless. But the next day, when they were ready for the attack, they went straight  for your history. Through no fault of your own, you have a bad history in their eyes.\n\n You are not what they wanted for a DIL or SIL. Definitely distance yourself from them and your baby also when it comes. No apology to you, no access to baby", "I would probably cry if any of those gifts were for me or my kids. I love giving specific gifts. Anyone can walk in to a store and purchase a gift card. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, gift cards are amazing for certain things. I wanted a teal stand mixer. I got a gift card for the amount it costed. My mom wrapped an attachment she bought separately with the gift card and told me \u201cthey didn\u2019t have the one you wanted so here\u2019s a gift card to pay for it, you can wait for the teal to be restocked or buy a different color\u201d \n\nAnyone who listens and takes notes to buy/make a heartfelt gift is definitely someone I want to be in my circle.", "Info: Since they were so offended- did they give the gifts back?! Yea, I bet not.  OP NTA!!\nGifts were amazing!", "Nta. Fuck that, how disrespectful are they! And the same for your fiance!! From now on never buy them a gift ever. I couldn't imagine such a negative response from such a lovely thing.", "My heart is broken for OP! There was SO much thought that had gone into the gifts!! She just did for them what she would\u2019ve done for her own family\u2026and with her boyfriends support!!! They are ALL AHs!! Except OPs boyfriend!

You grew up in an unhappy home and that\u2019s clouding your ability to judge how crazy your in laws are being. \n\nYou\u2019re not a stranger. You\u2019re not a just a short term girlfriend. You\u2019re a fianc\u00e9e. Your husband\u2019s family is about to be your family. The gifts were completely reasonable and appropriate. They\u2019re just ingrates. \n\nStop apologizing. You did nothing wrong and and let your husband deal with his family from here on out .", "I think that op\u2019s gifts were so amazing and thoughtful that the family was intimidated and jealous. They had nothing to criticize so they had to find something and exaggerate it. Also if the fianc\u00e9e is the only boy and the youngest that could add to why the women reacted like this. In some families women are weird about their younger male siblings. They may not want to immediately accept op and plan to be nasty and haze/bully her.", "NTA\nI'm so sorry you felt the need to apologize to them for putting thought and effort into their gifts. They didn't deserve it. I was genuinely confused at how they thought those were too personal? Getting makeup for someone who likes makeup? What?\nThey don't deserve your niceness. It's nice that Noah defended you but you two should establish boundaries with his family in the future. To say you didn't deserve that is a massive understatement. \nYou sound like a gem. Give yourself a hug for me.", "NTA.\n\nI second most everything previously said, but also want to mention\u2026 \n\nOP, because of the abuse of your past, it seems to me you\u2019re exhibiting pretty significant people-pleasing behaviors. You did nothing wrong, and continually apologized to people who were treating you terribly, and days later have continued to feel guilt for doing nothing but being kind and thoughtful. \n\nIt might be worth it to spend some time talking with a therapist, so you can see your value, understand that you\u2019re worthy of love, and learn to place boundaries that don\u2019t allow you to be treated like a doormat. I promise you, that people pleasing is ultimately bad for your marriage, and learning to let go of it will improve your marriage and relationships going forward.", "NTA:\n\nYou outclassed all their own family's gifts for each other, and now they all feel shame for not putting in as much effort as you did for them, and so they are reacting badly and projecting their own inadequacy and shame in the gift giving department onto you in the form of scorn.\n\nKeep being awesome, and thoughtful!\n\nBut maybe don't get them shit next time.", "NTA.  \n\nIf I brought a partner to meet my family and the partner gave such thoughtful gifts, my family would tell me that I\u2019d better never break up with that partner.  Partner would immediately become part of the family, phone numbers exchanged, plans for future get together made.  My grandmother would immediately begin wedding planning, even if we weren\u2019t engaged.  She would offer to go ring shopping the next day even. Hell, they might even decide they liked the partner better than they liked me.  For all my family\u2019s faults and craziness, they would absolutely appreciate such care, time & effort.  \n\nTalk to your fianc\u00e9, it feels like something else is going on with this.", "NTA, these were incredibly kind and thoughtful gifts. I have no idea what is wrong with his family that they received a gift that says the giver put some thought into it and tried to get them something they'd like and they responded to that with anger and paranoia but that is **THEIR** problem. Something is very wrong on their end, not yours. You sound like a very sweet and thoughtful person and I'm glad Noah at least seems to appreciate it. Care about how HE feels, not his freakshow family.\n\n>That's what Noah's sister meant. I had told them honestly when they asked.\n\nNoah's sister is a fucking monster to take something that deeply personal and use it as a weapon to hurt someone as payback for *getting her a thoughtful Christmas present*. I have no idea what is wrong with these people but whatever it is it's A) significant, and B) not your fault at all.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, and you have no reason to feel guilty or apologetic. You went above and beyond to be thoughtful and kind and were met with a frankly insane amount of unearned hostility from a pack of assholes. My advice would be to limit contact with them going forward and get zero gifts for them from now on regardless of the situation. Christmas, birthdays, whatever; get nothing.", "NTA.\n\nThis is speculation, but it sounds like:\n\n* they might be uncomfortable with how quickly their son/brother\u2019s life seems to be changing. It\u2019s not actually sudden, but due to the fact that the majority of your relationship happened at a distance, the marriage/child might feel sudden. It\u2019s not how they imagined.\n\n* you are not who they imagined he would be with. Not your fault at all, but some people get weirded out by people who are NC with family.\n\n* they got you super impersonal gifts. Which I don\u2019t judge because gifting can be hard even for people who you know. But you have a skill for it and your high effort gifts really contrast with their low effort gifts for you and could feel embarrassing.\n\n* okay, the sister with the book sleeve\u2026 that one required research, but I wouldn\u2019t call it stalking. It\u2019s pretty easy with the internet to find info on books. But I can see how it might be overwhelming to realize how much effort went into the research - but if she has a Goodreads or something similar it\u2019s easy to find her favorites, and a quick google search tells you some content details. Hardly stalking. They rest? Sounds like you just remember conversations that were had with you directly. That just means you are a thoughtful listener. Also, since you don\u2019t know them that well, you have no choice but to jump off the little things you do know.\n\nAnyway\u2026 they suck. The accusation that you were a stalked is ludicrous. Leave them alone and let your fianc\u00e9 make them feel bad for a while.\n\nThey may seem close, but close does not always equal healthy. If they are being this awful to you they might not be the picture perfect family you imagined. Something to discuss with your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA that\u2019s really sad that they did this. I would be grateful someone went to that much effort to find a personal gift. My family has always been open and welcoming of in-laws or soon to be in-laws and that\u2019s the way it should be if you make your fianc\u00e9 happy that\u2019s all it should be about. You\u2019re future in-laws don\u2019t sound normal to me.", "NTA!! you showed you truly pay attention to people and it seems to be a natural thing for you. I am glad Noah stood up for you, maybe he needs to tell them all he was he thought they would like the gifts. Also a something signed for your favorite sports team isn't extremely personal, neither is a Jewelry Box or clothes for a toy.", "Oh jeez.  Sending you big hugs\u2026you were observant and thoughtful.  Definitely NTA, they are.", "Your gifts were thoughtful and amazing. You have nothing to apologize for,  the family has some very strange ideas. \n\nI would avoid them unless you receive sincere apologies from all of them, particularly your future SIL who was not only ungrateful for the gift but was intentionally hurtful. \n\nDo not have anything else to do with these people. You and fianc\u00e9 are creating your own family and can add people to it who will love and support you.\n\nAs the wedding is in February consider downsizing the guest list and invite people you like and who like you. I predict if his family attends the wedding it will not go well and you will be made to feel responsible.  Plan an elopement that you will remember and leave this horrid family behind. \n\nIf your future husband insists on gifts for his parents and siblings in the future, I suggest you pick from one of the many generic dried fruit and nuts combos found online for less $20 and have it delivered. Do not spend any more time or money on this people, their opinion of you is formed and until hell freezes over, it is unlikely to change. \n\nOn the plus side, your future husband sounds great - standing up to his family in support of you.", "NTA and this family is a bunch of red flags.

If/when they complain tell them you wanted to be sure not to get too personal or buy anything over the top after last year's fiasco. I don't like many gifts I get on Christmas but I shut the fuck up and quietly return it, gift it away, or donate.

People talk about stuff they like and need in casual conversation all the time. And\u2026YOURE ENGAGED TO THEIR SON!!! He can easily tell you what they like. He can easily help you buy the gifts. He can be an easy resource on what they want for Christmas. Stop apologizing and go get your stuff back. It\u2019s so convenient you\u2019re a stalker but no one gave you your gifts back.

Are they used to just mindlessly giving each other random gift cards?", "Yeah, or something crazy expensive, like a PS5 for the 7yo or $3k designer bag for the mom or something (which would be fine in certain circles, but overstepping in others).\n\nI wonder if they were just projecting because they didn't give her anything or something like that?", "I was thinking underwear. My sister takes great amusement in buying goofy boxer shorts for any male that joins the family. (Not sex themed, or even naughty humour, more like country flag print if she travels somewhere or days of the week or multi coloured polka dots etc). \nOPs gifts sound more like what I would give, and I think they were really sweet and would have loved to receive any of them. OP is NTA", "I agree - they sound very thoughtful.  Certainly not intrusive or stalkerish. OP is 100% NTA.", "This were exactly my thoughts. It's not like she gifted them their favourite brand of tampons or something like that", "I think fianc\u00e9 should step up and explain that he had given info/ insights about each person to aid in the gift hunt, as to alleviate the \u201cstalking\u201d allegations. However, the family will probably come up with some new thing to gripe about- they want to be mad for some reason. I hope fianc\u00e9 continues to stand up for OP", "Gift cards", "I found it out in person. Not through social media. I don't even use much of it really except for Instagram. I always pay attention. Things also stick with me because I always want to make sure I pay attention to people and learn about those in my life.", "I thought the same thing! I was like omg did she get her MIL edible underwear? This is so bizarre", "I\u2019m leaning towards coal.", "You're generous, after this stunt I wouldn't get them anything.", "I think they maybe think stuff outside of gift cards is wrong for newer people in their lives.", "That\u2019s what I think too. How did they treat you before this?", "They didn't. Though they perhaps disposed of them after we left, I'm not sure.", "Considering the family went straight for the throat with their dig at her being homeless for awhile, my bet is that they are just stuck up assholes who think they are better than OP.", "Great idea! OP, you should open an etsy shop! I would throw all my money at you!", "Yeah, I think OP needs to understand that no matter what gifts she got fiance's family or if she didn't get them anything, she was always going to be criticized. They don't like her for some reason. This is 100% not about the gifts. NTA", "Was hoping someone would say this!!! OP please don\u2019t let this family dampen your beautiful soul! What you did was an incredibly kind thing with a lot of thought! Plus, you ran it all by Noah which is the correct etiquette with gift giving when you don\u2019t know someone to well! I\u2019m so glad Noah is on your side, his family and especially his sister were really cruel to you! I\u2019m so sorry they did this to you!", "Or nothing at all. And if they ask why she didn't get them gifts, she can say she didn't want to seem stalker-ish.\n\nNTA. I would've been ecstatic if I got a gift like that. And I love giving thoughful gifts too (although I'm also being mindful what I get now - or not- since some family member basically told me in the past to stop buying them gifts).", "I was gonna say don\u2019t get them anything, I like your idea better lol", "...as a hand jewellery holder.", "Then they will call her creepy for noticing they have feet.", "She should buy socks in wildly wrong sizes too, just to show how little she's paying attention to them.", "Socks can be a fine present, and are way more than this family deserves.", "Mismatched moth eaten socks.", "Right. I'd leave it up to Noah to get them gifts in the future.", "And spell their names wrong on the card- after all, painstakingly learning how to spell someone\u2019s name is awfully personal.", "Thrown at them.", "You didn\u2019t cause any problems. Their reaction was so bizarre I think you would have been criticized no matter what you did. They were looking for something. Why is anyone\u2019s guess. But you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and most other people would have appreciated your thoughtfulness.", "You are definitely not the one causing problems. \nIf I were you I would just take the gifts back and return them- but maybe I\u2019m just petty.\n\nYou put so much thought into the gifts, I honestly cannot believe that they reacted like that.\n\nYou know what? It seems like they are projecting.\nYou don\u2019t know each other for long, but you still managed to get them sth. they might like, because you are an attentive and CARING person.\n\nAnd may I ask what they got you? Sth small and casual every woman would probably like, so nothing personal or anything?\n\nThey are projecting cause they probably just feel bad that they were incapable of getting to know you and justify it with you being \u201ccreepy\u201d and a stalker.\n\nNo one, especially not the family you\u2019re marrying into should say something disrespectful like that about you.\nI would really reconsider their place and value in your and your future husbands life.", "The problem is something else, the gifts are an excuse to find fault with you.", "Then they weren\u2019t really that close.  It was a mirage for the public.  Not real.  Because this isnt even a thing.  You didn\u2019t do anything wrong at all.", "This relationship is not healthy. You are not the problem. This family is bizarre. If you had gifted my family like this, they would have cried and hugged you and kissed your little face. They would have talked about it for the rest of their lives. These people are hateful and awful.", "You did not cause problems. You did nothing wrong. I understand why you would feel that way, but this is not your fault. Please don\u2019t let them get under your skin. You sound like a very nice person and you didn\u2019t deserve the treatment they gave you.", "Their issue. Of they want to stay close to Noah, they had better accept you.", "As you and Noah are engaged, aren\u2019t gifts jointly from you both? Even if you bought things that were a little too personal (and you didn\u2019t, you were fantastic) the gifts were half from their son/brother and should therefore have been totally appreciated? His sister was so spiteful to you and I wouldn\u2019t bother speaking to her again, but that\u2019s just me. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou are a treasure. They don\u2019t deserve you.", "Sounds like you\u2019re trying to take the blame for something that isn\u2019t your fault. Their behaviour is the issue. Your gifts were maybe a little too thoughtful but not enough to drive a wedge in the family. That\u2019s on them.", "It's not you, it's them.", "It's not you, anyone would be overjoyed to have someone so thoughtful in their lives. They're miserable people you need to get away from, or they'll make you miserable as well. And please seek therapy for your family trauma and letting assholes walk all over you.", "YOU DID NOTHING WRONG. Please stop putting your self down you are worth more. You are very kind person to think of them and get thoughtful gifts they are the AH to not see that.\n\nAlso not in a bad way go to therapy to help you. Grow that backbone girl.\n\nOh also congrats on the soon baby, wedding and finding an amazing guy. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude0a", "you didn't cause any problems at all - they are being odd. Even if you were a little off with your gifts, normal people just keep their mouths shut and get on with it - not accuse someone of a crime because they gave them a thoughtful present at Christmas", "Just another voice to add to the chorus. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong, you haven\u2019t caused anything! \n\nThey are 100% in the wrong here, listen to Noah and let him defend and protect you \u2764\ufe0f", "OP, there is something wrong here. Your gifts were extremely thoughtful and generous. You used time to create personalized items to gift. The amount of effort shows the amount of love you have to share. \n\nOne question: WHAT DID THEY GIFT YOU? Generic, thoughtless, beebobs and doodads? They sound upset that you showed them up.\n\nI encourage you to remain thoughtful in your gifting to them. \u2026.. From now on, gift them toilet paper to clean up their crap. \n\nBest wishes for your best life, OP. You deserve so much better than this rude, selfish, ignorant, prejudicial family can provide.

I am glad Noah stood up for you, and I am sorry his family is pants-on-head bonkers for not appreciating you.", "Based your response, you really need therapy. You are not causing problems here.You need to stop blaming yourself for this.", "You did not cause the problem. Noah\u2019s family is very strange; most people I know would be amazed and thrilled that their soon-to-be-in-law was so attentive and generous. Something is very wrong with them. I\u2019m glad Noah has your back.", "They caused their own problems \n\nI bet they don\u2019t even remember saying any of those things to to, which is why the sister called you a stalker. But if my guess is true\u2014it\u2019s concerning and indicative of how they\u2019d se you. Not important. No I don\u2019t remember everything I to my family and friends, if you remember those conversations and they can\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s an issue. It means they\u2019re only having throw away conversations and that says something about how they see you. Are they supposed to heartfelt instantly\u2014no. But getting to know new members of the family is about getting personal T times", "You were thoughtful and did some research.  You paid attention to what was important to people.  You're a wonderful person. \n\nPeople post personal stuff online to strangers every day... you're engaged to a member of the family.  I'm sure even with out meeting them you heard a lot about them from Noah, phone conversations and what they post online.", "Personally I was imagining a huge bad dragon dildo as an overstepping gift.", "Yeah. Something isn't adding up here. Family's reaction is way overboard. The gifts aren't out of line in the least. There's gotta be something OP doesn't know about the family's feelings about her. Sorry OP, you're NTA. Not sure if Noah having a frank conversation with the family without you there might help get some answers, but I'm also not sure if you want to know the answer to the question of why they're acting like this.", "Nope, you\u2019re spot on. I had something eerily similar happen to me when I spent my first Christmas with my new bf\u2019s family. His mom was openly pissed I got them nice gifts, as they didn\u2019t get me anything (and I didn\u2019t expect them to). When I called them out on it after a few days of tension and passive aggressive commentary, she said it was \u201cweird and inappropriate\u201d when got them gifts and I told her I don\u2019t celebrate Christmas with my family because they were and are abusive towards me. And that I shouldn\u2019t have expected much warmth from her, as I\u2019m a stranger to their family. Oh, and that I reminded her of her narcissistic ex, who is my bf\u2019s father. \n\nMe being open about my trauma made the people around me with their own repressed trauma very uncomfortable. It calls them out of denial and into accountability. It wasn\u2019t intentional, but it happened. I feel for OP, but I am so glad her fianc\u00e9 has her back!", "Didn\u2019t even think of this- but you are totally right!", "Maybe they were embarrassed by their thoughtless gifts and had to make you look small. Still they are assholes. Noah and you should go NC until.they show you the proper respect and gratitude.", "Don\u2019t feel bad. They were being complete and utter jerks to you. If anything, they probably felt \u201cguilt\u201d about the generic gifts they gave you and wanted to make you the bad guy so they could feel better about themselves. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "You made them feel guilty OP. They put no thought into your gifts and when you put thought into theirs, they felt like assholes and so they blew up at you. This is on them not you. \n\nNTA.", "Seems like you made them feel guilty for not putting any effort into the gifts they got you. That or maybe they don\u2019t think the gifts were equal in monetary value to the cards they gave you, which is bullshit considering the time and effort you spent acquiring them. The reason they gave is a cover for something else.", "Your gifts were thoughtful and kind. Going forward, if you even deal with them, I would get this crappy impersonal gifts, like socks, soap, crap like that. I wouldn\u2019t waste a minute thinking of them.", "I bet they\u2019re just ashamed they put in minimal effort and are lashing out at you, because they can\u2019t handle their emotions well. It\u2019s not a reflection on you, they just can\u2019t handle having to look at themselves and realize they\u2019re not all that great. Don\u2019t apologize, move on and don\u2019t worry about putting so much effort in next time.", "Oh!  So maybe they felt guilty because they didn\u2019t bother to even try to get you anything worthwhile and just got gift cards (the gift that says \u201cI can\u2019t be arsed to think about you so take this and go do it yourself\u201d).  So them all being quiet after they opened their gifts was maybe them feeling bad about how much effort you made when they didn\u2019t even bother.  Once you and bf left they probably talked together and persuaded each other that you were weird rather than that they were AHs and they egged each other on to the point they were confrontational with you the next day.\n\nOf course, they could all just be batshit crazy, but then Noah would not have been surprised by their reaction.\n\nEither way you are NTA and please don\u2019t feel bad.  You did NOT make it uncomfortable for them, they were acting badly.", "Honestly, the best thing to do going forward is to just tell your fiance to pick out their gifts and then sign your name to the card with his. If they can't appreciate your attention to detail, they really are not worth anymore of your time or effort. You listened to them, ran your gift ideas by your fiance, who gave them the green light. Then they shat all over them. In your shoes I wouldn't do anything more than the bare minimum ever again. Let him deal with his horrible family going forward.", "And yet\u2014they don\u2019t feel AT ALL bad about how uncomfortable they made this for YOU.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty messed up, isn\u2019t it? It takes a certain sort of nasty person to be so cruel to a new member of the family. They ganged up on you. They bullied you and made you feel like an outsider. They made you feel ashamed and wrong for being thoughtful, sincere, and open hearted with them. That is atrociously monstrous behavior, and I hope you\u2019re able to see that. \n\nYou *objectively* did not do anything wrong. If they thought your gifts were weird, the only correct and polite and kind response would have been for them to say \u201cthank you!,\u201d and move on. There is never a reason to tell a GUEST IN YOUR HOME that you hated the gift they got you? That is very fucking strange and rude and mean behavior, and it is *alarming* that his whole family seems to share the trait of being *remarkably unkind.*\n\nI truly, truly hope your fianc\u00e9 is somehow the exception to his family\u2019s toxic behavior. If he\u2019s not able to get a clear explanation from them as to what is REALLY going on here, and an acknowledgment that they were cruel to you, and a sincere apology, I hope he *at least* never expects you to be in the same room with them again.\n\nThese trash humans do not deserve you. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve suffered so much cruelty in your life already. I think it\u2019s making it hard for you to see how blameless you are for how they acted, and how wrong it was for them to treat you poorly.", "NTA. And maybe this is really what's at cause (aside from being complete jerks) - they were embarrassed by the fact that you went out of your way to show you cared about your new family and they got you, future mother of their grandchild, neice/nephew a freaking lazy ass gift card. \n\nDarlin, you did absolutely nothing wrong and please don't allow them to tarnish how you give gifts. It's beautiful. I only wish that you were marrying into a loving family after your childhood experience. You deserve so much better than this garbage reaction.", "The whole family must give each other terribly generic & low-effort gifts for them to be so taken aback by OP's thoughtful gifts.", "OP, this is making me so sad! You do not deserve this and you did nothing wrong. Any normal person would honestly be touched by the thought and care you put into these gifts. Please don\u2019t beat yourself up", "You are going to have a loving family, with your husband and baby.", "You remind me a lot of my wife. Terrible abusive family, was excited when she was joining mine because she thought she'd finally have a loving family, then my mom and sister turned on her in a lot of petty, hateful ways just because they considered me the family ATM and having a wife meant less handouts for them. I burned that bridge to the goddamned ground and now we have our loving family that we've built with our children and friends rather than with the crappy ones we were both born with, and it's been wonderful. \n\nShe's also always careful to remember little things people say or do so she can surprise them with something thoughtful later, and it's one of the qualities I love about her. Her thoughtfulness was wasted on her family, and mine, but I sure as hell appreciate it and so do our kids. That's what matters.\n\nI don't know what the hell is wrong with Noah's family but he seems to have escaped that household as a good person, so ignore them and focus on the life you're building with him. Merry Christmas by the way!", "Wow! I hope she decides to keep her distance from the family, especially the sister that called her a stalker!", "I thought so. That makes you such a great person, and much better than his family deserves. FWIW in my family we\u2019d be so delighted we wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it for\u2026 ever probably. You did nothing wrong, and I really doubt this has anything to do with you. They are probably just upset about something else and using this as a means to take it out on you.", "Besides grief? lol \n\nSeriously, they're horrible.", "No. You just made them feel like assholes because you did the work in the relationship and they didn't and people don't like feeling like that so they turned it back on you.\n\nYou did nothing wrong OP.", "This isn't a rule anywhere. Thoughtful gifts are, for most people, a good thing. \n\nAlso, for most people, there's a rule against screaming abuse at a vulnerable pregnant woman. \n\nYou are not the problem here", "How old are you and Noah?", "i'm glad you are in therapy.  you are a wonderful person, noah sounds like a great man, and good partner.  dont let this hiccup sour you on his family.  be open to their apology.  your heart is in the right place.  have good luck in your life, and i hope you and noah are very happy.", "OP, thoughtful gifts from my long term partner or my family still make me uncomfortable sometimes because of my own stuff - but the gifts are still lovely. Ironically, others often feel discomfort when receiving my gifts, because they're not used to being heard, or being properly thought of. However, discomfort is not necessarily a bad thing. Often it gives us a prompt to explore where those feelings come from and learn more about ourselves. And it's on us to deal with those feelings maturely. They did not do that. \n\nThe only thing you may have 'done wrong' is if you feel the need to put so much thought and time in because you're worried about not being enough for them as you are, if you feel like you had to earn being accepted or prove your value this way. And even in that case - you're doing 'wrong' to yourself, not them.\n\nOP. You sound very kind and thoughtful. You're allowed to be kind and thoughtful without everything relating back to your trauma. However Noahs' family felt about it is on them to communicate respectfully and thoughtfully - they were utter assholes dealing with their own feelings badly.\n\nThis might not be relevant, but even though it may not feel like it, you don't need to spend any more of your life trying to fit in and keep everyone happy to be safe. You are not solely responsible for everything being OK.\n\nYou are your own person, who sounds kind and thoughtful and empathetic, and I'd like you to remember that just because you haven't done some things before, doesn't mean you're not doing it \"right\". I mean, I spent every year with my family doing Christmas and a lot of it was really shitty.", "I don't think they did. I bet they have them and are using them. \n\n  If I was truly offended by a gift, I wouldn't keep it.  I would give it back and say this isn't right. \n\nI think you have too good of a heart for these people.  \n\nYou wanted to make a good impression so you worked really hard for them. \n\nPeople don't know how to handle people that are empathetic and pay attention since a big chunk of the world doesn't. So they accuse people that do pay attention of being creepy. \n\nI know what they said hurts,  especially that cheap shot about your family. \n\nI unfortunately grew up in abuse and neglect and reading what she said to you made me so angry. \n\nYou sound like you have a lot of love to give.  They have proven they aren't the ones to give that love to.  I am sorry you had to deal with that. \n\nBut know this, no matter what your childhood is telling you, you didn't deserve that. Trying to do something really thoughtful is not wrong. \n\nGive yourself a hug and say I did my best and my heart was in the right place and that makes me ok!", "This. OP you are NTA.\n\nBut something else is going on here. Their (THEIR) behavior is seriously odd and, honestly, concerning. You were nice and thoughtful and they denigrated you and reacted in a bizarre manner.\n\nTalk to your fiance. This is literally not OK.", "If OP reads a single message from this thread, I hope it's this one. Poor woman was so amazingly generous and thoughtful, she did not deserve being shit on like that.", "I can understand being a bit uncomfortable that someone you never met before gave you a very personal gift, but this reaction is bizarre.\nHowever, I don't think there is much doubt about why they don't like her; the sister's comment about her birth family is telling. They think less of her or her background and don't want her marrying into the family.", "You need to consider moving somewhere else ASAP.  Before the baby is born.  Once the baby is born, the courts in your current location would have jurisdiction over where the baby resides, and could prevent you from moving away.  This could create issues in the future if his family becomes a problem for your relationship.  NTA.", "I agree with this - because who in the right mind would disgrace such thoughtful gifts and efforts as Stalking and Creep! \n\nSomething is wrong with the Family\u2019s behaviour and I completely agree with this comment. \n**NTA**", "Lucky for OP, fiance has already shown support for her which is a wonderful start for an uncomfortable but necessary discussion about how to move forward as a unified team!", "Then they will say that she is breathing creeply and just should stop breathing all together /s", "For sure. When OP said personal I was picturing underwear or something. Her gifts were thoughtful and delightful.", "I got gift cards from them.", "This", "Exactly, it sounds like gift giving is your love language! I would be extremely touched if someone I didn\u2019t know that well put in such effort. The fact that they all reacted that way is incredibly strange.", "No, they do gifts from individual people in the family. Not joint gifts from a couple. So Noah's siblings and their spouses each give a gift to members of the family, same for his parents.", "You\u2019ve really nailed the issues. Everything you\u2019ve mentioned here is likely a result of trauma/attachment issues from having a terrible family. So for these people to be so cruel and weird is doubly awful. \n\nThis is a billion percent on the thoughtless and ignorant family! Good for Noah, seeing through them and seeing YOU OP.", "You sound so much like Noah. Thank you for being so wonderful to your wife and for telling me this!", "I'm so petty, I'd send the gift cards back with a note saying \"No thanks, stalkers.\"", "I was about to add this same type of comment.  I can't help but wonder if their response was more of an embarrassment response because OP gave such thoughtful gifts while soon to be in laws gave gift cards?  In any case, their response was over the top, insulting and truly shocking.  OP didn't give stalker gifts, just thoughtful gifts.", "I'm 23 and he's 24.", "Agreed. This is seriously all kinds of weird. OP went out of her way to get really thoughtful gifts, and the way her fianc\u00e9's family reacted is pretty disturbing. Like, they're about to be married and have a child on the way; it's not like she's a complete stranger they just met last week! OP is definitely NTA, but I've literally never heard of anyone reacting to a gift in that way. I'm honestly baffled.", "Yes this! I love the time and energy that she put into the gifts, and I would've absolutely been thrilled to get a gift from OP!", "Where is it that courts can stop married couple from moving with their kid where they want to move? Grandparents rights don't extend that far.", "Same! Or like, health-related things. But no, OP was just thoughtful, the gift were personalised... maybe the family felt ashamed because they didn't put the same thought and attention to the presents they gifted each other?", "I was thinking underwear as well.", "Your gifts were AMAZING, OP. I would have been delighted to receive anything even a tenth as thoughtful and amazing from my SILs, because it would've showed they actually listened and cared about me.   \n\n\nI have no idea why his family is acting like this, but it truly doesn't sound like your fault at all. It's just strange.", "They are saying it because it\u2019s true.", "You sound like a wonderful gift-giver! I love when people remember little things and put effort into their gifts! You are absolutely NOT the problem here!", "it's true. You sound like a treasure. Hang in there and make sure you like his family before marrying.", "OP, your gifts were more thoughtful than the ones I got from my family who's known me for almost 50 years. You are NTA in any shape, way or form", "If you were my SIL and gave me any of those wonderful gifts, I would be over the moon and so proud to receive it. \n\nPlease be my SIL \ud83d\ude4f because if you take such care in gift giving, I bet you take even greater care in friendships.", "Yes, please let this be your takeaway from this discussion! Not only are you NTA, you appear to be an absolute gem.", "Just remember that supporting him doesn\u2019t have to mean taking abuse from them. You don\u2019t have to go out of your way for his family when they treat you like this and say such hurtful things. This shows a lot about their character, not you. You were loving and kind and in no way deserved the treatment you got. I know you didn\u2019t have a great family growing up, but I don\u2019t want you settling for a mediocre family like his. You deserve a loving family, even if it\u2019s one you and your fianc\u00e9 make yourselves.", "They are surely projecting their insecurities. They probably feel inadequate compared to your thoughtfulness and consideration.", "Yeah. That might be it. They probably felt ashamed with how little effort they put into your gift if they ALL gave you gift cards. They may have discussed and agreed to do the same thing. Then you went above and beyond. Instead of dealing with the shame (a powerful emotion), they tried to make you the bad guy! \n\nYou sound like an amazing gift giver and a thoughtful human being. You absolutely did nothing to apologize for. You should actually be outraged! I know its hard to be confident about family things when you were abandoned. But trust your gut! Also, this is the dumbest fight for their family to be having. \u201cI am angry your fianc\u00e9e  gave us too thoughtful of a gift!\u201d. Yikes. So dont you DARE feel any stress or worry.", "Your gifts sound very thoughtful. Unfortunately his family sounds like they don\u2019t deserve those kind of gifts. In the future focus that time and energy on Noah and your child and just get them generic gift cards \nNTA", "I think this is part of the answer as well, that you put in the effort to get them something they would like, and they got you something that was pretty generic (not that you wouldn't appreciate that either), but they sound insecure and maybe took it as you making them look bad.. either way that doesn't even come close to justifying how they treated you. They are such the assholes, not you. The world needs more people like you-not them. NTA", "Interesting. It could just be they feel weird/ashamed about their generic gifts to each other when you have swept in and nailed perfect gifts first time. They are still very much in the wrong, but that might be why they are behaving so bitter and mean.", "Yeah...not too young to marry. Not sure what his family 's issue is. Don't ever change. You sound delightful. You will be a great mom! And Noah sounds like a keeper too!", "I\u2019m curious how OP figured out what to get for each person. I wonder if she just paid close attention to their conversations and wrote down/remembered things they said they wanted, or if she like, scoured their social media for random, obscure details about them. \n\nEither way, OP is NTA and she has an open invitation to ditch these assholes and come join my family Christmas whenever the hell she wants. But I wonder if their reaction is coming from a place of feeling like she has information about them that they did not specifically disclose to her (but posted online, or was common family knowledge that Noah could have passed on, which is why there\u2019s absolutely no excuse for their unforgivable rudeness and cruelty.)", "It would be an issue if the couple later divorces.  Given the current attitude of his family, they already seem to be trying to drive a wedge between the couple.", "The issue is if he\u2019s more devoted to his family then to her and they convince him to take the baby, not the extended family somehow gaining custody", "For real. Son's girlfriend gives thoughtful gifts?
