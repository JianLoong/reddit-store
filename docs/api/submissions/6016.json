I met them in the summer after we moved to be near his family now that he's finished with college. We're getting married in February and we're expecting our first child together in May. Being someone who has no family and seeing how close his family was, I wanted to make sure I showed my appreciation for them with the gifts I gave so I tried to get something each person would love. One of his sisters loves to read and so I made a book sleeve for her with little details from all her favorite books. One of his nieces is on the spectrum and has wanted clothes for her stuffy, so I made some clothes for her to put on the stuffy. I bought his mom a jewelry box that she had admired a couple of times after she mentioned never having a real one. For his dad I bought him a frame for his office big enough to hold photos of his whole family on, since he always complained he couldn't find one big enough or nice enough, and had no more room for individual frames. I included photos Noah had provided me in it. I got his other sister her favorite makeup which she mentioned she couldn't afford to buy lately. Then I got his brother a signed piece of memorabilia from his favorite sports team. For the rest of the nieces and nephews, I bought wish list items the parents weren't getting.\n\nNoah thought they would love everything. He told me I didn't need to go to the effort I did (I spent weeks tracking everything down and searching for certain items) but he really thought they'd like them. But when Christmas Day happened I could tell something was off. I spent the whole time worrying that I had bought them stuff they didn't like anymore or something. They said nothing. But then the next day they asked Noah what the hell I was thinking and I was like some kind of stalker buying them such personal stuff when I'm an almost stranger to them. The next day we saw them again and I apologized for the gifts I gave them and told them I would be a lot more mindful in the future. I offered to make it up to them. One of his sister's called me a stalker to my face and told me it was no wonder my family didn't want me if I was so creepy to do stuff like that. Noah yelled at her. I apologized again and told them I didn't want to hurt anyone and I would learn from this. They told me I had overstepped. Noah said we were leaving and they owed me an apology. I feel so bad. Noah is supporting me and told me I did nothing wrong. But surely there wouldn't be so much offense if that were true. I need to ask AITA?\n\nAlso, not sure if this is relevant or not but I grew up in an unhappy home. My parents were unkind to me and my sister. She was much older and also hated me. I think maybe because of how our parents treated her. But I ended up with nobody who wanted me by the time I was 16 and I was homeless for a good period after that. That's what Noah's sister meant. I had told them honestly when they asked.\n\nETA: I wanted to clarify something that might sound strange. I had spoken to them on the phone before but we had not met in person until this year. With Covid and us living in a different city at the time I had not gotten the chance. But they were genuinely all close before this.", "created_utc": 1672415644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz3u09/aita_for_getting_my_fiances_family_gifts_that/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I believe I might have gone too far. They felt it was too personal and I did go out of my way to make them suited to the person. I might be way too new to do that kind of thing.

Your gifts sound very thoughtful and you ran them by Noah. Not sure what's going on with his family but in the future you can save a lot of time getting generic gifts.", "NTA. While tailored to their interests, none of those gifts seem particularly personal to me. They are obviously based on what your fianc\u00e9 told you they liked.", "This is really sad. You went above and beyond for the family of your fianc\u00e9, and you were met with distrust and mocking. NTA\n\nThat\u2019s hard to get over, glad your fianc\u00e9 is standing by you.

Getting gifts they actually mentioned and paying attention to things they said to buy gifts is thoughtful, not stalkery. What the heck is wrong with these people?  They'd rather get an impersonal gift they don't care about??", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t overstep. You actually did exactly what most families want new in-laws to do when it comes to gifts. His family is way out of line - from their reaction, accusations, comments, all of it - and I\u2019m glad he saw it even if you didn\u2019t. \n\nWork on finding your backbone. Sounds like with this family as in laws you\u2019re going to need it.", "Nta: these are sweet thoughtful gifts. They are toxic.  I see you want to blame yourself and I'm telling you right now that what you did was sweet, not creepy and their reaction was completely out of line. You are joining their family, which makes it even more out of line. Apparently, you're a stranger to them and they don't want you in their family then I guess rheyre not gonna have a close relationship with ther grandchild", "NTA- this is so incredible to me. You went out of your way to make Christmas special for them and to give them things they\u2019ve been wanting or needing for years. You worked along side your fianc\u00e9 to make sure you got them thoughtful gifts. \n\nIf they think so much consideration is an issue\u2026 they must have a pretty miserable relationship with one another. Guess they\u2019ve gotten used to generic scarfs, gift cards, and chocolate", "NTA You actually \"listened\" to them and made mental notes along the way... even if you had never met them. Your gifts were very thoughtful. I'm glad your fianc\u00e9 is so supportive of you and stands up for you. He sounds like an outstanding guy. Your in-laws on the other hand, total butt wipes.

My SIL went way overboard our first Christmas together. She got me way too many presents and spent way more money on me than I did on her. I just felt a little awkward that I didn\u2019t match what she did, but I can\u2019t imagine saying something like that. I recognized she was just trying to make a good impression.", "NTA... Their reaction is very strange. It's great that he supported you. I'm wondering if it's about something else though. Ask Noah what it's all really about.", "NTA.

Maybe if they knew they would not have been so rude, disrespectful, etc\u2026 I mean you are marrying their son so kinda weird for their reaction to be what it was.", "NTA.  I find your fiance's family reaction very odd.  It sounds like you are very observant, a good listener, and wanted to do something nice for them.  The sister also sounds very nasty - what a cruel thing to say.  I'm glad Noah is supporting you.", "NTA. You are amazing, and are an amazing gift giver. I don\u2019t understand why your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family feels threatened by you\u2026 and why they are so ungracious in how they received the gifts.

This is their problem, not yours.", "NTA it\u2019s normal to listen to what people want and get it  for them.

What an odd reaction.  You are not a \"stranger\", you are marrying their son (brother) and will be the nother of their grandchild.  Im assuming they were just overwhelmed and maybe embarrassed if their gifts to you were not so thoughtful.  But glad your husband supported you.", "NTA I\u2019d be thrilled if my new SIL got me personal gifts like that. It means they actively listened during our conversations or to my daughter.

You sound really great and they should have been more friendly and empathic.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine being upset about someone trying to give a thoughtful gift to me. You put in effort but they weren\u2019t overly personal. I honestly cannot figure out why they were so bothered. Good for Noah for sticking up for you.", "NTA they were looking for a reason to push you away- thoughtful gifts is just what they chose. You did nothing wrong, Noah is right.", "NTA.  If someone took the time to track down something that months earlier I mentioned I liked I would be surprised as people don\u2019t tend to pay that much attention.  However, I would not be angry, in fact I would be very touched by their thoughtfulness.\n\nThey overreacted, were rude and refused your apology (which you did **not** owe them BTW).  What blows my mind is they yelled at and belittled a pregnant woman \u2026 who is pregnant with their grandchild and niece/nephew.  \n\nGosh, I don\u2019t know where you go from here.  OP I don\u2019t think his family is as wonderful as you think they are.  I think going LC for awhile is in everyone\u2019s best interest.", "NTA my MIL buys me pyjamas 3 sizes too small and crap from the dollar store I won\u2019t use.

It\u2019s not like you are a door to door salesman or something.", "NTA\n\nThere gifts are not remotely \"stalker\" territory. (When I saw the headline, I thought we were in for a tale of woe involving gifted sex toys!) These are sweet, appropriate, personalised gifts to the recipient. And you're not a stranger to them. They're going to be your in-laws.\n\nKudos also to your finace for supporting you. As I said, they're going to be your in-laws. I'm afraid they may have shown their true nature to you. Even if they disliked the gifts, reacting this way to a gift is extremely rude. You may want to have a candid conversation with your finace about how to handle them going forward.\n\nFinally, stop apologizing for the gifts. Apologies are for when you have wronged someone. You did nothing wrong. They should be apologizing to you.", "NTA. It sounds like to me that they were trying to find an excuse to hate you. It might be best not to buy or make anything for them in the future. Save yourself the headache and heartbreak.", "Tell Noah's entire family to give the gifts back then! You went above and beyond for his family,  for them in return to call you a stalker! Hell nah I want all my gifts back! Did they gift her anything?", "NTA, like this is some weird shit.

You are not the asshole, you are wonderful.\n\nNta", "What an insufferable bunch, I know is not funny but the \u2018over the top\u2019 reaction made me giggle (it was a very bizarre reaction). Me in your shoes, no more gift from my part, I\u2019ll be pleasant and cordial but would keep them to arms length. Your intentions were good, and by your SIL\u2019s comment of your family they\u2019ve already made prejudiced assumptions about yourself before this whole fiasco, that\u2019s out of your control and not your fault.

You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I'm so confused. You got them thoughtful gifts and they were mad about it? They would have preferred gift cards or stuff they didn't really want? They sound like miserable people. Sorry that happened to you. It's 100% them, not you.", "NTA. I am so sorry your thoughtfulness was taken so so horribly. These people sound awful. Good luck with the rest of your life with these in laws. I like what someone else said, that they practically wanted to hate you. If they were close before covid and then you came along and you\u2019re having his baby, you couldn\u2019t lassoed the moon and they\u2019d still find something wrong with you.

Who says something so cruel to someone when they know they had an unhappy childhood/family life. I\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 has your back but please be aware that you will have to deal with these assholes for your entire married life.  Might be a good idea to establish some boundaries now. \n\nNTA. Also, I\u2019d be delighted by such thoughtful gifts.", "NTA. I think it's a red flag for some of those family members to have responded so cynically.\n\nTo most normal people, you getting them gifts based on what you know about them would be a sign that you want to establish a good relationship with your new family.\n\nBut their reaction might be a sign that they are negative or even toxic people.

They sound like ungrateful jerks to be quite honest.  They are huge AHs - so glad your fianc\u00e9 is supporting you.  Stop apologizing- you have zero reason to apologize for your extremely thoughtful gifts.  They owe you an apology, you owe them NOTHING!", "NTA. Please don\u2019t question yourself on this. His family went overboard with their reactions. If they felt it was personal, all they had to do was ask: \u201cwow, how did you know?\u201d  Then it could\u2019ve been explained that Noah helped you make sure that each gift was thoughtful and tailored to each recipient. To react they way they did is beyond rude, bordering on bizarre. And his sister was WAY out of line. They should apologize to you profusely.", "Nta \nBut familiy of youre bf are ah\nYou sond like a really awsome person caring and loving every person could be happy to have someone like you in theire live", "NTA. That\u2019s so rubbish for you that they reacted like that it\u2019s so rude for people to be like that about presents. At least your fianc\u00e8 is supporting you, SIL\u2019s comments were way out of line.", "Wow, what a terrible way to repay you for those amazing gifts! They were not over the line personal, it just sounds like you put in a lot of effort. If I had been them, I would have felt bad that I had not gotten you as good a present as you had gotten me. Damn, can we do Xmas together next year? ;-)   \nThis family is wayyyyyy off, you are NTA and your fiance sounds like a great one. Cut the ties with that family, they are in the wrong, you are not.", "Nta.\nMaybe they are not used to anyone being so caring and mindful about others' interests or hobbies. They will regret it someday.", "honey, you're NTA.  any family with an ounce of empathy who knew your story would scoop you up as one of their own after you did something like this.  I'm glad your bf stood up for you, he seems like a keeper, and i hope your relationship with them gets better.", "NTA. The proper response to getting a gift is usually Thank You for thinking of me not What are you some kind of stalker?!?!?! The good part is your fiance' stood up for you and that is priceless. Next year get them dollar store mugs with $10 starbucks cards and call in a day. They are not worth your time.", "NTA but next year give them each a joint gift from you and your hubby. Give them each a $10 gift card for amazon. That way you have given them a gift (so they cant complain that they dodnt get anything), it's generic and to be honest $10 more than they deserve.", "NAH, except the sister. She\u2019s TA. The gifts were personal and thoughtful, but that could be off-putting when they don\u2019t know you and wouldn\u2019t have bought you those kind of gifts. It reads like you\u2019re trying way too hard. I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t have conversations with these folks over the months, so you had to have been going through everyone\u2019s social media accounts to ferret out all this information. That\u2019s probably taking things too far when you haven\u2019t met anyone yet. You aren\u2019t to blame because I think healthy interacting with a family is not something you have a lot of experience with, and I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re trying so hard to make a space for yourself that only time can create. \n\nBut what the sister said was inexcusable and incredibly mean. You shouldn\u2019t be willing to accept that from her. She owes you a much bigger apology for deliberate unkindness.", "INFO:  were the gifts from you and Noah or just from you?", "Noah should not have encouraged you to do that kind of gifting to his family, ~~who you have never met in person.~~ The sister is rude for calling you a stalker to your face and insulting your family relationship.\n\nNAH, but you're trying way too hard here to fit into this close family.  Relationships need to develop and grow naturally. I wouldn't be offended by your gifts, but yes I would find them very weird from a person I barely know at all.", "[deleted]", "NAH. \n\nI\u2019m going to go against the grain. \n\nYou put in some serious thought to get your family members really nice gifts. \n\nThe family is allowed to have their feelings. If they view the gifts as too personal, then they were for them. \n\nI think that you and your fianc\u00e9e should have signed both your names on the gifts though. \n\nI don\u2019t know why they are so upset, but I do know they\u2019re allowed to have their feelings about it. \n\nSorry this went in a negative way for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What a slap in the face to call you a stalker and say anything about your family to you. They\u2019re all probably embarrassed that you recognized, listened and remember things they wanted that they didn\u2019t think of or care to get for each other. You\u2019re a great caring human, please do not let these people think you did anything wrong. I\u2019m sorry his family treated you like this. Noah loves you and you are his family. every family has dysfunction and they aren\u2019t excluded from that, clearly.", "NTA, Man this is a really strange reaction. Especially with your BF telling you before hand that they're going to like their presents. I hope you're able to get to the bottom of what was so wrong. Then please update us I'm curious. Best of luck", "NYA. These are the kinds of gifts I love to give and receive. Why wouldn\u2019t you know a lot about them? You\u2019re engaged to their close family member. They\u2019re being ridiculous and don\u2019t deserve you as an in law. I hope your fianc\u00e9 stands up for you with his family.", "NTA you are an angel and they are psychos who clearly have no emotional intelligence or awareness. Take the only good seed, Noah, and run like hell.", "You made clothes for that little girls stuffy!! You are the best!! \n\nNTA\n\nThese people have got issues. What did they buy each other? I feel like maybe they do low effort gifting and might have felt shown up by your thoughtfulness? If so, that's about them not you.", "Holy heck, OP! You are NTA\u2026please don\u2019t think that you are, nor should you ever lose that beautiful and thoughtful nature you have. Just don\u2019t worry about being generous and thought with your in laws anymore\u2026..they just saved you tons of money and time.\n\nI am so glad Noah is supporting you throughout all this and I feel like a low contact or no contact decision might be in your future with his family. It is so unacceptable, rude, and uncalled for.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have apologized at all. You did nothing wrong.", "Nta, I bet they were embarrassed you remember that much and paid attention to them. They probably don\u2019t remember much from conversations or interactions. Smh\n\nDO NOT BLAME YOURSELF. You did nothing wrong. Anyone would be lucky to have someone who actually pays that much attention to them and can buy them a gift based on what they like.", "NTA I am so confused by this! I have always bought presents for people based on what I learn from them by listening to them when they speak or observing them. Now I am wondering if I have been freaking people out and maybe they would prefer more generic gifts.", "INFO: Did they keep the gifts?", "Uhhh\u2026 none of these things seem all that \u201cpersonal\u201d to me, so much as you just kept their basic interests in mind, which is normal. I think all those gifts sound lovely and were appropriate. \n\nNTA. I guess next year everyone can get generic lotion sets since they don\u2019t want anything related to their interests.", "Info: did they actually tell you those things personally over a conversation or you saw their SNS, or heard from your fiance? Ngl kinda creepy that you get them all exactly what they want, cos since you said you only met them once before and only have phone calls, but you can't be talking to everyone?", "My next gift for them would be the finger.", "I just hate that I have managed to cause problems in their family. Noah has always been so close to them and now this is coming between them.", ".... Honestly I think this is a faux flag. They say the issue is the too personal gifts- but something is making me feel like the actual issue is that OP opened up about having been abused and homeless.  \n\n\nThose things (especially being open so 'quickly' in their eyes) gave them a bad feeling and they've decided that OP is a bad person for making them feel anything Other Than Happy on Christmas and that OP must have /been/ a bad person for going through those things.  \n\n\nMaybe I'm just biased as someone who used to work in trauma recovery. But I've seen a lot of survivors mention relationships souring immediately upon opening up- even if the survivor wasn't asking for emotional support/etc. But my spidey senses are tingling.", "I bet they gift each other generic things like ties or perfume and always complain about \"what in the world can you gift someone who already has everything?\". Now they've been shown that it is possible to gift something meaningful and nice, and you don't even have to know the other person for years and years. They feel ashamed and are lashing out instead of being thankful. This is super low.", "Or nothing jeez. What did they get you, OP?", "They are aware. I had mentioned it because they had asked me about my family and especially when we got engaged and wanted to know if there was anyone from my side they should meet. There isn't, so I wanted to be transparent without going into all the uncomfortable details.", "Then OP is NTA", "Yeah, are the gifts offensive, or do they want to keep them, because they can't have it both ways.", "That seems to be what they expected from me, yes. Or maybe like small trinkets. I got gift cards from them. Clearly they felt that was more appropriate for the level of relationship and I feel so bad that I made it uncomfortable for them.", "Yep, Op is amazing, and I wish I was on her list. \n\nIf OP decides to still gift these people anything...$10 starbucks card for everyone... for everything. Graduation, wedding, holidays.... just an impersonal low-cost card. I'd do that for a decade if they never apologize. That and low contact \ud83d\udc4c", "I have been having conversations with them. We talked on the phone before we moved and I have seen them on several occasions since we moved and have actively tried to get to know them.", "Just from me. He got them gifts as well. But gifts are usually given by each member of the family (whether married in or biologically related).", "I had met them before Christmas. I met them for the first time a few months ago but I am still new to them, I know.", "If \"never meeting them in person\" is so pivotal, well, by that criteria, she shouldn't be obligated to get them any gifts at all.\n\nThe only appropriate response to a gift is, \"thank you, it's wonderful.\" If you secretly dislike it, don't use it, regift, etc. But you \\*never\\* attack the giver.", "How can you say N-A-H after what the sister said?", "Since when is a thoughtful gift unwelcomed ?  You are wrong to say that.  I think 99% of people would be happy to receive such gifts.  What was she supposed to get them ? Crap they don\u2019t need or want ?  OP don\u2019t listen to this nonsense.", "She is marrying their son and carrying their grandchild. Of course she is interested in them and wanting to do her best. She didnt get anything weird. and lots of people didnt meet until this year because of covid, they still spoke and videoed", "I had met them before Christmas. But I had not met them before we got engaged.", "I don't understand why people think this way. How does giving someone a gift that they couldn't get otherwise make you TA? Most people would be happy to get a great gift.\n\nMaybe I'm not understanding something but only really toxic people would get mad about something like that imo.", "Hahahahaha what an embarrassing take lmfao. \nNTA.", "The whole point of a wish list is so that people will buy presents off of it. I get one every year for my nieces and nephews. I ask their parents what they haven\u2019t bought yet and then I buy something off the wish list. Why in the world would this be a bad practice? It is literally why the list was created.", "Responding specifically to the quote you used - my SIL does this for my niece and nephew and has for years. She publishes the list to the whole family, and everyone marks off what they\u2019re getting for the kids so there are no repeats. I assume OP\u2019s in laws do something similar of OP had access to the list and knew what the parents were getting. This isn\u2019t weird at all, nor does it make OP the AH", "I see where you\u2019re coming from regarding the gifts being too personal from someone they don\u2019t know that well. However, the proper response to receiving a gift (even if you don\u2019t like it) is \u201cthank you\u201d. \n\nAttacking someone over their choice of gift is disgusting and vile. They could have simply said thank you and maybe pulled Noah aside and let him know that they were uncomfortable with the personal nature of the gifts.", "They\u2019re allowed to have their feelings about it but calling her a stalker makes them TA.", "Thanks for your honesty. I hate that I made them uncomfortable and have caused trouble between them.", "I strongly disagree. While they are in fact allowed to have their feelings, they could have said \"hey, I feel kinda uncomfortable getting such personal gifts from someone I don't know that well. Please don't do that next time.\". Instead they started insulting OP, calling her creepy, a stalker and even saying how it's no wonder her family didn't want her. That's an absolutely disgusting thing to say. The family definitely has multiple assholes.", "I have been working on trauma in therapy. But I do have lots. Being on my own since I was 16 and having a lot of firsts with my fiance (first gift exchange, first time celebrating Christmas, etc) means I sometimes feel like I am a little lost and I always want to try my best now that I do these things, especially here. But sometimes I struggle with the fact I will never have that with my parents or sister and we're working on making me healthier with coping.", "It's possible. I admit I take more notice of these things because I always want to have a good relationship and to show I care. One of the things I was so excited about was becoming part of a loving family. That's something I never had but especially wanted for my child.", "I had met them a few times before. Had spoken to them all a bit more though but yes, this stuff was mentioned when I was talking to them in person. Editing for one thing. I knew his sister was a huge reader but got confirmation from Noah on the books, also checked with him on making sure they actually liked the stuff or with the signed thing for his brother, that it was what it was supposed to be.", "OP should have a deep conversation with her fiance about this situation. \n\nThe family's behavior is so mind-boggingly atrocious that I think something deeper is probably happening -- they're upset that their son is marrying young, or about to become a father in lieu of travelling or going to grad school or whatever, or that they wanted lots of in-laws themselves. Regardless, the couple needs to figure out what is really going on here, and OP needs to figure out whether her fiance is willing to stand up for his spouse to his family over the long term.\n\nUnless they're a \\*really\\* convincing explanation for their behavior (along the lines of \"we were all brainwashed by aliens that morning\"), I think they need to plan to live somewhere other than the fiance's hometown.", "YOU didn\u2019t cause problems- they did.", "Don\u2019t put this on your shoulders, and stop giving energy to people who don\u2019t deserve it. You sound like a sweet person, support your fianc\u00e9 like he supports you and concentrate on the happy.", "You did not cause the problem.  This is 100% on them.  I would be over the moon to have such a kind, generous, and thoughtful DIL as you.", "Just because they\u2019ve been close that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have issues or that they\u2019re not toxic people. Absolutely NTA. You did nothing wrong.", "Well you sound lovely , I think maybe they are just not used to such thoughtful gifts from someone before, hopefully they will open up to you sooner rather than later\u2026 just keep killing them with kindness haha", "Please try to understand that you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Your gifts were extremely kind and thoughtful. His family is acting horribly, not only being rude but also being bullies. They\u2019re 100% in the wrong here. Most people would be touched and grateful that you\u2019re perceptive enough and care enough to find things they\u2019d truly enjoy.", "Could they of responded that way because they got you something small, that took no extra thought. And you did the opposite making them feel inadequate or that they now owe you.", "So all these gifts are things you made/bought based on actual conversations you had with each individual? And you know these folks pretty well on a personal basis? It just seems like a really strong reaction from the entire family. You are NTA, definitely. I\u2019m just not sure the rest of the family is either. Except the sister. She totally is.", "Hmm.  Well, if that's the tradition then NTA.  They sound odd to say the least.", "Thanks for the correction. \n\nBut the rest still stands.  You are someone who is just now being integrated into the family, they don't know you as your fiance does. Those gifts would be appropriate next Christmas, after you're married and will have spent much more time getting to know one another.", "Look at all the old AITA posts where people give their poor cousins new Xboxes and other fancy things for Christmas.", "That's not what happened here", "Thank you for pointing that out. I missed the part they attacked her after, and that they had they had spoken to Noah first. \n\nI re-read the post and they attacked her after speaking to Noah / which definitely makes them the AH for being rude to OP. They easily could have left their discomfort with Noah and cleared the air in the future when it wasn\u2019t so fresh, if it was necessary.", "Exactly. They\u2019re entitled to their feelings but should have been gracious regardless and certainly shouldn\u2019t have insulted and bullied OP. They sound like vile people.\n\nEdit bc autocorrect is ridiculous", "Noah is right to demand they apologize to you. Don\u2019t be so eager to please that you let them disrespect you like that. It\u2019s okay for them not to like your gifts, but they were out of line to bring your family/childhood into it.", "I get it, I\u2019m exactly the same. Me and my boyfriend had our baby in May and even tho I\u2019m still on awkward terms with his parents I made a memory box with the hat the baby came home In and the first picture of all of them, and I remembered his sister likes lazy days so I bought stuff for a lazy day. They however were thankful like your fianc\u00e9s family should be thankful", "Idk I still feel it a bit creepy, if it's just personalized gifts for the parents, sure, but with the others, especially the memorabilia, it'll make me uncomfortable personally. You might feel you're close to them but they could be just being polite, but not close enough yet to you.\n\n\nPs: i often remember random stuffs people told me, but I try not to bring those up with people I'm not close with cos it feels creepy and stalkerish for me if I'm in their place, like why is this person I'm not close to remember what i mentioned offhandedly long time ago\n\n\nETA: but what the sister said is totally uncalled for, that was seriously rude", "Thank you. I'll always support him. He's amazing, like you said, and I am so glad I found him.", "Thank you for saying that to me.", "Yes, it was based on conversations I was involved in and questions I had asked myself (like when Noah and I ask how shopping for the kids was going). Or when Noah's mom had mentioned the jewelry box and we talked about how neither of us ever had something like that. I do take note more. But I also never did Christmas outside of me and Noah so I can understand that it was too much for them.", "I understand. I didn't think it would be too much but I can accept that it was.", "And what is wrong with that exactly?", "How do you know? How do you think OP knew what was on the wish list & what the parents were buying already if it wasn\u2019t shared with her? And why would it be shared with her if they\u2019d be insulted when she bought something from it?", "I understand that. I have never done Christmas with anyone but Noah before and wanted to make sure they enjoyed what I gave them and knew that I appreciated them. But it made them uncomfortable and that was never my intention at all. It did though and I want to learn from this.", "Most people would be thrilled with those gifts.  It wasn\u2019t too much.  Going forward they would get nothing from me.", "Your making a point to upstage everyone else.", "That's a cynical and unreasonable way to look at it. Gift giving isn't a competition. If someone gives out a great gift, it's a good thing for the person who has received the gift and that's all that matters.\n\nSomeone else's ego or vanity should not stop someone who wants to give a good gift from giving a good gift."]}
