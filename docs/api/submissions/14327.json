We have been planning our dream wedding for over a year, and everything is finally falling into place. However, there is one issue that has been causing quite a bit of controversy in our family.\n\nMy nephew (18M), \"James\", has a service dog, \"Max\", for his anxiety and panic attacks. Max is a well-trained and well-behaved dog, and he has been a great help to James over the years. However, I am severely allergic to dogs, to the point where I could have a severe reaction if I am around them for an extended period of time. This is something my family is well aware of.\n\nWhen we sent out the invitations for our wedding, we made it clear that there would be a strict no pets policy, due to my allergies. James and his parents approached us and asked if Max could be an exception, as he is a service dog and not just a pet. They assured us that Max would be on his best behavior, and that he would not cause any problems.\n\nAs much as I understand the importance of Max to James, I had to say no. My wedding day is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, and I do not want to risk having a severe allergic reaction during the ceremony or reception. I explained this to James and his parents, and I offered to help find alternative accommodations for Max during the wedding.\n\nHowever, my decision has caused a lot of controversy in the family. Some of my relatives believe that I am being selfish and inconsiderate, while others understand my point of view and support my decision. James is understandably upset, and I feel terrible about the situation.\n\nSo, AITA for not allowing my nephew to bring his service dog to my wedding?", "created_utc": 1681003219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g4l0g/aita_for_not_letting_my_nephew_bring_his_service/", "score": 356, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With that in mind, I personally would opt out of attending which your nephew may decide to do.\n\nThe only way I'd say y.t.a. is if you were throwing a stink about him having to attend but *also* couldn't bring the dog.   There are options you could try depending on allergy severity but that's entirely up to you. Non drowsy allergy pills, but they require a week or so of build up. If outdoors keeping him away from you. Or a fresh bath and coat blow out and a clean body suit - usually what is opted for when therapy dogs visit hospitals.

You have done everything correct. Contacted family to explain and offer to find other ways to help Max. If he chooses not to attend that\u2019s on him", "NTA. There are very few times I'd side with someone refusing a service dog, but this is one of them. Allergic reaction are miserable at best and fetal at worst. You absolutely should not have to deal with that on your wedding day. James and his parents were invited, that doesn't mean they're required to be there. Accept the fact they may not attend. Maybe offer to live stream it if possible.", "NTA these are competing disabilities to consider here.

Does an 18 year old boy who has such bad anxiety and panic attacks that he needs a service dog really want to be at a wedding for hours with dozens of people he probably doesn\u2019t even know?

We have been planning our dream wedding for over a year, and everything is finally falling into place. However, there is one issue that has been causing quite a bit of controversy in our family.\n\nMy nephew (18M), \"James\", has a service dog, \"Max\", for his anxiety and panic attacks. Max is a well-trained and well-behaved dog, and he has been a great help to James over the years. However, I am severely allergic to dogs, to the point where I could have a severe reaction if I am around them for an extended period of time. This is something my family is well aware of.\n\nWhen we sent out the invitations for our wedding, we made it clear that there would be a strict no pets policy, due to my allergies. James and his parents approached us and asked if Max could be an exception, as he is a service dog and not just a pet. They assured us that Max would be on his best behavior, and that he would not cause any problems.\n\nAs much as I understand the importance of Max to James, I had to say no. My wedding day is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, and I do not want to risk having a severe allergic reaction during the ceremony or reception. I explained this to James and his parents, and I offered to help find alternative accommodations for Max during the wedding.\n\nHowever, my decision has caused a lot of controversy in the family. Some of my relatives believe that I am being selfish and inconsiderate, while others understand my point of view and support my decision. James is understandably upset, and I feel terrible about the situation.\n\nSo, AITA for not allowing my nephew to bring his service dog to my wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am, however, not a fan of minimizing emotional/mental needs over physical (\u201cif they were blind it would be different\u201d", "\u201cIf the dog\u2019s mere presence provides comfort, it is not a service animal under the ADA. But if the dog is trained to perform a task related to a person\u2019s disability, it is a service animal under the ADA. For example, if the dog has been trained to sense that an anxiety attack is about to happen and take a specific action to help avoid the attack or lessen its impact, the dog is a service animal.\u201d", "All true SERVICE animals I have come across have gone through extensive training and certification processes. Thank you for pointing out that may not be universal. \n\nHowever, it is still not appropriate to minimize someone\u2019s use of a support dog for managing their symptoms/disabilities. The use of a support dog IS protected by the ADA.", "Lol love the scenario. And yes, I agree! Ultimately the bride and groom can set whatever rules they want for their wedding (child free, everyone wears pink, whatever they want). Just don\u2019t be surprised if some people choose not to attend because the parameters don\u2019t work for them. \n\nCase in point - we have been invited to a child free family wedding (out of town) in a few months. All of our normal sitters will be AT the wedding and we don\u2019t have anyone that can do overnight for the kiddos. We love our family and want to be there, but we also respect their decision. So they may end up with my husband and me, just one of us, or neither of us depending on what we can arrange. Not personal, just life circumstances! Similar here - he can\u2019t be without his dog. Dog not allowed\u2026ok I can\u2019t go. (Although the family could drop it after that have already requested and exception and been told no\u2026that would make OP\u2019s life better!)", "Same here. Honestly the real assholes here are allergies and as anxiety.", "He's probably the same paramedic that responded to my college roommate's call of shortness of breath (she was an asthmatic and we both had been battling bronchitis) by screaming \"WHAT FUCKING DRUGS ARE YOU ON\" over and over while she was turning blue.", "If you're allergic to dogs don't dare someone with a service dog? Common sense, y'all aren't victims bc your nose gets stuffy sometimes", "Gotcha and I think you're completely right. Neither need is more important than the other, they're just different \ud83d\ude42. I have a master's in social work and am a huge supporter of acknowledging mental health needs and providing supports for people who need/want them.", "You must have mistakenly replied to the wrong message, because you're not addressing anything in the parent post.", "The use of a support dog isn\u2019t protected for private events, like a wedding.", ">However, it is still not appropriate to minimize someone\u2019s use of a support dog for managing their symptoms/disabilities. The use of a support dog IS protected by the ADA.\n\nThe ADA doesn't grant anyone the right to attend someone's wedding with a dog over their objections. It does not apply here.", " | The use of a support dog IS protected by the ADA.\n\n\nNo, it's not. There is a difference between a support animal and a service animal. According to the ADA, service animals are permitted anywhere their humans go, and support animals are not. \n\nService animals are trained to perform a task/job. A support animal is there to provide comfort and not to aid a person with a disability. Service animals do not have to be certified, just trained to perform a task or service(and obedient). No professional training is required. \n\nEx. Service aminals are allowed in food establishments and areas where animals are prohibited for food safety reasons. Support animals are not.\n\nETA: the difference doesn't apply to the OP because it's a no go either way.", "Agreed. Hoping we can solve things in the next ten years. Medical future is bright.", "I feel bad about my comment, maybe it was uncalled for, but seriously what paramedic dismisses allergies concerns and shames a person?", "Dog allergies are not generally deadly but anaphylactic shock caused by dog allergy can be. It isn't always just a \"stuffy nose\" and calling it that while disregarding that allergies can have severe and deadly consequences is pretty shitty.", "Read my other comments. I never said it was. I am in full support that the bride can exclude the dog.", "If you had read my full comment above, I said that I had NO problem with the bride saying they could not accommodate the service animal. Just be ok with people not attending. I never inferred this situation was covered by ADA, I was commenting more in general with service dogs.", "Unfortunately, too many. I had a friend whose mom is an RN and doesn't believe food allergies are a thing. She tried to trick my friend into eating tomatoes, and my friend was kind enough to respond by vomiting on her.", "I'm allergic to most animals, I simply would not date someone who owns one of those animals instead of expecting them to get rid of it LMAO", "She should be in prison.", "That's totally fair! But your comments were being quite unfair towards other people. Unfortunately, some allergies do develop randomly and there is always the chance with having kids that the baby is born and ends up allergic to animals. Potentially having to rehome pets due to allergies is a valid issue and demonizing people for it isn't okay."]}
