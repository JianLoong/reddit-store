We have been planning our dream wedding for over a year, and everything is finally falling into place. However, there is one issue that has been causing quite a bit of controversy in our family.\n\nMy nephew (18M), \"James\", has a service dog, \"Max\", for his anxiety and panic attacks. Max is a well-trained and well-behaved dog, and he has been a great help to James over the years. However, I am severely allergic to dogs, to the point where I could have a severe reaction if I am around them for an extended period of time. This is something my family is well aware of.\n\nWhen we sent out the invitations for our wedding, we made it clear that there would be a strict no pets policy, due to my allergies. James and his parents approached us and asked if Max could be an exception, as he is a service dog and not just a pet. They assured us that Max would be on his best behavior, and that he would not cause any problems.\n\nAs much as I understand the importance of Max to James, I had to say no. My wedding day is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, and I do not want to risk having a severe allergic reaction during the ceremony or reception. I explained this to James and his parents, and I offered to help find alternative accommodations for Max during the wedding.\n\nHowever, my decision has caused a lot of controversy in the family. Some of my relatives believe that I am being selfish and inconsiderate, while others understand my point of view and support my decision. James is understandably upset, and I feel terrible about the situation.\n\nSo, AITA for not allowing my nephew to bring his service dog to my wedding?", "created_utc": 1681003219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g4l0g/aita_for_not_letting_my_nephew_bring_his_service/", "score": 6031, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With that in mind, I personally would opt out of attending which your nephew may decide to do.\n\nThe only way I'd say y.t.a. is if you were throwing a stink about him having to attend but *also* couldn't bring the dog.   There are options you could try depending on allergy severity but that's entirely up to you. Non drowsy allergy pills, but they require a week or so of build up. If outdoors keeping him away from you. Or a fresh bath and coat blow out and a clean body suit - usually what is opted for when therapy dogs visit hospitals.

You have done everything correct. Contacted family to explain and offer to find other ways to help Max. If he chooses not to attend that\u2019s on him", "NTA. There are very few times I'd side with someone refusing a service dog, but this is one of them. Allergic reaction are miserable at best and fetal at worst. You absolutely should not have to deal with that on your wedding day. James and his parents were invited, that doesn't mean they're required to be there. Accept the fact they may not attend. Maybe offer to live stream it if possible.", "NTA these are competing disabilities to consider here.

Does an 18 year old boy who has such bad anxiety and panic attacks that he needs a service dog really want to be at a wedding for hours with dozens of people he probably doesn\u2019t even know?

We have been planning our dream wedding for over a year, and everything is finally falling into place. However, there is one issue that has been causing quite a bit of controversy in our family.\n\nMy nephew (18M), \"James\", has a service dog, \"Max\", for his anxiety and panic attacks. Max is a well-trained and well-behaved dog, and he has been a great help to James over the years. However, I am severely allergic to dogs, to the point where I could have a severe reaction if I am around them for an extended period of time. This is something my family is well aware of.\n\nWhen we sent out the invitations for our wedding, we made it clear that there would be a strict no pets policy, due to my allergies. James and his parents approached us and asked if Max could be an exception, as he is a service dog and not just a pet. They assured us that Max would be on his best behavior, and that he would not cause any problems.\n\nAs much as I understand the importance of Max to James, I had to say no. My wedding day is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, and I do not want to risk having a severe allergic reaction during the ceremony or reception. I explained this to James and his parents, and I offered to help find alternative accommodations for Max during the wedding.\n\nHowever, my decision has caused a lot of controversy in the family. Some of my relatives believe that I am being selfish and inconsiderate, while others understand my point of view and support my decision. James is understandably upset, and I feel terrible about the situation.\n\nSo, AITA for not allowing my nephew to bring his service dog to my wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

James could constantly be an A H, and that could be a reason or James could be a really sweet, now young, adult, who wants to go to his aunt wedding, but won\u2019t be able to without Max for his mental health. \n\nFifth, from the information I got in the post, asking to be able to go shows interest and that he wants to go and see his aunt get married. OP mentioned that she has an allergic reaction reaction that happens over an extended period of time. It makes me wonder if OP has been around Max for short periods of time. James could have just been excited for his aunt, and he couldn\u2019t wait to see her get married. James could hold a grudge on his future uncle, and he wanted to sabotage the wedding. The point is that we don\u2019t know, and everything we put in these decisions need to take that into account.  To say that your dog \u201cwill not cause any problems\u201d seems like they are willing to do what they need to do with Max not to cause an issue or scene at the wedding. After all, causing an allergic reaction is creating a problem.\n\nSixth, I saw another comment mentioned the same thing\u2026 yes, the wedding would be pointless if the bride or the groom can\u2019t show up.

That\u2019s when this wrecking ball lost control, and ended up hitting a building it wasn\u2019t supposed to.\n\nWe don\u2019t know any other reason why James\u2019 asked to bring his dog because a service animal is different than a pet. \n\nINFO: OP, is that the only reason (and that he needs his dog)?

Neither of you can really compromise without it causing harm to your health, so the best path forward would be to find some way to include them where they do not have to be at the same location at the same time.\n\nI might also suggest, if going without Max *is* an option, finding other ways to accommodate James' needs. Maybe having a designated quiet space where he can come and leave the wedding as he needs, where the wedding is being streamed so he doesn't miss out.

For example, an allergy sufferer who arrives at a restaurant after a person with a service dog may have to wait for that person to leave before being seated, but once that person with allergies who has requested and received the accommodation of being seated in a dog-free room is seated, if another person with a service dog arrives, the restaurant cannot refuse them service, but can require them to wait until the person with allergies leaves to be served. This is more of an issue in workplaces, schools, dorms, etc where sustained close contact creates bigger issues for the person with allergies and the place is harder to avoid (someone with allergies can just pick a different restaurant but it is significantly more complicated for a child with allergies to avoid their local public school, for example). This is obviously only an issue when the allergies are severe enough to be a qualifying disability under the ADA, but it is misleading not to acknowledge that it is also an ADA violation to refuse to accommodate someone with allergies that do reach that level.", "The dog can take over.

They learn to pick up on the smallest of signs and symptoms and, with good training, do so incredibly. At this point, my dog does **exactly what you describe**, he usually boops me repeatedly in the thigh (and not always gently) until my attention is on him. If I'm really, really distracted he will jump up at me and put all his weight on me.\n\nAt this point, the goal isn't to get me to a safe space and he won't try to do that. It's to try to ground me in the here and now and distract me, orienting me in the present. Almost like an anchor, if that makes sense? But, it also makes me aware of what might be coming so I can evaluate the situation and check in with how I'm feeling. Often, the distraction works wonders and I can continue about my day as normal.\n\nIf I do begin having sensory flashbacks, that's when my dog goes from preventative actions to mitigating damage. I can't really speak when I'm having them (I'm not really in the here and now) and I panic a lot, especially if they happen in a crowded area. That's when my dog will just take control and navigate me out of that situation. He doesn't wait for permission or hand gestures, but he's been specifically trained not to.\n\nIf it was one of my personal worst case scenarios and I was having what I consider to be a full flashback, I usually end up sitting down. He then puts his body across my legs, keeping me safe, and is trained to pass a card detailing my condition to anyone who approaches.\n\nWhen I've seen my friend's dogs task, ones trained to handle Anxiety Disorders specifically, they behave in a very similar manner. They can tell something is going to occur before their owners can, and will begin distracting their owners or actively helping them in other ways.

This then compounds the issue that one disabled person\u2019s accommodation or reasonable adjustment can be someone else\u2019s risk because disabilities are not monoliths.\n\nIt\u2019s quite common for adjustments to \u2018clash\u2019.

If you choose that, go for it but by saying it is a reasonable adjustment for all pet allergies as so often gets said here is no different to the \u2018just one bite of Reeses\u2019 pushing on food allergies and leads to such aggression when the allergy is severe.\n\nAlso it is not actually advised for many people who have allergies to keep pushing through with exposure and meds as it can make the allergy worse over time or lead to other allergies and autoimmune issues. I\u2019m not allergic to animals but I often notice the disparity in how people who are get talked about and it leads to stuff like this where hurt is caused unnecessarily.\n\nIt also concerns me giving shitty medical advice is seen as so normalised on these threads. Food allergies weren\u2019t well know when I was a kid so I kept exposing myself not realising and it has not got better. In fact it\u2019s got worse and worse and the meds are less effective.

I've seen it a lot working retail.\n\nBut by all means, we should ask the OP for clarification on what tasks the dog performs for the nephew's health for a concrete answer.\n\nEdit: I've asked and hopefully OP will respond.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g4l0g/aita_for_not_letting_my_nephew_bring_his_service/jfk3arq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nEdit 2: According to the ADA's FAQ:\n\n>The ADA makes a distinction between psychiatric service animals and emotional support animals. If the dog has been trained to sense that an anxiety attack is about to happen and take a specific action to help avoid the attack or lessen its impact, that would qualify as a service animal. However, if the dog\u2019s mere presence provides comfort, that would not be considered a service animal under the ADA.\n\nI'll wait for the OP to tell us what the dog does, then", "*you wouldn't steal an allergy*", "Depending on the level, medication does crap all. Anxiety is hard to treat and honestly anti anxiety meds need to be banned as they are dangerous and addictive. They aren\u2019t even used often for prescription here in Aus because the studies show how dangerous they can be to the person. Most of the time its antidepressants, antipsychotics and blood pressure meds that they use as they are less dangerous long term. \n\nMeds in general are ahhhh but anti anxiety are horrible. \n\nI do agree that the bride takes priority but he could just stay home. But this is more than just \u201ctake meds and get over it\u201d.", ">\"maybe they should stay home\" is a microaggression against disabled people.\n\nIf you'd worded this as:\n\n>\"maybe they should stay home\" is seen as a microaggression by disabled people\n\nI would have 100% been with you. I've been chronically ill before, it was debilitating (I was on a disability benefit because I couldn't work). So the latter wording, I get that.\n\nBut it's not a phrase that's *solely* used *against* disabled people. It's a phrase that's used commonly with various people, and like I said, it's not always a *literal* \"stay home\" sentiment (in my experience [which I acknowledge is subjective and therefore also limited] it's usually meant as \"don't come [to XYZ event]\").\n\nSo, I get where you're coming from. But I'm also acknowledging that we're human, and projection is common when it comes to topics that we're sensitive to. Allergies can also be disabling for example, but you're only championing one side of this \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I believe they do, though I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever tested with them to know for certain!\n\nShe\u2019s allergic to cats but less severely and still reacts to hypoallergenic cats and hairless cats (with cats apparently it\u2019s something in their saliva as well, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the same case with dogs), but she doesn\u2019t react as badly to the hypoallergenic and hairless ones as other cats, though still reacts.  \n\nMaybe we\u2019ll have to find someone with a hairless dog and someone with a hypoallergenic dog and test it out some weekend when nothing else is going on, for science!  Start at a large distance and let them slowly inch closer or something to see if she starts to react to either", "It is a psychiatric service dog, *not* an emotional support animal. The tasks for anxiety and such can include things like providing therapeutic pressure during an anxiety attack.", "Houston too.", "Definitely NTA! The family members who has a issue with it are clearly TA's! Allergies trumps anxieties everytime! Do they really want the bride taken ill during the wedding so nephew can have his dog! SMH!

Allergy medication, inhalers, and masking can only do so much.\n\nI was on a flight maybe 6 years ago and departure was delayed significantly waiting for the needed plane to fly in and empty out.  Which gave everyone time to scope out who we were traveling with.  2 different furry pets/service animals and a cranky toddler.\n\nI asked the airline personnel where the pets would be in the plane, snd said I\u2019d choose sitting next to the cranky 2 year old over either of the furry animals.\n\nGuess who was already scheduled to sit next to?  I was cheerful and helped the mom entertain her.  She stayed entertained and happy.", "But the dog's actual designation doesn't matter here. James could be completely blind and Max could be the world's greatest guide dog, but OP would still be allergic. Conversely, it sounds like OP would be fine with James having his ESA there if she didn't have a medical condition herself.", "I actually said NAH because of competing access needs so I am championing both sides. \n\nAnd yeah, phrases that are microaggressions when said to/about one marginalized group in context of their marginalization can be said to non group members and be perfectly fine. Calling an Olympic medalist inspiring is different than calling a special Olympics athlete inspiring. Commenting on a white person's hair is different than commenting on a black person's hair. Calling a white person articulate is different than a POC. Saying an abled person should maybe stay home is different than saying maybe a disabled person should. \n\nWe don't \\*see\\* things as microaggressions. They are. The fact that people use them without conscious negative intention is what makes them \\*micro\\* instead of just aggressions.", "They got baskets for that, goes under the tail.", "OP doesn't say if the dog performs tasks or if the dog is just there for comfort, so", "It\u2019s not really about which condition trumps which, it\u2019s about the fact that the bride being present (and not ill or struggling to breathe) at her own wedding trumps a relative guest being able to attend. \n\nIt\u2019s the bride\u2019s wedding, she, and her well-being, takes priority over the bride\u2019s nephew being able to attend.", "This comment made my night! \ud83e\udd23", "If it's a legitimate allergy, the service dog's body has ways of shutting that whole thing down.", "No worries! I myself didn't realise just how effective Assistance Dogs can be until I saw my friend who has PTSD too interact with his, it changed my world.

Imma give him some treats now.", "I've heard all of these things claimed by ESA owners trying to pass their dogs off as service animals.", "That is amazing! Waking a person up from night terrors is one of the tasks my dog is trained for and it can be **really, really difficult** to train them to wake you up gently. The fact that your elderly cat has worked out how to do this on their own is adorable - and says so much about the role our pets play in our lives.\n\nYour cat definitely deserves all of the treats, it sounds like he plays a massive support role!"]}
