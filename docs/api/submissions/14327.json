We have been planning our dream wedding for over a year, and everything is finally falling into place. However, there is one issue that has been causing quite a bit of controversy in our family.\n\nMy nephew (18M), \"James\", has a service dog, \"Max\", for his anxiety and panic attacks. Max is a well-trained and well-behaved dog, and he has been a great help to James over the years. However, I am severely allergic to dogs, to the point where I could have a severe reaction if I am around them for an extended period of time. This is something my family is well aware of.\n\nWhen we sent out the invitations for our wedding, we made it clear that there would be a strict no pets policy, due to my allergies. James and his parents approached us and asked if Max could be an exception, as he is a service dog and not just a pet. They assured us that Max would be on his best behavior, and that he would not cause any problems.\n\nAs much as I understand the importance of Max to James, I had to say no. My wedding day is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, and I do not want to risk having a severe allergic reaction during the ceremony or reception. I explained this to James and his parents, and I offered to help find alternative accommodations for Max during the wedding.\n\nHowever, my decision has caused a lot of controversy in the family. Some of my relatives believe that I am being selfish and inconsiderate, while others understand my point of view and support my decision. James is understandably upset, and I feel terrible about the situation.\n\nSo, AITA for not allowing my nephew to bring his service dog to my wedding?", "created_utc": 1681003219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g4l0g/aita_for_not_letting_my_nephew_bring_his_service/", "score": 1752, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With that in mind, I personally would opt out of attending which your nephew may decide to do.\n\nThe only way I'd say y.t.a. is if you were throwing a stink about him having to attend but *also* couldn't bring the dog.   There are options you could try depending on allergy severity but that's entirely up to you. Non drowsy allergy pills, but they require a week or so of build up. If outdoors keeping him away from you. Or a fresh bath and coat blow out and a clean body suit - usually what is opted for when therapy dogs visit hospitals.

You have done everything correct. Contacted family to explain and offer to find other ways to help Max. If he chooses not to attend that\u2019s on him", "NTA. There are very few times I'd side with someone refusing a service dog, but this is one of them. Allergic reaction are miserable at best and fetal at worst. You absolutely should not have to deal with that on your wedding day. James and his parents were invited, that doesn't mean they're required to be there. Accept the fact they may not attend. Maybe offer to live stream it if possible.", "NTA these are competing disabilities to consider here. Ordinarily I\u2019d say they don\u2019t rank they just both need to be accommodated but in this case it\u2019s YOUR wedding.

Does an 18 year old boy who has such bad anxiety and panic attacks that he needs a service dog really want to be at a wedding for hours with dozens of people he probably doesn\u2019t even know?

You having a reaction to a guest's dog will not only endanger your physical health, but ruin the day for everyone.

We have been planning our dream wedding for over a year, and everything is finally falling into place. However, there is one issue that has been causing quite a bit of controversy in our family.\n\nMy nephew (18M), \"James\", has a service dog, \"Max\", for his anxiety and panic attacks. Max is a well-trained and well-behaved dog, and he has been a great help to James over the years. However, I am severely allergic to dogs, to the point where I could have a severe reaction if I am around them for an extended period of time. This is something my family is well aware of.\n\nWhen we sent out the invitations for our wedding, we made it clear that there would be a strict no pets policy, due to my allergies. James and his parents approached us and asked if Max could be an exception, as he is a service dog and not just a pet. They assured us that Max would be on his best behavior, and that he would not cause any problems.\n\nAs much as I understand the importance of Max to James, I had to say no. My wedding day is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, and I do not want to risk having a severe allergic reaction during the ceremony or reception. I explained this to James and his parents, and I offered to help find alternative accommodations for Max during the wedding.\n\nHowever, my decision has caused a lot of controversy in the family. Some of my relatives believe that I am being selfish and inconsiderate, while others understand my point of view and support my decision. James is understandably upset, and I feel terrible about the situation.\n\nSo, AITA for not allowing my nephew to bring his service dog to my wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP mentioned that she has an allergic reaction reaction that happens over an extended period of time. It makes me wonder if OP has been around Max for short periods of time. James could have just been excited for his aunt, and he couldn\u2019t wait to see her get married. James could hold a grudge on his future uncle, and he wanted to sabotage the wedding. The point is that we don\u2019t know, and everything we put in these decisions need to take that into account.  To say that your dog \u201cwill not cause any problems\u201d seems like they are willing to do what they need to do with Max not to cause an issue or scene at the wedding. After all, causing an allergic reaction is creating a problem.\n\nSixth, I saw another comment mentioned the same thing\u2026 yes, the wedding would be pointless if the bride or the groom can\u2019t show up.

They contacted her, asking for an exception. She couldn't make one, but offered to do the best she could to accommodate. How on earth does that sound like she's saying at all what you think she's saying? *They* reached out to *her*. She said no. I'm pretty sure she understands better than we do whether or not or how able to handle being apart from Max James is, and I see no reason to think she's trying to demand he be there, she seems to be trying very hard to not make him feel unwanted, but otherwise is not here expressing anything but disappointment that James won't be able to make it (and, specifically, her own guilt that he feels left out), nor implying that he would be the AH for not doing so.", "Even with a epi pen, it would still require a trip to the hospital. Which is something the bride would not want to do on her wedding day.", "This is how I took it as well. That she fully understands James\u2019 needs, and is trying to offer an alternative so he is able to come alone, but definitely not forcing him to attend. She is trying to ensure he doesn\u2019t feel left out. She is the bride, she has to be there, and has to be able to function. \n\nAs a parent in this situation, I would be seeking advice from my son\u2019s paediatrician, not attacking the bride, who already has enough on her plate! \n\nMy son get extremely distressed and anxious, and on one occasion when we were required to travel by plane, I simply discussed medication options as a one off for the trip to prevent anxiety attacks."]}
