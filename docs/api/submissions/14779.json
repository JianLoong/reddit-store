She's home alone, not working, feels worthless and wants to test his love to feel better.", "Also he said no. That should have been enough.", "Either that or it's a control thing. She might be trying to establish control over him by attempting to make him do something she knows will be humiliating for him.", "NTA. This is not a rom com. This is real life.", "I had to carry a woman once. It was way back on a college trip and one of the girls got broken up with and she was sobbing uncontrollably in the hall so I came out to see what was going on and her friends asked me to literally pick her up and put her down in one of their rooms. Which I obviously did but it was one of the most awkward experiences of my life lol.", "I can\u2019t believe she would CHOOSE to be carried? I\u2019m disabled and a part time wheelchair user and sometimes the elevator is broken or there just isn\u2019t one. A well-meaning abled person undoubtedly will jump in and offer to carry me  up the stairs/wherever I need to go. I always say NO! I am not a sack of potatoes! I can\u2019t think of anything more embarrassing than just sitting there while being carried. And she is completely able-bodied! She doesn\u2019t even have an excuse!", "I had been stuck in the house for a week after surgery. Went to the grocery store with my husband just get out. Made it down one aisle and it was too painful to continue. He told me to slowly walk to the front and he met me by the entrance with the car. I like your husband better.", "in your case your husband could atleast give a valid medical reason, embarrasing maybe but when people from work asked he could explain, in this case, what could he say may girlfriend was beeing childish?", "My husband carried me a handful of times but mostly only when my knee pops out of socket and I'm in agony. Even when we got married I carried HIM for photos. \n\nGirl needs a reality check.", "\nHe has two legs and a heartbeat and can walk on his own", "My husband did that carry me over the threshold thing after our wedding. And frankly, my greater issues had to do with embarrassment and a concern about him dropping me. I'm small. But, uh un. I don't think I'll bounce and I don't want to find out - let alone find out with an audience. \ud83d\ude02", "I cannot fathom a girl begging to be carried... in public no less.\r  \n\r  \nI commend your willingness to let your husband do what was necessary. I frequently have trouble walking and refuse to let my SO carry me, Ever. I'd rather crawl than be carried, and I have in fact crawled to avoid being carried. It annoys him so much that I won't let him carry me when I need it.", "I mean most people use throwaway accounts so they don't have something stupid tied to their main?", " I would be evaluating the maturity level of gf.", "Could also be that she thinks that it would show OPs love for her, romantic gesture or some shit she she on tiktok about dating and relationships.  \"If he really loves you, put him to the test\" that sort of mindset.", "My husband came to have lunch at work with me a few times when he was on break from his work (they don\u2019t work year-round) but it was a handful of times over a few years. Unless I forget something I absolutely need (bare essentials are my phone, laptop, drivers license, car key, work badge), he\u2019s not bringing me anything. If I forget my lunch I buy some or go without. I forget my makeup? Not needed. Sweater because the office gets cold sometimes? I\u2019ll be chilly. We live 40 minutes from my office so even the lunch visits were a special occasional event.", "Or watching too many romcom and dramas.", "Good day! You look reasonably sane! What are you doing here? Are you a cleric or something?", "Sure. Do it at home then. This girl is weird. I bet she wants him to put his jacket over puddles for her  when it rains too.", "I've been in the middle of gall bladder pancreatitis whick needed emergency surgery and I didn't ask anyone to carry me anywhere!", "Sounds more like a tiktok trend to me", "Being tired is clearly a guise for being treated like a baby, if you have an age play kink you gotta talk to your partner first and maybe not try that at their place of work\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80", "This was my first thought.  Too much time on her hands to binge watch movies.", "Nicely done lol", "Even when I had a smashed up knee a couple of years ago and my boyfriend at the time *offered* to carry me to a cab I said no because it felt really fucking weird as a grown ass adult to be carried around.", "It\u2019s really only cute when you\u2019re taking it to the bedroom\u2026 and even then, it\u2019s only cute if it\u2019s not being asked. Unless she\u2019s actually injured, she has no reason to ask to be carried. And even then, 8 floors is a huge risk to carry someone down. So much could go wrong. She really should know this at 25.", "Maybe she is a dog\u2026\n\n-she\u2019s always around for food\n\n-always wants attention\n\n-gets attention, then promptly demands more. \n\n-jealous of the potential of ANOTHER dog getting any attention from HER Man. \n\nTerritorial, pees on things, cranky and demanding. I\u2019ve got it!!\n\nShe\u2019s 3 chihuahuas in a trench coat.", "An office worker and a gentleman.", "\"Sleepless in Shipping\"", "Not even a rom com, possibly The Office", "This is a fantasy.", "Lean into it & carry her caveman style over your shoulder. Either she won't ask again or she gets horny & you get some when you come home, win win \ud83d\ude09", "Why would you be snotty to someone offering to help you get to where you need to go? You could just say no thank you. Otherwise what would you prefer people to do, just ignore you and let you sit there forever?", "I've been carried by necessity though. I was just to damn sick to care, so sick I wouldn't have cared if they dropped me either. I've progressed enough I only need a chair once in a great while.", "Lol thanks, I like him a lot too!\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. Most people do not understand why help is sometimes needed\u2026that when you\u2019re in constant pain, every little action is pain. You start planning your next steps on what the pain allows. \n\nHopefully your hubby was having a dense moment (mine gets those a lot too lol) and didn\u2019t really comprehend how difficult that lil trip was for you.", "Hell no!! If he didnt want to carry you he should\u2019ve went and asked for an electric cart or a wheelchair (i dont know if its common but when i worked at a grocery store we had wheelchairs for emergencies)", "Yea, there\u2019s no good reason OP could give his colleagues for this one. His girlfriend was being childish and immature, but I\u2019m glad OP saw that and stood up for themselves rather than acquiescing to her rather insecure request. \n\nFor all we know, that move could have put OP on someone\u2019s shit list, leaving him unemployed as well. Think OP needs to, at minimum, sit down and have a very serious chat about her behavior and the future of their relationship.\n\nETA: was only carried at a social outing and once at the mall. Never at a place of work. I would have hobbled my broken butt downstairs as slowly as needed, as long as I wouldn\u2019t be paraded around in front of my coworkers. No thanks.", "You two sound adorable!", "Ummm, HWAT?", "At 25 these adults should not be so influenced on social media. It's pathetic.", "Yeah, I wonder if she's a KDrama fan?  Most of the Kdrama romances have the male lead carrying the female lead at some point.  It's usually when she's drunk/hurt, but it's one of the markers on the road to twu luv.", "No? Really? Then I have no qualms telling you. There's a fine stash of treasure right down that hole! I found it first, but we're friends now! Go on, take a peek. It'll shimmer you blind! Heh heh heh...", "But me ladies ankles must not get wet", "Oh, I totally agree, I just caught the reference of what she wanted to do. Like some others have pointed out, \"more like An Office and a gentleman\".", "Would you carry me across your office if I was a worm?", "Right, we don\u2019t want to surprise someone with that type of fantasy request !", "Exactly!!", "Bro has never heard of professionalism at a work place", "Of course he does when his girlfriend is making ridiculous requests. Every thinking person with any sense will think more of embarrassing and debasing themselves to their coworkers (and shout they\u2019re in a codependent crazy relationship) when confronted with such a ridiculous request. \n\nJust because someone is your SO doesn\u2019t make everything they say true or right or correct. The correct thing for his gf to take away from it is \u201cl will get shot down when I make crazy demands\u201d.", "Yay, this guy gets it.", "I was thinking the same thing lol", "\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "How to lose a guy in 1 day", "25?

Nyah hah hah hah!", "I\u2019m not saying do it, I\u2019m saying don\u2019t tell her the actual reason. You\u2019ll learn.", "I\u2019m going to have that song stuck in my head all day.", "Lol this is my favorite", "My son is 23 and I would feel like a failure personally if he wasn't confident enough to live his own life instead of obsessing about some rando on the Internet.", "Scary and sad that these people can't just have their own life and need to be influenced into having someone else's fake life."]}
