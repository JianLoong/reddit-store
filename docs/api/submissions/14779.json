Simple as that. If she was capable of walking, she should have. (Or just taken an elevator. I assume your building has one?)", "NTA, she's a grown adult without medical issues, she can walk.

Do you ever carry her? \n\nShe could have sat down for a bit, walked slower instead, used your arm, etc. Making a big show of carrying someone though isn\u2019t commonplace and would definitely cause some staring.
