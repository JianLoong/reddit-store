She was honest and told you she couldn't handle a relationship with you. That's not the wrong thing to do. There is nothing to warn anybody about, and the fact that now the whole school is talking about her probably has her feeling so small and making her anxiety a thousand times worse. That's not right at all. What bothers me too is how there is such a lack of sympathy on your part or understanding. You call her mental health BS and don't seem to express any empathy. This isn't how you treat people, especially when they reveal their problems to you. Doesn't sound like you are grown up and mature enough for a girlfriend.

Have a little sympathy.\n\nHow would you react if she started telling people you\u2019re an insensitive, egotistical person? Not well right?\n\nI\u2019d apologize to her.

It was a very askhole move on your part.\n\nUnless you experience something serious like manipulation or some other form of abuse at the hands of someone you date, it will never ever be your job to jump on bro yelp to spread bad feedback after a breakup. Honestly the most feedback that should ever happen is what was good about them followed by \"we just didn't click\" or \"We mostly argued\" simple, open ended things that actively avoid any attempt to go scorched earth on your ex's near future dating opportunities.\n\nYou'll definitely fvck up again, it's part of existing, especially when you're still pretty new to existence,  but hopefully you'll learn from this and do better next time.\n\nOH!
