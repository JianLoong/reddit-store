They are the dumbasses here.", "I\u2019m going to take a while guess and say you are one of this child\u2019s parents trying to justify their actions in this story.", "Those parents need to get better. They\u2019re failing.", "I think AppleCare would tell them they are not fixing anymore after the first couple, breaking an IPad every few weeks is a lot.", "\\*Take the ipad,  It's bought with OPs money, its his.  Go sell that shit and buy yourself something cool for your birthday.", "And also, if after college or university the OP has a chance to get a job abroad they should seriously consider this and break off all contact.", "Right?! Come on, if he's truly that violent and going through that many a year, then for goodness' sake, stop buying him fucking iPads! He doesn't need something that expensive. Just get him one of the kiddie Kindle Fires with the grippy/drop-proof cover.", "Given he uses his iPads for everything. It means they\u2019re the parents who shove it in his face to not parent him. So he probably throws tantrums and breaks them when he can regulate his emotions or stimulated breakouts", "Right. Grandparent of autistic 6 yo. She has had the same iPad for several years. Meltdown abuse of it included! Protective screen 30 bucks.", "Right?! My 6 year old autistic nephew is only on ipad 3 in 3 years. The first 2 are still back-ups. He literally gnaws on the protective cases and throws them during meltdowns. What is happening to these ipads?", "My autistic kid has the kindle fire with the protective case. That thing is indestructible. He's had it for a few years, no problem. (Knock on wood.) LoL.", "Exactly what I said. He needs a cheaper version. An android or Amazon tablet.", "Oh wow, that's not a thing here unless you're under 14.", "That's not always true. My parents have never had any involvement with my finances or bank accounts and I've been working since 15.", "Depends on how he breaks them I think. And insurance would certainly drop them off they have 8 claims a year to replace the one device...", "Insurance is for accidents.  Insuring something with the expectation of breaking it is fraud.\n\nWhat they need to do is get a used iPad and stick it in some rugged case that can\u2019t be taken off.  What kind of moron buys 8 iPads a year instead of doing something about it.", "FELLOW ADELAIDIAN!!! GDAY MATE!", "I paid I think $60\nFor my sons otterbox case he\u2019s very rough with his and it\u2019s never been a issue he\u2019s had it since last Christmas and even the case is still\nFine lol", "I think they probably mean insurance rather than warranty. Warranties generally only cover faults/defects. If they are iPads, Apple offer their own form of insurance called AppleCare+ which would drastically reduce the cost of replacing broken iPads. If OPs parents aren\u2019t getting some sort of insurance that covers physical damage, knowing their child has a tendency to break the iPads, then they\u2019re fools.", "The other person is correct that I meant insure. Honestly wasn\u2019t thinking of that really but I also mentioned a case because my brother threw my parents iPad against a wall as hard as he could when he was about the same age. We had just purchased her one of those like super heavy duty cases where you could drop it 3 stories and it would be fine.\n\nIt worked. Not a scratch. I think she might even still have the case now and it\u2019s been almost 10 years.", "Honestly, they're negligent parents because at the bare minimum they should be budgeting for this monthly. Even if they want to stick to the name brand stuff for whatever reason at the rate he's going through them this should be budgeted for- so their should have never have been a need to cancel OPs stuff, much less steal from OP.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. My four year old\u2019s Kindle Fire is indestructible!", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Given the treatment of OP, they clearly are crappy parents. But this is so true... i understand parents letting their kids having more screen time than necessary- sometimes you just need a break.\n\nBut an autistic kid doesn't \"need\" an ipad - it is no more a want than a birthday party. Not to mention, its a want enforced by the parents.\n\nIpads are relatively new to daily life, autism has existed for a loong time. These parents are just ignoring the fact that their child needs special care and attention. That money should be spent providing that care to the child to eventually improve his life and social aspects of it. Autism doesn't mean youre dead to the world - it means you have a harder start at life.", "Or he is using it to communicate, and help regulate his emotions?", "Could be stomping on it if he gets frustrated at not being understood even with his communication device. Or losing it. But at the cost of 7-8 a year, the parents should stretch and get a good Otter or other strong case.", "Well parents can be co-signers or something of that for their minor kids accounts. Or open a second account under their name and add their kids as users. And because they\u2019re minors they usually need parental consent for their own accounts at certain banks", "Most parents wouldn't actively take \"shared\" funds unless it was either for you or for some giant emergency, and they'd probably plan to replace those funds. Using your kid's money to provide for your kid is a different situation than using your kid's money to buy your other kid an iPad. (i.e. it is a problem if you can't afford heat or food for your kid without taking their money for the family, but heat or food would be a good explanation)", "I had to fight the bank tooth and nail with my oldest. I insisted that he was working, the money was his, and I had no need to control it. Really had to fight to get him the ATM card. When they saw me coming with sons 2 and 3, they just opened their accounts.", "What bank let you open an account without them as a minor?", "No, it\u2019s not just that simple. Some tablets will not meet everyone\u2019s needs and with autism you sometimes need to keep the same interface that they are used to so that it\u2019s still a functional device for them. \n\nNow, they could be purchasing used or refurbished to cut costs and get some better iPad covers to avoid damage.", "I mean, I gave up on cases because I break the otterboxes. \n\nThe difference is that my clumsy ass doesn't spend $300+ on my phones. It's genuinley cheaper to buy new phones than it is for me to go through screen protector after screen protector after screen protector and case after case- I think the most I've ever spent was $79 and that was because walmart was out of the cheaper phones and mine was bricked.", "Again, would insurance over damage that was deliberately caused by an authorized user?\n\nWould it do so every 45 days? Especially when the damage is so severe the device has to be replaced (versus repaired) every time?", "What insurance company is going insure that?", "it wasnt there money.. its like stealing from the neighbors because you have an autistic child... its fine that they use THERE money.. but its not ok that they steal someone ELSES money", "They're never going to make OP a priority because they're spending between $300-$800 every month and a half to replace his IPAD. (That's $2261 a year on the low end and $6392 on the higher end- all before tax and shipping)\n\nIf he needs a communication device that badly they can buy a cheap tablet. Their are clone apps for everything. Theirs no point in spending that much money on an IPAD when they can spend $100> on a generic tablet and buy a cheap skin to make it look like one to throw on.\n\nAlso, if they're replacing it 7-8 time's a year because he's damaging it in ways that void warranties for repair or make it irreparable he's actually being super destructive and violent- those things are tough enough to survive being dropped down a elevator shaft with only minor repairs- and they're doing him a disservice by not looking into alternative housing. At ten he's big enough to do serious harm to himself and other's while having a meltdown- and the police aren't going to know or care about him being autistic when paramedics call to have him removed so they can safely tend whoever he put through a wall or threw something at. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: Am low 2, high 3 ASD. This kid sounds like a mid to low 3- and they're absolutely doing him a disservice.", "Agreed", "Can't agree with you more here, my son is 3, autistic and can be prone to tantrums where his tablet gets a beating. He was going through the cheap ones fast. We got him an Amazon kids tablet with a kids case and it has 2 years no quibble warranty no matter what he does to it. He's had it months and its like he's never thrown it or slammed it against the wall! It's been drowned in milk, stood on, you name it!  Best \u00a3120 we ever spent!", "Bot, partial comment stolen from u/hydrangeafrog", "This is right on the money. I do Behavioral Therapy for Autistic kids as my career. iPads can be a potent tool and AAC communication device, but unregulated and unstructured iPad access is a horrible problem. Kids who stim with YouTube videos or music can become completely psychologically dependent on tablet computers.

They're basically replacing the Ipads once every 45 days- when will they ever have the money to make it up to OP?", "How they feel after what they did does not matter because it already happened. When it comes to birthdays, especially ones leading up to 18, you can't get those back no matter if they say sorry or give the money back eventually.\n\nit is about Op's money and it's also about the fact that Op was unable to pay for what they wanted to do for their birthday. \n\nWhen it comes to siblings with complex disabilities yeah, the priority does get switched at inappropriate times but that doesn't mean as a parent you go behind your teenage child's back, steal their money and then make them feel shit about it because they're mad even though you admitted you didn't tell them because you knew they would say no since the money was for their birthday.", "So if I give you $100 as a gift and then later promise to, say, order something you need if you hand it over it's going to be no big deal if I, say, spend it on my cats vet bills?
