You\u2019re more worried about your child being outed as a bully on social than his actions. Basically he FAFO\u2019d. The other parent did agree to remove identifying information, which is what your wife requested. Discipline your kid.", "I dont think what she did was wrong.  Shame sucks doesnt it?  This is a far better lesson to both you and your kid than you could have ever imagined.  If your son can publicly make fun and bully another kid, then its fair comeuppance for your kid to be publicly identified.\n\nYou are more worried with the shame you experienced than what your kid did.  The mother even agreed to remove the tagging information but leave the post.  You were treated fairly and appropriately.  YTA", "YTA. Parent your child better or be ready for the consequences he'll face when karma comes around.", "*soft* YTA- in the same way you don't trust that this person removed your child's identifying details, they likely don't trust that you will adequately handle this with your child. If your child is a bully to their kid, it's totally reasonable for this person to believe with what little information they have that you or your wife may be (at minimum) disrespectful to them as well.\n\nIt sounds like that isn't the case and you're trying to better understand the situation, and it's completely valid to be upset about someone rejecting your attempts at repair/deeper understanding. That person just doesn't owe you that opportunity though.\n\nIt's totally reasonable that they brought it to the school to handle and it sounds like you've been blocked on social media to prevent this from being handled outside of any school mediation. The school can absolutely convey your request for identifying details to be removed from the post & back you up on that!\n\nPutting myself in their shoes, I would hope that your energy would be directed at your own child rather than my child or me.", "YTA - I have to say if your son is willing to bully someone online then he can be called out for bullying someone online. And she's right about her PSA, parent's should be watching more of what their kid's are posting on social media if they are going to allow them to be on social media.", "Retaliatory bullying by an adult is not a solution to bullying. ESH.", "YTA, you\u2019re more upset by how she handles it than by what your son did.  And she was absolutely appropriate in how she handled it.  \n\nIf your son can dish out public humiliation online, then he can absolutely handle receiving it.  \n\nShe was also right with her comments about how he has been parented too.  You absolutely SHOULD be monitoring what your son puts out on social media, both to prevent bullying like this and to protect him from predators.  And where did he get the idea that fat shaming ANYONE is ok?  I\u2019m guessing he got that at home.", "I feel like you should be a lot more concerned about the kind of person your kid is growing up to be, rather than whether the mother of the kid he bullied accepts your friend request on Facebook. What your son did is disgusting, and absolutely reflects on you as a parent. YTA", "YTA.  What, you wanted her to keep silent about your bully son bullying her child so you could just sweep it under the rug and have no consequences?  And she does know something about your parenting...the product of it.", "ESH - at best. Because there are better ways to handle this you are correct on that. She essentially decided to bully your kid back publicly. Right or wrong for it she messed up with that. It is inappropriate.\n\nYou're a mild asshole just because this kid you're raising is becoming a bully. This may be your first notice, but definitely need to figure out why your kid needs to put down others to feel better about themselves. Kids who bully generally are just imitating the way their parents act privately. Not always but usually.", "I'm going with YTA.\n\nBut for the actions of **your child**, the post of the other parent wouldn't even exist.

Your wife apologized but have you?

Obviously as a parent of a child who has done wrong and had it aired publicly you feel shamed and upset. I don\u2019t blame the mother for posting and I don\u2019t believe she was wrong in doing so. The feelings you have about her post are probably similar to the feelings she has about your son\u2019s post.

Make sure your child knows how embarrassed you are.", "Personally, had her husband who is your son's coach addressed this with your son, it would have been unprofessional.\n\nHow else was she supposed to protect her child?\nYou hate the entire conversation when she tries to protect her child and respond to bullies who may try this as a warning sign.\n\nSure it hurts your son, but no offence, most people are going to question your upbringing if he is being carelessly callous towards others. How else is she supposed to address it to prevent it from occurring in the future? You do realise that depression and lack of confidence is something that is the least problematic result of bullying. It could also end up being an unaliving motivator and what would be the severity of your son's responsibility then.\n\nI know you probably see this as her trying to bully your child and your family but honestly, this is accountability for his actions. Play stupid games and win stupid prizes in the process. She removed his name is the most you can expect from her because at this present moment, she is responsible for her child and owes her child not yours. \n\nYou should rather try to make it an experience which makes your son realise the gravity of his actions. For others as well as himself. Sure you might punish him but he needs a talking to, so that he understands where he went wrong and how badly it could have been for the child he was bullying and how this incident is going to affect his future. He needs to own up to his actions and apologize profusely. Probably then , the mother might be more forgiving. But right now it feels as if you realise your son's wrongdoing only with respect to his future.\n\nObviously you have the right to protect your son and you are rightfully pissed but there's that feeling on her side as well.", "YTA your worried about your image and your kids image when he is straight up a bully. How would you feel being the kid called \u201cthe biggest eater\u201d with your body and picture being roasted online? Your worried about the wrong thing, how about you talk to your child about ruining other peoples lives and dish out some due discipline. \n\nThe problem is your son and probably his friends, not the post. This lady is protecting her child which is what you are trying to do, except your son doesn\u2019t need protection, other kids need protection from him.", "Good for this mother.

I\u2019ve had my kids bullied and my experience every single time is that the parents of bullies don\u2019t really give a fuck. It\u2019s almost as if the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.

Please don\u2019t miss this opportunity.", "NTA\n\nPosting someone's identifying info AND asking other people to tag them (or their parents) is an attempt to solicit a bandwagon response.  If this was another adult, I would be fine with that given the post this is in response to.  But as this is an adult calling out a child, it's wholly and entirely inappropriate.  If she really wanted to have a conversation with you like she claims in the post, she easily could have.  She chose not to and chose to go through the school instead, which is equally appropriate.  Had she not made the post, that would have been a perfectly valid response.  But she crossed the line when she made a post with identifying info of a child asking other adults to jump on you (and possibly your son) in the comments.  That was not an appropriate way to handle the situation, and you're right to have feelings about that.  \n\nThat being said, I think it's clear this post was a mistake made during a time of understandably high emotion.  She corrected her mistake when asked, and then proceeded to handle the situation in a more appropriate manner.  At this point, there's nothing else she can do, and I do agree with leaving the post (without identifying info) up because she's right: other parents need to know about what is being shared on social media when it reaches this level because there's a good chance they will want to talk to their own kids about it.  \n\nObviously, she's not required to be connected to you on social media, and it's perfectly understandable why she would not want that connection and why she would take steps to stop you from being able to see her account and her posts.", "YTA. Your kid blatantly bullied her child (has probably done it many times and to others). That is all she needs to know about your parenting. Quit bitching about how this was handled and fix your kid. This is a you problem, your parenting and your child\u2026all comes back to you.", "Sometimes there\u2019s no consequence like public shame. And yes your kid can catch those hands too sorry. I know a lot of suicidal kids who quietly get bullied like this wish their parents came to their radical and unapologetic defense. Good for mom. \n\nYTA. I hope mom blurred her son\u2019s face and body in the post though. That\u2019s my only concern. The boy doesn\u2019t need that hateful meme spreading even more.", "YTA your son fucked around and found out. These parents aren\u2019t bullying your son.

What more do you want them to do?", "NTA\n\nThere is a reason minors who commit crimes don't have their names plastered in the paper. I get that the mother was upset but typically the appropriate time to blast stuff on social media is when you attempt to handle the problem offline (with both you and with the school) and get nowhere. She escalated before attempting to solve the problem in a reasonable way.\n\nYou've posted nothing about what your kid is normally like, what lead up to this, what else is going on, how you intend to discipline your kid, etc. So I can't really judge you at all for the thing you already are calling your kid an AH for. I just don't have enough to go on for any of that.\n\nAs to her, if she left the following up\n\n> This is a PSA to all parents. Actually parent your kids and pay the hell attention to what are doing especially on social media. My son doesn't have it and yet somehow he's getting bullied on there and in school almost EVERY DAY. \n\nI'm going to say she realized she was wrong and backed down. If, however, your son's post is still on her feed and there are comments identifying your son as the bully.... then grown ass adults are just gossipping about a middle schooler on social media... which is BS. \n\nI'm sure some people here will say that your kid getting taken to task on social media is karmic justice, and they won't be wrong, but at the same time..... isn't adults playing tit for tat a lot like hitting your kid to teach them that hitting is wrong?", "Yta put this energy into your parenting instead of this woman. I wouldn\u2019t be critical of how parents call out my dad parenting.", "NTA although she did recognize her wrongdoing and modified the post which was really insightful and mature. I get being upset but I'm not sure what else she can do here to remedy the situation.\n\nHowever yeah posting a minor's info online is stupid and dangerous. She should have left it as a general anti-bully post and reach out to you individually", "NTA. You have every right to be bothered by that response.  If it were me personally, I would do proactive outreach to the school right now to make them aware that your son in in huge trouble with you for this bullying incident but you would also like to make the school aware that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok for a parent to single out your child online like that - especially given the fact that, as you pointed out, this parent had other ways to get in touch with you.  If the mom wants to help send \u201ca message to everyone\u201d, there are far more effective and mature, non emotional ways to do it. The post needs to come down. \n\nThat being said, I can also imagine how angry I would be if my son was bullied in that way.  Your son crossed a line by a mile and as a parent of the bullied child I would be VERY angry at your son.  In my state of anger I may even think something like \u201cwho the heck raised the type of kid who would do something like this?\u201d.  I\u2019m not saying this to make you feel bad, just to say that maybe you can cut that mom some slack because she is likely not in a very rational state of mind on this issue.", "Yta.

He should be called out everywhere. He should be ostracized. He should get his ass kicked, as that's about the only way bullies ever learn. You need to make sure he becomes a better person, or else you're just adding one more asshole to the world", "NTA. Kids are going to make fun of each other. How you respond sounds perfectly appropriate. Do you not need to be friends with that person on social media. You contacted them. They removed the part that exposed your child to a wider audience. Be done with it. Punish your kid and let it go", "The irony of your bullying child getting blasted on social media is the most poetic of justices. I'd worry more about getting your kid straightened out than feeling slighted on socials.\n\nYTA", "ETA, generally the way to treat bullying isn\u2019t to bully back. Posting it with the kids information to begin with was silly. The kids are in 8th grade, holding them to an adult standard is going to go poorly. However, holding your child accountable is the job of a parent, which you now say you\u2019ll be doing. So how is she going to explain how it\u2019s the right thing to do as an adult to bully an 8th grader.  \n\nIf the argument is eye for an eye, you\u2019ll eventually go blind.", "To add a different point of view. If her son now gets additional bullying in school from other children because their mother decided it was best to take this sort of thing to the internet who\u2019s to blame then?? I\u2019m not that far removed from my teenage years, so I remember these sorts of things well. I can\u2019t say that OP is a good or a bad parent, I don\u2019t know them personally but to assume it\u2019s \u201clearned behavior\u201d is silly. While in some cases that might be true kids that age (12-13) are very impressionable particularly by their peers. The question OP is asking is if the mother of the child is in the wrong for blasting a 13 year old kid online. Not if their child is in the wrong or not.", "NTA. Your job is to defend your kid from negative life-changing events, even if they are TA.\n\nThis woman should have reached out to you first. She is also TA.

And I hope you give your child hell for that it is absolutely disgraceful behavior.", "NTA\u2026kids do dumb shit all the time, I was bullied as a child and probably could have been considered a bully as a teen. Her complaint is that someone posted online bullying her son so her being a mature adult turned around and did the same thing. Your son is certainly not innocent but there\u2019s no reason to blast anyone one the internet and she would have been an adult and handled the situation maturely. Again I\u2019m not defending the act of bullying but for a grown ass adult to then do that to a child seems a bit inappropriate especially considering you have a relationship with the parents. All she did was add to the bullying cycle.", "YTA. \n\nLet your kid be called out like your kid called hers out. How does it feel? Embarrassed? I bet the kid being fat shamed was, too.", "YTA. \n\nYour kid is a bully. You lose any and all moral high ground.

Fuck around and find out", "NAH - As far as I can tell, everything has gone the way it should. You had a knee jerk reaction to seeing her post and got upset. But instead of going on a tirade you guys reached out to the mother directly. And you must have done it in a nice enough way to where she felt safe offering the very well-written response that she did. Presumably she changed her post, and is following up through proper channels. **And** **presumably**, you're going to leave her alone and let this matter get handled, and discipline your child for what he did.\n\nI don't think its right to police your feelings on the matter. I think as a parent I would be more mortified that my child did this than upset he was called out publicly. But feeling upset that he was outed publicly is a normal feeling I think.

Cyber bullying is huge. And it hurts children who aren\u2019t at the age to understand that as time passes, the bullying will usually calm down. If my children were being bullied I\u2019d make it public, too. And I have. Because I\u2019ll be damned if one of my children are hurting because of some kid who wants to be an asshole to them.

I\u2019d want others to know that bullying is happening and it\u2019s not okay. Because someday, it could go too far or the bullied child doesn\u2019t have the emotional capability yet to deal with it and they commit suicide.

Wondering if it was another kid who said fuck you to your kid for bullying another kid, would you be upset about how they handled it? Also, being in sports or in the honor roll, doesn't make you a good person. Bullying usually comes from people who feel they are superior to others.", "Should she have contacted you directly? In my opinion yes. But also her precious son was just horrifically bullied by your son. Kids have literally committed suicide from this. And you don't know if it's the first time because you weren't monitoring his social media. Other kids being bullied by your son may not tell their parents, and just suffer in silence. Your son is too young to have sm that is not monitored like that. You dropped the ball. Again, I don't think she should have publicly called him out, but I can understand in the heat of the moment she would be mad. Once your wife contacted her she agreed to remove it. That is where you should get over it. It was resolved. She is right to keep the post up though. Parents need to know what is happening online so they can ensure their kids aren't being bullied or being bullied. \nI saw that you said you took his phone away but if my son did this I would also be digging deep with him to figure out why he would want to hurt someone so badly in such a public way. And of course he should apologize to the boy, which I did not see you mention. \nAs to becoming her Facebook friend - your son, who you raised, is bullying her son.

For what? Highlighting your kids actions as harmful? Trying to locate the parents of the kid bullying her child, so they can actually parent? Are you mad because of his information being public? What about her kid, who has been ridiculed and mocked on a public forum by your kid?\n\nShe said nothing disparaging outside of the fact you need to be more aware of social media and your kid's actions, which are correct. Work through your emotions and realize you are 100% responsible until your kid is an adult. YTA", "YTA\n\nI feel for you. However I do get the sense that you\u2019re far more concerned about the impact on your child than by the fact that this kid has been getting bullied both at school and on line every day for what one assumes is quite some time. And it appears that your kid is at least one of the ringleaders given what he posted was carefully thought out and executed. This wasn\u2019t a spur of the moment act. \n\nAs parents, navigating this new world of social media is incredibly challenging. Have you spoken BEFORE this with your kid? Have you discussed what it means to post something? That something posted, texted, emailed, whatever is out there FOREVER. That you shouldn\u2019t post something unless you\u2019re ready for it to posted and reposted again and again? That once its out there - you have lost control of it. Have you discussed bullying behavior to include online  bullying? Do you do any checks of your kids social media? \n\nThis is going to be harsh - but if you haven\u2019t than yes, you\u2019re behind the power curve as a parent.\n\nMy kids are in Scouts but a lot of organizations have anti-bullying campaigns. We talk to our kids about all the different means of bullying, they have to teach their fellow scouts about it. Cyber bullying, drawing up a contract, etc.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do anything that regimented but a recurring discussion about social media AND bullying is crucial.\n\nI think YTA for \u201cMy son very much appears to be the asshole here. I doubt very much that he is going to be able to defend this and will receive the appropriate hell.\u201d It still sounds like you\u2019re making excuses here - that maybe just maybe this is all some kind of mistake? That your kid really didn\u2019t drag another child on social media about their weight. Reading your other post, in fact there IS no doubt your son did it. But the way you caveat it in your write up is in such a way as you\u2019re trying to downgrade it. \n\nWhat would YOU have done, OP if this was all reversed? \n\nAs hard as this is, this may prove helpful for both boys. \n\nAnd yes, the PSA the other mom posted is tough. Would. You rather this continue unabated and her son try and self harm. Would that PSA be better? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nI can\u2019t fathom why you feel entitled to her adding you as a \u201cfriend\u201d to her FB account so you can review and grade her post? Seriously?

These other adults are now calling him names here are the AH? Why not handle this with the school or other parents to begin with as you all know each other? It may have been different if all other avenues had been tried first but this is the first reaction and not cool!

The son's actions are just not the point of this post because the OP isn't denying the son was in the wrong.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable to not want the shitty actions of your teenager posted online to an even wider audience. That kind of thing can have long term, detrimental effects even if the teenager matures and becomes a better person.\n\nI'd also be curious if the victim really wants his mom sharing a mean post about him to friends, family and whomever else follows her.", "Thanks. I get your point of view. To clarify your concerns, he has lost his phone indefinitely already. There was never a question about his actions.

And I think it is totally okay for there to be differing opinions on that.", "There's a difference between a child acting inappropriately and an adult acting inappropriately. Bullied kids mother was upset about public shaming, then turned around and did the same thing to the bully. She should have led by example and addressed the wrongdoing in a mature, respectful way. Instead, she displayed the same lack of emotional intelligence as the bully she was calling out. Kids are growing up, learning, and maturing whereas adults should know better.

It turns out that the incident the OP was responding to was in fact a response to the long term bullying of the other child by her daughter. The whole thing completely blew up in the OP's face.\n\nFirst you get the truth and that means giving the accused the to respond, then if the response is inadequate, sure go ahead with the public shaming.\n\nAs a teacher I am so very tired of reactive parents who respond before they have the faintest idea of what actually happened. They blow up at the teacher. They get the facts. They are 100% wrong. They back down. I have never had an apology from this sort of parent. And then the relationship between the parent and teacher is permanently damaged.\n\nAs a first step, this was a terrible idea.", "I get why this keeps getting said. I made the post about the other parent's actions, not my own kid's actions. To be clear though, I am much, much more concerned about his actions. It is just that they are cut and dry. He did a terrible thing and needs to be taught otherwise. There is no point in making a post about that. Who would disagree with the notion that the bully is bad?\n\nI thought the other parents' actions were more subjective, however, and it does seem to have played out that way. There is a lot of variance in the replies.", "Thanks! I get that point of view completely.

It is interesting to see all the different opinions for sure.", "Thanks. I think everything you have said is pretty right. The only very minor quibble I have is this: She put out what was basically a public blast that she wanted to get into contact with us to talk about it. I just would expect someone to accept a friend request at that point because Facebook can do a pretty good job of hiding messages from non-friends, but that is a minor thing.", "Yeah, I thought people might feel this way for sure.

And of course you are right on social media.", "Yes she is an adult and far better ways to deal than doxing a child as a first response. She should know better. Also I see no mention of a history of the child's behavior so it seems a one off. There are better ways to teach children right from wrong for one mistake. If this had been an ongoing issue that had not been resolved first in adult responsible manor the post still could have been made without doxing the child.  All these people that have been victims of bullying here are willing to go after a young child in a most disgusting manor for one mistake are really sad and cruel.

I am not sure why we would share that.\n\nOf course we bear responsibility for what our son does and posts. No questions there. \n\nAs for the fat shaming, I don't even know how to answer that.

I will try to answer your questions, but I don't have a lot to give you.\n\nYes, he started it. No question there.

I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s exactly like hitting your kid to teach them that hitting is wrong, although I understand the concern about putting minors on social media. The teenager publicly mocked the other boy on social media for something he may have no control over, but the mother publicly called out the teenager for something he chose to do. Not exactly the same as the hitting analogy. I think the father should focus more on the fact that his son has been using social media to bully others, instead of worrying as much about the other mother\u2019s posts, you have a much bigger problem on your hands.

I also agree that in general by job is to protect my kid which pushed me to the impulse to feel upset that she named him directly in a public post.

And I get it. \n\nBut we don't know what went through her mind when she did that so, while she should have contacted the school etc, she, heavily charged with emotions of concern for her son used the internet. \n\nThis is a parallel for the bullying. However, it is a very complicated place to be for both of you, so I can't understand if I blame her completely. \n\nObviously she blamed your parenting and obviously you might have been a great parent but he picked it up online or from his peers but parents are unfortunately always blamed. \n\nPlease don't punish him in a cruel and blind fashion. He just needs to understand and he will, coming from you.\n\nI am sorry for being harsh. But some people are expecting the coach to educate the kid 24*7 would have been a worse decision for both the kids. Additionally, it is better coming from parents. At least what I feel from an adult who was a teen until recently.\n\nETA - I don't exactly believe she was completely or even partially wrong. Should she have tried other options? Yes? Was the decision something I wouldn't take? Not exactly. If my son was bullied, I would have reacted that way as well. Her priority is to safeguard her son. \n\nYou are admitting to your mistakes and that makes you a good parent. But you need to carry through your threats of punishments instead of arguing with strangers who will think of it as defensiveness and you only know the truth of it. But it isn't a positive light now, is it?", "I have tried to frame this as best as I can. \n\nA teacher is responsible for treating his pupils with respect and equality. And is responsible for teaching them responsibility etc etc. However one of the pupil is antagonising his son. Interference might lead to further resistance from the bully who would continue to bully him without the presence of any witness.\n\nTeens aren't receptive and in this case, the parent himself wanted more work from a distressed mother to go through old contacts and Facebook pages and wait for the OP to respond while their son suffered mentally.\n\nI hate abuse and the use of the internet in achieving vigilant justice but his son, if isn't less than 10 has a basic understanding of what is hurtful. There has to be a reason why OP is protesting so much for his own son. To save his son from online prosecution. Yes, he is a child so he shouldn't be prosecuted but he deserved to be called out. Even if it was public. She couldn't have waited for her son to take a drastic step so she called out. Bullying is not a minor crime. The amount of cruelty you need to possess to demean, publicly another person or child, needs to be corrected ASAP. No offence, ignoring or making light of the situation will worsen his behaviour in the future. Sure it was vigilant, don't know if it practically correct but she needed to protect her child. Was she supposed to wait for the child's death until the OP responded? \n\nShe even removed his name later on and only used it to connect to the parents of her child's bully. Let us face it, we don't know what happened before it lead to her blasting his son on the internet. So instead of blaming them and victimising a bully, the op should get over it and address his son instead of blindly punishing him. I am not even asking for a blind punishment. Talk to his son. Send to therapy. Etc to enable better emapthetic approach to his peers.\n\nHowever, expecting teachers to perform major legwork and absolving parents of all the blame is positively blind. I get that you hate vigilant online justice but in a situation where teachers are overworked and underpaid, do they really have to monitor their students 24*7 when parents can't do that.\n\nI hate teachers who are blind and don't do anything for their students when needed but I also hate people who only want teachers to do everything. They can't teach kids morals. Moral values are incorporated in early stages of life. Not when the child is old enough to have a coach. Not saying he can't improve but it is above the skill and pay grade of a school baseball coach. \n \nHe requires parenting and therapy.\n\nIn this case, I didn't call him YTA or NTA. I am just saying that he needs to stop blaming his son's victim and talk to his son before something worse happens.\n\nBullying isn't a minor thing. It has an effect on the child who is being bullied. He will carry the emotional garbage forever. Is that justified?", "You\u2019re right, your son being punched would be far too severe.

But that's just me.", "If you are saying by not taking it lightly = losing phone privileges, i can't say i agree. But hey, I'm not the guy raiaing the bully.", "Yeah, as OP I am on board with everything you are saying. I think I might have overexplained and messed up the question I meant to ask though. My kid is the asshole between the kids. Obviously we bear responsibility for what our kid does too.\n\nMy question was whether or not her method of dealing with it by naming a kid on a public forum was appropriate. If her kid had struck my kid, to use your hitting example, I would think posting about it on social media and calling him out by name was inappropriate. But I also wondered if others would agree, hence the post.", "> you have a much bigger problem on your hands\n\nThat I 100% agree with. But we don't know that they aren't. It's just that dealing with his kid is not the advice he asked for, so it's not the advice I dispensed. I hope that they consider the bullying to be the more important problem. Their son is only \"theirs\" until he's 18. They have 6 years to fix him being an asshole. This is quite urgent. It's just not the matter I was asked to weigh in on.\n\n>the mother publicly called out the teenager for something he chose to do\n\nShould we normalize that? When you were a kid if you were being bullied did your Mom stand outside the school with a bullhorn calling out your bullies and what they did? How is that productive? I can guarantee you the victim is mortfiied by his Mom's behavior.\n\n> There is really nothing that could \u201clead up to this\u201d that would justify publicly mocking someone\u2019s weight. \n\nI never said anything about justifying the **SON'S** behavior. What I said is that I couldn't judge the **PARENTS** without knowing what's lead up to their son behaving that way. I can sure judge the son, but again... I wasn't asked to. His Dad called him an AH, right?", "I say it\u2019s a good lesson for him on posting publicly online. What you post on social media becomes open to the public, many people have learned this the hard way. Any social media post can come back to haunt you even years later.

I mean, if you asked for advice on how to deal with your kid, that'd be a different story, yanno?\n\nMore people in this world have been bullied, myself included, than were bullies. I think a lot of people are taking what your kid did personally and it's skewing them into reacting to that... instead of what you actually asked.", "Its not even an eye for an eye.

As my kids have made clear to me again and again - nobody is on FB but old farts like parents. Kids that age are not on FB. Neither one of my kids (15 and 18) even have FB accounts.

They care.", "[deleted]", "The other parents are going to be reaching out to the school. They're going after you and your son in every way possible.\n\nAlso, your son deserves to be punished.

Since dealing with the son is not the subject that OP asked for advice on, we know nothing about how the OP feels about it... aside from the fact that he called his son an AH.\n\n> that as parents it\u2019s their job to monitor their sons online behaviour, which is true\n\nI agree with you on this part. It was the only part of your post I agreed with. I can find no flaw here. \n\nThey definitely dropped the ball at monitoring his online activity. First off, my 11 year old has no social media of **ANY** **KIND** because I don't think it's appropriate. Second, if she did have social media, stuff she's posting out to the world, I'd get to see it.\n\n> That their son had to learn that fat shaming is ok somewhere and likely learned it at home. This one you have tiny bit of a point on, but it\u2019s still not a guess. It\u2019s a logical conclusion.\n\nIt's a possible conclusion, but it's also equally possible that he's hanging out with a charming group of 12 year assholes and got it from them. It's quite clear from the upset Mother's post that this kid is not her kid's only bully. I think there is likely a whole group of kids teasing this kid for being fat and that this post is only the tip of the iceberg.", "The first reaction for the parent to call the bully out on Social media was not the right thing to do. They should have called you the parent and have a talk. If you had not took action to correct your sons behavior then maybe post something.

If you look deep down in your memories, I'm certain that you can find warnings of your child that have been visible for years. No child wakes up one day and is suddenly a bully. It is learned and reinforced.\n\nIf you have any genuinely serious concern for this, you will massively alter your child's interactions with others. You need to determine what friends are around.

While your kid's actions were terrible, because what they were doing was cyber-bullying. The parent's response was to, wait for it,...\n\n**Engage in cyber-bullying.**\n\nThe whole reason cyber-bullying is problematic, at least in the specific way your kid went about it, is that it isolates a target's insecurities and slams them on-line; which then both affects that person individually, and motivates other personalities on-line to brigade the target. The negative consequences of that can include things as minor as feeling a little bad, to as severe as suicide.\n\nWhile you're kid's actions were terrible, and they should be held accountable for it and taught why it's a problem and how to change their behavior; and no matter how justified that other parent might have felt in doing what they did, the fact is that the same consequences that could have been imposed on the other kid; could be imposed on yours as well.\n\nIt doesn't matter if your kid was \"wrong,\" or if the response was \"just,\" this was absolutely 100% not the way to handle it. Imposing those risks on a child because you're pissed off is vindictive and harmful.

She should have contacted you directly (perhaps in addition to taking other measures like going to the school or venting online) so that you could have the opportunity to address your kid.

It also makes it very difficult to respond to OP'S child behavior in an appropriate way that will make him move forward as a better person because they will be too busy trying to protect him from the online fall out.

It's \\*REALLY\\* fucking easy to just say \"Parent your kid\" or \"Discipline your kid\", but I acted out all the time in school, and my parents got hauled in to get dressed down by the principal about my behavior, and they were good parents who did everything they could.

The parent should take reasonable steps to address the issue and let other adult figures know before they make some public shame posts including a child. \n\nThe parent and the other adult figures (other parents and school) also need to take steps to figure out what actually occurred before engaging in public shaming posts. There is often much more to any situation than initially meets the eye and these situations don\u2019t occur in a vacuum.

It\u2019s not uncommon for kids to both mutually engage in poor behavior and be victims of poor behavior as well. \n\nThere was a kid in my grade growing up who was overweight and he joked about it daily. He would joke about being a sumo wrestler and everyone laughed and joined in and we all thought he loved it because he is the one who started it and perpetuated it. Looking back, I think he was really insecure about his weight and took the approach that if he jokes about it first and laughs and is open about it, he won\u2019t live in fear of someone else using it to humiliate him. I think he was actually hurt by the joking even though he started it and normalized it.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that this is what is happening here but I am saying that kids are weird and that we don\u2019t actually know what is happening here.

If this mom wants to hide this behavior, she will hide worse behavior too. I hope everyone knows the truth about these people now. The best medicine for a bully, and the parents who cover for them, is to be outted to the world and shamed. Might be the only thing that stops this cycle.

It can, but not always. \n\nAlso, don't think because you were bullied that it is okay to dehumanize people like you did here by calling OP's child 'it.'

And I\u2019ve said this in another comment, the kid is only going to get bullied worse now that mommy came to his defense publicly online. An eye for an eye leaves the world blind. Be an adult and show the children the error of their ways, and punish accordingly. Instead she resorted to the same behavior she\u2019s mad about in the first place.

I was once a middle schooler and yes, there were bullies, but the significant majority of kids were not.  My have two kids and one is still in middle school and haven't witnessed nor heard from other kids or parents of bullying.

Based on the effort put into this incident by Op\u2019s kid, it\u2019s probably not the first time in his life he\u2019s been a bully to someone he deemed beneath him.  Ok your taking corrective action after the fact, that\u2019s good, but people want to know what that is because, like I said probably not the first time son has done it, also probably not the first time Op has seen, or been told about his kid being a jerk.  If corrective action is crap, then Op is not really handling the situation.  Also I made another comment about what may happen if you are expecting help from school or police, with social media bullying.", "Honestly when parents do \"just raising awareness\" shite like this my strong suspicion is that it's become more about their ego than their kid's wellbeing.

Police also said there isn\u2019t anything they could do about it,  because no direct threats were made, and they hadn\u2019t actually done anything in real life.

Why didn\u2019t they take their bullying child and have him apologize to the victim? Kids who are bullied are very susceptible to suicidal ideation and even may commit suicide. That you would more concerned for the bully instead of the victim speaks volumes to me. OP has a very serious problem on her hands with this child. Making him accountable for his actions is paramount to his well being and socialization. \nLet me give you an example. My daughter was molested by the husband of a school friend. We were neighbors and he groomed her for several years. Our kids played together and I had no idea this was the case. I trusted my friend and mistakenly trusted her husband. Found out after the fact he had done this in a different town, she knew it and they moved as a result.\nI confided in another school friend, but she was more concerned about what it was doing to his wife than she was the horror that had happened to our daughter. My daughter, to this day has extreme anxiety, severe depression and other mental health issues. She has been in years of therapy, and monthlt psychiatric visits to medicate the resulting problems, ever since. She\u2019s 42yrs. This happened when she was sixteen. In our state sixteen is legal age for consensual sex so the hands of the police were tied. Even though they found this was his pattern, and it happened to subsequent girls, their hands were tied.\nBut oh my goodness, who care about that when the wife was hurt over the incident. \nYou have the cart before the horse here! \nPlease please rethink your argument.", ">and the mom apparently did have ways to contact OP without airing embarrassing stuff about her own child on social media.\n\nInteresting.

I went to the parents who we considered friends, the father's response was \"doesn't this make you wonder about your son\". Nothing about his son's actions. I went to the principal about it. My son ended up being called into the principal's office. Years later, there were other bullying problems. In all there years there was one, just one, teacher that cared and made a difference. In middle school, my son was repeatedly being stolen from (had to buy a new calculator every two weeks and the teacher punished my son when it went missing). Finally I went to that schools principal. A boy came forward with the third stolen calculator. He claimed my son \"leant\" it to him. The guidance councilor then called my son in and interrogated him until her \"remembered\" that he leant it to the kid. The boy was top football player and the teacher was the team coach. I asked my son if he did actually remember lending the calculator. His answer was \"no\". But that was the \"easy\" solution for the school obtain. Son is now 36.

I witnessed it firsthand and experienced it myself. \n\nYes, she reposted embarrassing things about her own child\u2014but the reality is that with teenagers, if something was posted to Snapchat, all of the kids already know about it. There is little, if any, harm in the mom reposting it to Facebook (a website that ~kids these days~ don\u2019t even use) as a PSA. It\u2019s not like she shared an embarrassing video of her kid or that she was posting her own hateful feelings about her child. Her Facebook friends who would know both children are likely parents of classmates (classmates who already saw the bullying snapchats directly, received screenshots, or at the very least have heard about it from their peers). I don\u2019t see harm in classmates\u2019 parents finding out about it\u2014it opens the door for conversations with their children about cyberbullying and bullying in general. The victim likely doesn\u2019t care that his classmates\u2019 parents know\u2014he cares about his peers knowing and about the fact that he\u2019s being bullied in the first place. \n\nMy experience as a former teen and as a non-parent adult who works closely with teenagers and their parents has been that parents frequently don\u2019t take bullying seriously unless their child is the victim. Sometimes this is because they suck as people; but in most cases, it\u2019s because it is hard to truly understand the impact of bullying on kids when we are so far removed from that age, and particularly when many parents of current teens were already adults when public cyberbullying became a thing (and even those who were teens in the age of social media bullying were witnessing and/or experiencing it on very different platforms from those that are popular today). Life is hard, everyone is busy, and it\u2019s easy to feel like one comment or post made by your kid is not a huge deal. In many cases, the only way to get parents to take their child\u2019s bullying seriously is to force their hand by going public. \n\nOP\u2019s post indicates that OP and their wife have yet to have a conversation with their child about the bullying. This makes me wonder if, had the mom reached out to them directly first, they would have taken her seriously and addressed the issue, or whether they would have told her they\u2019d talk to their kid and then put it off\u2014it is the holidays, after all\u2014or, whether they would have talked to their kid and trusted his word on the situation (which more often than not is goijg to downplay things or be a flat out lie, because kids don\u2019t like to get in trouble). Schools are often ineffective in putting a stop to bullying, but even in the best-case scenario, schools are almost always unable to put a stop to bullying before it has caused harm to the victim over a significant period of time.\n\nSure, the mon could have started by reaching out to OP and their wife, or the school, or both. But bullying causes significant harm and trauma that can impact a person for life, and this increases significantly the longer it goes on. Even stopping bullying after one incident is too late to prevent damage to the victim. It is in the child\u2019s best interest to get it to stop immediately. So even if mom had left social media as a last resort option, and OP and the school were both proactive and on top of it, it would have taken time to put an end to the bullying, and in that time, more and more damage would be done to her child.", "Those were already out there so using it creatively was good.
