It is a picture of her son from behind and is stylized like the ranking of a high school basketball or football recruit being ranked for college recruiting. It says five stars, has the ESPN logo, and calls him the \"#1 Eater in the Class of 2028.\"   \n\n\nMy son very much appears to be the asshole here. I doubt very much that he is going to be able to defend this and will receive the appropriate hell.  \n\n\nWith that said, am I crazy to think this was handled wildly inappropriately by the other boy's mother? Calling out a child on social media, even a guilty one, seems pretty nuts to me. On top of that, it is hard to read the post as anything else as a public critique of our parenting which she obviously knows nothing about. She also had other means of finding us. Her husband has coached our son in baseball and they go to school together.   \n\n\nMy wife contacted her apologizing and asking her to remove the identifying details of the post. To other child's mother's credit, she gave a long and reasonable response that I will again type out.  \n\n\n\"Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate it.

However I am leaving the post as a message to everyone that people just need to be more aware of what their kids are doing. We live in a cruel world and people need to know that kids and social media needs to be addressed.

You\u2019re more worried about your child being outed as a bully on social than his actions. Basically he FAFO\u2019d. The other parent did agree to remove identifying information, which is what your wife requested. Discipline your kid.", "I dont think what she did was wrong.  Shame sucks doesnt it?  This is a far better lesson to both you and your kid than you could have ever imagined.  If your son can publicly make fun and bully another kid, then its fair comeuppance for your kid to be publicly identified.\n\nYou are more worried with the shame you experienced than what your kid did.  The mother even agreed to remove the tagging information but leave the post.  You were treated fairly and appropriately.  YTA", "YTA. Parent your child better or be ready for the consequences he'll face when karma comes around.", "*soft* YTA- in the same way you don't trust that this person removed your child's identifying details, they likely don't trust that you will adequately handle this with your child. If your child is a bully to their kid, it's totally reasonable for this person to believe with what little information they have that you or your wife may be (at minimum) disrespectful to them as well.\n\nIt sounds like that isn't the case and you're trying to better understand the situation, and it's completely valid to be upset about someone rejecting your attempts at repair/deeper understanding. That person just doesn't owe you that opportunity though.\n\nIt's totally reasonable that they brought it to the school to handle and it sounds like you've been blocked on social media to prevent this from being handled outside of any school mediation. The school can absolutely convey your request for identifying details to be removed from the post & back you up on that!\n\nPutting myself in their shoes, I would hope that your energy would be directed at your own child rather than my child or me.", "YTA - I have to say if your son is willing to bully someone online then he can be called out for bullying someone online. And she's right about her PSA, parent's should be watching more of what their kid's are posting on social media if they are going to allow them to be on social media.", "Retaliatory bullying by an adult is not a solution to bullying. ESH.", "YTA, you\u2019re more upset by how she handles it than by what your son did.  And she was absolutely appropriate in how she handled it.  \n\nIf your son can dish out public humiliation online, then he can absolutely handle receiving it.  \n\nShe was also right with her comments about how he has been parented too.  You absolutely SHOULD be monitoring what your son puts out on social media, both to prevent bullying like this and to protect him from predators.  And where did he get the idea that fat shaming ANYONE is ok?  I\u2019m guessing he got that at home.", "I feel like you should be a lot more concerned about the kind of person your kid is growing up to be, rather than whether the mother of the kid he bullied accepts your friend request on Facebook. What your son did is disgusting, and absolutely reflects on you as a parent. YTA", "YTA.  What, you wanted her to keep silent about your bully son bullying her child so you could just sweep it under the rug and have no consequences?  And she does know something about your parenting...the product of it.", "ESH - at best. Because there are better ways to handle this you are correct on that. She essentially decided to bully your kid back publicly. Right or wrong for it she messed up with that. It is inappropriate.\n\nYou're a mild asshole just because this kid you're raising is becoming a bully. This may be your first notice, but definitely need to figure out why your kid needs to put down others to feel better about themselves. Kids who bully generally are just imitating the way their parents act privately. Not always but usually.", "I'm going with YTA.\n\nBut for the actions of **your child**, the post of the other parent wouldn't even exist.  Once your child posted his mean post, do you even know what happened?  Did other kids pile-on to the victim?  Do you know how the other child is coping?  Have you even asked?  Your wife apologized but have you?  Has your son?  \n\nYour child is not the victim here and of course you are concerned for him but actions have consequences and it's his time to learn.", "I hope your child learned his lesson lol seems like karma to me", "I wouldn\u2019t say anyone is the AH. Obviously as a parent of a child who has done wrong and had it aired publicly you feel shamed and upset. I don\u2019t blame the mother for posting and I don\u2019t believe she was wrong in doing so. The feelings you have about her post are probably similar to the feelings she has about your son\u2019s post. Definitely take a step back and figure out a way to ensure similar situations do not present themselves in the future. Make sure your child knows how embarrassed you are.", "Personally, had her husband who is your son's coach addressed this with your son, it would have been unprofessional.\n\nHow else was she supposed to protect her child?\nYou hate the entire conversation when she tries to protect her child and respond to bullies who may try this as a warning sign.\n\nSure it hurts your son, but no offence, most people are going to question your upbringing if he is being carelessly callous towards others. How else is she supposed to address it to prevent it from occurring in the future? You do realise that depression and lack of confidence is something that is the least problematic result of bullying. It could also end up being an unaliving motivator and what would be the severity of your son's responsibility then.\n\nI know you probably see this as her trying to bully your child and your family but honestly, this is accountability for his actions. Play stupid games and win stupid prizes in the process. She removed his name is the most you can expect from her because at this present moment, she is responsible for her child and owes her child not yours. \n\nYou should rather try to make it an experience which makes your son realise the gravity of his actions. For others as well as himself. Sure you might punish him but he needs a talking to, so that he understands where he went wrong and how badly it could have been for the child he was bullying and how this incident is going to affect his future. He needs to own up to his actions and apologize profusely. Probably then , the mother might be more forgiving. But right now it feels as if you realise your son's wrongdoing only with respect to his future.\n\nObviously you have the right to protect your son and you are rightfully pissed but there's that feeling on her side as well.", "YTA your worried about your image and your kids image when he is straight up a bully. How would you feel being the kid called \u201cthe biggest eater\u201d with your body and picture being roasted online? Your worried about the wrong thing, how about you talk to your child about ruining other peoples lives and dish out some due discipline. \n\nThe problem is your son and probably his friends, not the post. This lady is protecting her child which is what you are trying to do, except your son doesn\u2019t need protection, other kids need protection from him.", "Good for this mother.

This world is full of assholes, hopefully you teach your son not to be one.\n\nI wish you luck.", "It was a huge asshole move on the part of your kid AND to find out that kid\u2019s dad coached your kid makes me think your kid is even more of a disrespectful bully. I\u2019ve had my kids bullied and my experience every single time is that the parents of bullies don\u2019t really give a fuck. It\u2019s almost as if the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. You care less about how your kid treats people than you do about how you are perceived. The other mom was gracious in her response. She took your kid\u2019s name down. Deal.", ">I doubt very much that he is going to be able to defend this and will receive the appropriate hell.\n\nGood\n\nYTA", "ESH. Your kid is an AH. The mom outed a kid publicly. You seem to be more concerned about your rep than the bullied child. You still have time to turn your child around before he becomes an adult AH. Please don\u2019t miss this opportunity.", "NTA\n\nPosting someone's identifying info AND asking other people to tag them (or their parents) is an attempt to solicit a bandwagon response.  If this was another adult, I would be fine with that given the post this is in response to.  But as this is an adult calling out a child, it's wholly and entirely inappropriate.  If she really wanted to have a conversation with you like she claims in the post, she easily could have.  She chose not to and chose to go through the school instead, which is equally appropriate.  Had she not made the post, that would have been a perfectly valid response.  But she crossed the line when she made a post with identifying info of a child asking other adults to jump on you (and possibly your son) in the comments.  That was not an appropriate way to handle the situation, and you're right to have feelings about that.  \n\nThat being said, I think it's clear this post was a mistake made during a time of understandably high emotion.  She corrected her mistake when asked, and then proceeded to handle the situation in a more appropriate manner.  At this point, there's nothing else she can do, and I do agree with leaving the post (without identifying info) up because she's right: other parents need to know about what is being shared on social media when it reaches this level because there's a good chance they will want to talk to their own kids about it.  \n\nObviously, she's not required to be connected to you on social media, and it's perfectly understandable why she would not want that connection and why she would take steps to stop you from being able to see her account and her posts.", "YTA. Your kid blatantly bullied her child (has probably done it many times and to others). That is all she needs to know about your parenting. Quit bitching about how this was handled and fix your kid. This is a you problem, your parenting and your child\u2026all comes back to you.", "Sometimes there\u2019s no consequence like public shame. And yes your kid can catch those hands too sorry. I know a lot of suicidal kids who quietly get bullied like this wish their parents came to their radical and unapologetic defense. Good for mom. \n\nYTA. I hope mom blurred her son\u2019s face and body in the post though. That\u2019s my only concern. The boy doesn\u2019t need that hateful meme spreading even more.", "YTA your son fucked around and found out. These parents aren\u2019t bullying your son. They called him out for being a bully - which he is. Their response was very reasonable and they removed the identifying details about him. What more do you want them to do?", "NTA\n\nThere is a reason minors who commit crimes don't have their names plastered in the paper. I get that the mother was upset but typically the appropriate time to blast stuff on social media is when you attempt to handle the problem offline (with both you and with the school) and get nowhere. She escalated before attempting to solve the problem in a reasonable way.\n\nYou've posted nothing about what your kid is normally like, what lead up to this, what else is going on, how you intend to discipline your kid, etc. So I can't really judge you at all for the thing you already are calling your kid an AH for. I just don't have enough to go on for any of that.\n\nAs to her, if she left the following up\n\n> This is a PSA to all parents. Actually parent your kids and pay the hell attention to what are doing especially on social media. My son doesn't have it and yet somehow he's getting bullied on there and in school almost EVERY DAY. \n\nI'm going to say she realized she was wrong and backed down. If, however, your son's post is still on her feed and there are comments identifying your son as the bully.... then grown ass adults are just gossipping about a middle schooler on social media... which is BS. \n\nI'm sure some people here will say that your kid getting taken to task on social media is karmic justice, and they won't be wrong, but at the same time..... isn't adults playing tit for tat a lot like hitting your kid to teach them that hitting is wrong?", "Yta put this energy into your parenting instead of this woman. I wouldn\u2019t be critical of how parents call out my dad parenting.", "NTA although she did recognize her wrongdoing and modified the post which was really insightful and mature. I get being upset but I'm not sure what else she can do here to remedy the situation.\n\nHowever yeah posting a minor's info online is stupid and dangerous. She should have left it as a general anti-bully post and reach out to you individually", "NTA. You have every right to be bothered by that response.  If it were me personally, I would do proactive outreach to the school right now to make them aware that your son in in huge trouble with you for this bullying incident but you would also like to make the school aware that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok for a parent to single out your child online like that - especially given the fact that, as you pointed out, this parent had other ways to get in touch with you.  If the mom wants to help send \u201ca message to everyone\u201d, there are far more effective and mature, non emotional ways to do it. The post needs to come down. \n\nThat being said, I can also imagine how angry I would be if my son was bullied in that way.  Your son crossed a line by a mile and as a parent of the bullied child I would be VERY angry at your son.  In my state of anger I may even think something like \u201cwho the heck raised the type of kid who would do something like this?\u201d.  I\u2019m not saying this to make you feel bad, just to say that maybe you can cut that mom some slack because she is likely not in a very rational state of mind on this issue.", "Yta. And do a better job raising your child. \nThe fact that you are more upset at your child being outed rather the him bullying says a lot about you.", "Your kid is a bully. He should be called out everywhere. He should be ostracized. He should get his ass kicked, as that's about the only way bullies ever learn. You need to make sure he becomes a better person, or else you're just adding one more asshole to the world", "NTA. Kids are going to make fun of each other. How you respond sounds perfectly appropriate. Do you not need to be friends with that person on social media. You contacted them. They removed the part that exposed your child to a wider audience. Be done with it. Punish your kid and let it go", "The irony of your bullying child getting blasted on social media is the most poetic of justices. I'd worry more about getting your kid straightened out than feeling slighted on socials.\n\nYTA", "ETA, generally the way to treat bullying isn\u2019t to bully back. Posting it with the kids information to begin with was silly. The kids are in 8th grade, holding them to an adult standard is going to go poorly. However, holding your child accountable is the job of a parent, which you now say you\u2019ll be doing. So how is she going to explain how it\u2019s the right thing to do as an adult to bully an 8th grader.  \n\nIf the argument is eye for an eye, you\u2019ll eventually go blind.", "To add a different point of view. If her son now gets additional bullying in school from other children because their mother decided it was best to take this sort of thing to the internet who\u2019s to blame then?? I\u2019m not that far removed from my teenage years, so I remember these sorts of things well. I can\u2019t say that OP is a good or a bad parent, I don\u2019t know them personally but to assume it\u2019s \u201clearned behavior\u201d is silly. While in some cases that might be true kids that age (12-13) are very impressionable particularly by their peers. The question OP is asking is if the mother of the child is in the wrong for blasting a 13 year old kid online. Not if their child is in the wrong or not.", "NTA. Your job is to defend your kid from negative life-changing events, even if they are TA.\n\nThis woman should have reached out to you first. She is also TA.

What your son did was wrong, but this is a grown adult attacking your child.", "I think the mother handled it absolutely appropriately. And I hope you give your child hell for that it is absolutely disgraceful behavior.", "NTA\u2026kids do dumb shit all the time, I was bullied as a child and probably could have been considered a bully as a teen. Her complaint is that someone posted online bullying her son so her being a mature adult turned around and did the same thing. Your son is certainly not innocent but there\u2019s no reason to blast anyone one the internet and she would have been an adult and handled the situation maturely. Again I\u2019m not defending the act of bullying but for a grown ass adult to then do that to a child seems a bit inappropriate especially considering you have a relationship with the parents. All she did was add to the bullying cycle.", "YTA. \n\nLet your kid be called out like your kid called hers out. How does it feel? Embarrassed? I bet the kid being fat shamed was, too.", "YTA. \n\nYour kid is a bully. You lose any and all moral high ground.

Maybe he\u2019ll learn a thing or two. \n\nStop raising an AH.", "The mother was desperate.", "I think what the bullied kids mother did was brilliant. Fuck around and find out", "NAH - As far as I can tell, everything has gone the way it should. You had a knee jerk reaction to seeing her post and got upset. But instead of going on a tirade you guys reached out to the mother directly. And you must have done it in a nice enough way to where she felt safe offering the very well-written response that she did. Presumably she changed her post, and is following up through proper channels. **And** **presumably**, you're going to leave her alone and let this matter get handled, and discipline your child for what he did.\n\nI don't think its right to police your feelings on the matter. I think as a parent I would be more mortified that my child did this than upset he was called out publicly. But feeling upset that he was outed publicly is a normal feeling I think. It comes down to your actions and how you handle things moving forward.", "I mean if your kid wasn\u2019t wrong and the other kid was fat I mean shit there is a food chain in school but you can\u2019t be mad that your kid got outed for bullying.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Cyber bullying is huge. And it hurts children who aren\u2019t at the age to understand that as time passes, the bullying will usually calm down.

I\u2019d want others to know that bullying is happening and it\u2019s not okay. Because someday, it could go too far or the bullied child doesn\u2019t have the emotional capability yet to deal with it and they commit suicide.

Also, being in sports or in the honor roll, doesn't make you a good person. Bullying usually comes from people who feel they are superior to others.", "Should she have contacted you directly? In my opinion yes. But also her precious son was just horrifically bullied by your son. Kids have literally committed suicide from this. And you don't know if it's the first time because you weren't monitoring his social media. Other kids being bullied by your son may not tell their parents, and just suffer in silence. Your son is too young to have sm that is not monitored like that. You dropped the ball. Again, I don't think she should have publicly called him out, but I can understand in the heat of the moment she would be mad. Once your wife contacted her she agreed to remove it. That is where you should get over it. It was resolved. She is right to keep the post up though. Parents need to know what is happening online so they can ensure their kids aren't being bullied or being bullied. \nI saw that you said you took his phone away but if my son did this I would also be digging deep with him to figure out why he would want to hurt someone so badly in such a public way. And of course he should apologize to the boy, which I did not see you mention. \nAs to becoming her Facebook friend - your son, who you raised, is bullying her son. Why should she want to share her life with you?", "You're not the AH for being upset, but as someone who was bullied in high school, it not something you can get over easily and the impact it has on you is nowhere near what someone on the \"outside\" would think is justified. She was wrong to call out your son without attempting to resolve this through you first. I get the impression that her kid is bullied left and right so she felt she had to go public with it instead of trying to chase every individual case. It's hard to convey the emotional impact bullying has to the bully but I think that should be your first priority.", "YTA, your kid\u2019s being a dick, deal with it. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t harass people on social media if he doesn\u2019t want the whole fuckin world to find out", "Boo hoo, you and your kid are experiencing social consequences from his actions.\n\nThe mum called your kid out for being a bully and you're mad at her? For what? Highlighting your kids actions as harmful? Trying to locate the parents of the kid bullying her child, so they can actually parent? Are you mad because of his information being public? What about her kid, who has been ridiculed and mocked on a public forum by your kid?\n\nShe said nothing disparaging outside of the fact you need to be more aware of social media and your kid's actions, which are correct. Work through your emotions and realize you are 100% responsible until your kid is an adult. YTA", "YTA\n\nI feel for you. However I do get the sense that you\u2019re far more concerned about the impact on your child than by the fact that this kid has been getting bullied both at school and on line every day for what one assumes is quite some time. And it appears that your kid is at least one of the ringleaders given what he posted was carefully thought out and executed. This wasn\u2019t a spur of the moment act. \n\nAs parents, navigating this new world of social media is incredibly challenging. Have you spoken BEFORE this with your kid? Have you discussed what it means to post something? That something posted, texted, emailed, whatever is out there FOREVER. That you shouldn\u2019t post something unless you\u2019re ready for it to posted and reposted again and again? That once its out there - you have lost control of it. Have you discussed bullying behavior to include online  bullying? Do you do any checks of your kids social media? \n\nThis is going to be harsh - but if you haven\u2019t than yes, you\u2019re behind the power curve as a parent.\n\nMy kids are in Scouts but a lot of organizations have anti-bullying campaigns. We talk to our kids about all the different means of bullying, they have to teach their fellow scouts about it. Cyber bullying, drawing up a contract, etc.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do anything that regimented but a recurring discussion about social media AND bullying is crucial.\n\nI think YTA for \u201cMy son very much appears to be the asshole here. I doubt very much that he is going to be able to defend this and will receive the appropriate hell.\u201d It still sounds like you\u2019re making excuses here - that maybe just maybe this is all some kind of mistake? That your kid really didn\u2019t drag another child on social media about their weight. Reading your other post, in fact there IS no doubt your son did it. But the way you caveat it in your write up is in such a way as you\u2019re trying to downgrade it. \n\nWhat would YOU have done, OP if this was all reversed? \n\nAs hard as this is, this may prove helpful for both boys. \n\nAnd yes, the PSA the other mom posted is tough. Would. You rather this continue unabated and her son try and self harm. Would that PSA be better? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nI can\u2019t fathom why you feel entitled to her adding you as a \u201cfriend\u201d to her FB account so you can review and grade her post? Seriously? Trust her or don\u2019t trust her but I think that\u2019s pretty ballsy of you to think you\u2019re in any position to be calling the shots here.", "YTA Op your child and you get whatever social or personal hell that comes from this. I would have told you to fuck off. You don\u2019t get to be upset what another parent choses to do when you and your child are in the wrong. It is an indictment of your parenting. She has the patience of a saint and I sure as hell would not have reacted that way.", "Seems everyone in here has perfect little teenagers who never do no wrong because you are all perfect parents! You should all put out courses on parenting seen as you are all so perfect", "YTA. Obviously. Was she reactive? Yes. Should you feel shame? Yes, you raised a bully and got called out in social media. \nShe removed the identifying information from the post and that's excellent. \nYou should redirect your anger to yourself and improve your parenting.", "Parent your actual kid before wanting to school a good mom.", "ESH - My main issue is that if I was her child, I would be mortified to know my mom was sharing the picture that was bullying me even if she thought it was in my defense or to shame my bully.", "Why did she think It's okay to post pictures and names of other people children on social media? These other adults are now calling him names here are the AH? Why not handle this with the school or other parents to begin with as you all know each other? It may have been different if all other avenues had been tried first but this is the first reaction and not cool! What she did to a child is just as bad if not worse than what your child did and she is old enough to know better! You are taking responsibility for your child's action and are willing to deal with it, so good job to you. You are NTA.", "I think the mom should have absolutely come to you first but I am guessing she posted when she was in a rage over what happened to her son.", "The bullying wasn't in private so why should the consequences be? YTA", "YTA, sounds like your parenting could use some calling out", "You should show your son the original post.  He should understand the pain he caused this child and his family. He should see the shame he brought on you.  This is also a good lesson in \u201cturnabout is fair play\u201d and \u201cfuck around and find out\u201d.  \n\nYTA.  Also, take away your son\u2019s phone and devices.  He clearly can\u2019t use them responsibly.", "YTA absolutely. Definitely seems like you are more concerned that your kid was outed as a bully as opposed to caring that your son is a bully", "YTA I get the feeling you are only responding to your child being a jackass because you were publicly called out on it.\n\nYour son put this all online under his own name.  He made it public.", "YTA you should know what your child is up to and clearly you aren't. That parent did exactly what I would do in the same situation. Think about it, what would you do if the shoe was on the other foot?", "YTA, I would feel nothing but ashamed if my child did that to another child. You are more focused on the other parent embarrassing all of you and less focused on the fact that your kid was cruel and blasted a photo of another child all over social media. I agree with the other kids mom, you need to be a better parent.", "YTA", "YTA. You haven\u2019t even punished your son yet. Your first action is to complain about the parent calling out you and your child. Stop replying to people and go punish your child. Talk to him about the enormity of what he did and how hurtful it is. \n\nCheese and crackers! Do better.", "yta and youre raising a shitty kid", "Now? Not much more. Originally? Contact us through her husband's old contacts with us as our son's baseball coach, find us on Facebook directly, or failing that go through the school. But others might find blasting it out to all her Facebook friends to find us and naming our kid by name as acceptable, so I asked to find out.", "Right\u2026. Op worry about his kid but what about the kid that\u2019s literally being bullied\u2026", "Actually I even had the feeling that OP was worried about how the post made their parenting appeared in public more than what it could do to their child: \"it is hard to read the post as anything else as a public critique of our parenting which she obviously knows nothing about\"\n\nAs a parent, I would be worried about my child and the other kid as well... not how I look like. The post rubs me in the wrong way somehow.\n\nOP might say that it's kid is an AH for what he did... But the whole post reads as : \"I'm the one who looks bad and I blame that parent's kid\".", "Why is your son allowed to bully someone on social media/publicly but someone can\u2019t point out the bullying publicly OP?!?!", "I don't get the sense the OP is more concerned about his kid being outed than his actions. The OP acknowledges his son was an ass and says he will be punished accordingly. The son's actions are just not the point of this post because the OP isn't denying the son was in the wrong.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable to not want the shitty actions of your teenager posted online to an even wider audience. That kind of thing can have long term, detrimental effects even if the teenager matures and becomes a better person.\n\nI'd also be curious if the victim really wants his mom sharing a mean post about him to friends, family and whomever else follows her.", "Thanks. I get your point of view. To clarify your concerns, he has lost his phone indefinitely already. There was never a question about his actions. My question was meant to be whether or not it is okay to call out a child by name as an adult on social media, even if he is guilty. And I think it is totally okay for there to be differing opinions on that.", "There's a different between a child acting inappropriately and an adult acting inappropriately. Bullied kids mother was upset about public shaming, then turned around and did the same thing to the bully. She should have led by example and addressed the wrongdoing in a mature, respectful way. Instead, she displayed the same lack of emotional intelligence as the bully she was calling out. Kids are growing up, learning, and maturing whereas adults should know better. Bullied kids mom missed the opportunity to teach appropriate behaviour and conflirt resolution.", "If someone wants the parents to take responsibility for their child's bad behaviour, they could notify the parents and the school about this first and see what the response is before going public. Vigilante justice before establishing the facts is a terrible idea.\n\nI remember another post on AITA where everyone told the OP to support their bullied child and to cut off another relatives child. It turns out that the incident the OP was responding to was in fact a response to the long term bullying of the other child by her daughter. The whole thing completely blew up in the OP's face.\n\nFirst you get the truth and that means giving the accused the to respond, then if the response is inadequate, sure go ahead with the public shaming.\n\nAs a teacher I am so very tired of reactive parents who respond before they have the faintest idea of what actually happened. They blow up at the teacher. They get the facts. They are 100% wrong. They back down. I have never had an apology from this sort of parent. And then the relationship between the parent and teacher is permanently damaged.\n\nAs a first step, this was a terrible idea.", "I get why this keeps getting said. I made the post about the other parent's actions, not my own kid's actions. To be clear though, I am much, much more concerned about his actions. It is just that they are cut and dry. He did a terrible thing and needs to be taught otherwise. There is no point in making a post about that. Who would disagree with the notion that the bully is bad?\n\nI thought the other parents' actions were more subjective, however, and it does seem to have played out that way. There is a lot of variance in the replies.", "Thanks! I get that point of view completely. If the situation was reversed, I think it would still be inappropriate of me to put a child on public blast, but to each their own. He did a shitty thing and is getting shitty results.", "This", "Thanks. I was guessing that a lot of people would think it is okay to call out a child on social media by name, which is why I posted this. It is interesting to see all the different opinions for sure.", "Thanks. I think everything you have said is pretty right. The only very minor quibble I have is this: She put out what was basically a public blast that she wanted to get into contact with us to talk about it. I just would expect someone to accept a friend request at that point because Facebook can do a pretty good job of hiding messages from non-friends, but that is a minor thing.", "Yeah, I thought people might feel this way for sure. It still would feel wrong to me if the situation was reversed. I don't like the idea of an adult calling out a child by name on social media, but there is definitely some karma to it in this case at least. And of course you are right on social media.", "Yes she is an adult and far better ways to deal than doxing a child as a first response. She should know better. Also I see no mention of a history of the child's behavior so it seems a one off. There are better ways to teach children right from wrong for one mistake. If this had been an ongoing issue that had not been resolved first in adult responsible manor the post still could have been made without doxing the child.  All these people that have been victims of bullying here are willing to go after a young child in a most disgusting manor for one mistake are really sad and cruel. This is coming from someone that was also bullied a lot when I was a child too.", "Wow, of all the comments, this is the winner for the most online!\n\nI am definitely more upset with him than her. His situation is obvious and doesn't require outside input. He loses the freedom we had trusted him with up to this point. \n\nTo my knowledge, my son has no idea he was called out online by adults. I am not sure why we would share that.\n\nOf course we bear responsibility for what our son does and posts. No questions there. \n\nAs for the fat shaming, I don't even know how to answer that. I don't think weight has ever come up to my memory.", "Your post contains a lot of guesses about stuff you can't possibly know.", "You'll be relieved to know then that I am indeed more concerned about how my son grows up than whether or not she accepts a friend request on Facebook.", "Oh god no. I would have wanted her to contact us directly ASAP, either through her husband if he still has our info or through the school if not. There needs to be major consequences here.", "That's fair. I will try to answer your questions, but I don't have a lot to give you.\n\nYes, he started it. No question there. Maybe I am wrong to hold adults and kids to different expectations?\n\nUnfortunately. even though she made a post calling for people to find us to talk to us, she doesn't seem to want to talk to us beyond what I posted. My wife was extremely apologetic. She won't and doesn't need to give me the chance to apologize. My son hasn't been given the chance to apologize yet, but he will be forced to.\n\nI don't have information yet on how other kids may or may not have participated. I don't even 100% know the other kid has even seen what my kid posted given that he doesn't has social media, let alone how he is coping. She doesn't want to share that which is her prerogative.", "There is some karma here for sure. I hope he learns too.", "Yeah, there is no question about his role or how to handle that.", "The child is the AH.", "Thanks for your thoughts!\n\nNo one wanted her husband to address our son. Sorry if that was confusing. What I meant was that he has (or at least had) our contact info and could have potentially gotten ahold of us directly rather than through crowdsourcing.\n\nI don't know what conversation you are referring to that I hate in the second paragraph and couldn't follow it because of that, sorry.\n\nI don't really see her as bullying, but I guess you could draw that parallel. Bullying in response to bullying. My question was meant to be whether or not it is acceptable for an adult to publicly call out a 13 year old.\n\nAnd of course this is a major, major teachable moment.", "The coach should have dealt with this. A coach's job doesn't end when they leave the field. A coach is responsible for teaching both the physical and moral.", "Thanks for your feedback. I get why you think I am focusing only on that side of this because it is what I made the post about, but rest assured my son is not having a good time currently. There just isn't a reason to make a post soliciting thoughts on that side of things because who could possibly defend him? He is so clearly in the wrong here.", "Thanks for your response. I do plan on continuing to parent my kid.", "Thank you for taking the time to respond. I am definitely ashamed of his actions in this case, that is for sure.", "Haha man reddit is the best. My kid sucks here and I am responsible, that is for sure. The rest of this? Oh boy.", "Wow, that\u2019s a lot of pent up rage. You think an adult should assault a child because of bullying? That\u2019s beyond an AH move. I was bullied relentlessly as a child and I think throwing stones at the bully isn\u2019t going to do anything productive. \n\nOP\u2019s son is definitely in the wrong and a jerk but violence isn\u2019t the answer. OP punished their son and isn\u2019t taking this lightly. However, there\u2019s a reason a child\u2019s name isn\u2019t released to the media when they commit a crime. \n\nAlso you can be amazing loving parents and still have a kid that turns out to be an AH. I\u2019ve seen it happen many times. \n\nAlso, I know a guy like you. Bullied is school and decided to become a police officer so he could bully other people and take all his rage out on others. He was such an AH he got fired, which is hard when you\u2019re in a police union. The guy needed up going through a ton of counseling and is actually a decent human being now. Get some therapy and let go of the rage. It\u2019s only hurting you.", "Thank you!", "I think we are in lockstep on this one. Thanks for your feedback.", "There is really nothing that could \u201clead up to this\u201d that would justify publicly mocking someone\u2019s weight. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s exactly like hitting your kid to teach them that hitting is wrong, although I understand the concern about putting minors on social media. The teenager publicly mocked the other boy on social media for something he may have no control over, but the mother publicly called out the teenager for something he chose to do. Not exactly the same as the hitting analogy. I think the father should focus more on the fact that his son has been using social media to bully others, instead of worrying as much about the other mother\u2019s posts, you have a much bigger problem on your hands. I\u2019m going with yta.", "Thanks. I didn't post anything about my son because it is irrelevant to the question I intended. My intent was to give context and ask if people thought it was okay for someone to call out a child by name on social media, but I think I over explained and muddied that up quite a bit.\n\nBut if you're curious, he is a pretty normal kid. This will be the first time he has ever been in trouble with the school. He plays sports every season. He was on honor roll last report card. We generally don't have problems with him. Is there something else you want to know?", "Thanks. That is how I feel too.", "Totally agreed on all points! Thanks!", "People keep saying this so obviously I failed at communicating, which is on me. I am infinitely more upset at my son than her. I just didn't make a post about his actions because they are indefensible, I would hope. What would be the purpose? I thought whether or not it is okay to call out a 13 year old as an adult in a public forum was a debatable question though, so I posted it this way.", "Yeah, I found it even more problematic that the eye for an eye exchange was between a kid and an adult.", "No, their job as a parent is to do their best to raise their child to be an independent and decent human being, not protect them from the consequences of their own actions. The kid isn\u2019t being attacked, he\u2019s being called out for his actions.", "Thanks. I agree that she should have reached out to us directly, of course. I also agree that in general by job is to protect my kid which pushed me to the impulse to feel upset that she named him directly in a public post. At the same time, he deserves whatever the school does to him here. I think she crossed a line but no so far that I need to intervene with the school in terms of how they handle it. Thanks again!", "He is not having a good time, that is for sure.", "Thanks, that is mostly how I see it too.", "Didn\u2019t your son do the exact same thing to bully their child? All she did was criticise his actions and your parenting, she said nothing cruel like your son did.", "So she needs to do all of the work to help you sweep this under the rug?", "Your kid deserves to their name out there though as a bully. I would want to know who was or could potentially bully my kid or kids.", "I agree with what the other parent did. If your son can bully her son publicly, then your son deserves to be shamed publicly. A public shaming is one of the most effective ways to stop a bully.\nThe parent of the bullied child might have reasoned that if you didn't care enough to teach your child not to be a bully and you didn't care enough to monitor your child's online activity, then you probably wouldn't care enough to put a stop to it, if she had reached out in private.", "This might have been appropriate if they'd already brought it to OP's attention and they did nothing about it, but this is the first they'd heard of the issue.

And I get it. \n\nBut we don't know what went through her mind when she did that so, while she should have contacted the school etc, she, heavily charged with emotions used the internet. \n\nThis is a parallel for the bullying. However, it is a very complicated place to be for both of you, so I can't understand if I blame her completely. \n\nObviously she blamed your parenting and obviously you might have been a great parent but he picked it up online or from his peers but parents are unfortunately always blamed. \n\nPlease don't punish him in a cruel and blind fashion. He just needs to understand and he will, coming from you.\n\nI am sorry for being harsh. But some people are expecting the coach to educate the kid 24*7 would have been a worse decision for both the kids. Additionally, it is better coming from parents. At least what I feel from an adult who was a teen until recently.\n\nThe fact that you are ready to teach your child makes you a wonderful parent.", "I have tried to frame this as best as I can. \n\nA teacher is responsible for treating his pupils with respect and equality. And is responsible for teaching them responsibility etc etc. However one of the pupil is antagonising his son. Interference might lead to further resistance from the bully who would continue to bully him without the presence of any witness.\n\nTeens aren't receptive and in this case, the parent himself wanted more work from a distressed mother to go through old contacts and Facebook pages and wait for the OP to respond while their son suffered mentally.\n\nI hate abuse and the use of the internet in achieving vigilant justice but his son, if isn't less than 10 has a basic understanding of what is hurtful. There has to be a reason why OP is protesting so much for his own son. To save his son from online prosecution. Yes, he is a child so he shouldn't be prosecuted but he deserved to be called out. Even if it was public. She couldn't have waited for her son to take a drastic step so she called out. Bullying is not a minor crime. The amount of cruelty you need to possess to demean, publicly another person or child, needs to be corrected ASAP. No offence, ignoring or making light of the situation will worsen his behaviour in the future. Sure it was vigilant, don't know if it practically correct but she needed to protect her child. Was she supposed to wait for the child's death until the OP responded? \n\nShe even removed his name later on and only used it to connect to the parents of her child's bully. Let us face it, we don't know what happened before it lead to her blasting his son on the internet. So instead of blaming them and victimising a bully, the op should get over it and address his son instead of blindly punishing him. I am not even asking for a blind punishment. Talk to his son. Send to therapy. Etc to enable better emapthetic approach to his peers.\n\nHowever, expecting teachers to perform major legwork and absolving parents of all the blame is positively blind. I get that you hate vigilant online justice but in a situation where teachers are overworked and underpaid, do they really have to monitor their students 24*7 when parents can't do that.\n\nI hate teachers who are blind and don't do anything for their students when needed but I also hate people who only want teachers to do everything. They can't teach kids morals. Moral values are incorporated in early stages of life. Not when the child is old enough to have a coach. Not saying he can't improve but it is above the skill and pay grade of a school baseball coach. \n \nHe requires parenting and therapy.\n\nIn this case, I didn't call him YTA or NTA. I am just saying that he needs to stop blaming his son's victim and talk to his son before something worse happens.\n\nBullying isn't a minor thing. It has an effect on the child who is being bullied. He will carry the emotional garbage forever. Is that justified?", "You\u2019re right, your son being punched would be far too severe. Her son killing himself for incessant bullying? A common response and perfectly acceptable. YTA.", "It was the high school bullies I knew who became cops, not the victims. But that's just me.", "If you are saying by not taking it lightly = losing phone privileges, i can't say i agree. But hey, I'm not the guy raiaing the bully.", "Yeah, as OP I am on board with everything you are saying. I think I might have overexplained and messed up the question I meant to ask though. My kid is the asshole between the kids. Obviously we bear responsibility for what our kid does too.\n\nMy question was whether or not her method of dealing with it by naming a kid on a public forum was appropriate. If her kid had struck my kid, to use your hitting example, I would think posting about it on social media and calling him out by name was inappropriate. But I also wondered if others would agree, hence the post.", "> you have a much bigger problem on your hands\n\nThat I 100% agree with. But we don't know that they aren't. It's just that dealing with his kid is not the advice he asked for, so it's not the advice I dispensed. I hope that they consider the bullying to be the more important problem. Their son is only \"theirs\" until he's 18. They have 6 years to fix him being an asshole. This is quite urgent. It's just not the matter I was asked to weigh in on.\n\n>the mother publicly called out the teenager for something he chose to do\n\nShould we normalize that? When you were a kid if you were being bullied did your Mom stand outside the school with a bullhorn calling out your bullies and what they did? How is that productive? I can guarantee you the victim is mortfiied by his Mom's behavior.\n\n> There is really nothing that could \u201clead up to this\u201d that would justify publicly mocking someone\u2019s weight. \n\nI never said anything about justifying the **SON'S** behavior. What I said is that I couldn't judge the **PARENTS** without knowing what's lead up to their son behaving that way. I can sure judge the son, but again... I wasn't asked to. His Dad called him an AH, right?", "I say it\u2019s a good lesson for him on posting publicly online. What you post on social media becomes open to the public, many people have learned this the hard way. Any social media post can come back to haunt you even years later. This is why people need to be careful about minors being on social media. If he can post publicly about someone else, it\u2019s logical that he can be posted about as well.", "> But if you're curious, he is a pretty normal kid. This will be the first time he has ever been in trouble with the school. He plays sports every season. He was on honor roll last report card. We generally don't have problems with him. Is there something else you want to know?\n\nNot really, as you said... it's not really relevant to what you asked. I mean, if you asked for advice on how to deal with your kid, that'd be a different story, yanno?\n\nMore people in this world have been bullied, myself included, than were bullies. I think a lot of people are taking what your kid did personally and it's skewing them into reacting to that... instead of what you actually asked.", "Its not even an eye for an eye. Your kid humiliated another kid and body shamed him which can impact his mental health into adulthood. What if he develops an eating disorder because your kid thinks its ok to openly call him fat? Worry about disciplining your kid", "I don\u2019t want to be picky - but I don\u2019t see this as an \u201ceye for an eye\u201d. As my kids have made clear to me again and again - nobody is on FB but old farts like parents. Kids that age are not on FB. Neither one of my kids (15 and 18) even have FB accounts. And frankly, they give big poop about what is going on on FB. Don\u2019t care what gets posted.\n\nOther social media sites? They care.", "[deleted]", "The other parents are going to be reaching out to the school. They're going after you and your son in every way possible.\n\nAlso, your son deserves to be punished. No sports teams, that sort of thing. There needs to be consequences, but the consequences should not follow them into their adulthood like this woman was trying to do to your boy.", "You seem more concerned with how it makes you look so I\u2019m wondering what your perception of an appropriate punishment is", "Interesting! Thank you. Personally I don't love the eye for an eye argument here because she is an adult and he isn't, but I definitely get the impulse to lash out when your kid has been hurt.", "My apologies, I am trying to respond to everyone but I am not following what you mean here exactly.", "It\u2019s OP\u2019s job to know what his kid is posting, not the other parents. OP\u2019s son already made it public with his post.", "I don't think we can say which they're more concerned about in general, they're just asking about one part of the issue they're not sure about. They do acknowledge their son is the problem in the bullying issue, and is going to \"receive the appropriate hell\" as punishment. Just because they're not also asking about their parenting doesn't mean they're downplaying their son's actions.", "I directly said my son is the asshole here, didn't I? If I didn't. he is.", "Yes, OP is saying that zero effort had been put into parenting his child in the area of social media.  He instead wants the parent of the child his kid bullied to be responsible for protecting his kid\u2019s privacy.", "Sorry, I wasn't clear. His handle was a play on his actual name in a way that say someone from his school would know who he is. If it wasn't, she wouldn't have been able to post it as a means to have others identify us I don't think.", "I apologize. I am trying to answer all questions but I am not following what you are asking. Could you try rephrasing it?", "I am 100% culpable for his actions.", "Because he is 13. Same reason we don't publish the names of minors accused of crimes.", "I don't deny there is a lesson to be learned in karma here!", "I would not expect an adult to call out a child by name in a public forum, even a guilty one. It would never occur to me to do this in reverse. I would have used old contact information we have from when his dad was our son's baseball coach or get the contact info from the school.", "There are no bad responses. And what do you mean with the part in quotes? He is an infinite percent in the wrong. I am incredibly disappointed in his behavior.", "I need to learn how to communicate more clearly, apparently. A big hard definite no on posting on reddit first before talking to him. He was addressed first.\n\nI might not be remembering 100% correctly, and maybe my wife clarified after I went to work, but I don't think we mentioned the convoluted way we learned about it. He just knows we talked to the other parent. I want him to learn that this action is despicable on its own merits. If he asked how we found out, I wouldn't hesitate to tell him, but it didn't seem all that important during the heavy conversation.", "Those were all guesses. #1 was an extremely wrong guess. #2 is a larger conversation, but you are right overall. #3 is an even more extremely wrong guess somehow.", "> that OP appears to be more upset at the other parents method of addressing the issue than his son\u2019s bullying, which is pretty bloody clear from OP\u2019s own post. \n\nThe OP does not owe you any performative anger at their son. Since dealing with the son is not the subject that OP asked for advice on, we know nothing about how the OP feels about it... aside from the fact that he called his son an AH.\n\n> that as parents it\u2019s their job to monitor their sons online behaviour, which is true\n\nI agree with you on this part. It was the only part of your post I agreed with. I can find no flaw here. \n\nThey definitely dropped the ball at monitoring his online activity. First off, my 11 year old has no social media of **ANY** **KIND** because I don't think it's appropriate. Second, if she did have social media, stuff she's posting out to the world, I'd get to see it.\n\n> That their son had to learn that fat shaming is ok somewhere and likely learned it at home. This one you have tiny bit of a point on, but it\u2019s still not a guess. It\u2019s a logical conclusion.\n\nIt's a possible conclusion, but it's also equally possible that he's hanging out with a charming group of 12 year assholes and got it from them. It's quite clear from the upset Mother's post that this kid is not her kid's only bully. I think there is likely a whole group of kids teasing this kid for being fat and that this post is only the tip of the iceberg.", "The first reaction for the parent to call the bully out on Social media was not the right thing to do. They should have called you the parent and have a talk. If you had not took action to correct your sons behavior then maybe post something.  Why do people think putting everything on social media is a good thing I will never understand. I don't think you were wrong but do make sure your son knows how bad it is to bully. NTA IMO", "Yeah, that's my experience, too. The girl who bullied me grew up to become a cop.", "No, they didn\u2019t break any law. Reposting a social media post is not illegal, even if it was a minors. If it was a question of child pornography that would be different, but when a minor posts on social media there is no expectation of privacy.", "Is this eye for an eye though? All they did is highlight your kids actions, or did they also make comments about your kids appearance and/or weight?", "Of course you don\u2019t love that argument. After all, it affects your child. \n\nIt was her child being blasted on social media. And this doesn\u2019t even begin to qualify as lashing out. Parents in a school should be aware of who the bullies are so that they can advise their children on how to properly handle your little AH.", "This isn't eye for an eye. She said nothing insulting about you or your child. Calling out bullying is not the same as bullying and it's shocking you can't seem to understand that. But it might explain where your kid got the idea that bullying is acceptable,", "This was not an eye for an eye, this was simply showing what your kid did.", "You want her to do all of these steps to contact you personally to what end?  Simple, to rug sweep it so that other parents don't know that your son is a bully.", "Yeah and OP is taking appropriate steps to avoid it in the future. Parents are people who make mistakes too, and they're fixing it. Doesn't make what the other lady did okay when that was the first action she took to help her kid. I'm sure her son isn't real thrilled to have his bullying openly aired on the internet, either.", "OK but I can tell you if my kid was this cruel, I wouldn't be running to Reddit to see if I should still be upset over them being called out. The issue has already been resolved since the other parent agreed to remove the name.", "Listen, you failed your kid in parenting them that internet lasts forever. Does your kid know everyone knows you raised an asshole now? This might make him reconsider his actions online.  It\u2019s public information and well, kids who are bullies don\u2019t receive compassion from society. Yta for the shit parenting.", "So, the other kids parent didn't know who the bully was and reached out to get an ID? This seems reasonable. They didn't know the name was a play on the actual name.\n\nThe parent took down the identifying info once it was confirmed it was  your kid and you asked them to do so.\n\nI don't see what the bullied kid's parent did wrong here.\n\nThe reality is, your kid posted it on social media in a way that everyone could see. It could have been 100x worse for your kid if another kid from his schoold decided to do a TikTok about his post. You and your kid are incredibly lucky it didn't go down like that.\n\nYour kid is too young to not have his social media posts monitored for exactly this reason, and you 100% know this b/c you are on Reddit and know what can easily happen. This is on you and your kid. How are you and your wife going to take responsibility for this, outside of punishing your son?\n\nThis parent actually did you a favor by getting your son ID'ed as soon as they did b/c the longer the post was up, the more likely it was going to be used by some kid for likes and clout.\n\nSo yeah, it is good the post stays up as a reminder to  parents and kids that this stuff gets passed around and the internet lives forever and a less gracious person would have kept in identifying info AND send a flock of trolls after your kid.", "Okay, so how was she supposed to get the other parents identify who it was then?", "OK, you are not 100% culpable for his actions, kids are quite unpredictable and if he hadn't shown signs before, how would you know? But know you do, you should keep an eye on him.", "Why does he have social media with his full name on it?", "the kid who was bullied was also 13", "You just don't want other parents to know what he did.  To rug sweep it and keep it quiet.", "Yes. And all the parents of all the 13 year old should be aware that your son is an obnoxious bully.", "theres also a parenting lesson", "times are different now, your child acted like a bully online and he was rightfully called out for it. hopefully you and your child learned your lesson: FAFO, and people will track you down and name/shame y'all deservingly so.", "Of course, so that you can hide it.", "It\u2019s not so much calling your kid out but calling you and your parenting out.", "The fact that you caveated that he \"appears\" to be the asshole and just \"doubt\" he has a way to justify it.", "And what consequences is he facing other then losing his phone?", "Your comments and responses say otherwise though.", "They're not upset that the kid was called out, they're upset it happened because the other parent made no attempt to solve the problem outside social media. Not everything needs to be online as a first resort, especially parenting issues.", "If he's that concerned about online privacy, his kid shouldn't have such public social media handles and his name splashed everywhere - particularly if he's very clearly unsupervised and is using said online identity to bully others. Sounds like a lesson for OP more than anything.", "I mean would you be happy if there was an issue with something you were in charge of, and the first you heard about it was a social media post? I'd be unhappy too, because if there's a problem with something I'm doing I want to fix it. OP wasn't given the chance to fix the problem with their son. That's the problem.", "I would think I had failed in multiple fairly serious ways if this even got to this point.", "OP didn't come here for judgement on his parenting."]}
