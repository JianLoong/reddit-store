{"id": 1958, "submission_id": "yrfv7h", "title": "AITA for not wanting to celebrate our anniversary after husband volunteered to cover weekend shift leaving me with two kids at 5 weeks postpartum all weekend?", "selftext": "Last weekend was the weekend before our anniversary. Coworker asks last minute if my husband can cover the weekend for him so he can take an unplanned vacation trip. Husband already works long hours during the week and I barely see him, sometimes the toddler is asleep both when he leaves and gets home. I gave birth 5 weeks ago (he took zero time off) and we have help during the week but not on the weekend. On Friday I also wasn\u2019t feeling well on top of normal postpartum issues and he knew this. \n\nI adamantly told my husband I was not ok with him taking the shifts, but he did anyway. The money won\u2019t affect our overall budget. I feel disrespected and hurt, like he can\u2019t say no to a coworker but can say no to his wife. We\u2019ve been having disagreements about the amount he\u2019s working for a while. For his perspective, he wants to be a good coworker and maybe is motivated by the money. \n\nNow I don\u2019t even feel like celebrating our anniversary and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being too extreme. (It would just be making a special dinner since he\u2019ll be working that day and the next day anyway). I also don\u2019t want to add to his stress level since he works hard and having a newborn is already stressful, but I also don\u2019t want him to be conditioned that choosing work over family has no consequences.\n\nEdit: I agree I need to work on my communication since I feel like I was pretty clear and got ignored. That is more of a relationship advice question and counseling to improve communication is probably what we need. Maybe just telling him that over a normal dinner will be a wake up call. I know that working hard is a way he shows he cares by supporting us (though I work too when not on leave) so it\u2019s not malicious, and we went out to a big dinner recently and maybe he feels like that was the celebration. I feel less mad after getting some perspective, thank you.", "created_utc": 1668088883, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrfv7h/aita_for_not_wanting_to_celebrate_our_anniversary/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For heavens sake stop having children with him!", "NTA, considering he's expecting you to cook a special dinner for y'all's anniversary when he should be taking you out at the very least, or even bringing home takeout. However, this doesn't sound like something you two can't move past. I think with proper communication and effort, it can be fixed. Good luck. Talk to your husband about how you feel.", "Nta he needs to help you more op and you should talk to him more about that. You should post this in relationship advice", "NTA. Try to sit down and have a talk with him. He can always be a \"good coworker\", but he can't be a good husband and good dad if he's not around and has no wife.\nAnd if you really have no money issues, then there's no reason to take on extra work. Especially when the coworker only wanted to go on vacation, if he had an emergency then I would understand covering for him. I don't get how he's letting you do everything with the kid and even when you say you don't feel well he ignores it. Like what. He realizes it's also his child, right? So yeah I understand you not wanting to celebrate your anniversary. Just let it be and see if he will do anything instead.", "I'm not seeing an interpersonal conflict, since your husband isn't saying that he wants to celebrate the anniversary at all.\n\nBut I will say NTA for not wanting to celebrate the anniversary.\n\nAlso, at the time when you need him for support, he's basically ditching you in favor of work. What concerns me most is that your needs/desires aren't even being considered. He doesn't even concern himself with what you're going through right now. It sounds like he's basically saying, \"I don't care what you want. I want to cover this shift and I'm going to.\"\n\nPast time the two of your addressed his priorities.", "NTA: *You'd* be the one cooking the anniversary dinner? Nuh-uh.\n\nIf he wants to celebrate your anniversary he can get take out on his way home or cook dinner himself.\n\nSadly, if you don't mention it, will he even remember? Not knowing details of your marriage (and you do not have to share them) but a serious talk with him about priorities is in order. He hasn't been around really at all since the birth of your new baby? I am so sorry.", "NTA.  Your husband needs to focus on being a better partner, instead of a better coworker.  His choice is also really inconsiderate towards you and *why would you* feel like celebrating your anniversary to a man who gives your anniversary a lower priority than a coworker's unplanned vacation???  There do need to be consequences for his sh!tty actions.", "NTA your husband is in the wrong. Do nothing for your anniversary. If he wants to make plans to celebrate he can. But don't add to your work load", "I'm going to strongly suggest you and your husband go see a therapist. \n\nI see this as him not really wanting to be involved with your child.  He didn't take time off for your delivery and spends all the day at work.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "**NTA**\n\nAt all. Honestly, it doesn't sound like there's much in this marriage to be celebrating right now, and far from being an AH, you're just acknowledging that: that while you may have been married for X number of years, at the moment that doesn't like something to celebrate. \n\nAnd why would it? You just went through a major medical ordeal (even a fairly straightforward birth is still a major medical ordeal for your body) and your husband took literally NOT A SINGLE DAY OFF OF WORK to support you or your recovery, or to welcome your new child into the world and bond with it . . . but he didn't hesitate to take on extra shifts so his coworker could HAVE A VACATION WEEKEND? And from the sound of it, that's just one example in an ongoing pattern of behaviour that you have repeatedly tried to address with him to no avail. In fact, he doesn't even seem to care enough to acknowledge that it's hurting and upsetting you, much less try to fix it.\n\nMy friend, you are the furthest thing from an AH. You are physically and emotionally exhausted, dealing with the (very significant) effects of having recently given birth, and trying to care for a newborn and a toddler, and your partner isn't being much of a partner at all. Honestly, to have an anniversary celebration in the midst of this, given how you're feeling, would be a bit of a farce. \n\nNTA, but I suggest counseling. Preferably marriage counseling, but if your husband won't go with you, then even individual, to help you understand that you deserve better than this.", "Info- is money tight in the house with the new child? Is he completely transparent with all finances?", "Is this about money or escaping responsibility? I mean, he's not caring for kids at work. Overtime and covering shifts might be his excuse to stay away from the house.", "NTA. \n\nI wanted to comment on the bit you mentioned about how working a lot is his way of showing he cares. \nIf you don\u2019t need the extra money and what you DO need is more support from your partner at home, I think it\u2019s an AH move on his part to completely disregard your feelings about it. My own father was a workaholic as a way of avoiding parental and household duties, and even though he was a major AH he got away with it because he \u201cdid it for us.\u201d \nThe phrase \u201churtful helping\u201d comes to mind when your partner is avoiding familial duties by working in excess of what your financial needs require. \n\nI\u2019m hoping your partner is not an AH like my dad was, but even good people can do morally questionable things when they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. Therapy sounds like a great choice and good on you for realizing it\u2019s needed. Good luck! \ud83e\udd8b", "NTA, but it sounds like your anniversary means more to you than to him. \n\nHe appears to be doing everything he can to avoid being a husband and a father. You need to figure out if you have a partner or a man who just had a family b/c that is what he is supposed to want.", "You two need to communicate more and work on your relationship. You shouldn't be punishing your partner, not a sign of a healthy relationship:\n\n> I also don\u2019t want him to be conditioned that choosing work over family has no consequences.", "NAH\n\nUnless you are completely financially independent then he is probably motivated by money. Food and shelter are important. You taking time off work after giving birth is important. Him spending quality time with you and the kids is important. Luxury items are important. Pick your priorities.", "Gonna say NAH. You have a new baby and he is probably stressing about money. Even if you think that your finances are ok, he is still going to go over everything that could go wrong and that he needs more savings to help. Reputation at work is also a very real thing that outside people don\u2019t believe in. But on your end, I totally get the frustration. You are tired, in pain and stressed out, At minimum. Maybe see if you have any family that can take the kids for a few hours. You can sleep, relax, or get anything done you need without having to stop to help the kids. I only add that since I know some people clean to de-stress. If you don\u2019t want to make dinner for him because of how you are feeling physically and how worn out you are emotionally, then that is totally valid.  It please don\u2019t do it to punish him. \n\nTry to talk it out, and maybe word it that since you both are doing so much on the actual day of your anniversary, then maybe you guys can splurge a bit and order out from your favorite place. Cuddle on the couch if the kids are asleep and munch on your food with a movie in the background. Less work for you, and you still get to make the most of the time you do have. I will just add, that I genuinely have no harsh judgement for either of you. But you do need to communicate your needs to him, and genuinely listen to what he says as well. Burn out is real, on both sides of the parenting/work spectrum.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
