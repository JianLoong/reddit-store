Your wife was talking to him in child appropriate terms, and you decided to be harsh. Why? He's 7. You have to talk to children in terms they are able to handle at their age. You give them more details as they grow and mature.

It\u2019s worth the investment. \n\nEspecially the way she died. That\u2019s a LOT- but I don\u2019t think honesty is wrong because it\u2019s a very real part of life and it\u2019s very public and most of all, they need to know they can speak up if they ever have these feelings and be met with love and trust and overwhelming support.", "YTA.

My dad, in no uncertain terms, explained what happened to me. It was absolutely NOT something I could really process at the time. I could not understand why she would do something like that. I did not know what depression was. I ended up being angry at my sister for a long time, because I could not understand why our family wasn\u2019t worth living for. Hearing about things like that at the age I did has left me with trauma and anxiety that I still have not been able to fully work through even now, almost 20 years later. \n\nI understand your thought process of not wanting to lie to him, but you should have waited until he was older to tell him the truth about how his nanny died. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss", "YTA \n\nThis is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade though. \n\nYour child is grieving and now you told him that his nanny chose to end her life (and leave him and her job without saying goodbye on purpose since she chose to end her life).

The mixed messages from your wife and you, though, might arguably be more confusing. \n\nUltimately, a few sessions with a child psychologist might not be the worst thing in the world, and you two might be able to go with him.

But the fact that you and your wife did not discuss this and weren't on the same page adds even more instability to this situation.  Your son was already having issues with this loss and you two not in agreement of what you think is appropriate for him could be very damaging.", "First of all, I am very sorry for your family\u2019s loss.

I think you should seek out grief counselling for both of your kids, but especially for son.

YTA\n\nI think 7yo is a bit young to have a suicide convo.  And even then \"it was her own choice to die\", isn't terrible accurate.  I don't think anyone chooses depression, self harm or suidical idealization and attempts. This is a topic well beyond a typical 7yo understand (there are exceptions.  If someone cannot think of those exceptions, consider yourself lucky).\n\nIf I was your spouse, I would be mad at you, too. Kid was already struggling to deal, and then you piled on extra that was unnecessary.  Let kids stay kids, I am not opposed to \"sugar coating\" the harsh bits when they are so young.\n\nAre you afraid your son will grow up too \"soft\"?", "This is a really tough situation but I'm going to say NAH. By 7 a child is likely to know about suicide by hearing people talk about it or reading it on the news. I certainly did from watching the news on TV and hearing my parents talk about Marilyn Monroe's suicide. They were big fans. I remember asking my 2nd grade teacher about the difference between suicide and commit suicide. \n\nIt would have been worse if you lied about how she died. I think the words you used (chose to die) were appropriate.\n\nBut I also understand why your wife wanted to lie to them. Suicide is so stigmatized and hushed and as a result some children really don't know about it by 7, and parents wouldn't want to their first introduction to it to be someone close to them.", "NTA.

It's an incredibly difficult situation to be in and you're doing the best you can. Obviously you had no ill intentions here. But yeah, you should've discussed it with your wife before giving that answer. It's definitely too much for a 7 year old to digest. I still have a hard time processing the suicide of loved ones, as an adult.", "Oh, this breaks my heart for everyone involved but I think you did the right thing. NTA.", "NAH, but you should apologize. Then you and your wife should get on the same page asap and also review some child grief counseling resources.", "NAH. Although I think some well intentioned mistakes were made.\n\nOP, I just want to say that someone I love committed suicide when I was seven. Nobody ever sat me down and explained what death was, or told me that their death was self inflicted, any questions I had were brushed off or I was yelled at for asking. I knew though, I heard the whispered conversations behind closed doors and when I was supposed to be asleep, dug out the death certificate myself, found the note, put the pieces together. I just wanted to know, to understand. Someone I loved was gone and everyone else I loved was suffering, I was so angry that I was being left out of the loop and dismissed as being too young to understand. That people were talking about me in front of my face telling eachother that I didn't need to know, or that I didn't need to know everything, or arguing about the best way to explain it to me. I don't remember ever being told what death was or what it meant, but I remember knowing as soon as I was told what it meant, and being so desperate to understand that I focused on finding that knowledge instead of grieving.\n\nSo, I don't know that there's ever going to be an age appropriate way to explain suicide to a seven year old child, especially when there are so many adults who don't, and will never, understand how it feels to be suicidal. I do know that therapy could have saved me a lot of pain and confusion, having someone to talk to who wasn't grieving, someone to ask the hard questions without fear of hurting them, someone to walk me through my feelings and keep me from feeling so lost. I carried that death with me for a very long time, it was the first experience I had with death other than pets and TV, it was handled terribly because the people in my life were grieving and had no idea how to handle it themselves. It still marks me in some ways. Knowing how they died and why helped me navigate my own mental health decline and eventual suicide attempts as a teenager. It was the reason why I got on meds and why I'm still alive today, because even though I hated myself, I didn't want to make anyone ever feel the way I had felt as a child losing one of my heroes because they were in too much pain to keep going.\n\nI don't know how you worded things, how graphic you were or how softly your wife tried to approach it, I don't know how or if you could have done any better other than talking about how it should be handled before you were both in front of your son trying to handle it completely differently. I do know that if either of you feel like you've made a mistake or not handled it in a way that is helpful for your child, there is no shame in admitting that and asking for professional help. Do the best for your child, because the first time you lose a loved one often informs how you'll deal with grief and loss as you grow up. I hope that your son finds some peace with the loss you've all suffered, and that you as parents find some grace for eachother, you're both flying by the seat of your pants here.", "NTA  - Even though I personally never suffered a loss like this, I had major issues with the idea of death and would lie awake in bed at 8 years old thinking about how I've used up 10% of my life already.

Children don\u2019t comprehend like us and that kind of statement sets of anxiety that ANYONE he knows can die at anytime just because they are young and that he too could die at anytime\u2026this thinking is unhealthy and traumatic.\nPlease please consider a good therapist for your child and possibly a few family sessions on how to process grief.\n*I have a career in child development and work with young children experiencing death/grief of loved ones.*", "I like this response very much. I personally don\u2019t see anything wrong with telling the truth. My 4 year old knows about people dying and where babies come from due to curiosity born from events that have happened in our lives. It happens. The only misstep was the \u201cchoosing to die\u201d particularly without the concept of her brain being sick as said above, or another appropriate explanation for mental illness. However I don\u2019t think it can\u2019t be undone. I also feel therapy could be helpful due to his loss. Must be like losing an immediate family member. I\u2019m sorry", "GREAT way to explain it to anyone, not just little kids. SO many people don't consider clinical depression, MDD, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, etc to be \"real\" illnesses.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, *any* condition that can prove fatal if left untreated (and even with treatment sometimes) is a serious illness, period.", "Agreed. What if the nanny died of something like overdose or murder? Would OP be explaining that to the kids too?\n\nThere are lines OP, maybe in a few years your kids would have been mature enough to take it in, but at 7 it's too much.", "To be fair, 'choosing to die because their brain has an illness that makes them feel really sad' is about as complicated an explanation as a 7 year old can handle.\n\nIf you start getting nuanced about choice with a kid that young, they'll probably either live in fear that their brain is suddenly going to make then want to kill themself, or be scared every time they get sad because they think there's no choicem", "Thank you! I think he would\u2019ve been infinitely better served by \u201cNanny was very sick, and she died because of the sickness\u201d \u2014 which would\u2019ve been true and also way easier to understand at that age. When the kids are older they can talk about suicide and stuff, but I kinda got the sense from this post that he blames the nanny for \u201cchoosing\u201d to die, so that earns a YTA vote inherently.", "Wow this is a really articulate and appropriate way of explaining it.", "I mean...  when my DOG died or old age, I spent the day researching on the internet how to approach the subject with my kid, and my husband and I made a plan and made sure we agreed on how to handle it.\n\nWhen this kid's NANNY (a.k.a part of the close family) died, they just dropped the news on the kid and went on with their day. This is horrible.", "I was a similar age and would think things like \u201cit\u2019d be good to go to sleep and not wake up\u201d or \u201cmaybe if I could just stop existing\u201d\n\nSuicidal ideation at a young age is wild", "Wow, constructive", "Fr. I legit thought it was normal until I was in my teens and learned about passive suicidal ideation.\n\nMajor bomb lmao.", "I agree with most of what you're saying, but I do think it's disingenuous to compare someone's reaction to say, their loved one dying of a  brain aneurysm Vs a suicide. I think it's natural to have a lot more complicated grief surrounding a suicide, and that's fine, although having a victim Blamey attitude to suicide *in general* isn't. I don't know, I just think that suicide has to be one of the most emotionally charged kind of deaths for people to process, and people aren't going to react in the exact same way to if they'd died of a physical illness rather than a mental one. And that's fine.", "It might be controversial, but I think you're allowed to have ugly emotions in response to suicide. Like OP says, you can logically know that depression is a disease and suicidal ideation is not someone's fault, and still feel anger and betrayal on top of sadness. I conceptually know why people do it and have lots of empathy for them, however all the knowledge in the world would make me have a zen, not angry reaction if one of my loved ones committed suicide.\n\nLike there's a massive difference between someone's attitude to suicide in general, in which 'blaming the victim' would be shitty, and having your own raw emotional response to the actions of someone close to you.", "Exactly! And seeing as, for example I grew up in an upper middle class family pre-internet yet was still aware of what suicide was, and still knew people who attempted and succeeded prior to anything but aol and dial up. Kids today are exposed to way more variety of media without censorship. We don\u2019t know what kind of devices and social media OP\u2019s kid has access to. Or the kid\u2019s schoolmates.", "His response goes beyond grief. He said that suicide is \"likely\" caused by mental Illnesses- like he didn't actually believe it was a real thing/problem people have.\n\nI highly doubt any of his attitude is from him caring about her, and more just him being upset their favorite nanny \"selfishly\" killed herself with no thought of him, and what he'd have to do because of it."]}
