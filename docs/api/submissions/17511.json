Your wife was talking to him in child appropriate terms, and you decided to be harsh. Why? He's 7. You have to talk to children in terms they are able to handle at their age. You give them more details as they grow and mature.

It\u2019s worth the investment. \n\nEspecially the way she died.

The mixed messages from your wife and you, though, might arguably be more confusing. \n\nUltimately, a few sessions with a child psychologist might not be the worst thing in the world, and you two might be able to go with him.

I think you should seek out grief counselling for both of your kids, but especially for son.

YTA\n\nI think 7yo is a bit young to have a suicide convo.  And even then \"it was her own choice to die\", isn't terrible accurate.

If someone cannot think of those exceptions, consider yourself lucky).\n\nIf I was your spouse, I would be mad at you, too.

Let kids stay kids, I am not opposed to \"sugar coating\" the harsh bits when they are so young.\n\nAre you afraid your son will grow up too \"soft\"?", "This is a really tough situation but I'm going to say NAH. By 7 a child is likely to know about suicide by hearing people talk about it or reading it on the news. I certainly did from watching the news on TV and hearing my parents talk about Marilyn Monroe's suicide. They were big fans. I remember asking my 2nd grade teacher about the difference between suicide and commit suicide. \n\nIt would have been worse if you lied about how she died. I think the words you used (chose to die) were appropriate.\n\nBut I also understand why your wife wanted to lie to them. Suicide is so stigmatized and hushed and as a result some children really don't know about it by 7, and parents wouldn't want to their first introduction to it to be someone close to them.", "NTA.

It's an incredibly difficult situation to be in and you're doing the best you can. Obviously you had no ill intentions here. But yeah, you should've discussed it with your wife before giving that answer. It's definitely too much for a 7 year old to digest. I still have a hard time processing the suicide of loved ones, as an adult.", "Oh, this breaks my heart for everyone involved but I think you did the right thing. NTA.", "NAH, but you should apologize. Then you and your wife should get on the same page asap and also review some child grief counseling resources.", "NAH. Although I think some well intentioned mistakes were made.\n\nOP, I just want to say that someone I love committed suicide when I was seven. Nobody ever sat me down and explained what death was, or told me that their death was self inflicted, any questions I had were brushed off or I was yelled at for asking. I knew though, I heard the whispered conversations behind closed doors and when I was supposed to be asleep, dug out the death certificate myself, found the note, put the pieces together. I just wanted to know, to understand. Someone I loved was gone and everyone else I loved was suffering, I was so angry that I was being left out of the loop and dismissed as being too young to understand. That people were talking about me in front of my face telling eachother that I didn't need to know, or that I didn't need to know everything, or arguing about the best way to explain it to me. I don't remember ever being told what death was or what it meant, but I remember knowing as soon as I was told what it meant, and being so desperate to understand that I focused on finding that knowledge instead of grieving.\n\nSo, I don't know that there's ever going to be an age appropriate way to explain suicide to a seven year old child, especially when there are so many adults who don't, and will never, understand how it feels to be suicidal. I do know that therapy could have saved me a lot of pain and confusion, having someone to talk to who wasn't grieving, someone to ask the hard questions without fear of hurting them, someone to walk me through my feelings and keep me from feeling so lost. I carried that death with me for a very long time, it was the first experience I had with death other than pets and TV, it was handled terribly because the people in my life were grieving and had no idea how to handle it themselves. It still marks me in some ways. Knowing how they died and why helped me navigate my own mental health decline and eventual suicide attempts as a teenager. It was the reason why I got on meds and why I'm still alive today, because even though I hated myself, I didn't want to make anyone ever feel the way I had felt as a child losing one of my heroes because they were in too much pain to keep going.\n\nI don't know how you worded things, how graphic you were or how softly your wife tried to approach it, I don't know how or if you could have done any better other than talking about how it should be handled before you were both in front of your son trying to handle it completely differently. I do know that if either of you feel like you've made a mistake or not handled it in a way that is helpful for your child, there is no shame in admitting that and asking for professional help. Do the best for your child, because the first time you lose a loved one often informs how you'll deal with grief and loss as you grow up. I hope that your son finds some peace with the loss you've all suffered, and that you as parents find some grace for eachother, you're both flying by the seat of your pants here.", "NTA  - Even though I personally never suffered a loss like this, I had major issues with the idea of death and would lie awake in bed at 8 years old thinking about how I've used up 10% of my life already. I knew there where things adults weren't telling me which meant I couldn't trust what they had to say about it. Creating a safe space for this topic is the best thing you could have done based on my experience.", "YTA, you chose not to have an age appropriate conversation regarding her death.

I can see why telling a child that a young person died for no apparent reason might cause them to worry about losing more loved ones or even make them fear dying at any given time.

You tried going for truth but only left your kid with badly told half truths. Time to have a second talk to find out what kiddo's thinking now", "My uncle killed himself when I was 8 years old. No one told me he died, let alone how. It took me years to figure out and I hate how it was handled. I'd have appreciated knowing. Kids can understand those things.", "ESH because you and your wife need to get on the same page here. But 7 is appropriate to generally explain suicide and not hide the truth. \u201cSometimes people just die even if they\u2019re young\u201d is no less heavy or difficult for a child to come to grips with than explaining suicide. Especially if you can explain the mental illness part of suicide as children can generally understand being sick and illnesses that can cause death. \u201cSometimes healthy young people just die\u201d is terrifying to a child of you think about it.", "YTA. For making the decision without your wife, and for giving \u2018blunt\u2019 answers to someone too young to grasp the complexity of a situation like suicide.", "NTA. If he\u2019s old enough to ask he\u2019s old enough to be told. \n\nSugar coating everything will simply lead to them going to find out in their own. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with saying she chose to die. Because that\u2019s what she did. She chose to commit suicide. \n\nShe was mentally I\u2019ll and chose a way to stop it. It\u2019s a sad way but she still made that choice. \n\n7 is old enough to learn about death.", "ESH. Honesty is important, and death is an important thing to understand now (especially if you live in the states, given the school shooting epidemic). But I definitely think you guys should have talked this over and found a middle ground, and held back a little bit on the delivery. My mom committed suicide at 15 and even then I struggled with the reality of it. The four year old sounds like she\u2019ll be okay but it\u2019s quite possible that your son may end up blaming himself for this.", "You\u2019re not an AH\u2026. But I definitely don\u2019t think you did it right. But I do feel empathy for your situation. Two of my grandparents died right around when my kid was that age, and unfortunately, the questions won\u2019t stop, he still grieves 2/3 years later. My friend also took his own life, but luckily my son doesn\u2019t remember grieving that, just sees me drop things off at his grave. It\u2019s definitely not something I consider telling him any time soon, it\u2019s hard enough for me him to process that people my age can die, so I definitely won\u2019t open that can of worms any time soon. Idk if you can really dial that back, but I definitely suggest you try. This is going to be a LONNNNGGGGG process\u2026and I can\u2019t give you a verdict based on such a tough time. There\u2019s no good guide here, just keep trying your best and lay back on the suicide part.", "YTA. A seven year old can\u2019t really comprehend the concept of suicide. You could have just said she was sick. If he asked what kind of sickness you could have said a mental one. That would still be accurate and not confuse the kid beyond what his capabilities are. Also its messed up you did this without talking to your wife especially since it was very clear she was not in agreement", "Normally I would say nah. But YTA. I have worked with mental health for so long. The one thing I know for absolute sure, is that knowing that someone chose to end their own life, has long and lasting effects on the mental health of those who were close to them. It also greatly increases the chances of that person doing the same. He may only be seven, but that is even more reason to protect him from this harsh and incomprehensible behavior.", "Yeah, this is going to seriously confuse the kid. At that age I would have interpreted \"she chose to die\" as meaning you could just think \"I want to die\" and you would die. Kids don't have the capacity to understand suicide at age 7.", "Agreed. I hope OP gets his son to see a professional and receives therapy as he processes through his grief and confusion.", "I agree with this YTA, it\u2019s way beyond his ability to completely comprehend. and you\u2019re definitely TA for not talking with your wife first!!", "I don't see where op was harsh?", "There are age-appropriate ways to explain mental health and suicide to a child and not make it worse but..\n\nExplain his nanny loved him but most illness is in our bodies, but sometimes it's in a person's mind. There's ways to treat it and take care of people, but you can't see those types of illnesses, so people have to tell us they're not feeling well.\n\nHurting ourselves is never the answer, but sometimes people we love can't see those other answers. It's why we talk to people if we feel anxious and sad. Feeling anxious and sad is normal, everyone feels that way sometimes. But when we almost always feel anxious and sad, we need help from other people. Asking for help when we need it is a good thing.\n\nSometimes, though. People hurt themselves on purpose and they're sick. Sometimes, they hurt themselves a lot and they pass away.\n\nIt's not anyone's fault that someone was sick. It doesn't mean they loved us any less.\n\nKid appropriate explanations exist. Probably best not to hide it because they may find out later, but also explain in gentle terms that yes, she did take her own life and it yes, she did love him. We talk about how we feel. Some sadness is normal. Even sadness for a long time after someone we love is gone. But depression is more than just being sad.\n\nIt should totally, absolutely 100% be discussed before, though.", "I didn\u2019t want to lie by saying she is sick. We don\u2019t know what issues she had.", "To be fair, I\u2019ll bet OPs wife expected him to say mostly the same stuff she\u2019d say. His honesty was a bit too brutal for the situation considering the kid is only 7.", "I am a bit angry she did this to everyone around her including my children who love her. I hadn\u2019t considered I could be taking that out on my kids. Thanks for the perspective.", "She did \u201cchoose\u201d to kill herself any more than someone \u201cchooses\u201d to vomit.

I did want to make sure he knew it was a choice, and a wrong one to make. I do see the point you make. Thanks.", "They would need it from just the fact their primary caregiver died, regardless of what they chose to say or not. 7 is old enough for child appropriate truth, and being vague leaves kids that age to all kind of magical thinking fill in the blanks. Vague statements like, \u201cpeople of all ages can die,\u201d is likely to be much more terrifying and confusing to a young child than telling them some version of \u201cshe was so sad she chose to die.\u201d", "Thank you. I\u2019m confused by all the people saying that 7 year olds couldn\u2019t possibly comprehend suicide. Of course they have young minds and don\u2019t necessarily understand all the nuance, but many of them can probably understand that sometimes people can cause themselves to die. I definitely did at 7", "Receiving many comment like this has convinced me that I went about this the wrong way. I\u2019m afraid I made things worse. We will be having another conversation doubtlessly.", "Google \"how to talk to a seven year old about death\" and look at basically every top result.  The wife handled it correctly.  OP did the direct opposite of what you should do.", "A seven year old likely has no framework of context on how suicide works and there is a much better way to address mental health and suicide than 'chose to die.'\n\nYou need to be prepared to explain what suicide is, depression as a mental illness and explain that there are other options but sometimes people just can't find them and have a very calm talk about it.\n\nIf both parents aren't on board and contradicting each other, it just sounds like the person just... decided to die and keeled over.
