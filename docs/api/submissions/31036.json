{"id": 31036, "submission_id": "17vxqf9", "title": "AITA for not picking up my cousins wife\u2019s packages off the sidewalk everyday?", "selftext": "So a little back story. I lost my job because my car broke down and couldn\u2019t get my hands on another one right away. So my cousin says, come move in with us, of course he\u2019s going to charge me rent which I totally expect and would have given him it regardless of if he requested it or not. We are like brothers. \n\nSo anyways, since moving in I notice his wife gets packages everyday, sometimes multiple. Maybe not everyday, but probably 5-6 days out of a week. I just started working again last week, thankfully was able to get my job back at amazon after quitting with negative time (should have been fired), but I have good work ethic thankfully and they like that. So at amazon I work over night, I am here during the day. \n\nSo normally when I\u2019m home I\u2019m in and out the house during the day a package will get dropped off, most of the time multiple, sometimes different carriers etc, you get it EVERY DAMN DAY. I usually pick it up and bring it inside to the kitchen as you enter the house. So I kinda think to myself \u201cdamn, this is becoming a chore and I\u2019m kinda pissed cause I almost tripped over the packages on the way out. So I decide I\u2019m tired of picking up her packages from the sidewalk in front of the door  everyday (I haven\u2019t had anything ordered to the house once) so I step over it and decide to leave it and she can pick it up when she gets home and bring it inside. \n\nGo to work last night, get a message from my cousin. (Message in photo) well, I can\u2019t post it so here it is:\n\n\u201cShelby is pissed because you were a commen as motherfucker and stepped over her package instead of bringing it inside. She went to sleep bc she was pissed at you. She said since you are petty, she'll be petty and won't cook you dinner no more since you couldn't pick up her package \n\nSo I come home, wait for him to bring it up this morning. He doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t bring it up cause I\u2019m waiting for him to.\n\n\nSo, am I a asshole because I stepped over my cousins wife\u2019s daily order of whatever she got online and didn\u2019t bring it in? \n\n\nNormally I\u2019d say it\u2019s common courtesy to go ahead and pick it up and bring it inside, but not everyday. But to act as if I did something wrong by not picking up your shit you had delivered to the sidewalk?\n\n\n(And the dinner part, I\u2019m thankful but honestly I\u2019m just eating what they\u2019d throw away anyways and prefer not to eat whatever they have)", "created_utc": 1700066687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vxqf9/aita_for_not_picking_up_my_cousins_wifes_packages/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you really are thankful for the things she does that make your day easier (and likely saves you money), then the least you can do is pick up her packages and place them inside.  If you don\u2019t want to help her, then you shouldn\u2019t be accepting help from her.  Even if she weren\u2019t doing any of that, it is just common courtesy for someone you presumably care about on some level.  YTA.", "YTA. \n\nYou live in the house. \nYou see a package.\nYou bring it inside .\n\nSimple.", "YTA. This is legitimately so petty and stupid I am surprised you aren\u2019t embarrassed posting about it on the internet. This is actually high school level crap.", "Dude YTA, pick a better hill to die on.", "YTA\n\nYou must be so imposed upon that as you are walking into THEIR house and you see her package that you should have to bend over and pick it up.  The horror!!!  Dude.... You cousin/brother's getting a package and it costs you nothing/takes no extra time to get and you think this is a hill to die on?  Why are you so angry that this lady is getting packages?  You work at Amazon!!!!  That is literally how they stay in business...sending packages to peoples homes & businesses.  It's not like you have to go out of your way to pick up the package.  So what you did wrong is having this elitist attitude that you need not do any normal acts of kindness.  They close the door every day, but you still seem to find a way to open the door and come in.  Maybe you even make your bed every morning (you should) or brush your teeth.  Just do the little things and don't be petty.", "YTA because not only are you not doing a very simple task, which is just common courtesy, you\u2019re being judgmental of her shopping habits. Especially since she\u2019s been kind enough to cook for you\u2026 ffs. \n\nGet over yourself and act like an adult.", "YTA   \n\nThey offered you a home.  And carrying packages is is a minor daily chore.  They are apparently cooking for you too\u2026 that has to be done \u201cevery damn day\u201d.

You sound incredibly unnapppreciative.  Even if it's every day, it's not that big of a deal to at least put them inside the door.", "Yes YTA. Stepping over the package?!? You are going out of your way to NOT be courteous to the people who brought you into their home when they didnt have to, AND cook for you. Your paying rent doesnt change anything here. Time to grow up bud", "YTA.", "Yes, you already know YTA here. Pick up the damn package if you see it there. They are doing you a favor by letting you crash at their place. I know you pay rent, but it\u2019s still a good arrangement for you. If you don\u2019t want to do it, then move out already.", "Yes, it\u2019s not that hard a task to do", "YTA. Simple as. You don\u2019t just step over parcels outside, quickly put them inside the front door if it\u2019s too much of a chore to put them in the kitchen. She had housed you and fed you.", "YTA. You're part of the household. She does household things for you that don't directly benefit her. If you notice a household chore that needs doing, do it. \n\n\nAlso, you waiting for everyone else to talk to you about stuff isn't you being proactive about clearing the air. It's making others do the work for you. \n\n\nYou're not being a good member of the household. If you don't want to be a member of a household, live alone. If that's not possible right now, step up. It's temporary.", "YTA. I get that it\u2019s annoying, but you\u2019re living in their house, they\u2019re cooking you food, they\u2019re doing you a favour.

Not much to add, you don\u2019t want to be courteous to the people who helped you out in a time of need, then get the fuck out of the house.", "Yta - Amazon didn\u2019t hit eh back cuz ur a good worker they couldn\u2019t care less u came crawling back- they open the home\nTo and if u have to step over it then it\u2019s more work", "YTA\nIt's a package their not asking you to walk a dog or clean their house for them if she can cook you dinner you can get her package in.", "Just pick up the package. Jeez.\n\nESH because your cousin and his wife are too immature to have a proper conversation about this, and you are throwing your toys about picking up a package that you are *literally* walking past.\n\n>I\u2019m just eating what they\u2019d throw away anyways\n\nDo you think that before you moved in, they'd cook too much food every night and then throw it away?\n\n>prefer not to eat whatever they have\n\nHave you offered to cook a couple of nights a week?

If it's not working for you, move out!", "I was all set to say NTA until you said she cooks you dinner every night. So, YTA. She was treating you better than a roommate- dinner is a lot more complicated than bringing a package inside.", "YTA\n\nShe feeds you, dude. Bring the packages inside. If you live somewhere, bring mail and packages inside.", "YTA and it baffles me that you think you are not the AH. You live in her house - it's not just your cousin's house. She cooks you dinner and cleans a house that you contribute to messing up. Picking up a package, or multiple packages, is the *least* you can do. \n\nIf I were her, I wouldn't bother being petty - I would just kick your disrespectful, ungrateful a** out. \n\nYou owe her a big apology. Directly, to her face. You also owe your cousin an apology.", "YTA- these people agreed to have you in their home and support you when you were vulnerable and you can\u2019t be bothered to pick up a parcel.", "YTA. You were even walking in the same direction, it's barely even a bend down. They let you stay in their home!", "Unless she\u2019s building a collection of kettlebells, i don\u2019t get why you think picking up parcels is a chore. YTA", "INFO: Do you take on a larger burden of other chores in the house? Or are you just getting food made for you for free and taking it for granted? While you stated you were thankful, you also said things that indicated the opposite.\n\nYTA unless you\u2019ve already been disproportionately contributing to the house. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019d rate her food 5 stars. You\u2019re eating it. So, even before we get to the greater area of whether a housemate who is home should be expected to pick up someone else\u2019s packages every day, it sounds like there is an imbalance that may have already been building up resentment for her. (Although she should have voiced it earlier if so).\n\nAs someone who often goes out of my way to help others, those others occasionally take kindness and giving for granted and then turn around and show the exact opposite to me. I wonder if that is how she felt. \n\nAs someone who has lived in many group houses, you have to put in more than you feel is your fair share, because each person is inclined to look at the things they do, and not realize or not focus on the things they get from others in the house. It\u2019s just human nature, but it\u2019s some thing to be conscious of. So I always try to think of it as I am probably contributing my equal fair share if I am doing what feels like 150% of my fair share. My housemates do the same.\n\nOf course, the text message you received as a start to a conversation was insulting and inappropriate as a starting point. There is a two-way street here. But if you focus on your side of it, you will be better off for it. \n\nIn your shoes, I would do what I could to reset, perhaps asking if you could all hang out over a meal you\u2019d like to treat to or make yourself for them and talk about it and apologize for taking them for granted. And let them know some thing you like about them in the process, sharing that you care about them and your relationship, and did not intend to create hurt but can see you did.", "You need to move. His wife probably never wanted yiu there and is now getting petty.", "You're right, this would be the nice thing to do but I don't think you're the A-Hole here. You've done it multiple times before, haven't picked it ONCE, and she got mad??? At what?? Again, it's a nice thing to do for someone but it's not your obligation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I hope you can move out soon because living with relatives can sometimes actually destroy your relationship with them.", "NTA - She should be responsible for her own packages, especially if it's becoming a daily occurrence. It's not your job to constantly pick them up for her. Plus, her reaction seems a bit over the top.", "NTA!!! She wants to order so much, she can bring in her own packages. If you were in a hurry, you didn't have time to bring things in all the time. You aren't their servant/door boy.", "NTA. You pay rent, you've brought in her packages multiple times. Seems really stupid for her to get so bent out of shape over it too. Oh boo hoo you didn't pick up her package one time and she gets this pissed about it? If I were you I'd move out asap.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

They offer you a home, a place to live, and she cooks for you. Least you can do is say sure, I\u2019ll get your packages. It\u2019s on the way, too. This is not the hill to die on.", "YTA - you sharing a house, you bring in parcels. Are you buying all your own toilitries, toilet paper etc. My O/H complains I get parcels a lot but he also never notices how many things like pet food, pet litter, light bulbs, medical necessities arrive in brown parcels in a van. You are likely benefitting from those parcels.", "YTA...and a petty one. Just grab the packages. They do a lot for you.", "YTA OP.  Your cousin and his wife were kind enough to let you move in their home with them because you were unemployed at the time and now you are deeming picking up a package or two and placing it inside as a chore ?!   Do you do any other chores around the house?  And to make it sound even worse, you state that you were PO'd because you almost tripped over a package on the way out, which mean that package was near the door and you couldn't even bother to pick up package and place it **inside** (foyer/hallway)?  I mean no one is asking you to walk all the way to the kitchen but damn you could just place it inside so that no one would steal packages.  Then you talk about how you throw out the food that his wife cook.  And you claim that you and your cousin are like brothers, HA!  They should kick your ungrateful butt out instead of his wife not cooking for you anymore.\n\nI'm 61 years old with COPD, Emphysema and Sarcoidosis and I manage to hobble my old, achy, coughing spasms ass down a flight of stairs and back up every other day when packages arrive for my Mom or son and place them in the foyer so that porch package thieves won't steal them.", "\u201cI have a good work ethic\u2026\u201d  Bullshit.  Too lazy to pick up a box, turn around, and put it down inside the door?  YTA.", "YTA\n\nI mean, it sounds like an excessive amount of packages. But if you live communally with people and mail is out, bring it in. It's just common courtesy. ESPECIALLY in a home that's extending a kindness to you. \n\nI think it's an over reaction on their part, but also you're being petty and childish.", "YTA, this is a common courtesy, and takes no effort. You don't have to bring it to the kitchen, just put it in the home behind the locked door. Takes 20seconds and almost no effort.", "YTA You are being so petty and childish. They let you move in with them, she feeds you, and yet you can't do this one thing for her? Grow up.", "YTA, how is picking up a package a hardship? you are petty and pathetic.", "YTA buddy. They helped you stay on feet and not go into massive debt or be homeless. I have a roommate that orders a package at just about the same frequency and I\u2019ll bring them inside every time I see one cause it takes no effort and is the nice thing to do when you live with someone. Yes its annoying sometimes but kindness and generosity is a two way street", "He shouldn't have texted using the language he did, but he was right to be upset.\n\nIt would be one thing if they expected you to go out of your way to check for packages and bring them in, but they were there and you stepped over them. It wouldn't have taken but a second to bend over to pick them up. Even if you are paying rent, it is a kindness for them to help you out. YTA.", "YTA that's so petty. Picking up a package is so minor and she is right-SHE COOKS FOR YOU!! That's a lot more effort than bending over to pick something up. You are ungrateful, and lazy by the sound of things. Starting to see why you were fired.", "YTA. They let you live in their home, and you can't bend over and pick up a package for them? You are petty.", "YTA, you are so lazy you cannot pick up a package and bring it inside. Nice friend.", "Since you are apparently 6 years old, NT...\nWait, you are an actual adult? YTA", "YTA \n\nGo get your own place then smh", "Oh nah, I help. Since I\u2019m home during the day I go ahead and take off all those boxes and trash. I also take care of the yard which happens to be at least one acre worth of cutting/trimming. I pay $600 for a 6x9 room\u2026 not really a room, equivalent to a prison cell. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing. I told her I\u2019m good, I don\u2019t need her to cook for me. They eat really unhealthy, most of the time I\u2019m talking a block of cream cheese goes in about everything. Before this I lived by myself and so I did everything for myself. Most of the time besides a couple things she makes (mainly stuffed shells) I eat what a 8 year old child would eat. \n\nIf I\u2019m being 100% honest. I\u2019ve listened to her cry about my cousins drinking, him not picking up after himself and how she has to do it. I clean up after myself 100%. If I\u2019m right, she\u2019s upset with him as she usually is but taking it out on me instead since she can\u2019t get him to do anything? But in the same sense I pick up after them when I\u2019m here alone too.", "So I am totally baffled by the responses. Maybe I should have included more information. You all seem to think like my cousin is allowing me to live here for free. He approached me about it when I was living on my own. I enjoyed my place by myself. If that was the case, I\u2019d gladly take care of all the house chores and all that. I can cook too, it just seemed to be her thing and she would be upset when I didn\u2019t eat with them, like she took it as a insult. I took over everything my cousin does except for things that have to do with her. Not cause he asked me to, I just did. I clean up after myself always, and pick up whatever they have left in the living room overnight etc. \n\n\nI guess if you become a roommate with someone that automatically makes you their servant and responsible for all their stuff? Also it\u2019s not like we live in the city. We live back in the woods, no one comes back here but the hunt club\u2026 like you don\u2019t come back here unless you live here or hunt here. If you\u2019re car isn\u2019t recognized someone\u2019s gonna say something m. \n\nSo it\u2019s not a, omg I\u2019m worried someone might snatch it. She just expects me to pick it up everyday, I guess cause I did previously and decided to stop. \n\nHere how all this takes place:\nShe buys stuff\nShe opens it\nShe takes empty box to back door and leaves empty boxes. Not broken down, just opens and leaves it. \nThen I take it to the shed.\nOnce or twice a week as needed I go take the trash off. \n\n\nSo I\u2019m responsible for doing everything else with the package besides opening it and possessing/owning it. You guys are real saints, I gotta say.", "So first off I\u2019d like to say I\u2019d like to think of myself as somewhat of a gentlemen. My dad raised me to give a woman a hand if she needs it, and even when she doesn\u2019t as well. \n\nSo my cousin told me to come on and move on in if I wanted to. I obviously did. He brought up some positives about being closer to everything as I lived in the country before about 45 minutes away from Walmart lol. It was brought up along time ago but I was comfortable where I was. Well, my time came and I needed it. He offered again. And well, having $600 towards the mortgage each month \n\nSo the deal is, I pay $600/month for a 9Lx6Width  room. It\u2019s the equivalent to a prison cell. \n\nI\u2019m probably gonna use my cousins truck for a month. We talked, he said $200 and that his insurance payment for his two vehicles each month. At this point I\u2019m seriously thinking about Uber-ing to work until my car is fixed though. \n\nSo of course I say yes. Kinda works out for both of us, plus I\u2019m gonna clean it up real nice before he takes it back like I was raised to do. Shit, in the past I\u2019ve come over here and washed their cars too. They didn\u2019t ask if I would, I asked if they cared if I washed mine and they said nah so I went ahead and washed both of theirs too. At the time their road was dirt, so cars were always dirty and I was able to do something nice for both of them and gain a little instant gratification for myself at the same time by cleaning their cars too. Anyways\u2026 \n\nSo $600/month - $200 for truck rental we will call it. (I can rent a Toyota Camry for $400/month if need be thanks to my amazon discounts.) so it\u2019s like, I save $200 get what I need, he saves $200 by allowing me to drive his truck back and fourth to work, or to the store. No joy riding, cause if someone borrowed mine I wouldn\u2019t want them to really, so I expect the same from myself as I do from others. \n\nSo I cut the grass and take the trash off once or twice a week as needed. Lotta grass, can send pictures if you want. Also got it looking too bitch for what it is because I use to do landscaping. Didn\u2019t spend money on it, neither did they, just looks nice to have a clean and cut yard with hills out on the country. When I say trash, it also is Including the boxes she gets everyday. So I work at amazon (not a big deal but lol) when I get home from sorting packages all night, I help with house chores. In the past I\u2019ve told her leave the dishes, and I\u2019ll take care of them in the morning since I\u2019ll be here. Now I leave during dinner time so she usually does them. She cooked dinner, I ate for free at one point so hey, if I\u2019m eating for free I definitely don\u2019t mind, in fact you should expect me to at least offer. I was planning to get them three $100 gift cards (didn\u2019t tell them) to three different places I know they really like to eat, but now I really feel some type of way about everything. \n\nSo, basically I took over all my cousins house chores that he did previously, pay $600 for a room the same measurements as a prison cell besides the angled wall near the toilet. \n\nThe only thing they\u2019ve really done for me is dinner. I did other random stuff while I was out of work to support myself for anything else I needed. My cousins wanted me to move in from the start I decided against it. I\u2019m paying rent. I asked my cousin about the first month, and his reply was if you end up having some extra money just throw us something even though I discussed I fully intend on paying for the first month. \n\n\nYou ever had a micro manager? That\u2019s what it feels like with her. The minute I do one little thing she doesn\u2019t like, she\u2019s there in waiting. And when I say that, my cousin sent me the video of me stepping around the package. \n\nSo I do feel like I do my fair share, really more than I feel like I should because I do everything my cousin was responsible before If she\u2019s suppose to take care of the inside and my cousin takes care of the outside. Since I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve taken care of the outside, including changing the oils in the vehicles with him. Also this is all stuff I did when I visited as well as I came over here every weekend. I came over when I had my own place and cut his grass just because I enjoyed it. He didn\u2019t owe me anything because of it. I know he\u2019s gone a lot cause his commute and he\u2019s like my brother so, and if someone did it for me I wouldn\u2019t mind. \n\nHe has even told her, \u201cif you need him to do anything just ask, he\u2019s literally done everything I\u2019ve asked him to\u201d she never asked if I could get her packages. I just did it to be kind at first but it\u2019s not my responsibility, and since it\u2019s everyday it\u2019s become a chore. Albeit a simple one, but one I should not be responsible for. \n\n\nI feel like if I grab the stuff then good for me for doing something simple and nice. If I don\u2019t, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. At least not enough to bitch about. I\u2019m not her husband, I\u2019m not her boyfriend, I\u2019m not her servant. If shoes were on the other feet, and I were my cousin my reply would be \u201cwhy are you mad he didn\u2019t pick up your packages? If it\u2019s really that big of a deal kick them to the side and I\u2019ll grab them when I get home\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t something heavy. It wasn\u2019t raining, or other bad conditions. \n\nNow if she had said. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got a laptop coming from amazon. If you\u2019re awake when they come could you please go outside and grab it so it isn\u2019t sitting outside in the cold all day?\u201d Sure I gotcha, but for it to be my responsibility to pick up your packages that you have delivered on a regular basis?\n\n\nAn example:\nMe and my cousin take her car to go get food. It\u2019s the easiest to drive, she gave me the key. I\u2019m riding in her car at night time, my cousins like wtf. I can\u2019t see shit so I\u2019m bitching about it. His response was , \u201cWHY DONT YOU CLEAN IT THEN?!\u201d My response,  \u201cI thought you were her husband.\u201d Idk about you, but I\u2019m gonna keep my girlfriend/wife\u2019s car clean so she\u2019s comfortable and safe each time she gets in it hopefully. \n\nIt\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m suppose to take care of the house and yard and everything even though I\u2019m renting a room at a house they live in too. \n\nI also power washed the house. My cousin did one side, ran out daylight. I finished the rest during the week. \n\nThanks for generating a decent response. Maybe I should have included more details in the original post but felt like it was a long enough read already. \n\n\nSorry I did proof read this, so if I repeated anything, my bad. \n\n\nSo, am I still a asshole or nah?", "And he should move his entitled, unappreciative behind out of their house if it's too much of a chore to place a package that's right outside of the door to just inside of the door.", "Thanks. \n\nIn addition to this she just opens the boxes and leaves them at the back door. Then I end up grabbing it and taking it out to the shed and hauling it to the dump. I use my cousins truck to take it off.", "You don't seem to be acknowledging that she's doing far more to help you than the other way around. Do you know how f*cking annoying it is to have someone else stay in your house for months on end? If they hadn't invited you to move in, where would you be? \n\nIt sounds like this isn't a good match, and you should probably move out ASAP, if moving a parcel inside instead of stepping over it is just too much effort.", "Yea, YTA still because you typed out ALL of that when it would've saved you time and grief to just bring in the damn packages.", "OP should be in a hurry to move out anyways considering he calls living in a room in a house a prison cell...."]}
