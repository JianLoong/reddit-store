It's understandable that you feel disrespected and frustrated by this lack of communication.

You tried many times and she still wasn\u2019t giving the flight information, it\u2019s gonna be her fault so too bad on her", "NTA idk how big your airport is, but all that info is absolutely needed. You gotta know so you can plan what time to leave, and also where to park so you aren't too far away from where they exit, or get their luggage.", "NTA\n\nBut don't wait till tomorrow, decide not to do it right now.", "NTA. She doesn't respect your time enough to even give you basic information. I'd let her know you're no longer able to meet her and let her know whatever the local app is for ride shares.", "_\"I have decided, that if she doesn\u2019t reply to me by the end of tomorrow, I will not be picking her up and I will not offer her an explanation.\"_\n\nCommunicate clearly with your friend. Express to them that despite having the general arrival time that you need/want their exact arrival details now, or you won't be coming for them at all.\n\nYWBTA if you just ghost her without any explanation.
