No? Then shut your trap ordering me to clean the place that I pay rent for.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIdve yelled at her too\n\nFucking. No. \n\nNo to alla this\n\nthis would drive me BANANAS", "If someone that does not technically live in MY home tells me what I should boing or have done by the time they got back, they would have a hard time speaking with their mouth wired shut. That is extremely disrespectful. A strong conversation need to be had with said roommate.", "NTA, I'm sorry he speaks to you like a parent but doesn't live there? I'd be saying I'm sorry, do you pay rent? Pretty sure you're breaking your partners lease being here so much, so pipe down or pay rent before I report you both", "NTA Wow, just wow. How dare that BF go to another person's home & make demands? Entitled much?", "TALK TO YOUR LANDLORD!!! this guy and his enabler need to be gone like yesterday. NTA", "I think you should let your roommate know that they are breaking the lease and if the partner doesn't stop spending 6-7 nights there, you are going to let the landlord know.\n\nThis is your home and not the roommate's partner's. If they want to be together, then they can get their space to rent together.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhat. a. creep. That needs to be the last time he speaks to you like that. As if...", "I think the classic \" who died and left you boss\" would fit in nicely.", "What an entitled deuchebag. Your roommate needs to move out and play house somewhere else", "I interpreted the potential genders the other way around, like it\u2019s a girlfriend agitating because the men her partner lives with aren\u2019t neat enough for her. Maybe that says something about the stereotypes I grew up exposed to. Any combo of genders, the visiting partner is still TA.", "Personally I wouldn't even let my mother speak to me this way.  It's rude & condescending.   Have same respect for others ffs", "I'd be reporting their asses after he spoke to me like that", "\u201cI expect you to be gone when I get back to the apartment I PAY FOR\u201d", "I know, I had to laugh at the edit where they\u2019re \u201csitting down and setting boundaries\u201d like that\u2019ll do anything.

Maybe I\u2019m an AH but fuuuck \u201csitting down and setting boundaries\u201d with a squatting freeloader. Get tf out! Bye. Go pay rent somewhere.", "My neighbor would say, \"And people in Hell want ice water\".", "Exactly. \n\nIf your partner has roommates who don't keep things as clean as you'd like, the answer is to invite your partner to your place, or perhaps find somewhere else completely. \n\nWhether said roommates are all working and/or studying full time and then some, or are unemployed lazy bums gaming the system in order to play video games all day long, is irrelevant. For the simple reason that they are not *your* roommates and thus it's up to your partner to raise the issue, not you.", "NTA. Should have told him to go clean his own home and stay there. During the sit down. Limiting overnight visitors is definitely something that needs to be discussed.", "NTA. I would have told the partner that they are no longer welcome and the rules moving forward will be enforced through the landlord.", "NTA. The thing to remember is that yeah, we could all be a little nicer in certain situations. But we aren\u2019t all perfect and sometimes we hit our limit and freak out a bit. That\u2019s *fine*. You\u2019re human and unlike you, it sounds like your roommate\u2019s partner sounds like a dick all the time. So fuck them. And fuck your roommate for not reigning their partner in when partner was clearly being terrible.", "NTA. The audacity??? please update us on this situation", "Honestly, if they stay there as often as they do, the partner should be cleaning as a thank you! NTA.", "NTA - You were 100% correct in what you told them that, and there was no need to be nice about it.  If he wants it to be cleaner, then he can do it or pay someone else to. And if you guys are paying utilities, he needs to start paying more for his nearly 'every day' guest. Not to mention, if she is there all of the time, that doesn't allow you the freedom to enjoy your space (e.g., walk around in your skivvies, lounge around, etc.).", "You\u2019re better than me..

Don't worry about \"you could've been nicer\" - your roommate's partner never has.  This situation is absurd and I'm glad you'll be setting some guidelines. \n\nAlso - when a roommate has their partner there all the time it just kills the vibe.  As you say, they're not paying for anything but they add to the bills.", "I would tell the room mate, whose bf this is, that YOU *are* a tenant. The bf *is not*. You will no longer be harassed and heranged by this non tenant. I would calmly but pointedly inform them that having their bf over to the extent they are goes against the lease and they could be evicted for it, *if* the landlord finds out and you would *hate* for the landlord to find out, but they will if bf continues or starts any other passive aggressive shlt. NTA", "NTA. I'd double the mess cause fuck that \u201cI expect this to be clean when I get back\u201d annoyed me just reading it.", "Nta and I would have been doing everything in my power to resist swinging on them. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having a sit down\u2026 tell them that a: partner better never speak to you again honestly because I would snap hearing some freeloading lounger\u2019s voice at all, let alone bossing me around in a place where they\u2019re mooching from and b: 2 times a week max or you\u2019re reporting them to the landlord. More than generous because I would be saying 0 nights personally. Increased bills should be redirected to the two of them. If they want to move in, they need to be on the lease.", "NTA \n\nJfc I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Remember that you\u2019re in the right here and hold literally all the power, a quick text to your landlord could shut the whole thing down in minutes, so any discussion you have with your roommate about this is a favor to them. Do not let them push you around because this is your residence and that\u2019s pretty ridiculous honestly", "That \"I expect\" would have had me around the bend in a heartbeat. Partner has no standing for \"expectations\" of any kind!  As long as you are doing your part in the agreed-upon housemate cleaning schedule and not leaving your own kitchen mess for your actual roommates  to deal with when they need to cook....NTA. It's time for the partner to start spending time somewhere else & roommate to start abiding by the lease.", "I once had two roommates that never cleaned. One always had friends over and would use all the dishes in the apartment and leave them dirty. I always cleaned up for them but stopped when I had to scrape chewed gum off a plate. \nAfter I stopped cleaning we ended up with roaches. It was disgusting.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t clean for him, but for yourself. So you have a nice place to come home to. Also it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask him when he got a lease to your place since guests can only visit x amount of times. If he isn\u2019t going to mind his business you shouldn\u2019t mind yours.", "DNTA! Listen if it bothers you so much that the dishes are in the sink, then by golly you are more than welcome to WASH THEM!! And the very next time you say to me \"When I get back\", like your my parent or something, I'm going to unleash on you with the \"power of God's own THUNDER\"!!! Feel Me? Then I'd tell my roommate, look here you betta get yo partner.", "NTA\n\n\u201cI expect this to be clean when I get back\u201d\n\nAre they your parent? No. As long as you aren\u2019t putting the chores on everyone else, your roommate can kick rocks. \n\nAlso, roommates partner? They want to live there, the can pull weight. I\u2019m assuming they are using the toilet, sitting dishes, getting food crumbs places, so why aren\u2019t they assisting?\n\nI hope your meeting with your roommates goes well, and your roommates partner isn\u2019t there.", "NTA. The reason you blew up is because you\u2019ve let them do this for too long before telling them they don\u2019t actually live in the property and it\u2019s none of their business. I\u2019m sure they have their own home they can stay at", "NTA but you need to have a serious conversation with your roommate because his girlfriend should not be staying there as much as she is. She should be paying bills with the amount of time she\u2019s there. Her behavior is absolutely inappropriate and unacceptable. to be honest I think you should tell your roommate that you do not feel comfortable around her and you do not want her around anymore because of her rude and disrespectful behavior and that is extremely rude to be here as much as she was in the first place and she doesn\u2019t live here.", "NTA. If it bothers them so much they can clean the fucking dishes.", "\"I eXpEcT tHiS tO bE clean WhEn I get BaCK\" \nOr what? What are they gonna do, tell the leasing office that you're actively breaking the terms of the lease? Oh wait... \ud83d\ude0f\n\nAlso, NTA.", "I would straight up tell them to leave or pay rent.", "You need to do more than set boundaries.  This person is trying to dominate you in your own home.  \n\nNo new boundaries as much as putting this person in place.  Seems like they owe you for paying their pro rata share for one when two are using the shared expenses.   Also, there's a rule somewhere about disrespecting someone in their own home, even if unwritten.", "I know I'm late, but you're letting this guy establish tenancy at your place.  You're letting him walk all over you.  Stop letting him.  Tell your rm he has to go or you're letting the landlord know.  ESH - you for letting it get to this point.", "Um. You need to get aggressive. Like, a hundred times more aggressive. A comment like theirs should be responded to with expletives at great volume, asking them who they think they are, and directly threatening to report them and your roommate. Perhaps followed by asking what they contribute and whether they think they're pulling their fair share of the weight in their own relationship.", "NTA they don't contribute to the house they don't get a say. It's kind of too late for you but with anyone else in a similar situation never except a situation where a partner is staying over all the time. If they want to live together they can get a place together. Anything else always causes problems.", "You could have been nicer, true.  Then again, it's your home and your roommate's partner has absolutely NO SAY about how your home is maintained. They're not on the lease, they don't pay rent... and if they want the place cleaned, they can do it themself!\n\nDefinitely start setting better boundaries with this person.  NTA, by the way", "Is partner demanding any other roommates clean or just OP? I\u2019m just curious. Doesn\u2019t affect my opinion. NTA", "Yup, they should be cleaning *and* pitching in for utilities.", "I like how OP intentionally left the genders out but we all know exactly what they are. \n\nLet's not pretend like a man would treat another man this way.", "\"I expect you to not come back.\" would be my response,.", "My mom would never, but my dad tries every once in a while to drop the \"I expect...\" line. I think he forgets I'm an adult. I think he also forgets that I have no problem telling him to fuck off.", "A rather demanding and self-entitled freeloader at that.", "My MIL introduced me to \"wish/expect in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills up first\". Fun times!", "Right. Don\u2019t like the cleanliness standards here? Go home. There\u2019s nothing to negotiate beyond that.", "I expect this to be clean when I get back?!!!!!!!!!\n\nNTA. I can\u2019t even put this into words, my brain is stuttering inside from the audacity of this mf. Oh my goodness, don\u2019t let this go OP. This person needs to be put FIRMLY back in their box.", "NTA!!!\n\nWhat a pr***!!!", "NTA whomever the partner thing's they are - they are not!!\n\nF that!! I would have lost it to.", "NTA and hope this means he just booted himself out of your home.", "Kick him out. He gets to make no claims and certainly no demands. He doesn't live there, Walk to the door, open it and whistle for him like a dog to get out.\n\n NTA", "If it bothers partner so much, they can clean. Or shut the fuck up. Either is acceptable. NTA.", "NTA talk to your landlord at this point about the partner over extending his stay.  They have absolutely no business telling you what to do.", "NTA.  Only response to, I expect this to be clean by the time I get back should be, \u201cthen you better put on your cleaning gloves and get your @ss to work.\u201d", "Wait? The partner does not contribute at all and thinks they can talk to you like \u201cI expect this done\u201d. You only did one thing wrong: waited this long to blow up.\nNTA.", "NTA. The partner is way overstepping. Talk to the roomie. If it doesn\u2019t get better then play the \u201cbroken lease\u201d card.  You will then be one the AH but it\u2019ll be deserved.", "NTA - Yeah for sure when living with others the communal spaces should be respected, but the partner has NO place on dictating it, and your flat mate is not your parent! Glad you and other flat mates are sitting and having a conversation to set the boundaries, it should do you all a lot of good.", "NTA! What? Hell no. Tell them they don't live there,they pay nothing. I'd tell them THEY need to wash the dishes if they are so worried about it,they need to earn their keep anyway. How dare they tell you what to do in your own home when they don't even live there!", "NTA\n\nUgh. That\u2019s so sucky. I stay with my own boyfriend 3-4 nights a week, but I\u2019d never dream of telling either of his roommates to clean. I did gently teach one of them how to use the dishwasher, but other than that I have put very little input into how clean or not clean the apartment is. I do dishes sometimes when I\u2019m there, since I contribute to making dirty dishes. \n\nIf she\u2019s staying there and has issues with how clean the apartment is, she should clean it herself. It\u2019s not your issue. You pay for this apartment. She is a guest. It\u2019s none of her business- even more so not her business if she\u2019s not doing anything herself. You\u2019re doing her a favor by letting her stay there. The least she can do is let you live the way you want to live.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBut wow they\u2019re bossy.", "NTA!\n\nTell your roommate this, \u201cThough we lease separately, you are breaking lease. If your partner continues to stay here and tells me how to live my life then I will report you and your partner. This is your only warning.\u201d", "NTA. \nRoomie & her boyfriend are. If she has a problem with how you maintain your shared areas she should tell you. If it\u2019s just her boyfriend, she should reign him in or go stay at his place.", "Haha NTA, the partner is nuts. Boot", "Or literally do to break the roommate and partner up", "Tell him to get his homeless, jobless azz the hell out. You don't live here. You don't pay no bills here. You don't tell me jack snit up in here pal.", "Where did it slip about their genders?", "I love the latter suggestion.", "Trying to get into the middle of someone else's relationship is a bad idea, and usually doesn't end well.  \n\n\nStill, one would hope that roommate has enough common sense to see what's going on, and ditch partner on their own; since partner seems like nothing but trouble. Doesn't seem to be the case here though.", "The partner and roommate should both be cleaning along with paying more for utilities. If they don't like it, you'll report them to the landlord.", "Or it could be an older couple and OP is significantly younger.", "This. In my original commented, I pointed out the one thing OP did wrong: tolerating it at all.", "Great response.", "And then there's my former co-worker's \"Are you high or just stupid?\"", "Hahaha Mum says thanks - she's chuffed that the internet thinks so highly of her, and that she'll \"get to be carried round by a young spunk one last time before I fall off me perch\""]}
