Perfect, no notes.", "NTA\n\ni\u2019m 18 so i don\u2019t really know much about all this adult stuff, but to me sending letters to a dead person seems pretty ridiculous, and understandable that it would hurt you. \n\ni wouldn\u2019t worry about it, i don\u2019t really have a problem with someone sticking it to a mortgage company.", "NTA. They are being ridiculous and, frankly, rude AF, so you responded in kind. Well done.", "NTA, it\u2019s very funny!", "NTA Most people working in a public facing role are taught to update their systems so that deceased people do not receive mail addressed to them. Speak with your lawyer. In my country there are numerous things that you could do to get out of this debt and maybe even keep the house.", "NTA.\n\nI wish I had thought of this when my Granddad died and my Grandma kept getting bills and letters addressed to him, despite everywhere being properly notified of his passing. It would've given her a good laugh. \n\nI'm gonna file this away for future use (hopefully really far in the future).", "NTA. You were compliant for three years while you were grieving a terrible loss. They are the ones who are blatantly ignoring the information you gave them. Sometimes you need to send a message. And sometimes that involves a Ouija board. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your husband. If you were as witty and fun throughout your marriage as you were with sending the Ouija board, I\u2019m sure you two had many wonderful years together. You are a legend, OP. I applaud you.", "NTA Next time, send them the climactic speech from the dead parrot sketch with the appropriate terms changed, too.", "NTA, mortgage companies are AWFUL to people who can't pay for whatever reason. They are supposed to give you opportunities to get right, but if they actually do, they intentionally make it so hard that most people don't ever get the paperwork completed. If it was me, I'd move out and let them have the house. Or just block their number and stay until they foreclose.", "NTA I bow to you. And I wish I\u2019d done this when my parents died and the water company wanted everything but a picture of their corpses to stop service.", "If you are not on the loan, you\u2019re not liable\u2026right?

Good job.", "NTA- They should have something on file notice of death and all that stuff which his death certificate (sorry I don't know if that the right term).

His estate does.", "> Here\u2019s the deal they both both held a mortgage. \n\nOP isn't on the loan.", "Well she wasn't on the loan which is why they can't work with her.  She would have to qualify for a new loan which she obviously can't.", "I agree and that's why I'm selling. They will get paid.

The agent is an AH for harassing her, not allowing her to fix the issue or ceasing the letters!", "Why?", "Why?", "You can not be on the mortgage but still be on the deed.  In that case they can't refinance,  she'd have to qualify on just her income for that mortgage. Obviously she wouldn't qualify.", "NTA and I applaud your ingenuity :)", "Just as an education opportunity, the process here should be the probate court either reads the will or if there is no will just assigns an executor who then notifies the creditors and manages all of these details.  Usually that executor is the surviving spouse.  Once officially notified, the creditors should be communicating directly with the executor.  Things like real estate can't be sold without legal authority and if the sole person on the mortgage is deceased, only an executor acknowledged by the court can perform the sale.", "I'm so sorry about your husband passing.  I was young when my dad died and I hated seeing his much pain my mom was in.  I felt bad that she had to take care of me on too of everything else but she has always been an amazing mother.  Sorry for rambling about my life there.  I just wanted to say sorry.", "> Most people are terrified if Ouija boards\n\n\"Most people\"? They sell Ouija boards in the board game aisle. Monopoly is scarier. A few people get silly about them, but...", "Ok. I missed that. So either now she owns the house and owes the money or she\u2019s a squatter. Which is better?", "Perfectly understandable. Which is why you should send them a letter. Assuming you're in the USA, the relevant law is the FDCPA and it says you should send a letter in this situation.  You're dealing with a giant computer, those letters and just going to get churned out.", "She owns the house", "agreed but they can keep sending them letters, until OP exercises her rights until the FDCPA", "You can collect from their heirs. If OP was the only other one on the deed, this is all her now.", "I didn't say it was her fault but the proper way to get a debt collector to stop contacting you is to send a letter certified mail.", "And it\u2019s not the banks either.  She owes", "I get that 100%. But the printer at the mortgage company doesn't care. I was giving the OP advice on the best way to get the letters and calls to stop.", "Okay.  I'm missing the problem.  If she is free and clear of the obligation, why engage the mortgage company at all?", "That's because monopoly is based on our reality.", "She's literally trying to pay. Her grievance is the letter being addressed to her dead husband. Not that she has to pay.", "Actually they can address it to the estate. I used to work in a bank and we had human decency.", "Let's say she's on the deed.  If the loan balance is $150,000 and house is worth $250,000 she can keep the difference.  If she just let's them foreclose,  usually any profit above loan balance goes to borrower but he's dead. They'd probably auction it off or sell for less which would result in less profit and  go to his estate which if he didn't have a will would cost her more money to collect."]}
