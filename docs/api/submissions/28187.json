But I learned a lot about the culture as well; I was really interested in everything native, although living in Central Europe. I to this day don't interpret it as some \"cultural appropriating\", I was really interested. \n\nBut for you, a US citizen with Mexican roots, calling you inappropriate for choosing a Mariachi costume for your girl, that's ridiculous.

The fact that somebody (who I\u2019m assuming is White?) is genuinely trying to police your connection to your own culture is absurd and awkward at best, and could probably cross into racist territory if she is genuinely trying to lecture you about how you\u2019re allowed to embrace YOUR OWN heritage. It seems that the other POC in the group obviously understand this and tried to politely educate her about how appropriation vs appreciation work, which I must admit was handled more patiently than I would have, but nonetheless she appears to be regurgitating \u201cappropriation\u201d as a buzz word in an attempt to appear virtuous and progressive and it ironically exposed her ignorance and lack of understanding about this dynamic. Saying that you \u201cganged up on her\u201d is inaccurate if it was simply a case of 3-4 POC agreeing and understanding that, while appropriation can be a huge problem with very negative consequences for marginalized groups, this fortunately was not a case of appropriation, then she needs to get a handle on her own feelings and not manipulate and bully you into apologizing because she thought she would be commended for what she said but actually ended up making a fool of herself.
