This point total can give the shopper various earning opportunities and can just as easily take them away or even shut the account down. Instacart is one of the most lucrative app-based jobs out there and your shopper is a person who can make mistakes on the job the same way anyone else can. Instacart shoppers can be juggling up to 3 or 4 batches of orders at one time and it is not always easy to keep the bags straight. At the very least, your shopper tried to take immediate responsibility  by contacting you directly to rectify his mistake so that it didn't have to escalate to a corporate level.

You have not only cost someone higher earning opportunities, but also a job or even a sole source of income for an estimated extra $80 worth of additional groceries (that are needed by someone else!)\n\n\nFor those of you in the comments sections saying that instacart is not a career or putting the word career  in quotes, you need to take a serious look at how privileged your lives are because between myself (in the past) and plenty of other people it is the only source of income to pay rent, bills, etc.", "YTA.

Because I've had Instacart delivery people try to screw me on my order frequently.  The last one that tried it had $38 worth of the most expensive food in my order in a bag in their car until I made them go back and find it.

I let the family kids that were visiting me crack open the chips and sodas immediately and start snacking while I put my groceries away. If you're curious, the brands I ordered were big name brands, so the kids were eating original Lay's, drinking Sprite, and getting ready to crack open Ballpark franks, which I'm sure everyone else was also ordering to prep for their own respective BBQ. \n\nAfter MAYBE 3 minutes, the delivery lady started banging on my door. She explained that there was a mix up, then got angry with me when I told her that 1) I couldn't give the groceries back due to Instacart's policy (this boondoggle has happened to me before) and 2) I SUPER couldn't give them back since some of the food was already opened. (When I checked my security cam later, I saw that she had dropped off the food, stood by her car for a bit while looking at her phone, then came right back.)\n\nShe tried starting an argument right there on my porch, adamant that I give back what wasn't opened and then someone else would bring my correct order. She was baffled as to why I'd let the kids start eating before \"making sure I got the correct order\", and when I tried explaining that everything seemed correct at first (naturally, things like chips and hot dog buns were on the tops of the bags, boxes of soda weren't in any bags, and the rest of what I ordered was common foods like eggs and peanut butter), she just got more frustrated, stating that I should have done \"the responsible thing\" and checked every single bag and every single item before letting the children eat. \n\nI tried deescalating (I didn't want young kids being upset or scared by two grown ups arguing), and when that didn't work, I just said something like \"let me call customer service and we can work something out together\". \n\nShe completely changed her tune, very quickly unloaded my order (which was in HER trunk already) and let me keep both orders. She drove of a lot faster than she should have (I live in one of those windy-street-to-make-you-drive-slow-with-lots-of-posted-speed-limit-signs-suburbs), which makes me think she might have been banking on getting free food by intentionally \"confusing the order\". \n\nOh well. Got tons of goodies I didn't have to pay for that were identical to what I ordered anyway, plus fun extras like cheesy brats. I'd have been totally fine with helping out my fellow human and letting her take free chow for the sake of getting free chow, but she kept dancing around calling me dumb and irresponsible while shooting nasty looks at a gaggle of frightened kids (who now felt guilty for snacking on chips, which I cannot abide; no food shaming children in my presence).
