That was where I proposed \"pops\" and he agreed to that initially. Last night was the first inclination I have had that he wasn't happy about it.\n\nI get a good feeling that he just doesn't understand, because when he describes it, (my being uncomfortable calling him \"dad\"), he tends to roll his eyes, use hand gestures and use words like \"it's a problem for you, or whatever\". It feels condescending and like he doesn't see the validity in my feelings.\n\nTo be completely honest, the label has so many negative connotations for me, that it feels almost like an insult considering how much I do care for and love him. To me, he deserves something special between the two of us. I was hoping that Pops could be that and bring us closer.", "he wasnt being polite he was whining"]}
