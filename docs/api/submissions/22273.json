Parents (F77, M78) had work here and there, nothing substantial. I am, the largest earner, of my siblings. At 18 I purchased the property my parents are living on, and have sent them money each month ever since, to make sure they could make ends meet, and I cover all property and house maintenance. Now, to be absolutely clear, my parents own the mobile home/house on the property, I only own the land. \n     So, for years, whenever anything gives up the ghost I replace it with new... ie. stove/ranges, water heaters, pressure tanks for the well water to the house, burst pipes, kitchen appliances, electrical problems, basically anything that happens to go wrong, I get it fixed, even though I do not own the house. I have been having a LOT of repairs done to their house this past month and their truck died this week, and I bought them another one, as they couldn't afford one.\n     Here is where I get into \"AITA...\" ....\nI walked into my parents' house to hear my father on speaker phone, talking about all the expensive repairs HE'S s having done on HIS property, how HE bought a truck this week, how HE is doing the wellhead work and installing the new pressure pump on the mobile home, and that it is costing HIM an \"arm-and-a-leg\"... I got angry, and I don't know why it made me angry but it did... I loudly stated \"The property is mine, the house is yours, and for the record, I am the one paying for all of the work, not you.\" The truck's \"not costing you a dime.\" I then put the groceries I had bought them, on the table, and turned around and left the house. \n    I have known for years that they don't tell people, other than my siblings, what I do for them, so I don't know why I got angry.\n    For the record...I DO NOT BEGRUDGE my parents the money I spend on their house, nor the fixing of things that are not part of the land. Nor am I ever upset that my siblings do not, or can not, help my parents financially. I am however ANGRY that I heard my father blatantly lie.\n    Now, my parents are angry that their friend heard what I said. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689380218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zwqwr/aita_for_buying_a_truck_and_expecting_parents_to/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You stood up for yourself and told people the truth. Your father was invalidating your work just so he could brag to his friend about\u2026 how much money he was spending?

You should be angry. That would be enough for me to set a strict budget and no more spending willy nilly. I wouldn\u2019t have enabled this kind of thing for as long as it\u2019s been going anyway.

NTA for being angry about them lying", "You're not an AH but you knew that they didn't tell other people about you paying for things so you kinda have to understand why your parents are upset.\nI'm sure they could have not said you paid for things without saying how it's costing them so much though!", "Why on earth have you been doing this for nearly 30 years? Why can they not support themselves?\n\nEdit: 30 years\n\nGeez", "NTA your parents are lying to people. Why do they need to say who is or how much is paid for it? If they don\u2019t want people knowing your supporting them then just don\u2019t tell people anything.", "I'm not sure I'd want anyone to know if I provided so much monetary support to my parents. That kind of news gets around fast. You may start getting a lot of money requests.", "As far as division of estate...They only have the mobile home, and it can't be moved, no axles, and on a permanent foundation...my siblings won't want it, so they've said in writing and gave me the copies just in case. Idk what my parents plan for the furniture.... I don't think I want it. My siblings help by way of physical labor when I need them to, they just can't help them financially. Parents are on Social Security, combined at about $1700/m", "Yes. I may have to delve into my anger, and figure out why I got angry. Until now, I don't think it ever bothered me...as this was the only time I have said anything. I'm not sure I've ever even THOUGHT about it, until today.", "I think I might be the AH for saying anything while they were on speaker phone. I'm not defending myself, I said it, and I knew they were on the phone. They are very upset. I don't blame them. I also feel a deep need to take care of them, so I don't know why I got angry, when it has never bothered me before .... And if it has bothered me, I did not realize it.", "True. Most of my close family knows my personal situation, I don't talk about any of this with friends or anyone really. Not one person has ever asked for help, not one. I don't advertise it, to the public. Maybe I shouldn't have posted as myself. I just had to explain what happened and what I said, to get it off my chest and find out if I should apologize for being an AH. I felt like an AH this afternoon.", "I would imagine because it feels like your father is dismissing or devaluing your help. You're supporting both of them, yet it's not even acknowledged; even hidden from other people. I would be hurt in your position.", "Hon, you didn\u2019t realize you were angry because you were internalizing it. The fact that their child is earning so much and yet taking the time to take care of them should be a source of pride for them. Instead, they hide it away like it\u2019s some scandalous affair? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re expecting a parade in your honor for helping them but they should at least own up to how much you help them out.", "I don't think I've ever actually HEARD the stories they tell to explain all the workers and stuff. The lies are from not wanting to admit they need the help, perhaps. Or pride, or something. You're right, I think I just wanted validation, or possibly to hear that their daughter is improving their lives. Idk. Maybe I need therapy. LoL Either way I should not have embarrassed them on the speaker phone. I should have sat down and had a conversation.", "NTA. but man, this is tough.  as a person who also have to deal with difficult parents and at the same time have to take care of them, i understand your pain.  hearing what you heard must be tough.  if it was me, i would feel like i wasn\u2019t appreciated and all the things i HAD to do was not necessary.  it would be a spit in the face.  yeah, like i said, i understand your pain quite well.  and i know what you want too.  occasional recognitions and some thank you.  \u2026 sigh.", "Honestly, I spent some time crying, and trying to figure out why I was angry. Maybe I just need a hug and pat on the back once in a blue moon. Yes, I believe you completely understand. Sometimes, I feel they need more than I can emotionally give. It takes a huge toll on those of us, that are caregivers.", "Yeah it would be worth it to you to examine where that came from. Why you need to have them publically acknowledge the support.\n\nIt might also be worth getting curious about pride and the way your father sees himself. It might be hard for him to admit that he is not independent, especially if that's part of his self-story.\n\nJust see if curiosity about yourself and him might be doorway towards building a better relationship.", "The issue here is that your dad seems to be manipulating his friends and who knows who else regarding the sacrifice you have been making. He could have not brought up the financial stuff at all or just changed subject\u2026but engaging in it seems to make him feel like a big man because he can posture about paying the bills. It could be that they are embarrassed they aren\u2019t paying and especially he is considering how men tend to build their identities on their ability to provide. I don\u2019t think youre the asshole but I do think you have an opportunity to discuss why this bothers you.\n\nEdit: Who gives a **** what dude on the phone thinks? The most important people are those in the room\u2026you and your parents. They seem to have a common problem of being more worried about what other people think than clearing up problems with the people closest to them. It would be nice if your parents could get those priorities straight. It make me wonder if this has been an ongoing form of emotional neglect\u2026which could result in the resentment you are experiencing now.", "LMFAO at \u201cI DO NOT BEGRUDGE\u2026\u201d-yes, you absolutely do, or you\u2019d not have behaved as you did. You\u2019re NTA-but only because you are caring for your parents. Your behavior was certainly that of an asshole-though you seem extremely petty, at the very least. Have you ever thought that your dad was saying \u201cI\u2019m having such and such done\u201d rather than saying \u201cmy son John is paying for this\u201d because it\u2019s a matter of pride? Perhaps he\u2019s embarrassed that he can\u2019t do it himself. You didn\u2019t need to scream all of that out right then, if it bothered you that much you could\u2019ve handled it like a grown up and spoken to him privately about it after he got off the phone. Way to make your dad feel less than.", "Hug through the ether.  You can have the conversation with them about why you reacted the way you did after you figure out why yourself.  Your dad has pride issues, try to see why he lied, and be delicate with everyone including yourself.", ">Your behavior was certainly that of an asshole-though you seem extremely petty, at the very least. \n\n\n\nBullshit. \nIf the parents are doing it, they get to praise themselves. \n\n\n\n\n>Have you ever thought that your dad was saying \u201cI\u2019m having such and such done\u201d rather than saying \u201cmy son John is paying for this\u201d because it\u2019s a matter of pride? \nPerhaps he\u2019s embarrassed that he can\u2019t do it himself\n\n\n\n\nIf he isn't too prideful to take Op's help and money, he has no business being embarrassed.

If your father is embarrassed at being caught in a lie, then he shouldn't have told such large and outrageous lies in the first place. Don't beat yourself up."]}
