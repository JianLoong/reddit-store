We left right after Christmas day. After like 150km I (41F) asked if we could break for toilet. I guess I could drink less before a long trip but I don\u2019t want to risk dehydration either, it gives me bad headache. Well my husband asked me \u201dDo we really need to stop?\u201d and kind of brushed me off. Later my husband told I should have insisted, but I was too shocked at that point, I never had to beg for a toilet break before in my life. He later said he didn\u2019t want to let pass those other drivers he had passed on the way. I also told my husbabd I could not sleep well at his sister\u2019s place because the walls are paper thin and my husband and his sister were drinking and catching up until 4am on both days we were staying. I did not want to interrupt them, they only meet each other so few times a year. But I just can\u2019t sleep if someone\u2019s talking and earplugs press my ears when sleeping.\n\nThis year he wants to go again but I said I will stay home and rest. I like sleeping and peeing so I don\u2019t want to go. I could take a train and stay in a hotel but the whole point of me going is to keep my husband company in the car and hand him sandwiches so he can eat without stopping.\n\nMy husband is now sulking because I \u201ddon\u2019t want to go anywhere with him, and I don\u2019t want to do things as a family and that I\u2019m being difficult\u201d. I\u2019d go if we stopped when I ask to but that\u2019s not going to happen. When I asked he got angry and said he could drive 1000km without a toilet break so he\u2019s still not willing to have a toilet break for me. He\u2019s perfectly capable of rational thinking though, he\u2019s just trying to make a point that I should accompany his needs. His needs are as long as possible uninterrupted drive, and me being there to keep him company. But he won\u2019t make any effort to turn the trip tolerable for me.\n\nWIBTA if I stayed at home?", "created_utc": 1667830858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoocq0/wibta_if_i_did_not_go_on_a_trip_with_my_husband/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a gem there.", "Depending on where in the world you are, it might be a long way from a toilet and you have to plan those breaks into the drive. It might be the side of road as much as an actual servo. While I have managed to go for similar distances in one hit when necessary, it's not ideal for the body, and those situations were a bit desperate. You do need to stop at least once on a 600km drive, even if it's just to refuel the car. On this point your husband is wrong.\n\nThe driver needs to accommodate their passengers' needs. The passenger also has responsibilities, and being a sandwich delivery system is a crude way of describing it. It's about being company to stay alert and awake to conditions, being a navigation helper, and yes being in charge of drinks and food/snacks. Being a active passenger on a long drive is important, and he is being rude about it but technically correct. If you are not ready to be an active passenger, that needs to be agreed in advance.\n\nYou are NTA here, as you do not feel comfortable both on the trip and sleeping in your sister's house, and offering to not go is a reasonable solution. That other people might be fine with the conditions is not the point either, as it is your marriage and if can't accommodate your preferences, then he is disrespecting you and can go alone.\n\nHave you tried to suggest that one year your husband drives up to his sister and the next year she drives down to him? Is that feasible with both their work and other responsibilities?", "NTA. Tell him to enjoy the trip and stay a few extra days. And make sure to text him every time you pee, and every time you wake up after a good sleep.", "NTA. Not stopping when you need to use the toilet is abusive AF!\n\n I cannot imagine living like this. When we take driving trips, or any kind of travel really, if either one of us wants to stop to take a piss, grab a bite, take a picture of a pretty tree, whatever, we do so because we respect each other!  And if we don't want to do the same things, we are comfortable enough to be alone. I am so very sorry that you don't have this kind of relationship, OP. Stand your ground!", "NTA\n\nSounds thoroughly unpleasant to ride with him.   I've driven a LOT across Europe.  Serious road trips, such as Trier-Florence, Trier - Roskilde, Kaiserslautern - Vienna, etc... \n\nI did about 90% of the driving.  My husband about 10%.  I have adhd and I'm a terribly bored passenger.   I can't even imagine being trapped as you are. Your husband is being massively inconsiderate.  \n\n\nYou need to stop every 2-3 hours to stretch legs and wake-the-fuck up as a driver!  Its a safety issue. \n\n\nWith fuel prices as high as they are across Europe, why don't you both take the train? He won't be as stressed passing slower vehicles all of the time, especially if he's barely faster than they are.  \n[I've sat behind too many drivers like what he sounds like to be.  He causes a hazard with backups if he does what I suspect he's doing]\n\nBut no way should you get in the vehicle with him.  He can manage his own sandwiches and be a stressed out, obsessed nonstop driver all on his own. \n\n>My husband is now sulking because I \u201ddon\u2019t want to go anywhere with him, and I don\u2019t want to do things as a family and that I\u2019m being difficult\u201d.\n\n\nIf he was willing to treat you like an equal member of the family, then perhaps.  He could prove that he really wants you along by joining you on a train journey.
