We left right after Christmas day. After like 150km I (41F) asked if we could break for toilet. I guess I could drink less before a long trip but I don\u2019t want to risk dehydration either, it gives me bad headache. Well my husband asked me \u201dDo we really need to stop?\u201d and kind of brushed me off. Later my husband told I should have insisted, but I was too shocked at that point, I never had to beg for a toilet break before in my life. He later said he didn\u2019t want to let pass those other drivers he had passed on the way. I also told my husbabd I could not sleep well at his sister\u2019s place because the walls are paper thin and my husband and his sister were drinking and catching up until 4am on both days we were staying. I did not want to interrupt them, they only meet each other so few times a year. But I just can\u2019t sleep if someone\u2019s talking and earplugs press my ears when sleeping.\n\nThis year he wants to go again but I said I will stay home and rest. I like sleeping and peeing so I don\u2019t want to go. I could take a train and stay in a hotel but the whole point of me going is to keep my husband company in the car and hand him sandwiches so he can eat without stopping.\n\nMy husband is now sulking because I \u201ddon\u2019t want to go anywhere with him, and I don\u2019t want to do things as a family and that I\u2019m being difficult\u201d. I\u2019d go if we stopped when I ask to but that\u2019s not going to happen. When I asked he got angry and said he could drive 1000km without a toilet break so he\u2019s still not willing to have a toilet break for me. He\u2019s perfectly capable of rational thinking though, he\u2019s just trying to make a point that I should accompany his needs. His needs are as long as possible uninterrupted drive, and me being there to keep him company. But he won\u2019t make any effort to turn the trip tolerable for me.\n\nWIBTA if I stayed at home?", "created_utc": 1667830858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoocq0/wibta_if_i_did_not_go_on_a_trip_with_my_husband/", "score": 334, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a gem there.", "Depending on where in the world you are, it might be a long way from a toilet and you have to plan those breaks into the drive. It might be the side of road as much as an actual servo. While I have managed to go for similar distances in one hit when necessary, it's not ideal for the body, and those situations were a bit desperate. You do need to stop at least once on a 600km drive, even if it's just to refuel the car. On this point your husband is wrong.\n\nThe driver needs to accommodate their passengers' needs. The passenger also has responsibilities, and being a sandwich delivery system is a crude way of describing it. It's about being company to stay alert and awake to conditions, being a navigation helper, and yes being in charge of drinks and food/snacks. Being a active passenger on a long drive is important, and he is being rude about it but technically correct. If you are not ready to be an active passenger, that needs to be agreed in advance.\n\nYou are NTA here, as you do not feel comfortable both on the trip and sleeping in your sister's house, and offering to not go is a reasonable solution. That other people might be fine with the conditions is not the point either, as it is your marriage and if can't accommodate your preferences, then he is disrespecting you and can go alone.\n\nHave you tried to suggest that one year your husband drives up to his sister and the next year she drives down to him? Is that feasible with both their work and other responsibilities?", "NTA. Tell him to enjoy the trip and stay a few extra days. And make sure to text him every time you pee, and every time you wake up after a good sleep.", "NTA. Not stopping when you need to use the toilet is abusive AF!\n\n I cannot imagine living like this. When we take driving trips, or any kind of travel really, if either one of us wants to stop to take a piss, grab a bite, take a picture of a pretty tree, whatever, we do so because we respect each other!  And if we don't want to do the same things, we are comfortable enough to be alone. I am so very sorry that you don't have this kind of relationship, OP. Stand your ground!", "NTA\n\nSounds thoroughly unpleasant to ride with him.   I've driven a LOT across Europe.  Serious road trips, such as Trier-Florence, Trier - Roskilde, Kaiserslautern - Vienna, etc... \n\nI did about 90% of the driving.  My husband about 10%.  I have adhd and I'm a terribly bored passenger.   I can't even imagine being trapped as you are. Your husband is being massively inconsiderate.  \n\n\nYou need to stop every 2-3 hours to stretch legs and wake-the-fuck up as a driver!  Its a safety issue. \n\n\nWith fuel prices as high as they are across Europe, why don't you both take the train? He won't be as stressed passing slower vehicles all of the time, especially if he's barely faster than they are.  \n[I've sat behind too many drivers like what he sounds like to be.  He causes a hazard with backups if he does what I suspect he's doing]\n\nBut no way should you get in the vehicle with him.

Take a mini vacation where you want to go and he van go live it up with his sister.", "NTA It is a basic human right to be able to relieve yourself when you need to go to the bathroom. The fact that he denied it to you, and said he would prevent you from using the bathroom on a car ride again is abusive and controlling. That would be a deal breaker. You're in the right not going. But what about the future? Are you not going to travel with him anywhere? Is that really how you want to be treated for the rest of your life?", "I like sleeping and peeing too, NTA.", "No.  You WNBTA if you stayed home.  Ugh.  I hate these relationships where people can't function on their own and make demands on their partner.", "NTA. I have intestinal and kidney issues. I bet if he didn\u2019t give you a break and you had an accident he\u2019d turn it back on you, so yeah, don\u2019t travel with him.", "Who doesn't think he is, Jeff Bezos?? \n\nNTA. He must understand that your needs are as important as his.", "NTA the first thing I tell people when going on trips is that we WILL be stopping if someone has to go to the bathroom. My dad would never stop anytime we went on a trip growing up and it absolutely drove me nuts.", "NTA. You are a grown ass adult who gets to decide when she pees. Fuck that noise.", "No NTA. Stay home and enjoy your time. He can figure out how to drive all by his lonesome with his sandwiches considering he's almost 50 years old. I also like peeing and sleeping so I don't blame you for not wanting to go.", "NTA but your husband is a sadist and a verbal bully.", "Hmmm. Think long and hard about what you are to your husband.", "NTA at all. I am like your husband. I'm reasonable, thoughtful and accommodating. Until I get behind the wheel. There's a 9 hr drive I do occasionally. I have done it with no stops at all, but the very most I've done is one 3 minute pee break. The way I'm NOT like your husband is I don't even want anyone to come with me because I know this weird compulsion is really unfair and even impossible for others to deal with. But it's a crazy strong compulsion.", "Good lord your husband is a jerk. NTA", "Nta nope, my dad is also an ahole traveler.  Guess what, no one travels with him now.", "NTA - setting up a boundary does not make you 'difficult'. Asking for a reasonable restroom break is not 'being difficult'. Not wanting to be so dehydrated that you get a headache is not 'being difficult'.\n\nHe is trying to emotionally and mentally manipulate you into going. The no restroom is a strange control thing he wants to hold over you. I would of pissed in a cup/bottle to make a point last trip. Do what is best FOR YOU.", "NTA. 150km is over an hours driving, it's healthy to stop every so often for a break.\n\nShall I lend you my 5 year old? She starts asking \"are we nearly there yet\" after about 30km. Mwa haha", "NTA. Pffftttt....if I am on a road trip with my SO and I ask to stop to pee and they refuse that is the LAST road trip with them. That is completely thoughtless. He can go by himself.", "Stay home!!", "NTA\n\nHolding your pee can cause future incontinence.  So, by not peeing, he's going to leak when he is older and need to wear a diaper.\n\nDehydration can lead to kidney stones and poor kidney function and hypovolemic shock.", "You live in the UK, land of Trains with toilets, I don't know why any of you bother with the M's at all!", "That \"I don't want to let the cars pass me\" is so childish and toxic. Who cares if random strangers are arbitrarily ahead of him on the highway? Does that mean he needs to drive to the end of the highway to make sure he's \"beaten\" everyone? \n\nIs he this childish and competitive in other areas of his life?\n\nNTA", "Off topic, but can I get info on this LARP group? It sounds amazing.", "LOL!!! It actually is amazing. I wish I liked it more. They rent out one of those big country estate homes every year. They hire a chef that only cooks period food, and the props guys worked at the BBC and have tons of access from their contacts there. It's usually pretty damn amazing.\n\n\nI wish I didn't have to do so much gaming for my job, because I would probably really enjoy it if I hadn't. I just got sick of doing it for a job and a vacation.", "It sounds fantastic. I used to do a lot of immersion free-form LARPing, but it was usually a 4-hour thing, not days at a time. I even wrote and produced one several years ago, when I had just moved into a rambling old farmhouse and had the space. I'm in a 1BR apartment now, so that's on hold! I'd love to get back into it, though. And a days-long session sounds really cool! I can see how it would be a lot, though.", "NTA, your husband would hate road tripping with me.  I ask my passenger at every services we pass if they need the toilet or want a snack break.  Have your self a staycation and spoil yourself.", "\u201c I like sleeping and peeing so I don\u2019t want to go\u201d. LMAO", "NTA if you stay home. But you'll be the asshole to yourself if you stay in this marriage without addressing why his desires come before your needs. What you're asking for is literally a bodily necessity. Getting there without stop is \\*not\\* a necessity, so why is that desire coming first?", "NTA. Everyone's covered the pee thing and the childish competitive thing comprehensively. What about stop revive survive? You should be stopping every 2-3 hours for 15min MINIMUM for the driver to have a break and refresh. Tired driving is extremely dangerous. No part of your husband's plans are fair, ok or safe.", "And here I thought my husband was unreasonable because he always wants to stay at his cousin's smoke -filled house and every time I stay there I leave sick. If he had refused to stop when I needed to pee there would have been a story about us on the 11 o'clock news, one way or another.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nSo hes pretty much using you, his wife, as an assistant on this road trip. Don't go, he obviously doesn't care about your thoughts or feelings on this matter. He just wants you to go for his own gain, he has hands he can grab the sandwich himself. You should've pissed on his seats, seriously refusing to stop for the bathroom is kind of psycho. Its takes like 10 minutes at a rest stop tops.", "NTA\n\nSo hes pretty much using you, his wife, as an assistant on this road trip.

Its takes like 10 minutes at a rest stop tops.", "He\u2019s the TA 600km needs at least 3 rest stops for walking and keeping alert let alone comfort stops.  He\u2019s selfish and a road accident waiting to happen.", "NTA my husband always tells me how long he thinks it is to the next pee stop and if I want to go to this one, or the next one. If he refused to stop that would be the last time we would travel together.", "NTA.  Also sitting in a car without moving for extended periods increases your risk of getting blood clots. Getting out every few hours to move is always recommended", "You should accommodate his needs but he won\u2019t allow you a bathroom break on a road trip? NTA but this \u201cI can\u2019t have people pass me who I passed\u201d is borderline OCD behavior. Some therapy is in order for him.", "NTA. I\u2019m lucky if I last two hours. If my husband treated me this way, I would not want to be married to him.", "Don't drive and eating. Crazy", "NTA.  Tell him since you getting bladder infections and headaches is not important to him, his wanting company and being handed sandwiches is not important to you.  If he wants a family trip, then he has to act as a family and that includes stopping when anyone wants or needs to along the way.  As far as the noise complaint, you need to get a noise machine you can bring with you.  It is completely reasonable that they stay up late and talk.", "NTA\n\n>When I asked he got angry and said he could drive 1000km without a   \ntoilet break so he\u2019s still not willing to have a toilet break for me.\n\nThen he can drive 1000 km alone and get his own damn sandwiches.\n\nStay home & relax.", "NTA. Why are you married to this person?", "\"his needs\" \"just wanted something myself\"\n\nNo.\n\nHis wants. He wants to travel in this way. There is no need to. No one is dying. He's not an ambulance.\n\nYou need to urinate. It is a base biological function you cannot control and has health and comfort ramifications if you don't.", "Yeah, that's terrible. When my husband and I first got together he used to spend a weekend in late summer with a bunch of online friends watching his favorite football team at training camp. It was about 150 miles away.  I went, not that I love football or the area was so exciting, but just to go away with him and eat out with his friends and sometimes see a famous football player at the breakfast buffet. Eventually we married and I got pregnant and I was nearly 8 months pregnant for that year's trip. We went, but my husband quickly learned that we had to stop at literally EVERY rest stop on the highway, and he just pulled off without even asking. He's a good guy. Sadly, the team doesn't practice there anymore and it's not so fun to do it in their new complex so the tradition stopped.", "Absolutely NTA. But your husband is! I don\u2019t know how you can put up with this kind of ridiculous behaviour. I think the next time you guys are out for a drive, you should just pull an empty bottle out of your purse and start peeing in it mid-drive, then tell him that he\u2019s right, you don\u2019t need to stop for pee breaks. I have a feeling he\u2019ll be stopping at the next gas station.", "If he gets to be stubborn then so do you. No trips that don't respect your basic bodily functions. Hard line.", "Sitting there in pain because your spouse refuses to stop is not a compromise! That's agreeing to endure 100% unnecessary torture because your spouse is inconsiderate!  Hard pass. You WNBTA. He already was TA, and this is the consequence.", "That's insane! I had two children, so my bladder is no longer iron, but a paper one. I'd start throwing hands in a car if my husband would refuse to stop. Don't go. He can feed himself sandwiches way better than you can hold on pee (which is very unhealthy)", "If you're looking for a larp style event, look into the sca, might be a similar thing.", "What does he do to accompany YOUR needs?  This is a huge ask from him given his previous behaviour.  What do you get in asks in return?", "NTA. This waiting can lead to health issues as well - like UTIs. I would not go either! This sounds like abuse not a fun trip!", "NTA, but you should be willing to go if he's willing to compromise (pee breaks, being quieter at night).", "NTA the job of the passengers is to help the driver if they need something so they can drive safely. The job of the driver is to get there safely and let passengers know there's a rest stop and find out if anyone needs to stop. I've instilled these jobs in my adult children. They're good roadtrip partners. Your husband needs to learn his job of he's insisting on being the driver. Can you both just take the train and spend some time together away?", "NTA \n\nWomen are prone to UTIs, which can be caused by holding it for too long. Your husband doesn't seem to care about you at all. Don't go. You'll have way more fun.", "NTA.  Not stopping to pee when you need to can be bad for your health.  And that's just.... a strangely controlling hill to die on.  He's a big boy, he can get his own sandwiches.", "NTA holding your pee can literally cause medical emergency\u2019s if not at the very least a nasty and painful UTI.", "NTA\n\nI L-O-V-E roadtrips! But here, you aren't a guest, or a passenger, or even a respected partner on a roadtrip. It sounds more like you're a hostage or a teammate on military drill. \n\nIs he so inflexible the rest of year? If so, the relationship sounds quite grueling and unbalanced.", "You are NTA. Your husband, on the other hand\u2026\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how long he can go without a toilet break. You can\u2019t, and you\u2019re more likely to get UTIs than he is. He cannot demand that your biology changes on his say-so.\n\nHe should not demand that you risk your health because he does not want to stop for a toilet break. \n\nHe\u2019s supposed to be a loving partner, yet he cannot do a small thing to make you comfortable. \n\nLast but by no means least, nobody can concentrate for 6-8 h in one go. Ideally, drivers should stop ever 2h; 4 at a maximum. He\u2019s risk  in no his own life, yours, and the lives of other road users because he\u2019s too proud got pee breaks? WTF?\n\n(The excitedly talking with rarely seen sister I could just about forgive, though I\u2019d expect \u2018we\u2019ll try to keep it down\u2019. The rest? Nope.)", "NTA \n\nI have been married to someone like this. Set those boundaries now, or you will regret it later. \n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA \n\nstay home. hes not being fair.", "NTA. One of my more..unhappy memories of my dad is him refusing to stop for a restroom break.  I asked several times and he just ignored me.  I was in physical pain. It's always been a running joke about my need to use the restroom so much but turned out I had a medical reason for it (ultra sound showed a smaller than usual bladder but I also had tumors that were impacting it as well). I'm 50 and to this day (20 some odd years later) I still remember this and it still makes me angry.  If I'm driving and someone needs to pee we stop. I don't care if we just stopped, I'll never put someone through that. I stopped dying family trips due to this if I wasn't the one driving.", "NTA. What happens if you stop to pee and the people you passed on the road drive by? Literally nothing. There are no medals for \"making good time\" or for arriving 2.5 minutes earlier than you might have otherwise. And me? I refuse to travel anywhere i can't get my own space (hotel or apt). Fortunately my hubs like his personal time in the bathroom and likes it when we have our privacy too. But i always travel with ear plugs (the soft foamy kind) and this can make a world of difference no matter where you stay.", "NTA. But if his family home is noisy why don\u2019t you and he stay in a local hotel or B&B?  Also he needs to apologize for the pee issues.", "NTA but if he\u2019s driving his car bring a change of clothes and just piss on the seat, you won\u2019t have to ask him again to stop", "If it's in Canada and mostly highway ,it's a 5 to 7 hour drive , our highways usually 100 / 110 km max speed ( more or less 60 mph ).", "My husband used to do a lot of long distance driving and would think nothing of driving 1500k without stopping.  Then he had a pulmonary embolism and it nearly killed him.  He had to change his job and now all long journeys are broken up so we can stop for a bit of a move around (& a loo break) as moving around helps.  Your husband is risking his health.  The same with UTI's & kidney infections by holding his pee for too long. He isn't doing himself any favours.", "His stubbornness would ensure that he is making the drive alone.  Brothers and sisters need to bond. I miss my brother everyday.  They sound like a rowdy pair. You need to stay home and let him enjoy his sibling time.", "\\*wants. You were literally subjugating your needs to his wants. He is incredibly selfish in this regard. Don't put your health at risk for his weirdly competitive road trip issues.\n\nHope he enjoys having an enlarged prostate, because that's what he's headed for, if he keeps holding his urine in for 600 km.", "Just so you know, you can get a raging urinary tract infection from holding in your pee, or a bladder infection, pelvic floor problems, or even kidney problems. Holding in your pee is bad for you. Just google it, because it's sobering. Not just for women, but for men, too.", ".. replace stretch with doormat.\n\nOK, I get it, I have been dating/engaged/married for (eek!) 32 years and there has had to be compromise on both sides, and yes it has sometimes lead to arguments with Raised Voices. \n\nBut also my beloved has learned I have a bladder the size of a walnut and pee breaks are mandatory and planned in advance lest their be Very Unhappy Incidents! and wives (>.<) and yes there have been problems when stuck in traffic and no one wants that Ever Again!", "The question you should be asking yourself is, \"Is he a loving spouse?\" Are his actions consistent with showing you love and compromise in other areas, or is it always his way or the highway?", "That's even more ridiculous that there's plenty of places to stop!", "I was a member for years. :) My LARPs are not that type. I prefer mysteries or horror scenarios. But English Country House adventures sound fun, too."]}
