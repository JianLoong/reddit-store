I wouldn't call them my close friends, but I follow people who I would consider as friends or have chill vibes.    \nAmong them, \"Jason\" was calling me out for making him look bad because apparently I posted a photo of him in an anti-lgbt protest which was seen by over 1000 students.

I went. His GF broke up with him over the weekend because of the photo, and more people have been avoiding him lately. And he said it was all my fault.

Not my fault everyone doesn't want to associate with a homophobe, right? How is it my fault?.    \n\nI was afraid he'd go physical against me so I excused myself.\n\nPeople have told me that nothing was wrong with what I did.

He wants to be a homophobe that is fine, but he has to deal with the fallout.\n\nYou were just doing your job.\n\nReally surprised his GF didn't know before....", "NTA, LOL, Jason on the receiving end of the hate he was giving \ud83d\udc9e", "NTa, he made a public appearance and there has been fallout - what was he expecting? You documenting the event is the same enshrined constitutional freedom that he enjoyed hoisting his placard. This is the base truth - regardless of which side of the protest you are on.", "NTA.  He chose to be there, in a public place, where folks could and did see him.  He is being judged solely on his own actions.  You did nothing wrong as it was a true and accurate image in a public place.  If he wanted to send a different message, he should have chosen a different venue.  He can\u2019t complain of his own choices, no mistakes.", "NTA. His true colors are showing. Now that his acquaintances know how he is, people who don't like homophobes will dissociate themselves from Jason.\n\nYou're not an asshole just for taking a photo, which happened to have Jason in it.", "NTA \nYou were doing what any non-student reporter would be doing anyways. \n\nIt\u2019s not like you zoomed in on one person or singled him out in particular. \n\nIf he was so worried about his reputation he shouldn\u2019t have participated in a public demonstration.", "NTA. He was out demonstrating in public. Anyone could have seen him. If he didn\u2019t want to be identified he could have worn a mask.", "NTA. Jason was out there demonstrating for his cause. He should thank you for the publicity.\n\nAfter that public demonstration, if he wants his picture taken down, he's a hypocrite.\n\nHow can Jason possibly call you out for making him look bad? All you did was photograph Jason being Jason. If he thinks it makes him look bad, then maybe he should do some thinking about how he's shown himself.", "NTA. Jason's Actions have consequences.", "Absolutely NTA! Jason and his friends are the assholes. His girlfriend broke up with him because of his actions.", "Nta he was at a public event.  What was he expecting???", "NTA. He wanted to be seen without any of the negative consequences. He's welcome to express his views through more anonymous means, and this was the choice he made. This wasn't a personal attack on your part. Anyone could have taken that photo and uploaded it anywhere.", "NTA. The thing about protests is that they are public and the whole point is to be seen and heard. If you want to keep your views private stay home. And if you do make your views public accept some people won't like them.", "NTA. He was at a public event while holding a sign. There is no privacy for him there. He made his choice and you made yours. \n\nYou should remind him that actions have consequences. He is entitled to his views just like everyone else including his girlfriend.", "NTAH. He was in public. With a sign. In the anti-LGBTQ+ crowd. I\u2019m SURE that if you hadn\u2019t posted photos someone else would\u2019ve. Him being angry at you was stupid.", "NTA. They all deserve to be exposed; have better manners/tolerance/love and people will likely stop \u201cgiving you a hard time\u201d.", "NTA. It'd be different if he had been just walking by and it looked like he was there.  He was actively participating.  In general, if you don't want anyone to know you were doing something, you probably shouldn't be doing it", "FAFO", "NTA.  I was originally wondering if he was accidentally in a photo with the bigots, but that he wasn't actually with them and people were getting the wrong idea when you posted the photo.  But if he was holding a sign, everyone knows what side he was really on, and now he is reaping what he sowed.  Eff him.  If he doesn't want everyone to know he is a homophobic asshole, he shouldn't be a homophobic asshole.", "OP your friend Jason was stupid for not covering his face up like some of these other anti-LGBTQIA+ white supremacist protestors who refuse to be identified and vilified like the cowards they are.  Maybe next time he'll take a page out of their book and wear a mask so he doesn't ruin his sterling reputation.", "Nta\n\nHe was actively participating. Ask if he was ashamed to be there, because if he was proud to be there I'm sure he would love his picture being shown along with his beliefs.", "Actions have consequences. He was protesting against gay people and got \u201couted\u201d doing so. \n\nSucks to be him. \n\nNTA", "NTA - The dude felt strongly enough to take part in a protest, now he lives of the consequences.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was a PUBLIC protest, others saw it, and you just documented it (I'm sure others took pictures also).  He has to deal with the results of his actions. This is all on him.", "NTA. Being a homophobic AH comes with consequences. Do not take down the photo. People need to see what kind of a person Jason is. Also kudos to the gf for taking quick action when most people ignore this monster of a red flag because they\u2019re in love.", "NTA.  He fucked around.  Now he's finding out.\n\nIf he or anyone else brings it up again just say \"I'm sorry you're so upset about the consequences of your own actions.\"", "NTA.  He was in public.  Anyone can have their picture taken, videoed in public.  If he was proud of what he was doing in public,  what is the problem?", "NTA, not your fault for his decisions. Why would he go to a protest for a hill he isn't willing to die on? Makes 0 sense. If you don't care that much don't go, if you do shouldn't your friends and GF already know how you stand and thus it shouldn't impact you? I mean for ffs he was publicly protesting.", "NTA play stupid games win stupid prizes", "NTA. He did nothing wrong. Actions have consequences. He\u2019s only upset because you exposed him.", "INFO: you need to inform your school in case Jason escalates", "I am not a journalist or anything so I am truly curious?  Before posting pictures on a website or newspaper, don\u2019t you have to have permission from the people in the photo to post it?  Or was this a personal site like FB or Instagram?  With that said, if he asked you to remove the photo, you should have done so.", "NTA. So, Jason was willing to take part in a very public protest, with his face completely unobstructed, but didn't account for the possibility that someone would recognize him? Even if you didn't take the photo, he could have been found out anyway - a counter-protester or passerby could have recognized him. \n\nApart from that, he must not hold his convictions very strongly if he wants to erase all evidence of them the moment he might face consequences for them.", "NTA, Jason did all of that damage himself.", "NTA\n\nThe entire point of a protest is to be seen and heard. To attract publicity. To make the news/be photographed. \n\nHe could have been a homophobe privately and at the ballot box. Instead he made sure his views were made public. Seems odd that he\u2019s so upset that people know about views he went to such great length to demonstrate to the world. \n\nHe really should ask himself why he holds views he\u2019s ashamed of or why he\u2019s ashamed of his views. \n\nAnd he and his friends need to stop blaming you for him receiving consequences for his own actions.", "NTA a person has no expectation of privacy in a public place, especially while protesting.  If he didn't want his identity known he should have hid his face.", "NTA\n\nOh no, actions have consequences! Who could have known?!\n\nHe decided to show his true colours in public - in a time when literally everyone has a camera at their disposal, there was no way this was going to remain a state secret. Guess homophobes are evil AND stupid.", "You did nothing legally or morally wrong. He chose to protest gay peoples rights in a public place Im honestly surprised he thought he wouldnt get recognized.", "NTA. He was publicly waving his hate around, the consequences of that are on him. He\u2019s free to protest if he wants, but if he\u2019s going to do it in public then he needs to be prepared to accept responsibility for his beliefs.", "NTA: he went to his protest because he wanted to be seen and to spread the message on his sign. You helped him achieve his goals.", "This falls under the broad category of we all have freedom of speech - but we don\u2019t have freedom from the consequences of our speech.\n\nJason is suffering the consequences of his speech.\n\nAs a future journalist, this is one of those moment you get to decide:\n\n1. Are you willing to accept that doing your job well will sometime have personal repercussions?\n2. Are you willing to report the truth in an unbiased manner even when there is pressure to hide the truth?\n\nYou will have a lot of ethical challenges as a journalist - I encourage you to be a journalist with integrity!", "NTA. Why would he want to hide his opinion on something that he thinks is (presumably) a sin? the guy needs to own his beliefs and opinion, and turn the other cheek when criticised.", "I am so confused. Why would he take issue with you taking pictures of a protest that he attended? I mean does he only stand for his homophobic principals when there are no consequences? That would be funny if it wasn't so .... cowardly.\n\nDefinitely NTA", "NTA - protesting means publicly standing for something. if one does that , of cause one will get consequences for your standpoint.", "NTA, bigots should be publicly shamed as much as possible. Period.\n\nTheir inner circle chatter often call their pathetic degenerate crusade a war, so let them fucking have it.", "I don\u2019t think so", "NTA. Jason is learning that spreading hate has consequences.", "Should be thanking OP for giving him the visibility and attention he was begging for.", "Austin 3:16 is \u201cI just whooped your ass\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Lesnar 1:15.", "She's probably knew but didn't want the attention, just like he didn't want it.", "Not even as much as what he was dishing out. He wants to strip people of their rights. They just don\u2019t want to hang with him if he feels that way!", "It was literally a public protest. Did he go hoping no one would notice him? It just makes no sense.", "No, if they are in a public place where you would have no expectation to privacy, you absolutely do not need their permission to post them for news", "Cause he came out the homophobic closet and didn't expect to be seen and now can't go back and hide cause closets lost it's doors, baring his bullshit for all to see. \n\nI wanna hedge a bet he was \"friends\" (loosely) with people in the LGBT+ community for personal benefits: getting notes, discounts at people's jobs, networking in his/their industy and now it's out - he's lost all connections and likely employment opportunities", "Yeah, it looks bad for her once it's public."]}
