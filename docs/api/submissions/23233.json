Next time you'll be banned because you were \"snide\" while your dad was out of the room. Then it you'll become \"a negative influence\". After that all your pictures will disappear from the walls. She'll keep ramping it up, and every time your dad does nothing, she gains another tiny foothold. I truly, strongly, believe the only way to win is not to play. And that comes from someone who tried to play for literal decades. Keep up moderate contact so your dad knows you love him.

Your dad not telling you that the Sunday dinners were cancelled was really, really disrespectful in my opinion and I say that as a parent who is probably around his age.

My mother is very codependent mentally, even though she had a great job and income.  My father had paid for their home and land completely, the land was nice, very well kept, no debt left when he passed.  \n\nMom started going to a singles group at church.  She met a man who said all the right things, and she married him.  Fast forward to today, over 20 years later:  He had her mortgage the home and property, bought trucks and cars, gave money to young girls as their sugar daddy, mostly behind my mother's back.  My sister and I told her over the years, she thinks we are lying or exaggerating.\n\n She is now 81, in debt way over her head, the home is falling apart, the property is overgrown and a mess.  Her hubby, who still has her blind to his shenanigans, does nothing for her, lives in another city \"for work\" he tells her.   I moved in with her to fix the house and clean up the property, and to help her with everything.  Hubby still just talks to her on the phone a few days a week, unless he's sick, then she's there taking care of him.   When she is sick, he is nowhere to be found.\n\nThere were times when our communication was almost nonexistent because of him.  Similar story, his children want nothing to do with him, he was in prison for some years before they met.  He's an old con man who found his cash cow to finish his life with.\n\nThis is possibly your future.

I wanted to bring my cat and they called a cop to come to the house and make sure when I moved all my stuff out that I didn\u2019t take the cat. My dad had adopted her for me true and it was his payment and all that, but it was a gift to me about 5 years before hand. I remember sitting on my bedroom floor bawling because the cop knew my dad and wouldn\u2019t let me leave with \u201cnot my property\u201d.

You said in the opening paragraph your father's girlfriend moved in after one month of dating and took over your father's finances. In no way is that acceptable and in no way are you to blame past being upset your family tradition of Sunday dinners is interrupted, and not by your father in person but with a text from his girlfriend like a f-boy might do. (I am curious what time she starts work. Is she actually in bed by 8 because she works very early? I doubt it. It's about control or simply wanting to do something else most likely.)\n\nThe reality is that your relationship with your father was not as strong as you thought and that he chose his gf over you. That is what happened. He didn't stick up for your family dinners and he blocked you from your childhood home (on her orders no doubt). The dinners are one thing but blocking you is a tactic to make you obedient to his gf in a one way, top down relationship filled with ultimatums where everything is on her terms with you the same way as it is with your father. I tell you that so you can accept it and make peace with it as I have had to do with some relationships. \n\nAs for your son I don't think a father who treats his daughter this way for a 1 year girlfriend who runs his show is a good role model. I would keep contact to a minimum on neutral ground. It isn't OK for your father and gf to play the benevolent grandparents while they treat you like an inferior. Stick up for your son and the man you want him to be. I'm sorry your father chose his gf over you but that's what happened. Things will never go back. She has her claws in him deep.\n\nEdit: Read OP's comments and the gf is an accountant so she works at 9 AM most likely. She can't have Sunday dinner with a 9 year-old because she works at 9? She lied. A compromise would be to have Sunday dinner every second Sunday or the first Sunday of each month. The gf just banned a decades long tradition because everything is one way ie. parent to child, tyrant to peasant. \n\nThe other thing is the family that sided against her is probably related to her dad.

If he shuts you down and keeps demanding the apology you can apologize for any language used (if offensive for example) you can tell him that you love him and wish him well but to move forward there would need to be some clarity on her and your boundaries.\nIt may be reasonable to ask a late meal to be moved to another day or time (rather than demanding cancellation) if she has to work Monday morning, especially if they live in a small flat or a home where noise travels and she would wake up. Or it could be moved to lunch instead. Your childhood home has sentimental value but is your father's (I assume). You maybe could have said when would suit her better or just not responded and asked your dad.
