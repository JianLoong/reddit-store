We each got 6 tickets @ $750 per. \r  \nThe next day, my best friend (John 41) of 20+ years, wife (Kelly 40) posted she was upset because she didn\u2019t tickets. They moved across the country a few years ago but I fly to see them every year & we talk every day. I called Kelly & she said she didn\u2019t care about cost & needed 2 tickets. I said my SIL is selling hers @$2500 per. I felt bad about the price my SIL set so offered to pay for half. Kelly responded saying she was upset I was trying to make money off her. I explained these were my SIL tickets, she set the price, & I would cover half. (My SIL & Kelly briefly met at my wedding; SIL was selling to her friends at the same price.)\r  \nJohn & I start talking less. I chalked it up to busy life. 4 months since the tickets went on sale, John\u2019s mom had a cancer diagnosis. I spent the next month calling/texting John daily with no response. I\u2019ve been his best friend for 20+ years & wanted to support him. During this time I offered to fly him to visit his mom, fly to visit him, support from afar with meal train... No response. Two months after the diagnosis we finally talk, gloss over the fact we haven\u2019t been talking, just checking on him/the emotional toll. John\u2019s mom\u2019s health is now better & the cancer is under control. \r  \n6 months since this started I tell John my SIL is selling the remaining 2 tickets at face value. I offer to cover the cost just so we can put this behind us. John asks that I don\u2019t offer them to Kelly & instead apologize to her for the whole thing. I am caught off guard & say I will call her in a few days. After thinking about it, I don\u2019t see why I should be apologizing. I promised Kelly I would hold tickets for her (which I did) but never said I would pay for them. My SIL set the price since they were her tickets to use & sell. I offered to pay for half, & then when at face value, offered to give them to her. \r  \n9 months from when this started John has flown into town 6+ times mostly alone. I have been calling/texting on this one-way street for months. John finally answered my call & said that his wife is still so upset about the tickets that he is forbidden from talking/texting with me even when alone. John is now not responding to me so he can support his wife.\r  \nMy final straw came when I saw a post from Kelly that they were in town for weeks & met with friends but not me. Rather than ghost the friendship, I felt the mature thing to do was talk to John & I say I\u2019m done trying & hopefully in a few years we can be friends again, but I don\u2019t have the energy for this any longer.\r  \nAITA?\r  \nContext: If they were my tickets, I would have sold at face value.

I can\u2019t believe you even offered to pay anything for them for her, and even then it wasn\u2019t good enough. She obviously cares more about her unrighteousness indignation than her husband\u2019s connection with a dear friend or 2 decades of being great friends through I\u2019m sure way more substantive challenges than freaking TS tickets. What a manipulative and entitled brat. No good deed goes unpunished. I\u2019m so sorry she\u2019s willing to discard her husband\u2019s feelings and his friendship. She clearly  never valued your friendship or viewed you as her friend.", "SATA - (Swifties are the assholes) \n\nNo but for real NTA.
