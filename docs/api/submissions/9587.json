{"id": 9587, "submission_id": "10ychov", "title": "Update: Couple's counseling didn't help; an honest discussion did.", "selftext": "My wife and I went to couple's counseling. When we called to book there was one counselor that had a last minute opening and the rest had long waits. There was a reason for this. If you ever need to book a therapist, don't book the one with immediate availability. Anyway, so we went this morning.\n\nFirst and foremost, the therapist would not listen to us as we tried to explain why we were there. So much time was wasted because she kept insisting on talking about and asking about topics that weren't what we needed to talk about. My wife and I both repeatedly tried to explain the issue, and the therapist kept saying \"the surface issue is rarely the problem; it's the issue underneath that.\" It took half an hour for us to get her to actually address what occurred.\n\nWhen she finally listened to us explain what happened she said flat out that I was wrong, my wife was right, I need to apologize for what I said and accept that her dad would always be important to her and had a right to be in his grandchild's life. I'm pretty sure therapists are supposed to be a bit more neutral. Anyway, she could tell I was irritated and asked what I was feeling. I said I felt deceived. I felt like my wife pretended to be someone and now I'm meeting the real her.\n\nMy wife started to cry and the therapist said my answer was unproductive. I asked my wife \"what about you? How do you feel?\" She said she felt lost. She said she's lost her family one by one because they did things she couldn't accept. Realizing the child she was carrying would never know her biological family upset her, and it made her wonder if her standards are too high.\n\nThe therapist jumped in and said it's important to meet people where they are out and cutting people out isn't the answer. The therapist ended things saying we had a lot of work to do but could fix things. When we left my wife said \"she was very opinionated for a therapist.\" I agreed. She asked if we could go get brunch and just talk, and I agreed to that to.\n\nWe talked. I apologized for the way I spoke to her. She apologized for keeping secrets from me. I told her I would never be okay with her dad being part of our kids lives. She said she understood. I also said I thought it was a bad idea to go back to the old company, but ultimately that's her choice. She said she was going to tell her dad that meeting the baby isn't on the table and then see his reaction and go from there. I thanked her for telling me.\n\nShe asked me if I was thinking about leaving her. I was honest and said I had thought about it but that wasn't what I wanted. We both got very emotional. She asked if I loved her and I said yes. I asked if she loved my son, and she said yes. I asked if she thinks she'll love the baby more, and she said no. She hesitated, but I'm trying not to read into that.\n\nI feel we made some progress and we will continue to work on our relationship (without the terrible therapist) and try to be our best for each other and the children.", "created_utc": 1675992438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ychov/update_couples_counseling_didnt_help_an_honest/", "score": 766, "replies": ["I think you don't give the Therapist enough credit, by being intentionally terrible at her job it prompted you two to really get to the heart of the issues underneath on your own.", "Original\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w3lzx/aita_for_making_my_pregnant_wife_cry_by_calling/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "Wow, some therapists suck.

So it isn't automatically a sign of a lie or deception. I think she wanted to be sure that's how she felt before answering, if that makes sense.\n\nGoing forward i hope you both continue to have these open deep conversations and share how you feel because that's what a relationship thrives on.\n\nI wish you both happiness.

I hope we never cross paths.", "Never is a bit of a strong word to use. Every blended family is different. Some people meet their step children at an older age. And sometimes these step children are at a stage where they aren\u2019t after a step parent/parental figure.

But that doesn\u2019t mean in other cases it\u2019s impossible to love a stepchild who they\u2019ve raised as much as their bios.\n\nIf biology is that important a factor then it\u2019s like painting everyone with a broad brush and saying adoptive parents can never love their children as much. The reality is that there are adoptive parents who will fight tooth and nail for their children, and some who are so abusive they should never have been parents.

That there is the truth of being human.", "I support your decision to try and not read into it - her hormones will be crazy right now coupled with a lot of guilt, and feeling super connected to the child that\u2019s physically growing inside her, and feeling like her life has had a sudden upheaval.  She\u2019s probably just as anxious with thoughts of \u201cwhat if I do love this child more\u201d because anxiety tends to hang around the most taboo subjects.\n\nLoving someone unconditionally is a choice, and as long as she keeps choosing to show as much love to her stepchild as she does to her biological one, I wouldn\u2019t worry.", "Uhhh\u2026 please find a real therapist and get into asap. Not saying to divorce your wife but this seems like a slippery slope. She was willing to put your son at risk of being around racists again(who made inappropriate comments to a child), she secretly contacted him and then considered working with him again, then when asked if she would treat them differently she couldn\u2019t give a definitive answer. It\u2019s natural to miss family, but not at her current family\u2019s expense. She may also have some internalized negative habits that she needs professional help getting through/over. It\u2019s also concerning she jumped to divorce after one(?) major issue. The lying, manipulation, and lack of consideration for your son is concerning and should be closely monitored. You need to find out if her father is more important than her family.", "How are you going to keep that man out of your kid's life if wife goes back to the old company? Genuine question.\n\nAs bad as that therapist sounds, I'm tempted to guess she intentionally pulled this stunt knowing the effects.", "For what it's worth, I wouldn't get hung up on the hesitation. This is her first time being pregnant and she's figuring out how that makes her feel. She took the time to think about the question and I think that's valuable. It shows that she's really paying attention to your question and giving it the consideration it deserves. I would also say that her hormones maybe leading her to feel that she needs to connect to her family for the baby's sake and that continuing to talk about it will help her keep her grounded.", "Your son is s c r e w e d. Sorry but I guarantee you that her father will wreck your life and that child\u2019s life. When it happens remember reddit warned you. She\u2019s her father\u2019s daughter. That\u2019s a fact.", "My father would like a word. So would my mom. \n\nI didn\u2019t even know my big brother was my half brother until I was *twelve*. Dad adopted him when he married mom. Never looked back, never treated him a damn bit differently than any of us, and quite frankly I\u2019m pretty sure he was Dads favorite. I have seen my father cry exactly two times in my life. The first was when my husband died, the second was when my brother died. \n\nMy half sister who my parents did not raise is closer to my mom, her stepmom, than her biological mom who she is no contact with. \n\nOh and my kids? They\u2019re adopted and if you think for one second I would lose my mind and love them less than one I got stuck growing you\u2019re absolutely incorrect. I fought for those two. I put myself between them and so many fucked up things with a ferocity that was nearly feral. They were neglected, they were abused, they damn near fell through the cracks in more than one system. Biology doesn\u2019t mean shit. Humans do horrific things to their biological offspring.", "Had mine thru the military for like 4 years I had this immense guilt that I was over taking my husband\u2019s situation.

I felt very invalidated till I somehow talked with this lady that helps with DV for women/children. \n\nThere I finally had the answer what I had was called secondary trauma where I got so empathic I somehow absorbed my husband\u2019s trauma. I was going thru all the stages my husband couldn\u2019t so we had counseling with her as a support group. Honestly although it was weird to speak about it to other ppl but I finally validated and understood why i felt the way I did.

He is her father, even if he's racist he's still the man that raised her and loves her. She made a crazy sacrifice cutting him out of her life, so of course she wants to reconcile. Cutting people out of your life is the easiest way to deal with the problem, rarely the best. At some point we all have to parent our parents if she's willing to do it just let her. I understand not wanting to parent an adult but at least let her try. Keeping her away from him is unnecessarily cruel (sorry to use that word but it is).

Also though, as a parent of a Black kid, OP, you shouldn't just look for resentment, but also what else she's willing to accept to not lose more. It sounds like your son easily could've been that sacrifice. It's understandable for her to be upset at the loss of her family, but someone who has absorbed that much racism over time may not see it as easily or may be used to letting it be rug-swept, which is not safe for your son and needs to be addressed", "Is this sarcasm?", "The fuck is wrong with you!?
