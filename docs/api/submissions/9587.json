{"id": 9587, "submission_id": "10ychov", "title": "Update: Couple's counseling didn't help; an honest discussion did.", "selftext": "My wife and I went to couple's counseling. When we called to book there was one counselor that had a last minute opening and the rest had long waits. There was a reason for this. If you ever need to book a therapist, don't book the one with immediate availability. Anyway, so we went this morning.\n\nFirst and foremost, the therapist would not listen to us as we tried to explain why we were there. So much time was wasted because she kept insisting on talking about and asking about topics that weren't what we needed to talk about. My wife and I both repeatedly tried to explain the issue, and the therapist kept saying \"the surface issue is rarely the problem; it's the issue underneath that.\" It took half an hour for us to get her to actually address what occurred.\n\nWhen she finally listened to us explain what happened she said flat out that I was wrong, my wife was right, I need to apologize for what I said and accept that her dad would always be important to her and had a right to be in his grandchild's life. I'm pretty sure therapists are supposed to be a bit more neutral. Anyway, she could tell I was irritated and asked what I was feeling. I said I felt deceived. I felt like my wife pretended to be someone and now I'm meeting the real her.\n\nMy wife started to cry and the therapist said my answer was unproductive. I asked my wife \"what about you? How do you feel?\" She said she felt lost. She said she's lost her family one by one because they did things she couldn't accept. Realizing the child she was carrying would never know her biological family upset her, and it made her wonder if her standards are too high.\n\nThe therapist jumped in and said it's important to meet people where they are out and cutting people out isn't the answer. The therapist ended things saying we had a lot of work to do but could fix things. When we left my wife said \"she was very opinionated for a therapist.\" I agreed. She asked if we could go get brunch and just talk, and I agreed to that to.\n\nWe talked. I apologized for the way I spoke to her. She apologized for keeping secrets from me. I told her I would never be okay with her dad being part of our kids lives. She said she understood. I also said I thought it was a bad idea to go back to the old company, but ultimately that's her choice. She said she was going to tell her dad that meeting the baby isn't on the table and then see his reaction and go from there. I thanked her for telling me.\n\nShe asked me if I was thinking about leaving her. I was honest and said I had thought about it but that wasn't what I wanted. We both got very emotional. She asked if I loved her and I said yes. I asked if she loved my son, and she said yes. I asked if she thinks she'll love the baby more, and she said no. She hesitated, but I'm trying not to read into that.\n\nI feel we made some progress and we will continue to work on our relationship (without the terrible therapist) and try to be our best for each other and the children.", "created_utc": 1675992438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ychov/update_couples_counseling_didnt_help_an_honest/", "score": 114, "replies": ["I think you don't give the Therapist enough credit, by being intentionally terrible at her job it prompted you two to really get to the heart of the issues underneath on your own.", "Original\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w3lzx/aita_for_making_my_pregnant_wife_cry_by_calling/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "Wow, some therapists suck. Glad you made progress for free, though!", "Sounds like the therapist was the genius in this scenario.  See her one time and you guys do what you weren't able to do before seeing her.  Tempted to ask for a referral just in case I ever need it.", "lol what issue could be underneath \"I don't want her racist dad to be in our child's life and I'm mad that she had been talking to her racist dad behind my back?\". Come on.\n\nI'm glad you were able to talk it out. Hopefully you can keep the communication open. And hopefully her father will either change and become a better person, or back off.", "What a horrible therapist.  Hope things work out for you.", "I can understand your wife\u2019s pause; she may be questioning herself because her actions show differently than how she may truly feel (that she loves your son). The inner turmoil most likely caused the pause, and I hope that in the future she realizes that although her father may be her family, it is more important to protect your son from racism because of her love for him", "is there anyway to report that therapist? what a disaster of a person.\n\nbut i do hope things work out for you!", "NAH except for the \u2018therapist\u2019.  So pleased you are making progress as a couple", "I know you love your wife but please look out for you son. Her father is a racist. His racism won't negatively impact her or the child you  share but it definitely will impact your son. I think she is saying what you want to hear at the moment but I think this issue will come up again. Especially after your baby is born. She gave up her family for you and your son. She is already starting to shows signs of cracking. I wouldn't be surprise if eventually she starts to resent you and your son for her not being able to see her father or have her child grow up with a loving albeit racist grandfather. The person with the potential to be hurt most is your son. I get your marriage is important but protecting you son is more important", "Glad you're making progress despite the shitty therapist.  Also glad that she's agreeing to keep the racist out of your overall family's life, I just hope that you'll both remember to keep communicating as things move forward.", "She will never be able to love your son as much as a child that is biologically hers. There is **no** shame in that. This is just being human. \n\nInstead, focus on her ability to acknowledge this and still *try*. She *wants* to love your son as much, and even if she falls short from *your* expectations, her being willing and wanting to try will be worth more to your son than you can ever imagine.\n\nIt's what we do that matters, not what we feel.", "I have a feeling that therapist is toxic in her own right and has been cut off by family herself as a result.", "I just hope your son is okay.", "Its great you guys were able to get a starting point in working out a healthy path for your marriage to move forward. \n\nOn the other hand, it would be in your best interest and those of other couples to report this therapist. Not only to the company that they worked with but to the licensing board. \n\nIts important that they know how incompetent this therapist is. Dont let them get away with their behavior and comments. Report them and hopefully they won't be able to damage another marriage more than it already is. \n\nNot everyone will be able to salvage the marriage the way you were able to. This therapist is doing more harm than good. \n\nIts good to report them, for lazy therapy.", "Cutting toxic people out of your life isn't the answer? \n\nI bet lots of unhappy customers cut that therapist out of theirs and feel better for it. I would.\n\nAlways shop for a therapist that genuinely listens. People forget they are also a business and as a consumer you have a right to shop around for one that fits.\n\nIm so glad you guys got to talk and figure things out.\n\nAs for the hesitation to respond, sometimes you have to feel the answer in your heart before you can respond honestly, especially if you haven't thought about it before. So it isn't automatically a sign of a lie or deception. I think she wanted to be sure that's how she felt before answering, if that makes sense.\n\nGoing forward i hope you both continue to have these open deep conversations and share how you feel because that's what a relationship thrives on.\n\nI wish you both happiness. It's always nice when its a happy beginning.", "Well you absolutely need to pay a lot of attention as you move forward because while your wife is saying the right things now, the truth will be in her actions and behavior.", "This is great. Honestly, as far as loving her bio child more, it could be thing but it might not be \u201cI love my bio child more and therefore will mistreat my step child\u201d it\u2019s just different, that\u2019s all. The child that makes you a parent first always holds a special place in your heart. So it\u2019s good you don\u2019t read into too much. Happy you guys were able to work it out.", "Maybe the therapist was playing 3D chess while you were playing checkers. Therapist was deliberately acting like this so you would find common ground and talk it over. Sounds like they've done their job and their services are no longer required. Kind of like colombo when he pretends to be a shit detective to let the suspects guard down.\n\nThe other therapists are fully booked because they haven't resolved their clients issues and are dragging it out to get more money.", "I hope you are right.", "My husband and I once saw a terrible couples\u2019 therapist, and we ended up teaming up together against her.  That was funny, and helped, TBH, but she was awful and we fired her.", "All the comments saying the therapist is shit but look what she's achieved in one session. Sounds like she's done a good job.", "This 100% \u2026 it\u2019s one thing to give up family because you truly want to\u2026. But when you feel like your \u201cnew\u201d family forced you to\u2026. I would be prepared to take eldest out of that situation and prepare to get the youngest into therapy as soon as they are old enough. You are stuck with her because of the kid. And that grandfather/fil is going to poison  any kids you all have together against you because he lost control of his daughter.", "\"She will never be able to love your son as much as a child that is biologically hers.\"\n\nAs an adopted kid, get the fuck outta here with shit like this.\n\n\nEdit - know plenty of step parents who would tell you the same thing that have bio and step kids.", "What a disturbing thing to say. I hope we never cross paths.", "Never is a bit of a strong word to use. Every blended family is different. Some people meet their step children at an older age. And sometimes these step children are at a stage where they aren\u2019t after a step parent/parental figure. In cases like these then there is no shame to say that the step parent\u2019s relationship with their bio kids is stronger than with the steps. But that doesn\u2019t mean in other cases it\u2019s impossible to love a stepchild who they\u2019ve raised as much as their bios.\n\nIf biology is that important a factor then it\u2019s like painting everyone with a broad brush and saying adoptive parents can never love their children as much. The reality is that there are adoptive parents who will fight tooth and nail for their children, and some who are so abusive they should never have been parents. But the same could be said of bio parents. That there is the truth of being human.", "I support your decision to try and not read into it - her hormones will be crazy right now coupled with a lot of guilt, and feeling super connected to the child that\u2019s physically growing inside her, and feeling like her life has had a sudden upheaval.  She\u2019s probably just as anxious with thoughts of \u201cwhat if I do love this child more\u201d because anxiety tends to hang around the most taboo subjects.\n\nLoving someone unconditionally is a choice, and as long as she keeps choosing to show as much love to her stepchild as she does to her biological one, I wouldn\u2019t worry."]}
