{"id": 9587, "submission_id": "10ychov", "title": "Update: Couple's counseling didn't help; an honest discussion did.", "selftext": "My wife and I went to couple's counseling. When we called to book there was one counselor that had a last minute opening and the rest had long waits. There was a reason for this. If you ever need to book a therapist, don't book the one with immediate availability. Anyway, so we went this morning.\n\nFirst and foremost, the therapist would not listen to us as we tried to explain why we were there. So much time was wasted because she kept insisting on talking about and asking about topics that weren't what we needed to talk about. My wife and I both repeatedly tried to explain the issue, and the therapist kept saying \"the surface issue is rarely the problem; it's the issue underneath that.\" It took half an hour for us to get her to actually address what occurred.\n\nWhen she finally listened to us explain what happened she said flat out that I was wrong, my wife was right, I need to apologize for what I said and accept that her dad would always be important to her and had a right to be in his grandchild's life. I'm pretty sure therapists are supposed to be a bit more neutral. Anyway, she could tell I was irritated and asked what I was feeling. I said I felt deceived. I felt like my wife pretended to be someone and now I'm meeting the real her.\n\nMy wife started to cry and the therapist said my answer was unproductive. I asked my wife \"what about you? How do you feel?\" She said she felt lost. She said she's lost her family one by one because they did things she couldn't accept. Realizing the child she was carrying would never know her biological family upset her, and it made her wonder if her standards are too high.\n\nThe therapist jumped in and said it's important to meet people where they are out and cutting people out isn't the answer. The therapist ended things saying we had a lot of work to do but could fix things. When we left my wife said \"she was very opinionated for a therapist.\" I agreed. She asked if we could go get brunch and just talk, and I agreed to that to.\n\nWe talked. I apologized for the way I spoke to her. She apologized for keeping secrets from me. I told her I would never be okay with her dad being part of our kids lives. She said she understood. I also said I thought it was a bad idea to go back to the old company, but ultimately that's her choice. She said she was going to tell her dad that meeting the baby isn't on the table and then see his reaction and go from there. I thanked her for telling me.\n\nShe asked me if I was thinking about leaving her. I was honest and said I had thought about it but that wasn't what I wanted. We both got very emotional. She asked if I loved her and I said yes. I asked if she loved my son, and she said yes. I asked if she thinks she'll love the baby more, and she said no. She hesitated, but I'm trying not to read into that.\n\nI feel we made some progress and we will continue to work on our relationship (without the terrible therapist) and try to be our best for each other and the children.", "created_utc": 1675992438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ychov/update_couples_counseling_didnt_help_an_honest/", "score": 35, "replies": ["I think you don't give the Therapist enough credit, by being intentionally terrible at her job it prompted you two to really get to the heart of the issues underneath on your own.", "Original\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w3lzx/aita_for_making_my_pregnant_wife_cry_by_calling/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "Wow, some therapists suck. Glad you made progress for free, though!", "Sounds like the therapist was the genius in this scenario.  See her one time and you guys do what you weren't able to do before seeing her.

Come on.\n\nI'm glad you were able to talk it out. Hopefully you can keep the communication open. And hopefully her father will either change and become a better person, or back off.", "What a horrible therapist.  Hope things work out for you.", "I can understand your wife\u2019s pause; she may be questioning herself because her actions show differently than how she may truly feel (that she loves your son). The inner turmoil most likely caused the pause, and I hope that in the future she realizes that although her father may be her family, it is more important to protect your son from racism because of her love for him", "is there anyway to report that therapist? what a disaster of a person.\n\nbut i do hope things work out for you!", "NAH except for the \u2018therapist\u2019.  So pleased you are making progress as a couple", "I know you love your wife but please look out for you son. Her father is a racist. His racism won't negatively impact her or the child you  share but it definitely will impact your son. I think she is saying what you want to hear at the moment but I think this issue will come up again. Especially after your baby is born. She gave up her family for you and your son. She is already starting to shows signs of cracking. I wouldn't be surprise if eventually she starts to resent you and your son for her not being able to see her father or have her child grow up with a loving albeit racist grandfather. The person with the potential to be hurt most is your son. I get your marriage is important but protecting you son is more important"]}
