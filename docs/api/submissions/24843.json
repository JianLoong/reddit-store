I\u2019m going to pull an all-nighter\u201d because \u201cYou turned on all of the lights and woke me up.\u201d And \u201cI cannot go back to sleep\u201d (may or may not be verbatim). \n\nThis makes me angry, and I react. I say \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you cannot go back to sleep\u201d, in an aggressive tone. \n\nHe says, \u201cBecause you turned on all of the lights, woke me up, and you yelled my name.\u201d (May or may not be verbatim) \n\nI said, in an aggressive tone, \u201cIf you\u2019re tired enough, you can go back to sleep. I bet if I turned the WIFI off, you\u2019d go back to sleep. \n\nHe says \u201cI hope you apologize over this in the morning.\u201d This makes me more angry. \n\nWe proceed to argue and he says \u201c I have to wake up early to take my mother to have surgery. I cannot believe how selfish you are.\u201d (not verbatim, but along the lines of what was said) \n\nTell me Reddit, and I the \u201cA-Hole\u201d?\n\nEDIT: When my dog has woken me up in the past, I do not wake him up. I truly thought this was an emergency. Me going from sleeping to running toward our dog and yelling his name happened in about 10 seconds.\n\nEdit2: Thank you for all of the replies! From NTA to TAH and even to the person who said he should divorce me (lol), I appreciate them all! \nI was TAH for my response in him not going back to sleep. He was worried about his mom.

Your lizard brain got activated, and released a bunch of cortisol into your system. So naturally you are both going to scream, and have a fit at each other. It's a biochemical response to a panic moment. I'm sure it was exacerbated by your sleep deprivation with having an 8 month old child. \n\nSo apologize for your overblown response. You're NTA, neither is he. But get the dog checked out, and your husband's sleep apnea, too. I hope you get a nap today.", "YTA - you should have checked on the dog and then woke up your husband if he needed to be awake.   \n\n\nYou were also incredibly rude and dismissive to him when he said he wouldn't be going back to sleep. I know myself that if I'm woken up it can take me hours to get back to sleep and in the majority of cases I won't be able to get back to sleep at all.", "YTA. Does he have insomnia? Most people would have checked the dog first, then proceeded if it was an emergency. Sounds like you did all of this on purpose for some reason. Maybe Bc he was sleeping away from you. Then you have the nerve to get aggressive with him verbally Bc YOU woke him up and he will have trouble sleeping? You don't have any room to try to dictate to him he's sleeping schedule or if he can fall back asleep or not. If he does great. But you realize you actually were extremely bullish and aggressive to him over a situation you created.", "Does the dog scream or whine a lot?  Or was this a concern?  I have an elderly dog with medics issues but not dementia.  But I keep close by all the time.", "I read the edit and the comments - ok, it all happened fast, you were panicking and didn't think through. It's ok. I think what makes the whole situation upsetting for him comes in the second part - after you checked and your dog was fine, your husband reminded you of his mother's surgery and early alarm, why couldn't you apologize and explain you freaked out? What's with the wifi thing you told him in response?\n\nOn his side, he could also have made an effort to understand how everything happened fast and not make a scene, but if you were defensive and didn't show any empathy after calming down, you for sure didn't encourage any accommodation from him.\n\nI see in the comments you say you have a 8 months old and aren't sleeping much. It seems like an accident that turned into a big dispute because of stress, lack of sleep and maybe previous arguments/frustration that go beyond this episode alone. \n\nTalk to each other? :)", "NTA, but neither is he.\n\nYou were in a daze, forgot about the surgery, it wasn\u2019t some malicious attack on him, you thought it was an emergency, that\u2019s completely valid.\n\nYou admitted it took you a while to consider his feelings, cool, you did consider them eventually, that\u2019s good. He was obviously mad he got woken up and tried to justify his initial annoyance.\n\nMy advice is, just let it go, both of you. It\u2019s not a hill worth dying on. Also, maybe seek some couples therapy, immediately jumping to aggressive tones on something this small isn\u2019t great. \n\nBest of luck!", "I mean you could have just checked on your dog and woken him up if it is an emergency. He's obviously stressed about his mum who he has to get up to take to surgery. You immediately got aggressive here as well. \n\nI think you were pretty inconsiderate.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on lately, but i seem to have the dissenting opinion here a lot. You were jerked awake in a panic and thought there was an emergency. Of course you called for his help. It sucks that it interrupted his sleep, but that doesn\u2019t mean you are being an asshole. It just means you were startled awake and panicked in your compassion \n\nNot sure how long the argument has gone on. If he\u2019s at his moms surgery now (ie when you made the post) he\u2019s probably just tired and grumpy too. If the is 24 hrs or more later, he\u2019s being a dick about it.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being dramatic", "NTA. You screamed his name in panic, a few seconds after waking up yourself and thought this would be an emergency. I can feel his 'grumpyness' and it's somewhat relateable that he is a little pissed in the moment when woken up by this BUT is this really an issue or a topic to argue about in a healthy relationship?! Things like this happen, gladly there was no real emergency but it's imo totally normal to call out your partners name when frightened by an unusual noice that intends there could be something wrong...", "I really don\u2019t understand how people are calling you TA. It\u2019s obvious that you woke up suddenly in a panic mode, you wasn\u2019t even thinking. It\u2019s not like you woke up your husband just to mess with him lol. He\u2019s childish for acting like that.\nNTA", "NTA\nIt\u2019s your partner, not a toddler. If he has insomnia he should go and see a specialist for appropriate treatment, not take it out on his wife in a passive aggressive manner. He is acting like a brat", "NTA. You woke up and were in a panic about your dog. You didn't do it on purpose or to be spiteful.", "YTA- you already knew your dog has an issue(dementia, night terrors, whatever) AND you knew he was taking his mom for surgery early in the morning. Turning on all the lights and yelling him awake was rude and unnecessary. If you'd just apologized and tried to make it up to him, you'd be less of an ah, but waking him up and then getting into a screaming match about your crap behavior makes you a massive ah.", "I think you were both stressed and panicked and just woken but to be honest - people who sleep/get back to sleep easily honestly don\u2019t understand how hard it is for some people. \n\nAnd it\u2019s annoying when people just disregard the fact that for some of us when we\u2019ve been woken up it\u2019s INCREDIBLY hard to get back to sleep again. I honestly don\u2019t understand how people pop back to sleep so easily.", "I think NAH upto now because I can see both sides. You were also suddenly woken up to screaming and people just react without thinking when they're dazed. He too was cranky by being woken up. I do think though since his mother is having surgery, he is entitled to a bit of grace because in addition to being cranky, he's probably worried too. So I think the nice thing for you to do is to apologise for waking him up without meaning to.", "I often can\u2019t get back to sleep if I\u2019m woken in the night by the cat or an alarm for example, despite being exhausted. I expect you went into autopilot thinking the worst, so I wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying you\u2019re an AH, but I understand your husbands argument.", "NAH.  If something shook me like a sudden emergency, of course my first instinct is to yell out for my husband.  But I can get why he\u2019s irritated too\u2026not everyone can just fall back asleep easily.  Just explain and apologize\u2026doesn\u2019t need to be a big thing.", "YTA not for waking him up while checking on the dog, you did that out of care for a senior dog, but for the way you handled the conversation after. Instead of saying I\u2019m sorry and just going back to bed. You got defensive and created more of an issue. He was woken up out of sleep and worried about his mother. Sometimes its communication later that helps a situation. Neither of you reacted wrong initially.", "Either mum needing surgery really got under the skin of both of you and you were on the edge. Or this is a colossal iceberg with loads of stuff going on under the surface that needs to be addressed.\n\nBoth of you could have handled this better and I hope you talked this through.\n\nESH", "NAH life is hard and shit happens.", "NTA you went into emergency mode, I can relate to that with an elderly pet.", "You were concerned and that\u2019s ok but it seemed to be a false alarm and you did wake him, so even if you didn\u2019t apologize, you don\u2019t have to respond with an aggressive tone. I\u2019m not going to call you an asshole tho lol!", "Sounds like you panicked and he may be stressed in anticipation of the morning procedure. As someone who cannot fall asleep after waking up, I am surprised that you aren\u2019t aware of his sleeping habits. YTA for not being empathetic to his sleep concern. You screamed his name, turned on the lights and left the room. I mean, is this how you want to treat your partner? It\u2019s not very kind. I don\u2019t understand the WiFi note. If he was asleep, he wasn\u2019t on his phone.", "info: You woke him up at 3:30 AM approx (Like 3-4 hours before most working folk get up) and he's now going to pull an 'all nighter'? Cmon thats not how that works.", "NTA you could've just checked on your dog and then wake up your husband but hearing your dog scream/cry during the middle of the night can cause panic so it may be that you instinctively called for help dogs are part of the family their well being is important.Now i understand taking one of your parents to surgery is a stressful task and you feel anxious for their health but i dont think getting woken up is a deal breaker.\nOnce i had to take my father to heart surgery and during the middle of the night my mom woke me up that theres a sound coming from outside i woke up checked it was a racoon. was i frustrated? yes. did i go back to sleep? also yes. woke up in the morning took my dad to surgery. imo something petty as that is not worth a fight also please remember he might be stressed and his reaction was a bit over the top because of that so\nNo one is AH", "YTA- I don\u2019t understand why you needed to yell and turn all the lights on if your aware you pet already has issues, panicking like that is of help to no one even if the pet was in trouble. I would probably be pissed off too for you being so dramatic for no reason", "YTA for literally every action you made. Why on earth you needed to wake him up because dog made some noise? If you had 10 people sleeping in your house, would you have woken up all of them? Dogs can't scream, they can bark, howl and whine. Then you decided it's a good idea to double down on your shitty choice. Seems like you're extremely ignorant tho, he even gave you a chance to apologize yet you still can't see how in the wrong you are.", "I don't get the Y T A votes.\n\nYou woke up to your pet screaming and that would be scary, you went into panic mode, and needed him. I understand being a light sleeper when the OH is not. It puts a lot of pressure onto you if anything happens at night as you will be the one waking up and needing to wake him. \n\nYour dog screamed and you needed to see what was happening. Logic dictates turning on the lights. Is there not a spare room he could sleep in if he needs his sleep that much? I understand this too, sleep is vital. But his sleep issues sound medical. And he needs to get help for them. Hearing or seeing someone stop breathing when sleeping is scary.\n\nClearly he needs help. You are both very tired by the sounds of it.\n\nNAH. Sit down and talk it through. You have taken in the feedback here very well, you clearly care and want to fix this argument. It feels like you are both dealing with a lot.  Give yourselves some time and compassion.\n\nETA therapy. Maybe couples or singly. But therapy will help you both.", "I think it's fine that you were concerned about the dog and woke your husband up since you genuinely thought it was an emergency. \n\nI think you are the asshole a little bit for not apologizing afterwards though. If I was woken up at 3 am in that manner over a false alarm, I'd be a bit grumpy as well. You could have just apologized and told him you were frightened and concerned and it would have probably been a non-issue. If he continued to make a fuss after you apologized, then he'd be the asshole.", "I think the combination of his mothers surgery and the fact that his adrenaline would have surged and his cortisol levels spiked with the way you woke him up is a pretty normal reason to make it impossible to go back to sleep. As a guy, being woken up in that manner means he needs to be ready to fight an intruder.  \n\nThen he has the surgery on his mind plus an argument so there\u2019s no relief from realising it was a false alarm. \n\nYTA for insisting he can just go back to sleep instead of believing him. The waking him up part was just bad judgement but sometimes that happens.", "YTA, not for waking him up but for not apologising. It\u2019s easy to get scared and confused and yell someone\u2019s name before thinking that it\u2019s probably the dog and to check first, and I also understand why he was annoyed about it. I would have said N A H if you\u2019d apologised and not started an argument with him about why he couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. As it stands you\u2019re the AH, sorry", "YTA, the dog has woken you up in the past but you have managed not to wake him up over it. What was so different this time you considered it to be an emergency? I would be upset as well that the time you DO wake him up it\u2019s on the day of his mothers surgery. I don\u2019t exactly understand some bits of this story, I cannot wrap my head around why you wouldn\u2019t check on the dog first or why you overreacted by screaming and waking your husband up (including the lights)? Especially if this behavior has been growing more frequent with your dog, I would be startled though expect it to be nothing more than the usual, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t scare my S/O awake.", "Regarding sleep apnea, when I was a teenager, I slept a lot and had trouble waking up. Fast forward to sleeping with my wife. She's at first annoyed with my snoring, but then she's telling me I stop breathing. Like all night long. I scheduled a sleep study (cause sleep doctors are a thing), and there's paperwork asking me to rate my perception of my sleep quality, and of course, I said I sleep like a rock. Turns out I experienced over 40 breathing events per hour. Breathing events are ceasing to breathe. 25 years later, I'm still using the BPAP, and it's a life changer. I wake up refreshed, I don't nod off every time I sit on my couch. Life is good. Best of luck to you. Oh, YTA a little, but if he won't address his apnea, the he is too.", "ESH. As someone who is a rough sleeper, I understand being pissed off about being awoken in such a manner. Even just saying my name in a calm manner while asleep triggers a huge panic for me. Sometimes my heart races. If someone flipped on all the lights and screamed my name I might have a heart attack and definitely wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. \n\nMy girlfriend knows not to wake me in such a manner. We have an understanding that I have a tendency to be extremely angry when woken up and not to take it personally. I always apologize and she knows that I'm not angry with her, just angry at being awoken. \n\nI say ESH because I feel like as a married couple you should understand that your husband has sleeping difficulties and that waking him up in such a way is cruel. He's an AH for not acknowledging that his sleeping problem effects his mood and that he needs to be more forgiving to you.", "YTA. I get waking up and going to check your dog is ok. Ofcourse you should! And yes that probably includes switching on some lights so you don't trip over things. So far, I get it. I don't understand though why you had to call his name -before- you checked on the dog. If you did so afterwards of something was wrong absolutely.\n\nAnd then the argument, some people have more trouble falling (back) asleep then others. If they are awake, they are awake. People's bodies work different like that and it sounds like yours and your husbands are indeed different. You could've handled it with way more understanding and empathy then you did.", "YTA phoi\u2026  I hope sleeping on the couch now will turn to sleeping in his own bed after he divorces you.", "Yes. Yta. The fuck", ">EDIT: When my dog has woken me up in the past, I do not wake him up. I truly thought this was an emergency. Me going from sleeping to running toward our dog and yelling his name happened in about 10 seconds.\n\nYet you still had time to stop and turn on all the lights? YTA", "How hard is \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I thought it was an emergency. Is there anything I can do to help so you\u2019re rested for tomorrow?\u201d Then accept his answer, even if he says no and is a whiny jerk about it, because he\u2019s a grownup and if he wants to pout instead of sleeping, that\u2019s a choice he gets to make.\n\nESH and I\u2019d guess you guys have some other issues brewing, having to do with mutual respect and appreciation.", "How is this real. You're not the AH for waking him up. YTA for literally everything else about how you communicate to your partner. It would be exhausting married to someone who escalates everything.", "YTA he\u2019s probably stressed about his mother. You should be supportive and understanding instead of taking offense.", "NTA\u2026you have a baby that you\u2019re taking care of through the night?? And your husband is mad because you freaked out thinking something bad was happening and woke him up? Sorry but he needs to grow tf up. A little bit of sympathy to him because his mom is having surgery the next day and he has to take her but for fuck sakes, how was he not a little empathetic to your situation? He needs to get over it. You thought something bad was happening and you needed his support in that moment\u2026whether your worst fears were confirmed or not afterward doesn\u2019t matter.  If my wife did that do me I\u2019d totally understand (and vice versa).", "YTA. Your dog might be the one howling, but your sense of timing is the real scream here!", "YTA\nJust because he's tired doesn't mean sleep will come easy, and there's many reasons. In this case, he is frustrated that his wife dramatically woke him up for no reason. I know for a fact after that argument he was really mad and of course sleepiness may not return to him until hours away. \n\nYou didn't check the dog first, you woke him up. You know your dog has issues, you should've checked then come back to wake your husband if it was an emergency. You didn't consider that he had his mother's surgery to deal with. AH move there. Apologize to him. His argument was valid.", "Are you my ex? Cause I hated you then lmaoooo yta", "It really depends on whether or not your dog screaming is a common occurrence. \nHowever, the way you said you acted to hearing a dog screaming at 4:00 am says it\u2019s normal for that to happen, in which case you should have checked the dog before waking your husband so YTA", "YTA, both for doing everything you did and for not knowing that this makes you TA.", "YTA\n\nYou should have checked on your dog before waking him up.\n\nYou can't tell someone if they are able to fall asleep again or not, I know what it's like to have sleeping isues and trust me it doesn't matter if you wake me up at 1 A.M or 6 A.M I won't be able to fall back asleep after I've been woken up by something. You giving him crap about it and telling him he will be able to sleep if you turn of the wifi makes you an even bigger AH.\n\nHe probably had a hard time falling alseep with the stress of his mothers surgery on his mind and you woke him up for no reason even though you could have checked on the dog and let him sleep!\n\nAlso why did you turn on all the lights?

You owe him an apology and you need to rethink your attitude. Plus, you just need to learn what you're talking about before insulting people.", "YTA, causing that much commotion over a dog making a noise. I feel for your husband as I am also someone who struggles to get back to sleep when woken. You should have checked the dog first and then decided if it was an emergency. To double down on it as well was awful, especially if your husband is taking his mother to surgery in the morning. Shame on you.", "YTA, you check on the dog first, then you act.", "YTA!", "Absolutelt the AH !!", "N T A for waking him up, you were genuinely concerned but YTA for your attitude. Not everyone is able to fall asleep easily. My husband wakes up at 3 am for work, and there have been times he's woken me up by accident, not even with the adrenaline rush your husband must have experienced with the frantic nature of this situation, and I'm up for the rest of the day. Your dismissive attitude towards his inability to sleep and getting unnecessarily aggressive attitude is what makes you TA imo.", "YTA \n\nSo what if it was only 10 seconds? You woke him up in a way he couldn't settle down and sleep and THEN You really doubled down and said he just isn't tired enough. You really suck.", "Lucky you don't keep guns in the house", "Esh. Him for not doing anything about his medical issues and for being an angry jerk that spouts off childish bs when woken. You for not having the foresight to not turn on all the lights when you know he's got something big to do and needs sleep. It honestly sounds like you're tired of him sleeping through everything and it's time to pay him back for it. I'm all about petty little ways to get ppl back, but this wasn't the right time for that. \n\nGood lord, get him to go get a cpap and see a dr for his medical issues. You can also see about dog relaxation stuff that can help soothe the dog throughout the night. \n\nIf yall talk to each other like this often, it isn't normal. Look into counseling.  It may not seem like a big deal, but toxic builds up and ruins lives.", "YTA. You said this is more common so it\u2019s not emergency room visit worthy. He need to get up to take his mom in the morning.", "Yta for your attitude towards him.", "YTA\n\nYou screamed and woke him up because you say you were scared. Fine. That makes sense.\n\nBut you were a bit of a jerk to get aggressive after he told you he can't go back to sleep.\n\n>I bet if I turned the WIFI off, you\u2019d go back to sleep.\n\nwhat was this? you sound like you WANTED to start a fight. You sound like you don't care if he had to stay away. Did you apologize yet? Or do you still think you're right?", "YTA. You didn\u2019t even check on the dog first and he was a bit annoyed but didn\u2019t berate you. You got angry first. And of course he can\u2019t go back to sleep, and you acting like he could if he wanted is so rude. He got ripped from sleep by you and he has to get up early. Thats a combination sure to make most people struggle to go back to sleep", "Maybe NTA for running and turning all the lights on, it'd have scared the toots outta me. But the way you reacted, damn that does  make YTA. I sure know I cannot go back to sleep even if I am in extreme tiredness when I am up, lucky the ones that can.

The important thing is seeing these things and talking to each other before this kind of dynamics become routine.\n\nBTW you mention you were thinking your dog has dementia. Has she/he started having these strange behaviors since you got pregnant or the baby arrived? Because it's very common for dogs to be really stressed by a pregnancy or a new baby in the house. Some get rashes, lose hair on some areas, some start behaving in a strange way. Maybe you already thought about it, but if not - if you have still some energy left - try and read up or talk to your vet about it. There could be some medication for anxiety that could help her, and there are also things you can do like reintroducing daily short training sessions with positive reinforcement for their confidence and making sure their routine is not completely forgotten. I know these are all super hard things to do - my brother has a 7 months old, a cat and two dogs and it's a circus in that house - but just thought I'd mention it since you seem very worried for your dog.", "Yeah I can get being in a bit of a daze when you wake up unexpectedly but like I don't think his reaction was overboard or anything. \n\nDon't be too hard on yourself though as far as AITAH posts it's pretty innocuous.

It's a plastic device that you mold on your teeth and which pushes the jaw forward, allowing better breathing during the night. As far as I can tell it worked for me (I sometimes sleep in a room with several people and they were basically unable to sleep, but after I got the thingy, no one woke me in the middle of the night to tell me I was snoring too loud).
