Adam never stood up for me, despite several conversations. \n\nUnfortunately , my daughter (then 13, now 16) ended up hearing a lot of it and it really hurt her as we\u2019re close. I did my best to keep my kids from Larry but my Adam continued to bring my kids around them. Due to this and many other factors, we divorced. I tried to fight in court that Adam couldn\u2019t bring the kids around Larry and lost. \n\nOne day, Larry went too far shit talking me in front of my daughter (then 14) and she went off on him, defending me and calling him out for his bullying behavior. She later told her dad it was her or Larry and if he didn\u2019t pick her, she\u2019d never go over his house again (at the time, I had full custody as my kids were old enough to decide who to live with and picked me). They eventually compromised that my daughter wouldn\u2019t have to be around Larry ever again, but Adam would continue to see him on his own.

With the help of her therapist, She finally told me that when I wasn\u2019t around, Larry would bully her and instigate until she got upset, then her father would ground her or make her apologize. Adam was asked to join therapy and apologized. Adam and our daughter have since began seeing a therapist together to work on their relationship. \n\nWell, Larry died last week of a heart attack. Adam is naturally devestated. The funeral was yesterday. My daughter refused to go. I told my daughter she didn\u2019t have to go. My son (15) chose to and I respected that.

Several members of Adam\u2019s family have reached out and told me that I have enabled my daughter in \u201calienating Adam and Larry from each other\u201d and have further allowed her to be disrespectful by allowing her to miss the funeral.

Adam did nothing until your daughter snapped. She\u2019s old enough to decide these kinds of things on her own.", "NTA whatsoever!!!", "NTA. Fantastic parenting though! \nEven as adults we should not be forced to attend funerals we don't feel comfortable going to. \nIt's better not to go, then be forced to lie and be nice about the person being buried.", "Block them all!\n\nNTA", "NTA. But your ex is. And where Larry is, he's in good company.", "NTA, glad he's dead", "NTA I\u2019m sorry your ex doesn\u2019t like that your child set a boundary. Or his family but this old \u201cfamily is everything and screw your feelings\u201d is how toxic people flourish with people enabling them because \u201cfamily\u201d.", "NTA good for your daughter and you for supporting her. Please shield her from his family", "NTA.. your AH ex in laws are the enabler.. enabling that AH to be an AH", "NTA. Did they want her to go and spit on his grave?  Come on ppl. Just because a jerk dies doesn\u2019t mean they are an Angel. If you want to morn him go for it, if not don\u2019t.  For some reason she doesn\u2019t want to visit her bullies grave and it\u2019s not a shock. How can family be so mean and then so shock no one cares when they finally leave and bring the world peace.", "NTA. Definitely callous, but on reading the last sentence I thought, \"well, Adam's family doesn't have to worry about Adam and Larry being alienated from one another anymore!\"", "Just because someone is dead does not mean they become a saint or their deeds disappear or even that you have to automatically forgive them now that they are gone. OP's daughter made a very sane choice. \n\nOP should tell the family that Larry and Adam was alienated from each other because Larry was a bully and Adam was an enabler. \n\nI highly doubt they were alienated, though. It's a narrative that's being build around by the family to villianize OP and daughter.\n\nNTA, OP.", "Dad will be wondering why he\u2019s not walking daughter down the aisle on her wedding day.", "I disagree about that ultimatum resulting in him picking Larry first and picking Larry first in general. I think it's more he didn't commit to either one 100%.\n\nI'm sorry but it's not easy to just completely abandon someone in your immediate family you grew up with such as a parent or a sibling. There's normally a lot of history and years there plus a wolfpack mentality can develop if you grow up in the same house.\n\nDo I think Adam should have gotten his daughter away from Larry sooner based on the info we are given? No doubt.\n\nBut I can't sit here and say trying to keep Larry in his life makes him a bad person. A lot of families have that one relative or in-law that some others can't stand", "Being surrounded by her abusers enablers while they tearfully reminisce about \u201cwhat a great guy\u201d he was, could also be incredibly traumatic for the daughter. They already feel like it\u2019s the daughter\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d that her dad pulled back from Larry\u2019s BS - I doubt they\u2019d be nice to a 16 year old that wasn\u2019t sad about his loss and was upset about being forced to celebrate his life.", "By the same assholes who raised Larry to be an asshole.", "NTA for the reasons above", "I agree.. he died an AH", "Yeah this really pisses me off. She was generous to give him the choice and he still found a way around it. Dad was complicit the entire time so I don\u2019t see why he should be seen as any better than the uncle.", "mm that's a good point.", ">Adam was devastated by the loss, so obviously (for whatever unexplained reason) Larry meant a lot to him. \n\nNot an Adam fan, but I'll concede it's also possible Adam was emotionally abused and manipulated by Larry his entire life and is just coded with the mindset of \"we keep Larry happy at all costs.\"", "If we are speculating, perhaps both were emotionally abused, and Larry (even with all his faults) was the only to to stick up for/defend him, and they just grew up handling it differently, personality-wise."]}
