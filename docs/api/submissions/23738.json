During our marriage, Larry was the BIL from hell. Constantly boundary stomping, picking at people until they got upset and then gaslighting them, etc. He grew to dislike me as I was one of the few to call him on his shit and tell him to stop. I kept telling Adam we should go low/!no contact and he refused. Larry then began shit talking time me to everyone. Adam never stood up for me, despite several conversations. \n\nUnfortunately , my daughter (then 13, now 16) ended up hearing a lot of it and it really hurt her as we\u2019re close. I did my best to keep my kids from Larry but my Adam continued to bring my kids around them. Due to this and many other factors, we divorced. I tried to fight in court that Adam couldn\u2019t bring the kids around Larry and lost. \n\nOne day, Larry went too far shit talking me in front of my daughter (then 14) and she went off on him, defending me and calling him out for his bullying behavior. She later told her dad it was her or Larry and if he didn\u2019t pick her, she\u2019d never go over his house again (at the time, I had full custody as my kids were old enough to decide who to live with and picked me). They eventually compromised that my daughter wouldn\u2019t have to be around Larry ever again, but Adam would continue to see him on his own. My daughter entered therapy shortly after and didn\u2019t see Larry after that. With the help of her therapist, She finally told me that when I wasn\u2019t around, Larry would bully her and instigate until she got upset, then her father would ground her or make her apologize. Adam was asked to join therapy and apologized. Adam and our daughter have since began seeing a therapist together to work on their relationship. \n\nWell, Larry died last week of a heart attack. Adam is naturally devestated. The funeral was yesterday. My daughter refused to go. I told my daughter she didn\u2019t have to go. My son (15) chose to and I respected that. I did make sure my daughter was positive she didn\u2019t want to go, and she stood firm, taking several days to mull it over. We also had a discussion on sometimes we do things we don\u2019t want to for those we care about which also lead to a great conversation on boundaries and I ultimately respected her choice. If it\u2019s relevant, the funeral fell on my custody day. \n\nAdam is pissed at me that I didn\u2019t force my daughter to go. I said that given the circumstances, she shouldn\u2019t have to go. Several members of Adam\u2019s family have reached out and told me that I have enabled my daughter in \u201calienating Adam and Larry from each other\u201d and have further allowed her to be disrespectful by allowing her to miss the funeral.

Funerals are for the living and I have quite a few friends/family members who don\u2019t do funerals and are quite vocal about it.

Because let's be honest his \"compromise\" of daughter never having to be around Larry but Adam still could have separate relationship with Larry is basically saying I WON'T pick you.

She said she doesn\u2019t need it for closure.", "Had that compromise come along sooner, things may have been different, who knows? I\u2019m just a random opinion. We don\u2019t know the family history, but Larry is (was) his brother, and Adam was devastated by the loss, so obviously (for whatever unexplained reason) Larry meant a lot to him.  That being said, by no means was Larry\u2019s behavior appropriate, and as I said, that compromise should\u2019ve come a lot sooner. However, I think it goes too far for the daughter to give an ultimatum that he has to sever contact with his brother, or lose her.  She really has no right to make that demand of him when she\u2019s not around.! I am not going to belittle the severity of bullying, but that ultimatum seems over the top, and the compromise seems appropriate.", "Oh well I guess she has thought about it too. Well either way, I'm sorry that you and your daughter had to go through that toxicity. no one deserves it."]}
