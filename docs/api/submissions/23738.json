Adam never stood up for me, despite several conversations. \n\nUnfortunately , my daughter (then 13, now 16) ended up hearing a lot of it and it really hurt her as we\u2019re close.

I tried to fight in court that Adam couldn\u2019t bring the kids around Larry and lost. \n\nOne day, Larry went too far shit talking me in front of my daughter (then 14) and she went off on him, defending me and calling him out for his bullying behavior. She later told her dad it was her or Larry and if he didn\u2019t pick her, she\u2019d never go over his house again (at the time, I had full custody as my kids were old enough to decide who to live with and picked me).

Adam was asked to join therapy and apologized. Adam and our daughter have since began seeing a therapist together to work on their relationship. \n\nWell, Larry died last week of a heart attack.
