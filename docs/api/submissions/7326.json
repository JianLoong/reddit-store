There are 2 reasons you are the exception to the rule of dishonoring a commitment. First and foremost, you're giving Tim plenty of time to find an alternative sitter. You would be an AH if you sprung this on him and he was stuck because he couldn't find anyone in time, for 7 dogs even a month's notice probably wouldn't be enough. The second reason is you don't want to derail your future for someone else's vacation.

I understand that you're feeling upset and frustrated about the situation with your stepbrother \"Tim\". It can be difficult to navigate family dynamics and make decisions that are best for everyone involved. It sounds like you made a commitment to Tim to look after his dogs while he and his family went on vacation, but an opportunity for a paid internship that aligns with your career goals came up and it conflicts with your commitment. It's understandable that you would want to take this opportunity, especially as it's in a field you want to specialize in. It's important to remember that you made a decision based on what you believe is best for the dogs and your own personal growth. It's not easy to disappoint someone, but it's important to prioritize your own well-being and future. I hope things will work out with your stepbrother and the rest of your family.", "NTA.

But that isn't why she is bailing.", "Just tell him, \"Yes, I am selfish.\"  Just agree with everything he calls you.  It's hard to argue with someone agreeing with you.  It doesn't matter what he says, just agree.\n\nSummer is a long way off.  He has plenty of time to make other arrangements.  Life happens.  I never make promises.  Something may come up you didn't expect.  He's playing entitled.\n\nNTA", "Nta. You have to be selfish with your future and your career.", "NTA. You are giving plenty of notice. Help him post the opportunity with the nearest colleges and tech schools; plenty of students can be oriented to the care the dogs need. \n\nInternships will advance your career. \n\nIf you have to, innocently suggest a kennel reservation. I pay $40 per day for mine to have superb care. Think of him multiplying that by seven dogs for 14 days.

THey have ENOUGH time to find someone else.", "NTA.\n\nHowever As someone with multiple pets and one with health issues, it\u2019s reassuring to have my sibling involved in their care when I\u2019m away.\n\nI\u2019ve learned from others with multiple pets that using multiple people who work together makes pet sitting multiple pets a more manageable option on the pet sitters part so I just wanted to offer the ideas below to potentially discuss w brother.  (For some pet owners.-me included- it\u2019s very hard to leave your pets even for a vacation.) \n\nThe possibility  to do what you need to do and work with a second pet sitter or even two other pet sitters to all work together to cover the needs of the pets. Possibly with you stopping in unannounced to check on everything. This will also allow your brother to safely (and more cheaply) explore having another pet sitter or two in the mix that becomes approved by you, or managed by you, someone he trusts, so they the pets won\u2019t feel abandoned or scared by their primary families absence and/or brother feels safer leaving them. \n\nHis brother can also do this without you by starting to train a couple pet sitters right now so that the pets and the family are comfortable with care/the person by the time the family goes on vacation although I\u2019m sure he would also feel better if you are willing to drop in sometimes when they are away just to make sure. I\u2019m always nervous to leave my pets with people who don\u2019t know their idiosyncrasies very well, especially if they have health issues. Either way they should definitely start looking into this of course but I had my pets for years without thinking of using multiple pet sitters working together so I just wanted to put that out there. \n\nCongrats on your internship and I hope your brother manages to work out a way for pets and his family to become more secure about this vacation.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  At first I was going to vote the other way but saw that it's not until summer that Tim will be going on vacation.  Tim has more than enough time to figure out how to take care of his 7 dogs (2 with medical issues).  It's not like OP left him in the lurch here.\n\nI have a feeling the only option Tim is going to have is to put the dogs in a kennel for the vacation as who would ever consider dog-sitting 7 dogs for 2 weeks?  I can see that not being financially feasable so I understand he's in a bit of a pickle here.\n\nBut ultimately, Tim decided to get 7 dogs and figuring out what to do with them when he wants to go on vacation is totally on him.", "NTA. You are at a time in your life where you need to jump on this kind of opportunity, and you are giving him five months to find someone else. He can replace you as a dog sitter a lot more easily than you can replace an offer for a paid internship that could mean the world for your career. I think he is just panicking because he knows that two weeks with 7 dogs, two of which need special care, is way too big an ask for most people. He needs to board those two dogs with a vet and find someone else to take care of the other five.", "NTA, the internship will help your career, and fund your college.  You gave Tim at least 5 months notice to find someone else.  It\u2019s not like flaked out the week before.", ">Tim is now angry with me and said that I made a commitment to him first and I should honor it. He said I'm being selfish.\n\nThis actually pisses me off. No, you don't turn down a paid internship in your field so your step sibling can go on vacation. He chose to have seven dogs. I doubt whatever he is paying you for two weeks would equal what you earn all summer. NTA.", "NTA it's illegal for any employer to prevent you from bettering yourself.  Which he technically is given he's paying you but what's better on the resume?  Walking dogs for two weeks or going on an internship?  You don't owe Tim.  You've given him plenty of time.", "Nta he still has plenty of time to find a dog sitter", "No OP cannot.", "I included that because it wouldn't have been possible for me to look after the dogs and attend the internship (which is close by) at the same time. If Tim just had one or two dogs, doing both simultaneously would be more doable.", "NTA - you gave him plenty of time to find someone new.  If this was a month before y w b t a, but it's not.  Sometimes things come up.", "Nta. 7 dogs?? Geez", "NTA\u2026sorry, but Tim knows he is going to have to pay someone way more than what he was going to pay you to watch 7 dogs for two weeks.  That is what he is really upset about.  You have given him plenty of notice to find other care.  And who wouldn\u2019t take on a paid internship in their field?  Tim should be saying congratulations and I will find other care.", "NTA but you should try and help him find a replacement.", "You committed. YTA for not finding an acceptable to Tim replacement.", "NTA\n\nThis opportunity is for your career, Tim (my dog's name is Tim FYI haha) is just being an ass because he probably doesn't want to pay boarding for 7 dogs, 2 of which are sick.\n\nAlso I used to dog sit my neighbors 6 dogs, it wasn't a lot of work at all . They had acreage to run on all day and when I brought them in in the evening they went to their preferred spot. Simple. Well and none of them were sick either.", "ESH, you for backing out of an agreement, him for not being open to compromise\n\nyou could offer to pay half off whichever person you find to replace you", "NTA. You are giving him plenty of time. Unfortunately vacations are hard to do when you have SEVEN DOGS.", "NTA \n>One of her kids, my stepbrother \"Tim\" (M30s) (I couldn't think of a better name sorry lol), lives with his wife and 2 kids.

Can\u2019t imagine how much \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9 is in the back yard!", "eh, I wouldn't really class leaving a beloved pet with a trusted family member (even paid) as \"doing business with family.\"  I think this was a reasonable arrangement but the stepbrother needs to respect her need to back out with plenty of notice.  This could have happened with a professional booked this far out as well.  People's lives change.  Sometimes you have to adapt.", "That was the point.  If a professional canceled, he likely would have sucked it up, barring maybe a poor yelp review.  But because FaMIlY, he gets to give her grief for years to come.", "Shit you adopt 7 dogs you deal with not being able to go on vacation. That\u2019s the price you pay of becoming a pet owner, specifically a pet owner of 7. NTA", "This is the problem with making commitments so far in advance--circumstances change. The advantage is that Tim has plenty of time to arrange an alternative. And if he can afford a family, a house, a vacation and seven dogs, I'm guessing he can afford a sitter. I have six cats and tbh I don't think I'm ever going to be able to leave the house for longer than overnight ever again....\n\nIt's unfortunate but you're NTA for not wanting to pass up the internship.", "NTA. An internship looks great on your resume. Pet sitting not so much", "NTA\n\nThis is a totally reasonable reason to change your plans and you're giving him a ton of notice. Why isn't he excited and happy for you getting this great opportunity?", "INFO - Did he rely on your agreement to make any non-refundable bookings? Finding affordable care for 7 dogs (including 2 with special needs) would pbly be a deal breaker for many vacation plans.  I do think it's important for you to take the internship,  but I also can understand him being upset if he booked a cruise or something based on your agreement and now he can't get his money back and might need to spend an extra thousand bucks or more on boarding fees.", "NTA, plenty of notice and for a really good reason. But if it's possible, could you offer to split the job with someone? Get a dog walker to handle days, and you come at night for an evening walk and to handle giving the medications? Maybe a friend you know and trust so you know you won't wind up doing everything?", "You definitely shouldn\u2019t turn down the internship, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m seeing a real conflict here (assuming Tim lives nearby). You go to work, come home, and take care of the dogs. A dog walker comes by once or twice a day while you\u2019re at work. No, maybe not practical long term, but for two weeks it doesn\u2019t seem like that big of a deal.\n\nYou have given Tim plenty of notice, but at the same time I\u2019m not a huge fan of backing out on a commitment just because it\u2019s become a bit inconvenient. If your internship required you to move away for the summer, sure, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case. I\u2019m guessing Tim has started spending money on hotels and tickets based on your agreement.", "Uh\u2026 this doesn\u2019t make any sense. So, you could decide to just go back to college and expect your boss to let you use work hours to study and attend class?\n\nIf you\u2019re talking about activities outside of work hours, then obviously your employer can\u2019t control that\u2026 why even mention it?", "Skip the middleman and just dump the kibble on the lawn", "NTA. That's plenty of notice.", "He does know it\u2019s January, right?", "NTA, he is the selfish one that wants you to pass up a good opportunity for your career. Do what's best for you, as he doesn't obliviously care about you.", "NTA your career is more important, bye stepbro", "Honestly, the second I read 7 dogs it was NTA. \n\nBut with the details it is even more NTA.", "NTA, unless if you're from down under he has plenty of time to make alternative arrangements.", "NTA. He has more than enough time to find another pet sitter. But I imagine he's furious because pet care for this many dogs, plus two with severe health issues will probably cost 2-3x what the vacation does. And just so you know--as someone who works in the industry, if he was offering to pay you anything less than $1500 for this it was not a \"decent amount of money\". \n\nBut because this is family and it would be an enormous financial burden perhaps you could see if one of your fellow vet students would be willing to take the job.", "NTA. Furthering your career is the obvious and right priority. Perfectly justifiable reason to cancel your commitment. It would be understandable for Tim to be upset, but to call you selfish??? If that's not hypocritical.... Tim can join the entitled AH line to the left.", "SERIOUSLY. I have three biggish dogs (about 45, 55, and 85 lbs), and I pick up SO MUCH DOG SHIT. Every damn day. (And I really don't understand my very nice next-door neighbor, who has just one 65-ish lb dog, and doesn't appear to pick up his yard AT ALL.
