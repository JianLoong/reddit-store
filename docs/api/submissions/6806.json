I sleep naked. My husband has been sleeping in my spare room bc I just had surgery and it's hard to sleep with someone else in the bed. So I wake up alone from my bed, walk out NUDE (except for my surgical bandages) to the kitchen and on the way back I see a MAN I DO NOT KNOW on my couch. After screaming and feeling real actual terror at the sight of someone I don't know laying there just staring up at me, I hear my husband yell from the spare room \"oh yeah my friend is here he needed a place to crash\". \n\nSo my first instinct is to RUN INTO My room and grab my phone and my husband is already texting me \"by the way he's crashing here tonight\" and I just start yelling \"NO NO NO NO NO\" while getting dressed. \n\nI go to the spare room and tell my husband I want him out. I don't know who he is and I don't know why he's here and I want him gone. I go back to my room. I then hear my husband going on a rant in the living room about me being a \"fucking bitch\" and a \"stupid cunt\" and they both leave.\n \nMy husband starts texting me from the car that i'm a monster with no empathy who just sent someone out to freeze on the streets (it is NOT COLD, I'm currently outside in a T shirt). At this point I still have no info on why this guy was there. This text from my husband makes me think this guy was homeless and I start to sob uncontrollably thinking I am a monster. Also my best friend died 7 years ago by freezing to death so the freezing comment gets to me even though it's not even cold. \n\nThen in between my husband calling me a stupid bitch and a heartless asshole I find out the guy is NOT HOMELESS and just \"had a fight with his baby mama\". I tell my husband I'm not running a flop house for every dude from his past who gets drunk and fights with his girlfriend. \nThat's not something usual in our lives. \n\nI still can't shake the feeling I did something wrong or am heartless for reacting the way I did, and yet my emotions at at a 10 from the experience of finding a stranger in my house as a woman when I was alone and naked. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673182821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106ipee/aita_for_kicking_a_man_who_is_a_stranger_to_me/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't matter if you sleep in the buff or with full length pjs, you have a right to know if there is a stranger in your house who might disturb you in the middle of the night.
