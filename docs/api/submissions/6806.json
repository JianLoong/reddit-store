I sleep naked. My husband has been sleeping in my spare room bc I just had surgery and it's hard to sleep with someone else in the bed. So I wake up alone from my bed, walk out NUDE (except for my surgical bandages) to the kitchen and on the way back I see a MAN I DO NOT KNOW on my couch. After screaming and feeling real actual terror at the sight of someone I don't know laying there just staring up at me, I hear my husband yell from the spare room \"oh yeah my friend is here he needed a place to crash\". \n\nSo my first instinct is to RUN INTO My room and grab my phone and my husband is already texting me \"by the way he's crashing here tonight\" and I just start yelling \"NO NO NO NO NO\" while getting dressed. \n\nI go to the spare room and tell my husband I want him out. I don't know who he is and I don't know why he's here and I want him gone. I go back to my room. I then hear my husband going on a rant in the living room about me being a \"fucking bitch\" and a \"stupid cunt\" and they both leave.\n \nMy husband starts texting me from the car that i'm a monster with no empathy who just sent someone out to freeze on the streets (it is NOT COLD, I'm currently outside in a T shirt). At this point I still have no info on why this guy was there. This text from my husband makes me think this guy was homeless and I start to sob uncontrollably thinking I am a monster. Also my best friend died 7 years ago by freezing to death so the freezing comment gets to me even though it's not even cold. \n\nThen in between my husband calling me a stupid bitch and a heartless asshole I find out the guy is NOT HOMELESS and just \"had a fight with his baby mama\". I tell my husband I'm not running a flop house for every dude from his past who gets drunk and fights with his girlfriend. \nThat's not something usual in our lives. \n\nI still can't shake the feeling I did something wrong or am heartless for reacting the way I did, and yet my emotions at at a 10 from the experience of finding a stranger in my house as a woman when I was alone and naked. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Who doesn\u2019t tell their spouse that there\u2019s someone ON THEIR COUCH so they are not surprised?!\n\nOP you have a bigger problem with your husband jumping to calling you all kinds of names. He wouldn\u2019t be my husband any longer.", "Which is why I said its similar, they are both inviting people around to sleep it their house in a public area without permissions who also happen to be drunk. Its worse for the husband because he invited a stranger to the house, but then we don't know if he knows everyone she has invited around", ">I have only ever gone out for drinks with friends and then let my husband know before coming home that someone was staying over before then getting into the same bed with him to sleep. He also doesn't sleep naked.\n\nThat is not what you said.\n\n>He's insisting that he could have woken up any of those times and found a strange woman on the couch and it would be the same.\n\nIf you let him know then why would he be shocked to find a strange women?\n\njust because people think you are wrong about something doesn't mean you can change the context of what you wrote.", "Just because he is wrong doesn't mean you are right. You both suck. OK so you freaked out, but then when you had context you should have stopped freaking out. \n\nESH", "Then yea that's a key difference, informed consent", "Ignored the edit and comment below I see", "Ok. I don't know your husband and I don't know your relationship, but this sounds a lot like he found a painful wound of yours and deliberately shoved his fingers into it in order to benefit himself/his friend. Have there been other times when he's used a vulnerability or an honesty of yours against you?", "No its not. She's telling him before hand. \n\n\"We can assume that is immaterial because he's probably asleep.\" \n\nShe still texted him. Before hand. Whether he was asleep or not doesn't matter. He didn't say anything UNTIL she sees a strange man sleeping on her couch at 4AM. Completely different precedent.", "Omg absolutely not my husband has never touched a drug in his life. He doesn't even drink lol", "What? Her husband texted her after she found out that there was a man inside of her house? He also brought him in the middle of the night while she was asleep? I feel like texting your partner beforehand before coming home and bringing someone with you is different from bringing someone in your house in the middle of the night without saying anything then telling her after the fact. It's reasonable to think a partner would check their phone to see where their partner is and also see that someone is coming with them. It's unreasonable to check your phone at 4am to see if your partner, who has been home the whole time, brought a stranger inside.", "Your mom needs to chill\n\n\nGrow up", "Her being fully entitled to do so doesn't make her less of an asshole.", "My husbands way of saying \"it's the same\" isn't even about informing him, because he knows I do inform him. He's trying to say that because he might not have met the friend before it's the same thing and therefore she would be a \"stranger\" in the house to him (even though he knows she's coming). So I can't be mad about a \"stranger\" because sometimes my friends are strangers to him when sleeping over, even though he knows they're coming. The more I think about this I do not think it's the same and I'm growing angrier.", "When does she though? If she texts him, then the first he hears of it is after the fact isnt it?\n\nThere are 2 precedents. One is that people that the other person doesnt know can stay over at the place if they need a place. That one has already been broken.\n\nThe second is re informing the other party. You dont know when the friend arrived or what the husband was doing. Maybe he was gonna tell his wife. Maybe he felt the precedent was that he always learnt about it after the fact so its the same.", "I'd be ASTONISHED if that was the only time he has called OP that.", "*still* freaking out", "Nope i disagree. He finds out about it after the fact. People he doesn't know sleeping on his couch.\n\nAnd im gonna bet this is his first time bringing someone over while for her its a far more regular thing. Again, you do not know when his friend arrived. So 4am doesnt matter. I see it as the same precedent that it is ok to inform the other party after the fact.", "I was wondering why he\u2019d behave that way. \n\nIs he often verbally abusive?", "So, he spoke to you like that sober? To his naked, vulnerable wife recovering from surgery who had a shock in the middle of the night. \n\nIt\u2019d make me look at my partner in a (horrible) new light if he ever treated me like that, screamed those vile words at me and about me to his friend then doubled down with texts and behaviour. \n\nNTA.", "Ah yes, the one making \"your mom\" jokes is telling people to grow up.", "This isn't an asshole move if she didn't agree with his staying first.\n\nNTA", "It's not the same! He put you in a terrible situation where you walked out *naked* and a stranger is in your house. That is inexcusable. Then he hurls awful, nasty words at the person whom he should love and protect. It's not ok.", "Is your comment pure speculation or did OP say somewhere that she is informing her husband via text? \n\nBecause it certainly seems like pure speculation to me. And based on her post, her husband is pretty abusive. So you're just defending an abusor with speculation.... congrats! You sound like just as big of a jerk as the AH on this post. Have a great day \u270c\ufe0f", "\"I've only done it two or three times.\" \n\nNot that regular.", "Glad someone could understand.", "If a person needs help you help them. If a friend needs help you help them without questions. If you refuse your partners friend help your both a bad partner and a bad person.\n\nOfc he should've told her someone was coming over, but any response other than \"Ofc we'll help\" is a red flag and totally unacceptable.", "Are you saying this sub isn't 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999% rounded up speculation for every single post?", "Not yet. But it is pure speculation that she calls him beforehand. So you could very well be supporting someone who kicked out someone out of her house who needed a place which well is abusive.\n\nWhats good for the goose is also good for the gander. You have a good day yourself.", "2 or 3 is still more than 0. And her comment on the flop house bit in her post is just a tidy bit hypocritical as well.", ">If a person needs help you help them\n\nHe wasn't kicked out. He had argument with his partner.\n\n>If you refuse your partners friend help your both a bad partner and a bad person.\n\nNope, it isn't. It's called a boundary. She might not feel comfortable around him for example. Grow up from that bs.\n\n>any response other than \"Ofc we'll help\" is a red flag and totally unacceptable.\n\nNo, it isn't. Again - grow up.", "OP said she informs her husband before bringing anyone. It's not speculation.\nAnd kicking out someone she didn't know or wanted there from HER OWN HOME isn't abuse. You just couldn't come up with anything dumber.", "And he was obviously distressed enough to leave, i.e he needed help.\n\nNo, it's called being selfish. Which is always a bad thing.\nAlways put your pain in perspective with others, it might be annoying to you but he was upset enough to ask for help and leave home. Legit, your line if selfish thinking is what's wrong with the world, y'all take 0 responsibility for the well being of others.", ">And he was obviously distressed enough to leave\n\nGood."]}
