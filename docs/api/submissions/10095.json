I am not saying that you should give the photos for less than agreed upon, but a thumb drive is like....10 bucks.  You deleting them was a bad move for family dynamics and relationship as well as plain petty.  It's your cousin, if you were close enough to be asked to do the photos and to spend all day for $50 paid eventually, then you're close enough to call or text her one more time instead of going through a middleman. \n\nThat being said, the cousin was being an AH as well, wanting them for $10 instead of 50.  Also, spending all that time not communicating is AHish on her part.\n\nWhat you did was petty.

For example, I have a lovely photo of me and my aunt carrying my wedding dress to the \"ready room\", and that's the last photo I have of just the 2 of us.

Then there's one with me and my bridesmaids giggling about something, and a really cute one where my mom looks really surprised - we still have no idea what that was about! But it's things like that, that you forget over the years of how you felt in that moment, so people like to have photos of all that, to reminisce about the day. And if you have a really good photographer, they will unobtrusively capture it.\n\nThis is why I tell brides and grooms that if they want to skimp elsewhere, fine, but don't skimp on your photographer.

Wow, your cousin and her family are incredibly entitled. $50 for a full day of work and follow-up photo editing and copying on to disks is dirt cheap.

The fact that she kept avoiding you after the wedding and after her brother told her to get in touch with you when you filled him in shows not only a level of disrespect but also how dishonest she has been with everyone.

Tell them how disappointed you are in your cousin for her dishonesty, lack of respect of your time and effort, her greediness in trying to scam a teenager.  Had she simply responded back to you and indicated her monetary situation you could have worked out a simple payment plan. Six months passed... she could have paid you like $10/month if she was that broke.  Tell them all she only has herself to blame for how she handled the situation and frankly how disappointed you are with her all the rest of her family for treating you badly and not holding her accountable for her actions that created this avoidable situation.\n\nYour mom - needs to step up and defend you!

She can pay. \n\nShe instead chose to fuck around and find out. \n\nShe found out alright.", "NTA\n\nI know a couple where they didn't get their wedding photos from the photographer. 2 years of back and forth the photographer goes 'pay the full money or else I delete them!\"\n\nYea they have no photos and no marriage now.  \n\nGot half the story from the wife which makes it sound like they agreed a set amount and then tried to pay less afterwards thinking they had the upper hand or weren't happy with the quality or something. No idea. Just sounds similar. \n\nProfessional photographers only keep photos on their drives for a set amount of time because they don't have the capacity to keep them longer. A big bump of budget goes on storage but people don't realise because they shoot in raw. While you might get 1000 photos on a smaller size (still talking 2000x3000 pixels) you might get something like 12 raw photos. \n\nYou warned her and she didn't listen. NTA at all and in fact it is really amazing to see you do this. It shows that you have a good head on your shoulders, especially if you want to go into the photography world. \n\nI refuse to do weddings no matter how profitable they are. There are a lot of bridezillas especially when it comes to photography. A full day wedding day from a pro like you are describing with two photographers in 2-3k easy for one wedding, 1,200 minimum for one photographer and she wanted all that for 10... Ekkkk", "NTA\n\nThe bride had 6 months to come up with $50 and clearly she got the family discount. Does anyone know a professional photographer who would do a wedding for $50? \n\nBeing a witch on the day and then ignoring the OP to get her photos. \n\nPlay stupid games. Win stupid prizes.", "Maybe you didn't have to delete the pictures and could've saved them on your computer somewhere in case she ever came around, but you have ample time and notice along with dealing with her BS.  Were you petty? Yes.  Where you the asshole? No.  You were NTA.", "Nope. I\u2019m fact, I\u2019m proud of you. You taught her a valuable lesson. The rest can kick rocks.", "NTA but remember this, that your entire family including your mom believes that others are entitled to your efforts for free.  So any time anyone who's defending this asks for anything that would require a large investment on your part demand pay up front or refuse to do it for them.  Those who defend this are the kind of people who will expect it for themselves as well.  Good on you for standing up for what is right and not letting people use you.", "Clearly they weren't that precious if she could wait 6 months without them.  NTA.", "Absolutely not the AH.  But definitely a learning experience here. Had you been anyone else, and not family, more than likely a contract would have been drafted, signed, and that contract would have been honoured. However, because you are family, someone thought they could take advantage of you. This is the learning point: next time, draft a written invoice, or have a contract in place, ESPECIALLY if it is with family. Oftentimes, family will try to rip you off rather than strangers, because family members will think you will just forgive them, or let things slide. Your cousin wanted to pay you $3.80 an hour. You agreed to this because you thought you were going to do a favour and were trying to be nice. Maybe because of your age, she thought she could take advantage. I have no doubt, had you sent the photos and expected payment later, you would have not received a thing.  Lesson: DTA: Don't trust anyone, including family. Sometimes, especially family.\n\nSecondly, people spend an entire year or more to save up for their wedding. The dress, venue, reception, cake, and photos are all taken into consideration. Want a nicer dress?  Then, you'll have to get a  less fancy cake. Decisions like this are made. Therefore, decisions about photography should have taken place, costs, etc. should have been made long before the wedding even took place. This is called Wedding Planning. If she did not plan for photography or a budget for it, not your issue. She was the bride. That was her job.\n\nThirdly, did they not get any money as wedding gifts? This could have been used to pay you!  She also had 6 months after the wedding to come up with $50. Does she not also have a husband that works? Two adults that can afford a wedding but not $50 for a photographer? \n\nFourthly, if these photos were so precious and once in a lifetime moments, why did she act like she did not care? You reached out to her and got no response. She did not seem to even communicate or contact you to secure those photos. If they were so important, why ignore them for so long? Funny how she only seemed to care after they were gone. You were the one who hung onto them for a long time. You also did edits for her which would have taken hours!  This reduces your $3.80 and hour to maybe half that.\n\nFifthly, what happens to wedding photos after a divorce?  They get burned, destroyed, used as target practice, deleted forever!  If this woman is acting like this towards you, and was a bridezilla at her wedding, her husband will eventually realize what kind of person she is and want out. (Trust me, I had a friend who married a woman like this and they had 2 kids together but was not long until he packed a bag, left her everything and got the eff out) The photos would not be precious anymore or hold any sentimental value anymore, so what difference does it make?", "NTA \n\nAnd deleting them was a brilliant move.\n\nThey can't even argue with anything. \n\nRope dropped.", "This falls into the fuck around and find out scenario.

I do sports photography, mostly free.  A few hours for the game, a few thousand pictures to filter through and select good ones, cropping, minor lighting adjustments, posting to various places online and I'm happy to do it.

If nothing turns out (happened once when I took some pre-game portraits and didn't change shutter speeds for the game), if I get overwhelmed  and don't  get it done in a timely manner, if I just put unprocessed images in an online directory for others to pick through, if I run into someone and have a conversation and miss parts of the game - I don't feel too bad.  And when I see my photos shared or used in promos for teams I like, it feels good.\n\nFor $50, you were essentially free, but felt obligated to be at her beck and call all day and deliver like a professional.

This should teach her a lesson about paying her bills on TIME like a married adult should, but it\u2019s not like the other family members were punished by being left with no photos.

Your cousin and her family treated you as a professional wedding photographer all through the day of the wedding, then put you off as a 'juvenile cousin doing a favor' as soon as she headed off for her honeymoon.\n\nMy father moonlighted as a professional wedding photographer in the 1960's.  He worked for a friend who owned a camera shop and photography studio.  My father spent the day doing everything you described.  He followed the bride throughout the day, from her preparation at her parent's home through the exit from the reception at the end of the day.  He did no production, that was the studio's responsibility.  Dad just took the photos and turned the film over to his friend who owned the business.  \n\nDad made considerably more than $50 pay from his friend for his work.  As he was always personable and professional during the event, the bride's parents often tipped him more than $50.  \n\nThat was more than half a CENTURY ago.\n\nBy agreeing to work for practically nothing, you set yourself up to be taken advantage of by you cousin and her parents.  It was easy for them to go from paying you a token amount to just brushing you off altogether as an amateur who didn't need to be paid.\n\nYour cousin was probably putting you off until you 'came to your senses' and just turned the photos over for nothing.\n\nI applaud you for sticking up for yourself and demanding your cousin honor the agreement you had with her.

I am an amateur, there is no amount they can pay me to make it worth the stress of having it all on me.\n\n2nd)  If they are a close friend I will usually take the pictures in lieu of a gift.  I am gifting them my time and talents and they are usually very happy to get a selection of nice photos.\n\n3rd)  If they are more distant relations, like this situation I will usually ask to be paid a small amount and paid up-front.

Oh, and I never would've let it go for 6 months. I don't blame you one bit for deleting everything. It's not your fault she decided not to pay you!! It's not a financial struggle, either.

You came in here saying ESH but then said cousin was AH, what traditions dictate how one uses an USB drive?", "I still disagree with this take. Because deleting the photos mean wiping your hands clean of the situation entirely. OP has been disrespected over the course of SIX MONTHS, with the cousin\u2019s frequent attempts to low ball and prolong deal by not responding. And you also forget that OP is a teenager who still has other priorities to tend to. Spiteful family members should be at the bottom of their list. If these pictures were so important to the bride & bride\u2019s family in question, the $50 would\u2019ve been given immediately. But clearly she doesn\u2019t care enough about them when she refuses to cover a basic fee. In a professional setting, people like the bride lose out on services when they don\u2019t pay. And I still stand by OP\u2019s decision to delete. While they are not a professional by trade, this has crossed the lines of business and it became personal when she offered a measly $10 for OP\u2019s time and a efforts.

They\u2019re bullies and you know it, this situation would\u2019ve escalated until OP would be forced to hand it over, I\u2019m sure.

I don't understand this logic; when you enter a contract for a paid service, if you don't pay, you don't get that service. \n\nOP got paid $3.57/hr for photos. I would agree with you if OP deleted them after a week, but she waited for half a year. Divide that by $50 and OP got paid $.011/hr. Cousin jerked her around for six months. Cousin clearly doesn't care about the photos because she didn't bother to even look at them or pay. If wedding photos are *so* important for an once-in-a-lifetime event, then cousin would have shelled out $50 after (most likely) spending thousands on the wedding. She didn't care all that much, she just hoped OP would give up and give them to her. OP is NTA.", "Tbh with those kind of people, unless a life altering event happened which they should have communicated to the service provider, they probably aren\u2019t going to be married for long anyway. You probably are going to be holding it for a long long time. It\u2019s their fault for not holding up their end of the bargain. Also it\u2019s only 50 dollars. After being stiffed for 6 months I would take a video of me deleting everything and send the video to them.", "You\u2019re talking about a 17 year old amateur being unprofessional? \n\nDo you charge $50 for a 14 hour wedding? No? It\u2019s illegal if you\u2019re actually a professional? Then why are you talking about professionalism.. if you want professionalism, you pay the $2k a professional charges..\n\nJust because you\u2019re a bit of a fool and hang onto wedding photos for years after they\u2019ve been abandoned \u201cjust in case\u201d doesn\u2019t mean a kid should, too.", "That's not really how per hour works. She wasn't taking pictures all six months.", "I like my prep photos.  I'm getting pampered. I'm relaxed. I have this great photo of my husband trying to snap up my train into the bustle. It's really cute.", "I agree. We got hitched at the recorder\u2019s office and nobody thought to bring a camera. My maid of honor had an old camera in her bag, so she and her partner took turns getting a few shots during the picnic lunch. It was plenty for a photo album we can look at when we\u2019re feeling sentimental about our perfect wedding.\n\nThe amount of headaches she had with the professional she hired for her destination wedding OTOH. Makes me glad I only volunteered for dress-making duty."]}
