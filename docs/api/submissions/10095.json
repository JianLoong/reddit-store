You are definitely in the wrong here.", "I'm going to go with ESH.\n\nWhy?  Because if you were willing to do the whole day for $50, then it's basically free.  I am not saying that you should give the photos for less than agreed upon, but a thumb drive is like....10 bucks.  You deleting them was a bad move for family dynamics and relationship as well as plain petty.  It's your cousin, if you were close enough to be asked to do the photos and to spend all day for $50 paid eventually, then you're close enough to call or text her one more time instead of going through a middleman. \n\nThat being said, the cousin was being an AH as well, wanting them for $10 instead of 50.  Also, spending all that time not communicating is AHish on her part.\n\nWhat you did was petty.

You did everything you could to complete the transaction with no response.\n\nWhat was your cousin's response when you laid out the facts?", "Then point out that she's upsetting you now by not having your back.\n\nAsk her point blank who matters more to her, you, **her own SON**, or her family of bullies?\n\nYour 17 going on 18 soonish, is she *really* willing to let this potentially be what drives you two apart and make you go Low / No Contact with her?\n\nSure right now it's just $50 and wedding photos, but if the bullies \"win\" here, what's it going to be next time? Demanding that you lend them your car and refusing to take responsibility if they crash it? Demanding that you let them stay at your home and ruin the place?\n\nThe time to take a stand is here and now, and your mom HAS to have your back on this, otherwise she's honestly no better then they are. \n\nAlso, next time you offer any kind of service for cash, be it to friends or family, **get it in writing**.

And I hope this doesn't dissuade you from photography altogether. It can be very rewarding and fun. Weddings are about as high stress of a gig as it gets, besides maybe Olympics (jk).

But now your whole family suffers the loss of these photos for 50 dollars. Sometimes it's best to count your losses and instead of 50 dollars you got to see who this person really is.", "I have no idea of the country or culture of this interaction so not willing to overlay US cultural expectations.", "No, she wouldn't. Of course not.\n\nBut it would be fun to send her an invoice every month with the new price for the photos. 3200 after 6 month by the way.\n\nTo call you greedy is nothing less than projection,if not gaslighting.

Good luck, kid, cuz the bridezilla's family is going to call you an asshole as long as they live. Don't listen to 'em.", "Compound interest ftw, though I'd go with 3% compound weekly, with an expiration date of a generous two years, with storage capacity being cleared at midnight of the 2 year mark. Both generous and as professional as can be expected. \n\nOP, next time you make an offer to that side of the family, draft a simple contract that closes whatever loopholes you can think of, and one that lays out the terms should they try to pull this sort of thing again. They'll either not sign and call you cold and heartless, or they'll not have a problem with it and sign since, y'know, they're not gonna try to take advantage of you. Then, if there are problems, you not only have receipts, you have a basis for CYA if they decide to get legal with it.", "Yea I paid 4K and my pictures were shit.

I was a DJ in my 20s and a friend of a friend asked me to DJ her stag n doe and wedding. I told her since she was friends I could do both for $300. She said I should do it for free because I'd get a lot of business from her....I didn't understand the logic at all. My response to her was that I no longer was able to DJ and good luck in finding someone else.

Working for an abusive family member was.\n\nNTA", "Which says \"you owe me 50 bucks\"", "You missed a zero.", "Yeah, it's bad to work or loan money to family members.

Not so much the putting on make up ones.", "Ah yes, the first look, the first bite of the cake, the first chew of the bubble gum, the first hangnail, you name it, there's a wedding ritual for it and it better be perfect OR ELSE!!!!!!\n\nSource: Anecdotes and a bit of facetiousness. I've been in many weddings and hoo boy some of these things are just wild", "Re: the \"getting ready\" photos, as an explanation - they're important to some people, because it's a literal snapshot and story of the day. It's a big event for the bride and groom, and there's also usually relatives there that you might not often see. For example, I have a lovely photo of me and my aunt carrying my wedding dress to the \"ready room\", and that's the last photo I have of just the 2 of us. And I've seen lots of really sweet and candid photos of the bride or groom getting ready, it's not just \"putting on a tie\", and those photos tell the story of the day. \n\nWhen I look at our wedding photos, I love the one of my husband as he's arriving; he's carrying his tux, and he has the biggest smile on his face, I love that photo! Then there's one with me and my bridesmaids giggling about something, and a really cute one where my mom looks really surprised - we still have no idea what that was about! But it's things like that, that you forget over the years of how you felt in that moment, so people like to have photos of all that, to reminisce about the day. And if you have a really good photographer, they will unobtrusively capture it.\n\nThis is why I tell brides and grooms that if they want to skimp elsewhere, fine, but don't skimp on your photographer. You get what you pay for! (And in OP's cousin's case, that was literally true. Yikes!)", "We had a close friend who was an amateur photographer do ours. I couldn\u2019t be bothered with all the stress of millions of staged pics and told him to just do his thing and enjoy his day as a guest and snap away as the mood took him.\nIt was a small ish wedding and our friends and family all shared their pics too. We asked him how much he would like to be paid and there was only one isle malt whiskey he had never tried (or had a bottle of) due to the price and he asked for that. I looked it up expecting it to be the best part of \u00a31000 if not more but was surprised to find they were only about \u00a3200-\u00a3500. We bought him one which he opened and offered out to every one at the wedding so we bought him a 2nd bottle for himself. He handed over all the negatives and printed out all the photos and everything, about 15 rolls of film he had used! He wouldn\u2019t even let us pay him for the film and printing either. There are some crazy pics in there but some real gems and they are wonderful.", "The appeal is in the memories it sparks for you later.", "Part of the book you make afterwards.", "Lovely", "Indeed  but needs the 2nd half before starting the work when op shows up to be certain the job is paid for.", "I'd also be petty enough to put it over every face in photo... But that's just me. Totally not giving advice to OP or others in a similar boat."]}
