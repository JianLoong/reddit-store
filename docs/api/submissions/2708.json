MIL talk poorly about me to my own children and tells family our very very personal business. She accused me of stealing from her house. Called me useless because I don\u2019t work (have 2 small children).

She\u2019s off her rocker in so many ways. She allowed her other two (much older) children to sell drugs out of her home while my husband was a child and he was exposed to a lot of violence because of it. Anyway, we had a daughter and I made it very clear before she was born that she would not be allowed to see her. Daughter is 2 now and I\u2019ve stuck to my guns. She\u2019s only seen her twice and the first time was shortly after birth while COVID was very heavy and she had the audacity to kiss my child on the face after I asked specifically to stay away from her face.
