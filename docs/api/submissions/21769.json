Silly me, it's misogyny.\n\nDefinite red flags, especially when trying to stop you from preparing for something\n\nThe way you describe things, the spontaneous outings seem to be things that are quite involved and require a modicum of planning. It's not like a spontaneous, \"Let's pull over by the water and watch the sun set before we go home\" or \"let's eat somewhere we've never tried because it's right there and we're here\" or whatever\n\nEither way, not a fan of this person!", "One can be spontaneous - and still prepare? Like, at some point a decision is made to go to\nX location. At that point, it\u2019s worth it to turn off the road and stop at a market for essentials. That doesn\u2019t destroy the spontaneous spirit, it keeps you alive.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

Good thing you broke up with him, he sounds annoying AF.", "Get yourself a man who respects you", "Nta you\u2019re not going to be able to convince people other wise if he is just making stuff up, you should just be happy you dodged a major red flag. Being happy is the best revenge.", "NTA...Will sounds like a  toddler", "NTA\n\nMy dad is a very spontaneous person and my mom is not, and when they first started dating, my dad introduced her to hiking and skiing, etc. but he was a prepared spontaneous person to where he always packed a backpack to go hiking with and made sure to pack beer and snickers bars for the top of whatever mountain they climbed. And my mom eventually learned to always keep a pair of hiking shoes in the car for random hikes.\n\nBeing spontaneous is fine and should be encouraged, but the key to being spontaneous is being spontaneously prepared for the spontaneous.", "You are clearly not compatible.\n\nHad he not whined and suffered his lack of preparedness I would have said no assholes but he whines. Which means you are NTA", "NTA. His type of spontaneous sounds dangerous, if it\u2019s out in the heat with no water. Seems like you\u2019re better off.", "Spontaneity isn\u2019t lack of preparedness. My husband woke up one day, discovered a rare bird alert 3.5 hours from our house, and decided we were going to day trip.

He wanted a mommy and be able to behave like a 7 year old.", "NTA This honestly sounds emotionally abusive. He wanted to put you in situations that he knew you would feel uncomfortable, then berated you for plan around them like any normal person would.

Even people who had been hunting in the area for decades got lost and died on hunting trips where they underprepared for the amount of time they ended up spending in the elements. Let alone the people who think they can manage an all-day up-hill hike with zero experience and a granola bar (speaking a bit from experience here lmao). Spontaneity is for restaurants and theme parks, not heat stroke.", "Average walking trail in Florida. It\u2019s hot AF here too right now", "To be fair: a spontaneous outdoor activity could also be going to the park.

That\u2019s a mindf right there\u2026isn\u2019t the point of NB to not go through the masculine/feminine BS?\n\nAnyway NTA, you dodged a bullet. I don\u2019t think this person wanted anything nor would they know what they want. You can only wish someone like this the best on their journey and steer clear imho.\n\nDon\u2019t worry what they\u2019re telling people, it wouldn\u2019t make sense anyway. He simply does not make sense.", "It sounds like you were dating a toddler to be honest because who else has that little self-awareness. I'm glad you've dumped him.", "Will is a fool. This is silly.

And real immature.", "NTA (though you probably saw that coming!).\n\nAre you sure you\u2019ve substituted \u2018spontaneous\u2019 for \u2018stoopid\u2019, as that\u2019s what Willy-babes is.

I too was more mature at 7 then my parents. I too always have food in my purse, go back in my car with everything I might ever need in it. I\u2019m guessing you also have problems getting your brain to stop assessing everyday situations like you\u2019re still a kid. Cptsd, these are absolutely trauma responses and very valid. I read that you know this too. I just came here to say that I hope you are in therapy. It\u2019s a hard long road but you don\u2019t always have to be in control. (Not excusing the bf asshat behavior) you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice. You\u2019re missing out on parts in life like the ability to truly relax with another person in the area or being adventurous and going with the flow. If you want to have \nchild/ren this is absolutely vital. I hope that you find the happiness you deserve.

If none of this pertains to you my apologies.", "It's true that those I've got through scrapes with are now the closest people to me, and that some of my fondest memories are overcoming hardship with someone. However deliberately trying to get into some kind of a jam? That's crazy behaviour!\n\nNTA", "I think you need to do some introspection on why you chose a man just like your parents to date.\n\nTrauma has an evil way of demanding that we keep repeating our trauma instead of healing. I think some therapy for you (EMDR is working well for me) may help.  And I encourage you to be wary of the things you accept in choosing friends and dates. You will need to change your choices if you want to change your life. \n\nAnd btw, always being in control of every aspect of your life is overrated.

NTA.", "You can spontaneously go to places like that... if you consider getting prepared part of doing it and the spontaneity is you decided then start to get prepared immediately.\n\nBut jesus christ this guy was against buying a bottle of water because it ruined the spontaneity wtf", "Yes. Spontaneous is calling your favorite restaurant or hotel seeing if they have any reservations last minute or wandering through the hip part of town planning to hit up whatever restaurant looks interesting and has a wait time that feels worth it. Spontaneous is taking a day off work to do a 2 mile hike because its the first good day of weather in the spring (and we already, as non-spontaneous people, had a spreadsheet of nearby hikes with the total time including round trip travel to know we could be back to pick up our kids on time) and then deciding to do the full 5 miles, since we have enough water and snacks and sunscreen and time to make it work.\n\nSpontaneous is not lets go be stupid together and hope we can get out of it somehow", " I can imagine. He seems to have a very childish view of \"spontaneity.\" If you wake up and want to go hiking, you can still gather the things you need and plan a route, you don't have to just jump up and go with absolutely no plan. That works walking around a town window shopping and getting lunch, but doing it on a hike can be deadly. Definitely NTA.", "I highly recommend therapy. You\u2019re right, that kind of childhood trauma has a way of staying with you, and working through it with a therapist is one of the kindest things you can do for yourself.\n\nNTA.

Then when we go somewhere, he\u2019s pretty happy I brought whatever it was bc he didn\u2019t think of it. \n\nHe makes fun of what I have in my purse. There\u2019s a 25\u2019 tape measure, a small crescent wrench that fits the battery cable on the car, Neosporin ointment, 2 pocket knives, a needle in a spool of thread, pens, ofc my wallet, a small bottle of Tylenol. Plus some other assorted shit I need. \n\nGot made fun of at work about the tape measure, until we needed to measure a doorway. Hahahaha", "That is so so scary. Glad you kept your head on your shoulders and got out of there!", "Emotional abuse comes in many forms.  He probably wasn't aware, but who cares?", "Yes, it's so weird to say an activity isn't spontaneous if you grab a drink to take with you - does he know what spontaneous means? Is he confusing it with thirsty?", "Yeah, spontaneous doesn't mean deliberately being unprepared. My college roommate and I took spontaneous trips on weekends. We'd decide to go, get packed and stop at the store for supplies. We could be ready in 20 minutes and take another 20 minutes at the store. We'd be gone in less than an hour, and still be fully prepared.", "Which makes it all the more ironic that he was the one that ended up complaining. She dodged a bullet this one!", ">isn\u2019t the point of NB to not go through the masculine/feminine BS?\n\nNB doesn't necessarily mean androgynous.

I carry some weird shit, too!", "He's not compatible with you - and probably nobody else, either!", "Lol exactly my thought!", "More feminine also does not mean being more prepared.
