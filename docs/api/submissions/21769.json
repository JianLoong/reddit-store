This was long before all-inclusive resorts were a thing (I'm 57F). In addition to our flights, I pre-paid the hotel and their optional 3-meals-a-day plan.

Also I wasn't taught the first thing about being a functional adult, to this day neither of my parents knows anything about being a functional adult and they live in squalor and mayhem. Again it was a choice, so for him to put that on me really pissed me off, especially because he himself grew up with 2 functional parents and in a community full of functional adults.

So....", "Where do you see that OP hid it?  She couldn't have been more upfront, and clear. What does she need to do? Write it on a brick, and smash his face with it?", "Exactly.
