Don't expect anything in return, because she would need help to get the stuff and send it.  I sent my nephew cards every 6 - 8 weeks  for a year before he got a phone.   I would include things like photos of his cousins or Pok\u00e9mon cards, stickers,  a garbage pail kid card,  anything that I thought would be funny or cool."]}
