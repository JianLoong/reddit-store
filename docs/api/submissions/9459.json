The other day in conversation they asked me (22F) if It would bother me if they decided to go through with this surgery. This question really took me by surprise because we talked about body dysphoria/gender expression/transitioning a lot, I\u2019ve always been pumped about attending queer events together. I always love hearing about their thoughts and feelings. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d ever think it would bother me.\n\nI replied that I didn\u2019t care what their body looked like or whether in the future they had breasts or not. I elaborated that whether it was a body modification/haircut/name/gender I was their friend because of who they were as a person and no matter what they chose to do I\u2019d still be there for them. I also said that it was a decision that should not be influenced by my opinion nor anyone else\u2019s because what is most important was their mental health and what makes them feel the best about themselves. I also said my only care was them feeling sure and being safe, because it is an intensive surgery and recovery.\n\nThe conversation sort of ended after that. They went back to their room and we haven\u2019t really spoken since. The house is tense. I don\u2019t really know where exactly I went wrong. I was really trying to express that I loved them for who they were and our friendship would never be affected by how they looked or the way they choose to identify, but I feel like it somehow came off as the opposite. Im thinking maybe it was when I said any body modification or any haircut. Maybe that made the surgery seem superficial or unimportant? Idk, please offer insight.

You were doing your best to be supportive and express your views. \nMaybe the comparison wasn't the best, but if a clumsy comparison is what your friend stumbled over and the talk went as you said: they should be adult enough to a) express what they didn't like or b) be empathic enough to understand that their friend didn't mean to hurt them.\n\nI do think you should talk to them, see what's wrong, and also mention that this is not an okay way to deal with conflict in a household.", "NTA, but for god's sake go tell them that you're concerned that your expression of acceptance and love for them came out wrong and apologize instead of sitting there waiting and wondering.", "You are asking the wrong people. Ask your friend.", "NTA. \n\nYou seem like a supportive friend.\n\nI don't understand why they would be upset with you either, but it can't hurt to just straight up ask them whats on their mind.", "NTA. I don't think this really has much to do with gender. I think your friend was annoyed that 1) you weren't enthusiastic 2) you gave an answer that encouraged a lot of self reflection rather than embracing other's opinions.\n\nYou gave the best answer but your friend wanted someone to reaffirm the  decision they'd already made.", "Nta! maybe that just wasn't the answer they were looking for (which isn't your fault) maybe talk to them and ask them if your answer upset them or made them uncomfortable?", "NTA.  I would reach out to them and let them know that you\u2019re concerned that what you said may have come across differently than intended.  Reiterate your support of and care for them, and clear the air.", "NTA. It's entirely possible the way they're acting is not directed at you. Maybe they are really torn up about the surgery and whether or not they should do it. After all, it is a big decision and can be expensive and recovery can be difficult like you said. \n\nIf you do feel like you may have upset them, you could reiterate your support for them and let them know you care about them and will support them no matter their choice.", "NTA - They asked it it would bother you. You responded that you don't care about their top surgery, it doesn't effect your friendship with them. They sound bothered  that you don't care about a decision that is the top issue in their mind. One way or the other, it doesn't matter to you.", "INFO - was there any context to the convo? Because I agree this does seem like an odd reaction. They asked you if you'd be bothered, and you responded kindly and honestly.", "Nta talk to your friend", "NTA but I would probably try to talk to them. Ask them if they are okay. If you said something wrong. Based on this, I would only think that they are maybe also a bit scared about the surgery and maybe also, even if they want it, this will sort of end a part of their life chapter and open a new one. It's a big decision. So just keep on being supportive.", "NTA. You seem to be supportive and caring towards your friend. They might have misunderstood your comment, or might have other things going on. Talk to them, and make sure they understand you are on their side.", "NTA. Go talk to them and just be an \u201cear\u201d. You could be a good friend just by being a good listener. Your friend could have interpreted \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d as \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what you do\u201d-just a misinterpretation. It happens. Go talk to them.", "NTA. Your answer would mirror what I would say if asked for my opinion. I would not have opened with I don't care, though.\n\nThe type question your friend asked often has one of these three motives: a) a simple request for your opinion, b) looking for a consensus among peers, or c) seeking for your permission.\n\nYou need to talk to your friend. Say you are sorry to have hurt them for what you said, and don't use an \"I'm sorry, but...\" form. Ask them where you went wrong. Listen to their response, it may reveal in part their motive for asking. Reassure that you love them, no matter what they choose and hope that things will go well. Going into the risks of this type of surgery is a doctor-patient conversation, leave that for the professionals. \ud83d\ude42", "NTA. If something you said upset them, they should communicate that. You aren't a mind reader!", "NTA I\u2019m struggling to find what might have been upsetting and the only think I can think of is \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d I know you meant you\u2019re supportive of any choices your friend makes.  It could come across as uncaring, when they are making a big decision.", "NTA, but maybe the way you expressed yourself was misunderstood.\n\nIt my be that your friend was looking for a different response from you - maybe some encouragement for getting the surgery, or a talk about the pros and cons of having it.  It's a big decision and it may be that your friend is struggling with it.\n\nPlease talk to your friend about this.  Reassure them that you support whatever they choose to do because you care about them.  And definitely reassure them of your friendship and support.", "NAH\n\nBut ask your friend what bothered them. \n\nI *think* it may be that by linking their top surgery with body modification and hair cuts you could have created the impression that you were diminishing the importance of the surgery. \n\nThat\u2019s wild speculation though. Just go ask your friend.", "NTA \nI am a female and I think sometimes as a cis female I struggle to get all of the struggles that could with being trans and non binary because I will never know exactly how that feels.\nI think your response if I don't care how you look I want you to be happy healthy safe and secure in your identity is a fine response \nBut they asked you a question because they care about your opinion. Using the phrase I don't care maybe not have been the wisest choice. Top surgery is a major surgery, it alters how you look and this how people look at you. It's gender affirming, yes it's for looks but it's deeper than that! Perhaps their question was deeper than what they phrased. Such as am i ready for this? I think I am femme NB, what's your opinion? Going on the journey to discover who you are is hard. Have they been rejected by friends or family in the past? Perhaps they are afraid if they take the next step you'll do the same. \nI think a simple conversation where you reiterate the fact you do care about this persons well being no matter what they identify as or how they look. And you'll support them in their decisions and you are sorry if that came across in the wrong way. Perhaps try to lighten the mood and ask them how big they want to go? Or what do they think and their reasoning behind getting top surgery and why now?\nIf anyone is NB or trans feel free to correct anything I have wrong. All love X\nGood luck op x", "NTA they maybe needed to go to their mind palace to think about what you said? That was really nice and accepting based on how I read it", "NAH. I wouldn't call you an asshole. You were...less enthused than a lot of people might hope for, but you were still explicitly supportive of your friend and it's really clear your heart was in the right place. You're a good friend and I bet they realize that. I don't even think you necessarily went wrong. I think, though, that maybe we should avoid saying things like \"you shouldn't be influenced by my opinion\". Your friend asked you for your opinion because they are trying to gauge your reaction, or because they literally want your opinion. It's not super helpful to say that kind of stuff, right? It can also feel sorta invalidating when someone says \"I don't care what you look like, or what your gender is\" which isn't really a you problem, so much as it's an idea of maybe where things didn't go as great as you'd like. To some people, the parts of their identity are important to them, and when you brush them off under \"I don't care\" it feels like you're not supporting the parts of their identity that are important to them. Again, I really don't think you did anything wrong, it's just that this stuff is all wrapped up with a LOT of feelings and insecurity. If I were you, I'd pop my head around the door and say \"hey, maybe it didn't come across earlier, but I want you to know I'll be here for you if top surgery is what you decide on. Just ask me if you need me, K?\" Sounds like you'll get through it, even if you've gotta wait for the emotional bruises to settle a bit first.", "Nta, but maybe can provide some insight. When I came out and started transitioning, it was frustrating to hear people say \"as long as you're sure/ safe!\" Cis people aren't really mandated to parse gender before they're \"allowed\" to be cis, and it's frustrating as a trans person to be talked down to like we don't know what we're doing and why.\n\nAlso, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. It's just easy to be sensitive towards these things as a trans person when you constantly have to assess (and reassess) who is safe to be around. Of course, I could also be wrong! I agree with a lot of the other comments saying you should try talking to your roommate again to reiterate your support.\n\nEdit: grammar", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like you're being super supportive, I would just be chill about it and give them time.", "NTA", "NTA - a difficult and very personal subject, and everyone is different. What you said could be right for one person and wrong for another. Talk to your friend, ask if they're upset with you and take it from there.", "NAH, but you need to talk to your friend, not us.\n\"I wouldn't care\" rarely comes off as caring to the lgbt community even when its intended to, but i think that may not be the only issue.\nSurgery is a big deal. Its scary, painful, there are serious risks involved, and it has an incredibly long recovery time. You're bedridden for days, will need help changing bandages, and can't really use your arms or lift things for a month at least.\nFor whatever its worth, when i told one of my friends i was thinking about top surgery, her immediate response was to offer to fly out and care for me while I recovered. I loved that response, because it was such a huge offer, and because it showed she knew what i was taking on and she had tangible steps to help me through it.\nThat may not necessarily be what your friend was looking for, but perhaps its an alternative perspective on how those conversations can go.", "From a trans person who is also planning on getting top surgery, NTA.\n\nI think it might be that you compared it to other body mods/haircuts because...that's really not the same thing, but I see what your intention was and what you were going for. Personally, that wouldn't bother me but I can see where it might bother someone else. The rest of your response seems pretty spot on though and a great response. \n\nThat said, talk to your friend and tell them what you said here and that you're worried you said the wrong thing, and that you were just trying to express your support and maybe add that you realize comparing it to body mods and haircuts since it might have come off as dismissive and that's not what you were trying to say. \n\nAnyway, I'm glad your friend has someone as supportive as you!", "NAH but the way you said your opinion & the opinions of others shouldn't matter has struck a nerve; telling them \"I support you in the decisions you make about your body\" isn't the same as telling them to disregard other's opinions about their body. Your friend was looking for validation & the way you gave that was a round about way that didn't get to the point they were hoping for.", "NTA based on what you said maybe your reaction was so supportive they just need time to really consider if this is what they want. Like maybe it was asked sort of out of curiosity and now they're actually considering it seriously. Like a,  damn maybe I should go for it, sort if reaction.", "It really took me by surprise, I was sitting in the kitchen and they came home from work and just sort of asked me point blank. Im trying to think if I did anything that may have come off as judgemental earlier or the day before or something but really I am stumped", "Totally agree. \"I don't care\" is one of those things that feels like we're being supportive when we say it (I don't care if you're different!) But can feel invalidating to hear from the other side. Always better to choose something like \"I support you either way\" because it says \"I do care. About YOU.\"", "This is what I was thinking, it\u2019s obviously such a larger and more permanent decision than something like a haircut but I obviously struggle to relate and didn\u2019t really know how to show my support through words. I meant to convey it in a sense of that\u2019s something that does affect how you feel and how you express yourself and I didn\u2019t want to reiterate how major of a life decision", "I guess I just think it is something that is so personal that I would have felt weird being overly enthusiastic. I am excited for them to feel comfortable in their own skin and openly express themselves. I am excited to hear about their journey. And I expressed that I\u2019d be there for that. But I obviously am not in their head and don\u2019t want to be elated for something if they haven\u2019t even decided if it\u2019s right for them or not. Just expressing excitement when they\u2019re unsure makes me feel like I\u2019m not taking the subject seriously. Does that make sense?", "Thank you for the insight. If not too personal and if you\u2019ve undergone any surgeries, what do you think was the best supportive answer or best response you got from someone was? I obviously cannot relate so can\u2019t offer any insight or advice and so I do feel like sometimes I really struggle to offer that support vocally.", "I wonder if they had a negative experience prior to talking to you. Do you think the tenseness could be from something that went down while they were out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "I got your intention. But it is open to misinterpretation. \n\nGive your friend a bit of time and then go and talk with them. Maybe write them a letter where you can be more careful with the words you use and can take the time to make it say exactly what you mean.", "Would've been a tough convo no matter what you did, I think. There's just so many feelings. It can be a weird conversation. I think you're a good friend and it's a fraught issue. You did a good job, and hopefully you and your friend get through it. Would be a shame for that kind of friendship to be lost over some misunderstood words of support. I totally see where you're coming from, though. FWIW, I've had the convo with a couple different friends now and have mostly seen success with asking people how they feel about that when they tell me. Gives them an opportunity to expound, and you the opportunity to be a good listener. I just, don't think either of you actually did anything wrong."]}
