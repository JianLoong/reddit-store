I get enough of that when I go to the shopping centre", "It just seems like commenters here are meaner now, both  to the YTA people and to the perceived assholes in the NTA posts. It makes me sad. That\u2019s all.", "Since the other thread is closed u/BiFuriousa\n\n\\> You were listened to, you just weren't acquiesced to. Listening is also a two way street, and you ignored the communication from the mod team pretty hard.  \n\n\nI didn't ignore any communication from the mod team. I was given no warning \"stop arguing or we'll lock the thread\", and I said that I would stop arguing if you unlocked my thread, that's not ignoring communication. That's being unreasonably overzealous and harsh. I hope you're proud of yourselves, and although I can't imagine how, I hope you're happy right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/Litany_of_Stoats\n\nMaybe you think that I am the problem, but there is no real reason to prohibit arguing in this subreddit, other than the mods enjoy having power over others.

Per your point in the last OF - we *do* dislike locking threads so we don't do it often, but we do it when needed.\n\nI'm sorry, I know as a mod I'm supposed to maintain some perception of professionalism despite a) this not being my profession and b) you paying absolutely fucking nothing to be here, thus not being a \"customer\" but I have to echo the reply to the last thread - *how much attention do you need?!*\n\nI just don't get it. You got *way* more comments than the vast majority of posts here and you're *this* worked up that you thread got locked. Dude. Calm down, move on.", ">What's the point in discussing a personal conflict if you can't argue and try to convince other's you're right.\n\nSooo... that would be a rule 12 problem.  You weren't looking to see if you were an arsehole (the entire purpose of posts to this sub), you were looking to prove your own righteousness.  That was clear throughout your responses, even people giving you an NTA response, if there wasn't 100% acquiesence to your point of view you went off on one.\n\n.... except... you went remarkably quiet when cornered and people made points you couldn't respond to.  Between you and the person you had a conflict with, congratulations, you both killed the night.  Neither of you sound pleasant to be around.  She's got no filter and you kick off endlessly about a one time event.  There, that's your judgement.\n\nGiven you've changed your profile pick to a poorly cropped \"AITA mods are the real assholes\" it's clear we all need to put on the soft gloves to handle you lest we cut ourselves on all your edge.\n\nThere's no shortage of places on Reddit or the rest of the internet where you can discuss and debate the differences between how men and women are treated in certain situations (which was really what you were there for.)  Heck, you can even throw in some of the responses you got \"she just wanted to fuck you bro!\" as an example if you're that fussed.  It's actually a sound example of what you want to talk about.  The post is still there to link that.\n\nAnd just to end with some kindness:  We've all gotten tilted at some point on the internet for a variety of reasons, probably more than once.  Yet when you get to the point of continuing the argument across multiple posts, changing your profile pic etc... you've gone a little too far down your own rabbit hole.  The weekend is upon us, just log off and enjoy it.  Take it from someone that's been online since the 90s, you'll be happier for it.", "Then it became twentyous.", "Oh that's just evil. PVP might be allowed in Whamageddon but you'd definitely be the asshole.", "Me paying nothing to be here? That's the way reddit works, seeing as it's the users that generate the content. If people had to pay to post here, there would be exponentially fewer posts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't like it because I was singled out (most posts with thousands of comments aren't locked), it was locked without you giving me a warning first, and you didn't reopen it when I sent a very reasonable message to you guys. \n\nI wanted to leave it open, continue the conversation.", "This year, to save him from tears, I have decided not to give my voice recording to someone special.", "Your post wasn't locked because it had 2000+ comments, it was locked because of your behavior. The rules are, in themselves, the warning.", "&#x200B;\n\n>there is no real reason to prohibit arguing in this subreddit, other than the mods enjoy having power over others.

You are fine with breaking the rules as written and whine endlessly when we dont pander to your demands to make you the exception. But at the same time you are willing to play by the rules.\n\nWhich is it? It cant be both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I wanted to leave it open, continue the conversation.\n\nIm sorry to be the one to break this to you, but what you want is irrelevant. Noone cares.\n\nYour point about 'mods enjoy having power over others' speaks of nothing but your ignorance about how moderation actually works and the fact that you are salty about your delusions of relevance falling so flat.\n\nI am curious how long you will beat this dead horse for. I suppose for some people, any attention is good attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince you clearly object to the way this sub is run, surely the obvious thing to do would be to find a sub that is governed more to your taste?\n\nI think we would survive the disappointment.", "Tears? Mate my ears would bleed. I gotta thank Siri for saving my hearing", "It's sad that the mods are too high and mighty to allow actual debates on this sub, but oh well...\n\nAnd when I said I wouldn't argue anymore, they should have unlocked it. (There's no good reason for the no arguing rule, but I would have abided by it anyway to get my post unlocked)", "12 - This Is Not A Debate Sub\n\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, **your post will be removed.**"]}
