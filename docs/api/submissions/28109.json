My father (77m) was married to Maria when he was younger and had 3 children with her. After a few years my father and his wife decided to get a divorce, it was amicable for the sake of the kids, but my father still loved his ex-wife very much. A while later, my father dated this other woman, Ana, and ended up having a son with her, Leo. Their relationship didn't last long and my father chose to wait until Leo was a bit older to introduce him to his other kids. He did so when Leo was 6, but his kids didn't take it very well.\n\nMy mother met my father a while later, they dated and she fell head over heels for him. He broke things off with her claiming to still love Maria and saying he wanted to try again with her. A few weeks later he called my mom saying he missed her and wanted to see her. I was the result. He didn't believe I was his, he wanted a DNA test and said my mother was lying. I was born and they did the test, it came back positive. Even then he never tried to approach my mother nor meet me. My mother insisted that he should give me his last name and he kept refusing to do so, so she took him to court. It was a very bloody thing, he lied several times, said she tried to baby trap him even though he was the one to approach her, lied about how much he paid for child support for his other kids, turned down visitation rights, etc.\n\nI never really missed having a dad, I have a great mother that always gave me love and affection. I asked about him and my mom was always very honest, saying that she contacted him and asked him to meet me, but he refused. I was a bit sad, but the thing that really hurt me was not knowing my siblings. I asked my mother if I could at least meet them and that's how I found out that my father had never told them about me. My mother said that he and Maria got back together and he said that Maria didn't want the kids to know.\n\nWhen I turned 18 my mom said that she had found my siblings\u2019 facebook accounts and that we could send them messages explaining the situation. I honestly don't crave a relationship with my siblings anymore, so I chose not to. I explained to my mom that I want to wait until he dies and show up in style at his funeral, preferably wearing a black dress with heels, huge sunglasses and a hat. I feel like the people that admire him should know how he really is. Also, even if he doesn't put me on his will, as one of his children, by law I have to appear at the hearing anyway.\n\nMaybe I'm an asshole for wanting to do that to people that love him and are mourning him and I sort of feel bad about that, but I feel like his name should be dragged through mud for what he did and the only way to do that would be in a place where everyone in his life is gathered and they can't manipulate the events through the grapevine of gossip.

First of all, how exactly are you going to make sure \"everyone in his life\" finds out who you are at the funeral? Are you going to interrupt proceedings and shout it to the room? That's serious asshole behavior at a funeral.\n\nBut let's say you've figured out a good way to make the announcement. Yes, you're dragging his name through the mud, but who are you hurting? Not your father - he's dead. Literally everybody else there, and most of those people are innocent bystanders.\n\nOn top of that, if you are definitely going to meet your siblings eventually, it's kinder to them to do it while they can still confront their dad, express their feelings, demand answers, whatever.", "YWBTA - you can\u2019t hurt him, he\u2019s dead. You would only hurt people who have never done anything to you and you would humiliate yourself in the process.", "YTA  \nYour beef is with *him*, not his wife and children. What good would it do to upset his surviving loved ones after he's dead? He'd never be held to account for his actions anyway, and you'd only succeed in hurting innocent people.", "Look I\u2019m not going to call you TA for not wanting to reach out to them right now (or ever), but as someone with a few more years of experience, I can promise you that revenge fantasies like that never play out the way they do in your head, and it\u2019s better to try to find peace with your life as it is than to pin your emotions on a scene that could end with you being removed from the venue by force, or have the whole situation twisted to still find a way to make you the bad guy.", "YTA. Don't punish your siblings for your fathers failings. Especially not on what will already be a difficult day for them. Like you, they're innocent of any wrongdoing in how your father chose to behave towards his children.", "YWBTA he's dead and gone, sleeping the forever sleep, the funeral is about other people coming to terms with loosing him.

No drama before he dies, no drama at the funeral.", "YTA- and not very strategic. Currently in the event of your father's death Maria has to either tell her kids or (assuming you're correct about it) break the law. She would be the one who caused them to lose their dad twice in one go. She would be the 'bad guy'. If you show up uninvited and 'all about me' you instantly become the bad guy for hurting all those people and your dad and Maria will be pretty much off the hook for hurting you, in fact everyone will assume there was a good reason to avoid you cos who does that?!?! Far better to contact Maria in the event, express your sympathies, reassure her you don't want anything from them, then remind her you'll have to be at the will reading or your absence might be used as grounds for one of the beneficiaries to dispute the split in the future. Then sit back and watch the carnage.", "YTA\n\nYou want to punish people who don't even know who you are.

Sure okay but the people that actually hurt you wouldn't be affected by your presence there. You say they have money? Obviously they'll have security at the funeral who will either remove you immediately or won't even give you access in the first place. They're also likely to just call the police and make you disappear.\n\nI love a good revenge story but this revenge is just pathetic. You want to hurt the people who isolated you? Make your existence known while your father's still alive. Have proof because they will try to get rid of you again. Having your siblings learn about you while their father lives will hurt your father, their mother, and all the other people who never wanted them to find out.

They likely wouldn't be as distressed by their father's bastards anymore.\n\nIf we're being completely honest here, you're nothing to that family and you'll probably be nothing to your siblings (except perhaps your father's first bastard child). Your dream of blowing their minds and breaking their hearts is a fantasy, the more realistic version is that you won't mean a single thing to them.\n\nIgnore your shitty father's side of your family and focus on the parent that actually cares about you because I can guarantee, whatever half-baked revenge plan you try to concoct will hurt your mother too and I don't think she deserves that.\n\nIf you're so bitter that you do want some kind of satisfaction, sue for your share of the inheritance after he dies.

Why lower yourself to that level?
