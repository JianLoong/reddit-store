{"id": 28109, "submission_id": "16yg7i2", "title": "AITA for wanting to keep my siblings in the dark until my father's funeral?", "selftext": "I (20f) have 4 siblings on my father's side. My father (77m) was married to Maria when he was younger and had 3 children with her. After a few years my father and his wife decided to get a divorce, it was amicable for the sake of the kids, but my father still loved his ex-wife very much. A while later, my father dated this other woman, Ana, and ended up having a son with her, Leo. Their relationship didn't last long and my father chose to wait until Leo was a bit older to introduce him to his other kids. He did so when Leo was 6, but his kids didn't take it very well.\n\nMy mother met my father a while later, they dated and she fell head over heels for him. He broke things off with her claiming to still love Maria and saying he wanted to try again with her. A few weeks later he called my mom saying he missed her and wanted to see her. I was the result. He didn't believe I was his, he wanted a DNA test and said my mother was lying. I was born and they did the test, it came back positive. Even then he never tried to approach my mother nor meet me. My mother insisted that he should give me his last name and he kept refusing to do so, so she took him to court. It was a very bloody thing, he lied several times, said she tried to baby trap him even though he was the one to approach her, lied about how much he paid for child support for his other kids, turned down visitation rights, etc.\n\nI never really missed having a dad, I have a great mother that always gave me love and affection. I asked about him and my mom was always very honest, saying that she contacted him and asked him to meet me, but he refused. I was a bit sad, but the thing that really hurt me was not knowing my siblings. I asked my mother if I could at least meet them and that's how I found out that my father had never told them about me. My mother said that he and Maria got back together and he said that Maria didn't want the kids to know.\n\nWhen I turned 18 my mom said that she had found my siblings\u2019 facebook accounts and that we could send them messages explaining the situation. I honestly don't crave a relationship with my siblings anymore, so I chose not to. I explained to my mom that I want to wait until he dies and show up in style at his funeral, preferably wearing a black dress with heels, huge sunglasses and a hat. I feel like the people that admire him should know how he really is. Also, even if he doesn't put me on his will, as one of his children, by law I have to appear at the hearing anyway.\n\nMaybe I'm an asshole for wanting to do that to people that love him and are mourning him and I sort of feel bad about that, but I feel like his name should be dragged through mud for what he did and the only way to do that would be in a place where everyone in his life is gathered and they can't manipulate the events through the grapevine of gossip.

First of all, how exactly are you going to make sure \"everyone in his life\" finds out who you are at the funeral? Are you going to interrupt proceedings and shout it to the room? That's serious asshole behavior at a funeral.\n\nBut let's say you've figured out a good way to make the announcement. Yes, you're dragging his name through the mud, but who are you hurting? Not your father - he's dead. Literally everybody else there, and most of those people are innocent bystanders.\n\nOn top of that, if you are definitely going to meet your siblings eventually, it's kinder to them to do it while they can still confront their dad, express their feelings, demand answers, whatever.", "YWBTA - you can\u2019t hurt him, he\u2019s dead. You would only hurt people who have never done anything to you and you would humiliate yourself in the process.", "YTA  \nYour beef is with *him*, not his wife and children. What good would it do to upset his surviving loved ones after he's dead? He'd never be held to account for his actions anyway, and you'd only succeed in hurting innocent people.", "Look I\u2019m not going to call you TA for not wanting to reach out to them right now (or ever), but as someone with a few more years of experience, I can promise you that revenge fantasies like that never play out the way they do in your head, and it\u2019s better to try to find peace with your life as it is than to pin your emotions on a scene that could end with you being removed from the venue by force, or have the whole situation twisted to still find a way to make you the bad guy.", "YTA. Don't punish your siblings for your fathers failings. Especially not on what will already be a difficult day for them. Like you, they're innocent of any wrongdoing in how your father chose to behave towards his children.", "YWBTA he's dead and gone, sleeping the forever sleep, the funeral is about other people coming to terms with loosing him. They haven't done anything to you, turning up and making a scene would just cause distress in grieving people. I'm not saying don't go but don't wait to tell them at the funeral  tell them before or after", "Yta you\u2019re only hurting your siblings doing that. If you want to punish your dad that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t do it at the expense of everyone else", "YWBTA. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t make a fuss or contact him. I don\u2019t know if he has a will, but I\u2019d show up at that meeting and make sure you get your portion of the inheritance. No drama before he dies, no drama at the funeral.", "YTA- and not very strategic. Currently in the event of your father's death Maria has to either tell her kids or (assuming you're correct about it) break the law. She would be the one who caused them to lose their dad twice in one go. She would be the 'bad guy'. If you show up uninvited and 'all about me' you instantly become the bad guy for hurting all those people and your dad and Maria will be pretty much off the hook for hurting you, in fact everyone will assume there was a good reason to avoid you cos who does that?!?! Far better to contact Maria in the event, express your sympathies, reassure her you don't want anything from them, then remind her you'll have to be at the will reading or your absence might be used as grounds for one of the beneficiaries to dispute the split in the future. Then sit back and watch the carnage.", "YTA\n\nYou want to punish people who don't even know who you are. They are completely innocent.\n\nWhat is the point of dragging someone's name through the mud after they're dead?\n\nWill it really give you satisfaction? \n\nBy law you have to appear the hearing?  What law is that?", "YWBTA. Imagine if this happened at your mother\u2019s funeral when she dies. Expose him by all means if you want to, but don\u2019t do it at his funeral.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. My gut says Maria knows about you and I respect the level of pettiness involved", "ESH\n\nWhile I sympathize with you for having a deadbeat father why, just why would you do that? \n\nAs you said you never missed having a father, while I understand wanting to expose him for the person he is how could you think that a funeral, **his funeral,** would be the right place to do it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your father was a crappy parent, but what will he care when he is dead?   \n\nOf course others can manipulate the narrative at the funeral -- \"this is the child of a vengeful crazy  ex and see how ill mannered the child is at a funeral, just like the mother, see why the he had no contact with them\" -- and then they can have security or staff toss you out.\n\nThe children have done nothing to you yet you want to punish them at the funeral for their father.

If you continue on that path you WILL learn that the hard way (especially if it really is old money), and permanently eliminate any chance of ever knowing your siblings.", "So you don't want to confront the actual villian in the story instead wait and make his funeral which is for people to grief and make it into a soap opera moment all about you a stranger in a giant hat YTA", "NTA.

Your father, his wife, the people in his family that know you, sounds like his kids suck too from what you're saying and that includes you.\n\nI'm sure your situation has made you resentful and jealous of your father's 'acknowledged' kids sp you're planning on hurting them after he dies. Sure okay but the people that actually hurt you wouldn't be affected by your presence there. You say they have money? Obviously they'll have security at the funeral who will either remove you immediately or won't even give you access in the first place. They're also likely to just call the police and make you disappear.\n\nI love a good revenge story but this revenge is just pathetic. You want to hurt the people who isolated you? Make your existence known while your father's still alive. Have proof because they will try to get rid of you again. Having your siblings learn about you while their father lives will hurt your father, their mother, and all the other people who never wanted them to find out. But idk be prepared for your own insignificance, they're adults now too. They likely wouldn't be as distressed by their father's bastards anymore.\n\nIf we're being completely honest here, you're nothing to that family and you'll probably be nothing to your siblings (except perhaps your father's first bastard child). Your dream of blowing their minds and breaking their hearts is a fantasy, the more realistic version is that you won't mean a single thing to them.\n\nIgnore your shitty father's side of your family and focus on the parent that actually cares about you because I can guarantee, whatever half-baked revenge plan you try to concoct will hurt your mother too and I don't think she deserves that.\n\nIf you're so bitter that you do want some kind of satisfaction, sue for your share of the inheritance after he dies. Wealthy children would be more pissed by that than the reveal that they have an unknown half sister...", "I can see what you are saying and I never intended to shout in the middle of it. A few people in his life know I exist, my grandparents and a few of his siblings. I want to do it more to see their faces, because they think they can use their money to keep everyone quiet about it. They are old money rich and use it as an excuse to treat their employees and others like trash. My cousin was friends with my sister and told me some stories about their family. My 3 eldest siblings also bullied Leo almost into a grave when they first met because they blamed my father's divorce on my brother, but the money kept things off the news.", "A few people in his family know I exist, my grandparents and a some of his siblings, but they used their money to keep it quiet.

They can start screaming over you the second they find out they don't like what you're saying.", "I feel like maybe contacting Leo, but the other 3 are not good people. When they first met Leo they bullied him to the point of almost killing him, but my father's family comes from old money and they managed to keep it quiet. My cousin befriended my sister without knowing and told me some really horrific stories about their family. My grandparents and a few uncles know I exist but used their money to shut every rumor down.", "I didn't have space in the post to say this part, but a few people in his family know. They come from old money, so they used it to keep it quiet.

Do children deserve the pain and confusion this would cause?\n\nYou're not thinking straight, either. Your life isn't a movie. It wouldn't be a dramatic turning of heads and a gasp, and then a fade to commercial; it would be awkward, painful, would drag on when you desperately wanted it to stop. And those people throwing money around won't feel cowed or ashamed of themselves; they'll think you're tacky and they were right to exclude you.", "That's the definition of \"making a scene\". \n\nYou're not the main character in a movie.

Personally, though, I still think you\u2019d just be sinking to their level. I doubt you\u2019ll feel good about this afterward; kind people may enjoy a revenge fantasy, but generally don\u2019t enjoy it in practice.", "Start by contacting Leo. It sounds like he has the highest likelihood of being receptive.", "If they are old money, go to one of the TV stations or scandal shows.  They love dishing out Old Money's dirty laundry.", "This is all sounding very dramatic, like something out of a TV show", "I know it does. But as someone who went to a private school with senators and ministers kids is not even the wildest story. Old money family keeping bastards in the dark is not as uncommon as it seems. And crooked cops in my country are also very common, unfortunately. The things in these circles could ruin some very powerful people", "Assuming what you say is true, why would you want to put yourself at odds with very powerful people in a country where corrupt cops are very commonplace", "Why would you want to make enemies out of those kind of people ?   \n\nAre you ready for the fallback it could have on your own life."]}
