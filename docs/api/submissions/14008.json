The issue for the restaurant is that the new restaurant is moving closer to the school and that has nothing to do with you.", "NTA. If one person is the only thing keeping the balance book of an entire restaurant in the black, then the restaurant deserved to go under.  \n\nThe worst thing you can be accused of here was being a bellwether.  It's very reasonable of you to choose to go to another restaurant, I guess if he wanted to keep the restaurant doing well, he should have been a better boyfriend.", "NTA.

While I'm sure you're terrific, you're not influential enough that the life or death of a business depends on your patronage. Your friend group can't possibly be large enough to be the difference between success and failure. Restaurants are an extremely competitive venture, and if his parents aren't up to the challenge, they're in the wrong business.", "NTA.

You did nothing wrong  and aren't out to get his parents business. Theres nothing wrong with going to another place or getting paid to hand out flyers.", "NTA. He\u2019s just trying to emotionally manipulate you, but you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.

I can completely understand how you wouldn't want to eat at a restaurant owned by your ex-boyfriend's parents. Saying that you alone have influence over what businesses in the community rise and fall seems pretty far-fetched. At the end of the day, you're in charge of where you go and how you spend your money. This other place was already willing to offer a student discount, even with the location being slightly further away. Owning your own business is difficult, but it's your responsibility as a business owner to do marketing (like handing out fliers), and offer incentives to get people to come to your business over someone else, and while they might not have the means to do so, that shouldn't be put on you. I will say, openly handing out fliers for the competition is probably pretty hurtful, I'm sure he takes that personally, and I don't think he's unreasonable for being upset. That said, if they're paying you to hand out fliers, that's a job and it just so happens to be with the competition.", "NTA. There is so much that goes into businesses. You may have dented things, but they could not hope to hide there was a less expensive place with pizza from a bunch of people with little money and a love of pizza.", "You're NTA.

What about when you graduate and move away?\n\nSome of these posts man.", "NTA - You EX sounds immature and somewhat dangerous!  If his parents restaurant can't compete, for whatever reason, they will have to close - that is the way of life for businesses.", "YTA\n\nI think given your history with their family, it's kind of petty for you to be actively marketing/handing out fliers for their direct competitor. Or at minimum, it's na\u00efve for you to think that you aren't actively harming them by doing so.\n\nI think it's perfectly fine to frequent the other restaurant and take your friends there -- but when you started accepting pay for promotion from the other restaurant, you crossed into \"enemy\" territory and I think it'd piss off most people if they were in your ex's position.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s the free market. 3) you didn\u2019t go out of your way to ruin his parents restaurant, you accepted a job to hand out fliers. Had you snuck in in the middle of the night to sabotage them, you\u2019d be an asshole but you didn\u2019t.", "NTA your ex is blaming all this on you, but you are not the one jenga block that brought all the other blocks down.", "NTA.. they gotta realize competition is every where...", "NTA.", "Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt NTA. You owe your ex and his family nothing. Also being super honest you had nothing to do with it, you are not that powerful. It is not like the pizza place moved their whole business just for 1 group and if you did not hand out the flyers they would have found another way to get publicity. It is a shame their business could not stand loosing a couple clients and a little bit of fair competition, but that is on them.", "NTA you're allowed to patronize - or not - any business you like. If this is impacting their business that much, then they need to do what businesses do and pivot. Figure out a way to get more customers. How his parents run the business is on them, not on you.", "NTA. Put your business in a popular or demographic specific area and you need to pay attention and compete. Or die.\n\nThere was a bar back near where I worked like 15 years ago. We were a big company and enough of us went there multiple times a week and especially Fridays and between all of us the tab would be a couple thousand or more, per night. One day after an unexpected death of a co worker that had nothing to do with the bar we stopped going. That bar closed down 2 months later and re-emerged as an Indian restaurant another few months later.\n\nNow I don't have any first hand info that says us stopping going there was the cause, but some on the napkin math I can see how much money they lost almost immediately. Who knows?\n\nEdit: clarifications", "They're afraid of losing more business once the pizza place moves", "The pizza place realized they could promote to students to fill the gap between lunch and dinner and must think there's enough business to make it worth moving. Great marketing move.", "Why should it matter? There's no law saying you have to patronize all your ex's family businesses, and there shouldn't be. She has no relation to that place other than she USED TO date the owners kid.\n\nThe only way that op might be remotely the asshole is if they were still dating the owners son, and even then that's tenuous if she's not actively employed by them.", "That's the free market. The only people with control of the location of a restaurants are the owners and their landlords.", "It's a free country, but the question OP seems to be posing is \"Is my ex justified in being mad at me?\"\n\nAnd the answer is clearly yes. Taking business elsewhere is totally fine -- actively marketing for a competitor is an escalation, and OP knows what they're doing and how it affects her ex's family financially and emotionally. \n\nEven if it's 100% coincidental and she has no ulterior motives other than getting paid -- she still has to own the fact that this harmful to her ex and that's a conscious decision she's made.", "NTA. His folks problems are not due to you or your friends.", "nta, there\u2019s no way they can pin their business on you. also, if you are that damn powerful, im in awe.", "Nta. But go back to the restaurant and then the pizza place. Alternate and tell your friends to do the same. It is not good to see restaurants close. Help out. You will be rewarded.", "NTA - no one person can possibly be this influential on an otherwise healthy business", "NTA. Their business failing isn't your fault. If they can't do good business, they shouldn't be in business.", "NTA", "NTA This is literally how business works.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t eat there if I were you.", "Seriously. They're either not doing a good job or OP is super powerful.", "A teenaged girl at that! \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f", "Exactly, this is ridiculous.   If a restaurant is ex girlfriend reliant there\u2019s a deeper issue at hand   NTA", "How will she be rewarded? Sounds like the only thing she\u2019ll be rewarded with is a chewing out from adults running a failing business.", "Save the cheerleader!", "Fair. But OP isn't the one moving the pizza place. Nor is the Pizza place incapable of just putting fliers on all the cars in the student parking lot. Or putting up a big banner everyone will see.\n\nUnless OP and their ex were still good friends, OP is totally above board. But based on not going to that place to eat, I'd figure they aren't that close.", "...save the world.", "If OP ever gets a job in any food serving establishment and gives customers a good experience, she'll technically be helping competitors.

Good on you for breaking up with him and getting pizza elsewhere. I commend you.", "If their business depends on on person, they should close.

I'm sure you've got lots of friends, but there is no way a single person can bring down a restaurant just by not going to it anymore. If they were that dependent on you, their business was going under anyways.\n\nYou don't control the pizza place moving closer. That's just the free market. Don't feel responsible, OP.", "NTA and your ex is being manipulative. Granted, it\u2019s probably scary for his family to possibly be losing their business, but it isn\u2019t your fault.", "NTA and your ex boyfriend is just being dramatic. As other have said a single person doesn\u2019t make or break a business if they don\u2019t eat there. But ex boyfriend DID say that is parents can\u2019t compete with the pizza place\u2019s prices. So there you have it. Either the parents reduce pricing and/or create new specials that are competitive or they change up their menu so that they can stay relevant.\n\nFrankly? They will probably be alright unless they solely depended on the teenager crowd. Most people don\u2019t want pizza EVERY single day for a meal. So as long as they (the parents) continue to offer an affordable variety they\u2019ll be fine.", "NTA. Failures love a scapegoat", "NTA unless you are Mysterio and can influence the masses.", "They\u2019re putting all their eggs onto OP\u2019s basket when it comes to business. OP doesn\u2019t have to keep coming to her ex bf\u2019s parents restaurant and quite frankly, she shouldn\u2019t if she finds it to be really awkward.", "Yeah , what happens when OP graduates and moves away ? Does the ex expect all the restaurants in the area close down ?", " \n\nIt was his fault for dating you but you never stopped going.", "NTA \n\nIf it affects their business that much, they need to do what their businesses do and pivot. Find a way to get more customers. How his parents run the business is up to them, not you.", "OP must be an influencer.\n\n/s", "NTA  the idea that you are a load bearing teenage girl is outright ridiculous.", "NTA  \n\nYou made a personal decision, because hanging around your ex's parents restaurant is weird. You found a new place to go. Your friends went with you. That the new place realizes there's money to be earned from students and is moving closer to the school is a business decision. They offered you paid work, and you accepted it.  \n\nYou are doing everything right here. Your ex being jealous is not your fault, he needs to get over it already. And if his parents' business cannot survive a little competition, well, \"That's business, baby!\"", "NTA. He is trying to guilt you and gaslight you. Their business will fail because of themselves, not you.", "Congrats.  You have managed to single-handedly bankrupt a business without even so much as saying anything negative about it.  You were the one customer holding their entire operation together and once you left, it all came crashing down.  \n\nNTA, obviously.", "I wonder what their plan was for when she graduated. Lol.", "Nah he's just lashing out to find someone to blame for his parents' restaurant closing. Cause yeah, that's a pretty bad business model and maybe parents should have told him he's not allowed to date customers or something"]}
