She told me that she wanted to have an alcohol-free Thanksgiving because she didn't want people to think they have to drink to have fun hanging out together.  She was met with some backlash from her family about this, but when she insisted that these are her rules or someone else hosts, people relented.  There were a few groans during the day about it, but it wasn't a big issue.  \n\nI'm not a big drinker, but I do enjoy a beer or cocktail like anyone else.  I usually have a pretty well stocked liquor cabinet and some beer in the fridge, but I'm definitely not drinking every day.  My GF usually just drinks wine, but she's been on a health kick lately and has decided to abstain from alcohol completely for a while.  She's been doing this for about 2 months now.\n\nShe didn't give me any grief for me drinking until last week.  I had a beer with dinner last Tuesday and she mentioned that since we aren't having alcohol at Thanksgiving, it might be good for me to try and go at least a full week without drinking.  She said that it's important to her for me to prove to myself that I can go at least that long without drinking.\n\nI asked her if she thought I have a problem with alcohol and she said no.  She said she just wants me to be healthy for the long-term because we've been talking about getting engaged.  She said it's important for my health and it shouldn't be that hard to go without it for a short period of time.  So, that's what I did.  Like I said, I'm not a big drinker so it wasn't hard at all to just not drink for a week.  \n\nBut last night I had a couple of friends over to watch a basketball game and I offered them a beer and had one myself.  I was getting us a second round when my GF got home from the gym and gave me a nasty look.\n\nAfter my friends left she called me out and said \"You really just couldn't wait to have a drink could you? You made it exactly a week and were just waiting for that first beer.\"  I asked her what her problem was and she said that maybe I do have a problem with drinking if I needed to have a beer right after the week was up.  \n\nI told her that I was just having a couple of beers with friends and I had already gone a week like she asked.  I told her that I feel like she's giving me some kind of BS test and trying to enforce her own desire to not drink on me.  I told her if she wants to test me, then she should give up Starbucks for a week and see how many days after that week is up it takes her to go get one since she's there like every other day.\n\nShe said that's different because Starbucks isn't going to kill her like alcohol can.  She said she feels like I was doing the bare minimum when I could have easily just had something else to drink while my friends were over.  I feel like something else is going on, but she says this is just about me having an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.", "created_utc": 1669927014, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9yywm/aita_for_having_a_drink_almost_immediately_after/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not sure what her deal is, whether she\u2019s projecting or jealous that you\u2019re not on a self-imposed dry period or seeing how much control she can impose on you, but that\u2019s her issue she needs to work through.

It shouldn't be used to prohibit anyone from drinking if they want to - especially with a traditional meal where a beer, a glass of wine or even a nice liquor is absolutely acceptable if not even common.\n\nI would even go so far as saying that the only time it might be acceptable to prohibit grown adults (who don't need to drive) from enjoying an alcoholic drink is in the presence of an alcoholic who just recently stopped drinking, to make it easier for them.\n\n>She said that it's important to her for me to prove to myself that I can go at least that long without drinking.\n\nHow would she even know what is important to you to prove to yourself? That's something only you can decide and this sounds extremely controlling of her.\n\n>I asked her if she thought I have a problem with alcohol and she said no.\n\n>she says this is just about me having an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.\n\nSo either you have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol or no problem - both at the same time doesn't really work.\n\n>She said that's different because Starbucks isn't going to kill her like alcohol can.\n\nUnless she's just drinking drinking black coffee, there is plenty of fats and sugar in Starbucks drinks, that can also affect ones health in the long run.\n\nAll in all, it sounds to me like she is unhappy with her decision to not drink alcohol anymore and therefore doesn't want anyone else around her not to drink either. And it's easier for her to berate you for your drinking than admitting that she made a wrong decision and thereby also admitting that she does need or at least want to have some alcohol from time to time.\n\nOr she is just a control freak getting sucked into this obsession with eating/living healthy that she wants to enforce onto everyone else as well.", "NTA.  I think someone has a problem with alcohol, but it doesn't sound like you.", "NTA\n\nIt does sound like there's something more going on though. Has she lost anyone to alcoholism?\n\n\nIf not (and if you genuinely aren't drinking a lot/binge drinking) I'd say she's overreacting and being pretty judgemental. But this is something you'll need a proper discussion on before getting engaged - you need to know what she expects from you alcohol wise and what you can expect from her in terms of this kind of behaviour.", "NTA find a new girl, sounds controlling.", "NTA, Starbucks is bad for your budget.  People give it up all the time when they go on money diets.  I think that her communication is poor.  You have tried to please her and she keeps moving the goal posts.", "NTA and your GF is being super weird about this. I'm wondering if she had a problem with drinking she didn't tell you about and isn't on some health cleanse because Starbucks isn't healthy. Caffeine can also have negative effects and is addictive. If she's having sugary drinks that's definitely not something someone on a health cleanse would drink.

She is really controlling and her attitude sucks.  Good luck with her.", "NTA-  overdoing sugar is absolutely bad for you in the long run. The burnt coffee taste is balanced by sugar.  Getting a better coffee with a spoonful of sugar practically has the same taste. \n\nThe starbucks- drinking equivalent is totally on the same level.  \n\nModeration is the key to everything.

It should be your choice to drink as an adult if you're not doing it in an unhealthy way. If your drinking is actually closer to the excessive category, she might have a point.

OP's fianc\u00e9e has explicitly stated that she does not think he has a problem with alcohol.
