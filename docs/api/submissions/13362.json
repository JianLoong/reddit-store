Before we were married, my wife had a daughter Izzy, who unfortunately died when she was really young. We have one son together, Richie(9M).\n\nLosing Izzy hit my wife really hard, and even today, she's still not completely recovered from it. To honor her, she volunteers at our local children's hospital. She already works a busy job, but still finds the time to volunteer, as she is very dedicated. She also donates to the hospital as well.\n\nThe problem is that she is very holier than thou, and keeps shaming me for not wanting to volunteer. I mean, I feel like she should be able to choose to volunteer with this organization if it's meaningful to her, but I just find it weird and annoying how incessantly she constantly bugs me to volunteer, and shames me, making me out to be an unkind person. She doesn't do it outright, but it's very passive aggressive.\n\nAs richie's gotten older, she's been telling him about why it is important for us to volunteer, and how he can honor his older sister. She's talking a lot about giving back to your community, and how good people always find time. It is nice, but I just feel like she's pressuring our son, and kind of like forcing him to do it in a guilt-trippy way, and I also don't think he's old enough to hear about Izzy. It's just a really sad and awful thing that he's not emotionally ready for.\n\nThe hospital is holding a toy drive, so my wife, without telling Richie, gave his old hot wheels he had when he was a toddler to the hospital. When he found out, he was understandably distraught, but my wife told him that he was too old for those silly toys, and that younger kids needed them more.\n\nWhen I found out I was absolutely fuming. I tried to talk some sense into her, but she wouldn't listen, so the next day I took Izzy's old teddy bear and donated it. When my wife found out, she was absolutely ballistic, but I remained calm and told her I did it because I feel like you need to let go, and that you are holding your deceased daughter over our son, and you're not there for us. I explained that you need to properly deal with this grief, and that you're acting very unhealthy, but she just went really quiet and stopped listening to me, and now it's like I'm not even there. She's been ignoring me since, and I tried to explain or reconcile, but she's not listening to me, and I don't know what to do\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1679972137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124adei/aita_for_donating_my_wifes_late_daughters_teddy/", "score": 871, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know you can buy more hot wheels, right? You know what your wife can't buy? More mementos of her dead daughter. YTA.", "YTA\n\nI would divorce your cruel, spiteful ass. How DARE you donate a toy that she kept from her dead daughter??", "I\u2019m pretty sure the reason why she\u2019s not talking to you is because she\u2019s getting her bearings together to file for a divorce.  \n\nOh and btw, YTA", "GO GET THAT BEAR.", "Dude. \n\nHer daughter is fucking dead. She'll never be able to buy her child any more toys. You got rid of an important tangible object that was helping your wife feel connected to her deceased daughter over some hotwheels you could easily replace for your LIVING son. \n\nHow sickening. YTA", "YTA.\n\nYour wife's donating of your son's toy was an asshole move. However, what you did is a goddamn atrocity, making your wife not an asshole since you have pretty much re-defined scale of assholery with your act.\n\nIf you wanted to teach your wife a lesson, appropriate action would be to give away one of your wife's thing such as earphones, etc.", "YTA. Your wife should not have donated the hot wheels without talking to your son first. It sounds like he was no longer playing with those hot wheels by the way you worded it, but she still should have asked. That is a night and day difference from a teddy bear belonging to her dead child. Grief is a complicated and messy thing, even more so when dealing with the loss of a young child. I hope you never have to experience it.\n\nLosing that teddy bear was probably like losing one of the last links to her daughter and may have felt like Izzy dying all over again. You need to contact the toy drive and tell them that the bear got mixed up with the toys, see if they can find it and she can get it back. \n\nTo the rest of your post: she should not be pressuring you to volunteer, but it sounds like she wants to make sure that her daughter is remembered. Hopefully she is getting some therapy, but her grief will never just go away, she will never just get over it. instead, she will learn how to live her life around it.\n\nI have worked with a lot of families who have lost young children. Their subsequent children know about the sibling who died, this is common. Your son is capable of learning that he has an older sister who is no longer here. There are age appropriate ways to present that. I hope your wife, and you as well, are gettin needed therapy. Most of all, your wife needs of know that Izzy is still alive in her memory, and in yours. Izzy being dead does not mean that she is no longer part of the family, and it sounds like maybe ya ur wife feels like Izzy is being intentionally forgotten. Hopefully you can all find a path forward that honors Izzy\u2019s memory without making you feel like your wife is guilting you.", "YTA x 100\n\nAs someone who has lost a child, if I was your wife, I\u2019d be filing divorce paperwork ASAP.

It\u2019s not the same thing. To try and make it about her acting \u201cunhealthy\u201d on top of it is so wrong. If you felt she needed help, causing her emotional distress and throwing away memories of her daughter was certainly not the way to go. You shouldn\u2019t expect her to forget or stop talking about her daughter that\u2019s not something anyone just gets over.  \n\nFrom what you write, I don\u2019t think she is shaming or pressuring you to volunteer. It sounds like volunteering and giving back is important to her so she wants to instill that in your son. Modeling behavior is important for kids maybe she\u2019d appreciate not being the only one.

Seriously. Be a broken record if you have to. All this guilt is not helping her.

Before we were married, my wife had a daughter Izzy, who unfortunately died when she was really young. We have one son together, Richie(9M).\n\nLosing Izzy hit my wife really hard, and even today, she's still not completely recovered from it. To honor her, she volunteers at our local children's hospital. She already works a busy job, but still finds the time to volunteer, as she is very dedicated. She also donates to the hospital as well.\n\nThe problem is that she is very holier than thou, and keeps shaming me for not wanting to volunteer. I mean, I feel like she should be able to choose to volunteer with this organization if it's meaningful to her, but I just find it weird and annoying how incessantly she constantly bugs me to volunteer, and shames me, making me out to be an unkind person. She doesn't do it outright, but it's very passive aggressive.\n\nAs richie's gotten older, she's been telling him about why it is important for us to volunteer, and how he can honor his older sister. She's talking a lot about giving back to your community, and how good people always find time. It is nice, but I just feel like she's pressuring our son, and kind of like forcing him to do it in a guilt-trippy way, and I also don't think he's old enough to hear about Izzy. It's just a really sad and awful thing that he's not emotionally ready for.\n\nThe hospital is holding a stuffed toy drive, so my wife, without telling Richie, gave his old hot wheels he had when he was a toddler to the hospital. When he found out, he was understandably distraught, but my wife told him that he was too old for those silly toys, and that younger kids needed them more.\n\nWhen I found out I was absolutely fuming. I tried to talk some sense into her, but she wouldn't listen, so the next day I took Izzy's old teddy bear and donated it. When my wife found out, she was absolutely ballistic, but I remained calm and told her I did it because I feel like you need to let go, and that you are holding your deceased daughter over our son, and you're not there for us. I explained that you need to properly deal with this grief, and that you're acting very unhealthy, but she just went really quiet and stopped listening to me, and now it's like I'm not even there. She's been ignoring me since, and I tried to explain or reconcile, but she's not listening to me, and I don't know what to do\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She\u2019ll never see her go on her first date, act in a school play, or graduate. All she has, and all she ever will have, are *things* to remind her of times with Izzy that now live only in her memories. Well, unless you donated the only thing left.

You don\u2019t seem to understand but you giving away that Bear is the equivalent of taking her daughter away from her again. It was a physical link to her child and you destroyed that and just expect her to get over it like it was no big deal.

Eventually. Right now she needs a trusted person to check in with her to make sure she isn\u2019t suicidal over this. I\u2019m not kidding or exaggerating. Don\u2019t try to do it yourself. You\u2019re not capable. Maybe her mom (Izzy\u2019s grandma) or a sister?

But maybe she just wants to share quality time with you where you will feel closer to her daughter? People process loss very differently and she is so aggressively attached to her that she is desperately trying to not let go of her memory. That is probably where the \"holier than thou\" attitude comes from, because you are trying to get her to *forget* about her dead child. Do you know how she died? Have you offered to do *anything* in her memory? Death anniversary special tradition?\n\nNo, OP. You do not get over a *DEAD CHILD* by getting rid of the most precious item a grieving mother has left of them.\n\nAlso, there is absolutely nothing wrong with telling Richie about his dead older sister. Your wife only wants to involve him in her life so *he* knows about her.\n\nIf this marriage survives, it would be by the skin of your teeth, but I think there is no coming back from this.\n\nI really, *really* hope you don't go through what she did.", "If You\u2019ve never lost a child (neither have I, thankfully) you can\u2019t understand what that\u2019s like.

Your note drips with contempt and spite. She deserves better than this. What a cruel way to punish her for throwing out your boy\u2019s cars. Over the top and unwarranted. Honestly, you should be ashamed.", "You should really think about what you mean when you say \u201crecover\u201d. Because when a parent loses a child, that isn\u2019t something you can just get over.

I want to go find the teddy bear.\n\nParents who lose children have every ounce of my respect and I cannot begin to pretend I understand their pain.", "Thank you", "Where does it say that? Never heard this before.", "Absolutely this - he knows what he did was cruel. His wife had lost her daughter before they got married, and presumably before OP had met her, so he would have known about her loss before they got married and had a child, but he thought she would just... get over it. She's not and he's punishing her for it.", "There are definitely age appropriate ways to explain it. I was three when I first learned about death.\n\nUnfortunately sometimes you have to explain but there's certainly a right way and a wrong way to do it.", "It's not too young per say. Depends on the child and thier emotional intelligence.  My husband works at a children's hospital and you would be amazed at thier understanding. My child when asked if she has siblings says yes, but they are in heaven.  (Which I did not push on her being that I am an athiest). She understood that her momma had three pregnancy losses before her,  (she was a shockingly healthy pregnancy and also unplanned) and did not want to chance more losses. Mentally I do not think I could handle anymore losses. I think I would flip my shit if my husband went into my closet and got rid of the few momentos I have. I imagine the grief would be much harder with a child you saw growing up held. I know families that kids died and they volunteered at the hospital often for the sense of kinship with people who have gone through it too, and to help those actively going through terminal illnesses with children.", "I'm surprised he didn't rip up all the pictures and everything she had of her child like all other terrible steps do when they're jealous of a deceased person.", "Yeah definitely he's trying to make her sound worse to justify his nasty revenge. IMO no matter how much of an AH someone is, if you actively go out to get revenge, you are at least a little bit an AH too. \n\nAlso it's really sad because I'm sure the kid probably would have been OK with donating his old toys if she asked first, and even if he wasn't initially, generally kids come around quickly enough when they realise a week later they haven't actually played with that toy since.", "\"Clearly\"? because she volunteers and preaches the value of volunteering? Who made this guy the center of her universe and why should everything revolve around him? He's a grown up and they have a big boy together. Kid should be taught moral bearing at his age anyway, and it seems to me like she's doing a good job.\n\nEverything holds \\*some\\* sentimental value. But something belonging to someone who's not with us any longer gets bonus points; damn, I'm 41 and can't bring myself to repurpose or throw the food bowl of my late cat but in the meanwhile I laugh if I break 10 plates received at my wedding.

OP, YTA.", "You sure don't understand the process of grief. It's like a rollercoaster, and different people handle it differently.

It calls for immediate divorce though I wouldn't think I would be so naive to marry a person like you.\n\nYTA. A very insensitive AH at that.", "YTA (happy cake day)", "Yeah, OP would fully \"recover\" from his son's death, seems like grief is a vague and irrelevant concept to him. Like love.", "OP wants to pretend her daughter never existed. That's what's dangerously unhealthy here. She died before her time, but will always be a part of her mom's life, and having a reminder of her is normal.

They are always MY babies.", "I've heard a story about my great-grandmother...\n\nIn the 1910s, they lived in a house with a wood stove. One winter morning, she was boiling water on the stove to start the day.  What she didn't realize was that one of her sons crawled behind the stove to get warm.   Something startled her as she was taking the water off the stove.  It fell on her son and scalded him.  He ended up dying.\n\nMy mother would tell a story about her grandmother from probably the 1950s or 60s.  The cows Mom's father had would come to the barn to be milked.  But her grandmother's cow had a bell.  When it was time to milk the cow, her grandmother would take a stool and a pail and go look for the cow.  Sometimes, it would take a while for her to come back.\n\nLater, Mom always wondered if her grandmother would go to her son's grave when she was \"looking for the cow.\"\n\nThat was the only child my great grandmother lost before adulthood.  I'm not sure anyone alive today knows where he was buried.  We didn't even know his name until my great aunt died and listed the brothers who predeceased her.\n\nThis all happened in the first half of the Twentieth Century, in rural Virginia.  Momentos and sentimentality wasn't really a 'thing.'  But I don't think my great grandmother ever forgot him.  She went on because there was no other choice. \n\nThere are words for children who lose parents (orphans) and someone who loses a spouse (widow/widower), but there's no word for a parent who loses a child.  That's a pain that can't be conveyed in one word.", "Exactly! If you're lucky, a sharp pain eventually becomes a dull ache.\n\nBut he just reset her grieving process.", "Can you believe that he has a child and cannot fathom her grief?  Thats alarming.", "Obviously just 24 hours because he clearly only loves himself.", "Wife should have discussed the hot wheels toy donation with the son beforehand, but that typical parental \"I'm getting rid of your old toys you don't use anymore\" mild AH bit absolutely pales in comparison to OP.", "100% this.", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf! And it's worse because it is her CHILD. It's not the fact that it's been 12 years, it's the fact that it has ONLY been 12 years.\n\nMy brother died at 21. He quarreled with my dad before he died. I truly believe the guilt destroyed him, and he died 4 years later.\n\nMy mom is still alive, but she's never been the same. Her health has also declined since that day.  It's been 30 years and it still plays in my head like a movie.\n\nYTA", "Yes, one of my best friend\u2019s older brother died when he was a baby, not even a year old. My best friend wasn\u2019t born yet. There are still pictures of him in the home. He had a name and they celebrate his birthday still too.

Thank you!", "And try for a new baby to replace him.", "I think it would be the opposite. He would be constantly keeping score and accusing his wife of grieving more for Izzy.
