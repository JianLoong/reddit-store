Imagine you're not in a civilized nation. Imagine that instead of a functioning government with laws and police, you live in a nation where the primary source of order is a violent gang of thieves, extortionists, and slavers. They will use any excuse at all to violently beat, rob, enslave, or kill you and anyone else who displeases them in any way. They do this with complete impunity.\n\nNow if somebody's making trouble, you can call the gang and they'll come and deal with the situation. But  chances are good the response will be ***wildly*** disproportionate.\n\nSo when you call them, it needs to be BAD. It needs to be a situation where that kind of response is merited. Where it's ok that the responder is a sociopathic bully because that's what you need right now.\n\nThat's America, if you're not rich and/or white. The prison system is [literal slavery](https://www.aclu.org/news/human-rights/captive-labor-exploitation-of-incarcerated-workers), and the police are slave-takers. They can also steal your money, your property, whatever they want, [essentially at will](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/asset-forfeiture-abuse). They can and do kill certain sorts of people with [near absolute impunity](https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/ending-qualified-immunity-once-and-for-all-is-the-next-step-in-holding-police-accountable), and lesser forms of violence are shockingly commonplace. Even when caught on camera they [almost invariably get away with it](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/20/us/police-convicted-murder-rare-chauvin/index.html).\n\nSo when you call the cops on someone, you're not calling a true law enforcement organization. You're calling a gang of organized slavers.\n\nIf the crime is not at the level where actual years of slavery is a fair punishment, then YTA if you call the cops. You are morally equivalent to the collaborators who sent escaped slaves back to the south before the civil war.\n\nBy the way: the response I always hear is \"but what are we supposed to do then\"? Guess what: it SUCKS living in a country where you can't trust law enforcement to react in a sane way. There are a ton of situations where you're just screwed if you can't trust the cops.

She said that she didn't want to go through insurance, and her son could arrange the repairs on my vehicle. I said that it was fine if they didn't want to go through insurance, they could deal with my insurance company directly.\n\nHer son texted, and offered to arrange the repair on my vehicle, I said no, I wanted to settle this through insurance, and he could talk to my insurance company. He said that he didn't believe in insurance, because it was a scam, and I'd be stupid to put in a claim when he knew a professional repairer who could fix the car, and I should thank him for doing me this courtesy. I thanked him and said that the insurance company was also capable of arranging a professional repairer. He went off, calling me a scam artist and an abuser of the elderly, and I had no proof that the accident even happened. I pointed out that I now had multiple text messages from his mother and himself, admitting liability and offering to pay for the damage.\n\nI submitted the claim, and surprise, surprise, the other car wasn't registered therefore it was not roadworthy, didn't have compulsory third party and the driver was breaking the law by having it on the road. It cost about $50 to buff out the little dent in my car. So I can see why they were keen to deal with me directly.", "Absolutely.
