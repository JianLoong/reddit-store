Instead, if they honor the original promise, I would drop the charges. The woman has more-than-likely experienced a reality-check inducing scare from this, and if you get the appropriate replacement, it would be worth considering letting bygones be bygones.\n\nMaybe I'm just too compassionate, but regardless of the cost, a fishing rod shouldn't be worth the potential ramifications this woman will face.

Offering to pay you back was too little too late. She already spoiled your day with her abusive entitled attitude and money for a new fishing rod doesn't account for the inconvenience of replacing it in the middle of a fishing trip.
