Both daughters are saying they need new phones because they\u2019ve had theirs for a couple years now and they are just not functioning correctly anymore (not holding a charge, glitchy, etc). Husband and I have been looking into options, we\u2019ve recently moved and don\u2019t have much money to work with. One option we found is to drop our current 4 line plan down to 2 lines, and then we found a deal to get 2 new iPhone 15\u2019s with another company and use their service for two lines. So basically we\u2019d have two lines with one company, two with another, and we\u2019d also have to pay an extra $24 per month for each of the iPhone 15\u2019s.\n\nWe told them if we do this option, we would have their phone numbers changed to the iphone 11\u2019s that he and I bought 5 months ago. Still in perfect condition. He and I would get the two new iPhone 15\u2019s. \n\nThey were annoyed that they don\u2019t get the 15\u2019s, because he and I don\u2019t NEED new phones like they do. We say that the 11\u2019s are an upgrade from what they have and are still new phones because they are only a few months old. When one of the girls asked why it is this way instead of them getting them, I replied with \u201cWell because we are the ones who pay the bill\u201d. Pretty straight forward. \n\nWe just relocated across the country and both of them are trying to get jobs (the 19 year old more so), so I did also comment that \u201cWhen you get a job you\u2019re welcome to pay for your own iPhone 15\u201d.\n\nSo, are my husband and I the assholes for keeping the newer phones for ourselves in this (still hypothetical) situation? Should we give in and keep the ones that we currently have (which have been perfectly fine for us) and give our daughters the new ones?", "created_utc": 1696686074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1726nx6/aita_for_not_buying_my_daughters_new_phones/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your children aren't entitled to things just because they think you should buy them. If they had offered to trade places with you, and let you have an iPhone 15 and they would take the 11's, that could change things. But just wanting the newest iPhone just because? It's not necessary for their health and safety. If they don't like them they can feel free to get jobs and buy their own.", "NTA\n\nYou found a very reasonable compromise, and they still aren\u2019t happy. Your daughters are more concerned with the latest and greatest than getting the brand new phones you just received. \n\nLet them find jobs so they can afford the expensive new phones.", " NTA. Your kids are both old enough to work and buy their own phones. The 19 y/o can even get her own phone contract.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re not even obligated to buy them phones in the first place, especially the 19 year old. You\u2019d be well within your rights to tell them to get a job and pay for it if you wanted. \n\nTheir entitlement is what should concern you. Frankly, that alone would have be hesitating to buy them new phones at all.", "NTA- You are paying for the new contracts, you get the phones that come with it. They should be grateful to have a new phone period. They should feel fortunate that they aren't getting those old style Nokia phones. I mean they lasted forever.", "Thank you all for your replies!\n\nA few things to note.\n\n1) my kids are great kids, honestly. Of course any teenager would prefer the newer phone and they were in their right to express that. They were annoyed, but they didn\u2019t go stomping off, no yelling, nothing like that. Yes there are some entitlement issues, we have sat them down and talked to them about it before\u2026but generally they are sweet, well behaved and respectful kids. My question was more about if I\u2019M the asshole, not them because I know their response is natural. Also, I don\u2019t think their response is a reflection of how I\u2019ve raised them, they are good people and while they were growing up I always got compliments on how polite and well behaved they were.\n\n2) we just moved from California to Florida, we know nobody at all. While yes I could shut off their lines and tell them to figure it out, I won\u2019t do that. I drove them across the country away from everyone they\u2019ve ever known, I\u2019m not going to take away their contact to those people no matter what.\n\n3) yes my 19 year old lives with us. She chose to come with us when we moved, even though she didn\u2019t live with us anymore back home. She is looking for a job and once she gets one she will start paying for her own phone line, contributing a bit to household needs, and saving for her own car and apartment. It is unfortunate that it has already taken a month to get a job, but she is trying. The 16 year old goes to school and has a few school related activities that she does throughout the week after school, so although she wants to get a job and is actively looking, it would have to be very limited hours.\n\n\nAgain, I appreciate you all taking the time to reply to me. We are still looking at options, I think I just wanted to post this because part of me is feeling guilty. We\u2019ve always tried to teach our kids about hard work and make sure they know that they have to work for everything in life and be grateful for what they get.", "NTA. Nice try kids!", "From where I see is that both you and your husband is happy with your current phones, now you have a chance to get brand new one for the kids, then why don\u2019t you give them the brand new ones instead of your current ones?\u263a\ufe0f\n\nThat would make them super happy, and that would make a difference in their lives, while in yours it wouldn\u2019t matter because you are happy with your iPhone 11 anyways\u263a\ufe0f\n\nIt\u2019s just a chance/opportunity to make the kids happy while they are still kids, so why not?\u263a\ufe0f", "NTA. But/and\u2026 the IPhone 11\u2019s are going to be glitchy and not great sooner than you expect. I recently got a new phone and they weren\u2019t even offering 11\u2019s anymore. Ended up with a 14, since the guy warned that even the 13\u2019s will be problematic within the next couple mandatory software updates.\n\nThat DOESNT mean you should get the girls new phones. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to give them the 11\u2019s and tell them now that these are the last phones you are buying and they need to plan accordingly. Either they save the $ to buy new phones or have a job and payment plan lined up with you when they upgrade. \n\nIf they really want to push it, the 19 year old can feel free to go get whatever phone she wants\u2026 on HER OWN plan.", "NTA. No one \"needs\" a new phone unless it's not longer working. They're welcome to get jobs so they can pay for new phones themselves and you can keep paying for the plan.", "NTA, let them know you could have just gotten them flip phones", "NTA. They think they are entitled to something they aren\u2019t. The 19 can buy her own phone if she wants the latest one.", "Hi always make sure my kids never had better phones that I did if I was paying for everything.  They\u2019re old enough to help contribute financially.", "NTA. This is interesting to me. Back in the day a when phone was considered a luxury and not something that everyone just has like today, I really wanted a Blackberry and my mom told me to get a job. She didn't say I couldn't have it, but she was a single mom with a mortgage, property taxes, bills, and of course she had me to take care of. There were things more important than an expensive phone. Did I want dinner on the table or a cell phone?She also wanted to teach me about working hard and earning it. Both your daughters are old enough to have some kind of job where they can save up to buy the phones they really want. They're old enough to learn that they can't just be handed everything they want on a silver platter.", "NTA. very reasonable to give them your current ones and yall get the new ones. Once they start working, they can save for their own new phones if they choose.", "NTA, tell 16 year old to persevere until she gets a job and can find a new phone. Tell 19 year old she\u2019s an adult and to buy her own damn phone.\n\nHow entitled are these two kids", "NTA who pays the bills? Oh yeah the adults so you get dibs on the phone models available", "NTA, but if you\u2019re interested in options, have you ever checked out backmarket ? Note that I said BACK market, not the black market. They\u2019re a company dedicated to repairing, recycling, and reselling tech to keep it out of landfills. My past couple of gadgets have been from BM and we\u2019re all great, and when I did get one that started malfunctioning right away BM was awesome about replacing it. That might be a good option for you if your budget is tight.", "NTA, if your children were younger then this kind of behavior would be understable at some point but these are teenagers pushing early adulthood, if they aren\u2019t willing to pay for their bill, then they shouldn\u2019t have a problem w them getting an older version. Besides your 19 year old is old enough to get her own contract and not be begging her parents for the newest phone. sounds like your children think they\u2019re entitled to this.", "Great example of choosing beggars. \n\nGood opportunity to teach gratitude,  and also negotiation skills. \n\nNTA", "NTA. They\u2019re just being 16 and 19 year-olds.", "When you pay for the phone you get to decide who gets the new one. The newest version is not a need. My 16 and 19 year olds both bought their own phones when they wanted to upgrade.", "My kids have been saving for their own phones for years now.  They like iPhones,  our budget is more basic.  Honestly,  both your kids are at the age where they can work.  If you're feeling generous, tell them you'll go halfers on a new phone, you pay half, they pay half?  I think it's important for kids to understand that these little luxuries in life come with a cost.", "NTA,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMan, I wish I had parent who'd give me a Iphone lol I had to work for my shit.\n\nI think that your compromise is more then fair.", "NTA. \n\nAnd with time and maturity (and continued good parenting), it\u2019ll be a funny tidbit in the future. \n\nAt their age, it can seem like the end of the world not to have the latest stuff.", "NTA, my parents gave me their old phones when they upgraded, it was like a phone cycle lol. When I turned 19 and had a decent job I was able to buy my own brand new phone", "nta\n\nthe iphone 11 is a perfectly good phone, been using mine since 2020 and the only minor problem is the older battery", "My kids would have no phone if they threw a fuss.", "NTA if they don't want those let them work and buy their own phones. Working won't kill anyone.", "Oh hey. They're the kids, you're the parents paying. They either take what's offered or stick with what they already have\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nJust because they WANT the newest and shinier doesn't Mean they can't deal with the slightly used, not brand spanking newest and bestest.\n\nNTA", "You're right. Both are old enough to work and contribute the phone costs. They're going to have to pay for their own lines one day.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve only just upgraded from an IPhone 5. An IPhone 11 is pretty good.", "Kijiji and Facebook marketplace sometimes have good deals on used phones but, of course, there's always a risk of being ripped off.", "Go buy them Xiaomi. They're cheap while having similar specs and still work really great. \nNTA", "Nta. When my kid needs a new phone, I upgrade and they get my old one. They know if they want the brand new one, they have to pay for it.", "NTA my 16 yo had an 8! And he is very appreciative of it", "NTA. Be clear that their options are the iPhone 11s or their current ones.", "Nta. Hand me downs are a right of passage", "NTA\n\nI am an adult who can well afford a new iPhone every year if I were that stupid.\n\nI am currently using an iPhoneX which is perfectly fine. The battery is getting a bit weak in terms of charging but that would be easily remedied with a relatively inexpensive battery change. Plus there are inexpensive chargers available for people who use their phone so much during the day without access to electricity that they might need a boost.\n\nI am currently upgrading to the 15 because the iPhone X can't be upgraded to the new iOS. The iPhone 11 can.\n\nPlus - and this is not a humble brag - I can afford to do this easily. When my finances didn't allow me to indulge a bit I used a flip phone for six years until 2011.\n\nYou are the adult - they are of an age when they can work and purchase whatever upscale phone they want. FWIW, there are relatively inexpensive refurbished iPhones that they can buy down the road with their own money.\n\nETA - I am keeping my iPhone X because it can be used as a Wifi device. I have Apps that control various smart functions in my home and so it will be convenient to have in my night stand. The only thing a Wifi iPhone can't do is make cell calls and who makes phone calls anyway. And of course if out of the home and away from a Wifi network, you can't text or use the browser or other internet stuff.", "Nta when my foster mom upgraded her phones the other phones got passed down I went from Samsung, to Blackberry well she went Blackberry to Iphone", "NTA next time your kids ask say sure if you pay for it. It\u2019s time they transition to taking over their own finances and purchases of non needed items.", "I feel so sorry for people that have parented themselves into this position. Oh wait NO I DONT \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 like can you try harder before they become society's issue in a few short years?!\n\nYta. Like not the asshole to your kids but to yourselves lmao", "Nope! NTA! If they don't like the FREE phones that they are given AND the cell service that they are NOT paying for, they can just keep what they have. \nThis might be a valuable lesson in the proverb, \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. \"", "NTA \n\nThis is pretty much how it\u2019s been in my family, the older ones get the new stuff while the younger ones get hand me downs (and of course their own new stuff at special occasions). \n\nI grew up before the cellphone age, it came while I was a teen. So my brother got one first when he was old enough. A couple years later he got a newer one and I got his first phone\n\nFast forward to now and my daughter. She got her own newish phone(not the latest model by far but not old either, iPhone 8)and it works great. \n\nMy mom survived with an old Nokia for ages and my dad  got the iPhone 5s, then my moms phone died and they bought a new phone for my dad (another 5s) my mom got his first iPhone 5s and just a few years ago(right after my daughter got hers) my moms phone literally split in the seams,the entire screen had come undone and was barely hanging on. Still works though\u2026 so they decided to get some newer phones because it was time really(they were very limited by now). They found a deal and got 2 iPhone SE, \n\nOf course my daughter then complains that her phone is \u201cold\u201d because she now has the oldest model of them all\u2026 she got the same answer, pay for it and you can buy it, until then it\u2019s either a special gift(b-day/holiday) or a hand me down if possible", "NTA. As soon as I started making an income while still living at home, my mom stopped paying for my phones and my phone bills. Which is completely fair, btw. If I wanted a new phone and I couldn't pay in cash, I got it on a payment plan without added interests (it's a thing where I live) or I waited until I had the money to buy it out right away. Bear in mind that I didn't get my first smart phone until I was like 23. Before that I had older phones that my mom got me when I was younger because they still worked and I didn't really need anything fancier back then. When I was a teen, no one had smart phones luckily. But your daughters are old enough to either pay for their own phones or take what you give them if they can't.\n\nI bought my iPhone 5 and both of my iPhone SE's myself. Then my mom got a new iPhone but her iPhone 8 still held up very well so I bought that one from her at a reasonable price. Now I have my iPhone 13 mini, which I bought on a payment plan, so that's like 5 phones in 10 years, Idk if that's a lot really.", "Nta\n\nYour responsibility as parents is to provide for your kids to the best of your ability. I would say providing your kid a working phone is a basic need in 2023. That doesn\u2019t mean the newest phone. You all simply can\u2019t afford new phones for the whole family, so this is the most reasonable solution", "NTA - Make them work it off. Old enough to get jobs. I had an iPhone 7 up to this past February and I had no problems. Unless they\u2019ve had the phones for over 5 years or having been charging them correctly these are just excuses to get new phones. If they aren\u2019t working properly factory reset them.", "NTA, gave the kids good options, stick to it", "Not at all. Me and my 16 yo daughter were due for new phones. We did have an upgrade deal but any money that had to be paid towards the new phone was her responsibility. She decided she didn\u2019t need the 15 and paid for an older version. If she has a working phone, I\u2019m not paying to replace it.", "If your daughters don't want the iPhone 11, you can give it to me and I can give them my iPhone 8. :-)", "NTA.\n\nI think you dealt with the situation perfectly. At 18 my mum took me off her contract and I was responsible for my contract and phone. I feel the oldest is very fortunate to be on the plan with you and your husband. So you are NTA.\n\nThis also gives them more of an incentive to begin working and when they achieve their goals i.e. either saving to buy the 'latest' phone or to start their own contract. I suspect they will have a big sense of achievement and pride. I do suspect it may be a while before this subject is dropped and may be bought up at any occasion they can \ud83d\ude2c", "Im not sure of american prices but a good recommendation I could make is looking for a samsung galaxy a54. Iphones are great but they have one major flaw: the phones are mainly high end and expensive (with the exception of the iphone se). Many other brands tailor for different prices and the a54 is a great pick for a mid range phone that doesnt break the bank like an iphone. Both are great brands but when comparing devices on a lower budget samsung would be a better choice.", "Well, I\u2019d give them to the kids. They need them, you don\u2019t (from what I understood). Unless you really want the new ones, why take them away from them?", "NTA for the reason you mentioned.\n\nBut better get them a refurbished 11 as well.", "NTA. I have an iPhone 8 and it still functions properly lol", "I sincerely hope you posted this to prove to your daughters how entitled they are being and not because you are honestly questioning whether you and your husband should give your children new phones over the 2 adults who pay for the phones. My daughter would have a choice between a flip phone and no phone if she came to me with that attitude. \n\nNTA. Children are not royalty that deserve every whim imagined catered to. They are people who have to function in this world, learning how to earn things they want and need. There are times when it is expected for parents to go without for the children, but that applies to necessity. Iphones are a luxury that parents are not demanded to provide. \n\nYou have a job and can afford an iPhone 15. So you get to have an iPhone 15. Your kids don't work and can't afford an iPhone 15. Life sometimes is this simple.", "NTA. They want something different they can pay for it.", "NTA. The solution is perfectly acceptable. If they want newer phones they can trade in their models and pay the difference out of pocket. \n\nThey don\u2019t HAVE to be on your plan, they don\u2019t HAVE to accept the circumstances. It\u2019s what happening. Take it or leave it. \n\nI have so many people on my plan bc it\u2019s so inexpensive for unlimited due to military plan. My son is irritated that we wouldnt allow him time get the latest and greatest with the payment plan. \n\nWe purchase our phones outright and activate them with the carrier. If we don\u2019t have the money, we don\u2019t need it. It\u2019s not a need it\u2019s a want. It\u2019s nice to want things. \n\nHe has the option to get his own phone plan.

Just answer: option 1 or 2?", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nBuying them phones as nice as an iPhone is already a privilege. They are plenty old enough to find a job and pay for their own phone.

Of course, she has more cash in the bank than I do.

Kids do not need top of the line in every little thing they want.  Good job on telling them it is because you pay the bill, and they can upgrade once they get a job.

Your daughters are spoiled and entitled.\n\nMost people with entry-level jobs can't afford an iPhone 15. Think about the expectations you are setting for your kids.

You would have two different plans with the same place, put it on auto pay and boom don\u2019t have to remember to pay both every month. Then ask ur kids to cover the cost, either of paying for their own phone completely or just the extra $$ a month.

Both daughters are saying they need new phones because they\u2019ve had theirs for a couple years now and they are just not functioning correctly anymore (not holding a charge, glitchy, etc). Husband and I have been looking into options, we\u2019ve recently moved and don\u2019t have much money to work with. One option we found is to drop our current 4 line plan down to 2 lines, and then we found a deal to get 2 new iPhone 15\u2019s with another company and use their service for two lines. So basically we\u2019d have two lines with one company, two with another, and we\u2019d also have to pay an extra $24 per month for each of the iPhone 15\u2019s.\n\nWe told them if we do this option, we would have their phone numbers changed to the iphone 11\u2019s that he and I bought 5 months ago. Still in perfect condition. He and I would get the two new iPhone 15\u2019s. \n\nThey were annoyed that they don\u2019t get the 15\u2019s, because he and I don\u2019t NEED new phones like they do. We say that the 11\u2019s are an upgrade from what they have and are still new phones because they are only a few months old. When one of the girls asked why it is this way instead of them getting them, I replied with \u201cWell because we are the ones who pay the bill\u201d. Pretty straight forward. \n\nWe just relocated across the country and both of them are trying to get jobs (the 19 year old more so), so I did also comment that \u201cWhen you get a job you\u2019re welcome to pay for your own iPhone 15\u201d.\n\nSo, are my husband and I the assholes for keeping the newer phones for ourselves in this (still hypothetical) situation? Should we give in and keep the ones that we currently have (which have been perfectly fine for us) and give our daughters the new ones?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I said no and she had 3 perfectly good phones that if she\u2019d valued and looked after she\u2019d still have. \n\nMy sister tried to take out another contract but her credit rating wasn\u2019t good enough, she pressured her MIL who is disabled and can\u2019t work to take out a contract she couldn\u2019t afford and promised to pay it. \nMy niece had that phone for 8 months before leaving it on a table in a fast food restaurant where it was stolen.

She dropped the phone on the road whilst riding her bike and smashed the screen badly, my sister told her she\u2019d have to use the phone like that until the contract ran out in 2 years.

I upgraded to a 12 as my contact was cheaper and was disappointed that it was more flimsy and the battery was terrible. After 6 months the battery health was at 91%. I switched networks and got the 14 plus which was the best deal at the time. I\u2019ve been really happy with it because it felt like a proper upgrade with a bigger screen and better battery life. \nI\u2019ve read it\u2019s being discontinued now, I\u2019ve been offered the chance to swap my phone because part of my contract means I can upgrade any time but I don\u2019t see the point in swapping it for another phone I\u2019ll use exactly the same. \n\nI nave a friend who still has an iPhone 5s, people tease him about him having a historical relic but he pays \u00a310 a month on a sim only contract and he says the jokes on them for defining people by their phone.

I know that part of why I\u2019ve always been careful with my spending is because I learned in my teens that you do have to make responsible choices even when they\u2019re not what you want.  I\u2019ll be 40 next month, and I\u2019ve never carried credit card debt for more than 60 days except when the dog needed emergency surgery, and part of me being like this has been my parents being honest about their finances when I was 15-18.

Unfortunately, it backfired because the parents agreed with basic idea and the girls are getting newer phones that don\u2019t glitch.  This plan meets their requirements.  The girls just didn\u2019t factor in that their parents would be getting the newest phones, and why shouldn\u2019t they; it\u2019s their money.

Take religion: some parents may raise their kids to be religious, and those kids might come to stop believeing as they get older and form their own opinions. Unfortunately, not every lesson is going to stick, or even if it does, the kids might not follow it every time. \n\nI also wonder why the kids want the newer phones. I think it's less an attitude of \"we deserve better things than our parents\" and more \"we'd use the phones more than them.\" I could see their mentality being \"well, we know a lot more about technology than our parents, so we'd use the features more while they'd just waste them.\" I wouldn't be surprised if the kids thought it was pointless for the parents to get the newer phones if they knew their parents would just use the phones for basic things or if the kids cared more about the technological advantages than their parents. That doesn't make their actions okay, but I don't think they believe their parents should get worse than them due to some superiority complex or something. \n\nKind of like how if your parents got a high spec laptop with a bunch of features and capabilities, and all they did was shop online with it or something. Would you not think it would little sense for them to have gotten it? \n\n>Aside from blaming the parents, you agree that the kids are AHs?\n\nOh, for sure. It's one thing to request new phones and another to push for even better ones when you're already getting an upgrade.", "You're not wrong.\n\nWe could use more info, but my default is to credit parents for their young adults behaviour, for better or worse.  From what we see here, they seem to still be well in OPs sphere of influence.", "That's fair, although I personally think it's easy to blame the parents when it comes to their kid's behavior while ignoring other aspects. I stand by it more with young kids bc their parents are going to be their main influence, but once fhey start getting older, they come into contact with so many new spheres of influence that help shape them into who they are."]}
