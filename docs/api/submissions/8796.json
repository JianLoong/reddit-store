He charges fair prices and works really precise. \nSome of my friends knew I was getting a Tattoo and since it was during the holidays they asked me for a picture of it instead of having to wait until I see them again in school. \nThey too loved the way it turned out and by the time school started pretty much half my class knew about it. \nOne of the girls, let's call her Anna (not her real name), asked me where I got it from because shes planning on getting a tattoo as well. Now, this is where i might be the asshole.\n\n\nAnna has bullied one of my best friends throughout elementary school to the point were my friend would cry everyday. She's still not a nice person, she practically Puts down every girl near her for the things She's insecure of. She will sl*t shame anyone who even dares to wear a semi revealing top in her presense, just to wear an even more revealing Outfit the next day and make her breast her entire personality. I dont mind women showing off their cleavage at all and I would never sl*t shame anyone for it, but considering she will sl*t shame the crap out of you and then sexualize herself the next day honestly disgusts me. \nShe also loves to stab your back and will gossips about her best friend to anyone. She body shames everyone in the room and then outside on a pity Show the moment someone talk back. I have Some friends that cry because of her rudeness at least once a week.\n\nSo, naturally, once she asked me where I got my Tattoo from I immediately redirected her to the Tattoo artist that does a crap job and will almost rot you fir your money. My mom went there once and had to pay 800\u20ac+ for a three hour Session, the Tattoo was done horribly and everyone could tell it was lazy work.\n\nShe already booked an appointment and can't wait for her new Tattoo. All of my friends say I did the right thing and she deserves it, even my mom encouraged me to recommend that crap artist to her. I also think she deserves it for bullying me and all the other girls in class, but my brother says im being the asshole because that will be on her body FOREVER and will also probably put her \"in debt\". So, am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: I probably should've mentioned this earlier, sorry for that. The Tattoo artist I recommended, though he does an awful job, is still a professionell and keeps his work place very clean, gotta give him that. The tattoos Look lazy but he definitely makes sure everything gets doen without any harm or infection. He just completely overcharges for the work he does. Sorry again for only writing this down now.\n\nEDIT: also just to quickly clear some things up, it's not that the Tattoo will look like its been done by a three year old. My mom has a tattoo from that artist and, Whilst the Tattoo itself wasn't TOO bad, the shading, Highlights and Overall Look of it was not it. It doesn't even Look too bad until another professionell will point out all the imperfections. My mom later got it fixed for like 100\u20ac from her regular tattoo artist. There was no need for covering it up or lasering it, just fixing Details and shading/ Highlights.", "created_utc": 1675193834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10q890q/aita_for_recommending_the_worst_tattoo_artist_i/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is an asshole move, \nBut she deserves it and has every chance to research this artist and find out they're not good and do her own research on how much it should cost etc. \nYou didn't force her to immediately book an appointment (without a consultation or quote?), just recommended him.", "NTA. Update with pictures of her tattoo, lol", "Reluctantly, ESH. \n\nHowever constant mental/emotional abuse during the most formative years of brain development is fucked up and she definitely had it coming. The psychological damage that comes from bullying is as permanent as a tattoo, except at least that bully could get her fugly tattoo lasered off whereas she cannot undo the bullshit she's put everyone through. \n\nGood on you, OP. You're doing good.", "I think this is an AH move to do but justified.\n\nBut honestly who doesn't go to IG or a website and look up the work that the artist has done. even when I trust my friends, I still look up the work.", "Another reluctant ESH. \n\nIt would have been better to say, \u201chonestly I have no interest in helping you because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good person\u201d. That\u2019s honest and it takes courage and communicates exactly why you aren\u2019t helping her. \n\nPretending to help someone so that they\u2019ll get something relatively permanent done poorly isn\u2019t a great look and IMO is kind of cowardly.", "you know what, I have to say NTA. Just because you gave her the tattooist's name, doesn't mean she has to go to him. It is ultimately her responsibility to do her due diligence in researching the artist's work and rate.", "NTA\n\nIt's her tattoo and therefore her responsibility to properly do her research. I wouldn't say it was nice to lead her in the wrong direction but she hasn't been nice either.", "Unfortunately, ESH\n\nIs it an AH move to recommend the terrible artist to her? Yes.\n\nIs is an AH move to be a bully, and does she deserve some terrible karma in her life? Also yes. She should also do her own research on an artist. If she does her research and ends up getting a tattoo from them anyways, that's her own fault.\n\nWhile she may deserve it, do you want that resting on your conscience the rest of your life?", "NTA and PLEASE update with a picture of the tattoo and her reaction", "Na, she deserves it. She can have it lasered off. Y'all will spend more in therapy for her bullshit. I would've recommended a dude fresh out of prison who did it on the inside as a hobby.", "YTA\n\nI understand wanting to teach someone a lesson, but this feels like way too much. All these commenters saying N T A are really trying to condone a minor (op)  tricking another minor into getting a bad tattoo. Which is permanent and will cost money to either cover or remove. I understand that she's not the best type of person, so she's being a rotten teenager? Just wait like 1-2 years, and you won't have to see her again.", "Lightly ESH.\n\nShe is a shitty person, and you wouldn't be an asshole for telling her that, but being a shitty person to someone who is a shitty person isn't a good thing.\n\nHopefully, she does her own research and doesn't do any semi permanent damage to her body. Next time, tell her no because she's mean, or take the high road and be the better person.", "Wow, I mean yeah, everything you described would make you a bigger AH for your actions than what she's done. \n\nIf you're looking for people to tell you it's okay to set someone up for this type of damage because they are mean, I'm not that person. \n\nIf you wanted to take another approach and tell her you weren't going to give her the name of y our artist because you think she's a jerk and you don't owe her anything, that would have been helpful. She'd learn something. \n\nBut right now you're set up to be the bigger jerk. Imagine how people will view you when word gets around.", "ESH\n\nAre you an AH? Oh yes, absolutely. You know you are.  \n\nIs she an AH? No question. \n\nYour question isn't really AITA, it's \"is it OKAY that I'm an AH\". \n\nI hate bullies. I mean, I \\*\\*HATE\\*\\* bullies. I was bullied, my sister was bullied, I have lasting trauma over it. I still don't think you should have given her the crap tattoo artist's name. My reasoning is basically: why would you make yourself into the kind of person you hate? How are you any better at that point? Because she did it first? So? You still did it. \n\nIf you think doing this will somehow magically undo all of the trauma she's caused, I think you will be disappointed. You might greatly enjoy this retribution, but it doesn't FIX anything. And she'll be holy-hell pissed afterwards. You may come to truly regret it. \n\nBe better. Do it for yourself. Do it so that you can know that you're a better person, so that you maintain the high road. The whole \"treat people the way you would want them to treat you\" is a really good way to go.", "NTA - it\u2019s called Karma \ud83d\udc51\n\nHey you could\u2019ve mixed the places up cuz you\u2019ve been talking about both places a lot \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f And your Mom got a tattoo there as well.

She could have chosen to have zero tattoos or do a proper research.", "YTA\n\nBut let's be honest; that was the whole point.\n\nTheoretically, society frowns on revenge, but that's exactly what just about everyone wants when they've been wronged.\n\nIf you have a way of getting back at your bully, good for you.
