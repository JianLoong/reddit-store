Having a truck as a college student means that you will help a lot of colleagues move stuff if they do not own a truck. I have helped around 5 colleagues so far, and usually, it takes 3 hours or so, and they would pay for the gas or food or both for using my truck in exchange.\n\nOne of the colleague (21 f) asked me if I can help her move her stuff.

I was surprised and asked her why none of her stuff is prepared to move. She said she was waiting for me. I was extremely annoyed, but still tried to help her. So, I tried to move furniture that really doesn't need boxed in and take it to the new apartment.\n\nWhen I came back, she told me to buy the boxes for her. I asked her for her card or money to buy boxing stuff, but she just said, \"you said you were going to help me move?\" I told her, \"yes, but I am not paying for it,  you have to.\" Also, I told her all the stuff she should have boxed. She keeps complaining that I am not being a good friend. After that, I was done with her at that moment, and I helped her move stuff for free, and now she's asking to buy stuff for her. So I basically left without telling her.\n\nA few days later, I found out, she basically had all of her stuff removed and thrown out by the residential manager, and lost a lot of her stuff and lost all of her deposit.

I was moving cross country along with 2 other people from my school.  We all lived in different houses but we were moving to the same west-coast (US) city so we split the moving cost.  Myself and one of the others were driving the truck in exchange for paying less. The 3rd person had a car, so she was driving separately, but was going to arrive one day earlier than us to ready her apartment.  \n\n\nThe day of moving we rented a single large box truck and paid a few friends to help us actually pack the truck.  I loaded my stuff in about an hour.  Drove to second location and person 2 loaded their stuff in about an hour.    \n\n\nWe drive to the 3rd location and she's -entirely- unpacked, dirty clothes strewn everywhere and no boxes.  She had the same idea as your person, that all the folks would \"help her move\" by actually packing for her.  We loaded all the big stuff but at some point she yelled at one of the helpers for putting dirty laundry in with clean clothes (the clothes were just all over, everything was everywhere) in the trash bags she was using .  She was deeply cruel about it.  We gave her 1 more hour to pack on her own, closed the truck, and left the city.   \n\n\nWhen we got to the new city days later, she still hadn't moved out of her place and was facing angry landlord fees.   She had paid her part of moving in advance and demanded a full refund as well as being compensated for the fees she incurred (mostly from destroying the carpets in the year she lived there).  \n\n\nWe were supposed to unload as a group (just the 3 of us, because none of us had friends on the west coast).  Instead it was just me and the other driver, and her stuff was in the back so had to be removed first.  We also needed to drop off the truck in just a day or two so we couldn't just wait the 3 days, Her new roommate helped us get the stuff into the driveway and then we all just left it there.    \n\n\nYes - It got stolen overnight when no one was around.

Here's the drill:\n\n1. professional movers will pack your stuff (keep an eye on them and get breakage insurance because movers' ability to deal with fragile things varies wildly) and take apart anything that needs taking apart. The moving company brings boxes, paper and bubble wrap, all of which will show up on your bill.  This is called \"pack-up\" and happens *before* the moving truck shows up. In my case, pack-up lasted up to 2.5 days...\n2. When moving yourself or friends, YOU (or THEY) do the boxing and the unboxing. People can ask for help if it's a big job, but people CANNOT expect anyone who offered shifting your things from location A to location B, out of the goodness of their heart, to do any of that for you. \n3. Any associated costs (van rental, gas for borrowed vehicle, boxes, padding) are born by the mover, under all the above scenarios. \n4. If anything breaks, professional movers are usually liable unless you packed the stuff yourself, but check and, as noted above, get insurance. Friends are entitled to say, \"oops, sorry!!! My bad...\" unless they were grossly negligent.\n5. Friends must be supplied with snacks and water throughout the moving day, and with pizza and beer afterwards.

Ned was so taken aback, he gave Paul the $20. They ate the pizza, Paul and his wife thanked Ned for the help and Ned left.\n\nWell, come Monday, \"Michelle\" (the office gossip) asked Ned how things went. Ned tells her the story, including how Paul asked Ned to pay for the pizza and Michelle went CRAZY. She confronted Paul in front of the entire office and said \"Who do you think you  are? Ned comes and helps you for FOUR hours on a Saturday morning and you can't even buy him a goddamn slice of pizza. Get out your wallet and give Ned that $20 RIGHT NOW.\" Paul was so blindsided he did exactly that...and Ned took it!\n\nWell, if Paul wasn't liked before, he was a total pariah at that point.

My friend said :\"Let's go and fetch some strawberries for you, to take home\".   \nSo went we to the place where the strawberries were stored and she handed me two baskets.
