This is horrible behavior.\n\nMaking you out to be the bad person and even insisting you don't live there, so even while you are occupying the room, *as if you are a guest*,  they think it's perfectly acceptable to treat you this way and then tell you that you are out of line.\n\nThat is not ok.\n\nWhich is why I suggested that if they are going to insist you don't live there, then just don't.\n\nIf you can get some counseling at Uni to help with boundaries and unpacking this, please do so.", "Wow, I wish my brother's were like that. All between 21 and 30 and they act like 8 year Olds on sugar rushes. Brother's can be annoying but what can you do. Also, lol 1-2 business days.", "Perhaps the solution is to move her out of that room so that they don\u2019t have to go through \u201cher room\u201d to get to the bathroom.", "We are all grown now but I\u2019m the youngest of 5 girls and we all shared one bathroom (with my mom) and my dad had his own so this sounds fantastic", "He\u2019s definitely annoying sometimes, as a boy going through puberty would be, but my sister, mom, and I always emphasized that women need to be treated with respect, so he tries really hard", "That\u2019s just ridiculous and you know it lol. They could just use another bathroom like normal people \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Or not invade her space at odd hours for long periods of time.\n\nYou\u2019re just arguing for argument\u2019s sake.", "Man I wish, my brother's are all southern boys, jobs in mechanics, love for trucks and jeeps. They got respect for women but they also got southern wife's who throw insults at them from time to time (In a love way) so yea", "I\u2019m not arguing here, you are.", "NTA\n\nYou should take a shower in your sister's room at 11 PM and stay in there til midnight then make a ruckus as you leave. See how they'd like that. According to them you don't even live there so no bathroom is yours, just use whichever one you see fit. Use their logic against them lol", "I think OP is NTA, but I don't think that will work. When you are over 18, don't pay bills, and only live at home part time, you really can't make threats like that without your parents potentially calling your bluff and saying you can find somewhere else to stay."]}
