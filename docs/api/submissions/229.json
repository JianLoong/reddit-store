She joined our secondary school only recently at the start of our 6th/last year. This was also the year where we do one of the most important exams of our lives, which determines which university we\u2019ll go on to study. But because of her Social Anxiety, she never attended school much, absent for weeks. Tbh I have never seen her since I befriended her on the first day\u2026in school that is. She would invite me and two of my friends to hang out constantly. We tried to get her to warm up to school, made plans to get her excited about what we could do in school together, but always on the next day, there\u2019s only a text message \u201csry don\u2019t feel like school today Imao\u201d.\n\nI slowly realised that she never tried to care about her study at all, so I decided I should focus on myself instead of trying to persuade a rock. Because our mocks were coming, every weekend was dedicated to revision. But that did not stop her from asking us to hang out. We tried our best to decline as nice and as possible, she would talk about how lonely she is, and how the school is \u201cabusing us\u201d. Depressed, sad, \u201cliterally crying rn\u201d\u2026she pulled out every card on us. And every conversation ended like we finished a marathon, trying to protect this fragile egg any sort of negativity.\n\nIt was the week before our mocks, ofc all of us were working away in revision. But again she texted us, spamming our names, guess what - she wants to hang out AGAIN. This time I had to decline. But I guess she wasn\u2019t used to being declined this directly. She immediately began to guilt trip me, saying how she had a terrible week (did not go to school), she is under so much stress (like I\u2019m not) and she is super bored and lonely. \nAt this point I had enough, I told her that nothing can make me change my mind, that I\u2019m going insane over the stress too, but I have to face it, and I needed some time to myself. Then she started insulting me, calling me \u201cnerdy\u201d, and being really mean to her, and bringing up her Social Anxiety. \nI responded that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her, we all have problems, and now I\u2019m at a crucial time to face mine, so please leave me alone.\n\nI ignored her messages ever since then, not needing anymore distractions. We\u2019re about a week into our mocks, heard that she has been telling our two mutual friends that I was a horrible person.

It sounds like she has a lot going on in her life outside school. And is needing to use school time to deal with that stuff and to process it. And to feel better, she desperately wants fun time with her busy friends. She probably feels like you don't see how hard her life is and is taking your rejections hard. Social anxiety comes with low self esteem, and everything is colored with self-loathing. You might never be able to accurately empathize, but you can Google it and watch YouTube videos on what it's like. At least read a symptom list. \n\nI've noticed that students who are avoiding of school work tend to not believe in their own abilities, their own intelligence, and feel burnt out. She might never get a \"good job! You're so smart. This is great work. \" at home. It might help if you could give her some positive feedback when she DOES go to school and DOES do school work. That's a big ask for someone your age, but I'm just saying. \n\nAnd on your end, it's valid and commendable that you want to focus on your school work. It's setting yourself up for a bright future. I understand why it's frustrating to have someone pulling you away from something that's important to you. \n\nI think she's hurting pretty badly, and that's where it's coming from; she needs help. is there a school counselor or support groups for students in your area you could show to her?", "NTA - She's a selfish narcissist.  Best case of garbage taking itself out.  #BULLETDODGED", "NTA. Your exam is clearly more important than hanging out with her and if she can't respect that, you should find someone else to be friends with. Also i don't understand what her social anxiety has to do with this, she shouldn't use it as an excuse to be so selfish.", "NTA.  You have a lot going on and you've told her that.  She is taking a different path (no school) so her stresses are different.\n\nShe can make other choices, or maybe turn to her family??? Maybe not, but she is *not* your responsibility.\n\nBlock her number and study hard!", "NTA.  Ignore this energy vampire!", "NTA\nIt sounds like your friend has learned that being sad and lonely is a great way to become the center of attention and get people to hang.\n  \nHas she ever commiserated with any of you over your problems? If not and you're still interested in being friends with her, test her compassion capacity. Next time your are stressed out, reach out and ask for comfort/company from her. If she can give it, great!  If things somehow turn into her problems being the important ones, call her out on it. It will be really telling if you then become the bad guy in the scenario. Then you will know that she really is an energy vampire instead of someone who is figuring out how to be a friend while dealing with social anxiety. \n\nYou can also just decide you are done and block her now. It didn't seem like you were getting much from the friendship to begin with.", "NTA\n\n>I would admit I felt bad, I have never been in the shoes of someone with mental health issues.\n\nWell, I **have** had serious mental health issues, and for real, you're not an AH.\n\nIt's very difficult to set boundaries with someone who's mentally ill and suffering. I get it.\n\nHowever, you cannot set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. You're at a delicate point in time where you **need** to focus and build your future.\n\nYour friend needs to see a therapist, and perhaps a psychiatrist. Her issues are **severe**. Even if you sacrificed the work you're doing to \"help\" her (which would be ridiculous), it won't work, because you aren't qualified to help her.\n\nThe most you should be doing is helping her connect with professionals who can help her make real progress. That would be amazing of you, but it's not required, as you have a lot going on right now and it's not your responsibility.\n\nIf you stopped responding to her completely while you're dealing with all this school stress, I **still** would not call you an AH."]}
