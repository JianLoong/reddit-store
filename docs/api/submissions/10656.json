It was a tough decision, but we both agreed it was for the best. However, things took a turn for the worse when my spouse asked for custody of my dog, who I loved dearly.\n\nNow, let me preface this by saying that my dog is my world. He's been with me since he was a puppy, and I've raised him to be the most well-behaved, loving dog anyone could ask for. My spouse, on the other hand, has never been particularly fond of dogs, and has only recently started showing an interest in our pup.\n\nWhen my spouse asked for custody of my dog, I was absolutely livid. I couldn't believe that she would even suggest taking my dog away from me, especially after everything we had been through together. I calmly told her no, but she wouldn't take no for an answer. She kept insisting that she could provide a better home for our dog, and that I was being selfish by not giving him up.\n\nThat's when things got heated. I started cursing at my spouse, telling her that she had no right to take my dog away from me, and that she was being selfish for even suggesting it. I even went as far as to call her a heartless, selfish witch for what she's doing, trying to gaslight me into giving up my best friend.\n\nMy spouse was taken aback by my outburst, and we ended up parting ways on bad terms. It's been a few days since then, and I've been feeling guilty about the way I acted. On one hand, I feel like my dog is my family, and I would never want to give him up to anyone, even my ex. But on the other hand, I know that I shouldn't have cursed at my spouse like that, and that it wasn't the mature way to handle the situation.", "created_utc": 1677101185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119dyyc/aita_for_calling_my_spouse_a_heartless_witch/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Youre not allowed to verbally abuse a spouse. That's where my \"over a dog\" comment stems from.", "I think the age is relevant because when you're dating someone so young you have a lot of power over them just by nature of having a lot more life experience. Screaming at her like that is just another control tactic.", "You got the dog when you were 23... That would make the dog 15 years old. Are you sure that's accurate? If so, that dog is near end of life and needs as much stability as possible.", "Oh, well then it\u2019s your dog, if she wants a pet she can adopt another dog for herself. Or buy one I guess, either way.  NTA in my opinion", "Oh noooo! Not his *spouse!* \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31", "How often is that?", "You need to expound on \"whenever\" you weren't able to. And how old is the dog?", "me too, i reread it and was like.. wait a minute.", "Can you explain what she did that she needs to take responsibility for?", "Hate to break it to you mate but 12 years is substantially greater than 4...", "I agree, it should be that way. Some states unfortunately only see pets as property and not the living, breathing family members that they actually are.", "That\u2019s fair, but I still think the screaming was too much. Also the age gap.", "It\u2019s a divorce lol she wants the dog. Going to be a long court battle.", "So you have no issue splitting up the pack? That is not good for them psychologically.", "I went more into detail in the comments-but go off I guess\u2026", "The comparison is irrelevant. There is a line we must draw at which we hold people accountable for the sexual and romantic relationships that they choose to engage in, and that line falls well before the age of 20.", "Lmao \"It was TWO YEARS since she became an adult! Obviously that's not time enough to mature\"", "You're delusional. She doesn't even like the dog and didn't help raise or train it.", "Or maybe, just maybe, he was just mad. People have the right to emotions, you know? \u201cControl tactic\u201d Jesus I\u2019m tired of these Reddit psychologists. Did he go too far? Sounds like it. But I don\u2019t think age has anything to do with this topic", "Probably 2-4 times a month at most due to job meetings and other business", "How many years is too many then? Explain your reasoning.\n\nPeople either have autonomy over their decisions or they don't. You can find it icky all you want but at 20 most of us could make up our minds about who we wanted to sleep with.", "Yeah but you going into more detail completely ignored the fact that he said he\u2019s the one that takes care of the dog. Then you brought up the irrelevant topic again so\u2026", "Are you her? OP says she warmed up and likes the dog. OP also won't give specifics about why she would think she'd take better care. Also, he hasn't mentioned who would take care of the dog while he's away. He is only selectively responding.", "I won't mention my psychology masters then. Lmao.", "Why does your ex feel she can provide a better life for said dog?", "2-4 times a month is alot, though. Especially for dogs as they are pack animals and are attached to their owners so much. \n\nHow long are you gone each time? That can also make a difference. I had a time in my life where I was gone 2 times a month for work, but it was just one night each time so a total of 2 nights a month. Not terrible but I am glad my circumstances have changed. \n\nRemember,  you are your dog's whole world.", "The difference between 21 and 25 is fairly small in terms of maturity emotionally/socially/sexually. The difference between 20 and 32.on these areas is enormous. It's more than a little worrying that that needed to be said...\n\nAn age gap becomes less of an issue as we age, e.g. the difference in these areas between a 40 and a 55 year old would be very small, possibly non existent. The issue is not the size of the age gap, it's the timing/positioning of the age gap.", "This sub goes full smooth-brain whenever an age gap relationship pops up. It\u2019s both frustrating and hilarious how little nuance exists here", "I\u2019m sure you have one. How convenient", "A Masters in Psychology means nothing lmao. We don\u2019t know what your thesis was in and how qualified you are. Plus for a 28 day account and having that much karma how do you even have the time", "Please just answer the question I asked.\n\nHow many years is too many? Explain your reasoning.\n\nYour answer should be a number in years. Your reasoning should explain why one more year would be inappropriate.", "Well, I thought it was ironic.", "Chill out! I just thought it was hilariously ironic they said they were sick of psychologists. Where's your sense of humour? \n\nI don't even get the relevance of your last point, but it says a lot about your psychology that you had to look me up. *Wink wink*", "I'm not answering it because it's the wrong question. This isn't going to work if you choose to be deliberately obtuse.", "Reddit psychologists are different than actual psychologists. Reddit psychologists are random people who make assumptions based on nothing. Actual Psychologists have a PHD in Psychology and would find it to be immature to make assumptions based on a post.", "You can't answer because there isn't really an answer.\n\nAn adult can decide for themselves who they want to be with. It's logistically impossible to legislate on a case by case basis so we pick a common sense cutoff.\n\nSorry if you didn't feel like an adult at 20, most of us however could decide whether we wanted to be with someone at that age.\n\nYou people whining about who other adults date all sound foolish.", "That's a wild assumption to make that people with a PHD don't have fun on Reddit. In fact, I think you'll find that a lot of  PHD students have a lot of time to spend on Reddit! \n\n You need to get a funny bone. Irony is totally lost on you.", "I literally answered you in my first comment about the size not being the issue, that the timing was. If you're just going deliberately ignore things I've said then what are we doing? Am I allowed to just totally ignore things you say as well? And really? I've been with my partner since I was 15 you really want to play the stupid game of \"wElL iM mOre oF an aDUlT tHAn yOu\"? Jesus Christ get a grip.", "I know people that have an MD that are on Reddit. What the previous commenter meant by Reddit Psychologists, they were referring to Arm chair psychologists not Actual psychologists that are on reddit"]}
