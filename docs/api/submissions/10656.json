It was a tough decision, but we both agreed it was for the best. However, things took a turn for the worse when my spouse asked for custody of my dog, who I loved dearly.\n\nNow, let me preface this by saying that my dog is my world. He's been with me since he was a puppy, and I've raised him to be the most well-behaved, loving dog anyone could ask for. My spouse, on the other hand, has never been particularly fond of dogs, and has only recently started showing an interest in our pup.\n\nWhen my spouse asked for custody of my dog, I was absolutely livid. I couldn't believe that she would even suggest taking my dog away from me, especially after everything we had been through together. I calmly told her no, but she wouldn't take no for an answer. She kept insisting that she could provide a better home for our dog, and that I was being selfish by not giving him up.\n\nThat's when things got heated. I started cursing at my spouse, telling her that she had no right to take my dog away from me, and that she was being selfish for even suggesting it. I even went as far as to call her a heartless, selfish witch for what she's doing, trying to gaslight me into giving up my best friend.\n\nMy spouse was taken aback by my outburst, and we ended up parting ways on bad terms. It's been a few days since then, and I've been feeling guilty about the way I acted. On one hand, I feel like my dog is my family, and I would never want to give him up to anyone, even my ex. But on the other hand, I know that I shouldn't have cursed at my spouse like that, and that it wasn't the mature way to handle the situation.", "created_utc": 1677101185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119dyyc/aita_for_calling_my_spouse_a_heartless_witch/", "score": 1579, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
