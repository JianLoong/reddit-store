Sorry not sorry.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife took in the pet belonging to her recently deceased mom.  \n\nThe person making the argument about choosing a person over a cat is absurd - it wasn't as if you were taking the one you didn't choose to the pound.  You simply changed the working environment enough so that the arrangement didn't work for your nanny.  She chose to move out in the least professional way possible. \n\nI know it's tough, but tell your wife she needs to let go of the negativity that the person sending the note clearly intended her to feel.

Since when does an employee get to call the shots over something like this?", "NTA the nanny isn\u2019t a family member.  It\u2019s a job.  She threatened to quit if you didn\u2019t adjust to her demands and you had no problem with her quitting.

Anyone who expects you to \u2018get rid\u2019 of a deceased parents cat is completely heartless and insensitive.\n\nUltimately the cat came into your life and your life and your wife wanted the cat to stay.

Doesn't sound like you booted her--she moved out on her own timeline.", "NTA, and it is super weird if the nanny actually has her friends texting you. Nannies are employees. They don\u2019t get to demand that you get rid of a pet, but they are free to give their notice.", "True. And if OP ever feels this is too stark a light to put it in, consider that the employee apparently resorted to giving out OP\u2019s personal contact information to a stranger who then thought it was appropriate to send a hostile text. Sounds like OP dodged a longer term bullet here.", "Great way to put it", "Okay, but OP says the nanny MOVED OUT.\n\nThis was a live-in nanny, and they made the house impossible for her to live in, with no notice.  I don't know how it works for folks like Nannies, if they have even the basic protections that say, a roommate would have...  but I think it's an AH thing to do to move a pet into a house when someone else lives there, without giving them a head's up.\n\nIt's not that the nanny doesn't like cats, it's that she's allergic, there was NO way she should stay...  so she just lost her job and her housing with no notice, and it doesn't sound like, any compensation to help her find a new place.\n\nIf this was a situation where one roommate moved a pet in without consulting their other roommates, or giving them appropriate notice, we would all call them AHs for it.  The fact that OP is also this person's boss means OP has more power over the nanny than just a roommate situation, and when you have more power over someone's livelihood, you have MORE responsibility to act fairly to them.", "OP wasn't just this woman's boss, he was also her landlord.  She would have accepted the job under the condition that it was a pet free home, and OP changed the conditions of both her job, and her housing, with no notice and no compensation to find new housing.  That makes him (and his wife) the AH.\n\nI don't know why you think SHE was being unprofessional.  When you change the working conditions of your employees with no notice, you shouldn't expect them to hang around.  It's not like she could just put her allergies on hold for a couple weeks to give notice.  HE was in a position to give her notice, but didn't, so why should an employee owe more respect to a boss than the boss is showing them?", "It's not even a threat - it's a reasonable exchange. \"I can't work for you if you have a cat because I have an allergy\" is a NAH scenario. It puts the ball in the court of the employer to make the choices best for his family.", "Plus nanny really burned the bridge. Good luck getting a reference from OP now. NTA", "I guess it depends what you mean by notice. My mother-in-laws death was unexpected so we brought the cat into our home with essentially no notice. We would have given her time and wouldn't have expected her to leave right away though, but so much was going on and she left before we had a chance to talk about it further.", "I agree they should pay the nanny severance but that\u2019s more just to be really nice. But OP NTA bc the nanny put the ultimatum in place and chose to quit", "Elsewhere in the comments the OP says the nanny could've stayed as long as she needed to. She's the one that left after 4 days.", "She's the one who left on her own accord, they don't detail how much time they gave her. She probably decided to leave when they didn't gave into her demands. Even if she's an aupair, she left on her own accord after demanding something the family which she had no right to demand. \n\nA mature approach from her part would be to *ask* for filters (there's air filters that help people with allergies), that the person who cleans vacuums more often so she wouldn't have to be in contact with hair as much, and that the cat be fed a special kibble that helps them not be allergenic. Demanding they kick the cat out when 1) she's not a member of the family but an employee, and 2) the cat has sentimental value to the family's mother is both mean and immatre.", "No. The nanny chose to quit. You don\u2019t get severance when you quit.", "She said she was allergic to the cat\n\nWe didn't get a chance to talk about a timeline.\n\nWe didn't have a contract.", "Allergy shots are a thing. I was allergic to anything with fur or feathers. Post-allergy shots- no problem with dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, etc.", "you gotta take into consideration the cat was the OP's late MIL's cat. So the pet has sentimental value to the OP's wife. A pet like that can't and will never be able to be replaced. So that part is kinda insensitive to say. (and even then, no pet can ever be replaced.)", "Well, we've since decided not to get another nanny. My wife wants to be a stay at home mom for now.", "Where does it say she\u2019s allergic?", "She never asked us to write a reference.", "We never got asked for a reference.", "I'm inclined to believe it's the nanny herself sending the text from a different number.  She's pissed she hasn't found herself the same type of job and is lashing out.", "We don't know how this person got OP's number, it being freely given out by the nanny seems like the least likely of multiple other options, considering how long it's been (4 months).\n\nIf OP got messages right away, I would think that might be more likely, but after this long, that screams that someone's been upset and it took them 4 months to track down OP's info.", "If you did it to a roommate it would be a TA situation because the roommate pays to stay in the space and it is a reasonable accomodation to expect to be able to live and breathe without an allergic reaction in your house that you pay for.\n\nThe nanny's labor made it so she was *paid* to live there though. It is reasonable for her to expect a clean and livable working environment \u2014 but then the requirements of the environment changed (being able to put up with an animal) and she was no longer the right fit. It's perfectly reasonable that the job requirements can shift and you can not be the right person to fulfill the need anymore, at which point you're let go.\n\nA bigger issue IMO is that most nannies have an item regarding severance in their contract if they're forced to leave abruptly and not work their 2 weeks or whatever. It would've been a kind thing to do to pay that out given the weird no contract thing OP had with her. It all should've been laid out way in advance TBH and OP not doing so comes off really bad.", "If this is an at-will state, employment is exactly that, at will.", "I think the nanny saying little about it and then moving out while they were gone is, at best, peculiar. The implication that the nanny also gave out their number to a friend (or changed her number?) to harass them later shifts this, imo, into the nanny's behavior not being great here.", "True, if nanny was demanding the cat be removed or threated the cat nanny would be an AH. Though having a friend bombard your employer is extreme.", "It\u2019s a the nanny is AH because she gave out the OPs number and nw someone messaged him to berate him", "But the cat was already there right? So you effectifly threw her im the streets with no notice.\nWhat was her pay? Was she legally payed?", "Info, were you going to continue paying her 2 weeks notice? \nIf she continued to live there and help regardless of if your wife was home or not.  \nI mean it would be pretty rude if you had told her you were planning on leaving her high and dry without notice.  I know some employers do it.  But when I've been laid off I've received severance.", "Depending on the level of the allergies, it may not have been really a choice to stay. \n\nI guess, I just don\u2019t have the info I need. \n\nAnd yes-the severance is to be nice-which is 100% warranted here.\n\nThat said, please understand that I think whoever messaged the wife is the biggest AH in the entire situation.", "But we don\u2019t know the level of the allergies, so I think it\u2019s a bit presumptuous to think we know the solution would be air filters and/or kibble. Her leaving was after they terminated agreement, and yes, you\u2019re correct that we don\u2019t know how much time they gave her, but again if your allergies were impacting this, it could explain leaving in a hurry without being an AH for it. \n\nI agree that OP and family have a right to keep the cat over her, but what OP wrote is that she said that if they didn\u2019t get rid of the cat, she would have to leave. That isn\u2019t a demand. That\u2019s an ultimatum. OP was given a choice, chose, and thus, chose to terminate the contract with the nanny.\n\nRegardless, whoever messaged OP was also in the wrong. OP didn\u2019t leave her homeless.\n\nI don\u2019t think they are major AHs (only softly) but because live-in nannie\u2019s are compensated at least partially via accommodation, severance is definitely appropriate here.", "OP effectively fired her when they introduced a permanent allergen into her living and working environment.", ">We didn't have a contract.\n\nYou didn't have a contract for a live in nanny?\n\nWere you paying her above board?  Paying employment taxes, etc?", "i did allergy shots from when i was like 11 until i was 16 and they helped with my grass allergy, but not animals. cats are the most severe and then rabbits. \n\nin college, i dated a guy with a cat... we. tried. everything. every time i came over, he would vacuum the hell out of his room, febreze, shut the vents from the rest of the house. we replaced air filters, got an air purifier, and i tried every kind of otc allergy medicine out there, just in case one worked. but nothing worked. i still couldn't be there for more than 15 minutes without feeling like i was trying to breathe through a napkin.\n\nmaybe i'm just a freak and allergy shots would work for OP's nanny, but wouldn't they take like months to be effective?", "That\u2019s a great resolution to the problem!", "Second sentence", "Employment may be \"at-will\", but he's also her landlord, depending on the state, if she's been living there for a given period of time, whether she's explicitly paying rent or not, she's a tenant, and OP would be required to give her notice.  You might say \"but she left willingly\", but most states recognize some degree of wrong doing on a landlord that makes a house \"unlivable\", which is what OP did here.\n\nAlso - even in at-will states, there's the concept of Constructive Discharge, the nanny should have applied for unemployment...  though I doubt OP was paying her legally...", "Doesnt make it morally ok.", "Those are logical leaps. I've had immature friends steal numbers off my phone for a variety of reasons, and while they're no longer friends of mine, it's certainly not outside the realm that a well-meaning friend thought she could give him a piece of her mind for putting her bestie out.", "OP said she left on her own while they were out of the house. It doesnt sound like they were rushing her to leave. Also nanny was the one that set the ultimatum and leaving was her reaction to their response.", "We would have been fine with her continuing to work for us for however long she needed until she found a new job.", ">But we don\u2019t know the level of the allergies, so I think it\u2019s a bit presumptuous to think we know the solution would be air filters and/or kibble. \n\nShe would know, tho, you know how serious your allergies are because you live with them.\n\nSo it's HER who would offer the solutions because it's HER problem, not theirs. And she could've sent a text right after explaining why she had to leave... if they were severe tho, she would've left that same night or the morning after. If the text IS from a friend she clearly knows people there and could've stayed with someone or booked a room. Live in nannies make good money because they don't have to pay rent, utilities, nor food, at least in my country food is included, so most of the money can be saved or used on herself.  \n\n\nAlso, OP has clarified they were willing to talk more about it, but she just upped and left without notice. There was also no contract.\n\nSo OP and his NTA, but she and her \"friend\" are, her for playing the victim when she wasn't and giving out a private number and her \"friend\" for messaging... if there was a friend even.", "yes", "The serum used for the shots must be formulated to include the pet allergies. Is it possible the doctor or clinic only used one targeting grass pollen?", "How do you expect her to continue to work for you when the thing she's allergic to is wandering around her home and workplace?\n\nYou'd be cool with her hacking, sneezing and coughing her way through her day?  You'd be fine with paying the bill for epi-pens and hospital stays if her allergies were that severe?\n\nThat's like saying you're happy to have someone with a peanut allergy over for lunch, as long as they don't mind eating nothing but peanut butter sandwiches for lunch...\n\nhow do you not understand that there was no way she could continue to live or work in your house?"]}
