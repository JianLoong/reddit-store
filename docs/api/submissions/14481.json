Sounds like OP dodged a longer term bullet here.", "Great way to put it", "Okay, but OP says the nanny MOVED OUT.\n\nThis was a live-in nanny, and they made the house impossible for her to live in, with no notice.  I don't know how it works for folks like Nannies, if they have even the basic protections that say, a roommate would have...  but I think it's an AH thing to do to move a pet into a house when someone else lives there, without giving them a head's up.\n\nIt's not that the nanny doesn't like cats, it's that she's allergic, there was NO way she should stay...  so she just lost her job and her housing with no notice, and it doesn't sound like, any compensation to help her find a new place.\n\nIf this was a situation where one roommate moved a pet in without consulting their other roommates, or giving them appropriate notice, we would all call them AHs for it.  The fact that OP is also this person's boss means OP has more power over the nanny than just a roommate situation, and when you have more power over someone's livelihood, you have MORE responsibility to act fairly to them.", "OP wasn't just this woman's boss, he was also her landlord.  She would have accepted the job under the condition that it was a pet free home, and OP changed the conditions of both her job, and her housing, with no notice and no compensation to find new housing.  That makes him (and his wife) the AH.\n\nI don't know why you think SHE was being unprofessional.  When you change the working conditions of your employees with no notice, you shouldn't expect them to hang around.  It's not like she could just put her allergies on hold for a couple weeks to give notice.  HE was in a position to give her notice, but didn't, so why should an employee owe more respect to a boss than the boss is showing them?", "It's not even a threat - it's a reasonable exchange. \"I can't work for you if you have a cat because I have an allergy\" is a NAH scenario.

Even if she's an aupair, she left on her own accord after demanding something the family which she had no right to demand. \n\nA mature approach from her part would be to *ask* for filters (there's air filters that help people with allergies), that the person who cleans vacuums more often so she wouldn't have to be in contact with hair as much, and that the cat be fed a special kibble that helps them not be allergenic. Demanding they kick the cat out when 1) she's not a member of the family but an employee, and 2) the cat has sentimental value to the family's mother is both mean and immatre.", "No. The nanny chose to quit.

She's pissed she hasn't found herself the same type of job and is lashing out.", "We don't know how this person got OP's number, it being freely given out by the nanny seems like the least likely of multiple other options, considering how long it's been (4 months).\n\nIf OP got messages right away, I would think that might be more likely, but after this long, that screams that someone's been upset and it took them 4 months to track down OP's info.", "If you did it to a roommate it would be a TA situation because the roommate pays to stay in the space and it is a reasonable accomodation to expect to be able to live and breathe without an allergic reaction in your house that you pay for.\n\nThe nanny's labor made it so she was *paid* to live there though. It is reasonable for her to expect a clean and livable working environment \u2014 but then the requirements of the environment changed (being able to put up with an animal) and she was no longer the right fit. It's perfectly reasonable that the job requirements can shift and you can not be the right person to fulfill the need anymore, at which point you're let go.\n\nA bigger issue IMO is that most nannies have an item regarding severance in their contract if they're forced to leave abruptly and not work their 2 weeks or whatever. It would've been a kind thing to do to pay that out given the weird no contract thing OP had with her. It all should've been laid out way in advance TBH and OP not doing so comes off really bad.", "If this is an at-will state, employment is exactly that, at will.", "I think the nanny saying little about it and then moving out while they were gone is, at best, peculiar. The implication that the nanny also gave out their number to a friend (or changed her number?) to harass them later shifts this, imo, into the nanny's behavior not being great here.", "True, if nanny was demanding the cat be removed or threated the cat nanny would be an AH. Though having a friend bombard your employer is extreme.", "It\u2019s a the nanny is AH because she gave out the OPs number and nw someone messaged him to berate him", "But the cat was already there right? So you effectifly threw her im the streets with no notice.\nWhat was her pay? Was she legally payed?", "Info, were you going to continue paying her 2 weeks notice? \nIf she continued to live there and help regardless of if your wife was home or not.  \nI mean it would be pretty rude if you had told her you were planning on leaving her high and dry without notice.  I know some employers do it.  But when I've been laid off I've received severance.", "Depending on the level of the allergies, it may not have been really a choice to stay. \n\nI guess, I just don\u2019t have the info I need. \n\nAnd yes-the severance is to be nice-which is 100% warranted here.\n\nThat said, please understand that I think whoever messaged the wife is the biggest AH in the entire situation.", "But we don\u2019t know the level of the allergies, so I think it\u2019s a bit presumptuous to think we know the solution would be air filters and/or kibble. Her leaving was after they terminated agreement, and yes, you\u2019re correct that we don\u2019t know how much time they gave her, but again if your allergies were impacting this, it could explain leaving in a hurry without being an AH for it. \n\nI agree that OP and family have a right to keep the cat over her, but what OP wrote is that she said that if they didn\u2019t get rid of the cat, she would have to leave. That isn\u2019t a demand. That\u2019s an ultimatum. OP was given a choice, chose, and thus, chose to terminate the contract with the nanny.\n\nRegardless, whoever messaged OP was also in the wrong. OP didn\u2019t leave her homeless.\n\nI don\u2019t think they are major AHs (only softly) but because live-in nannie\u2019s are compensated at least partially via accommodation, severance is definitely appropriate here.", "OP effectively fired her when they introduced a permanent allergen into her living and working environment.", ">We didn't have a contract.\n\nYou didn't have a contract for a live in nanny?\n\nWere you paying her above board?  Paying employment taxes, etc?", "i did allergy shots from when i was like 11 until i was 16 and they helped with my grass allergy, but not animals. cats are the most severe and then rabbits. \n\nin college, i dated a guy with a cat... we. tried. everything. every time i came over, he would vacuum the hell out of his room, febreze, shut the vents from the rest of the house. we replaced air filters, got an air purifier, and i tried every kind of otc allergy medicine out there, just in case one worked. but nothing worked. i still couldn't be there for more than 15 minutes without feeling like i was trying to breathe through a napkin.\n\nmaybe i'm just a freak and allergy shots would work for OP's nanny, but wouldn't they take like months to be effective?", "That\u2019s a great resolution to the problem!", "Second sentence", "Employment may be \"at-will\", but he's also her landlord, depending on the state, if she's been living there for a given period of time, whether she's explicitly paying rent or not, she's a tenant, and OP would be required to give her notice.  You might say \"but she left willingly\", but most states recognize some degree of wrong doing on a landlord that makes a house \"unlivable\", which is what OP did here.\n\nAlso - even in at-will states, there's the concept of Constructive Discharge, the nanny should have applied for unemployment...  though I doubt OP was paying her legally...", "Doesnt make it morally ok.", "Those are logical leaps. I've had immature friends steal numbers off my phone for a variety of reasons, and while they're no longer friends of mine, it's certainly not outside the realm that a well-meaning friend thought she could give him a piece of her mind for putting her bestie out.", "OP said she left on her own while they were out of the house. It doesnt sound like they were rushing her to leave. Also nanny was the one that set the ultimatum and leaving was her reaction to their response.", "We would have been fine with her continuing to work for us for however long she needed until she found a new job.", ">But we don\u2019t know the level of the allergies, so I think it\u2019s a bit presumptuous to think we know the solution would be air filters and/or kibble. \n\nShe would know, tho, you know how serious your allergies are because you live with them.\n\nSo it's HER who would offer the solutions because it's HER problem, not theirs. And she could've sent a text right after explaining why she had to leave... if they were severe tho, she would've left that same night or the morning after. If the text IS from a friend she clearly knows people there and could've stayed with someone or booked a room. Live in nannies make good money because they don't have to pay rent, utilities, nor food, at least in my country food is included, so most of the money can be saved or used on herself.  \n\n\nAlso, OP has clarified they were willing to talk more about it, but she just upped and left without notice. There was also no contract.\n\nSo OP and his NTA, but she and her \"friend\" are, her for playing the victim when she wasn't and giving out a private number and her \"friend\" for messaging... if there was a friend even.", "yes", "The serum used for the shots must be formulated to include the pet allergies.

You'd be fine with paying the bill for epi-pens and hospital stays if her allergies were that severe?\n\nThat's like saying you're happy to have someone with a peanut allergy over for lunch, as long as they don't mind eating nothing but peanut butter sandwiches for lunch...\n\nhow do you not understand that there was no way she could continue to live or work in your house?", "NTA. The way you wrote it, you didn\u2019t kick her out the day of. You told her she could look for other options.

Or know how rare it is for a pet allergy to be that sever? I say this as a person who gets hives everyday from dust. I know a lot of ppl who hate cats and say it\u2019s an allergy and while I don\u2019t want to inflict allergies on anyone I have seen people with pets manage to work around this by keeping them away and regular cleaning, there is no way i believe drs have confined allergy to at least 70% of the people I met who say this and by the way she attacked them after I would believe that\u2019s possible with this lady. I\u2019m allergic to cats but I love them, and when I\u2019m at places with them I interact albeit my skin may get a tad itchy  it\u2019s taken a long time to get from runny nose to this point but it\u2019s not like anyone is forcing this cat to be touched by nanny. she actually gave the ultimatum and they don\u2019t owe her any loyalty to put out a cat, shelters are over ran and their kid is happy. Nanny sounds unhinged anyway.", "NTA.\n\nA job is a job.", "YTA, not because of the decision (totally makes sense and would make the same myself, hands down) but because you basically made her living situation unviable with no notice, then failed to communicate what you were willing or not willing to do to help give her time to find a new living situation. \n\nLike, she was living there. Then you made it impossible for her to live there, and then said \"also you can stop working (aka being paid) immediately\". I'd assume you meant for me to book it asap, too! What else was she supposed to think? I imagine being smacked out of left field like that and then having no one even care enough to let me know what interim options were or weren't available to me, and I feel for that nanny.\n\nWhen did you tell her how long she'd have to move out or ask what her prospects were? If she's served you well, where is the discussion/assurance where you talk about compromises like what can be done in the brief interim to make the house safe for her to live in while she works on moving out? You act like her moving out was a surprise... so, you just let her assume the worst over a period of days when all it would take is a simple call or chat???\n\nIt isn't the nanny's job to tell you how to manage your home and her place in it. That's on you, as owners of the home and her former employer. And I get you're having a rough time, but you dropped the ball on this. Yeah, you should keep the cat and lose the nanny, and sudden change is not your fault. But you absolutely took away someone's livelihood and living space in less than a week with no lead time to make other arrangements (and no it is not like being fired, as she presumably did an okay job at least), and you didn't seem to care much at all about what that would mean for them. If you were willing to let her stay any longer than the four days it took her to find *something*, you can't not communicate that's okay at all and then go whelp, that was her decision to go so we have no responsibility for it! You gave her no reason to expect otherwise.\n\nLook, all this to say... No, you didn't make the wrong decision and no you shouldn't have to put up with weird messages. But yeah, learn to communicate, and next time consider the kindness of boarding the cat for a week or having family care for it at least until the person with bad allergies can get out.", "YTA. Not for taking in the cat, but for not dealing with it correctly. Since this was a live in nanny, who's home was your home, as soon as you found out the nanny was allergic and you had made both their home and work environment toxic to their health, you should have had the cat stay with a friend or in a a boarding place, and given the nanny a months notice. That way they had time to find more employment and somewhere to live. Then brought the cat in to live with you.", "So your nanny depended on you for employment and shelter, and with zero percent notice, you forced her to start having medical issues.

Insert a pause while OP and his wife discuss the issue or pretend they are discussing the issue. Here's where the difference lies. When they need to present to the nanny that the cat is staying, that's the point at which terms should've been discussed, and the terms absolutely should've included two weeks of pay if not a month of pay. Remember that OP's wife is going to be at home with the child so there won't immediately be nanny expenses. I think I would vote for severance being the right thing to do even if they were immediately going with another nanny but the fact that they will have that money unapent makes it a slam dunk.\n\nAnd after the severance was discussed, they should've discussed dates.

From what I know about the inequalities of care work and live-in-nannies, they probably did not have a proper contract. Everyone seems so adamant about the fact that this is a work situation and OP can just fire her yada yada, while OP did not treat this like a normal work termination either. The nanny made an accommodation request and OP basically told her that he won't do anything about it. Of course, the nanny is forced to quit because her working and living conditions are not proper/safe. It would have been OP's responsibility to either find a solution or at least give her proper notice, etc at that moment. I do not know in which country OP is situated, but labor rights also apply to nannies.  \n\nNow moving on to my speculations. If there had been a contract, the nanny would not have just left like that or would have tried to make use of her rights. And y'all can probably deduce why there was no contract. In the grand scheme of things, domestic workers are underpaid, undervalued, and exploited. For OP it seems like he made a choice for his family, meanwhile, that choice came from a position of entitlement and privilege. And if my speculations are right and the nanny is/was an illegal domestic worker, then OP clearly abused the power dynamics.

It\u2019s not something I could just put up with.", "I suspect there was no offer of severance and if she has an allergy the situation was medically unsafe for her. Also, the OP said his wife was going to stay home and did not need her. If the people I worked for and lived with did not care about my allergies and did not offer me severance I would have gotten the hell out of their too. She may be asthmatic and fear a bad asthma attack.", "I understand wanting to keep the cat, and don't think they were wrong for doing so. But they could have properly acknowledged the fact that by doing so they were making her jobless and homeless with no notice, and compensated her accordingly.", "You should have immediately made it clear that you'd give a good reference and a decent severance package, to take account of the fact that you were making both her home and work environment untenable with no notice.\n\nDid you do this?", "You have never answered if you gave her severance or offered to board the cat or put her up in a hotel for a week or two while she found another job. How did you accommodate her?", "I mean OP doesn't say anywhere that they were unwilling to let her stay for a while until she found other options - she moved out within a few days and with no heads up about it.\n\nNTA.", "I suspect she moved out because she is ALLERGIC to cats.", "Board it? Have a friend or family member keep it for a little? They made this woman\u2019s home unliveable for her with no notice, and she also became suddenly unemployed - I don\u2019t think a week at the kitty daycare is unreasonable", "It\u2019s a longterm solution. Much more effective than using benadryl for the rest of your life.", "The post says she up and left when they were not home.  In those few days, she could have sat down with them about severance and timing etc.", "She gets a salary as well, live in is just one part of her total compensation.", "What, a dead family member leaving a beloved cat that the daughter didn't want to give up? Yeah not morally ok for nanny to expect all that, it's actually horrible that in the family's hardest times she really did that.", "Sure but that doesn\u2019t help the nanny in the short/medium term?", "Maybe it is a relative of the OP and his wife who think they are awful for not doing more for the nanny. Nothing the OP posted shows they care in any way for the nanny. They showed her no contest and no grace. I do not see where they agreed to give her a few days without the cat to move out or find another job. No mention of severance.", "Nanny quit and moved out.  There is no solution that involves her at this point. My response was for the comment above mine i.e. a redditor that has serious allergies.", "It wasn't HER home tho, it was her live in workplace. She may have been entitled to severance but she left when no one was home so clearly she didn't care THAT much.", "Does dead mother mean anything to you, or you only care about the literal staff member who care bugger off and find another job, if that was my home the cat would also be staying, family over staff. Staff who are no longer a fit for the job are very replaceable and she left on her own accord.", "Maybe she left because she is allergic to cats and the OP and his wife did not care. Did he give her money to find a new place to live and have secure housing because of an out of the blue change?", ">It wasn't HER home tho, it was her live in workplace.\n\nThis. If a bakery started serving food made with peanuts, an employee might have to switch jobs. The only difference here is that she lived there, but I don't understand why she wouldn't have a backup plan in case she had to leave at any point. What if they had to let her go for financial reasons?", "You do not know that. They weren\u2019t the assholes for taking the cat. It\u2019s how they fucked over this woman that makes them an asshole. They could have boarded the cat while she moved out. They could have given her a severance package. This was no fault of hers- or the families. But they handled it horribly.", "I don\u2019t think op should have changed that he took the cat. I think he should have boarded the cat for a week or two, given the nanny a recommendation, and a severance package. That would have been moral. Staff might be replaceable- and wow you\u2019re kinda a peach for implying people are worth less than cats- but when you make someone live with you to fulfill a job, you have extra responsibilities for them than if it was simply a job you punch out of.", "Sorry to me human over cats. Also, human that has lived in my home and cared for my child over a cat.", "Long term use of antihistamines increases your likelihood of getting dementia.", "There are varying degrees of allergies. I have some pretty severe allergies and when exposed the volume of antihistamine I need to get over them knocks me on my feet for days but also dry my mouth and nose out so much I can not sleep and my tongue cracks. Sometimes I get bad asthma attacks. If the OP wanted to keep the cat they could have boarded it for a few weeks to allow the nanny time to move out and should have given her a good severance package. I am guessing she was underpaid and disposable to them. They obviously did not care about them as a person.", "Maybe, but maybe they didn't have the money or the mental health to deal with that. She shouldn't have dipped out while no one was home if she wanted severance.", "Your comment is the best. I suspect the nanny is the person texting. OP and his wife seem awful.", "I've heard that Benadryl in particular can raise that risk, but I haven't heard that about antihistamines in general. I take them daily for an autoimmune disorder and have for years. No doctor has ever informed me of such a risk.", "Ah yes, having to disclose your health issues before you take a job is *definitely* legal and not at all against the ADA."]}
