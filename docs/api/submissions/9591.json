One of my courses is an online class (the subject doesn\u2019t really matter) so there\u2019s a group chat with most of my other classmates which we use to help each other out, answer questions and so on. I\u2019m fairly familiar with this subject so some topics I can understand and explain to classmates who don\u2019t. There\u2019s one classmate in particular who asks me for help more than anyone else (to the point where they private message me). \n\nNow, I understand being scared to ask a \u201cdumb\u201d question, not sure how to word a question or ask for help, but it\u2019s gotten really out of hand and I want to know if i\u2019m being rude. At first, they would ask me to explain certain topics, which I did. Then, it quickly turned into them taking a picture of a question and asking for the answer(s). Of course I didnt wanna be that person; I know college is hard and we\u2019re all trying to get by but I knew that if I kept giving them the answers then they would have no motivation to learn the topics on their own. \n\nWhat really pissed me off was the week of the test. Now, the online course gives us a 3-day window to take the in-person, proctored test. I took it on day 1, others took it on day 2 or 3. Taking it on day 1 just meant that I could tell others what to focus on, what to expect, and release the stress they may have (not give them the answers). This classmate took it on day 3. Now, It\u2019s important to know that they don\u2019t even use the group chat where everyone answers each other\u2019s questions. I can\u2019t remember the last time they spoke in it, so when I say they only ask me for help, I mean it. \n\nSo on the day of their test, they\u2019re texting me saying they\u2019re gonna fail and that they might need my help. Of course I reassured them, but let them know the test is proctored so they won\u2019t have their phone and I won\u2019t be able to help them. Even if they did let us have our phones I still wouldnt have helped them. During their test, I unexpectedly get a text from them FROM THEIR APPLE WATCH (another reason why I despise apple watch users). Of course it\u2019s a picture of a test question (a pretty easy one) that happened to be the exact same question our professor went over in the test review on Zoom (which they said they attended). \n\nI completely ignored them because I reached a boiling point. No way should they think I\u2019ll supply them with answers while they dont do the work on their own. I\u2019ve taken time out of my day to give them 90% of the answers to an online homework assignment (it had 40 or more questions). By the week of the test, I thought they would\u2019ve known the material by now. We\u2019re all learning the same thing and I shouldnt be burdened with learning it myself while someone nags me for the answers I\u2019ve found, especially not on a test.\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1675982417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y8lk5/aita_for_ignoring_a_classmate_who_constantly_asks/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Providing answers to a test could get you expelled. As for helping them out, you went above and beyond.

It's important to learn to say no, otherwise you'll end up wasting a lot of time and effort on something that is ultimately not your problem.", "NTA They're taking you for granted. You shouldn't be fixing their problems for them. If they're so concerned about failing they need to take matters into their own hands and actually try to make an effort in participating more in study sessions and asking the professors for help when they offer sessions.", "NTA. You should have cut this person off sooner. They can pay someone to help them master material & even cheat on tests. If they got caught cheating with your help, *both of you* could have been expelled. This person doesn't belong at college.", "You did the right thing by ignoring them. Cheating undermines the value of the degree for everyone else who does things the right way. It\u2019s one thing to offer to help an acquaintance, though you don\u2019t even have a duty to do that especially when they\u2019re pestering you and using you as a crutch instead of trying to learn the material, but I\u2019d argue you DO have a duty to ignore them if they do that on a test.

I think you drew the line rather well.", "NTA. \n\nBut you need to report them for cheating. Your not tutoring them when your giving them the answers to homework, or now tests. Its one thing to explain a question to them but what is happening is they just want you to do their work for them. \n\nYou need to report them for cheating. Or they will find a way to bring you down when they get caught for cheating or when they fail.", "Info. \n\nHow did you know the text came from the Apple Watch?

They are literally asking you a cheap for them don\u2019t do it and honestly I wouldn\u2019t do it in general unless they\u2019re willing to pay you for it unless they want to pay for your tutoring it\u2019s their problem . Personally, I would start keeping her distance from this person.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they hid their phone though.", "That's the beauty of the offer of paid tutoring. They will never pay for something they feel entitled to, so by offering tutoring for money you not only get them off your back, you teach them that nothing in life is free.", "I just didn\u2019t think they would actually use it", "You said in another comment that they told you they used their watch which is impossible.", "> somehow they took a picture of a problem and sent it.\n\nWith a phone.", "The off chance that the cheater is willing to pay whatever for help cheating, means they just need to write off this person. I'd think about reporting them if I were in OP's shoes.", "They told me they had the watch before they began taking their exam. From then on, I don\u2019t know what happened between them or the proctor when they arrived to take the test. They could\u2019ve handed their phone over and kept the watch, or lied and said they didn\u2019t have their phone on them (the proctors still let us keep our belongings under the desk we sat at, don\u2019t even ask me why)."]}
