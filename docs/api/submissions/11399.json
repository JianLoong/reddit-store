I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nIt's disgusting that we still live in a global culture where girls and women are diminished and disrespected for the accident of birth, even where we're nominally equal.", "YTA but not because you told off your entitled uncle. It's because your grandma specifically wanted you to have something of hers and you handed it over to some a-holes who will just sell it off.
