They kept arguing and kept going and just belittling us. I just kept quiet and sat there , listening to them call us unworthy little brats because we dont share the same last name. I got angrier each time so I slammed the gold jewellery on the table , said \"take it then\" and walked out the house. \n\nLet me be clear , i dont care or did not argue about the part of the will not because its not much or because i wasnt grateful. Its more about i wasnt about to let them treat my dead grandma as a money making machine and argue about how they cant sell or get more from my grandma. Im grateful but i love my grandma for my grandma and not for the things she left me. I would keep them but if they want it so much so they can sell and be assholes. So be it.\n\nI got calls and text messages calling me disrespectful and rude from my second uncle and his children.

The only thing I'd say is you shouldn't have given in and challenged him...", "NTA get out the big spoon and stir. The most blatant painful experiences I have had with family members have been surrounding someone\u2019s passing and greed, like I cannot even describe, shame on them.", "NTA. In Chinese culture, absolutely it was wrong. There is a way of doing things culturally and you should know better then to make a scene like that. You're not the asshole for being upset about what was taking place in front of you.\n\nThat being said, I dont agree with the hierarchical system with elders being \"respected\" without question. I think the most messed up thing that can and usually happens after an elder passes is the kids fighting over what was left behind. I would have done the same thing. I grew up in North America and am pretty disconnected to the \"Chinese\" way of doing things.", "NTA.  You can tell them that it's disrespectful to the deceased memory and to the elders to act like vultures.  It's understandable that you got upset by your uncles hideous reaction.  Unless your uncle has proof that you influenced your grandma, then he is the AH here.", "I assume that your gradma drafted her will. It was her decisiom to give you just as much as for her despite of the culture you were worth just as much. You should not have left it behind, and you should hold on to it preciously. \n\n\nHowever you were not wrong about what you said, and their level of entitlement, regardless of culture, is not acceptable. \n\nINFO: Were your parents around and if yes what was their reaction?", "YTA to yourself you should have kept the jewelry!!", "Nta- i'm sorry your family are hyenas", "Info wanted, because I\u2019m curious: did they *take* the jewelry?", "NTA.

And she wanted you to have those things anyways. That means something. You were clearly special to her.\n\nHonour your grandma. Get what was willed to you by her, take it unapologetically, and if your uncle has a problem he can reflect on why he thinks his children are god\u2019s fucking gift just because they have a penis and leave you the heck alone. I know that is easy for me to say and not as easily done. But it seems like your grandma truly wanted you to have these things and if your uncle brings it up again, ask him very calmly and politely if HE is disrespecting your grandma (aka his elder) and suggesting she didn\u2019t know what she was doing when she made her own will.\n\nThat should hopefully shut him up.", "NTA.  \n\n\nAre you in China?\n\nIf you are in China, you were rude and disrespectful towards the family and elders.

I didnt care about thw will or what she left me. i know she just wanted to be fair to all the grandchildren. i rlly am grateful for it.
