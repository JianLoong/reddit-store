Too much", "She could! But firstly, three in a bed is uncomfortable, and they stay up later. Plus I know when my husbands friends visit, I want them to have their own little space (and I have my own space!!) I really really like his friends, but they have their own relationship and inside jokes and don\u2019t want the friend to have to do the whole \u201cso, BillyYumYum, how\u2019s work going?\u201d \u201cHow are you liking the new place?\u201d \u201cAny fun trips?\u201d I save those talks for dinner/earlier in the evening and let them have their bonding time together at night. (And yes, most of his friends are straight women or gay men, it makes no difference to me).", "Not if her girlfriend's friend is not close to OP. That would be awkward. Especially when the girlfriend and her friend want to talk. \n\nWomen like to talk about their relationships with their close friends, with OP right there that would not be possible.", "Not if her girlfriend's friend is not close to OP. That would be awkward. Especially when the girlfriend and her friend want to talk. \n\nWomen like to talk about their relationships with their close friends, with OP right there that would not be possible.", "They probably do only have one couch, given that OP described her place as being a tiny flat.", "I have a feeling \u201cnot caring\u201d isn\u2019t the only reason those two women want to share a bed\u2026", "Commenter edited the comment after being corrected, they\u2019re not referring to \u201chusband\u201d, the wrong pronouns were used and then fixed.", "That\u2019s actually kinda weird ngl, who knows what\u2019s going on in there lol. Imagine if OP has a husband who had a female best friend who were sleeping together while OP was sleeping on the sofa \ud83d\ude02", "Commenter edited pronouns after replier corrected them. They said \"he\" instead of \"she\" originally when referring to OP.", "All players in this story are women, two of whom in a relationship with each other, and one of whom we have no idea about their sexual orientation. I'm not sure if we're crying wolf, but let's say that if they had nothing to hide, they'd be okay to have their sleepover in the living room while OP sleeps properly in her own bed.\n\nSo yeah, this \ud83d\ude07", "But *why* is it weird? \n\nAnd what about different beds in the same hotel room? Or sharing a tent while camping?", "Maybe they swiped \u201csadistic\u201d lol", "*six nights in a row*", "That's fair, I just meant in general", "Why can't it be like that tho? \n\nImo, nothing inherently wrong with platonic adult friends sharing a bed.\n\nThe problem is kicking OP out of their bed to do it. Should be a guest bed or a temporary bed out in the common area", "People are stupid, you\u2019d be surprised.", "The red flag is she\u2019s being kicked out of her own bed, OP and her GF should be in the bed together, friend should be the one on the sofa. Nobody said \u201coh hurr durr gay people can\u2019t have loyal relationships\u201d, this would still be a red flag if it were a straight couple and you know it. I wouldn\u2019t kick my partner out of my bed because I have a friend over, that\u2019d be weird. Get off the high horse, there\u2019s nothing homophobic about this raising some eyebrows especially when it\u2019s for 6 whole days.", "There\u2019s definitely not enough to say if she were cheating and it would be definitively jumping to conclusions by claiming she were, but the fact she\u2019s in a bed for 6 nights with the sex she\u2019s attracted to while her girlfriend (OP) is booted to the couch is eyebrow raising and would be a little concerning in any relationship, to ignore it and claim it\u2019s not weird would be weird.", "I doubt they'd be able to do much hiding while the partner is still in the same very small flat, even if she's in the next room.\n\nEspecially if they keep the door open? OP doesn't say if the door is open or shut at night.", "Its suspicious, you dont kick your SO out of the bed to share it with someone else, its very possible cheating is going on and at bare minimum is a massive red flag.", "You don\u2019t kick your significant other out for 6 days just to relive your sleep over days. That *is* weird, period, end of story.", "And that\u2019s why it\u2019s ridiculous to kick the SO to the couch. I\u2019m just saying me personally, I have no issue with six nights of a friend being over as long as I have my own space. Especially if I have to get up early and they\u2019ll be up late, I don\u2019t want my sleep interrupted by someone coming to bed at 2a. The bigger issue here (again, for me personally) is that OP doesn\u2019t have her own space and bed. I don\u2019t put my stock into sharing a bed with my SO, it\u2019s not a romantic or sexual thing at all for me. It\u2019s purely about getting a good night of sleep.", "I agree there's nothing wrong with sleepovers and platonic bed sharing. Kicking OP out of her own bed is quite unfair, though.", "OP doesn't even mention if the door is kept shut.\n\nI would indeed be very surprised if someone is kicking their partner out of their own bed to cheat on them with someone else while the partner is still present in the same tiny flat. *Especially* if the door is open.", "I'd still not consider a straight woman with a friend who was a man doing this to automatically be cheating, either.\nYall are so fixated on promiscuity for absolutely zero reason, it's weird. People can be purely platonic friends and still make awful moves against their (friends) spouses without stickin' it in one another.", "1. we don\u2019t know the size of the residence as far as I can tell. \n2. You say there\u2019s no mention of the door being kept closed, but there\u2019s also no mention of the door being kept open either.\n3. Not claiming her partner is cheating, just that it\u2019s an odd set of events that are a bit flagish and odd behavior.\n4. This is for the sake of devils advocate, even if she were cheating (not saying she is as there\u2019s nowhere near enough proof to make a claim like that.) you can still be intimate w/o having sex.", "I think it's inconsiderate to kick OP out of her own bed, yes. But I don't think it's inherently sexual or a red flag.\n\nIf I wanted to cheat on my partner, I wouldn't do so in their own bed while they were in the next room of a \"very small\" flat. \n\nI wonder if the bedroom door is open or shut at night? OP doesn't say.", "I agree that you shouldn't do that, but because it's unfair and rude.\n\nPlatonic bed sharing still isn't weird, though.", "You made your point well,  I don't know why people are struggling with it lmao", "Yeah absolutely. For 6 days too??", "You would be surprised how many people get turned on by shit like that\u2026 makes it more exciting i suppose", "If you can\u2019t see anything wrong with this then you\u2019re likely one of those people who fall for the \u201cyou just won \u00a31,000,000 click this totally not phishing link to claim\u201d scam emails.", "Eh\u2026 maybe I\u2019m black pilled but I think most people would cheat, given the opportunity. So yes, I would be concerned if my partner would share a bed with someone of the sex she is attracted towards for multiple nights in a row\u2026 despite the fact that this friend could just take the couch instead. Pretty weird in my eyes", "OP literally describes their residence in her post as a very small flat.", "Except that isn\u2019t the case here, what is weird is she\u2019s kicking out her GF out her bed for her friend\u2026.she\u2019s cheating on her in plain sight.", "Sounds like you are projecting because that's what you would do in a similar situation. I've shared beds with people of both sexes and never been tempted to cheat when I was a relationship and never been tempted to make more of the situation than getting a good night's sleep when I was single.", "I don't know what black pilled is, but I'm genuinely sorry whatever it means seems to have you automatically distrusting the (hypothetical) person you've chosen to share your life with.", "All people have the opportunity to cheat, it's not hard at all. And most people don't", "The definition of small changes depending on where you live, if you\u2019re in London small can be considered like a Studio flat or if you\u2019re in a cheaper place to live like over in Cardiff or something it could be a 2 bed 1 bath flat. Again, we have a best guesstimate on the range of size but we don\u2019t know how small the place actually is.", ">hurr durr projecting\n\nThat\u2019s some serious mental gymnastics you\u2019re making over there mate. This isn\u2019t a one off incident in OP\u2019s case and this is for nearly a week, if that\u2019s not even a bit of an eyebrow raiser then I\u2019m genuinely concerned for you.", "Im not automatically distrusting anyone. I\u2019m not saying that most people go out of their way to cheat, what I think is that most people would cheat under the right circumstances. And an example could be sleeping in a bed with someone while being mutually attracted towards each other. People are already plenty stupid but when we are horny ? Multiply the issue. \n\nSo it\u2019s not necessarily an issue of trust, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m aware people aren\u2019t perfect and don\u2019t always act rationally. Especially when they are horny.", "You'll pull a muscle if you keep reaching."]}
