Also just to be clear no nta.", "NTA you are working. You need a good nights sleep.", "Nta. Offering for a night or two is being a good host. Her taking your bed for a week os being a bad guest. But its not really the friend's fault because its your GF's place too and she is  a tivley requesruon you get this treatment. Your GF either isn't thinking of your needs, or is placing her wants above them. \n\nIs there a reason they can't both sleep in the in the living room? Or stay up qell past you and have the GF just come to bed late?", "Interesting that only one other person commenting here even seemed to entertain the thought that they might have an open relationship, and that the GF sleeping with someone else might not be cheating.\n\nI usually sleep in the guest room if my husband is having sex with someone else when I want to go to sleep. But if it were for a lot of nights in a row, I'd eventually want to return to a more normal sleeping situation and have my husband back. But if I told my husband my back hurt, or if I had to go to work, he wouldn't accept me sleeping somewhere uncomfortable.\n\nRegardless, I'm not sure the question was about whether anyone's snogging in there, it's about the OP sleeping on a couch all the time to make room for guests in the bed, and whether she's being TA by drawing a boundary.\n\nOf course if they are supposed to be monogamous, and GF is indeed getting it on in there, I suspect there will be a more important boundary at issue.\n\nBut again, NTA. OP should have precedence in her own bedroom, in her own home, over guests. It's nice of her to have been hospitable so far, but it's okay for her to say enough is enough.", "Your gf is being outrageous.\n\nShe can set up with her friend in the living room if she wants more time with her.\n\nHonestly, a normal caring partner wouldn\u2019t dream of asking this.  Surely you\u2019re re-thinking this person\u2019s place in your life?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nand honestly, I'd keep the bed all to myself if my partner suggests I sleep on the couch so the two of them can have the bed. And this would be something to decide the future of the relationship, it's either your health that your GF now prioritieses and you get the bed or her best friend, which means you'll always be second fiddle at best.", "NTA.\n\nBut... Air Mattress anyone? ????", "NTA but are you sure she is just sleeping in there with them? Seems weird that she kicks her gf to the couch instead of them hanging on the couch, and your gf coming to bed when they go to sleep.  \n\nBut that might be my trauma talking.", "NTA. They can fornecate when you're at work instead of when you're on the couch.", "Your gf could be the dutiful host and give up her own bed.\n\nWhy isn't your gf just asking you to sleep with her?", "NTA", "Wait so you sleep in the common area designated to hang out with people \u2026. And they get the bed\u2026:. \n\n\nWhat is wrong with the logic in this picture\u2026.\n\nTo me it feels so wrong \u2026 and for me it would not last long this relationship because I\u2019m sleeping in my bed that\u2019s it. It\u2019s weird to want to wake up next to friends\u2026.", "There are some really comfortable air mattresses that can go in the living area so they can stay up late and catch up and be comfortable when sleeping\u2026 and you can get down and up when you need to. Win win. It doesn\u2019t need to be either or\u2026 them be comfortable and you un, or Vice versa.  NTA.", "NTA. She can sleep in the living room with her friend if she's that desperate for social time. Asking you to sleep on the sofa at all makes her an asshole.", "NTA but you haven't really explained why she would be able to spend more time with her friend if you slept on the couch. If you sleep in your bedroom, then that means the living room is free for them to hang out in, right? It has a couch to sit on and probably a TV for them to watch.", "NTA at all\n\nNow it's different it's like a night after not seeing each other for a longtime but 6 nights??? Tbh even if it was after a longtime, she's an AH for asking you to sleep on the couch on workdays. Does she even like you?", "Really don't understand this...why can't your gf and her friend stay in lounge area to chat leaving you free to go to bed? Is your gf and her friend really spending all their time in the bed? If so I would really start to question what is going on!  No you're NTA.", "Nah, nta. That\u2019s an unrealistic way of life she wants you to live, couches are the worst, and you\u2019re tall. My boyfriend is tall, and he would never be comfortable sleeping like that. I\u2019m not gonna force him to stay with me if there\u2019s not room for him, not gonna force him to stay in my area ever. It\u2019s his choice ultimately", "My grandmother taught me never to give up my bed for anyone. \n\nNTA.", "Actually reading through the post and some of the comments I've got to ask...is your gf 12 ? Only explanation I can think of for this childish behaviour", "Oh my goodness NTA, go reclaim your bed!!", "Red flag!!!! You\u2019re NTA", "NTA these ppl aren't paying rent and its weird that theyd even be ok with taking your bed. I cant imagine being a guest in someone elses home and forcing them ro sleep on the couch while i sleep on the bed. Your gf should bring some blankets out to the living room and have their little sleepover out there if shes that determined to spend every second w her friends.", "NTA at all. No matter what the situation was, I wouldn\u2019t find it okay to kick my partner out of the bed for someone else. That\u2019s just weird that she feels the need to sleep in the same bed with her friend so much so that she kicks you out of the room. It\u2019s honestly giving the vibe that she\u2019s cheating on you, can\u2019t think of any other reason why she would absolutely NEED to sleep in the same bed with her \u201cfriend\u201d and kick you onto the couch.", "NTA but also don\u2019t let these weirdos commenting make you think it\u2019s something it\u2019s not. She\u2019s young and still very much in the \u201cslumber party\u201d mindset. But you two live together now and it\u2019s time for her to grow up with her living conditions. Talk it out, make it clear it won\u2019t wake you up for her to come to bed whenever; or if she still wants it to be a \u201cslumber party\u201d they can do it the old fashioned way by crafting a bed on the living room floor.", "NTA. You're too tall for that couch. You shouldn't have been sleeping on it in the first place. It sucks to live away from friends, but you can live a couple of months without seeing them as often so that you can afford a better sleeping arrangement. \nAs a girlfriend who loves their boyfriend, what the fuck? My boyfriend actually likes to sleep on the couch despite being too tall for it, I have no idea why. But I would never make him sleep on the couch. That's his choice. I don't know if I'd ever even ask him to.", "Is the best friend 100% straight? Because if not, that is not okay...", "I think the gender of the OP is not relevant here. I think the height of the OP and the OP being uncomfortable are very relevant!  \n\nPersonally, I can't see any logic in this for any couple. \n\nOP should never have to sleep rough in their own home.  Period.  You have already done your partner and her friend a huge favor by even doing that for a single night. Six nights is completely uncool and unacceptable. \n\nNTA.", "This. But I also want to add here that when everyone goes to sleep, it doesn\u2019t matter where they sleep. So why is OP being forced onto the couch?", "Suspicious of their motives here.", "don't even need to go so far for a hotel... they can both sleep in the living room. or at least hang out in there until OPs partner is ready to go to bed. I'm sure bestie won't die being left alone on the sofa.", "OP is female", "I think it's unreasonable to kick her out of her own bed at all, unless she herself offers to sleep on the sofa.", "I\u2019m straight and I would not be happy with this\u2026 I doubt the nature of the persons orientation makes it less weird . Why is there a need to wake up in a bed with said friend\u2026 you can talk into the wheee hours of the night on a sofa and just sleep in your own bed after\u2026 \nWhat orientation friend my husband would bring into the house the sleep as a guest their orientation doesn\u2019t change the guest title", "I mean, that's not weird for a lot of people. It's really common for girls to relive 'sleepovers' from their childhood. I know when I hang with my friends, we tend to share a bed. Then we can chat until we fall asleep.\n\nThat doesn't mean OP should have to sleep on a small sofa though and I don't agree with that. If it were me, I'd blow up an air mattress in the lounge and sleep there together, or have one person on the sofa and one on the air mattress. But there's no need to make it sound like sharing a bed with a friend is weird.", "Loving all the assumptions that GF can only be up to no good in a bed. Like my mum who thought you were having sex if you were out after 10 o'clock but it never occured to her that it was possible to have sex AND be home before 10.", "[deleted]", "I think it's cause he leaves early for work, so friend is disturbed by him when she sleeps in living room?", "Assuming couch can only fit one person, they can't. But the friend can stay on the couch and OP's gf can just come sleep with her when they are done.", "1,000 times this!", "I honestly was expecting to see like 10% of comments making the call of cheating, but 50% isn't bad at least. I see cheating from a mile on this story. Very sus indeed.", ">And does your partner often spend the night with another woman?\n\nevery other night, yes because op is also a woman.", ">It\u2019s very open-minded of you to support your girlfriend\u2019s lesbian relationship,\n\n>( **F** 24) and my girlfriend\n\nOP is already supporting her girlfriend's lesbian relationship. She's in it with her. So open-minded.", ">And I understand that she probably thinks that you offering to take the couch is like, the gentlemanly way. \n\n\nBoth women. \n\nAlso, why is it gentlemanly for anyone- male or female to sleep on their own beds?

It makes zero sense that the girlfriend wants to use the bedroom and OP has to sleep on the lounge, sounds suspicious to me...", ">( **F** 24) and my girlfriend\n\nOP is a woman.", "If it were me, I'd blow up an air mattress in the lounge and sleep there together, or have one person on the sofa and one on the air mattress. But there's no need to make it sound like sharing a bed with a friend is weird.", "I think she\u2019s being rude by kicking him out of his own bed, but nothing about that is alarming. I know tons of women who still sleep together with their best friends.", "correct. curious, are you saying this as a correction the the person you replied to? because nothing in their comment implied that op wasn't female.", "They are all women", "*her, OP is female too.", "It may not be weird for friends to share a bed, but it's weird to kick your significant other out of bed to share it with another person.", "Sure, but would you kick your SO out of your shared bed for *6 nights in a row* just to relive girls sleepovers?", "It's not weird per se, and ime it's kinda common for lgbtq ppl to have social relationships where this type of friendship intimacy happens....but it's not *weird* that the friends share a bed, it's *suspect* when one or more parties sharing the bed are wlw and her girlfriend has to physically leave the room so bestie can overnight in bed...", "It sounds immature more than sexual to me - like she's still treating it like a teenage sleepover.\n\nThe weirdest thing that's going on in that bedroom is probably them messing around with a ouija board or sneaking sips of wine.", "But then the gf could je there to", "OP is also a woman.", "She.

My point still stands. Change \u201cgentlemanly\u201d to \u201cproper\u201d or really any other word you want. Assuming nothing more is going on, the girlfriend probably thinks this is the right thing to do when having guests. It\u2019s possible she grew up in a household that taught her to ALWAYS accommodate your guests \u2014 no matter what. My family was like this. And they definitely would\u2019ve given up their bed for the couch for guests. Insane, I know. Thankfully we aren\u2019t like that in our home. We have an air mattress, a good one, that automatically gets set up in the living room. That\u2019s where all guests sleep. If I really want to sleep next to my friend, I\u2019ll join them on the air mattress. If for some reason the air mattress isn\u2019t good enough for said guest (for example, when mother comes) then I will join my partner on the air mattress! I would never displace them without discussing it with them first. And if OP\u2019s girlfriend is really expecting that, then she should expect a conversation to be had first.
