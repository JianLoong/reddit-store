If she's not up for that then I don't think it's about spending time together", "NTA. They can always get a hotel or whatever and chat all night if they want, but your bed is your bed.

They could camp out in the living room or other room if they really wanted to", "Considering your height and size of couch, doesn't seem like she is considerate enough to think of your wellbeing, as your partner. Also strange that she insists they \"spend more time\" in bed, instead of them being on the couch instead. Maybe one or couple of nights as a \"sleepover\" but days on end when it's your bed too?
