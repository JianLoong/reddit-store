I have a pretty extensive knife collection that has cost me several thousand dollars over the course of my career. I keep my knives at home on a knife magnet in my kitchen. My boyfriend never cooks and so he never touches my knives but just in case he ever decides to cook I made sure to teach him proper knife etiquette. I explained why it is awful to run a knife through the dishwasher (ruins the blade, ruins the handle, stuff like that) I explained that you never use my knives to open a bag of something or scrape off a cutting board, etc. my bf is prone to forgetting things so I made it a point to drill it into his head. It was talked about so often that my bf started making jokes and pretended to put my knife in the dishwasher and would laugh and take it out. Well, I get home from work today and I go to unload the dishwasher and I see my favorite chef knife in the dishwasher. I pull it out, notice a chip in the tip, and go to my boyfriend and ask him why he put my knife in the dishwasher and I said you\u2019ve caused the tip to chip. He said \u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot\u201d and I said you need to be more conscious of what you\u2019re doing because I am tired of everything I say to you getting overlooked and forgotten. He didn\u2019t say anything else and I walked away and now he\u2019s saying stuff to me like \u201ceverything I do isn\u2019t enough\u201d and \u201cI feel like I\u2019m constantly letting you down\u201d and now I feel like I\u2019ve gone too far. AITA?\n\nEDIT: a lot of people have been saying to just put a cheap set in my kitchen, but my boyfriend seriously doesn\u2019t cook like I mean genuinely cooks nothing that requires a knife. He uses the air fryer and oven to cook pizza and that\u2019s genuinely it.

He knows he was wrong and that you had every right to be pissed. Now, he's creating a situation where you feel like you were overreacting and that you need to apologize for criticizing him. He wants deflect attention from his failure to listen to you and causing damage to the knife and he wants you to make *him* feel better. This is a pretty classic red flag. Are there others? \n\nNTA.

It doesn't even sound like he apologised.", "NTA - he\u2019ll never make this mistake again if he has to pay to replace the knife he ruined.", "NTA. Professional quality knives are very expensive, and you've told him they need to be hand washed. Apparently he thought you were being too fussy and that washing them in the DW would't hurt. This isn't about \"everything \\[he\\] does.\" That's [ridiculous. It](https://ridiculous.It)'s about him not respecting your professional opinion. Lock up your professional grade knives and buy him some cheap knives.", "NTA\n\nHe also needs to buy you a new knife. A few hundred bucks out of his pocket should be a good enough reminder for next time he thinks he can just quickly run them through the washer and you won't notice.", "NTA. This is a wholly legitimate reason to be upset. In regards to him saying \u201cI feel like I\u2019m constantly letting you down,\u201d there are two possibilities: either he's deliberately exaggerating the situation in order to manipulate you, which is a MAJOR red flag; or else he is, in fact, constantly letting you down, which seems like a fairly major compatibility issue. I don't envy your position in either case, but I wish you the best with it.", "NTA\n\ndon't let him skip being accountable...you are not saying nothing is good enough...you are very reasonably complaining that this is not good enough.\n\nHe is trying to do the all or nothing thing...muddy the water of a real complaint by saying it negates everything else ij the whole universe.", "NTA. It won't get better, I'm sorry to say. Some ppl are not not cognizant of these things.\n\nSidenote- it's okay to use the back of the knife to push things off a cutting board into the pot, right? Not the sharp blade side but the dull side. Or am I doing that wrong????", "NTA. Those are the tools of your trade! As your boyfriend, he should realize how important they are to you and treat them properly as you asked. I love to cook but I'm not a professional chef and only have a moderately priced knife set and I'd still be upset if my wife put them through the dishwasher! But she doesn't because, like you, I made it clear to her that they are hand-wash only.

He is turning this around on you. Does he ise this tactic often? Your anger is his fault due to his actions,  not your fault.", "NTA. That\u2019s like saying I forgot to brake before hitting a car.

The language being used is more parent/child appropriate than partner-partner, and even viewed through the parent/child lens it's not healthy to talk in absolutes.  \n\n\nYou're not happy in this relationship - that's obvious, and from the sounds of it neither is he.  \nCounselling may be required if you wish to save this relationship.

He should buy his own set of knives and leave yours alone, even if you have to wash them yourself.", "NTA it's called weaponised incompetence", "NTA I feel like this is a major step to ending the relationship though based on your feelings about his past behaviors.", "NTA It wasn't too much of you to ask him to remember how to properly care for your knives. The fact that he's being passive aggressive instead of just taking accountability and apologizing, and maybe offering to get you a new knife, shows an extreme lack of emotional maturity.", "Nta.\n\nI\u2019m a chef and I\u2019m very picky about everything in the kitchen! Because of that tho, I keep my favorite knives away from the kitchen. Everyone else can use cheap knives because I\u2019m the only one allowed to even touch them. It doesn\u2019t sound like he apologized but instead tried to self pity himself to make you feel bad for saying something about the knives.", "NTA Are you planning on asking him to help in replacing the knife? He is kinda the A in this situation, as it takes effort to load the knife properly in a dishwasher, more effort than just cleaning it and putting it back in the block or drawer", "NTA, that's really messed up and he owes you a lot more than an apology, an \"I forgot\" and some manipulative whining\n\nI think he's proven you can't trust him, kinda ridiculous situation if you have to actually lock your knives away from him because he doesn't respect you/care", "NTA.  How does this one thing get drawn into \"everything\".", "NTA \n\nHe flat out doesn't respect you, your professional opinions and makes jokes about what's important to you. He sounds very immature, to say the least. I don't know if you love him enough to overlook all of that but I would seriously have a talk with him to try and find out why he doesn't care about your things. Maybe it's time to cut him loose. Pun intended!\n\nEDIT:  Regarding your edit, OP:  I highly recommend you DON'T \"put a cheap set of knives\" in your kitchen instead of your prized, expensive professional ones. Secondly , something tells me he was upset with you about something and put your knife in there on purpose then played dumb.", "NTA\nYour BF should get nothing but gruel until he respects your work tools", "NTA. I\u2019m a dude and if anybody puts my knives in the dishwasher I\u2019ll fuck \u2018em up.

Is a break down of communication!\"", "NTA - the petty in me says that instead of buying him something he wants for Christmas, buy him a set of shitty knives that are his to use instead of touching your good ones. Lol", "NTA if you wreck something you have to replace it. If you can\u2019t afford to risk it don\u2019t use it! He could buy cheap knives and wash them however he wants. I know this about myself, so it\u2019s not a dig at him. It\u2019s less stressful for me if I don\u2019t feel like a mistake will be the end of the world.", "NTA and the guilt trip he is trying to pull is manipulative to make you feel bad for enforcing a boundary. He needs to knock that off immediately. Apologize and take responsibility for what he did because he definitely knew what your boundary was or else he is an absolute moron.", "NTA\n\nHe damaged something of yours, after numerous times of intentionally acting like he was going to damage it. Then started whining to get you to comfort him about it. Saying \"I'm sorry\" as an apology is lame when 5 yo do it, his grown ass should do world's better. He can start with replacing the knife and deep cleaning the bathroom since he can't be trusted in the kitchen.", "NTA, but you knew that. Him playing the victim card is a bit low. Maybe time to trade him in for a newer model with more memory.", "I feel like he tipped it and then put it in the dishwasher to cover it up, and if that handle seems the least bit loose or any other damage which we all know can come of it I\u2019d be having him replace it, nta. Signed a fellow chef.", "You do sound a wee bit annoying about \"drilling\" the rules info him, but frankly, I get it. I have family who are chefs, and I myself have a few nice knives and, admittedly, I do always make a point of telling anyone who might cook in my house the terms in which they can use them (no opening bags, etc). I also make a point of ensuring we all have \"regular use\" knives everyone can use or abuse without reproach as is convenient, and keep my nice knives out of sight (not locked away, but less likely to be randomly grabbed).\n\n*All that said.* \n\nHe may very well have truly forgotten. Being told things a bunch of times doesn't cement learning and understanding. In this case, I'd say he should pay to have the knife repaired or replaced and that can be the learning experience for him.\n\nHe may have also not forgotten, and this may have been some stupid jab at how you've made a point of how special these knives are (because, well, they are). If that's the case, this is a whole other can of worms.\n\nI'm not qualified to speak on which case this is, but I see these options as the most likely ones.\n\nEither way, you are NTA.", "Info: does he have ADD/ADHD? This smells like the kind of quirk that comes with those types of  diagnoses. \n\nI feel like he's either in need of developing better coping skills for a neurodivergence, or he's a manipulative jerk who is using weaponized incompetence to get out of chores. \n\nOP, which thing seems more likely to you? \n\nEither way NTA", "NTA but why are y\u2019all both being over dramatic \u201cyou never listen to me\u201d \u201ceverything I do is never enough for you\u201d \n\n\nY\u2019all need therapy lmfao", "I think a new boyfriend is in order", "ESH.

But be careful with the language you use...\n\n>because I am tired of \"everything\" I say to you getting overlooked and forgotten\n\nIs it \"everything\" you say or is it just this one thing? \n\nThats why your partner things \"everything\" he does isn't enough. \n\nHe made a mistake, let him apologize and move on. Wash your own knives and don't let him use them in future.", "NAH. But, people forget things and sometimes expensive stuff gets damaged.", "I get taking care of knives, especially expensive ones. Based on your post, it sounds like you went above and beyond to make it clear that you value the knives.\n\nHis reaction makes me think he is just pouting, but can i ask if you have to remind him about things like this all the time? I hate to stereotype my kind, but dudes can be forgetful. That doesn't excuse the behavior, but in relationships sometimes things that are stated (even repeatedly) go in one ear and out the other. \n\nI am saying NTA, and depending on how often you have to remind him of things (and depending on what those things are) it may warrant a discussion to make sure he is mindful of listening to instructions. He is an adult after all.  \n\nOne thing that comes to mind is if you nag (or he feels like you do even if you don't), may be one reason why he forgets. He might just check out and even though he knows it is something you have gone over before, his brain is just somewhere else.

If you got angry with them, they would either get angry back at you, or turn themselves into the victim.", "Yeah he's playing victim at this point.", "This. Plus the constant lies 'I forgot'.. come on, OP, your BF isn't 5 any more...", ">Are there others?\n\nThe constant forgetting things seems intentional. And her bf joked about putting the knives into the dishwasher and then does exactly that a few days later. That's not \"oopsie I forgot\". He did it intentionally to piss off op and now he's playing victim.", "This. Cant believe I had to scroll so far down.

A few months later, she was cheating.", "Your feeling is in this case fact. You said it yourself: he only forgets what is inconvenient to him.\n\nThe evidence is he doesn't CARE that much about these things, and the fact that they are important to you is less important to him than his personal convenience.", "He used the knife as a tool or hit something with it. \nA dishwasher is not as abrasive.", "Seems like the point is that he keeps doing it and then just expects a \"sorry\" to be enough.

My partner had *no idea* that you shouldn't put the good knives in the dishwasher, but were adamant that the good silverware (think wedding / ancestral silver) should only be hand washed and laid out to dry.  Since we've moved in together, they no longer put the good knives in the dishwasher, though they are bad about washing them at all (I'll often find one laying around up to a day later that was used to cut cheese or lunch meat or fruit, for example); luckily, there's been minimal damage to the blades as a result of that.  Since I do almost all the cooking, I keep them in good condition, and hand wash each of them once I'm done with them and put them back in the block to dry.   If someone had been negligent with one of my knives, to the point of actual damage like a chip in it, I'd be pretty livid.\n\nThe reason he's saying he's constantly letting you down is because, well, he is letting you down, by not paying attention to what you actually say, and actually want, instead of what he'd do if on his own with his own stuff.", "> a lot of people have been saying to just put a cheap set in my kitchen\n\nLOL why are there always a bunch of comments saying \"why don't you give up the things you love so some idiot doesn't feel bad\"?", "Two words\n\nWeaponized incompetence", "YTA and stop dating someone with ADHD.", "NTA,\n\nI grew up knowing this about knives and have grilled both this subject into my roommate's minds as well as never to leave them in the sink.", "NTA.

It wasn't because he was biologically wired differently, he just grew up with the expectation to do it. So do you know what I did? I looked for a partner that was capable of doing the same house chores that I do.", "Yea this is exactly how I am.

OP could have been the one who dropped it, but doesn't want to lose face by admitting a wonder chef could do such a thing.  With hours and hours of lecturing him about proper care, it's seems that this guy would have avoided breathing on these knives.

It will dry out and damage the handle.  It can add to dulling of the blade.  It can do lots of things.  But it won't cause a chip in a well forged steel blade.

If it did, then there is something either defective in the blade to begin with OR she chipped it herself and is trying to blame him!  Expensive and well made knives of this type are meant to withstand run-ins with BONE if need be, yet hers chipped in a run through the dishwasher?
