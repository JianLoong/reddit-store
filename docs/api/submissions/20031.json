On that grounds,  NTA. \n\nBut one thing to consider is that your wife sees this as something that brings that pain back.  Losing a child is the hardest thing imaginable, and you and your wife are dealing with it differently.  Your way of dealing with it makes it harder for her to deal with it her way.   The way for you to resolve that starts with understanding that.", "NTA. Grieve how you need to. I would guess your wife\u2019s outburst came from her going through her own grieving process.

Your wife is TA for telling you how to grieve, only you know what you need, etc. but you are TA for blowing up on her as maybe that's something she's been telling herself to help with her grief. Id recommend going to a grief therapist (the both of you) because losing a child (even if it was only alive for 3 hours) is traumatic and can cause underlying mental health issues you may not know are there until you get triggered.\n\nedit: ETA to ESH as l didn't know the correct acronym, thanks for telling me the right one ya'll!!\nedit 2: i am in NO WAY trying to tell OP how to grieve.

You are both grieving in your own ways. \n\nI wonder if perhaps you could do a new tradition where you have a little birthday cupcake and candle that you and your wife blow out on the day (once daughter is in bed) to commentate him and visit your son on the weekend before/after. Your wife may be feeling guilt about the day not being focused on your living daughter, she may be feeling guilt that your daughter gets to celebrate the birthday and he doesn\u2019t. She may be remembering the day as a day of loss of him rather than celebration. She may just want to spend the evening with you at home remembering him rather than staring at his headstone. \n\nI don\u2019t think either are wrong but I think you both need to work on this before it tears you apart.", "NAH (for now) .  I know you're grieving and this is how you're grieving. (My condolences) .  But how long do anticipate this tradition?  Is your daughter going to forever have to either lose you for her birthday or spend her own birthday at a cemetery for someone she never knew?\n\nYou're in a terrible situation here, and I won't pretend otherwise.

You did nothing wrong by going but you each lashed out in your pain. \n\nThere\u2019s no easy answer here. Perhaps next year you could go quietly first thing in the morning, or the day before. Perhaps both of you could see a grief counselor for a few sessions. I wish both of you peace.", "Visiting the grave when no one else was inconvenienced/neglected doesn't make you the Asshole.\nShouting at her wasn't appropriate, but you've acknowledged that. \n\nCan't really say who was right/wrong in the conflict because I don't know both sides. And it doesn't really matter. \nPersonally, I'd acknowledge the mistake I made (and its impact) with an apology, without qualifying with why I did it. I like the ABC /XYZ form of conflict resolution which focuses on the behavior and how you felt, rather than the character of the other person.\nI'd bring up the topic of your lost child with her at a different time to have an open conversation about it in a similar manner. It always helps to mention what you'd like someone to do (rather than what they shouldn't), and describing why that's important to you.\nAll the best.", "NAH. I think you guys need therapy.

It's not like you're there every day and neglecting the rest of your family.\n\nMy stillborn sister (who was never alive out of the womb at all) had a cake and party every year on her birthday for almost ten years.

She is finding the way that you grieve is hurting her. She feels like you are grieving in a way that will eventually hurt your daughter. \n\nI think you should take some time to find a different way to honor your son on his birthday.

I respect your choice to visit his grave whenever you feel the need. I would never judge.  I do, however, want to say that I don't think going or not going is a measure of your level of love. It's a personal thing about grieving and loss.  I disagree with the person who said your wife doesn't love your son.  You might always want to visit on his birthday in which case it's vitally important to your marriage and your daughter for them to understand.  And on the flip side you should try to understand your wife's need to focus on pouring her efforts into your daughter who deserves to be the center of attention on her birthday.  I hope you can become closer as a result and not separate.", "NAH, im very sorry for your loss. Other commentors are correct; everyone grieves differently. If you aren't in counceling, consider it. At the very least, you both need to sit down and hash out your feelings, and hopefully come to an understanding to help you both move forward. I can't imagine what you've been through, I wish you the best.", "I gotta go with NAH. You are allowed to grieve whenever and for however long you\u2019d like. I feel like your wife may be grieving and can\u2019t handle it. She may not be able to handle the reminder every year and the thing is, your daughters birthday is also a reminder to her of the day her son was born and passed away. It\u2019s possible that visiting the grave is just to real for her. And perhaps her issue with the evenings is that by the end of the day she is distraught and she wishes you were there to help her. It\u2019s hard to say. My recommendation is you should both go to a grief counsellor if your haven\u2019t already, and/or marriage counselling. It\u2019s obviously an issue that you both need to work on. It\u2019s unfair to ask you to change your ritual, but it\u2019s also unfair to expect her to just go with it if it really bothers her. Sorry for your loss OP and good luck to you all.", "NAH\n\nThis is surely a difficult day for both of you. I can imagine she could get to a pretty dark place being on her own with your daughter in bed and you away for an hour or two at night.  And obviously visiting a loved one\u2019s grave on their birthday is completely understandable. 5 years is nothing, no amount of time will make the pain go away completely.\n\nNot sure what the solution is, you both need what you need, but it starts with some honest and compassionate communication.", "This is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. If you have not gotten therapy, you should. I had, in the course of 16 months, a NICU baby, a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and a high risk (given the last two) pregnancy and c section). We separated when my youngest was six weeks old. We divorced. We got back together after a few years. THIS. SHIT. IS. HARD. Seek counseling together and separately.", "NTA\n\nBut, can I offer a little insight perhaps on the situation.\n\nBeing a mum is hard, and birthdays are hard and busy and long. The preparation before, running everything during and then clear up after. My partner would say he\u2019s really helpful and he\u2019s present on the day, and he is, but the bulk of the mental load comes from me. \n\nHaving to do that and make the day special for my living child whilst also having to manage grief and probably guilt for not acknowledging enough my child that passed would be unbearable. I would feel guilty towards my daughter to have a \u2018slightly sad\u2019 moment on her birthday, she deserves a day of sunshine. But I\u2019d feel guilt for not giving my son the acknowledgment he deserves also. Then throw in all the other birthday stresses\u2026\n\nShe\u2019s probably jealous you get to grieve in the way she hates herself for not being able too, or because she\u2019s trying not to do it in front of your daughter. She\u2019s still going to be grieving loosing her son, and wondering what if and dealing with another year passing without her son, watching your daughter hit milestones she will never see him hit.\n\nSo, my recommendation is to find a way you can both grieve and acknowledge him as a family, without letting grief interfere with your daughters birthday. She\u2019s right in that sense, grieving the day before or after won\u2019t change much. But it might impact your daughter knowing that her special day is tarnished by grief for a sibling she barely knows.\n\nBut don\u2019t be mad at her, she\u2019s still a mama whose lost a baby, struggling with conflicting emotions and demands of motherhood at such a difficult time.", "I think there is more to this than you're admitting!", "They let you visit a graveyard at night?\n\n\nN-T-A if you are not leaving your wife with all the work and clean up.", "NTA you never get over the loss of a child.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is though.

You are NTA for visiting your son's grave. It sounds like you and your wife might benefit from talking to someone about your feelings and moving forward as your daughter gets older. It will be important for both of you to learn how to balance your grief on this day along with being present in all ways to celebrate your daughter's birthday.", "As a fellow loss parent (loss mom), you are certainly NTA. These birthdays/anniversaries never get easier. My daughter died during labor and was stillborn. Having a birthday and a death day wrapped into one is really complicated. Your complexity is tenfold because you also have a daughter to celebrate. I can only imagine the increase of stress going on for you, your wife, and probably your daughter with enough time. I agree with others that revisiting couples grief therapy would be helpful. \n\nWhat is your sons name? Happy birthday to both of your children.", "NAH but I suspect that you disappearing for nearly two hours on the day she gave birth and lost the baby has something to do with that. The child she carried for close to ten months died, all that time inside her protecting them and your son died. Maybe she wants some comfort and rest after trying to juggle the best/worst day of her life. I definitely feel like you two are in dire need of couples therapy and to not be alone when you're clearly both still mourning", "NAH. At most, you two might benefit from some therapy. Her feelings are valid, as valid as yours. Maybe she feels guilty for no longer going, maybe she's tired of mourning her son. There are a lot of reasons for her feelings and yours. I think a licensed professional who handles families and grief would be helpful. Best of luck.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong. Do you guys even talk about him, does your daughter know she had a brother? I think your wife needs counseling and maybe you two as a couple need counseling too. I lost a child, my kids all know they had an older brother. I had counseling after he passed, it's not something you forget", "NTA. My mom was an identical twin whose sister died in infancy. I don't recall how long her twin lived, but I don't believe it was for more than a few days, if a full day at all. While she/we don't make annual trips to the gravesite, my mom does go every now and then, and each time she gets pretty emotional.\n\nI am absolutely stunned by your wife's words. This was her child too, and yet she seems to be very apathetic towards her son's death, especially since the time you are taking to visit the grave isn't interfering with celebrating your living daughter. I almost wonder if she just feels it's better to forget (not a healthy approach IMO; repression of grief or guilt never works long-term) and your visits keep reminding her, so she's getting angry at you instead. She needs help.", "Hey dude. NAH. One thing that may be worth considering (just offering a different take, based purely on speculation) is that almost all women blame themselves for the loss of their child, be it early on in the pregnancy through miscarriage or later on through things like sudden infant death syndrome. So perhaps she is reading your (I think very appropriate) way of remembering your son as a deeply painful activity because she is confronted by her own perception that the death was her fault (horrid thoughts like \u2018had I been more healthy / taken more care then this would never have happened\u2019). So yes, counselling to get to the bottom of this and move forwards together", "NTA. And honestly I have a hard time saying this but your wife was way out of line with that barely lived comment. Bring his sister next time maybe the day before or after their birthday. Moving on is important but so is remembering your son. This seems like the best way to do that.", "NAH,  you are allowed to grieve the way you want and remember your son on his birthday but has your wife had any form of grief support or counciling?  \n\nmany women that experience this unfortunate situation can blame themselves.  That they were the one that was meant to keep them safe. \n\nYou need to find a healthy way to discuss how to go forward.  Find a way to both heal.", "NAH.  I don't know how to say this in a nicer way but could it be that your remembrance of your son puts you in a mood that is a downer on the celebration of your daughter?  Obviously since they were twins, and the death happened on the same day as the birth, that is going to be both a sorrowful and joyful day.  That's a rollercoaster of emotions and maybe it's making it more difficult to heal emotionally for you and/or your wife.  Could you perhaps consider going to visit your son the day before to honor his memory and spend the next day celebrating your daughter?  That separation of a few hours might just be enough to help you and your wife to get past this difficulty.", "NTA - you should be horrified by this incredibly insensitive behavior. She should be apologizing as well for attacking you for simply grieving.", "NTA. She is invalidating your feelings HARD. Also, who talks like that about their deceased child???", "NTA. OMG. I just can\u2019t imagine a mother acting that way. You did nothing wrong, in fact you did everything correctly. Your son was born, and though he only lived a short time, he made an impact. And you honored that. I\u2019d tell your wife that you aren\u2019t living in the past, but reminding yourself that life can change in a moment.

Unfortunately, I've had a few friends go through similar things (e.g. one whose daughter lived for a little over 30 hours and then passed away), and I've noticed it's very common for two parents to have different grieving styles. One wants to remember the baby, talk about him/her, use his/her name in regular conversations, etc. The other wants to forget that such a horrible thing happened. They get angry or upset if their spouse even mentions the child in passing.

Stop yelling - get therapy because you are mistreating your child when you yell in their vicinity. Yeah, you may not be yelling at them, BUT when they hear YOU yelling, it's as bad as yelling at them. \n\nWhy does she upend your child's life instead of talking it out? This introduces chaos/insecurity in your child's life, which is not a good thing. Unless what you said was extremely egregious and marriage ending, this is shaking the child's foundation, and 5 years old is sufficient to know that something happened but not sure what it is. They usually internalize it, and by the time you see the impact of your actions, it is already baked in. \n\nYou guys are a hot mess and need therapy - individually and together.", "You spend 1 to 2 hours a year honoring your dead child...and your wife's response is \"do you love our dead kid more than me????\" Huge red flags dude....

You are not wrong.\n\nBut let me present a possible counterpoint that I can imagine from having a newborn to care for while simultaneously losing a child. Your wife had to push forward no matter what and care for the child who lived. She had to be the focus, all of it, because if she fell to pieces she fails as a parent and she likely already felt like a failure as a parent because of losing the baby. That isn't true of course but it's a super common trauma reaction to miscarrying and stillbirths. What she has had to force down to stay available for your other child is unimaginable. \n\nIt's not a coincidence that this has started around the time kids are old enough for you to get a little breathing room as a parent, and also around the time your daughter is going to notice. She has a pain that she never got to process most likely, and that you mistakenly will not let her escape from because you grieve differently, and it is poisoning her memory of the child and her opinion of you because at the end of the day something can be obviously changing a year ago (when she didn't go) and yet you're completely blindsided. She is also probably afraid that this pain is going to poison her child against her birthday now that she can remember. \n\nWhy are you emotionally invested enough in your son's memory to be furious but not emotionally invested enough in your wife or daughter to be terrified at the idea that the other adult in the situation is afraid you don't love her or your living child as much as the deceased one. Why would you think going after your daughter goes to bed even answers that concern?\n\nI'll be honest with you. The preamble to your story is about \"my son, and his twin sister\". Literally all that can be gleaned about your living child from this story is she is the one who lived. \n\nTo be clear. You are not wrong in your grief. You guys need to get into therapy asap and actually work through what has apparently been unspoken and deferred for 5 years because it doesn't sound like either of you have fully processed it in a healthy way, and have even gone in opposite directions. \n\nDo you guys talk? I mean really talk.", "I think you're NTA.

It seems to me that there is something very much larger at play here. This is a family that sounds like it needs therapy. \n\nOne thing I will add, however, if the grief for the son is so overwhelming, at one point the daughter will begin to understand that. And the ghost of her brother will haunt her forever. It will damage her relationship with her father, and she may end up resenting him. \n\nI just don\u2019t think the wife would have blown up that way had OP just done this one thing.

My dad didn\u2019t know how to process it and turned to alcohol. My mom went into a deep depression and I was neglected until my mom had my sister and was able to find joy in her living. Everything I did was inexorably linked to my brother. Every milestone wasn\u2019t my own, but rather was a reminder of what my brother never got. Every mistake I made \u201cHe would never have done.\u201d I was never my own person.

You both have worked so hard and gotten SO far. \n\n\nEveryone handles grief and trauma differently. \nI hope you know you are not at all wrong to honor your son the way you do. It\u2019s as much for you as it is for him. \n\n\nI hope you and your wife can process together in therapy. You have been faced with immeasurable sadness. Owning and processing your own stuff has to come first before you can help others with theirs. I hope you are somewhere where you feel you can be there for your wife. And that she can grow to see that for what it is. \n\nAnd that you can both be on a stronger foundation for your little girl so she doesn\u2019t internalize being the reminder of negative feelings. \n\n\nOP, I really wish you and your family well.", "I was almost going to say NTA, but I changed my mind to YTA or ESH\n\n\n\" I\u2019m sick of you disappearing for hours on (my daughter\u2019s) birthday night.

But I can understand her wanting to focus on the healthy child that you DO have, and not have the day be a sad one forever.", "Everyone is allowed to grieve death in their own way.\n\nIt is reasonable that the annual date of your children's birthday is difficult for you and spending time at your son's gravesite can be helpful for you; I can also understand your wife's perspective of \"be present with your daughter and celebrate her birthday with her\". And as your daughter ages, her personal perspective will have to be factored into the family discussion.", "INFO: is this a 'stopping by for a quiet moment' or is this an all day thing?  Your wife mentioning that you disappear to hours at a time is a little concerning.  Maybe your wife would rather do something happier together to remember your son instead of just standing in a cemetery.  You both could probably benefit with counseling.", "My parents had their eldest child die at age 6 in a tragic accident. They stayed together, but they never talked about it and the ghost of my sister impacted family dynamics forever.\n\nWhile the loss of an infant is terrible, life proceeds. You, as a couple, need to find the words to communicate what you both need, what you both want, and what you can compromise on. Perhaps your wife being more pragmatic is upsetting to you. You should find some approach to grief and/or couples' counselling.\n\nDon't let this impact your daughter's happiness and growth.\n\nNAH", "You're not an arsehole but I do agree with the wife - I don't see the point of dwelling in the past. NAH.", "Yea this is the answer.  No one is the asshole, but there is a definite need for couples therapy.", "I dunno - the title \"My son\" and \"his living twin\"? They're both homebrew's kids.", "Why are you ignoring the question -asked many times- about what you said to your wife?", "He might have threatened a divorce. There\u2019s another thought I had that\u2019s a really really bad thing he could have said, but I\u2019d hate to throw it out there in case I\u2019m wrong.", "And you guess that because his wife won\u2019t open her mouth in any way but to yell at him to tell him his kid isn\u2019t real. Cause she won\u2019t communicate. But it\u2019s on him! It\u2019s his fault! He needs to read her mind! He needs to be able to know why she feels that way and he can\u2019t grieve because she might be mad! And don\u2019t forget, his kid wasn\u2019t real so it doesn\u2019t matter anyways. \n\nThey didn\u2019t understand each other because *he communicated* and she didn\u2019t. *He* did what he was supposed to and instead got yelled at that his kid wasn\u2019t real because his wife won\u2019t communicate like an adult. \n\nIt was volatile because his wife screamed at him for grieving and told him his kid wasn\u2019t real. Could you imagine if a man said that to a woman? Would you still be here standing up for that man? \n\nAnd. Again. It\u2019s **really** hard to understand a party that does nothing but scream at your for grieving and telling you your kid isn\u2019t real! But it\u2019s always the man\u2019s fault. Cause he didn\u2019t read her mind.", "Not just that, but she HAD to move on when he passed. You don't really have an option to sit there and grieve when there's a hungry baby crying. You can't fall apart when there's a baby that depends on you keeping your shit together. Realistically, she never had a chance to grieve, and this day is a very painful reminder of that.", "I think I know where you\u2019re going and yup, that would be BAD", "I really don't understand why this comment is down voted. It's a valid point. He DID spend the day celebrating the living child. He also said his wife used to come with him but chose to stop. I really don't see anything wrong here other than his wife wanting to move on and OP needing a little more time to grieve. NTA.", "Also American, big city though, definitely gates and locks on most of the cemeterys I've been to around here.", "Reddit is on crazy pills.", "Especially because it\u2019s the day his son was not only born, but died as well. Most people would think about their child or even visit the grave on those two days. Is he not supposed to acknowledge the significance of the date at all?", "A 1,2, or 3 year old isn't going to understand whats going on, and can easily sleep in a carseat or carrier. By 4 and 5 the kid is going to be more selfish about what she wants to do on her birthday, and will understand by then that her birthday makes her parents sad.", "Oh please. Just because he\u2019s a man doesn\u2019t mean he has irrational or cruel anger.", "I would have shouted pretty terrible things if my husband said to me what OP's wife said to him, and I don't think I'd feel badly about it afterwards.", "There's a jump lol", "90 minutes total for.just him. I was replying to someone who said if she wants to go, they could take turns. So that would male it 90 minutes each, consecutively, or 3 hours total."]}
