On that grounds,  NTA. \n\nBut one thing to consider is that your wife sees this as something that brings that pain back.  Losing a child is the hardest thing imaginable, and you and your wife are dealing with it differently.  Your way of dealing with it makes it harder for her to deal with it her way.   The way for you to resolve that starts with understanding that.", "NTA. Grieve how you need to. I would guess your wife\u2019s outburst came from her going through her own grieving process. But just because she wants to move on one way, doesn\u2019t mean you need to do the same. \n\nI think you should consider couples counseling with a counselor who specializes in child loss.", "NAH. There\u2019s no right or wrong way to grieve the loss of your child. Neither of you are wrong or an AH.\n\nETA.

Your wife is TA for telling you how to grieve, only you know what you need, etc. but you are TA for blowing up on her as maybe that's something she's been telling herself to help with her grief. Id recommend going to a grief therapist (the both of you) because losing a child (even if it was only alive for 3 hours) is traumatic and can cause underlying mental health issues you may not know are there until you get triggered.", "NAH everyone grieves differently.

You are both grieving in your own ways. \n\nI wonder if perhaps you could do a new tradition where you have a little birthday cupcake and candle that you and your wife blow out on the day (once daughter is in bed) to commentate him and visit your son on the weekend before/after. Your wife may be feeling guilt about the day not being focused on your living daughter, she may be feeling guilt that your daughter gets to celebrate the birthday and he doesn\u2019t. She may be remembering the day as a day of loss of him rather than celebration. She may just want to spend the evening with you at home remembering him rather than staring at his headstone. \n\nI don\u2019t think either are wrong but I think you both need to work on this before it tears you apart.", "NAH (for now) .

And it doesn't really matter. \nPersonally, I'd acknowledge the mistake I made (and its impact) with an apology, without qualifying with why I did it. I like the ABC /XYZ form of conflict resolution which focuses on the behavior and how you felt, rather than the character of the other person.\nI'd bring up the topic of your lost child with her at a different time to have an open conversation about it in a similar manner. It always helps to mention what you'd like someone to do (rather than what they shouldn't), and describing why that's important to you.\nAll the best.", "NAH. I think you guys need therapy.

Grief and loss are incredibly difficult and everyone experiences it differently.", "I am deeply sorry for the loss of your son. Did you seek therapy after your loss? I am wondering if there is a part of you that blames your daughter for the loss of your son. Eventually, if you maintain this ritual, she will notice.

It's not like you're there every day and neglecting the rest of your family.\n\nMy stillborn sister (who was never alive out of the womb at all) had a cake and party every year on her birthday for almost ten years.

I respect your choice to visit his grave whenever you feel the need. I would never judge.  I do, however, want to say that I don't think going or not going is a measure of your level of love. It's a personal thing about grieving and loss.  I disagree with the person who said your wife doesn't love your son.  You might always want to visit on his birthday in which case it's vitally important to your marriage and your daughter for them to understand.  And on the flip side you should try to understand your wife's need to focus on pouring her efforts into your daughter who deserves to be the center of attention on her birthday.  I hope you can become closer as a result and not separate.", "NAH, im very sorry for your loss. Other commentors are correct; everyone grieves differently. If you aren't in counceling, consider it. At the very least, you both need to sit down and hash out your feelings, and hopefully come to an understanding to help you both move forward. I can't imagine what you've been through, I wish you the best.", "I gotta go with NAH. You are allowed to grieve whenever and for however long you\u2019d like. I feel like your wife may be grieving and can\u2019t handle it. She may not be able to handle the reminder every year and the thing is, your daughters birthday is also a reminder to her of the day her son was born and passed away. It\u2019s possible that visiting the grave is just to real for her. And perhaps her issue with the evenings is that by the end of the day she is distraught and she wishes you were there to help her. It\u2019s hard to say. My recommendation is you should both go to a grief counsellor if your haven\u2019t already, and/or marriage counselling. It\u2019s obviously an issue that you both need to work on. It\u2019s unfair to ask you to change your ritual, but it\u2019s also unfair to expect her to just go with it if it really bothers her. Sorry for your loss OP and good luck to you all.", "NAH\n\nThis is surely a difficult day for both of you. I can imagine she could get to a pretty dark place being on her own with your daughter in bed and you away for an hour or two at night.  And obviously visiting a loved one\u2019s grave on their birthday is completely understandable. 5 years is nothing, no amount of time will make the pain go away completely.\n\nNot sure what the solution is, you both need what you need, but it starts with some honest and compassionate communication.", "This is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. If you have not gotten therapy, you should. I had, in the course of 16 months, a NICU baby, a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and a high risk (given the last two) pregnancy and c section). We separated when my youngest was six weeks old. We divorced. We got back together after a few years. THIS. SHIT. IS. HARD. Seek counseling together and separately.", "NTA\n\nBut, can I offer a little insight perhaps on the situation.\n\nBeing a mum is hard, and birthdays are hard and busy and long. The preparation before, running everything during and then clear up after. My partner would say he\u2019s really helpful and he\u2019s present on the day, and he is, but the bulk of the mental load comes from me. \n\nHaving to do that and make the day special for my living child whilst also having to manage grief and probably guilt for not acknowledging enough my child that passed would be unbearable. I would feel guilty towards my daughter to have a \u2018slightly sad\u2019 moment on her birthday, she deserves a day of sunshine. But I\u2019d feel guilt for not giving my son the acknowledgment he deserves also. Then throw in all the other birthday stresses\u2026\n\nShe\u2019s probably jealous you get to grieve in the way she hates herself for not being able too, or because she\u2019s trying not to do it in front of your daughter. She\u2019s still going to be grieving loosing her son, and wondering what if and dealing with another year passing without her son, watching your daughter hit milestones she will never see him hit.\n\nSo, my recommendation is to find a way you can both grieve and acknowledge him as a family, without letting grief interfere with your daughters birthday. She\u2019s right in that sense, grieving the day before or after won\u2019t change much. But it might impact your daughter knowing that her special day is tarnished by grief for a sibling she barely knows.\n\nBut don\u2019t be mad at her, she\u2019s still a mama whose lost a baby, struggling with conflicting emotions and demands of motherhood at such a difficult time.", "I think there is more to this than you're admitting!", "They let you visit a graveyard at night?\n\n\nN-T-A if you are not leaving your wife with all the work and clean up.", "NTA you never get over the loss of a child.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is though.

You are NTA for visiting your son's grave. It sounds like you and your wife might benefit from talking to someone about your feelings and moving forward as your daughter gets older. It will be important for both of you to learn how to balance your grief on this day along with being present in all ways to celebrate your daughter's birthday.", "As a fellow loss parent (loss mom), you are certainly NTA. These birthdays/anniversaries never get easier. My daughter died during labor and was stillborn. Having a birthday and a death day wrapped into one is really complicated. Your complexity is tenfold because you also have a daughter to celebrate. I can only imagine the increase of stress going on for you, your wife, and probably your daughter with enough time. I agree with others that revisiting couples grief therapy would be helpful. \n\nWhat is your sons name? Happy birthday to both of your children.", "NAH but I suspect that you disappearing for nearly two hours on the day she gave birth and lost the baby has something to do with that. The child she carried for close to ten months died, all that time inside her protecting them and your son died. Maybe she wants some comfort and rest after trying to juggle the best/worst day of her life. I definitely feel like you two are in dire need of couples therapy and to not be alone when you're clearly both still mourning", "NAH. At most, you two might benefit from some therapy. Her feelings are valid, as valid as yours. Maybe she feels guilty for no longer going, maybe she's tired of mourning her son. There are a lot of reasons for her feelings and yours. I think a licensed professional who handles families and grief would be helpful. Best of luck.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong. Do you guys even talk about him, does your daughter know she had a brother? I think your wife needs counseling and maybe you two as a couple need counseling too. I lost a child, my kids all know they had an older brother. I had counseling after he passed, it's not something you forget", "NTA. My mom was an identical twin whose sister died in infancy. I don't recall how long her twin lived, but I don't believe it was for more than a few days, if a full day at all. While she/we don't make annual trips to the gravesite, my mom does go every now and then, and each time she gets pretty emotional.\n\nI am absolutely stunned by your wife's words. This was her child too, and yet she seems to be very apathetic towards her son's death, especially since the time you are taking to visit the grave isn't interfering with celebrating your living daughter. I almost wonder if she just feels it's better to forget (not a healthy approach IMO; repression of grief or guilt never works long-term) and your visits keep reminding her, so she's getting angry at you instead. She needs help.", "Hey dude. NAH. One thing that may be worth considering (just offering a different take, based purely on speculation) is that almost all women blame themselves for the loss of their child, be it early on in the pregnancy through miscarriage or later on through things like sudden infant death syndrome. So perhaps she is reading your (I think very appropriate) way of remembering your son as a deeply painful activity because she is confronted by her own perception that the death was her fault (horrid thoughts like \u2018had I been more healthy / taken more care then this would never have happened\u2019). So yes, counselling to get to the bottom of this and move forwards together", "NTA. And honestly I have a hard time saying this but your wife was way out of line with that barely lived comment. Bring his sister next time maybe the day before or after their birthday. Moving on is important but so is remembering your son. This seems like the best way to do that.", "NAH,  you are allowed to grieve the way you want and remember your son on his birthday but has your wife had any form of grief support or counciling?  \n\nmany women that experience this unfortunate situation can blame themselves.  That they were the one that was meant to keep them safe. \n\nYou need to find a healthy way to discuss how to go forward.  Find a way to both heal.", "NAH.  I don't know how to say this in a nicer way but could it be that your remembrance of your son puts you in a mood that is a downer on the celebration of your daughter?  Obviously since they were twins, and the death happened on the same day as the birth, that is going to be both a sorrowful and joyful day.  That's a rollercoaster of emotions and maybe it's making it more difficult to heal emotionally for you and/or your wife.  Could you perhaps consider going to visit your son the day before to honor his memory and spend the next day celebrating your daughter?  That separation of a few hours might just be enough to help you and your wife to get past this difficulty.", "NTA - you should be horrified by this incredibly insensitive behavior. She should be apologizing as well for attacking you for simply grieving.", "NTA. She is invalidating your feelings HARD. Also, who talks like that about their deceased child???", "NTA. OMG. I just can\u2019t imagine a mother acting that way. You did nothing wrong, in fact you did everything correctly. Your son was born, and though he only lived a short time, he made an impact. And you honored that. I\u2019d tell your wife that you aren\u2019t living in the past, but reminding yourself that life can change in a moment. You appreciate what you have and its fragility by visiting your son every year. It\u2019s what helps you fight to keep your daughter safe and loved. Why is she so angry that someone she helped create, even though here for such a short time, has taught you about yourself and your responsibility to your family? If it bothers her that it detracts from your daughter, then go the day before or the day after the birthday.", "NTA. Please respect yourself enough not to grovel and apologize to your sociopathic wife for daring to have basic human emotions.", "NTA", "NTA In any way, shape, or form! It doesn't matter how long he lived. You are still grieving. You might always grieve. We all handle the passing of our loved ones in different ways. There is no right or wrong to this. How your wife confronted you was just horrible. Sorry for your loss no matter how long ago it was or for how long he lived. He was still your baby!", "NTA, this is pretty disgusting of your wife to be honest. Everyone grieves and heals differently. She's either a raging narcissist or there's something else wrong in your marriage and she's using this as a convenient outlet. Either way, she's being garbage here.", "\"For clarity, I always go after my daughter goes to bed.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat took this from hmmm to NTA so fucking fast. Make your shit wife read this.", "NTA I still mourn the loss of my son 10 years ago this November. He lived 93 agonizing minutes after being born. \nI can say, I highly suggest couples counseling with someone who specializes in losing a child. Therapy has helped me tremendously. \n\nI'm so very sorry for your loss.", "NTA. But perhaps you both need counselling.", "NTA, nobody gets to tell you when you\u2019re done grieving.", "I'm so sorry OP. This is how you find comfort in your loss and how you feel about this is valid. You anticipated the birth of your son the same and envisioned a life with him the same. This grief isn't comparable, and is incomprehensible. You are not obligated to let go of your son and move on, but please take care of yourself.\n\nYour wife perhaps feels a sense of superiority for being the person who has carried them both, and perhaps feels the way she processed the grief is the proper way. I don't believe she has moved on, but she's comfortable with how she's found closure; and unfortunately she feels entitled to decide your feelings on the matter. That approach is wrong objectively and morally.\n\nYou're NTA.", "I was on your wife\u2019s side until you mentioned that you only go after your daughter goes to bed so NTA. as long as you make sure the time your daughter is awake on her birthday with her and celebrating, then it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to take the remainder of the night to spend time at your son\u2019s grave. I can understand why she might not want to go anymore but she can\u2019t dictate how you experienced and dealt with the loss of your son. Grief is expressed in different ways for everyone.\n\nI think you two need a long talk with a grief counselor to how and why her grief has her express herself like that towards your son and come to an understanding that you two have different feelings about it and find a way to accept that. Your wife might have some unresolved grief / trauma surrounding his death", "NTA my older brother had a twin who only lived a few hours. He and our sister were born 2 years before me. Every year on their birthday and holidays my mom would visit my sisters grave with flowers and I always tagged along. There is absolutely nothing wrong remembering and loving your son no matter how short or long his life was.", "NTA.  It's great that you went to therapy for a while after you lost your son, but your daughter hitting milestones will always make you think of your son who should be here sharing those with her.  It's likely that everything she gets to celebrate will also carry with it a bit of grief, so it's important to continue working on having healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nI don't think you're living in the past, but you and your wife clearly grieve in different ways, and it's an emotional day for both of you, even if those emotions weren't expressed in the healthiest ways.  It's sad that her birthday is also the anniversary of her brother's death, and you've obviously found what you feel the best way for you to express the wide range of emotions you must be feeling on that day.  It also sounds like although your wife might not want to visit the cemetery, she might be feeling lonely and abandoned with her thoughts when you leave her on what was obviously a very painful day for her as well.", "NTA for visiting your son s grave. She should respect that. You loved your son and you miss him, even that he lived outside the whom for 3 hours. Is your feelings not hers and you should respect yourself. If you ned to visit every year untill you died is your right.   YTA for yelling at your wife, that wasnt needed.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to grieve and remember your baby boy on his birthday. You wait until his sister is asleep.\n\nYou shouldn't have yelled but we are all human.\n\nCan you see if you and your wife can get into marriage counseling?\n\nShe might be grieving in a different way. Or even maybe feeling guilty for not grieving? (Which is fine. Btw. There is no rule saying that she has to still be grieving.)\n\nIf your grieving is keeping you from functioning and taking care of yourself and your family? Then worry. Remembering your son on his birthday (and maybe father's day or Christmas) is normal and fine! There is a reason there are gravesites.\n\nI hope you and your wife can get counseling.", "NTA. I have a friend who lost her 3 months old to SIDS. Every year since, on the baby\u2019s birth and death day, she, her husband, and their other children visit the grave. It\u2019s been at least 20 years.", "NTA. She can\u2019t control how you grieve your child. It\u2019s insensitive, disrespectful and mean. It\u2019s ok if SHE wants to forget what happened, but she can\u2019t force that on you.", "NTA\n\nI would tell her she needs to talk to someone.  You are going to your child's grave on the anniversary of their death.  \n\n She is angry because you are reminding her of that pain as the nond between mother and child, but idk twins and all.\n\nWife seems. To be a giant ah.", "NTA Mourning your son on your daughters birthday just for a bit is perfectly fine it doesn't mean your living in the past.", "Yes and neither did she.  I think there\u2019s probably more to what exactly was shouted by OP and but I\u2019d still lean NAH. Grieving and remembrance are so personal.  If they\u2019re not already going to therapy they should.  She\u2019s obviously been holding a lot back.", "I wonder too if there isn't some sexism or perceived sexism in that the dad is grieving his son? \n\nAnd how exactly did they BOTH go to the grave yet do that after daughter was already in bed? Or was daughter young enough they just put her in a car seat for the trip?", "NAH. y'all need therapy. i'm so sorry for your loss..", "I was wondering that. How would she have come? Their daughter was sleeping but someone still needed to be in the house", "Everyone experiences grief in their own unique way, nah. While she makes an effort to forgive and move on, you attempt to honor his memory.", "Especially since she was the one that gave birth -- she might be dealing with additional trauma by reliving the experience.  For some women, parts of their brain essentially rewires based on the puberty-level hormone change that happens during pregnancy / postpartum.  \n\nI do not mean to belittle OPs need to grieve.  I just mean to have empathy and grace for everyone in that home and how hard it might be for both parents in different ways.", " She is angry that he doesn't realise that,,", "I was wondering that. How would she have come? Their daughter was sleeping but someone still needed to be in the house", "Thank you for your opinion, and I am usually gone for one to one and a half hours, including the drive. I think she was using hyperbole in the heat of the moment. We already had a little counseling directly after our son\u2019s passing, but you\u2019re probably right that we need to go back in for more counseling.", "When l say only alive for 3 hours is not to be demeaning it's just to show that no matter the amount of time, it's still hard and traumatic experience", "I think you mean ESH not ETA, ETA usually means \"edited to add\"", "OP.    Please see this. This is 100% correct.", ">and really shows how little your son mattered to her.\n\nWhat a terrible thing to say and completely unwarranted. She carried her son for 9 months and then gave birth to him. And somehow you think she managed to care about her daughter but not her son through all that. Your comment shows that you clearly don't understand loss, grief or healing. OP's wife wants to focus on the living instead of being dragged back to the trauma and grief that she physically and emotionally experienced. Wtf are you to claim that means her son didn't matter to her. Your comment is vile.", "That's not fair to the wife. Daughter is alive and has a personality, habits, voice, smiles. Someone alive for 3 hours opposed to someone alive are not comparable. Her not grieving the same way or for the same amount of time doesn't mean son didn't matter to her. It means that she has put HER son's  DEATH behind her and is focusing on HER LIVING child. She's accepted son's death. She is angry that he doesn't realise that.", ">and is favoring your daughter over your son\n\n\u2026do you even read what you\u2019ve typed here?!? She better fucking be favouring their *alive* daughter over their dead son. If you favour a dead child over an alive one, you probably *should not have children*\n\nIt\u2019s not about how little their son mattered to her, it\u2019s about the fact that living in the past and not letting oneself move past grief can be exhausting. Being constantly reminded of that sorrow. I respect that OP may still need an outlet for grief, but his wife isn\u2019t wrong either for wanting to move past it and try to focus on the future. Grief can be crippling and cause people to be stuck constantly looking backwards instead of looking toward the joys that are on the horizon. OP needs to grieve, but also has a wonderful daughter who is alive and *should* be the top most priority for both parents, unlike whatever weird thing you\u2019ve suggested where it\u2019s okay to favour a child who isn\u2019t still living over one who is.", "I\u2019d still say the shouting was definitely unwarranted. You can\u2019t assume that the wife isn\u2019t hurting/grieving in her own way.", "Depends how she meant barely alive. This may cause her pain. The fact that OP left he didn't stay with her. She carried and birthed her son and the fact that he only lived 3 hours may cause a lot of pain and the view that since he was alive for such a short time  telling herself he was barely alive may help her grieve", "Daughter is in bed when he goes.", "I go to visit my mom at night and im 21F, it's really not that creepy, the only people that are usually there (if any) are also people visiting their deceased loved ones and the groundskeeper", "Used to live next to 5 cemeteries as a child/teen. Used to play hide n seek as well as tag, both in the dark, in those cemeteries. And before anyone freaks out, no, we didn't walk on Graves, though I did fall into open ones, twice. Siblings and I were taught how to respect Graves and we most hid behind trees, gardening/lawncare buildings, pillars at certain gathering areas within (falling in the Graves was that they were too close to a road and looked like regular ground in the dark.)\n\nBut everyone grieves differently and in their own time. Best to start with a discussion and seek therapy/counseling for both spouses.", "Did you read the part where he said he goes after she goes to sleep so that she won't know the difference? He is thinking about his daughter.", "OP specifically stated he waits until his daughter goes to bed. He spends the entire day with her *first*, and then goes to visit his son.", "I disagree with this pov. The daughter has her parent 364 days a year. That's enough time to share.", "He said he goes after his daughter is in bed for the night. Did you read the whole thing?", "Reading comprehension is so important. Read to the end.", "That's not necessarily a bad thing. Letting go.", "Calling her a shit wife is really uncalled for.", "I mean I\u2019m assuming someone babysat the daughter for them for a few hours when they previously went together, probably after she was in bed for the night.", "Or got a babysitter?", "Why aren't we just assuming \"always\" refers to the two times he went alone instead of expecting every sentence in this man's story to be literal?", "I don't think they did both go to the grave; I think it's just him, and she resents being left home alone with the baby on her birthday.", "Right, was just wondering the same thing. Are these the only children, and if perhaps the wife feels he is a bit obsessed about the loss of a son, specifically.", "OP visits his son's grave alone.\n\nMom can't be bothered", "I mean did she want him to stay home with her..", "I lost my mom a year ago (ik a big difference between mom/child loss) and l went to therapy immediately after and then stopped for a long while, and i've recently returned and have realized there's a lot more stuff i've been grieving about now than l had been a year ago, so imo i'd really give a look into doing it again. Im very sorry for your loss, im sure everything will be okay between you and your wife, everything just needs to cool down before you can have a calm conversation about everyone's feelings :)", "I think so. If you talk together as a family, you can probably learn how to make your wife and daughter feel like you're giving them the attention they want, without it preventing you from going to visit your son's grave for a while. \n\nMy brother still commemorates the birthday of his middle daughter, who was stillborn almost 40 years ago.", "Counseling might help. She might also be someone who just handles death differently. Some people don't like to remember, especially with her giving birth so her body was already in a state when she had to initially process it. You don't have to give details but if you were able to spend any of the 3 hours with him, she was probably still having a very hard time. She might not really have any good memories and emotions that come up when thinking of him, so she is more willing to shut out the past. \n\nI don't know your wife. I just have a mix of first and second hand experience with different aspects of what you discussed. I do think counseling might help I just also think she may have processed it differently than you, but did process it.", "I mean some spouses go for jogs that long.  Good luck", "OP still very obviously cares about his daughter, and goes out of his way to make sure that he's celebrated his daughters special day and cares for his family before visiting his son, as he has made clear on his post that he goes out after his daughter goes to sleep. I'm not saying that his wife is wrong for getting over her son, however she does not need to deliver her message link that, especially since he's causing no harm by going after his daughter is asleep.", "I think the comment minimizes the life of the lost child, which while it may help the mother grieve, I would argue it\u2019s very unhealthy and the wrong approach. It\u2019s almost like trying to bury the trauma with the child and shove it into the back of your mind and ignoring that it happened", "What country are you in?  Might I ask...where my family is all buried, there are no lights.  I would be scared out of my mind.  Lol!!!  I think that's nice though if they are lit up.", "I find cemeteries so peaceful.", ">the only people that are usually there (if any) are also people visiting their deceased loved ones and the groundskeeper\n\nYou forgot vampires and serial killers.", "I would DIE...if I fell in a grave. Did you freak out?  Lol!!!  Awesome story, though.", "If it happens naturally, sure. OP\u2019s wife is demanding he let go on her timeline and in a specific way. Also, OP may simply not want to; his wife objects to a perfectly legitimate act of remembrance that OP reserves for a time when it won\u2019t interfere with his daughter\u2019s enjoyment of her birthday.\n\nI wonder if OP\u2019s wife wants OP to grieve less visibly because she fears being seen as a bad mother for having moved forward differently? These folks need professional help, stat.", "He said that they used to go together but starting last year she stopped coming. So presumably she went for 1, 2, and 3rd birthdays.", "Where did you get that from? He clearly says they used to go together.", "Hey, that\u2019s not cool. Don\u2019t say \u201cMom can\u2019t be bothered\u201d. You don\u2019t get to police how someone grieves or for how long they openly have to act out that grief.
