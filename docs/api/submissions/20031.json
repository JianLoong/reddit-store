On that grounds,  NTA. \n\nBut one thing to consider is that your wife sees this as something that brings that pain back.  Losing a child is the hardest thing imaginable, and you and your wife are dealing with it differently.  Your way of dealing with it makes it harder for her to deal with it her way.   The way for you to resolve that starts with understanding that.", "NTA. Grieve how you need to. I would guess your wife\u2019s outburst came from her going through her own grieving process. But just because she wants to move on one way, doesn\u2019t mean you need to do the same. \n\nI think you should consider couples counseling with a counselor who specializes in child loss.", "NAH. There\u2019s no right or wrong way to grieve the loss of your child. Neither of you are wrong or an AH.\n\nETA.

Your wife is TA for telling you how to grieve, only you know what you need, etc. but you are TA for blowing up on her as maybe that's something she's been telling herself to help with her grief. Id recommend going to a grief therapist (the both of you) because losing a child (even if it was only alive for 3 hours) is traumatic and can cause underlying mental health issues you may not know are there until you get triggered.", "NAH everyone grieves differently.

You are both grieving in your own ways. \n\nI wonder if perhaps you could do a new tradition where you have a little birthday cupcake and candle that you and your wife blow out on the day (once daughter is in bed) to commentate him and visit your son on the weekend before/after. Your wife may be feeling guilt about the day not being focused on your living daughter, she may be feeling guilt that your daughter gets to celebrate the birthday and he doesn\u2019t. She may be remembering the day as a day of loss of him rather than celebration. She may just want to spend the evening with you at home remembering him rather than staring at his headstone. \n\nI don\u2019t think either are wrong but I think you both need to work on this before it tears you apart.", "NAH (for now) .

And it doesn't really matter. \nPersonally, I'd acknowledge the mistake I made (and its impact) with an apology, without qualifying with why I did it. I like the ABC /XYZ form of conflict resolution which focuses on the behavior and how you felt, rather than the character of the other person.\nI'd bring up the topic of your lost child with her at a different time to have an open conversation about it in a similar manner. It always helps to mention what you'd like someone to do (rather than what they shouldn't), and describing why that's important to you.\nAll the best.", "NAH. I think you guys need therapy.

Grief and loss are incredibly difficult and everyone experiences it differently.", "I am deeply sorry for the loss of your son. Did you seek therapy after your loss? I am wondering if there is a part of you that blames your daughter for the loss of your son. Eventually, if you maintain this ritual, she will notice.

It's not like you're there every day and neglecting the rest of your family.\n\nMy stillborn sister (who was never alive out of the womb at all) had a cake and party every year on her birthday for almost ten years.

I respect your choice to visit his grave whenever you feel the need. I would never judge.  I do, however, want to say that I don't think going or not going is a measure of your level of love. It's a personal thing about grieving and loss.  I disagree with the person who said your wife doesn't love your son.  You might always want to visit on his birthday in which case it's vitally important to your marriage and your daughter for them to understand.  And on the flip side you should try to understand your wife's need to focus on pouring her efforts into your daughter who deserves to be the center of attention on her birthday.  I hope you can become closer as a result and not separate.", "NAH, im very sorry for your loss. Other commentors are correct; everyone grieves differently. If you aren't in counceling, consider it. At the very least, you both need to sit down and hash out your feelings, and hopefully come to an understanding to help you both move forward. I can't imagine what you've been through, I wish you the best.", "I gotta go with NAH. You are allowed to grieve whenever and for however long you\u2019d like. I feel like your wife may be grieving and can\u2019t handle it. She may not be able to handle the reminder every year and the thing is, your daughters birthday is also a reminder to her of the day her son was born and passed away. It\u2019s possible that visiting the grave is just to real for her. And perhaps her issue with the evenings is that by the end of the day she is distraught and she wishes you were there to help her. It\u2019s hard to say. My recommendation is you should both go to a grief counsellor if your haven\u2019t already, and/or marriage counselling. It\u2019s obviously an issue that you both need to work on. It\u2019s unfair to ask you to change your ritual, but it\u2019s also unfair to expect her to just go with it if it really bothers her. Sorry for your loss OP and good luck to you all.", "NAH\n\nThis is surely a difficult day for both of you. I can imagine she could get to a pretty dark place being on her own with your daughter in bed and you away for an hour or two at night.  And obviously visiting a loved one\u2019s grave on their birthday is completely understandable. 5 years is nothing, no amount of time will make the pain go away completely.\n\nNot sure what the solution is, you both need what you need, but it starts with some honest and compassionate communication.", "This is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. If you have not gotten therapy, you should. I had, in the course of 16 months, a NICU baby, a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and a high risk (given the last two) pregnancy and c section). We separated when my youngest was six weeks old. We divorced. We got back together after a few years. THIS. SHIT. IS. HARD. Seek counseling together and separately.", "NTA\n\nBut, can I offer a little insight perhaps on the situation.\n\nBeing a mum is hard, and birthdays are hard and busy and long. The preparation before, running everything during and then clear up after. My partner would say he\u2019s really helpful and he\u2019s present on the day, and he is, but the bulk of the mental load comes from me. \n\nHaving to do that and make the day special for my living child whilst also having to manage grief and probably guilt for not acknowledging enough my child that passed would be unbearable. I would feel guilty towards my daughter to have a \u2018slightly sad\u2019 moment on her birthday, she deserves a day of sunshine. But I\u2019d feel guilt for not giving my son the acknowledgment he deserves also. Then throw in all the other birthday stresses\u2026\n\nShe\u2019s probably jealous you get to grieve in the way she hates herself for not being able too, or because she\u2019s trying not to do it in front of your daughter. She\u2019s still going to be grieving loosing her son, and wondering what if and dealing with another year passing without her son, watching your daughter hit milestones she will never see him hit.\n\nSo, my recommendation is to find a way you can both grieve and acknowledge him as a family, without letting grief interfere with your daughters birthday. She\u2019s right in that sense, grieving the day before or after won\u2019t change much. But it might impact your daughter knowing that her special day is tarnished by grief for a sibling she barely knows.\n\nBut don\u2019t be mad at her, she\u2019s still a mama whose lost a baby, struggling with conflicting emotions and demands of motherhood at such a difficult time.", "I think there is more to this than you're admitting!", "They let you visit a graveyard at night?\n\n\nN-T-A if you are not leaving your wife with all the work and clean up.", "NTA you never get over the loss of a child.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is though.

You are NTA for visiting your son's grave. It sounds like you and your wife might benefit from talking to someone about your feelings and moving forward as your daughter gets older. It will be important for both of you to learn how to balance your grief on this day along with being present in all ways to celebrate your daughter's birthday.", "As a fellow loss parent (loss mom), you are certainly NTA. These birthdays/anniversaries never get easier. My daughter died during labor and was stillborn. Having a birthday and a death day wrapped into one is really complicated. Your complexity is tenfold because you also have a daughter to celebrate. I can only imagine the increase of stress going on for you, your wife, and probably your daughter with enough time. I agree with others that revisiting couples grief therapy would be helpful. \n\nWhat is your sons name? Happy birthday to both of your children.", "NAH but I suspect that you disappearing for nearly two hours on the day she gave birth and lost the baby has something to do with that. The child she carried for close to ten months died, all that time inside her protecting them and your son died. Maybe she wants some comfort and rest after trying to juggle the best/worst day of her life. I definitely feel like you two are in dire need of couples therapy and to not be alone when you're clearly both still mourning", "NAH. At most, you two might benefit from some therapy. Her feelings are valid, as valid as yours. Maybe she feels guilty for no longer going, maybe she's tired of mourning her son. There are a lot of reasons for her feelings and yours. I think a licensed professional who handles families and grief would be helpful. Best of luck.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong. Do you guys even talk about him, does your daughter know she had a brother? I think your wife needs counseling and maybe you two as a couple need counseling too. I lost a child, my kids all know they had an older brother. I had counseling after he passed, it's not something you forget", "NTA. My mom was an identical twin whose sister died in infancy. I don't recall how long her twin lived, but I don't believe it was for more than a few days, if a full day at all. While she/we don't make annual trips to the gravesite, my mom does go every now and then, and each time she gets pretty emotional.\n\nI am absolutely stunned by your wife's words. This was her child too, and yet she seems to be very apathetic towards her son's death, especially since the time you are taking to visit the grave isn't interfering with celebrating your living daughter. I almost wonder if she just feels it's better to forget (not a healthy approach IMO; repression of grief or guilt never works long-term) and your visits keep reminding her, so she's getting angry at you instead. She needs help.", "Hey dude. NAH. One thing that may be worth considering (just offering a different take, based purely on speculation) is that almost all women blame themselves for the loss of their child, be it early on in the pregnancy through miscarriage or later on through things like sudden infant death syndrome. So perhaps she is reading your (I think very appropriate) way of remembering your son as a deeply painful activity because she is confronted by her own perception that the death was her fault (horrid thoughts like \u2018had I been more healthy / taken more care then this would never have happened\u2019). So yes, counselling to get to the bottom of this and move forwards together", "NTA. And honestly I have a hard time saying this but your wife was way out of line with that barely lived comment. Bring his sister next time maybe the day before or after their birthday. Moving on is important but so is remembering your son. This seems like the best way to do that.", "NAH,  you are allowed to grieve the way you want and remember your son on his birthday but has your wife had any form of grief support or counciling?  \n\nmany women that experience this unfortunate situation can blame themselves.  That they were the one that was meant to keep them safe. \n\nYou need to find a healthy way to discuss how to go forward.  Find a way to both heal.", "NAH.  I don't know how to say this in a nicer way but could it be that your remembrance of your son puts you in a mood that is a downer on the celebration of your daughter?  Obviously since they were twins, and the death happened on the same day as the birth, that is going to be both a sorrowful and joyful day.  That's a rollercoaster of emotions and maybe it's making it more difficult to heal emotionally for you and/or your wife.  Could you perhaps consider going to visit your son the day before to honor his memory and spend the next day celebrating your daughter?  That separation of a few hours might just be enough to help you and your wife to get past this difficulty.", "NTA - you should be horrified by this incredibly insensitive behavior. She should be apologizing as well for attacking you for simply grieving.", "NTA. She is invalidating your feelings HARD. Also, who talks like that about their deceased child???", "NTA. OMG.

Ignoring the fact that you lost a child is never the way to heal.\n\nWhat I would suggest, besides a better therapist, is to have a talk with your wife and find out why she gets so upset and what you can do so that your both able to grieve alone and share your grief and healing together.  Maybe you\u2019ll have to go early in the morning to visit and bring birthday breakfast back so that your there with her when she needs you to be by her side.\n\nThere is no single answer to your situation.  I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I hope you\u2019re able to work through these harder times together.", "While I don\u2019t disagree with you main point that the daughter needs him present I do disagree with the implication that he only lived only a few hours. He was alive in her womb for (presumably) 9 months, he was kicking, moving, interacting with both parents. Yes he was out of the womb for such a short time but he lived and he was loved!", "And then yell at his wife till she decides to pack up and leave?\n\nI feel like most people are glossing over this part. He had no right to yell at her for expressing how she was feeling. Especially when his living child was sleeping after their birthday. The lack of self awareness of this guy is insane\n\nI get that he's going through stuff, but he's still a firm YTA from me. And his wife might be one, but much softer YTA, she mostly just sounds tired", "Actually, her actions show that she has NOT accepted her son\u2019s death. She\u2019s buried it. \n\nIf she had accepted the death, then she wouldn\u2019t be so upset with her husband choosing to visit their son on his birthday, for half an hour, after their daughter is in bed. This isn\u2019t harmful or unhealthy; in the contrary, this is a perfectly normal thing many people do.\n\nWife is upset because husband going means she has to remember. She has to remember the reality that she had a son, he existed, and now he doesn\u2019t. It is easier for her to pretend he \u2018never lived\u2019 than to live with the reality that he died. She wants to forget her son and bury her grief with him. That\u2019s not healthy, and she\u2019s lashing out at her husband because his visits force her to remember what she\u2019s lost.", "I did, however from his own words his wife views it otherwise. Why?\n\nAnd as his daughter gets older it will become a problem.\n\nHe\u2019s thinking about himself.", "Except it\u2019s her birthday.\n\nThere\u2019s been other posts on this sub and others of the living sibling upset having to share their birthday with someone they never knew.\n\nLike it or not grief will always trump celebrations", "Then maybe his wife needs him, whether she said hurtful things or not you never get over the loss of a child. You don\u2019t get to abandon your partner when they\u2019re grieving as well, you support each other through it. Most families who suffer the loss of a child end up in divorce. So the child\u2019s sleeping and she\u2019s home all alone on her deceased child\u2019s birthday? That sounds lonely and sad, and to make it even worse she has a partner.", "I feel like you might have missed a word in your reply?   I can only imagine what\u2019s going through her head as a mother myself, but there\u2019s way more happening than a visit to a graveyard to cause her visit to her parents.", "I'm puzzled by how late this cemetery is open.", "I was wondering that. How would she have come? Their daughter was sleeping but someone still needed to be in the house", "It is. Here there are no gates and you can go whenever.", "It's an \"up to each individual cemetery\" thing in my city. Some of them close their gates at night, most don't. Pretty sure they all find a way to lock up on Halloween night, but that's about it.", ">My wife used to come with me, but last year, she didn\u2019t.

I'm sure she would have liked to be together and lean on each other for that.", "Thank you for saying this. I felt like I was on fucking crazy pills reading some of those comments.", "Well said", "I would think losing any child is devastating.  Sounds like the wife is processing her grief by well, starting to block it out/let go/moving on.\n\nI won\u2019t comment on that beyond saying I\u2019ve been in therapy for loss and it\u2019s commonly accepted now that the past method of \u201clet go, move on\u201d is in fact, really harmful.  \n\nIt\u2019s better to maintain some form of connection and admittedly that can be hard to find your way to when you didn\u2019t know the person because they were a baby so you never got that \u201cpersonhood\u201d to connect with and know.\n\nWe\u2019ve struggled with it in our own way as well - trying to find the path isn\u2019t easy.  And what seems to work for OP is visiting the grave on their son\u2019s birthday and I think that is perfectly fine and healthy and he\u2019s cognisant of doing it in the evening after his daughter is in bed so he\u2019s given her the attention she deserves during her waking hours.", "Babysitting babies and sharing their day with your little girl is just the sweetest thing I\u2019ve seen all day, awe. What a rad Dad.", "Thank you! Also, your daughter has fantastic parents!", "I think you should consider couples counseling with a counselor who specializes in child loss,,", "Uh.. mom has a living child to worry about. It may sound cold, but the dead child doesn\u2019t care if his grave is visited. Doing that is for the person visiting\u2019s healing and remembrance of their deceased loved one. \n\nAnd the post clearly said that the wife used to visit the grave as well but hadn\u2019t the past 2 times. You\u2019re ripping on her for her lack of caring, but you don\u2019t seem to have much empathy yourself, sir.", "A dead person's grave exists to be ritually visited, but it, or the Soul of the deceased it commemorates, doesn't actually get sad or angry from Not being visited, people can grieve in places other than cemeteries (and many people, Like Refugees or other peope who live far away from where their family members died, HAVE to grieve their dead in places other than where they were buried.)", "I think it's more likely that they just took their daughter with them in the past, because she was little enough to not understand it and for it not to overshadow her birthday. At 4/5, she probably would understand, and it would be cruel to take her there on her birthday.", "That's not what the person you responded to was trying to say at all. They were saying that there is a biological change that comes with pregnancy and that can compound other issues. That's not invalidating his grief, it's stating a fact separate from his grief.", "not what they said.", "If someone is at their best while grieving, they are the exception, not the rule. \n\nIt's easy to expect perfect rationality when communicating in text. In real life, people have feelings while talking, and don't have the kind of time to think that they would have when writing.", "This is a thoughtful and beautiful response to this impossible situation", "[deleted]", "Different people value life differently. Before the last hundred years, infant mortality used to be insane globally. Some people have more emotional resources to afford their partner stepping out to observe this particular kind of death every year.

He has said nothing to show any care or love for his daughter beyond waiting until she goes to bed.\n\nMaybe he wanted a son and is showing this more clearly than he realises.

The cemeteries I'm familiar with don't close.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "Well, I was just assuming it was after the daughter went to bed. Maybe they used to go together in the morning. Plus not all cemeteries have \u201copening hours\u201d so it really depends. It\u2019s not that unusual to be able to visit a grave at night.", "Right?  In US, at least where Iive, they close at dusk or a set time, like 4 pm.  I assumed that would be common everywhere.  And how long does it take to visit a grave?  Is the cemetery hours away?

It\u2019s obvious that their grieving styles aren\u2019t synching up and theyre both hurting in their own ways, and they need to communicate better. My comment here is in response to the people who keep saying \u201cWait but if they used to go to the cemetery together\u2026 then who was watching the daughter\u2026? \ud83e\udd14\u201d as though that\u2019s a hole in the story or something.", "Exactly, putting the kid to sleep, cleaning up after the party and after everything else is done for the day the mom is left alone on an emotional day and the dad prefers to spend the night at the cemetery instead of being emotionally and physically there for the loved ones that are still alive and living. Don't OP understand that his wife might need some support too? Maybe want to sit together at home paying respect for both of their children together? \n\nLosing a child is terrible but you have to live for the living. And while the wife is putting her own grief aside to provide childhood memories and a wonderfull celebration of their living daughter, OP is not there for his grieving wife on this complicated day on the one moment the wife could actually catch a break when the kid is asleep.", "While a lot of cities may have locked cemeteries any town/country cemetery I've ever been to doesn't.", "They might have taken their daughter, gone at different times, had someone babysit while she was sleeping\u2026", "By the 4th birthday, the daughter is focused on the special day, so the mother probably feels it's inappropriate to prioritise a visit to the grave. It would be a huge burden on the daughter to know that her birthday is a day of grieving for the family.
