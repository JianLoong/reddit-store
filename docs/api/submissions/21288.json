Harsh yes. But only because you were pushed. \n\nOP said no and that she wasn't comfortable taking older niece first, which is entirely understandable. If I don't know someone well, no matter their age, I don't want to be responsible for them in another country. OP doesn't know if the kid will respect rules, behave themselves etc. \n\nTaking a child overseas and being responsible for them is a lot of work, when they're practically an adult and the same size as you it can be even harder because if they don't want to do something, you can't even pick them up like a screaming toddler to get them on the plane. \n\nThen the mother pushed with a 'you have to love and treat them the same'. First of all life doesn't work like that, and second of all why does she have to love someone she doesn't know? \n\nEveryone on here says blood doesn't make family when people are leaving shitty family situations, but she *must* love her niece that she is just now, getting to know because they're related? The math doesn't math. \n\nAnd people picking on her about not wanting to spend money. OF COURSE she doesn't want to. I'm not wanting to spend what could be in the $5000+, depending on flights accommodation etc, on someone I barely know either, relative or not.", "I'm going to get downvoted for this, but NTA.\n\nYou didn't say you hated or even disliked Olivia. You said *you didn't love her,* which is a fact, and the reason is not that Olivia is inherently unlovable, but because you barely know her. She's almost a stranger to you.\n\nI think that's a reasonable position. I don't love people I don't know, no matter how closely they are related to me.\n\nI'm actually in a similar position to you. I have lots of nieces and nephews. One of my brothers has three children (all now grown up) by three different women. I'll call them A, B, and C.\n\nI hardly ever saw A and B when they were growing up, but C I saw frequently. As a result, I'm much closer to C than I am to A and B, and C did a lot to help me after I became disabled. I saw A and B so little over the years, they can probably barely remember my name, and I'll bet they couldn't pick me out of a police lineup.\n\nI too am thinking of going on an overseas trip in the next couple of years, and I've been toying with the idea of inviting C as a travel companion. It's possible A and B would be upset if they found out. *But I don't know them.* They're almost strangers to me. And I don't want to go on a trip with strangers.\n\n*She said they are both my nieces and I should love and treat them equally.*\n\n\"Love them equally\" is ridiculous. Love is a feeling; you can't help who you love, only how you show it.\n\n\"Treat them equally\" is an argument with slightly more merit, especially if the children are very young. But Olivia is 15, and I'd argue that is old enough to understand that you really can't expect a person to spend a large amount of money on you when they barely know you.", "NTA. She sounds entitled as fuck.", "ESH.  Olivia's mom can ask, but shouldn't demand.  Since your answer is \"No,\" her focus should be on helping Olivia manage her feelings about not going on the trip, not on trying to manipulate you into taking her daughter.  How does she imagine that will end well?\n\nHowever, you could have been nicer and smarter about this, and still have been 100% honest.  How about \"Ofc Olivia is my niece.  However, she's grown up seeing us once a year, so we don't know Olivia well, and she also doesn't really know us.  I wouldn't be comfortable taking her on a long international trip, and I doubt she'd be comfortable either once the initial excitement wears off.  When she gets homesick or tired or lonely, I wouldn't be able to focus just on her with all her cousins to take care of as well, and frankly this is my vacation, too.  Maybe in a few years, when we've gotten to know each other better, things will be different.\"", "NTA. They moved away and although that is not Olivia's fault, the outcome of that is that you don't know her well. She is not entitled to go on the trip with you and your other niece. I wouldn't want to go on a trip to another country with a teenager I barely know and also have to pay for.\n\nHowever, I do think you could have handled it better. Hopefully you won't hold a grudge against Olivia for her mom's actions and give her a chance to bond with you", "NTA you don\u2019t know the girl taking her on vacation is not a good idea. Of course you don\u2019t love her you don\u2019t know her. You\u2019re right if her mom had allowed her to be closer to her family it might be different.", "You could have dealt with it a little less harsh but well truth be told you have no relationship with the other niece and obviously it is uncomfortable, if not slightly dangerous, taking her on a trip. If you wanna have a relation with your niece I would talk with her mom, since they live nearby, to arrange some meetings, trips together to create a bond. And then you will see. NTA.", "It sounds like you discussed the holiday situation in front of Olivia's mum... That is a lil tackless. Her pushing to try and get her daughter involved when she's not allowed a relationship to blossom between you, also tackless. But announcing you do not love her child, did not need to be said. You could have just said \"I barely know her, I'm not comfortable with that, maybe the next holiday when we know her better\". Not \"I do not love her and it's your fault\", as true as it may be, to say it like that is almost like trying to start a fight. No one wins here. You should be asking for time with your niece, to make up for the time you haven't had. It doesn't have to be the holiday, just regular contact.", "ESH\n\nOlivia\u2019s mom should realize the relationship dynamics and not push for inclusion on the trip. However, you could have handled that about 1000x better.", "NTA. I care what anyone says love isn\u2019t an instant thing it takes time to develop. I adore my nephew. I don\u2019t get to see him all that often but when I do he\u2019s sweet and so adorable. You niece and you have no connection so for her mom to just assume she will benefit from this is outrageous", "NTA.  However the timing you announced that you are going on a trip was not right.  You should've done it when Olivia and her mother was not present.  It would've save a lot of explaining to do.  And I think it was unnecessary for you to say that you don't love your other niece.", "Umm did you say that in front of Olivia? Cause then Y T A. If not, then you\u2019re good.", "So it\u2019s a soft YTA . Your correct in not taking Olivia, you don\u2019t know her. I feel like the wording of your response could be better. Instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t love Olivia\u201d which could be really damaging to any future relationship with her and very upsetting for a 15 year old, I probably would have just said \u201cmyself and my children don\u2019t know Olivia, and a trip overseas is not the best way to get to know someone new\u201d\n\nI think what you said was meant to be jarring to Olivia\u2019s mother and honestly she deserved it, but I don\u2019t think Olivia deserves to feel like her extended family is already against her for something that wasn\u2019t her fault.", "You\u2019re kind of an asshole", "You were pretty harsh in how you answered Olivia\u2019s mother. Stating you don\u2019t love your niece pretty much makes you TA. \n\nHowever. You *know* Freya. You know her behaviors, you know whether or not you can safely manage to take her to a (I\u2019m assuming) distant foreign country. You are confident that Freya will be safe in your care while traveling. \n\nYou don\u2019t really know Olivia. How would she behave while traveling? Can you trust that you can safely take care of this minor child on an international trip? You don\u2019t know. \n\nSo, back it up. Apologize to Olivia\u2019s mother for your harsh statements. Because what you said was very harsh. But also tell her that taking her child to a foreign country is not the appropriate time to get to know someone. Spend some time with Olivia at home. Get to know her. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to treat both children equally. But you also don\u2019t need to be so unkind. It\u2019s not Olivia\u2019s fault her mom lived so far away.", "Could\u2019ve left it at the \u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d in my opinion. If you don\u2019t know her, it\u2019s hard to say you do love or not love her.  She is your niece, you should love her even in the absence and distance. Don\u2019t let the anger for her mother impact your opinion of the daughter.", "INFO why did Olivia's mom move her to another city and limit seeing her only once a year?", "Don't blame a child for their adults mistakes.", "I think that a better thing to say would have been that whether or not you love Olivia isn't the point, the point is that her mother intentionally created a situation in which you barely know Olivia and you don't feel comfortable taking a kid you don't know to Turkey.\n\nSaying you don't love her will undoubtedly get back to Olivia, who is a kid and will feel terribly hurt, not understanding that her mother is responsible for all this, and not even being aware that you tried to call and her mother made even this kind of contact all but impossible.\n\nSo I think you're not at all an A for not taking Olivia with you or for not loving her; you barely know her, \n\nBut YTA for *saying* you don't love her.  There are some true things that it's much better not to say out loud as they can badly hurt children unnecessarily.", "YTA for planning the trip in front of people who weren\u2019t invited.", "ESH. Claiming to love a random kid you barely know just because you happen to be related would be much weirder. Her mother was very inappropriate. However you shouldn't make this sort of comments in front of your niece.", "Man you're nta for not taking a kid you have no relationship with on holiday but jesus christ dude. You know the woman is vindictive so you gave her the perfect ammo to make her kid feel like shit and you look like the bad guy? I feel bad for Olivia because it looks like she won't even have a relationship with you if you can't get past how much you hate her mother.", "Jesus Christ that's harsh. ESH\n\nThat could have been handled much better. Much, much better. With tact and grace. Maybe explaining that you didn't have the same chance to bond with Olivia and you're not comfortable taking her on that trip. Not \"I don't love her\". Good lord. We can be honest without being brutal. Not sure what everyone's obsession with trampling over the feelings of others is all about but some of you need a damn hug. \n\nThe mom should not have asked. That's some entitled AH behavior. \n\nThat poor kid. She's done nothing wrong and will lose out on family because of the actions of adults. \n\nWhy don't you try and develop a relationship now? You could have two amazing nieces and not even know it. Go do something with just Olivia. \n\nBut enjoy your trip with just you and Freya. And maybe show some grace to Olivia. Not her mom. Her mom can f off.", "Are you punishing the ex of your brother but not his current wife?", "Yta.", "YTA. For saying that. Other ways to go about the situation.  I can't fathom reacting that way.

Blaming someone for moving is pretty crummy but acting like you were entitled to the child. \"Took her away from us\" as if she belonged to you? Really gross. Telling someone you don't love their child is beyond the pale. You could have done this in a mature and diplomatic way but you chose to do it this way. You chose to be an asshole. Did you think that maybe Olivia wanted to go to spend time with her sister who she's been apart from all this time? It's not just about you.", "Soft ESH\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said that, even if true. It\u2019s hard to actually love someone you don\u2019t really know, but people take statements like that to the extreme and it could always get back to Olivia. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting to take a teenager that you and your family barely know to another country with you. You explained why. It was a reasonable explanation too. But Olivia\u2019s mom couldn\u2019t accept that and tried to guilt you into it by playing the familial love card.

Worst this gets for OP is ESH", "Of course it's about the money I don't spend so much money on strangers. It's an oversees trip so it costs a lot", "you are the current problem with social interactions.\n\nYou should not EVER have to watch what you say, especially when its the truth.\n\nGrow up", "You should not be expected to take Olivia. However to show Olivia you're not a monster maybe when you get back invite her to free/cheaper things and start bonding. When she asks why you weren't close before just explain the truth. If her mom hasn't poisoned her mind already she may be willing to bond with you. She may see that her mother put her in this position and that it's nothing personal.", "you are NTA - at all. Everyone who says you are, never have any social interactions and are entitled little idiots", "She's not random. It's still her niece.  I love all mine, even if it's not close.Id never use those words.", "[deleted]", "Bad wording. Now people are going to pile on you calling you cheap. People just love focusing on stuff like that while ignoring the fact you would be responsible for an underage teenage girl who is practically a stranger while in another fucking country. I don\u2019t blame you one bit for not wanting to be in that situation. As long as you make an effort to have a relationship with Olivia now that she\u2019s closer, NTA.", "You do realize that money doesn't equal love, you don't need one to have the other.", "So when you said \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable doing this\u201d you really meant you don\u2019t have the extra money or you don\u2019t want to spend money on it. Lol", "So you\u2019d love your niece if she were available to you easily and without cost to you? Yeah, seems like you love her sister in the way someone loves a doll or accessory to bring around when they feel like it.", "And you could've handled it like an adult and discussed that with her mom instead of saying you don't love your neice. You still suck even if money is the issue.", "You try that in the real world and see how it works out for you.", "Haha have you ever had a human relationship?", "You probably have a lot of growing up to do yourselves. Adults often have to lie to not be an AH", "This is such a reductive, I\u2019m not saying she needs to lie. But pretending it\u2019s necessary to be cruel out of the sake of total honesty is ridiculous, lacks any kind of social awareness. This is the shit that makes me believe Reddit is overrun with people who never actually go outside or just simply children with no actual experience navigating adult relationships. Pretending you should NEVER have to watch what you say is insane, especially on a forum specifically asking who\u2019s an AH: most AH don\u2019t care what they say unless it affects them.", "I asked if telling her mom was ok but if her mom decided to tell her then that is really not my problem that she chose to make her child upset", "But there was no reason on earth she needed to say she didn\u2019t love a child, that\u2019s textbook AH behavior", "That's what I've gathered. It's about money, not the relationship lol.", "It's a rule I live my life by, and I am getting a long fine.\n\nI don't have to turn to reddit for justification in my actions, and be patted on the back every day.\n\nIt's you that needs to step outside to the real world and stop getting your feelings affirmed by other people.", "please explain how your comment is relevant to anything I said. \n\nClearly I have had human relationships? \n\nWhat does that have to do with anything?", "No. \"adults\" don't lie, because they don't give a shit about what people think, if you do, you are a fake person who has no integrity. \n\nBeing able to voice your opinions in a matter of fact manner is one of the defining principles of being an adult.", "I couldn't care what anyone thinks of what I say, but I wouldn't go out my way to be an AH - thats the difference you see.\n\nYou catering for peoples feelings is an issue.", "It's really not. \n\nI have a bunch of relatives that I don't know. If I don't know them, baby, child or adult, how am I supposed to love them?\n\nThe mother literally said you need to love and treat them the same, OP said she can't because she doesn't. \n\nHarsh sure, but from OP's comments it seems like the mother has come back into town and is expecting the family to make up for over a decade of gifts/money and time spent with the other niece with no understanding that that's not how life works \n\nNTA.", "Which why I said soft ESH. Olivia\u2019s mom tried to guilt OP into giving her daughter a free vacation after being told no.", "Well I mean..... yeah?? An international trip isn't cheap. If I had the option of bringing along a distant (emotionally) relative that I see maybe once a year, or not.... I'm sorry, but I'm not. If I was in the financial position to do so, I'd gladly pay for my best friend, for example, or my brother. But not a relative I barely know and seldom see. They can pay for themselves if they want to go that badly.", "Could have said that from the start. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb These people", "Because then you would know you can\u2019t just go around in life speaking to people with no filter.", "I don\u2019t think being considerate within reason, especially when it\u2019s not necessary to be rude is catering for peoples feelings in an unhealthy way. It\u2019s really not much effort to keep your most critical thoughts to a minimum, and when they are needed to be tactful.", "OP has also said the only reason she doesn\u2019t love her is because she moved away from them, and that she doesn\u2019t spend any time with her or make effort because it\u2019s not convenient to them and would cost them money. All the adults in this situation clearly aren\u2019t mature enough to have relationships with children, period. I have a nephew I\u2019ve never met and probably wouldn\u2019t take on vacation if pressured but I\u2019m sure I could think of plenty of things to say outside of \u201cno I can\u2019t because I don\u2019t know him, therefore I don\u2019t love him.\u201d \n\nHaving children in your family that you don\u2019t know, they still probably know you as their aunt. Someone they look up to from afar, it\u2019s really easy to NOT say cruel things about children. It\u2019s also not hard to simply stand your ground, it\u2019s called making adult decisions.", "And OP would have been in the right by saying no if she said it literally any other way, but she chose the most out of pocket nuclear option. Both of the adults in this situation sound childish as fuck.", "yeah this - all these other people commenting are just crazy. They have some emotional issues or something. \n\nNo one in there right mind, would take someone across the world, that they barely know, and have to bare all financial responsibility for, as well as actually being responsible for them.\n\nBunch of entitled morons", "Its always incredible to me how people work so hard to sound like the victim in the post only to completely blow it in the comments.", "She did. Olivia\u2019s mom persisted. But yeah. Both acted poorly.", "Agree, she lost the rightful high ground."]}
