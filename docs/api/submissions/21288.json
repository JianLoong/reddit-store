Harsh yes. But only because you were pushed. \n\nOP said no and that she wasn't comfortable taking older niece first, which is entirely understandable. If I don't know someone well, no matter their age, I don't want to be responsible for them in another country. OP doesn't know if the kid will respect rules, behave themselves etc. \n\nTaking a child overseas and being responsible for them is a lot of work, when they're practically an adult and the same size as you it can be even harder because if they don't want to do something, you can't even pick them up like a screaming toddler to get them on the plane. \n\nThen the mother pushed with a 'you have to love and treat them the same'. First of all life doesn't work like that, and second of all why does she have to love someone she doesn't know? \n\nEveryone on here says blood doesn't make family when people are leaving shitty family situations, but she *must* love her niece that she is just now, getting to know because they're related? The math doesn't math. \n\nAnd people picking on her about not wanting to spend money. OF COURSE she doesn't want to. I'm not wanting to spend what could be in the $5000+, depending on flights accommodation etc, on someone I barely know either, relative or not.", "I'm going to get downvoted for this, but NTA.\n\nYou didn't say you hated or even disliked Olivia. You said *you didn't love her,* which is a fact, and the reason is not that Olivia is inherently unlovable, but because you barely know her. She's almost a stranger to you.\n\nI think that's a reasonable position. I don't love people I don't know, no matter how closely they are related to me.\n\nI'm actually in a similar position to you. I have lots of nieces and nephews. One of my brothers has three children (all now grown up) by three different women. I'll call them A, B, and C.\n\nI hardly ever saw A and B when they were growing up, but C I saw frequently. As a result, I'm much closer to C than I am to A and B, and C did a lot to help me after I became disabled. I saw A and B so little over the years, they can probably barely remember my name, and I'll bet they couldn't pick me out of a police lineup.\n\nI too am thinking of going on an overseas trip in the next couple of years, and I've been toying with the idea of inviting C as a travel companion. It's possible A and B would be upset if they found out. *But I don't know them.* They're almost strangers to me. And I don't want to go on a trip with strangers.\n\n*She said they are both my nieces and I should love and treat them equally.*\n\n\"Love them equally\" is ridiculous. Love is a feeling; you can't help who you love, only how you show it.\n\n\"Treat them equally\" is an argument with slightly more merit, especially if the children are very young. But Olivia is 15, and I'd argue that is old enough to understand that you really can't expect a person to spend a large amount of money on you when they barely know you.", "NTA. She sounds entitled as fuck.", "ESH.  Olivia's mom can ask, but shouldn't demand.  Since your answer is \"No,\" her focus should be on helping Olivia manage her feelings about not going on the trip, not on trying to manipulate you into taking her daughter.  How does she imagine that will end well?\n\nHowever, you could have been nicer and smarter about this, and still have been 100% honest.  How about \"Ofc Olivia is my niece.  However, she's grown up seeing us once a year, so we don't know Olivia well, and she also doesn't really know us.  I wouldn't be comfortable taking her on a long international trip, and I doubt she'd be comfortable either once the initial excitement wears off.  When she gets homesick or tired or lonely, I wouldn't be able to focus just on her with all her cousins to take care of as well, and frankly this is my vacation, too.  Maybe in a few years, when we've gotten to know each other better, things will be different.\"", "NTA. They moved away and although that is not Olivia's fault, the outcome of that is that you don't know her well. She is not entitled to go on the trip with you and your other niece. I wouldn't want to go on a trip to another country with a teenager I barely know and also have to pay for.\n\nHowever, I do think you could have handled it better. Hopefully you won't hold a grudge against Olivia for her mom's actions and give her a chance to bond with you", "NTA you don\u2019t know the girl taking her on vacation is not a good idea. Of course you don\u2019t love her you don\u2019t know her. You\u2019re right if her mom had allowed her to be closer to her family it might be different.", "You could have dealt with it a little less harsh but well truth be told you have no relationship with the other niece and obviously it is uncomfortable, if not slightly dangerous, taking her on a trip. If you wanna have a relation with your niece I would talk with her mom, since they live nearby, to arrange some meetings, trips together to create a bond. And then you will see. NTA.", "It sounds like you discussed the holiday situation in front of Olivia's mum... That is a lil tackless. Her pushing to try and get her daughter involved when she's not allowed a relationship to blossom between you, also tackless. But announcing you do not love her child, did not need to be said. You could have just said \"I barely know her, I'm not comfortable with that, maybe the next holiday when we know her better\". Not \"I do not love her and it's your fault\", as true as it may be, to say it like that is almost like trying to start a fight. No one wins here. You should be asking for time with your niece, to make up for the time you haven't had. It doesn't have to be the holiday, just regular contact.", "ESH\n\nOlivia\u2019s mom should realize the relationship dynamics and not push for inclusion on the trip. However, you could have handled that about 1000x better.", "NTA. I care what anyone says love isn\u2019t an instant thing it takes time to develop. I adore my nephew. I don\u2019t get to see him all that often but when I do he\u2019s sweet and so adorable. You niece and you have no connection so for her mom to just assume she will benefit from this is outrageous", "NTA.  However the timing you announced that you are going on a trip was not right.  You should've done it when Olivia and her mother was not present.  It would've save a lot of explaining to do.  And I think it was unnecessary for you to say that you don't love your other niece.", "Umm did you say that in front of Olivia? Cause then Y T A. If not, then you\u2019re good.", "So it\u2019s a soft YTA . Your correct in not taking Olivia, you don\u2019t know her. I feel like the wording of your response could be better. Instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t love Olivia\u201d which could be really damaging to any future relationship with her and very upsetting for a 15 year old, I probably would have just said \u201cmyself and my children don\u2019t know Olivia, and a trip overseas is not the best way to get to know someone new\u201d\n\nI think what you said was meant to be jarring to Olivia\u2019s mother and honestly she deserved it, but I don\u2019t think Olivia deserves to feel like her extended family is already against her for something that wasn\u2019t her fault.", "You\u2019re kind of an asshole", "You were pretty harsh in how you answered Olivia\u2019s mother. Stating you don\u2019t love your niece pretty much makes you TA. \n\nHowever. You *know* Freya. You know her behaviors, you know whether or not you can safely manage to take her to a (I\u2019m assuming) distant foreign country. You are confident that Freya will be safe in your care while traveling. \n\nYou don\u2019t really know Olivia. How would she behave while traveling? Can you trust that you can safely take care of this minor child on an international trip? You don\u2019t know. \n\nSo, back it up. Apologize to Olivia\u2019s mother for your harsh statements. Because what you said was very harsh. But also tell her that taking her child to a foreign country is not the appropriate time to get to know someone. Spend some time with Olivia at home. Get to know her. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to treat both children equally. But you also don\u2019t need to be so unkind. It\u2019s not Olivia\u2019s fault her mom lived so far away.", "Could\u2019ve left it at the \u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d in my opinion. If you don\u2019t know her, it\u2019s hard to say you do love or not love her.  She is your niece, you should love her even in the absence and distance. \n\nDon\u2019t let the anger for her mother impact your opinion of the daughter.", "INFO why did Olivia's mom move her to another city and limit seeing her only once a year?", "Don't blame a child for their adults mistakes.", "I think that a better thing to say would have been that whether or not you love Olivia isn't the point, the point is that her mother intentionally created a situation in which you barely know Olivia and you don't feel comfortable taking a kid you don't know to Turkey.\n\nSaying you don't love her will undoubtedly get back to Olivia, who is a kid and will feel terribly hurt, not understanding that her mother is responsible for all this, and not even being aware that you tried to call and her mother made even this kind of contact all but impossible.\n\nSo I think you're not at all an A for not taking Olivia with you or for not loving her; you barely know her, \n\nBut YTA for *saying* you don't love her.  There are some true things that it's much better not to say out loud as they can badly hurt children unnecessarily.", "YTA for planning the trip in front of people who weren\u2019t invited.", "ESH. Claiming to love a random kid you barely know just because you happen to be related would be much weirder. Her mother was very inappropriate. However you shouldn't make this sort of comments in front of your niece.", "Man you're nta for not taking a kid you have no relationship with on holiday but jesus christ dude. You know the woman is vindictive so you gave her the perfect ammo to make her kid feel like shit and you look like the bad guy? I feel bad for Olivia because it looks like she won't even have a relationship with you if you can't get past how much you hate her mother.", "Jesus Christ that's harsh. ESH\n\nThat could have been handled much better. Much, much better. With tact and grace. Maybe explaining that you didn't have the same chance to bond with Olivia and you're not comfortable taking her on that trip. Not \"I don't love her\". Good lord. We can be honest without being brutal. Not sure what everyone's obsession with trampling over the feelings of others is all about but some of you need a damn hug. \n\nThe mom should not have asked. That's some entitled AH behavior. \n\nThat poor kid. She's done nothing wrong and will lose out on family because of the actions of adults. \n\nWhy don't you try and develop a relationship now? You could have two amazing nieces and not even know it. Go do something with just Olivia. \n\nBut enjoy your trip with just you and Freya. And maybe show some grace to Olivia. Not her mom. Her mom can f off.", "Are you punishing the ex of your brother but not his current wife?", "Yta.", "YTA. For saying that. Other ways to go about the situation.  I can't fathom reacting that way.

Blaming someone for moving is pretty crummy but acting like you were entitled to the child. \"Took her away from us\" as if she belonged to you? Really gross.

Did you think that maybe Olivia wanted to go to spend time with her sister who she's been apart from all this time? It's not just about you.", "Soft ESH\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said that, even if true. It\u2019s hard to actually love someone you don\u2019t really know, but people take statements like that to the extreme and it could always get back to Olivia. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting to take a teenager that you and your family barely know to another country with you. You explained why. It was a reasonable explanation too. But Olivia\u2019s mom couldn\u2019t accept that and tried to guilt you into it by playing the familial love card.

OP started with the very tactful \"I don't know your daughter and I don't feel comfortable taking her\". It was Olivia's mother who kept pushing.", "Exactly.  The whole thing is weird.  OP and her family don\u2019t seem look good people.", "She\u2019s met Olivia many times. \nI\u2019ve met these family members and don\u2019t talk to them often. I love them because they\u2019re family. It\u2019s natural. They\u2019ll always be loved and treated equally by me, and in MOST families, that\u2019s normal.", "And that\u2019s sick. It was said to hurt the mom and child. That\u2019s it", "Oh man. That is just chefs kiss", "I read in op\u2019s comments that her brother is a cheater. still though, you can hardly expect to isolate your child from someone and then attempt to walk back into their lives demanding they take them on trips and buy and ipad for them", "Yeah, but is your mom demanding these people take you on a trip?", "It doesn't really matter here. OP lived next door to one and wasn't really allowed contact with Olivia by the mom.\n\nThe why doesn't change that.", "It could, but in those situations, you block the cheater, not their entire family. Not unless they're harassing you on behalf of the cheater, anyway.", "But allowing her kid on an unsupervised visit is ok?", "Oh for sure that make her mom an asshole. But she already disallowed communication and tried to guilt OP. So I wouldn\u2019t put it above her", "Sounds like she did exactly that based on the last line of the post.", "This part exactly. And she is leaving out the part where Olivia\u2019s mom probably moved back home for support. She is leaving out some serious details about those 15 years of estrangement.", "Even if that's true, the minor child has nothing to do with that, and OP should love her anyway, whether she lives nearby or on another continent.", "The tone in the post is that the OP doesn't *want* to know Olivia at this point -- she moved away from the cheating brother and now the OP doesn't care about her at all.", "There are facts and then there is how to speak to someone. She didn't say this because it was a fact, she said it to hurt the mum.", "We are retiring here in Alabama for the pure fact we can afford a huge house and a acre. We have been stationed here 2 times. First my husband was here 8 and I lived here 6 of those and the now we have been back since December 2020. My parents moved here from California and know we may get moved but they couldn't afford it any longer and would have not been able to move to another state without help. They were able to get a nice house with a pool and they would never get that there. My sister is still in California but does not want to move despite having a hard time making ends meet, but she will come out to visit.  Haha.", "Spot on.", "I had my suspicions but I didn\u2019t want to judge without hearing it from OP. Given the circumstances OP is YTA. And any resentment she has at not being in Olivia\u2019s life should be directed at her brother, not her niece and her niece\u2019s  mom", "The question is, was he even dating these girls? Or was he seeing one, and a few months later started another relationship.", "no, its not.\n\nonce a year for 15 years.\n\n\"Many\"", "It was the hardest \"refrain from saying I told you so\" moment I've ever had", "Agreed, and if you want to block the rest of the family as well, go ahead, but don\u2019t expect shit from them right away when you pop back into their lives 15 years later.", "But it sounds like she'd never have gone there if Olivia's mom had accepted the no she'd gotten to involving Olivia. \n\nYou don't get to push someone on why they're saying No (it's a complete sentence and all that) and then act all hurt when they end up snapping. \n\nOP tried to be polite and not inflammatory. Ex sil pressed.", "The ex was persisting and OP drove the facts home. It also does not say the child was present. I think she was blunt but not rude. Her space and boundaries were infringed and she told her why they were being infringed.", "OP admitted in a comment that their brother cheated on Olivia\u2019s mom", "Even less than I\u2019ve spent with these family members that are much younger than her 15 year old niece. And she spoke to her on the phone. All of these details are vague, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s for a reason."]}
