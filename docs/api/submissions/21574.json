I was in remission until a few months ago, and now I'm back in therapy, and that's okay. One meal, one workout at a time. \n\nI manage my neurodivergency by having a set routine I do (I work from home, which is an enormous benefit) every day. \n\nI manage my PTSD a variety of ways, too, for example, I have noise canceling headphones and a set July 4 plan to keep me inside and functional. \n\nI manage my eating disorder by going back to therapy, powerlifting, positive self talk, relying on my partner (because ding ding, I'm NOT saying you shouldn't help him, partner support is crucial), taking it one meal at a time, and watching YouTube content that most people don't know exists and would horrify them if they did. \n\nMy point is that while all those things can overwhelm me, **and I'm not always successful in coping (or even close),** I have **taken the time to try to adapt to my brain's wacky process.**\n\nBecause that's what *adults* do. \n\nAnd believe you me, I am *constantly* aware of what a burden this can be to my partner, even though he doesn't perceive it that way. \n\nAnd because of that, I go *out of my way* to try and cope and manage because *I'm an adult with children and a partner who need me and love me.* \n\nAnd your partner isn't making that effort, leaving you with all the burden of his ADHD. \n\nAnd that's what a *young* child does - leaves you with all the burden of their problems while making little effort to assist in coping. \n\nAlso, I'd fucking love a colorful star chart, because I fucking love cleaning AND feeling rewarded, so maybe I'm biased.\n\nYour partner isn't incapable of coping, he's **weaponizing incompetence.** \n\nHe ate and had clean laundry before you, he got to work before you, etc. \n\nNow he wants you to be his mom and refuses to manage his disorder. \n\nSo yeah, child's chore chart seems about appropriate to me.", "NTA.

It would make my life so much easier, even more so since someone else made it!\n\nI understand him getting stressed out by the \"amount\" of chores that need doing, but come on. If I forget to do a very important chore (e.g. buy groceries and cook dinner) you know what I would do when someone reminded me? I would apologise profusely and do it!\n\nOP, when you remind your BF that he hasn't done a certain chore (that you already asked him to do), does he do it then/apologise/do it within the next hour? How does he rectify his mistake?", "NTA. He clearly just wants you to do everything with no changes on his part. You could have made the most professional adult chore chart in existence and he'd find a way to call it emasculating because he doesn't want to do anything, period. \n\nIt's so funny to me it's emasculating to make the chore chart cute but not manipulative and \"motherizing\" you when he doesn't do his fair share of the housekeeping. He's doing a *great* job of reversing victim and offender. \n\nPersonally, I'd break up and move out. Emotionally immature people take years and years to change, if ever. I heavily doubt he's going to grow up in time to be the partner you deserve.", "NTA. People use ADHD to excuse any kind of behavior. I have ADHD and I can remember to finish laundry and grocery shop and all kinds of things. Nip this in the bud. You shouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for everything because he can\u2019t remember. Think long and hard about the future- are you going to marry and have kids with him?

I have struggled with this, as well as other mental health issues which at times I've found debilitating. Putting myself reminders didn't stress me out.

I was gonna rule otherwise because of how childish you made it but in the comments I see that wasn't your first resort.", "You are not his mom, NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis is so odd to read as someone with really bad ADHD who leans the opposite way of your boyfriend. I have issues knowing when to stop cleaning. I have absolutely been guilty of the laundry in the washing machine for two days, but everything else? Nah. I do more than my part in this house. My family would absolutely say I do the vast majority of cleaning and organising, *because* I can't focus in a disorganized environment. The main difference between me and your boyfriend is that I'm a woman. There's no widely accepted social construct that would let me get away with making my partner my parent.

My partner needs an outside deadline: \u201cby time I get home\u201d, for example. He\u2019ll get it done ten minutes before it needs to be done but darn it, it\u2019s done. I also need outside pressure, which is why I do well at work. \u201cX has to be done by Y\u201d, etc. I\u2019m great at it! I have a daily routine. \n\nIf he\u2019s fine at work and can\u2019t manage at home\u2026what was he doing BEFORE you? You are not his therapist, his nanny, or his maid. If he\u2019s not going to step up and find methods that work for him, it\u2019s not a relationship you want to sink time into. \n\nIf I need to focus, I\u2019ll put on shows I hate, because I will do ANYTHING not to pay attention to them\u2026including fold laundry. \n\nHe either needs professional help to find tools that work for him, or he needs to implement what he was doing before you. Either way, this is on him.", "Shocked by the votes here and all the suggestions for what you should do to help him differently. Managing his disability is his responsibility, not yours.

ADHD or not, he's acting childish by not taking responsibility to help himself. Sounds like you've tried everything else and desperate times call for desperate measures. \n\nTrust me on this, my ex was exactly like this. I spent 6 years around your same age dealing with same behavior. He will not change if he is unwilling to change. The only change you can make is your living situation and relationship status.", "NTA.\n\nHe's humiliating himself by not managing his condition's impact on you.", "NTA! I\u2019m so sick and tired of people using their ADHD as an excuse to be a fuckin slob! I also have ADHD and lists and charts are my whole life! Because if I don\u2019t, **I WILL FORGET!** He might be mad cuz he\u2019s been lazy and used to getting away with using his ADHD as an excuse.

What did he do before he lived with you?\n\nFor me it comes down to whether he is trying or not. If he isn't trying anything and is just expecting you to do everything or live in chaos then you wouldn't be the asshole (or maybe a bit of an asshole but somewhat justified) but if he is genuinely trying different things and is still struggling then yeah, I feel like you are being an asshole.\n\nETA - From your answers it's clearly NTA, as he isn't trying and just expecting you to almost take care of him. I think it would benefit him significantly if he lived by himself so he was forced to deal with the consequences of not doing this stuff. And it would be a lot better for you not to live with him.", "NTA - if this was actually ADHD, I would understand, but this sounds more like weaponized incompetence. He doesn't have these problems completing tasks at work.", "You wouldn't have to treat him like a child if he didn't act like one. His ADHD might explain why he forgets but it's not an excuse to continue to forget. He needs to do SOMETHING that'll help him remember. You signed up to be a partner, not a mom, not a bangmaid. \n\nIf he finds the chore chart humiliating, he should find that treating his partner like a mom would be humiliating. Would he prefer you complain about this among your friends because you could totally shame him into doing his part but you're nice enough to keep this private for now. NTA", "NTA. You need to look up \u201cweaponized incompetence.\u201d You\u2019re only 20 don\u2019t let some loser turn you into his live in mommy that he sleeps with.", "NTA.   My son and partner both have ADHD and there are definitely challenges in many areas - but the thing is, they both work to find ways to work with me alongside their ADHD.   Mostly that means taking responsibility and saying this works for me, that doesn't work for me please don't do that.   There has been a lot of trial and error, especially as alongside just not noticing things or getting distracted there is a real hump to get over of 'just getting started' as things build up to the point they just are too much of a mental hurdle to even tackle.     So, things like body doubling help.   But, the thing is they work to try to find things to help themselves and let me help them.\n\nSo whilst your childish one may be a bit petty, it sounds like you've done all the emotional work here to try and help them and they have done nothing.   If they are genuinely frustrated with themselves (and that's why none of the other ideas have worked), they are an adult - they need to step up and say look that's not helping, can we try XYZ instead.", "NTA! This not ADHD - this is weaponized incompetence. Not only does he not help you - he makes your life objectively more difficult.  I bet if he lived on his own he would remember to buy and cook food. If it was his ADHD he would take steps to manage it rather then ignore your efforts to help.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s telling you where you fit into his life. If you were important to him, he would find a way.  Instead, he\u2019s just weaponizing his incompetence.

I am in the same position as well and also get frustrated. We\u2019ve tried everything and I do feel for him because he gets just as frustrated with himself. We\u2019ve had a conversation about avoiding the \u201clater\u201d response as much as possible. I don\u2019t want to be the nagging wife that repeats the same things over and over. I\u2019ve essentially become a human calendar and reminder app. \n\nI think making the chart without discussing it may have offended him in an understanding way. Perhaps if you mentioned it beforehand he wouldn\u2019t have been so shocked. Either way, you\u2019re trying to find a solution so I don\u2019t blame you at all.\n\nEdit to add: Reminds me of Phil in that one episode of Modern Family when he went to change the lightbulb \ud83d\ude02", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe's not willing to fix himself, so you shouldn't feel obligated to fix him, either.", "You're N T A for wanting a chore chart, but you're certainly YTA for choosing \"the most childish one you could\" rather than simply picking one because you liked it or because you thought it was the most practical.\n\nAnd it's all so unnecessary!

Yeah, I\u2019d be insulted too. However, if he is, as you say in a comment, unwilling to change, then you need to decide if you can live with it and be honest with him.

But it's also frustrating to come home at 8 pm only to find out I still need to buy groceries and cook, cuz he forgot. Or to want to do laundry, only to find out his wet laundry has been in the machine for 4 days.

Do you end up rewashing them or do you chuck them into a basket and let him know that AFTER you finish your laundry he'll need to rewash his?   When he leaves the milk out do you just pitch it and buy more OR do you make him go out and replace it.  \n\nRight before Covid  my husband's niece with ADHD (whom I adore) came to live with us.

So don't leave yourself out of finding them together.", "While true, that should be a discussion. Condescending charts is not a discussion, it's toxic af", "Because the chart is the most childish one she could have possibly made. The intention is clearly there to piss him off. That's not about helping him, that's just being toxic back. I not excusing his behaviour, but I'm not about to ignore the fact that the way she dealt with it here was childish and definitely an AH move.", "Yes there are. Have you read any of them?\nMost of the clowns here don\u2019t seem to have a clue and they have adhd apparently.\n\nYou could at least do the bare minimum and learn about it.", "We tried a bunch of different things, then eventually we just sucked it up and hired a cleaner. Now our cleaner holds us accountable, we tidy up together in preparation for her to show up and she does the heavy lifting for us.", "I will admit hiring a cleaner has helped us immensely. We fight a lot less, now our main focus is laundry, ensuring whomever cooks the other does the dishes, and our cats.", "People who can redirect my monologue back to the original point are miraculous, and I love them.", "i think you just created it! i\u2019ll definitely be using this lol", "I disagree about the work thing. There's a theory that the ADHD brain requires different motivation than the NT brain. With ADHD, what works is novelty, interest, challenge, or urgency. I'm guessing at work he has at least two of these going for him. At home, wrt chores, he doesn't. The thing is, he needs to recognize that it's a serious problem and take steps to improve. That he resists doing so makes him TA. OP is NTA.", "That's one of those absurd things and used to delegitimize the experience of very many people with ADHD. Being able to focus when you love something does not mean that you suddenly don't have ADHD. I have severe crippling ADHD but I still love my job and often end up in hyperfocus status during work days. I get so absorbed in what I'm doing that I need to have alarms to remind me that I have to actually eat or that I need to physically check into my body to see if I need to eat or drink. ADHD isn't the problem here. It's the person's unwillingness to deal with the effects of it. OP is NTA bit there's no reason to attempt to diagnose based on your unique personal experience.", "It isn't an excuse, like OP's boyfriend is using it, and I agree about him weaponizing his incompetence. That's a great way to say that.\n\nTo the work piece, he might have a job that fits the ADHD style of operating. A lot of ADHD people are successful professionally and a mess at home.", "Even taking the ADHD aspects out of it, using lists and systems to keep yourself organized is one of those habits that leads to being a more successful person. It basically removes the mental energy of having to keep track of stuck in your head and allows you to use that energy more productively.\n\nThe most basic example is that if you run out of something, you put it on a grocery list and then refer to the list when you\u2019re at the store. The whole point is so that you won\u2019t be at the store, having to remember something.\n\nOr for chores, it takes away the \u201cmental load\u201d of remembering all that needs doing. No need to worry about that, just do the tasks", "I think my mom and I both have  undiagnosed ADHD, and I have now stated copying the way she organized her household tasks. Each day of the week is assigned one major errand or cleaning  task, and that way I don\u2019t forget to do laundry or get groceries, and I don\u2019t get overwhelmed on my day off trying to clean the whole house, bc  i deep clean one room per day. Also certain tasks are assigned a timeframe. It doesn\u2019t always work: I forgot to take my 6:30AM walk today, but at least it keeps me somewhat organized", "Honestly \u201cchildish\u201d color coding and eye-catching images help me as well. But if someone made such a chart independently because they\u2019d reached their limit with my habits, the fact that they felt they needed to do that would be an issue. People with ADHD feel a lot of shame over their habits. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s lashing out because of that. But the key isn\u2019t to rationalize your behavior and make excuses. He needs to swallow his pride and realize that there\u2019s no shame in doing whatever is necessary to be a considerate partner. If he\u2019s not on medication, he should consider it. It changed my life.", "Nothing childish about taking responsibility and doing what needs to get done.", "[removed]", "Right? And one of the things that sucks about ADHD is that depression is a common co-morbidity so then you need to deal with depression decreasing your ability to initiate tasks even more. \n\nWhat I like about these charts is that it gives me something to check off and I can feel like I actually did something.", "Dude you stole my comment \ud83d\udc80\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t9cfw/aita_for_making_a_very_childish_chore_chart_for/jr18vqb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", "I do Notes on my phone nowadays, though I used to use sticky notes.  Now I have Grocery List, Chores List, and a whole host of other things.  The moment I think of it, I add it to the list and I compulsively check every morning to make sure I haven't forgotten something.  Honestly, I'd never remember what to do if it weren't for lists.", "I PLAY THOSE GAMES, TOO!!!  That's my biggest trick when it comes to procrastination or large tasks - just do one thing.  Just pick up the clothes and put them in the hamper. Just take a shower.  Just pull up the Excel spreadsheet for taxes. Just wash one dish.", "I might try that app, it sounds really useful.  I like that it's gamified.", "Yup. \"later\" is never.  \n\n\nHe needs to be told \"not later, now. You never do it later. So do it now.\"", "The alarms for everyday things we \u201cshould\u201d remember are such a life-saver! Out of sight out of mind is such a thing with ADHD", "Yeah, I have lists on my pantries and fridge so I know what\u2019s in there because I will literally not remember if I don\u2019t actively see it. For me, the issue isn\u2019t \u201cpeople using ADHD as an excuse,\u201d but that the boyfriend isn\u2019t even trying. \n\nADHD can be debilitating for some people (like me lol) and I\u2019m frustrated with how Reddit has this idea that anyone who has a serious case is just lazy and using it as an excuse, *but* if you live with another person, you are responsible for doing your best to carry your weight. If the boyfriend made himself the chart and asked OP for input on things he might have forgotten to put on it, that\u2019s trying. If the boyfriend is just expecting her to do everything for him, that\u2019s a problem.", "Playing into negative stereotypes about the neurodivergent won\u2019t get him to be better, it\u2019ll just give OP catharsis. \n\nIf you want him to get better, get angry when he doesn\u2019t do what he said he will", "He doesn\u2019t have a debilitating disease and is able to move. Doing half the work when you\u2019re physically capable of doing it is an expectation you should have. And yes, I understand mental health. I have three mental health disorders.", "Like getting mad, or refusing to do anything for him, stuff like that", "Wow, this is spot on!!", "SO. MUCH. THIS. The only thing you can count on in this scenario is his willingness TO NOT CHANGE. Kick his butt out or leave yourself.", "Honestly, I do think there are some benefits to it, but I don't feel like mentioning them at the moment.  Heh.", "This is what I said in my comment!", "Exactly. It was the pettiness of the childish chart that was the problem. If she'd even asked if she were the asshole for dumping him over chores, that would have been fine. \n\nBut this sub LOVES pettiness. Ugh.", "Eww no. That\u2019s basically selling your body in exchange for *basic* adult behaviour from your partner. Huge yikes and nope.", "So OP sucks for... having basic expectations of her boyfriend?", "*OP* has so little respect for *him*?\n\nHe isn\u2019t making a single effort to help in the household, and keeps saying he \u201ccan\u2019t help it.\u201d Meanwhile he has no issue remembering non-chore related stuff. \n\nHe\u2019s made it very clear he doesn\u2019t give a shit if his partner has to do everything to keep a household running. OP is at the end of her rope. And you seriously think *she* has so little respect for *him*?\n\nI have to believe you\u2019re just like the boyfriend, because no one else would view this so ignorantly.", "I agree they don't have to be and can be helpful! But it doesn't feel like 'we' are trying anything. It feels like I'm trying everything, and he's okay with not trying. \n\nThe childish chart was pretty, but it was done in a moment of frustration after doing my chores, reminding him of chores, trying to find ways to help him remember chores, and doing most of his chores.", "Agreed. But that was after trying to discuss, reward, remind, and find other ways to manage. For three months I've been doing 05% of the housework, as well as trying to find ways that would help him remember. While he hasn't put in effort to try and find solutions. It was my breaking point.", "Hmmm I see what you mean. One could argue that it was her breaking point but she also needs to sit and re-evaluate what she wants with this relationship. Him being as unhelpful and uncooperative as possible, and her finally being exhausted into pettiness is breeding grounds for resentment. If you love your partner you can't continue refusing to pull your weight or attempt to, and you can't try and one-up your partner either. The two need to talk it out properly. Lay all your cards on the table, OP, and openly ask BF to do the same. Discuss what's bothering you about him, how you snapped in the end because of the mental stress, and while the action might have been motivated by anger, you really do want to try and find something that works for the both of you, but he needs to put in his share of effort. Any good couple knows its not them vs the partner, but them vs the problem. If he refuses to do so, well, you can certainly predict how your relationship might end up.", "The edits always get me too.", "That's kind of the problem/the point. He doesn't consider chores (and how they impact his partner) as urgent or important.", "Hm. I need a career change then. My office space is a giant mess of notes, checklists, and charts everywhere (both paper and digital). Urgency and cycling through multiple things every few minutes are the only things that lets me get anything done.", "We have a shared grocery list on our phones. Google keep notes is awesome! Updates in real time. \n\nI'll shout out \"secretary take a note!\" If my hands are full and he'll add what we need.\n\nIt's great for remembering what to pack/bring to places", "We don't all experience the same ADHD. One of the things that I eternally struggle with are groceries I just can't manage for the life of me to either update or read my grocery list and even if I do i find grocery stores so overwhelming that I just miss items on my list. Or sometimes I also double purchase stuff because on impulse I bought part of the list the other day, forgot about it and I end up wasting.\n\nI've successfully managed a warehouse for a time so I know there are workarounds and methods. But it's just that I saddly don't have the energy to make everything in my life fully functional.", "I just started doing the same thing and it's been great for me! I am diagnosed with ADHD and the \"one room a day\" works really well for me so I don't get overwhelmed and burnt out from a full day of cleaning", "As a person with ADHD, I have had to come up with ways that work for me.  I have lists and checklists that get me through the workday.  At home I try to clean as I go, and my SO has learned that I appreciate it when he reminds me to complete a task that I abandoned due to distractions.  It can be frustrating for him to have to remind me, but after it happens a few times I can usually come up with a workaround.  It sounds like he is using his ADHD to avoid tasks.", "It sounds likes using his ADHD as an excuse for weaponized incompetence.", "Yes I have my own chore list like this where I colored it by day and chore type. At the same time, having adhd makes my executive function really awful and I can struggle to do things even if I know I need to do them and want to do them. Its not always a \"won't \". I will sit on the couch and stare at the chore that needs done literally not doing anything else and I just cannot do it. Its a brain problem and I think too many people label it as \"lazy\" when that isnt what is happening at all.\n\nIt diesnt really sound like boyfriend is trying but we are only seeing it from her point of view. I try very hard but have still left laundry in the washing machine or milk on the counter.", "This shame side to adhd is bullshit.  Most have shame when the fail at something.  It should be pushed by society you are an ass for not being responsible for yourself.  Some ppl can\u2019t achieve this and they may get a pass.   Most though can and choose to use it as an excuse.", "They don't just give out adhd medication. They think people want to use it or sell it and if they don't consistently visit a doctor they won't give that kind of help.", "It's a Fucking bot.", "That's the trick to ADHDer's, being cognizant of the fact that later turns into never.  If you know your behavior, you can start teaching yourself to avoid it. \n\nIf I ask my son for something, he jumps right up and does it because he knows there is a chance he'll forget if he leaves it for later. Yeah, he forgets things, his attention to detail isn't the greatest. But his motivation is what matters.", "I have the issue that phone notifications do absolutely nothing for me. I swipe away the notification/turn of the alarm and 2 seconds later I've already forgotten about it.\n\nI am very structured with lists and things for work. I am successful with my job. I still have an extremely hard time keeping things organized at home. I wish I could find a system that works for me. I LOVE the idea of being overly organized. I want it so bad. I just haven't figured out what works at home, yet.", "OP is NOT her boyfriend mom and is NOT responsible for parenting him.\n\nOP is an adult and her partner is also an adult, but he is not taken responsibility of doing anything to improve but throwing temper tantrums and whining like a child. \n\nNTA but I sincerely hope OP rethink this relationship and moving together because is more than obvious that OP boyfriend is nowhere near ready to live with a partner without being treated like a child who's mommy has to run behind cleaning his mess.", "And what good will getting angry do? He'll say he's sorry, perhaps step up for a bit, and then go back to his old ways, and the cycle repeats itself.", "Getting mad, refusing to do anything will only affect HER not him so it\u2019s like she\u2019d be punishing herself. He\u2019s acting childish so she responded in kind. I don\u2019t have much sympathy for people who act like he\u2019s acting. Dealing with my ADHD is something I struggle with every single day but I do what I have to do to deal with it and work with it to live my life the best I can or else I\u2019d be like this guy.", "Yes!", "Know what might actually work? Packing a bag for him if it's your apartment or for you if it's his. If he wants to be babied and not do anything, send him back to his parents until he's mature enough for an adult relationship. If it's his apartment then you find somewhere to stay because you are not going to be responsible for mothering a grown man that wants to be lazy, inconsiderate, and live in filth. Likely, after a week or two he'll realize that he is not going to get by acting like he does if he actually wants a relationship with you or you will realize that you don't have to have him to be happy. NTA but be willing to put your foot down and stop catering to him or to either pack up or put him out depending on who's apartment it is.", "Question\u2026. How do you see this working long term?  If you have children with him?\n\nHe needs to live in his own for a bit. He went from mom to you doing everything for him", "Ok, why make a child a chore chart if there's no reward at the end? Sorry for thinking of sex... I thought I was helping make the chart seem less childish but if the chart isn't supposed to be helpful beyond making a point I can see how rewarding your partner with sex is a terrible concept and only works in marriages where the problem isn't as much of a turn off.", "A basic expectation might be not have someone that loves you create a toxic child chart to humiliate you.", "Yeah, I definitely think he should play his part and it's obvious he isn't. I just find the childish chore chart to be more hurtful than productive. Dude maybe needs meds (wet clothes in the laundry and leaving the milk out is imo more than just regular forgetfulness) but that doesn't mean he should be embarrassed by his partner. Tit for tat is just a harsh way to coexist.\n\nStill though, he gotta pull his weight or he gets the boot.", "How much mess is he making, seem fucking nuts did he move in and you like thought.. woohoo finally I don\u2019t need to do stuff for myself anymore..? I can offload to my \u201cpartner\u201d whilst humiliating him. Yet you haven\u2019t even bothered to understand what add is and are still suggesting he just \u201ctry harder\u201d", "If it was your breaking point you wouldn't still be living together. Being toxic isn't going to resolve anything. It's only going to make things worse. I'm not saying he's right, but what you did was still wrong. If you're not happy with the living arrangements, leave. The world doesn't need yet another toxic relationship", "Yes.", "I do 15 minutes power sessions. Clean as much as I can in 15 minutes. Generally that's enough to keep my bedroom bathroom and office nice, but I need a second power session sometimes for the living room and kitchen.", "Could be, and that frustrates me to no end! People who do that create a false stereotype.", "You do realize that this pushing only works until someone breaks, and then they're fucked, because without the shame, they have no other strategies to go and get shit done? And let me tell you, it's not pretty when the shame stops working. That's life-destroying, people-killing shit.", "People with ADHD have EXTRA shame on top of the shame everyone experiences. It\u2019s not an excuse but to say the shame side is \u201cbullshit\u201d erases the struggles we go through. Telling someone \u201cyou\u2019re an ass\u201d has never worked in conflicts like this. If you don\u2019t believe in ADHD or know nothing about it, say that. \n\nHere\u2019s my take summarized: sometimes shit happens (like having ADHD) but then it\u2019s YOUR shit and you have to deal with it. It IS harder to do things with ADHD. Just like it\u2019s harder to read when you have dyslexia. It doesn\u2019t mean you can shirk societal standards surrounding how to behave, but he\u2019s not a shitty person for being bad at this stuff, he had a shitty reaction, and if he continues to refuse to change, that would make him shitty.", "Um yeah? Obviously he\u2019ll have to get a formal diagnosis if he doesn\u2019t have one, and see a doctor regularly. I\u2019m not saying he should take a lil trip to the medication store and grab it off the shelf lol", "Ok sure, but helping your partner improve is part of dating, if you don\u2019t want to then just leave. You don\u2019t have to play into this kind of shitty stereotype. It won\u2019t help him and was not done in good faith, if anything this will make it worse. He needs a reality check but that\u2019s when you sit him down and tell him that you can\u2019t keep dating him if he stays like this", "Idk man I struggle with it hard and honestly disappointing my partner made me really wanna get better, I was never this bad but I got pretty bad. Getting at least pretty upset at him or seriously sitting him down and yelling him that you need him to change or you\u2019re gonna have to bail would be a real wake up call and wouldn\u2019t infantalize or antagonize him. As much as it\u2019d be fair to do that if OP wants him to get better this isn\u2019t the way to do it \n\nI also don\u2019t see how not cooking for him or something would hurt her? Idk I never got bad enough to need that but it seems fair to only do your share and to let him languish a bit", "You made the assumption that she didn't try anything on an adult level despite her original post saying she did(even if it just said they had talked about it, yknow, like adults). This sub has a INFO ruling for this reason exactly. If youre not sure what the conversations entailed, ask. I'm not surprised you're being down voted when your initial verdict is still the same after knowing better.", "I actually wasn\u2019t objecting to the \u201crewarding him with sex\u201d bit, I was pointing out that bf is literally not a child. Suggesting alternative ways OP can manage him and hand-hold him through doing his chores is doing OP a massive disservice because *it\u2019s not OP\u2019s job and she shouldn\u2019t have to do it at all.* Rewarding an adult man for doing the stuff every other adult has to do in order to run their households is gross no matter what the reward is.", "How is a childish chart toxic? If he's constantly refusing to use anything to better himself and continues to use his ADHD as a crutch for everything. He 10000% deserves the childish chore chart. He's a grown man that clearly can't take care of himself and is willing to put no effort to better himself. No one's going to be cleaning after him his whole life.", "Sounds like the boyfriend is the one that needs to do some research. Whatever he's trying (if anything) isn't working.

What, I assumed that there was nothing I should be assuming?\n\nShould we just always assume OP is right and just leaving out the details why? Is that how this sub works?\n\nYou seemed reasonable at first but now you're being ridiculous.", "She already provided a children's chore chart as an attempt to correct behavior, so that's where she's at, that's the behavior shes trying to justify, but I really just offhandedly commented using sex as a motivator.   It would work for my lazy husband but I totally agree that was shitty advice.  I wouldn't have recommended it to my daughter, I removed it.  Honestly rereading it kinda grossed me out too.", "Yeah but they don\u2019t seem to of actually just told him that if this keeps going she\u2019s done. Doing this was not only kinda playing into ableist stereotypes but will absolutely only make stuff worse. If they\u2019d only done the chart I\u2019d agree that they\u2019re fully in the right, that\u2019d be a thoughtful and genuine effort to help him.

That's why I didn't. You claim I did, but I didn't.\n\nI simply responded fairly to the post as it was written at the time."]}
