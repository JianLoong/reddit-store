Now, he has ADHD, so noticing when things have to be done and actually doing them are a bit of a struggle for him. \n\nNow, I sympathise. I realise it might be difficult. But it's also frustrating to come home at 8 pm only to find out I still need to buy groceries and cook, cuz he forgot. Or to want to do laundry, only to find out his wet laundry has been in the machine for 4 days. Or wanting a quick bowl of cereal for breakfast, but having to skip it because he forgot to put the milk back in the fridge. Having to do his chores / fix something he started is a daily occurance. \n\nWhen he moved in we devided chores 50/50, I let him pick the ones he liked, and I do the rest. But he's not doing his part. We talked about it several times, but he always says he just forgets or doesn't see it. I suggested he download an app that'll send him reminders, but he thinks the reminders would only stress him out. \n\nSo I made him a chore chart. The most childish one I could, with bright colours and smiley faces for completed tasks. I hung it up on the fridge. And well.. he's pissed. He thinks I'm an AH for 'humiliating him like this' (no one but us has seen it). \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: this wasn't a first resort. I tried lists, notes, checklists, apps, reminding him in person. If I remind him when we're home he'll say 'later', I'll remind him again, 'later', I do the dishes that were \"soaking\" in the sink for 5 days, and he'll get mad at *me* because 'he was just about to get to that'. He also doesn't seem to struggle with remembering things or completing tasks at work.", "created_utc": 1688741230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t9cfw/aita_for_making_a_very_childish_chore_chart_for/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have made the most professional adult chore chart in existence and he'd find a way to call it emasculating because he doesn't want to do anything, period. \n\nIt's so funny to me it's emasculating to make the chore chart cute but not manipulative and \"motherizing\" you when he doesn't do his fair share of the housekeeping. He's doing a *great* job of reversing victim and offender. \n\nPersonally, I'd break up and move out. Emotionally immature people take years and years to change, if ever.

My family would absolutely say I do the vast majority of cleaning and organising, *because* I can't focus in a disorganized environment. The main difference between me and your boyfriend is that I'm a woman. There's no widely accepted social construct that would let me get away with making my partner my parent.

My partner needs an outside deadline: \u201cby time I get home\u201d, for example. He\u2019ll get it done ten minutes before it needs to be done but darn it, it\u2019s done.

My son and partner both have ADHD and there are definitely challenges in many areas - but the thing is, they both work to find ways to work with me alongside their ADHD.   Mostly that means taking responsibility and saying this works for me, that doesn't work for me please don't do that.   There has been a lot of trial and error, especially as alongside just not noticing things or getting distracted there is a real hump to get over of 'just getting started' as things build up to the point they just are too much of a mental hurdle to even tackle.     So, things like body doubling help.   But, the thing is they work to try to find things to help themselves and let me help them.\n\nSo whilst your childish one may be a bit petty, it sounds like you've done all the emotional work here to try and help them and they have done nothing.

It's called executive dysfunction. We say \"we forgot\" because it's easier to say that than try and explain to neurotypicals the concept of executive dysfunction.

But it's also frustrating to come home at 8 pm only to find out I still need to buy groceries and cook, cuz he forgot. Or to want to do laundry, only to find out his wet laundry has been in the machine for 4 days. Or wanting a quick bowl of cereal for breakfast, but having to skip it because he forgot to put the milk back in the fridge. Having to do his chores / fix something he started is a daily occurance. \n\nWhen he moved in we devided chores 50/50, I let him pick the ones he liked, and I do the rest. But he's not doing his part. We talked about it several times, but he always says he just forgets or doesn't see it. I suggested he download an app that'll send him reminders, but he thinks the reminders would only stress him out. \n\nSo I made him a chore chart. The most childish one I could, with bright colours and smiley faces for completed tasks. I hung it up on the fridge. And well.. he's pissed. He thinks I'm an AH for 'humiliating him like this' (no one but us has seen it). \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I made a chore list for my husband with adhd and it didn't stick. Maybe something with brighter colors that is an actual chart will work. \n\nAdhd makes relationships very very very difficult and he seems like he is using it as a crutch and not willing to do the work to handle it. I am open to talk to you about it in pm as the  partner of someone going through the same thing. \n\nAgain..nta but definitely this is going to continue if he doesn't start putting in the work to manage his adhd...that is if he wants to. He may not want to...some are ok with the mothering...and if that's the case..you need to decide if that is the life you want.", "YTA. Yes, he should be pulling his weight but you made it a point to mock him and show him he is being \"childish\" and needs to be treated as such. A conversation addressing your concerns AND building a chart for him/together that can best effectively divide those tasks would have been more productive.", "NTA\n\nWeaponized incompetence at its finest. I\u2019d honestly question if this relationship works for you long term as this is not something he\u2019ll improve on by how he\u2019s acting. \n\nhttps://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/", "Unless you want to raise your boyfriend forever, \n\nit's time that he either tells you how he is going to manage it and actually follow through \n\nor\n\nHe moves back out", "Are you dating my ex-boyfriend? Because this is exactly him. He was autistic (diagnosed Asperger\u2019s but I think that\u2019s a controversial term now) and to say he struggled with organisation was a huge understatement. His messiness was off the charts - he would leave leftover food just sat there at his place till it was infested with maggots. He would resist doing laundry till he ran out of pants and would just go commando. He never really thanked me for sorting his life out all the time for him because he just saw it as I\u2019m good at this and he\u2019s bad at it. \n\nI dumped him, I grew to resent him always being a hot mess and the feeling that he was holding me back in life with his complete lack of ambition and basic life skills. Unless you want a lifetime of doing chores yourself with a partner who has no desire to try to do better (because it doesn\u2019t sound like yours wants to change) then I\u2019d suggest moving on. I have friends with ADHD who find ways to stay on top of their shit, it isn\u2019t an excuse", "NTA, obviously, but also-- \n\nAm I the only ADHD person that unironically loves chore charts? I can understand if a partner doesn't like them--they shouldn't be in charge of household management by default, and I can't imagine it's fun/sexy to treat your partner like a child. But I don't find it condescending as a concept. I like stickers and shiny things. Stickers and shiny things spark more joy than routine ever will, and having specific tasks written up makes them less overwhelming and more likely to get done than thinking \"omg I should \\[clean the bathroom, spring clean, etc.\\]\"\n\nEspecially when he's rejected every other solution on the planet. I get it. ADHD is so fucking frustrating. I struggle every day to make sure I'm not giving into weaponizing incompetence, even if the incompetence is real. It's embarrassing when I fail. I don't want to treat my partner that way.  \n\nYour partner needs to step up or find professional support. You are not his housekeeper.", "Most of this is just laziness not ADHD! I have ADHD and I will forget things, it's like out of sight out of mind... But when somebody says you need to do this now I don't say later, I do it now!

You're NTA but he is", "NTA. I have ADHD and it doesn\u2019t excuse me from being accountable for stuff (and I love a reward chart!). \n\nIs he at peace with his adhd? If not, I can understand why this got him angry.", "NTA,  \n\nI also have ADHD and PTSD.  \n\nIt helps me if I have someone to help me stay focused.  For example if I am washing dishes and someone is talking to me my mind doesn\u2019t wander.  If I am alone, then I am easily distracted.

If he has no trouble remembering work details or going out/\"fun\" stuff, point this out to him. He cares about those things but obviously doesn't care about doing his fair share at home. Tell him either he has to pitch in or else, and then stop helping him. If his wet laundry has been sitting in the washer for days, dump it on the floor. It probably needs to be rewashed anyway but that's his problem. If he leaves a pile of dishes in the sink, wash only what you need - one plate, one fork, one knife, etc. If he forgot to go to the store, fix yourself a can of soup and a sandwich and let him fend for himself. ADHD is no excuse, this is weaponized incompetence.", "I've met people who weaponize their ADHD to excuse bad behavior.

NTA he's not even trying", "NTA,\n\nHe\u2019s just lazy and is using his ADHD as an excuse to have you do everything for him. Like how do reminders stress him out? And even if they did, wouldn\u2019t that be a great incentive for him to do the chores, so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with stressful reminders? \n\nAlso if he doesn\u2019t like the chore chart and find it humiliating, tell him you\u2019ll get rid of it as soon as he proves he can do his fair share. I mean does he just expect you to deal with it and do all the chores yourself while you wait forever for him to get his shit together?", "My husband cannot remember anything. I have white boards on the fridge.\nOne for each member of the house that I write daily reminder and chores on. Nta", "NTA, he\u2019s using his adhd diagnosis as an excuse for weaponized incompetence.", "ESH. He absolutely needs to take more responsibility for his ADHD (sounds like he's not really treating it at all?) and his jobs around the house. If I were you and he hasn't been responsive to your million solutions and compromises I'd kick him out. At this point it definitely counts as weaponized incompetence.\n\n\n\n However, as somebody with ADHD, getting the most childish chore chart you could find on purpose as an insult is literally bullying someone for their disability so yikes and also shaming is the least effective way to motivate anybody with ADHD. He has every right to be upset at you insinuating he's a dumb child. If you need to resort to stuff like this to make yourself feel better just do you both a favor and break up!", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s time to put the responsibility where it belongs, with him. Tell him that you are both aware of the issue. That he has an issue with the solutions you\u2019ve tried, so now it\u2019s up to him to figure out a solution. Give him a time frame and step back. Do not try to fix it, let him take responsibility.

ADHD isn\u2019t an excuse to act like a child who needs mommy to do everything for themselves. What would he do if he lived alone? \n\nThe bigger issue\u2026 do you want to live like this forever?

Personally I\u2019d rather be single than living with someone I had to treat like my child.", "I know because I was there when I was in my 20's but he has to grow up and take over some time.", "It sounds like you're managing very well! \n\nMy mental health and physical health isn't the best either, but routine does help!

I won't realise how much time has passed, so I have normal things (like changing sheets and reaching out to friends) in my schedule. \n\nI know that's not the same as having ADHD, but I try my best to find ways to work around it. He.. doesn't seem to want to try anything to help him remember.", "It weaponised incompetence, he knows you will eventually crack and do his chores.", "Agreed.  I make myself my own charts complete with super fun stickers, etc. It really helps me. I'm lost without it! Did I mention the super fun stickers?!", "Have ADHD too and I literately make one every month with the days I need to do certain things done so they stand out. It really helps! \n\nOP I\u2019m going to have to say ESH though - those things work when it\u2019s a together thing, you didn\u2019t need to be petty about it. I understand the frustration and that\u2019s valid too, but relationships only work when you work together to deal with conflict. You could have made it a fun encouraging bonding experience.

I also have ADHD, but I know it\u2019s my responsibility to limit how it effects those around me. It\u2019s not my loved ones job to pick up my slack.

You are not his parent", "NTA. He clearly just wants you to do everything with no changes on his part.", "Agree. Have adhd, I set a time limit on myself - like a short deadline. Procrastinate til the deadline then do it. That\u2019s my method. Dishes soaking and struggling? Got 1 day absolute max in a shared house, 2-3 in my own (nobody\u2019s around getting pissed and the dishes are soaked/rinsed so no bugs).", "He has to face his challenges or you have to live like this.", "NTA. If he can figure out how to complete all his tasks at work, he can use that system at home too.", "Honestly this sounds more like weaponised incompetence than adhd.

I edited my post to make that more clear. But none of those worked, and he wasn't willing to try things.", "I mean, he does well at work, so I'm assuming he's doing the things he's supposed to. He is diagnosed. He has meds, but I don't know if he actually takes them. He lived with his parents before this.", "Finally a sane response!", "And his refusal to take responsibility and be a partner means he should be treated like a child, as that's how he's behaving.", "It's hard to find decent chore chart templates that aren't designed for children because grown ass people shouldn't need them.", "I don't think that should be her responsibility too, though.

They've tried countless other methods that haven't worked, this really seems like a last resort thing. It really doesn't sound like just ADHD but a lack of effort to manage his ADHD.", "I\u2019m honestly wondering how much is adhd and how much he is using adhd as an excuse for weaponised incompetence. If he is unable to do his chores bc of his adhd he needs to look into assisted living facilities, not use his girlfriend as bang maid", ">He hits a target, he gets a game, or a footrub, or whatever else stimulates his reward system.\n\nSo he should get a reward for doing basic chores?

He hasn't put in any effort to come to a solution himself, and if he hasn't done something and I point it out (like when it's his turn to do the dishes) he still doesn't do it, he'll just say 'later' and I'll end up doing it days later.", "I have written him notes, checklists, sought out apps that could help. He refuses to use any of those.", "I admit that it was pretty. \n\nIt wasn't my intent for calling him childish for his symptoms, rather to call him childish for expecting me to clean up after him or come up with all the solutions.

Which felt childish of him.", "Act like a child, get treated like a child.", "After so many conversations about this and trying many tactics to manage his ADHD for him, I think some belittling is appropriate.

If I suggested something it made me the bad person because it was unfair to them to do something they didn't want to, or I should've known it wouldn't help. This made it hard to hold boundaries and their behavior got more egregious over time while resentment grew on both sides, as they would stop doing the basic management they used to as they got more comfortable and confident consequences wouldn't come.\n\nThey became less respectful of my own disability and needs as time went on, and I think knew I'd be more forgiving because I had my own neurodivergency and understood to a degree \n\nHe's telling you clearly he doesn't want to try to manage his ADHD for you, even if it makes your life harder, and you should believe him.

I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mature enough for a relationship, definitely not for cohabitation.

Can you live like this long term? Because if you can\u2019t and he is unwilling to change, you need to be honest with him and with yourself. ADHD can be managed. If he is unwilling to even try to manage his, even as another ADHD person, that would be a dealbreaker for me. I\u2019m never a fan of ultimatums, but I actually think one is in order here - I\u2019d be saying get help, try to address it, or I\u2019m out.", "I agreed with you in the first part but there are plenty of adults who do need chore charts/lists to remember what all needs to be done.

It is ridiculous for them to tell you that you should be doing this or that instead to better help him deal with this disability, when in fact, it is 100% NOT your responsibility at all.

I would even go so far as to think that he might be faking it. Read up on \"weaponized incompetence\".\n\nThe \"childish\" chart sounds completely appropriate for him seeing as he acts like a complete child. He's already \"humiliated\" himself on his own in front of you numerous times by showing no effort to regulate his symptoms and being a complete slob (Seriously, leaving dishes in the sink for days because he \"forgot\"?
