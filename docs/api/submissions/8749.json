She has a habit of making bad financial decisions and needing family (mainly me) to help her out. She's not absolutely terrible with money or anything, but she doesn't budget anything and just trusts that she'll find a way to make it work despite having run out of money for the rest of the month after a snap financial decision. \n\nA little less than two years ago she announced to the family and me that she planned on becoming a single mom within the next few years. Everyone in the family was congratulating her left and right. But as the one person who was raised by a single mom, I felt like she wasn't putting enough thought into her decision and I warned her that having a kid is a huge financial and emotional decision that she can't take back. She accused me of not thinking she would be a good mother and I told her that I thought she would be a great mother (she really would be/is) but that kids are expensive and that she should really take a good long look at her budget before jumping into having a kid. She still seemed a bit annoyed with me but agreed that kids were expensive and that she had thought it through. I didn't really believe her, but it's her life so I let it go. \n\nAbout six months later she announced that she was pregnant and like a lot of parents spent a ton of money getting everything she would need for a newborn. Noticing that almost everything she bought was for a 0-3 month old I went to a thrift store and got her a bunch of baby clothes for a whole range of ages. When I gave her the clothing and told her I was able to get so much (a couple boxes full) because I got them from a thrift store she called me disgusting and that her baby wouldn't be wearing gross thrift store clothing. I was honestly pretty hurt but I blamed it on \"hormones\" or something and tried to let it go. \n\nLow and behold about four months after her baby was born she basically ran out of money and came to me asking for help to pay rent. I told her she would have to find a time for me to teach her how to budget in return and I gave her the money. She never found time to learn how to budget. The next month she came to me again saying she had once again run out of cash and that she didn't have any money to buy her son new clothes which he really needed. Angry that she didn't listen to me about the expenses of a kid and that she turned down the free clothing I tried to give to her I told her she was on her own until she could prove that she can manage money and she would have to start begging someone else in the family for cash. She started screaming that I was leaving her child to die and soon after she left I started getting angry calls from relatives about not helping a new mother. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1675130914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pl7dj/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_i_wont_pay_for_her_baby/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
