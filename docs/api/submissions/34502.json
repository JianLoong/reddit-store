He would have known this had he spoken to me like a human and allowed me to explain the situation calmly and quietly. In stead, it took me, both Cops, and all of the EMTs to hold her down to tie her to a stretcher. Literally, it was embarrassing, traumatizing, and just a waste. \n\nWomen Cops are even worse because they feel the need to act super tough to show they're not weak in front of their male partners. For example, I had a 98 year old neighbor with dementia who called the cops of me on the left, the neighbor to her right, her upstairs neighbor, and her down stairs neighbor. I once spent 4 days at my mums to help her after a surgery she had and when I got home the cops were at my door. One time I was watching a movie and she called the cops. They got there asked me what I had been doing like noise wise I explained the situation and said I'm watching a movie, with my turtle beach headphones. They couldn't hear it and my front door was in the same room. Three hours later, at 2 AM I hear banging on my door. I open it and there are two Cops. One male one female. I asked if I could help them, wiping sleep from eyes cause they woke me up. Rosa again. I explain the situation including the earlier situation, guys says \"okay we understand.\" The woman is super aggressive and says \"Well if we're called a third time you're getting arrested.\" I'm like what? I'm getting arrested because my neighbor with dementia calls the cops on everyone? She told me to lower my tone when I spoke with her. For Context on Rosa this woman lived there for three years by the time I moved in. Between the 4 apartments around her she had 17 people move out. I was the 18th. \n\nCops have never made me feel safer in any situation.  This isn't even counting their crimes and unethical behavior across the country. In the words of Destructo Disk: \"All dogs go to heaven and all cops go to hell, because man's best friend won't put a bullet in your head, and a cop fucking will.\"", "\u201cIs the police THAT bad over there?\u201d\n\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site", "\u201cActually, their job is a public service and saying \" hello, how ya doing? \"  is interacting with the public and being visible for say...someone that might need them?\u201d\n\nLies: Courts have repeatedly ruled that their ONLY duty is to serve the party's [a government agency] public safety interests that \u201cemploy\u201d them.
