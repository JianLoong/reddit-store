The house itself might not look all that impressive at first glance, it's not some kind of royal mansion, but I love it all the same. It's also on a beautiful piece of land that my old friends and I know every inch of. The inside is kind of an amalgamation of every phase and interest my parents ever had. It's chaotic in the best way. I adore it.\n\nI don't get to visit all that often anymore, usually only twice a year: once for Christmas and once for my family's summer get together that they host. This year, they insisted the move up that summer get together since I've been dating someone new for a few months now. They said they didn't want to wait until summer to meet her, so we scheduled it for last weekend. The weather cooperated with us to partially host outside and, in typical fashion of my parents, they managed to wrangle all my teenage friends into coming to visit as well. These are people who I still talk to often, but there's just a different vibe when we're back at the estate. \n\nMy girlfriend has always seemed like a kind person, but the weekend did not go as planned. Because all of my friends were there, particularly Rome (26m), I spent a significant amount of time hanging out with them. Rome was my closest friend back then (and in some ways I'd say he still is). He practically lived at my home back then - his parents had a similar estate to ours, but his house was the kind that felt TOO pristine to touch anything. \n\nThat kind of pristine feel was, apparently, what my girlfriend was expecting. At some point, she made a comment saying she 'wasn't expecting my house to look like *this*.\" Rome asked her what she meant by that and she went on to say that when I told her my parents were wealthy, she was anticipating the house to look different. This was arguably my parents battle to fight, but Rome has never been very good at keeping quiet when things like this happened, so he proceeded to say some pretty scathing things in return.\n\nMy girlfriend went to bed early that night and didn't come out as I was saying my goodbyes to my friends. We've talked since then and she said it was awful that I hadn't defended her and that she had just said what she did because I was spending so much of my time with Rome and my other friends. I told her her motivations were ridiculous and what she said was beyond inappropriate. It\u2019s not my responsibility to come to her defense when she\u2019s wrong. She asked me how many times I did that for Rome.

And so is your friend, he was just waiting to jump on to something to be mad about. What\u2019s worse is that you know that.

Wake up dude.\n\nThere\u2019s no way that she would just randomly say something insulting about your parents to your best friend THAT SHE JUST MET.

Either way there is information missing and it feels like you left it out to protect Rome.

You've been dating for a few months and you left her alone with your troubled jealous best friend and then didn't care that Rome was more territorial than an untrained chihuahua.", "Why wasn't she hanging out with your friends with you, too? That seems like a huge overreaction if that is all she said. It sounds like your parents house WOULD be rather surprising so why act like that's a huge offense being surprised? Why didn't you stop your friend from verbally assaulting her if you had no clue why he was doing so? Like wouldn't you be like whoa why the hell are you cursing at my girlfriend?

You handled everything poorly.", "Need more information, but I think YTA.   You brought your girlfriend to meet your parents yet spent most of the time with your buddies.  Did you include her?  You've bragged about your parents wealth, growing up on the most beautiful, magical \"estate.\"  From your description, I would have assumed you lived in a castle-like estate.  Her comment that it was not what she envisioned wasn't really so awful, and was not an invitation for Rome to verbally attack her with \"scathing\" things.  WTF?  He's a bully & major AH too. Yes, she's a big girl and needs to own her words; yet, you were complicit by not telling him to stop.  Yeah, you and your buddy are both AH", "YTA. Maybe she is too but we won\u2019t know because you weren\u2019t there. There were so many red flags in your post I don\u2019t know where to start?!? Ditching her for friends when she was there to meet your family. Not defending her, even though you say she is a nice person with no history of saying mean things. Immediately taking a friends side without checking what was actually said. Saying it\u2019s not your job as a partner to support her if she is wrong, which you don\u2019t even know?!? All bad. Her worst possible offence in all this is saying that your family home is not what she expected, and unless she said it in a very particular way is not rude. I have said people/things/places are not what I expected many times and have also received that comment many times in life, it\u2019s not inherently rude or snobbish.", "YTA unless I am missing something.  She said your house wasn't what she expected after you talked it up and that she expected a more traditional wealthy home.  I don't see anything derogatory in that.  Maybe I am missing the tone?  \n\nShe was on your turf and with your friends and family and you need to be the one to shut down anyone attacking her.  You also have a greater need to look out for her there and not leave her alone while you hang with the buds.", "YTA You build up your childhood home to your girlfriend. You invite your girlfriend to spend a weekend with your parents. They host a party for you and you ignore her to catch up with your friends.", "YTA. What you\u2019re reporting she said isn\u2019t offensive. You and Rome are thinned skin and childish. \n\nAnd yes, you should defend your girlfriend when she\u2019s being attacked verbally or physically. Sounds like Rome is more important to you and that Rome was looking for a reason to go off on her.", "YTA. From reading your comments you think that your toxic best friend is funny for what he did. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this turns out to be a game for the two of you.", "YTA. As you describe it, this trip was, primarily, about introducing your girlfriend to your parents, and you spent most of the time with your friends. What Rome said to her (going from your description as \"scathing\") was not proportionate to what she said. What could have been just an awkward faux pas turned into a situation simply because Rome escalated it. \n\nCan't wait for future posts about how he runs off other girlfriends, as you keep shrugging it off!", "YTA, I hope she dumps your pathetic ass.", "Maybe ESH but definitely YTA.\n\nShe\u2019s probably already nervous meeting your family for the first time, much less a whole gaggle of your childhood friends. It\u2019s your responsibility to make sure your gf feels welcomed and included among the rest of you. It doesn\u2019t sound like you put that much effort into that. On top of this, you dismissing her feelings about it is such an asshole move.\n\nOn the other hand, implying your home isn\u2019t as pristine or fancy as expected (_if_ this is indeed what she meant), is rude and disrespectful.", "Your girlfriend said something not really socially acceptable but let me get this straight\u2014you took her to meet your family, friends, and hometown for the first time and then ditched her to mostly hang out with them. She probably had a WHOLE other idea how this weekend would go. Yta.", "YTA. So your girlfriend was:\n\n1. A guest YOU brought to your childhood home to meet YOUR family for the first time.\n\n2. Ignored and neglected by you because you valued everyone else above her.\n\n3. Lashed out at by Rome because of a supposed comment he took offensively as he\u2019s \u201cterritorial\u201d (a situation you weren\u2019t even present for). \n\n4. Dismissed in favor of your friend, who you enabled and defended over her. You even admit in a comment he has serious anger issues, which you\u2019re oddly invested in excusing. \n\n5. Invalidated, because she communicated her feelings and needs to you, which you rebuffed.\n\nYou and Rome were the ones in the wrong. You also sound far too self-centered and immature to be in a serious relationship, especially given your questionable attachment to Rome.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t seem like she said anything malicious. And unless she said it in a tone of absolute disgust, you\u2019re friend was way out of line.", "YTA\n\n>It\u2019s not my responsibility to come to her defense when she\u2019s wrong.\n\nBut yet here you are coming to your friend's defense when he is wrong. He was an AH to a stranger for an issue HE made. You even commented that he is rude for no reason sometimes. You didn't even care about your gf enough to ask her what happened. Control your attack dog, it's not cute.\n\nEDIT: The \"lame\" pact to get together and Rome's behavior toward  ~~his competition~~ your gf is quite a combo.", "YTA.  If your home is chaotic and might \u201cnot look impressive at first glance\u201d, then stop calling it an estate to people who don\u2019t know what it looks like.  Because you\u2019re going to get the same reaction your gf gave.\n\nPlus, she was a guest at your home and you basically abandoned her to hang out with your friends.   Hope she dumps you for not having her back.", "I think YTA for allowing your friend to insult your girlfriend for a very mild statement about your house. Especially if you have only been together a few months and she does not have a rapport with your friends and family, she was probably nervous and felt out of place as it was. You should have had her back, even if you felt that her comment was out of line. This has set the tone for her to be perceived as the whiny, unpleasant girlfriend, which is probably not the way you want her to be perceived. \n\nThat being said, the fact that she made this comment because you were hanging out with your friend is also a bit childish and shows that, while the comment was not particularly harsh, she did say it with some level of vindictiveness. Ideally, she could have given you some space to hang out with your friends, knowing that you don't see them often and knowing that she might feel a bit the outsider at times. And if it began to feel like she was being completely left out and she was not comfortable, she could have expressed that to you, rather than retaliating with how unimpressive your house was. Maybe ask her to be more upfront with her feelings so they can be addressed appropriately next time. And then be there for her if her feelings are that she is feeling out of place.", "YTA and I\u2019m willing to bet your family is too. You can tell a lot about someone from the company they keep and Rome sounds like terrible company. \n\nYou also give very limited information in your post and comments, that\u2019s probably in Rome\u2019s favor since he seems to be the only one you care to defend. Overall I hope you take the comments to heart.", "YTA, I read through the excuses. Not once did it sound like she was being disrespectful.  Your bestie was out of pocket, and you think well thats just how he is. Your friend sucks, and so do you. You guys are literally acting like the pretentious AH everyone sees in the movies based on rich people. It really doesn't matter as I expect this girl to be your ex soon.

I would personally ask your parents opinion on how it was said - because it doesn't sound as if Rome is a reliable narator. That said, it is rude to just abandon someone the way you did your girlfriend when meeting so many new people, and giving her some leeway makes sense because you probably left her feeling very uncomfortable and out of her depth which can make it even more likely she put her foot in her mouth but didn't mean anything poorly.

She likely felt very awkward and anxious around new people. Regardless, I don't know how she said it. Neither do you. What I do know is that your job is to make sure your partner is included in all conversations, especially when they are around new people. I'm talking for several visits, until they are comfortable.

I grew up middle to upper middle class but my family came from Ethiopia so what we did have, I had a lot of pride in because of how hard my family worked. A recent gf/bf/partner disregarding the nuances of what a childhood home means to you is really hurtful. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m gonna come out of left field and say YTA for not being a better bridge between your gf and your friends (totally excluding the house comment).
