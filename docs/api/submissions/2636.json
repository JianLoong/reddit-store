I won\u2019t go into detail, but I was not happy. This got so bad that at the age of 16 I moved out of home. she had disowned me for not wanting to be involved in the Mormon religion. I have never held a grudge against her, as I know that she is a stubborn person. She did not contact me for 3 years, leaving all of my messages on delivered. \n\nAfter three years, my sister informed me that she was engaged and that she would love me to attend her wedding, expressing how happy she would be if I attended. I ended up deciding to attend, as I come from a family in which life revolved around family, and I wanted to support my sister, despite previous family issues. \n\nThere was no major drama at the wedding, however attending this event affected my mental health to a large extent. This is not necessarily anyones fault\u2026it was just that seeing family members after such a long time restored a lot of negative emotions from the past that I had spent a lot of time blocking out. Safe to say\u2026I was a wreck for the following month or two. \n\nFast forward to a year later. My mum had earlier this year informed me that she was engaged. It had been surprising for me at the time that she had even thought to inform me since she had very rarely contacted me since I had moved out of home at 16 years old. \n\nTime passed and information about the wedding had been all over the place, from not receiving an official invitation and being expected to know that I was invited and what date to be saving, to the wedding being called off and put back on. I had also received information that I the wedding was being held on the exact weekend on which I had been planning to move house, ready to start my new job. The thought of the move had already been stressing me out a lot since I was moving 4 hours away from my current location and the wedding is being held a 17 hour drive from my current location, meaning that I will need to purchase flights to attend the wedding which will cost a minimum of $400. I am just finishing university, and will already be struggling financially with the move as is. Plus knowing that I will be likely super depressed for a month following the wedding wedding, right when I am about to start my new job is not ideal. \n\nOn the other hand, my mum is super family orientated , and will be likely heartbroken if I do not attend, plus will be infuriated since in the past they have not understood the significant effect that a weekend away from work can have on me. \n\nSo if i do not attend\u2026AITA?", "created_utc": 1668778586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyk9hz/aita_if_i_dont_go_to_my_mums_wedding/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
