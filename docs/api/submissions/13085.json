My brother attended but his wife didn't. She was nearing her due date to give birth and she didn't come. The wedding was going well. Til my brother recieved a call from his mil telling him that sil was in labor. He told me he was leaving and my wife and I were fine with that but the issue began after he had told one of the guests that sil was in labor. Word spread out and suddenly, everybody was talking about it which disrupted the event. Even my parents started calling and there was a huge fuss which frankly, was unnecessary if my brother just left in silence or made up some excuse.\n\nI contacted him later and expressed my grief and frustration with what he did. I told him how the news of his wife being in labor disrupted the wedding and caused my wife to feel like her day was ruined. He lashed out asking how any of that was his fault. I explained how he should've just left or made up some excuse to leave but he said he didn't mean any harm and that he was in a hurry and worried at the time. He said it wasn't like he announced it and told me I disrespected him by arguing with him about it. We had a big argument and our parents sided with him and told me to 'get over myself' and are now expecting me to apologize.\n\n\nEdit// I just came back and started reading the comments. First comment I appreciate the sarcasm but in all seriousness, I did not expect people to come against me in this matter.

Did you congratulate him on the birth btw?\n\nYes, you and your wife are allowed to be disappointed that everyone was talking about the baby instead of you, however it was not planned or intentional.  Your brother did his best to leave quietly and not cause a disruption.  Of COURSE your parents called them, their DIL just had a baby and they're now grandparents - it's not like they ran out in the middle of the wedding ceremony to go sit in the hospital.\n\nAfter writing all that out, I'm going to go with YTA for the way you handled it.", "YTA a 100%. You expect him to make up a story about why he is leaving during what will be one of the most significant parts of his life. He didn't make an announcement and just quietly told someone why he was leaving. It's not his problem your wife is a diva who needs the whole world paying attention to her. She could have still had a great wedding event despite this but she and you decided to make yourselves put upon. Grow up and hope that when you have kids, your brother actually gives a crap since you obviously care more about yourself than him.", "YTA and you do need to get over yourself.  You parents were inevitably going to know and tell people, someone else just beat them to the punch.  You cannot possibly expect people at a wedding to be talking about you and only you for an entire day\u2019s worth of events. \n\nEveryone who gets married needs to know one thing and one thing only:  no matter how you get married (big traditional wedding or simple courthouse and everything in between) IT IS NOT THE WEDDING THAT MATTERS.  \n\nIt\u2019s the marriage that matters and that needs to be the only thing that matters.  I also highly doubt that people talking about it overshadowed the entire wedding event, I doubt it went on for very long, and I believe you\u2019re overdramatizing the events.  \n\nGreat things cns happen to two people at the same time without them needed to compete with each other.", "YTA he told one person, he had no intention of making your wedding about him. I know it blew up more than expected but it wasn't intentional and it's not like he could do anything about it since he was trying to get to his wife in time for the birth. I understand why it upset you but you seriously need to get over yourself. If I was in your shoes I'd apologize", "Why does all these AITA stories have something to do with weddings now? Are everyone getting married at the same time?\n\nAnd also YTA. It was your wedding day but it was also the day your brother's kid was born, why can't you be happy at both things? It's not like he announced it to everyone. Word gets around quickly and people where excited about the news. It doesn't mean they stopped caring about your wedding. You should've just celebrated twice as hard!", "YTA. Get over yourself and then go back around and get over yourself again. \n\u2018Made up some excuse?\u2019 My dude, you can NOT be using your thinking brain. It\u2019s his CHILD. Your niece or nephew! His wife stayed home so as not to cause a rumpus and he LEFT her to come share your day. \n\nI hope he doesn\u2019t accept your apology, because I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be sincere, and I hope they both go NC with you and your horrible bride. I\u2019d have been at the hospital in my dang wedding dress, not wailing about the fact that someone\u2019s water had the temerity to break on the day I said \u2018I do\u2019. \n\nYBTA. Both of y\u2019all. \n\nJesus, both of y\u2019all are a lot. Good night nurse, what a blatherskite.", "YTA. Would you have preferred if he just left without saying anything? How was he supposed to know he wasn't \"allowed\" to tell anyone else?\n\nWhy do you expect that everyone can only talk about you? Weddings are long. No one can only manage to talk about the wedding itself during the wedding. Get over yourself.", "YTA. It\u2019s your brother. People would have noticed he left anyway. Why can\u2019t you just be happy for them? How was your wife\u2019s \u201cday ruined\u201d?", "YTA. He did the best he could. \n\nINFO: if your wife was in labor, would you want to stick around and think of an excuse? probably not.", "YTA - when you get a call that your child is on the way rational thought is out the window. I'm sure the last thing he cared about was your wedding at that moment in time but still had enough respect to come and let you know and you can't blame him for other people blabbing.", "YTA. If he had left without saying anything, I guarantee you would have been pissed at that, too. He was kind enough to attend your wedding when his wife was due; his options were 1) leave, letting folks know why 2) leave, with no explanation, or 3) not attend. IMO he chose the most generous route.", "YTA. Totally. I get that people think their wedding day should be \u201call about them\u201d but that is honestly unhealthy and frankly doesn\u2019t bode well for the marriage. Your brother is right, your parents are right, you need to \u201cget over yourself\u201d and learn how to spell \u201cdisrupted.\u201d", "YTA. I agree with so many of the commenters in that I don\u2019t understand why this was an issue. It was my SIL\u2019s birthday the day after my wedding and we dedicated a song and wished her happy birthday during our reception. It did not detract from my happiness.", "Yeah, dude. You are most definitely the AH here. \n\nApologize to your brother, congratulate him on the birth of his child, and send a lovely gift to the new parents from you and your wife. \n\nI will never understand people who think their wedding day is all about controlling other people\u2019s thoughts and actions.", "YTA. You knew the due date was coinciding with your wedding...did none of you think of this possibility? Did you want your brother to just slink off silently without anyone having any idea what was going on during a potentially life-threatening medical event?", "Grief?? What in the overdramatic bride/groomzilla?\n\nYTA and you do need to get over yourself lol.", "Sometimes it can be hard to overcome the grief that you\u2019re not the main character in life.\n\nYTA", "YTA - \n\nYou could have made the party even better by announcing it to all the guests.

What can\u2019t ppl you know\u2026 just be happy for others??? Plus, it\u2019s YOUR BROTHER.

Frustration can exist without you needing to place blame on someone for something completely out of there control. Deal with the world happening around you, it will never stop", "YTA.", "YTA for sure. Why would he have made up an excuse? That doesn't make sense. He's in a hurry to leave, people ask why, he tells them. It wasn't some planned personal attack. Weird asf that this upset you so much. It would be one thing if they announced their pregnancy or he proposed to his partner. But he didn't. His wife went into labor, he left, your family (who is also his family btw) were excited. That's it. Two exciting things can exist at the same time. Nothing was ruined.", "Literally no one gives a fuck about your wedding except you and your wife, guests are filler who will forget about it a few days/weeks after it\u2019s done. Situations that arise in other peoples lives are important to them and you are not going to be the centre point of their thought processes. Stop being a self centred a-hole and be happy for your brother. You had your moment and then it was his turn, it just so happened to be on the same day. \n\nSuch a main character moment, YTA.", "YTA. Everyone is already there, all dressed up, doing a whole day for you two.

You only said it to your brother to try to make him feel worse.", "YTA dude.  You got married.  I'm sure he's happy for you.  He's having a kid, but nooooooo, you own that day and can't let him tell one person?? Did you listen to yourself at all when you typed this?

Not his fault it went on from there.", "YTA, big time. The only people who thought the wedding was ruined was apparently just you and your wife. It takes SUCH an ego to be upset about your niece/nephew about to be born, because it just so happens to overlap with your reception. Thank goodness I'm not the brother or SIL in the situation, I wouldn't allow any contact with my new child until amends were made by both you and your wife.

I think lying just to keep the focus on you is not the right call.\n\nI am not sure how long you took for planning the wedding, but couldn\u2019t you have planned it a bit earlier/later? Your SIL would have known for 6-8 months that she is pregnant, especially if it was planned.

I'm guessing it didn't rise to that level, but they have to say it to demonstrate the horrendous depth of their searing pain -- because someone talked about someone ELSE on that day.", "The edit is easily the best part. Totally incapable of any self reflection.", "Right?  It's still your day.  It's not like all of the guests are going to be leaving and saying, \"Wow, too bad we can no longer acknowledge the wedding we just went to since it's now the baby's birthday.\"", "Baby raises his sippy cup and says \"my aunt and uncle are leaving to celebrate their first wedding anniversary, what a great day we will forever share with my aunt and uncle, cheers and good luck\"", "Umbilically*", "Yeah, all my moms ,OG, Step and MIL, along with my bridemaids just kinda froze.  I laughed and said maybe offering red wine wasn't a good idea.  We wiped off what we could and just moved on.  No reason to cry over spilled wine or spilled milk (unless you just sent a half hour trying to pump that breastmilk.  You can definitely cry about that.)", "This thread is life \ud83d\ude4c", "Hey!!! Long time no see! How you been leftie??", "With my in-laws it would have been very distracting, but that would be on them.  They would have spent the entire night making public updates on the dialation size of the cervix.

OP made more of a big deal out of it than it had to be.", "To be fair, sounds like OP's wife might be married to someone completely toxic too", "Yeah doing a toast would be a great way to go about it! It would also give it it's own \"space\" to be discussed and then everyone would get back to the party after 5 mins and it wouldn't be gossipy anymore", "This, absolutely.\n\nWeddings are about family, as well as about the couple getting married.  It is the joining of two families, bringing new relatives together.\n\nAnd this is another new relative!  Some sort of commemoration is appropriate, and doesn't distract from the wedding, but rather adds to the celebratory nature of the day.\n\nDepending on when and where you were when you found out about the labor, there are a variety of ways that this could be recognized.\n\nIf you're having a religious ceremony, adding a prayer for the safe deliverance of mother and child, or of thanksgiving for a successful birth, would be one option.  Or offering a toast at the reception.  Or during the dancing, having the DJ announce the birth and the name of the baby, and all the guests join in a cheerful and probably drunken rendering of the song \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nDone properly, recognizing the labor and the birth would not distract at all.  If anything, it would make this wedding far more memorable, so that guests remember the event long after the memories of other weddings have blurred over time. \n\nWhen my brother got married, we discovered, at the last minute, that a cousin of ours in Germany was getting married the same day.  A toast was offered in honor of the other happy couple, and it certainly took no joy away from my brother's wedding.", "Must have been the one that only served water.", "I bet it's that dry wedding from the other day that only served water", "Only water was served at the wedding."]}
