However,inform your friend before bringing your food", "NTA- But for having you as a bridesmaid AND the DJ the bride should have at least asked the catering company if they have options for those with dietary restrictions.

Obviously you are entitled to eat according to your health issues.

Because then I would eat a huge meal (a safe one for you) beforehand. \n\nOr is this a very quick ceremony followed by a buffet of the pizza, wings and donuts? Because then I would bring a bunch of snacks and hork them down in between songs. (Crazy that you're a bridesmaid AND the DJ AND you can't even eat.)", "NTA! You can't eat the wedding food, period. Bring your own with a light heart and a clear conscience.", "NTA This is a medical issue. End of discussion.", "  As someone who has had ongoing digestive issues\\~hell YES you can bring your own food.\n\n   I have done this at everything from company picnics to post-funeral lunches. I use a thermal  lunch bag that look like a purse/tote. I usually pack things that don't need heating, but are kept cold w/ice packs. I often pack a water bottle + snacks, in addition to my meal.  \n\nTell the bride & groom *now;* this means that they (& prob their families/attendants) know why you're not eating the regular food.", "NTA.. just talk to her and explain the situation", "Yeah. I basically eat rice and chicken right now. It sucks! I don't expect to be exclusively catered to but I just wanted to not be seen as rude for eating!", "That's fair. I just know other people who can't eat things on the menu so I was concerned that people would have to leave to get food.", "Agreed, and use the same plate/table setting provided for the guests. No one will think twice if it looks like the caterer brought you a special dietary meal, but you could be the AH if you're eating out of a Tupperware.", "Yeah, this is my question too. I mean dietary restrictions should be taken into consideration because it\u2019s guests health. But I can see it causing friction potentially if OP pulls out her meal and the bride and groom didn\u2019t know she was bringing it", "She was debating a couple of options and the other ones were things I could eat!", "By persuade I mean she was debating three food places and the other two were things I could eat so I so said I would prefer x. She choose pizza anyway!", "Between set up, the wedding, and take down I'll probably be there for 10 ish hours.", "Look at it this way - as a bridesmaid and DJ you have responsibilities during the wedding.  It's actually LESS rude to make sure you can perform them by bringing your own food!!  (I.e. you won't be passing out from lack of food or being sick from eating what's provided!!!)\n\nETA: Since you're a friend you may not have given her a contract, but I know a lot of vendors (DJ, photographer, etc.) have in them that they must have a meal provided.  Heck, my photographers had a clause \"must have a meal provided or we will leave to get food which will take a minimum of one hour (taking away from your time))\".  You could make sure (in the future if it's too late for now) that your contract specifies \"must have food I can eat (list dietary restrictions) or I will provide my own meal, for an additional charge of $50 for cost of food and inconvenience\"", "I\u2019d definitely bring up the idea of letting others bring their own food then. I confess I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat what you\u2019ve listed other than a donut.", "Happy cake day OP!", "So just ask her?", "Damn, that's a long time. And a lot of jobs for you! \n\nIn that case, I'd go with a bunch of snacks you can have here and there off to the side. But she really should be fine with you eating next door for all the work you're doing for her. I just don't know how you'd do it if you're DJing. \n\nWhatever you do, don't eat her food and get sick, and definitely don't fast the whole day while you're standing and working and standing some more.", "Well now that I know it's not an asshole move I will!", "Yep you are definitely fine to let her know due to medical reasons you'd like to bring your own food. You can let her know that you will clear it with the venue so she knows she won't have to do any extra work. Just make sure it's cleared."]}
