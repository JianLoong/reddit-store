He is fairly social while I am more introverted. \n\nMy health has slowly declined in recent years. Recently I was diagnosed with the cause: a severe chronic illness, and I started treatment for it. As my body adjusts to this medication I am experiencing debilitating side effects. I feel very weak and sore, and vomit throughout the day. This has been going on for a few weeks. There is possibly a few more weeks of this to come until the side effects start to subside. \n\nI have no family here so my expectation was for my partner would help me through this, and he does help, to an extent. Often, however, I would feel that I am holding him back and being a bother. He has all these social activities scheduled ahead of time that I don\u2019t necessarily know of (he may not have told me, or I could have forgotten), and when I ask whether he could look after me, about 80% of the time I get told that he is busy. \n\nI know his social life is important to him, and I really hate the idea of asking him to cancel or scale back the things he loves. But I also need him and I never seem to pick the right time - there is always something booked in.  This is actually a frequent point of tension in our relationship. He wants me to join him more often, while I\u2019ve been so physically drained that I haven\u2019t had capacity to have fun in years. I feel I am barely surviving as is, and that we are in very different stages in life. \n\nMy current side effects are essentially identical to early pregnancy, so this also makes me fearful for when we decide to have children. I fear that he will not be willing to give up his social lifestyle and help me through the pregnancy. \n\nTo make things worse, he hasn\u2019t been very compassionate over my illness. We work in the same industry and have similar career aspirations. He has never hesitated to point out how I am falling behind, that \u201cit looks bad\u201d when I am absent from work and it doesn\u2019t matter how it came about or how unfair it is.  \u201cIt\u2019s just not good.\u201d He says. While I factually agree with him, and like to think he is encouraging me to do better,  deep down I feel he simply doesn\u2019t believe in my illness, or me. Either way his comments seem cruel and belittling. \n\nFor comparison, just two months ago I was on a work trip, and he was looking after my cat for me. One evening he called to complain that it was all too much. Immediately I changed my return flight to the next morning and cancelled the rest of the trip. It was the right thing for me to do and I have absolutely no regrets. The recent events made me feel he would not do the same for me. Are we just in different life stages, or is this something more fundamental?", "created_utc": 1700822813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182ph6m/aita_for_wanting_my_partner_to_reduce_his_social/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Oh dear. You have no future with that man. Sorry, but he puts everything else before you. NTA.", "NTA - your partner doesn\u2019t sound like a good life partner. He seems to mostly think about himself and how you make him look. Based on what you said he seems more concerned about how your illness is affecting your career, and how he looks in connection to that, than how it is affecting you as a person. He is prioritizing himself, his personal enjoyment, his hobbies, his friends, and you are being treated as an afterthought. I think you are right to be concerned about how he will act if you get pregnant and have children. You cancelled your work trip because he couldn\u2019t handle taking care of your cat. A cat! And then he has the audacity to complain about your career trajectory?!? Taking care of kids is much more labour intensive than taking care of a cat. It is pretty likely that you will be expected to shoulder the brunt of the parenting, probably while he is complaining that you aren\u2019t advancing your career fast enough. If it were me, I would take a hard look at what kind of life you actually want to have, and if he is really who you want to spend it with. He is showing you who he is, believe him.", "You need to have a frank conversation about this with your partner.  It sounds like you're asking for things when you need them, but have you actually said \"you're not giving me the support I need, and these things are the problem\"?

I realise you lack alternative support right now when you need it, but this guy is *adding* to your sadness.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThe last incident you mentioned kind of solidifies the fact that he may not reciprocate your actions on his own accord.", "NTA. Hard to be certain if your boyfriend is the asshole (except the cat thing), but you aren't. However, you are right this is something you should be looking at seriously and probably figure out a way to have the conversation about the support you need from him.", "NTA and I fail to see how canceling a work trip because he couldn\u2019t handle feeding a cat was \u201cthe right thing\u201d for you to do.

His enjoyment and success seems to matter more than anything else, including you.\n\nYou got to see the real him when you're in duress. Do you still want him?\n\nNTA", "NTA. If he finds a cat difficult, he sure as hell won\u2019t be able to manage a future child. Given everything you\u2019ve said, I believe your gut instinct is correct here on all aspects. You\u2019re not asking him to stop everything, but asking for some support because you\u2019re chronically ill. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.

What is it then that you would want? A man cancelling all his plans to sit accross from you waiting until you need a cup of tea, extra blanket, bucket? Surely what you really want is the man to offer to stay home and do all this so that you can decline the offer and go to bed with your iPad and relax? Is it more of a performative thing? Just wondering from my own pov and 5 months pregnant \ud83d\ude04. Other than that, the thing with the cat is utterly ridiculous and he doesn\u2019t seem like a very kind man.

He writes down all this months things he has plans. That way you know at a glance if he's busy or not.", "You being scared of voicing your needs and requests is actually not a good sign. Sounds like you know he will decline and actually openly state that he doesn't want to care for you. Take this as a fact, not something to discuss. My advice would be to leave him.\n\nI had an ex similar to your bf. He had friends over for playing video games while I was in bed with my period. My ex offered to get me a hot water bottle after their round but kept pushing it back after every round when I asked him to follow through with his offer. In the end his sexist best friend got up and made me a hot water bottle because he couldn't take my ex ignoring me anymore. We didn't last long after this. It wasn't the only thing that bothered me but in this moment i realised the pattern. It won't get better with these type of people.", "Looking after your cat was too much??? Cats don't need looking after!! Make sure they've got food and water and cuddle them when they want. How hard is that? Sorry but it seems to me that he doesn't really value you at all. He doesn't seem to care what you are going through and is very unwilling to be there for you. You deserve better and I hope you get it.", "NTA but he is! Dump his ass, you're gonna need all the energy you can when it comes to your condition and your job.\n\nSpeaking of, with how he's talking to /you/ about it not being a good look, I wouldn't be surprised if he's badmouthing you at work either. Or that he's letting people believe you're \"not /that/ sick\", seeing as he's willing to go off all the time and have fun by himself. Because a loving partner /would/ scale back and be supportive. A loving partner would try to build you up instead of talking to you the way he is doing. He can't even manage a cat for a little while? He would /not/ be there for you during pregnancy either.\n\nThis isn't different stages of life. This is different stages of evolution, with him being /way/ behind.\n\nYou say you have no family there, well, who's closest? Or is there any friend nearby who would be willing to support you? Because at this point I'm pretty sure your cat is doing leaps and bounds more for you than your \"partner\" but you definitely need more than that.", "NTA\n\nBased on what you've said, I'm inclined to believe he does suspect you are deceiving him about your physical health and subsequent needs. With your new diagnosis, you have an opportunity to really impress him when it comes to how capable you are of managing yourself and your life and work. You can show him your strength and determination, and your independence. On the other hand, you have also the opportunity to try to manipulate him into being your primary caregiver (unpaid of course) out of guilt, if not compassion and love. He is aware that you have these options. If you choose to go the demand more route, be prepared for him to show you the door.", "He's checking out of the relationship. You guys are not married, he's in his prime,he's very social and focused on his career as he should be at that age.He's not trying to be a FT care taker as hurtful as that sounds....He's only 30.He wants to be able to enjoy life, have fun , do things before...life happens. Unfortunately, I feel like you guys are mismatched. You're introverted and sick all the time (not your fault).Chronic illnesses don't get better, they get worse. He's not mentally or emotionally ready to take that on. He expressed that\" it was all too much\" while taking care of your cat. Do you really think he's in the frame of mind to have children? You both are young, but unfortunately on different paths. -No one is at fault here.", "NTA I\u2019m afraid the cat\u2019s out of the bag on this one. I think you\u2019re purrfectly entitled to expect your partner to step up for your medical situation. I\u2019d be having kittens if I were you. Throw him in the litter and nip this in the bud. You don\u2019t have 9 lives you want to make the most of the 1 you have.", "NTA I'm afraid it sounds fundamental. \n\nHe was happy enough when you were well but he isn't going to step up.", "NTA....he can't look after a cat for a short amount of time? How is he going to handle a kid? Even if he was sooooo busy it is something he agreed to. Then you had to cut your work trip short and he is also getting on your case about missing work? Not cool, even if it's not in the same instance. He is selfish, and it doesn't look like he wants to change even a little and expects you to change for him even if it's not healthy. You are better off alone because at least you can clear your mind of expecting him to do something and not following through , your going to be doing it yourself anyway.", "Looking after a cat is \"too much for him\"?!? Do not even think of having children with this poor excuse for a man/partner. You're fooling yourself to imagine he cares about you. He'll dump you when the inconvenience is too much for him.", "Let me make some excuses for him, just to give the benefit of the doubt. \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the cat that made it too much, but rather the travelling between our two households and keeping both tidy. That week was also very hectic for him work wise (he was pulling stupid 14 hour work days). On that phone call I could immediately tell he was not doing well, thus my immediate return. \n\nTo be completely honest, there was probably an element of selfishness there. I wasn\u2019t going to let my cat be looked after by someone mentally unwell. \n\nLove your username btw. Big chicken fan here! (guess my cats name. hint- favourite food)", "This is such an insightful comment especially with his seemingly high concern of my career trajectory - I\u2019m finally coming to understand it. Yes I have some hard thinking to do. Thank you!", "Thank you this is good advice, and I think I could be clearer. Currently I only make it clear when I am terribly unwell, and he drops everything then. Other times are a bit hazy, as in I won\u2019t die on my own but I would still much prefer to be looked after. This is where I feel the most unsure - between his activities booked days to weeks ahead, and my sudden unwellness. I am also conscious that it is a lot to ask of someone in a short period of time.", "I don\u2019t think even just company and empathy is too much to ask for when you\u2019re struggling. If you can\u2019t go out it must suck for someone who is supposed to love you to just carry on as normal while you\u2019re home alone. \n\nI\u2019ve cancelled a holiday this weekend because my dog isn\u2019t well and I want to be here for her. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do the same for my partner if he needed me.", "You make a very good point. In fact \u201cwhat do you want me to do\u201d is something he frequently asks. I think it just doesn\u2019t come across as clear for many guys \ud83d\ude02. \n\nI usually get stunted by that question and feel stupid. Now that I think about it, I want cuddles, someone to hold the bucket and pull my hair back when I vomit, walk me up and down the stairs, and just be there for me. I still feel so afraid to actually speak this request!", "Oh sorry I should\u2019ve been clearer. He does share his calendar with me, and this includes personal plans. I don\u2019t look at it as often as I should because some events run shorter or get cancelled, and others can be impromptu and not listed. But I try use it as a guide and I think it\u2019s a good idea. \n\nThe recent problem is that I am unwell so much, and he has most downtime booked out, that collisions are inevitable. On that topic - if something is planned, should I not disrupt it unless I\u2019m really dying? I feel really unsure here.", "Agh you hit a pain point and something just clicked in me! He is seen as my representative at work when I\u2019m away. I have been wondering why my colleagues treat me so coldly these days. We went to buy lunch today and half way I stopped, bent down preparing to vomit. They just walked off and kept talking and laughing\u2026 They must be convinced that I\u2019m just acting it out.", "Yeah I think you nailed it. This is his exact mentality. I\u2019m really fighting for route 1, yet reality punches me back and says you don\u2019t have superpower. It sucks that he is suspicious and not compassionate. I can see how manipulative it could become though. It is never my intent to fake illness to manipulate, but with how suddenly i become unwell (sudden nausea, faintness), it must have come across that way a few times.", "Rooting for your OP, I hope you get through this and have a happier and healthier future.", "Yeah. So throw him out with the trash if you can, and get in touch with your superior or someone trusted to make sure you maintain your image properly because he ain't doing shit to help you in any way shape or form. Especially when /he/ made /you/ bail on a /work trip/.\n\nThe thought crossed my mind since you mentioned you're at the same work with similar career ambitions, so to his self-serving ass it benefits him to downgrade you in this situation to boost himself. So make sure you get your version out, no need to share details you aren't comfortable with but be sure to emphasis things like \"doctor's orders\" and \"medical advice\" regarding your ability to work at the moment.\n\nPersonally, I can be very damn petty when someone treats me like trash so I'd probably find some way to work in a hint or two that the partner is neglecting you/is being a dirty liar about you.", "Completely understandable. Is it possible that you might actually enjoy becoming a stay-at-home spouse in the future?\n\n\\*I should clarify: I don't mean this in any negative way. I'm only asking because it may be a viable solution for the two of you going forward.", "I don\u2019t mind staying home at all, but I strongly value my financial independence. I\u2019m also not ready to give up my career yet. Despite all my health troubles I\u2019ve actually risen faster than him since finishing my studies, and this is where he says he\u2019s most attracted to me. \n\nLong story short, I think fully remote is as far as I will go for the long term."]}
