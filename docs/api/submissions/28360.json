Some neighbors gathered to complain about my kid.\n\nThey were less than pleased with him drawing with chalk around the streets and onto their perimeter walls (he didn\u2019t enter any properties just drew from the sidewalk). \n\nThe chalk is normal grocery store chalk and washes off extremely easily. If it\u2019s not thickly applied you can even somewhat blow it off. One rain and it\u2019s gone. None of the color stains, nothing stays behind. \n\nThey kept on ranting and I couldn\u2019t contain my chuckling. I usually am pretty strict, but this was just hilarious to me. 3 grown men complaining about a kid drawing flowers and such with chalk. \n\nThey threatened to get the police involved. I told them that I\u2019d love to laugh and chit chat about these completely hysterical complaints with an officer. After that I basically laughed them off the porch.\n\nAs for my kid, I\u2019ll definitely not discipline him for going out there and being a kid, not causing damage or harm, but just chalking some very short lived doodles. I\u2019m more sad for the bitter Stooges who can\u2019t enjoy a childs drawings.
