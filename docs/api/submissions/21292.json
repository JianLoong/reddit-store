You posted this here because you thought you would get karma for your epic clapback. This was not an equal amount of retribution- you were being an asshole on purpose. I would not be surprised if you lost Mary as a friend. \n\nalso... honestly your response does not make sense. You want to live that single no kids fun life, but you slut shame a woman who decided she did want kids? It's so incredibly normal to take age into consideration when having kids that I'm a little confused about what point you were trying to make.", "NTA you know the saying about stones and glass houses? Your 'friend' should take notes", "ESH \n\nNo one has a right to judge you for not wanting to have kids now or ever if that\u2019s your choice. Its your life. Your friend was out of line and an asshole for that comment. You\u2019re response, however, was no better. There are a lot better ways to have responded than going on the attack, especially that vicious of one.", "ESH\n\nThis is a clear case of \"two wrongs don't make a right\".\n\nSuzie was out of line saying you're selfish (you're not and she's wrong on this point), but your retort was designated to hurt her.", "NTA", "ESH. Women are more than just walking wombs, so your friend shouldn\u2019t assume every woman wants to have a child.\n\nBUT you were also out of line for being so damn judgey.", "ESH. Yes, asking someone when they are going to have kids can be a dangerous topic, and calling you selfish after your reply was rude. But, you also stooped to her level with your retaliation. You are no better than Suzie, in my opinion.", "NTA", "NTA - And why do they take it as a personal attack when women say they don\u2019t want any?", "This is my second time ever to post something on Reddit, dont even know how karma works so it wasnt to get karma or a pat on the back.\nIn that moment I thought her comment about me being selfish was incredibly hypocritical since she\u2019s got her kid for her own selfish reasons and that is pretty much it. I did, however, word it badly in the moment but I pretty much stand by what I said.", "I think the point was the friend was just as selfish as the OP--maybe more, in fact.  She created a whole human being to satisfy a want.", "Yep!And why do they think it\u2019s ok to insult you and call people names just because you choose to not have any? NTA", "Probably because they believe that a woman's only desire in life should be to get married be a SAHM and pump out as many children as possible and that should be all the fulfilment in life they need.", "NTA she was rude and harsh first. You just matched her energy. People who like to dish it out can\u2019t never handle taking it back", "NTA. But damn! Straight for the jugular.\n\nStill, calling you selfish for not wanting kids is the most moronic statement people keep spouting", "NTA. People like Suzie are the worst! Enjoy your life, it seems like she doesn\u2019t \ud83d\ude01", "NTA she fucked around and found out. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI\u2019d maybe apologize for taking it far but also include your sentiment about why her comment was inappropriate as well.", "NTA. She fired the first shot.", "NTA!!!! Harsh? Yeah, but I can excuse that.  I hate the question of \"When are you going to have a kid?\"  Well, do you know if I can have kids?  Want kids?  Like kids?  Most people don't know the answers to those questions when they ask the first one.  Which means they just shouldn't ask unless the other person brings it up.  She can bring a tiny human into the world, fine.  But she doesn't get to ask that, then call you selfish for your answer.  You addressed it appropriately, considering she was far more \"selfish\" for her reasoning to bring a tiny human into this world.  This is coming from someone who didn't plan to have kids due to medical problems, but now I have a fantastic son who made my life better.  But, you don't have to have kids if that's not something you want.", "NTA! She wants to judge you for being \u201cselfish\u201d? I think you were completely 100% right to throw that back at her. Also with the state of the world, I\u2019d say putting another human into this world to consume our resources would be more \u201cselfish\u201d that not doing that (I don\u2019t actually think having kids it selfish for the climate, but you get what I mean)", "ESH You really took the dagger out and stabbed through holy shit\ud83d\ude02 she shouldn\u2019t have said that cause honestly, it\u2019s arguably more selfish to have a child than to not.", "NTA - she brought this on herself. People with that mindset suck to out it lightly.", "Having a child because you want one? Selfish. \n\nNot having a child because you don\u2019t want one? Selfish. \n\nLiterally making life choices IS SELFISH. Why are people so obsessed with using that as an insane insult?", "NTA. Not every woman wants a kid. Yes their decision may change, but it seems that you are set on it for right now. How is it selfish of you to NOT have a kid? Suzie asked you a question and you gave back a respectful answer to it then she decided to just straight up insult you. Maybe she\u2019s a bit jealous that you get free time and can spend your money a bit more. And Mary just sat there and let Suzie insult you like that FIRST and then had the audacity to tell YOU to apologize? Sounds like Mary is a pushover or people pleaser. I think you should rethink that friendship because she didn\u2019t stick up for you at all once Suzie called you selfish. \n\nDon\u2019t apologize. Stand your ground. If you apologize, that will let them think they were right and you were wrong. You were the right one, they were the wrong ones", "NTA. I've never understood how not wanting a child is considered selfish.", "OMG. Those questions are entitled, ableist, and clueless af.\n\nYour answer was a little harsh, but I\u2019m sure you are so tired of that.\n\nThe friend who reached out sounds like a good friend.\n\nYou are NTA.", "ESH.\n\nfriend shouldn't have been snotty about you being selfish, but you sure did go nuclear huh.\n\nfor the record: you are NOT selfish for not wanting kids. and I have no idea if she is selfish or not, that isn't my business.", "ESH - you\u2019re not the AH for being upset but your response was an overreaction and cruel. Your friend is an AH for not minding her own business and for calling you selfish for your decision. If you value this friendship, apologize to your friend and explain to her how she also hurt you.", "ESH- it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business whether you want kids, or even whether you can have them. But calling her situation out like that was out of line\u2026", "ESH.  She was out of line with  her selfish comment.  But you responded about as aggresivilley as you could witholut punching her.  Honsetly if you slapped her I would be more likely to say N T A.\n\nThat being said I could see not apologizing at all unless she started with one.", "A soft YTA\n\nI would have said \"I think it is actually more selfish to have a child when you're not absolutely passionate about having one. So me not having a child is actually very self-less in that regard\"\n\nThen you make it a debate about the different interpretations about what selfishness could mean in stead of making it an ad hominem attack on your friend. \n\nYou could have come out of the conversation with dignity and grace with but with ad hominem attacks you always put yourself in a bad light - even when you are in the right (as I believe you were. Your friend's opinion is imo outdated and wrong)\n\nThis is not a catastrophe for you, that's why I say a soft YTA. You had a knee jerk reaction. I know you will do better next time. \ud83d\ude42", "ESH. If you thought it was an inappropriate question you should have said so, not answered it and then torn strips off her.", "Another childfree person here - ESH\n\nSuzie's an AH for prying into someone's personal choices and then being judgy about it. You're an AH for how you responded. There were a hundred different ways to turn it back on her without making a dig about a situation that by your own admission, you probably don't know much about because you're not directly in touch with Suzie anymore. Did she make a crappy life decision out of a desire for kids? Possibly, but deflecting because you felt hurt by her remark (because come on, you were) was an AH move.", "ESH.\n\nHer comment was shitty and clapping back was totally reasonable. But you obliterated her entire life. A bit much imo", "ESH\n\nYou say you and Suzie dont really speak, so it sounds like asking you and her comment about being selfish were the only convo you two have had about the subject. While her comment was uncalled for and makes her an AH, your reply was agressive enough that it honestly sound like there is either a lot more history between you two that finally came tumbeling out, or that you let your general frustration over such questions unleash on one person.\n\nI get it, I've snapped too, its exhausting when people are that single minded and unable to comprehend that some people dont want children. Personally attacking her to that degree feels disproportionate to the context you gave.", "NTA but I agree you could have worded it better. I secretly believe that parents who are insulted that others remain childless are actually jealous of the childless individuals. They regret having kids but can\u2019t admit that so claim the childless individuals are the selfish ones for not wanting to sacrifice their time, health and energy for one. Ultimately it is more selfish to bring a life into this world then to not. That\u2019s another mouth to feed in a dying environment. She is just hurt by your bluntness.", "ESH. Casually asking about having kids isn\u2019t a very weird thing when you\u2019re catching up with friends after a long time, but insisting that other people have to do so is nuts. Calling someone selfish for not doing so is ridiculous. You don\u2019t owe anyone children and people who act like you do are being kind of stupid. \n\nWhat you said to her was a very pointed, personal and frankly mean attack. If I had a friend that vicious, I would have one fewer friend after the interaction.", "NTA", "YTA a slight insult and then you went nuclear.", "ESH - its your right to not have children, and even be annoyed by people expecting it, but your response was far meaner than anything they did.", "ESH.\n\nYou could've been a less harsh. Her comment makes no sense. Selfish to who?", "Ugh having kids is selfish,  there is nothing unselfish about having kids.  You want a mini you and were able to.  \n\nNta", "ESH. She should have not gone there but your response was totally out of place. Seems like you were talking about that at her back and just waiting the moment to point that out.", "ESH leaning more into YTA - She shouldn't be judging you for your (perfectly sensible) life choice, but your response was massively disproportionate and completely unwarranted.   You could have calmly and intelligently explained your reasoning, but you chose to go for a very aggressive personal attack.", "Someone I know (online) had said not wanting kids was selfish or something. I said yea, but it's not a bad thing. If I was told that again I would fully agree that I'm being selfish and that there's tons of benefits to not having them and then depending on how insistent/rude they are I may ask if they were expecting their kids to take care of them when they get older causeeee I have really bad news for them... Especially if that's the only reason they are having kids", "I have no idea but it was annoying before i had kids. We waited almost ten years to have ours (got married young) and the amount of people always asking was irritating. How do they know we werent struggling with infertility? Its crazy!\n\nNTA OP. She opened her mouth and got smacked down. Good for you.", "NTA - and good for you for standing up for yourself", "Misery loves company.", "This made me cackle \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "ESH.\nAbsolutely. There are people who take a certain amount of pride in responding to a nasty remark by being nastier or more vicious. What does it achieve? Does it make you a better person? Do you feel satisfied that you \"won\"? Do you think your adversary will think about the truth of what you said or the attack of your words?\n\nShe had no right to say what she did - and I had kids very late in life so I've heard it all - but you should take no pride in your response.", "I literally see no scenario where not having a kid is selfish. You're creating a sapient being. Not a houseplant", "How is not having a kid selfish?", "No. That's not slut shaming. It's shaming someone for bringing a child into the world with an irresponsible father for the reason of \"I want one\". That's selfish AF and more people should be called out for it. The number of people I have met that have kids because they feel they're \"supposed to\" and not because they actually think they can care for another human being and help foster a healthy development..... absolutely disgusting.", "So was Suzie and as opposed to op she wasn't insulted nor was it any of her business.\n\n\n NTA op. \n\nOp was polite the first two times she answered. \n\nSuzie being agressive judgemental and insulting caused you to answer - a bit harsh but we'll deserved.\n\nCan't take the heat stay the f out of the kitchen. \n\nI was raised to be nice , polite and take the high road, the only thing I got doing that is being a doormat and hurt humiliated while the other person never learns nor adjust their behavior.\n\n Screw that. If you can dish it you better be prepared to take it.", "Mind if I use some of that salt for my mashed potatoes?", "OP didn't push the subject. And maybe just don't fucking ask people when they're having kids. Like you don't ask your fat coworker if they're pregnant. You're hopping on a landmine and hoping its a dud", "Given that she knowingly had a child with a dude that wouldn't be part of the kid's life, Imma say the judgement is fair. That kid got dealt a raw hand before the sperm hit the egg", "Disagree. Op was polite the first two times asked. If Suzie had stopped there it would have been fine. \n\nShe instead started insulting judging op and got a doze of reality. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones and weather op Wants children or not it's none of Suzie s business anyway", "I honestly think they didn't realise not having children was a choice, and now they're mad you don't have to suffer sleepless nights and stress beyond belief like they did/do", "Literally how is it selfish? Who am I depriving of my precious DNA?", "Just make the topic incredibly uncomfortable. Like asking why they're so interested in you unloading inside your wife", "They accomplish making the person too uncomfortable to keep asking such invasive questions and making stupid remarks.", "Because it\u2019s you doing what you want to do? Which is inherently selfish? Not a bad thing btw.", "Sorry, I'm not seeing a damn thing you need to be even remotely apologetic for: strong NTA.", "You are not selfish, you are aware of your limitations and in sync with what you want.", "How is not wanting kids selfish in the slightest? I have never heard a good reason", "Preach!", "Would it also be selfish of parents to get divorced? A woman is perfectly capable of creating a stable environment for a child as a single mother. Sometimes shit happens, and it isn\u2019t necessarily her fault that the father isn\u2019t around.\n\nYou\u2019re bringing up two different groups of people and pretending they\u2019re the same. Why would \u201cI want to have a child\u201d be a bad reason to have a kid, when \u201cI feel like I\u2019m supposed to have a child\u201d is also a bad reason? When are people allowed to have kids then?", "We are  then going to have to agree on disagreeing.\n\nIf the question had been \"Is Suzie an asshole?\" then the answer would be unequivocally yes. Suzie definitely is an asshole\n\nBut the question was \"Is OP the asshole?\". So I am judging her for own behaviour, not Suzies. And my opinion is that she could have handled it so much better, with dignity and grace. But she decided to stoop down on Suzie's level and say something less than flattering. \n\nTherefore in my opinion, a soft YTA.", "Its really not? I'm not depriving anyone of anything. I'm existing and doing something that doesn't affect anyone. That's not selfish.", "We agreed to disagree then. \n\nIf someone is agressive and judgemental with no reason and when it's none of their business after I politely responded and keeps it up , I would also  put that person in her/his place too to stop her/him from verbally attacking me again.\n\nCan't take the heat stay the f out of the kitchen especially after repeated warnings( the polite responses).\n \nI don't believe that makes me an ah as I am defending myself from an aggressive one - who I repeat has no business and is not affected by this issue."]}
