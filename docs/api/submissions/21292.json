I (29f) used to live abroad where I met two girls from my country and we became friends. Let\u2019s call them Suzie (38f) and Mary (29f). Suzie still lives in the country we met in and Mary lives on a different continent now, and I moved back to our country. Me and Mary are in touch and Mary and Suzie are in touch but I and Suzie arent.

The thing is, Mary has a 2 and half-year old and Suzie has a 2-year old. They left the kids with their parents so we can have a drink and not be disturbed by kids, also the kids\u2019 grandparents don\u2019t see them often.\n\nWe had a few drinks (nobody was drunk), caught up on life and then Suzie asked me \u201cSo when are you going to have a child?\u201d.. i am childless by choice so I said \u201cwell, honestly, I dont feel like this is something I want at this point in my life. I mean never say never, but right now I can\u2019t imagine investing all my time, sleep, effort and money into anything else but myself.\u201d To which she said \u201cA little selfish, arent you?\u201d\nHere\u2019s where I may have been an AH as my response was \u201cas opposed to getting knocked up by the first guy you see who is now in prison because you WANTED to have a child because you felt like your time was running out?.. to me, THAT is selfish.\u201d\n\nSuddenly it was very quiet and Mary then changed the subject. Later, Mary messaged me that it was completely unneccessary to say and to apologize..i said i know it may have been worded softer but at the same time, you simply dont ask people a question when they are going to have kids because you never know if that\u2019s something they struggle with and this might be a trigger, and that my first explanation should have been enough for her.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nETA: changed the names, they were too similar.", "created_utc": 1688463758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qamin/aita_for_my_reaction_on_havingnot_having_kids/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You posted this here because you thought you would get karma for your epic clapback. This was not an equal amount of retribution- you were being an asshole on purpose. I would not be surprised if you lost Mary as a friend. \n\nalso... honestly your response does not make sense. You want to live that single no kids fun life, but you slut shame a woman who decided she did want kids? It's so incredibly normal to take age into consideration when having kids that I'm a little confused about what point you were trying to make.", "NTA you know the saying about stones and glass houses? Your 'friend' should take notes", "ESH \n\nNo one has a right to judge you for not wanting to have kids now or ever if that\u2019s your choice. Its your life. Your friend was out of line and an asshole for that comment. You\u2019re response, however, was no better. There are a lot better ways to have responded than going on the attack, especially that vicious of one.", "ESH\n\nThis is a clear case of \"two wrongs don't make a right\".\n\nSuzie was out of line saying you're selfish (you're not and she's wrong on this point), but your retort was designated to hurt her.", "NTA", "ESH. Women are more than just walking wombs, so your friend shouldn\u2019t assume every woman wants to have a child.\n\nBUT you were also out of line for being so damn judgey.", "ESH. Yes, asking someone when they are going to have kids can be a dangerous topic, and calling you selfish after your reply was rude. But, you also stooped to her level with your retaliation. You are no better than Suzie, in my opinion.", "NTA", "NTA - And why do they take it as a personal attack when women say they don\u2019t want any?", "This is my second time ever to post something on Reddit, dont even know how karma works so it wasnt to get karma or a pat on the back.\nIn that moment I thought her comment about me being selfish was incredibly hypocritical since she\u2019s got her kid for her own selfish reasons and that is pretty much it. I did, however, word it badly in the moment but I pretty much stand by what I said.", "I think the point was the friend was just as selfish as the OP--maybe more, in fact.  She created a whole human being to satisfy a want.", "Yep!And why do they think it\u2019s ok to insult you and call people names just because you choose to not have any? NTA", "Probably because they believe that a woman's only desire in life should be to get married be a SAHM and pump out as many children as possible and that should be all the fulfilment in life they need."]}
