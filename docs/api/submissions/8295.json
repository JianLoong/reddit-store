{"id": 8295, "submission_id": "10lhiql", "title": "AITA for publically shaming my brother and his wife for the way they treated us during their visit?", "selftext": " \n\nA few days ago my husband, Dean(m23), his brother Jared(m25), and I(m23) went to Universal Hollywood to see Nintendo World at the soft opening so that we wouldn't have to deal with the crowds. Dean posted a few pictures of us and the various exciting things around. My Sil commented that she doesn't know how to tell her children that their uncles went to see Nintendo World without them. Dean told her to tell them exactly that.\n\nShe then started going on about how lovely it would be to be invited to come visit in May. Dean said no everyone in the house would have finals, and if its going to be anything like last time that was a definite no. She said she was a perfect guest and that we should be happy to welcome her and her whole entourage back into our home. I commented that she hadnt been welcomed in the first place and had locked us out of our room for the entire 2 weeks they had stayed. Dean reminded them that they slept on our bed, stole his money to buy alcohol when he and I were too young to drink, stole both of our clothing, refused to let us study, wanted us to stop going to college so we could drive them everywhere, spilled wine on our white chairs then \"cleaned it up\" by covering it with a white jacket, ruining both, broke multiple dishes and cups without telling us, and that she has her period and bled all over my brand new mattress and didn't bother to clean that up.\n\nI reminded her that I told them that they could come, but they had to stay at a hotel and that in order to have sex on my bed with my brother she tried to get her children to sleep with Jared. A man they now claim is having an incestuous relationship with his brother, my husband. The children had never met Jared before, and either way that's just a strange situation to put him in. Dean followed my comment up by saying that the only way to get them to open the door and take care of their own children was because I had shoulder-rammed the door, (strong ass door, i barely cracked the thing).\n\nMy brother came back saying that he had bought us dinner, to which Dean said yeah you complained the entire time and then stole money from \\[his\\] secret savings to buy beer. The amount of money that was stolen was way more than the cost of the dinner. Sil's mother then joined saying how disgusting it is that we don't want our nieces to enjoy the things that LA has to offer. Dean told her they were welcome to get a hotel and not bother us during finals week which wasn't good enough because we need to drive them everywhere.\n\nMy mom then joined the comments saying that she expected this behavior from Dean but not from me, that we need to find time to spend with our family, and need to apologize to everyone immediately.\n\nDean and Dean think I was wrong to stop him from cussing everyone out, but otherwise that I am fine. However, everyone near them thinks Dean and I are the assholes for publically shaming them and letting Dean talk about how she had her period while on her trip. Did I go too far?

You owe her and all these folks nothing, and if they're too immature to be happy for loved ones having good times they aren't, they can block your social media. Don't let them walk all over you again.\n\nETA: NTA.", "NTA!!   \n\n\nYour family members are being absolutely appalling. You did not say they couldn't come, you set a reasonable time you wouldn't be available for such a get together. They are being pushy, rude, and immature. They've already abused you and your husband and your home once, and they should be ashamed of themselves hauling the parents into this. You are an adult, you don't answer to your parents anymore like that. This is your home and family, YOU make the decisions who comes and who goes and WHEN. They deserved the blast they got. Neither of the parents should have involved themselves. And you have every right to tell the parents to back off.", "NTA.  And I gotta say, worst guests ever!  I did get a little confused on how your mom and your brother jumped in this conversation.  I thought you were at the Nintendo thing, just the three of you.

I certainly wouldn't have them back after what they did the last time they stayed with you. Anyone who steals from me is automatically never to be trusted again.\n\nYou are all very young and it is a good time for you to get comfortable setting boundaries since it seems your family doesn't have any. You never have to allow anyone to stay in your home ever. If they have disrespected you, your home, and your belongings before they will do it again. You would be a sucker to let them take advantage of you again. Don't let your family use guilt to manipulate you into doing what they want. Once you recognize the manipulation you will be less likely to succumb to it.", ">Dean and Dean think I was wrong to stop him from cussing everyone out\n\nCome again?\n\nNTA\n\nDo your Mom and MIL just ignore what happened last time? What is their response to the HORRENDOUS way they treated your home and you personally? Would they invite them into their home to be treated like this? If they are so concerned with having the kids \"see everything LA has to offer\" why don't they plan a trip where the inconvenience is on them to put up with all of the nonsense?

Not only are you not the AH for calling out such disgusting and outrageous behavior, your mother is just as bad as they are for telling you to apologize.
