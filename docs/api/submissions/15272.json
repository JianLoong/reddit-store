She was a teen mom and had broken up with my dad, he was in the army stationed somewhere in Europe. It was just us and we were really close. I love my dad but we're not that close. When I went to university, at first I'd come home very weekend and whenever I could. But about a year in, my mom had a surprise, my dad moved back to the city and they'd started dating again.\n\nAnd at first I was happy. What eighteen year old doesn't want that? And they've been together for so long now and I'm happy they found their way back to each other. But things are different. They got married and then they had two other kids. And after they had them, I guess I started seeing just how much I didn't have. And I hate it. I hate it so much. I don't care that it's not their fault, or that they're little kids who don't know better. If my dad had come home sooner, I could have had that and I'm smart enough to know that it's better to stay away than feel like that. And beyond that, they honestly seem like brats to me.\n\nSo, it's been about four years now since I've visited for more than a day trip. Since I'm getting married in December, my mom wants all four of us to go on one actual family vacation. The kids want to go to Disney World and she wants me to come along. I just told her there's no way I'm going anywhere unless it's just me and her, maybe dad. I admitted I'm not going to come just to see those kids that the childhood I should have had.\n\nI could tell that made her cry but she hid it from me and my dad texted me later that she's crying and he doesn't know why and asked me to call to help out. I hate that I made her cry but what should I do? Keep hiding how I feel and go on a vacation where I'll be miserable?\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo everybody parroting 'therapy' like a broken record.

You did absolutely nothing morally wrong telling her how you feel. I think it's good that you tell her the truth about how you feel, just so your parents' have a chance to make amends.

She can\u2019t just pretend life is peachy.  Your mom and dad made some mistakes and you paid for them. Is it your siblings fault? No but being absent from their life is better then being openly resentful.\n\nYour parents became better for your siblings. Yes your an adult but that has to hurt. And your feeling mater also. And it\u2019s ok to be mad at them for not getting their shit together sooner. It\u2019s ok to be mad at them for not being the parents to you they are to your siblings. \n\nSo here is some words of wisdom. Get a therapist work through your childhood. Work through your anger and resentment. Given the age difference you still may never want to be in your siblings life. Your parents chose to have kids at least 18 years apart. They should have known that this wasn\u2019t going to be a traditional sibling relationship.

And that you have little to no emotional feelings for your younger siblings. A bit harsh, but true.\n\nYou are an adult now & have your own life.

Your feelings of abandonment are valid.", "OP, I hate to say YTA, and what I\u2019m gojng to say will probably be unpopular, but you\u2019re asking for feedback and validation here, yet repudiating every suggestion quite tersely, which is assholish. \n\nYou\u2019re angry, resentful, unwilling to flex, and now in retrospect, you\u2019re willing to torch it all for your childhood, one that your mother couldn\u2019t help, though she did the best she could at the time, as you admit. \n\nYou might want to take a step back and\u2026 I dunno, \u2018process\u2019 isn\u2019t quite the word\u2026 but really take a look from 20,000 feet. Look at the big picture and your future. Do you want to go through life angry? Dump your parents and sibs? What can change it? You don\u2019t need a therapist to do self-reflection and figure out how to flex. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it has to be perfect happy family time, because your feelings are legit, but the deep seated smoldering is threatening to burst into flame here. \n\nAlso, maybe take into consideration that being angry all the time, punishing kids that can\u2019t help the situation, and resenting your dad breezing back into your mother\u2019s life, is becoming all-consuming and becoming a personality trait rather than a set of unfair events.

She was a teen mom and had broken up with my dad, he was in the army stationed somewhere in Europe. It was just us and we were really close. I love my dad but we're not that close. When I went to university, at first I'd come home very weekend and whenever I could.

And beyond that, they honestly seem like brats to me.\n\nSo, it's been about four years now since I've visited for more than a day trip. Since I'm getting married in December, my mom wants all four of us to go on one actual family vacation. The kids want to go to Disney World and she wants me to come along. I just told her there's no way I'm going anywhere unless it's just me and her, maybe dad. I admitted I'm not going to come just to see those kids that the childhood I should have had. \n\nI could tell that made her cry but she hid it from me and my dad texted me later that she's crying and he doesn't know why and asked me to call to help out.

I think what you\u2019re experiencing is not so much resentment, but actual grief for what you missed out on. \n\nI know people like to throw in therapy as a recommendation for basically everything, but individual therapy to talk through these feelings, would most likely be beneficial. If you can process them better, they will probably bother you less. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re gonna want to start being a big, happy family or anything, but it would probably have value for you. \n\nIt\u2019s also perfectly fine not to wanna be close to your siblings, or just casually visit from time to time. Given the age difference, even if you didn\u2019t resent them it\u2019s pretty unrealistic that you\u2019d grow up closer anything", "NTA.

You have to be sure that it\u2019s worth it. Ultimately though, it\u2019s your decision and you have to live with it. Your mother and father will also have to accept your decision.

Could your life have been better?  Of course. But it sounds like your mom did the best she could. Gave you what she had to give.  I'm sorry you hold such anger in your heart.  Your best option is to go and live your best life. Let the past go or it'll always haunt you. I hope you find peace at some point. Joy in your future.", "NAH\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to call anyone an AH (with the possible exception of your father); you clearly have a lot of pain and unresolved issues from your childhood. You didn't get the childhood you deserved, and it hurts to see your siblings get exactly what you had always wanted. Perfectly understandable.\n\nYour mother (and possibly your father, I don't think we have enough info about him) tried her best when you were young, but obviously she didn't have the resources (emotional or financial) to give you what she is giving your siblings.\n\nWhen they got back together, all was good, but it doesn't seem like either of them ever tried to make amends, which I think is were all of your resentment comes from. You were presented with a situation with \"This is how it is now, isn't it great?\" without anyone considering you would feel.\n\nOF COURSE you're upset. And you certainly don't have to go on the vacation. It would have been nice if they had designed the vacation with you in mind as opposed to only your siblings, which I imagine magnified your reaction to it. But that didn't happen.\n\nI think the only way forward is to have a frank conversation with your parents, as other commenters have advised. They may not realize how difficult you are finding this whole situation, expecting that you would be happy about it (at least I hope that's the case, otherwise they're definitely TA).\n\nI don't think it's realistic to have a super-close relationship with your siblings given the age gap under the best of circumstances; but your resentment will make this even more difficult. And you don't have to have a close relationship with them. I actually agree with you that distancing yourself from them may be more beneficial TO THEM because of your (understandable) issues about the situation. You don't want them to feel that you don't like or love them (even if that's the case) because of your actions. It's easy to explain to kids that their older sister can't come around much because she's beginning a journey with her husband, who is now her primary family member.\n\nAnother commenter suggested a family vacation that's a bit less kid-centric after your wedding, with your husband, which I think would be a fantastic idea if you're up to it. You would not be stuck with the emotional baggage of the original vacation, and you and your husband would be able to do \"couple\" things to get a break from the kids. And you would definitely cement your relationship with your parents (and your siblings to a degree) as part of the family. This might help your mother, but more importantly, if you want to maintain a relationship with your parents, it will show them that you will meet them halfway.\n\nBut if you need to distance yourself from your family for a while, that's okay too. I would still have a talk with your parents to let them know why, and that you're trying to work through this. Your job right now is to think of what your end goal is for your familial relationships--where do you want them to be in 5 years? 10? 20? And then slowly work towards that goal, keeping your mental health top of mind.", "Soft YTA. I am so sorry you are watching your siblings get a childhood you wanted and blaming your parents. You said your parents were teen parents, so even if you Dad had stuck around your childhood, could have still sucked. If you have children, do you plan to give them the best childhood you can? Would it be hard to watch them grow up differently than you? Your parents getting back together as mature adults and expanding their family is hard for you, and it is ok to feel that way.

They are valid. \n\nDon't do something that will make you miserable just to make your mom smile.", "light YTA, look most older siblings see a stark contrast to how they were raised compared to their younger siblings- it's natural, most parents have their shit together better later in life and can provide better not just financially but emotional support, advice etc. Do I sometimes resent the fact my parents spoiled and were so much more patient, understanding and easygoing on my sister who is a decade younger, sometimes yea, but then I remember it's not really anyone's fault. My parents were in a completely different position when I was little. They were young, broke, ignorant, unequipped.  People learn over time and through experience, life situations change.  It doesn't look like you were abused, unloved, abandoned or wronged in any way, for the most part you lived the normal life of someone with a parent in the service or someone with divorced parents. I get having some jealousy or slight resentment but to not even be able to be in your siblings presence for more than a day because you can't stand to see them with a more ideal childhood than yourself? It's sad. You should be glad for them that they don't have to deal some of what you went through. I'm sure it wouldn't make you happy to see your parents suddenly divorce and put the kids through shit would it? So please get some therapy because honestly most people need it, but it's clear you're struggling with how to come to terms with the shift. I get the need or desire to want one on one time with your mom too since you had such a close relationship with just yourselves for so long (I'm a single mom to a girl myself) but I'd advise you to try and open your heart and keep open the path to a closer relationship with your siblings too. Just my opinion but as you get older I think you'll value them more.", "Nope, NTA. And yes, you should be honest with your parents about how you feel. You don\u2019t need to be mean or cruel, but they do need to know. And additionally, you can also just be angry at a situation and not need therapy. That said, when you can\u2019t move beyond that anger, when it impacts healthy, loving relationships (like what you describe with your mom), it\u2019s something that perhaps therapy could help with. \n\nI\u2019ll also add this. I have NO idea why parents decide it\u2019s a great idea to have more kids many years after their first group of kids. Like, it\u2019s almost ALWAYS going to impact the existing children negatively. And the parents always seem to be surprised when their older kids react negatively. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry, OP. But don\u2019t hide your feelings.", "NTA. I mean you\u2019re being honest. I love your therapy toenails line.", "NTA.  You're 28.  If you don't want to go on a 'family' vacation, you shouldn't have to.  Yes, I think you should at least work on trying to spend time with your siblings, but you were already an adult and in college when they were born.  It isn't like you have anything in common.", "IMO, NTA. Look, therapy helps for a lot but it doesn't necessarily \\*fix\\* or \\*cure\\* things, despite some peoples' beliefs on it. I've gone to therapy for years so that I can be in the same room as my family without flying off the handle, but it doesn't mean I don't need immense time to prepare myself emotionally before going, and spend days decompressing, processing, and crying when I get back. If you were forcing yourself into all of the scenarios and using the opportunity to be abusive to the children, that would be very much not okay. But saying that \"what I want is time with you and my dad without my siblings because that's what I never got to have,\" is fine and reasonable. If not having a relationship with your siblings is what you need to do to preserve your emotional well-being, fine. There are siblings with much less baggage involved who don't talk to each other, and it's not necessarily the bad or sad thing that lots of people here make it out to be.

I do however want to ask what your end goal is. \n\nLet's say that your parents were together through your childhood (you said your dad was in your life just not around very much). Say they got married and he was around, however (given the fact they were probably young when they had you) they couldn't afford extras like trips or luxury items. They still supported you as best they could. Then, several years later when they were more established and financially secure, they had more kids. Obviously because thier circumstances are different, they can afford better for their younger kids. Would you expect them to give your siblings less to be \"fair\" even though the circumstances were completely different?\n\nNo set of kids will have the same upbringing because time changes circumstances. Is it fair? No. But neither is life. Your siblings aren't getting the childhood you could have had. Even together,  your parents would not have been able to afford what they can now. Are they getting a better childhood? Maybe, but that could be said of any stranger on the street. \n\nYou can continue with the mindset that seeing your siblings grow up under better circumstances is a slap in the face and painful. It's your right to feel how you want. I will say that keeping yourself isolated from your family will have consequences and you may find that you're always on the outside looking in.\n\nYou could change your mindset to accept the fact that people and circumstances change. That just because you're an adult doesn't mean you can't enjoy kid things. Lots of people fulfill dreams they had as kids when they're adults. You can put aside your disappointment of the past (which isn't going to change) and embrace a family that wants you. It doesn't sound like they are pushing you aside; it sounds like they want to include all of thier kids.\n\nUltimately, you are the one who will live with your choices.

Because of course, it was different when your parents aren\u2019t struggling and poor enough for government assistance. \n\nI guess I\u2019m  mature enough to recognize that everyone was doing the best they could with the resources they had at the time and how foolish it would be to torch my relationship with my immediate family over jealousy for reality that cannot, and could never have, existed.\n\nOp has a fantasy of what her child would\u2019ve been like in her head. And rather than recognize this falsehood, she is blaming everyone for it. \n\nI guess her parents could\u2019ve gotten together and had her 18 years later \u2026 so she wouldn\u2019t have the life she has now and she wouldn\u2019t be getting married. I mean it\u2019s like the damn Butterfly Effect.", "Then honestly- why post here? You don\u2019t care about your siblings, you\u2019re having a child free wedding (how\u2019s that going to work out if you want both your parents there and they can\u2019t find a sitter?), and you\u2019ve set your boundaries. Just don\u2019t be surprised if and when your parents set theirs, and they don\u2019t involve keeping you from ever having to see or spend time with your siblings.", "OP in the comments specifically said she is close to her Dad. Not like her mom, but they talk every single night.", "It should give her perspective . It\u2019s not like her siblings were there when op was living with a single mom\n op was not being forced to sacrifice things for the sake of the younger children. They did not exist at the time. But they  exist now. They deserve to exist. And they deserve a good life.", "Yeah, which is the situation the situation is her resenting her parents for giving her siblings, what she always wanted in her childhood. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say and also the her dad not being there", "I'm saying the OP noted that the younger kids are spoiled as it is so Disneyland is probably extra torture for the OP.", "OP is not wrong for wanting time alone with her parents, and she is not wrong for not wanting to spend time with her siblings.  You all are reaching haaaaard to make OP the villain here, and it\u2019s toxic as hell", "Yeah, I've commented a few times, but OP is refusing judgements that she doesn't like. Why even post here? \"I didn't do anything wrong, and I don't care, so I can't be an asshole. Oh, but am I the asshole?\"\n\nAlso, idk how she thinks she's not hurting those kids? She spends time with her parents apparently a good amount? Who obviously dont always have a sitter, so OP is around them more than she wants to admit. And is so openly resentful of those kids that every stranger on reddit knows? And thinks her behavior *doesn't* affect them? Like, I know she's delusional because she thinks she's \"moved on\" and isn't resentful, but damn.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like her siblings were there when op was living with a single mom\u201d\n\nBingo, that\u2019s a reason why OP has these feelings. She has had a completely different childhood than what her siblings are having which is why she has these feelings.", "Yes so as you say she also resent her parents specifically her dad as his actions directly caused the situation. It wasn\u2019t a coincidence. Even when op said no to her mom she said only a day with her and maybe her dad showing she still resents him more", "Actually OPs comments did that. I was planning a NAH vote, until every commenter was met with self righteous, bitter anger", "If this is the route you go, make sure you talk with your therapist and temper your expectations for the trip. Idk what kind of parents yours are now, but some can get anxious and won\u2019t relax when they leave their kids (aka don\u2019t stop calling the babysitter or always bring up \u201ckid x would love this\u201d. Some of it is of course normal but some people are excessive about it). Make sure your mentally prepared just in case your parents aren\u2019t mentally focused on the trip and you. I\u2019m really rooting for you and hoping this isn\u2019t the case but it\u2019s always best to be prepared just in case. \nYour situation sounds really familiar to an episode of the good place (s3e06). I know for me, it can be helpful to see similar situations in media as a way of processing so I just wanted to recommend this episode (although for some people watching similar media can be triggering). \nNta btw. It seems as though your parents think of your childhood differently/don\u2019t want to listen to and accept your feelings because it makes them feel guilty. Family therapy might be the only way to make them hear what you\u2019re saying but there\u2019s no guarantees so only you can decide if it would be worth your time and effort. This is a case of the axe forgets but the tree remembers.", "It feels like she thinks if she says it enough, she\u2019ll eventually believe it.", "Jealousy of children as an adult? Come on. Grow up. These children are not her enemy. Her siblings are not having a perfect  life or getting everything they want. It\u2019s not possible. She is projecting onto her siblings and blaming them for existing. Blaming her mother for continuing to live her life the best she can. And her mom isn\u2019t rejecting op. Her mom wants to make op feel welcomed loved. Op is like nah I ll pass because you were single mom.", "Yeah, it happens. I can see why she resents her dad a little bit more than her mom. I think a op said that her dad wasn\u2019t much involved or didn\u2019t really contribute as much towards her so I can understand why. I think I\u2019m just going off assumption butI might just be wrong. I feel like if her dad was present as much as her mom, she wouldn\u2019t be resentful at all or not as much. But because she saw her dad being so happy and doing all family stuff with her siblings, she just hated it.", "Nope, you\u2019re just projecting your own toxicity onto her, lol", "And rightfully so to be bitter. If you can do it, she can do it."]}
