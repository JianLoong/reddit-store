She was a teen mom and had broken up with my dad, he was in the army stationed somewhere in Europe. It was just us and we were really close. I love my dad but we're not that close. When I went to university, at first I'd come home very weekend and whenever I could. But about a year in, my mom had a surprise, my dad moved back to the city and they'd started dating again.\n\nAnd at first I was happy. What eighteen year old doesn't want that? And they've been together for so long now and I'm happy they found their way back to each other. But things are different. They got married and then they had two other kids. And after they had them, I guess I started seeing just how much I didn't have. And I hate it. I hate it so much. I don't care that it's not their fault, or that they're little kids who don't know better. If my dad had come home sooner, I could have had that and I'm smart enough to know that it's better to stay away than feel like that. And beyond that, they honestly seem like brats to me.\n\nSo, it's been about four years now since I've visited for more than a day trip. Since I'm getting married in December, my mom wants all four of us to go on one actual family vacation. The kids want to go to Disney World and she wants me to come along. I just told her there's no way I'm going anywhere unless it's just me and her, maybe dad. I admitted I'm not going to come just to see those kids that the childhood I should have had.\n\nI could tell that made her cry but she hid it from me and my dad texted me later that she's crying and he doesn't know why and asked me to call to help out. I hate that I made her cry but what should I do? Keep hiding how I feel and go on a vacation where I'll be miserable?\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo everybody parroting 'therapy' like a broken record.

There's nothing wrong with your mom trying to get you to build a relationship with your new siblings, especially since this is sort of like the opportunity for her to give you the family you never had.\n\nThat being said, your feelings are completely valid. You did absolutely nothing morally wrong telling her how you feel. I think it's good that you tell her the truth about how you feel, just so your parents' have a chance to make amends. You did lose out on certain aspects of childhood, and it's perfectly reasonable that you feel jealous your siblings get to experience that when you didn't.\n\nIn my opinion, you do deserve a vacation with just your parents. I think the three of you should definitely do that before your wedding.

She can\u2019t just pretend life is peachy.  Your mom and dad made some mistakes and you paid for them. Is it your siblings fault? No but being absent from their life is better then being openly resentful.\n\nYour parents became better for your siblings. Yes your an adult but that has to hurt. And your feeling mater also. And it\u2019s ok to be mad at them for not getting their shit together sooner. It\u2019s ok to be mad at them for not being the parents to you they are to your siblings. \n\nSo here is some words of wisdom. Get a therapist work through your childhood. Work through your anger and resentment. Given the age difference you still may never want to be in your siblings life. Your parents chose to have kids at least 18 years apart. They should have known that this wasn\u2019t going to be a traditional sibling relationship.

And that you have little to no emotional feelings for your younger siblings. A bit harsh, but true.\n\nYou are an adult now & have your own life.

Your feelings of abandonment are valid.", "OP, I hate to say YTA, and what I\u2019m gojng to say will probably be unpopular, but you\u2019re asking for feedback and validation here, yet repudiating every suggestion quite tersely, which is assholish. \n\nYou\u2019re angry, resentful, unwilling to flex, and now in retrospect, you\u2019re willing to torch it all for your childhood, one that your mother couldn\u2019t help, though she did the best she could at the time, as you admit. \n\nYou might want to take a step back and\u2026 I dunno, \u2018process\u2019 isn\u2019t quite the word\u2026 but really take a look from 20,000 feet. Look at the big picture and your future. Do you want to go through life angry? Dump your parents and sibs? What can change it? You don\u2019t need a therapist to do self-reflection and figure out how to flex. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it has to be perfect happy family time, because your feelings are legit, but the deep seated smoldering is threatening to burst into flame here. \n\nAlso, maybe take into consideration that being angry all the time, punishing kids that can\u2019t help the situation, and resenting your dad breezing back into your mother\u2019s life, is becoming all-consuming and becoming a personality trait rather than a set of unfair events.

She was a teen mom and had broken up with my dad, he was in the army stationed somewhere in Europe. It was just us and we were really close. I love my dad but we're not that close. When I went to university, at first I'd come home very weekend and whenever I could.

If my dad had come home sooner, I could have had that and I'm smart enough to know that it's better to stay away than feel like that. And beyond that, they honestly seem like brats to me.\n\nSo, it's been about four years now since I've visited for more than a day trip. Since I'm getting married in December, my mom wants all four of us to go on one actual family vacation. The kids want to go to Disney World and she wants me to come along. I just told her there's no way I'm going anywhere unless it's just me and her, maybe dad. I admitted I'm not going to come just to see those kids that the childhood I should have had. \n\nI could tell that made her cry but she hid it from me and my dad texted me later that she's crying and he doesn't know why and asked me to call to help out. I hate that I made her cry but what should I do? Keep hiding how I feel and go on a vacation where I'll be miserable?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can wish, you can want, you can whine and hate everyone around and throw a tantrum over what you didn\u2019t have, but inflicting pain on people purposely when they cannot change a thing is cruel.
