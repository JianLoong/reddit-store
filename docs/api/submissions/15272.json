She was a teen mom and had broken up with my dad, he was in the army stationed somewhere in Europe. It was just us and we were really close. I love my dad but we're not that close. When I went to university, at first I'd come home very weekend and whenever I could. But about a year in, my mom had a surprise, my dad moved back to the city and they'd started dating again.\n\nAnd at first I was happy. What eighteen year old doesn't want that? And they've been together for so long now and I'm happy they found their way back to each other. But things are different. They got married and then they had two other kids. And after they had them, I guess I started seeing just how much I didn't have. And I hate it. I hate it so much. I don't care that it's not their fault, or that they're little kids who don't know better. If my dad had come home sooner, I could have had that and I'm smart enough to know that it's better to stay away than feel like that. And beyond that, they honestly seem like brats to me.\n\nSo, it's been about four years now since I've visited for more than a day trip. Since I'm getting married in December, my mom wants all four of us to go on one actual family vacation. The kids want to go to Disney World and she wants me to come along. I just told her there's no way I'm going anywhere unless it's just me and her, maybe dad. I admitted I'm not going to come just to see those kids that the childhood I should have had.\n\nI could tell that made her cry but she hid it from me and my dad texted me later that she's crying and he doesn't know why and asked me to call to help out. I hate that I made her cry but what should I do? Keep hiding how I feel and go on a vacation where I'll be miserable?\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo everybody parroting 'therapy' like a broken record.

You did absolutely nothing morally wrong telling her how you feel. I think it's good that you tell her the truth about how you feel, just so your parents' have a chance to make amends.

She can\u2019t just pretend life is peachy.  Your mom and dad made some mistakes and you paid for them. Is it your siblings fault? No but being absent from their life is better then being openly resentful.\n\nYour parents became better for your siblings. Yes your an adult but that has to hurt. And your feeling mater also. And it\u2019s ok to be mad at them for not getting their shit together sooner. It\u2019s ok to be mad at them for not being the parents to you they are to your siblings. \n\nSo here is some words of wisdom. Get a therapist work through your childhood. Work through your anger and resentment. Given the age difference you still may never want to be in your siblings life. Your parents chose to have kids at least 18 years apart. They should have known that this wasn\u2019t going to be a traditional sibling relationship.

And that you have little to no emotional feelings for your younger siblings. A bit harsh, but true.\n\nYou are an adult now & have your own life.

Your feelings of abandonment are valid.", "OP, I hate to say YTA, and what I\u2019m gojng to say will probably be unpopular, but you\u2019re asking for feedback and validation here, yet repudiating every suggestion quite tersely, which is assholish. \n\nYou\u2019re angry, resentful, unwilling to flex, and now in retrospect, you\u2019re willing to torch it all for your childhood, one that your mother couldn\u2019t help, though she did the best she could at the time, as you admit. \n\nYou might want to take a step back and\u2026 I dunno, \u2018process\u2019 isn\u2019t quite the word\u2026 but really take a look from 20,000 feet. Look at the big picture and your future. Do you want to go through life angry? Dump your parents and sibs? What can change it? You don\u2019t need a therapist to do self-reflection and figure out how to flex. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it has to be perfect happy family time, because your feelings are legit, but the deep seated smoldering is threatening to burst into flame here. \n\nAlso, maybe take into consideration that being angry all the time, punishing kids that can\u2019t help the situation, and resenting your dad breezing back into your mother\u2019s life, is becoming all-consuming and becoming a personality trait rather than a set of unfair events.

She was a teen mom and had broken up with my dad, he was in the army stationed somewhere in Europe. It was just us and we were really close. I love my dad but we're not that close. When I went to university, at first I'd come home very weekend and whenever I could.

And beyond that, they honestly seem like brats to me.\n\nSo, it's been about four years now since I've visited for more than a day trip. Since I'm getting married in December, my mom wants all four of us to go on one actual family vacation. The kids want to go to Disney World and she wants me to come along. I just told her there's no way I'm going anywhere unless it's just me and her, maybe dad. I admitted I'm not going to come just to see those kids that the childhood I should have had. \n\nI could tell that made her cry but she hid it from me and my dad texted me later that she's crying and he doesn't know why and asked me to call to help out.

I think what you\u2019re experiencing is not so much resentment, but actual grief for what you missed out on. \n\nI know people like to throw in therapy as a recommendation for basically everything, but individual therapy to talk through these feelings, would most likely be beneficial. If you can process them better, they will probably bother you less. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re gonna want to start being a big, happy family or anything, but it would probably have value for you. \n\nIt\u2019s also perfectly fine not to wanna be close to your siblings, or just casually visit from time to time. Given the age difference, even if you didn\u2019t resent them it\u2019s pretty unrealistic that you\u2019d grow up closer anything", "NTA.

You have to be sure that it\u2019s worth it. Ultimately though, it\u2019s your decision and you have to live with it. Your mother and father will also have to accept your decision.

Could your life have been better?  Of course. But it sounds like your mom did the best she could. Gave you what she had to give.  I'm sorry you hold such anger in your heart.  Your best option is to go and live your best life. Let the past go or it'll always haunt you. I hope you find peace at some point. Joy in your future.", "NAH\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to call anyone an AH (with the possible exception of your father); you clearly have a lot of pain and unresolved issues from your childhood. You didn't get the childhood you deserved, and it hurts to see your siblings get exactly what you had always wanted. Perfectly understandable.\n\nYour mother (and possibly your father, I don't think we have enough info about him) tried her best when you were young, but obviously she didn't have the resources (emotional or financial) to give you what she is giving your siblings.\n\nWhen they got back together, all was good, but it doesn't seem like either of them ever tried to make amends, which I think is were all of your resentment comes from. You were presented with a situation with \"This is how it is now, isn't it great?\" without anyone considering you would feel.\n\nOF COURSE you're upset. And you certainly don't have to go on the vacation. It would have been nice if they had designed the vacation with you in mind as opposed to only your siblings, which I imagine magnified your reaction to it. But that didn't happen.\n\nI think the only way forward is to have a frank conversation with your parents, as other commenters have advised. They may not realize how difficult you are finding this whole situation, expecting that you would be happy about it (at least I hope that's the case, otherwise they're definitely TA).\n\nI don't think it's realistic to have a super-close relationship with your siblings given the age gap under the best of circumstances; but your resentment will make this even more difficult. And you don't have to have a close relationship with them. I actually agree with you that distancing yourself from them may be more beneficial TO THEM because of your (understandable) issues about the situation. You don't want them to feel that you don't like or love them (even if that's the case) because of your actions. It's easy to explain to kids that their older sister can't come around much because she's beginning a journey with her husband, who is now her primary family member.\n\nAnother commenter suggested a family vacation that's a bit less kid-centric after your wedding, with your husband, which I think would be a fantastic idea if you're up to it. You would not be stuck with the emotional baggage of the original vacation, and you and your husband would be able to do \"couple\" things to get a break from the kids. And you would definitely cement your relationship with your parents (and your siblings to a degree) as part of the family. This might help your mother, but more importantly, if you want to maintain a relationship with your parents, it will show them that you will meet them halfway.\n\nBut if you need to distance yourself from your family for a while, that's okay too. I would still have a talk with your parents to let them know why, and that you're trying to work through this. Your job right now is to think of what your end goal is for your familial relationships--where do you want them to be in 5 years? 10? 20? And then slowly work towards that goal, keeping your mental health top of mind.", "Soft YTA. I am so sorry you are watching your siblings get a childhood you wanted and blaming your parents. You said your parents were teen parents, so even if you Dad had stuck around your childhood, could have still sucked. If you have children, do you plan to give them the best childhood you can? Would it be hard to watch them grow up differently than you? Your parents getting back together as mature adults and expanding their family is hard for you, and it is ok to feel that way.

They are valid. \n\nDon't do something that will make you miserable just to make your mom smile.", "light YTA, look most older siblings see a stark contrast to how they were raised compared to their younger siblings- it's natural, most parents have their shit together better later in life and can provide better not just financially but emotional support, advice etc. Do I sometimes resent the fact my parents spoiled and were so much more patient, understanding and easygoing on my sister who is a decade younger, sometimes yea, but then I remember it's not really anyone's fault. My parents were in a completely different position when I was little. They were young, broke, ignorant, unequipped.  People learn over time and through experience, life situations change.  It doesn't look like you were abused, unloved, abandoned or wronged in any way, for the most part you lived the normal life of someone with a parent in the service or someone with divorced parents. I get having some jealousy or slight resentment but to not even be able to be in your siblings presence for more than a day because you can't stand to see them with a more ideal childhood than yourself? It's sad. You should be glad for them that they don't have to deal some of what you went through. I'm sure it wouldn't make you happy to see your parents suddenly divorce and put the kids through shit would it? So please get some therapy because honestly most people need it, but it's clear you're struggling with how to come to terms with the shift. I get the need or desire to want one on one time with your mom too since you had such a close relationship with just yourselves for so long (I'm a single mom to a girl myself) but I'd advise you to try and open your heart and keep open the path to a closer relationship with your siblings too. Just my opinion but as you get older I think you'll value them more.", "Nope, NTA. And yes, you should be honest with your parents about how you feel. You don\u2019t need to be mean or cruel, but they do need to know. And additionally, you can also just be angry at a situation and not need therapy. That said, when you can\u2019t move beyond that anger, when it impacts healthy, loving relationships (like what you describe with your mom), it\u2019s something that perhaps therapy could help with. \n\nI\u2019ll also add this. I have NO idea why parents decide it\u2019s a great idea to have more kids many years after their first group of kids. Like, it\u2019s almost ALWAYS going to impact the existing children negatively. And the parents always seem to be surprised when their older kids react negatively. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry, OP. But don\u2019t hide your feelings.", "NTA. I mean you\u2019re being honest. I love your therapy toenails line.", "NTA.  You're 28.  If you don't want to go on a 'family' vacation, you shouldn't have to.  Yes, I think you should at least work on trying to spend time with your siblings, but you were already an adult and in college when they were born.  It isn't like you have anything in common.", "IMO, NTA. Look, therapy helps for a lot but it doesn't necessarily \\*fix\\* or \\*cure\\* things, despite some peoples' beliefs on it. I've gone to therapy for years so that I can be in the same room as my family without flying off the handle, but it doesn't mean I don't need immense time to prepare myself emotionally before going, and spend days decompressing, processing, and crying when I get back. If you were forcing yourself into all of the scenarios and using the opportunity to be abusive to the children, that would be very much not okay. But saying that \"what I want is time with you and my dad without my siblings because that's what I never got to have,\" is fine and reasonable. If not having a relationship with your siblings is what you need to do to preserve your emotional well-being, fine. There are siblings with much less baggage involved who don't talk to each other, and it's not necessarily the bad or sad thing that lots of people here make it out to be.

I do however want to ask what your end goal is. \n\nLet's say that your parents were together through your childhood (you said your dad was in your life just not around very much). Say they got married and he was around, however (given the fact they were probably young when they had you) they couldn't afford extras like trips or luxury items. They still supported you as best they could. Then, several years later when they were more established and financially secure, they had more kids. Obviously because thier circumstances are different, they can afford better for their younger kids. Would you expect them to give your siblings less to be \"fair\" even though the circumstances were completely different?\n\nNo set of kids will have the same upbringing because time changes circumstances. Is it fair? No. But neither is life. Your siblings aren't getting the childhood you could have had. Even together,  your parents would not have been able to afford what they can now. Are they getting a better childhood? Maybe, but that could be said of any stranger on the street. \n\nYou can continue with the mindset that seeing your siblings grow up under better circumstances is a slap in the face and painful. It's your right to feel how you want. I will say that keeping yourself isolated from your family will have consequences and you may find that you're always on the outside looking in.\n\nYou could change your mindset to accept the fact that people and circumstances change. That just because you're an adult doesn't mean you can't enjoy kid things. Lots of people fulfill dreams they had as kids when they're adults. You can put aside your disappointment of the past (which isn't going to change) and embrace a family that wants you. It doesn't sound like they are pushing you aside; it sounds like they want to include all of thier kids.\n\nUltimately, you are the one who will live with your choices.

So they came to live with mom and my stepfather. I was 19 by this time and married.\n\nMy brothers had their own rooms, stereos, got to choose their own clothes. They had a sit down supper every night. They were able to be in school activities, hang out with friends and had their first cars bought for them.  I remember mom rubbing my little brother's feet every night before bed.  They could have friends over. Mom didn't have to work anymore so she was a sahm. She went to all school activities and attended every after school function.\n\nNone of those happened for me. Clothes were hand me downs or salvation army. We wore what fit, not what we liked. No school activities as every club had fees. We 4 kids shared a room and mom slept on the couch.  Mom never went to a teachers conference or went to any in school things.  No talking to mom about anything. She'd tell me she had problems of her own. She was overworked, overwhelmed, and stuck in a pit of despair. \n\nPoint is, even though we had the same mother, my younger brothers and myself were parented very differently.

Its not because i didnt want  them to have the world, i just didnt know how, didnt have the resources & was flying blind- i had never been a parent before. Im sure having a partner makes it a lot easier. Your almost 30, your siblings arent to blame for this. I really don't think anyone is. It's just a messed up situation that happened.

But neither is there anything wrong with you not wanting to participate in that plot line. \n\nI understand when you say that you don't resent the children, you don't resent them as individuals. But, it's hard to look at something that you never had, but desperately wanted, and see your siblings receiving that very thing. Regardless of the circumstances that led to that situation. You don't even have a difference in parentage. It isn't as if your mother and father never got together and your mother married someone else. These are literally both your biological parents, your biological siblings, yet there is such a disparity in situation that it can't help but breed hurt. \n\nI venture to say that what you are calling \"resentment\" is in fact an emotional bruising, a deep, soul felt hurt, and perhaps a bit of confusion, \"why couldn't he have come back when I was still a child?\" And all of that is perfectly understandable. Couple it with the fact that you're bound to be at least 10 years older than your siblings. I am 10 years younger than my siblings, we have nothing in common and I'm 65. So if we can't manage to fully bridge that divide in age at our advanced years a 28-year-old and a 10 or 12 year-old have little chance of doing so. What I would advise is that you sit down and have a honest conversation with your parents, explain to them how hurt you are over this, explain to them how much it continues to hurt you. Do you need therapy? Maybe yes maybe no. It benefits everyone to have somebody to talk to who isn't judgemental, but it's not necessarily the first step. The first step is being honest with your parents, with what they can expect from you, with what you expect from them, and drawing some boundaries.

It seems pretty heavy.", "NAH\n\nOne thing I have come to understand now that I am on the other side of this is that you have to shift your expectations. No two kids get the same parents, even if you are siblings. Your parents were in a different space and place mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, spiritually and in their maturity. \n\nThey both needed space to develop, and through no fault of your own, they did it apart. Your childhood could've been worse had they tried staying together.

But you are looking through a clouded lens. They are trying and it shows. Give them grace. You will need it when you go through this with your kids.

But if that really is too much, maybe suggesting a trip with just the two of them. But I\u2019m glad that OP felt comfortable enough and has the confidence to tell her mother her honest feelings. Ultimately though Op doesn\u2019t have to go on any trip or to any event she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with, but since her mother has always been there it\u2019s only fair to at least put in the consideration, even if ends up not being the best choice for OP in the end she shouldn\u2019t go on the trip. It\u2019s fine if the trip doesn\u2019t happen, Op needs are obviously important, all I\u2019m say is it\u2019s be fair to at least consider it for her moms sake. Only OP knows how much she can handle and if it would be too much to handle. Hopefully OP\u2019s mother is understanding, and if the trip with everyone is too much, will consider a trip with just the two of them. \n\n\nAs I said before, she doesn\u2019t owe her siblings or, especially, her father anything, but she might owe it to herself to, maybe not now and only when she\u2019s ready and if her father proves himself, to rebuild her relationship with her father. He absolutely sucks. And doesn\u2019t deserve it. Having a relationship with your father can be so meaningful in life though, and if there\u2019s a chance at a healthy relationship, it could be worth it for her to at least be open to it, granted her father actually puts in the work and does a hell of a lot better than he did in the past. Only for her own sake, if the relationship enriches her life. It might not. It sounds like the heart of the issue is from his abandonment for most of her life. She deserved better. Maybe writing him letters about the pain he caused her and the resentment against her siblings as a result of his actions would be helpful to get some closure. Right now his actions have caused a lifetime of pain, denied OP time with her mother and strained OP\u2019s relationship with her, and justly caused resentment against OP\u2019s siblings. His actions and everything it\u2019s caused should be addressed to him, and even if it\u2019s just the release of telling him and him knowing from her the consequences of his actions can give her some release or closure, or start a dialogue to at least get to a better place with boundaries in the future. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe her siblings anything, and maybe it\u2019s too hard rn, and will take working through what her father did to her before she can be ready to have a relationship with them. Sibling relationships can be incredibly rewarding as well, and although she doesn\u2019t owe it to them, she might owe it to herself to take advantage of the opportunity of having siblings. The siblings haven\u2019t done anything, and it isn\u2019t their fault her dad just got it together with them. It also isn\u2019t her fault that her dad created this mess and left OP with justifiable resentment and pain. Only when she\u2019s ready it could be worth it to get to know them, siblings can add such joy to your life. \n\nI agree that maybe this trip isn\u2019t the best idea, and that OP shouldn\u2019t do things she\u2019s not comfortable with or ready for, OP\u2019s mental health is super important! But the idea of of simply avoiding situations that have OP face these feelings all together isn\u2019t helpful either, or realistic long term as I\u2019m guessing since OP was close with her mother, that situations like this will routinely occur in the future. Avoiding the pain of what her father did will ultimately only prolong the pain and/or make things more painful down the road. Her comfort and mental health are important, and long term avoiding it won\u2019t help that. \n\nNA for not wanting to go on this trip.

It's taken years, but I've let go of much of the anger and sadness I felt. We're all adults now, the youngest turns 21 in just a few months. My siblings are pretty cool.

It's difficult to have a relationship with anyone (mother, friend, coworker) when there's that dynamic going on with that  person's kids. The siblings are going to notice more and more, and likely strongly resent OP back.  \n\nThe parents will increasingly put in situations where they have to choose between their kids, and they will likely choose the ones that are minors.  It's not \"fair\" but sometimes people have to make a choice.\n\nIt sounds like this is the first time OP has brought this up to her mom, so hopefully the parents can now work on recognizing the ways OP has been hurt.  Mom and Dad are wrong for not realizing this before now.  This should be the start of a long process of communication and healing, but OP doesn't sound open to that in her comments.\n\nThe problem is that OP is committed to her current strategy of having no relationship with the siblings.  That's her choice, but I think it's quite likely to end up hurting her the most.  It's also not \"fair\" but human relationships are messy.", "So what can your parents do now, besides find a time machine somewhere, to fix this, or at least fix this to a point where you CAN be part of the family? I am not being snarky here, and my judgment is NTA, so this is a serious question. You don't want to do the family Disney thing with the little kids, understandable, but what do you want that your parents can provide? Do you really want to go on a trip, just you and them, and have your moment as the cherished child of TWO parents who gets to do something wonderful, like your siblings get to do now? And if that's the thing that would help, would your parents do that for you? Is there a grandparent or aunt or uncle who could watch the kids for a week while you and your parents to to somewhere that's not Disney? \n\nYou can't turn back time, but sometimes you can find something that makes up for part of what was lost. You mentioned that you might go on a trip with just your mother or both your parents without your siblings. If your parents can find a sitter for your siblings, AND if they'd be willing to do that, could you make the choice to let the trip salve enough of the wound that you could then move forward as part of your parents' family? If so, then it's worth a conversation. If something like that would enable you to move forward with your siblings then it would be well worth the time and expense. And your parents might enjoy the trip with just you.\n\nAnd before anyone says that (1) that's childish - no, it isn't. Sometimes you have to get creative about fixing an old hurt before you can move forward; and (2), that's too expensive a solution, no, it isn't. When something is important and can be solved with time and some money, you find the time and money. And if you can't find the time and money - even borrowed money, or Disney trip money and postpone the Disney trip - then it wasn't that important.", "Exactly, NAH. Everyone is just doing the best that they can given the situation and sometimes life is dookie. I cannot imagine how hard it would be to swallow this situation. I can't call these feelings healthy.

Parents spend time doing stuff with younger kids? They should make time to spend with OP individually. \n\nParenthood isn\u2019t suppose to be easy. Doesn\u2019t mean you get to hurt your kid to make yourself feel better. It isn\u2019t fair to chose between kids. You give all of them equal amounts of love, time, money.

They literally can't stand to be around the kids because it's too difficult to see the happy life they couldn't have now that the parents are in a better place. \n\nIt's not about the vacation or spending more time with the kids but clearly op is struggling with some heavy stuff and that's why the therapy is a good idea.\n\nEta: weird to be downvoted when op agrees therapy is helpful for them and is in it.", "They're strangers only because OP, in her jealously,  decided that she wanted nothing to do with her siblings.", "I seriously doubt it", "I\u2019m having a vague sense here, of this particular debate being a matter of perspective\u2026 not sure how well I\u2019ll be able to put it, but I think it\u2019s possible for OP to be both doing the best she can in a hard situation, and *also*, in her way of coping with her own feelings, cause emotional pain to others? \n\nBear with me\u2026 Bc OPs feelings are 10,000% ok and understandable and valid. So she\u2019s angry. Which is fair, and normal. But she also recognizes, logically, that it\u2019s not younger sibs \u2018fault\u2019, but her feelings remain. So the best she can do (or knows how to do at this moment), is to keep her distance, in a way to protect both her innocent but still representative-of-everything-that-she-never-got-to-have younger siblings. Right? And it\u2019s probably maybe even a bit of protection for herself, too\u2026 of the validity of her feelings and preserving her right to have them, without being talked out of them or reasoned out of them, maybe because feeling angry is safer than feeling hurt? Or something like that? \n\nSo she keeps her mouth shut and stays safely away, which is absolutely her right, as an individual processing huge feelings in a situation that can\u2019t practically be changed, right? \n\nBut that coping strategy, that protection of ego (ego in the sense of self, not arrogance!!) doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum? However valid her feelings are, the actions that those feelings are making necessary do have an impact on the entire family. Is that her responsibility? Not necessarily\u2026 But. Does acting like her feelings aren\u2019t manifesting in actions that have actual, real life *impact* on other people\u2014 who also deserve *their* valid feelings just as much as OP does hers\u2014 doing anything to prevent that impact? No. \n\nSeems like it\u2019s boiling down to a matter of perspective around obligation, or responsibility, or just, like, connection? Bc what OP is really staring down is the need to have and honor her own feelings, and balancing that with her desire to remain part of her family, and to also care for the people in that family (ie her mom, specifically) without abandoning her own feelings\u2026 if that makes sense? \n\nIt sounds like OP simply isn\u2019t ready, or confident enough in her own inner emotional landscape, to take on all the inevitable noise of other people\u2019s clamoring emotional needs/feelings\u2026? And that\u2019s ok, too!! You can\u2019t force things like this, and if you try before you\u2019re really ready, it can cause more harm, which circles back to reinforce the negative feelings that already existed. \n\nBut I think the big thing here, is for OP to *be aware* of what\u2019s happening inside her, of her own coping mechanisms, and the fear/hurt underlying the anger\u2026 Bc the logic of knowing that her mom and siblings didn\u2019t do anything \u2018wrong\u2019, doesn\u2019t change the fact that her feelings exist, and are *also* valid\u2026? \n\nClearly OP is dealing\u2014 even as an adult, and *especially* as she prepares for a new chapter of marriage, and possibly her own family?\u2014 in a new way with facing the truth that she did not get something she needed, and that is HARD. \n\nBut now she\u2019s needing to do the next thing, and not live frozen in the fragile safety of it being safer to keep away and not confront the things that trigger her grief\u2026 Bc her family IS innocent in this also, and nothing can ever be repaired if it\u2019s not brought out in to the open. And at some point the window for OP to remain as connected with her mom as she has been and clearly wants to remain, or to establish a bond with her siblings, and even to ultimately GET that sense of belonging she\u2019s so sad not to have had, and \u201cthe fully family experience\u201d (bc it\u2019s not too late for OP to still have, even if it looks different than younger-her imagined!!?) will require her to take a risk. And talk. Let her mom in. Let her dad in too, when she\u2019s ready. To open her heart to the family that is *not* rejecting her, even though it may feel as though, by not staying suspended in time just mom + OP, they did\u2026? \n\nIdk, too long a comment already, I just hope OP can find a way through her feelings, to honor them while not allowing those feelings to punish herself most of all (but also her family).", "YTA, but only mildly. It's fine that you don't want to go, that's perfectly reasonable. But it sounds like your parents do still love you, so I feel like you need to have a heart to heart with your parents instead of snapping at them about your frustrations. Your feelings are valid (not everyone can be a saint and let go of the past), but unless you talk to them about everything your feeling I feel like your feelings will only get more bitter and eventually reach a boiling point.", "YTA\nGrow up. I have a similar family dynamic to you. My father did his best, but he was more like an older brother to me than a father. My little brothers, who are about 20 years younger than me, get to experience the the real dad side of him. Watching my little brothers grow up and turn into little men has been so rewarding for me, and the older they get the more I love them. You were given a gift, which is more family. Your siblings have nothing to do with the sins of your parents. Open your heart to them, and you will be happy you did.", ">\t, it\u2019s like people on this sub think you should get therapy if you cut yourself clipping your toenails.\n\nHave you cut yourself, whilst cutting your toenails?\n\nOh my, that must have been dreadful. How are you feeling? PTSD? Have you thought of therapy?\n\n\n<< Evil Grin >>", "You should tell your dad because he\u2019s the one to blame in all of this. Your mom did the best she could whilst your deadbeat father abandoned you both. He should have provided for you.", "Upvoted for the best advice on this thread, so far.", "Her dad never left he was in the army which he doesn't really get to say where he is deployed. We don't really know the in and outs why the split. But you cant really blame someone who job it is, is to be deployed over seas.", "Op is not there yet. She is still processing the hurt. She needs to have an honest conversation with both her parents. Opening that dialogue is the first step in healing. Forcing a relationship with her siblings prematurely will probably result badly for all parties involved.", "NTA although I think you didn\u2019t make your mom cry, I think it\u2019s more her coming to the realization a hood of hers won\u2019t come it pass. Hopefully this can lead to a better relationship between the two of you", "NTA - I get it but it's a pretty unhealthy way to live for you and your parents.\n\n\n>\nTo everybody parroting 'therapy' like a broken record. I get it and go to it. I swear, it's like people on this sub think you should get therapy if you cut yourself clipping your toenails.\n\n100% this subbreddit, lucky you didn't get incorrectly accused of gaslighting as that is the second mot popluar thing to do here.", "NTA for avoiding a hellish Disney vacation \u2026.., I can\u2019t blame you for that. I do think you should express your anger to your dad and not direct it at the kids. Can I blame you for feeling more like an aunt then a sister with that big of age difference? No. Still you can get to know your siblings (maybe without your dad there at first. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)", "NTA and i just want to say i LOVE your EDIT. \"seek therapy\" should be posted right next to \"Don't Downvote Assholes!\" so that we dont all need to read it a billion times. wish you the best with your happy marriage and future \u2661", "NTA, but maybe your mom ought to be part of your therapy as well as it *seems* she might be carrying some guilt over not being able to provide the childhood you couldn't have. You should talk that over with your therapist", "INFO: did your dad make enough effort to get to know you, spend time with you, you know, be a dad, after he came back?\n\nSending you all my love.", "NTA\n\nIt's natural to feel hurt in this situation, and it's great that you've been able to be open with your mom about how you're feeling. \n\nIt's natural for her to be upset.\n\nI personally don't get why people react like anyone should have to run around apologising for someone crying because you were honest about your feelings. You get to feel how you feel and your not responsible for other peoples happiness.\n\nIt sounds like your mom has possibly been harbouring some 'happy families' notions since you were young; there has to be a reason she's pushing it against your wishes.\n\nI wonder if she realises that making the family vacation centred around the kids desire to go to disney is compounding the issue? You're not obligated to have any relationship you don't want to, but if you did want to work towards a better relationship perhaps you could suggest an alternative that would be enjoyable for all involved - a beach holiday so the kids can enjoy playing, you & your fiancee go, you have separate accommodation so you have your own space when you need it but can spend several days together, or a few hours each day, or whatever feels manageable.", "NTA\n\nI have this guilt as a parent, my youngest getting things his older half-siblings didn't/don't get due to their dad passing away (even if it's beyond my control doesn't mean it guilt/resentment other hard feelings can't form)\n\nI think your feelings are valid & your mum needs to respect them but I can see her POV of wanting her family to get along as well.", "NTA - your parents aren\u2019t either but they need to understand how hard it is for you to see your siblings have the life that you wanted. It\u2019s can\u2019t be easy. There is also another factor they need to take into consideration, the 18+ age gap between you and your siblings, it\u2019s not helping to get close.", "Morally NAH, But... You comments are so bitter and out of reality. You are ready to loose the relationship you have with your mom (and dad - and yeah, if you don't want to see their kids your relationship with suffer) just out of bitterness. That's really sad, and that is not going to end well if you're having kids.\n\nIt's easy to say \"I won't do like my parents\", but you don't know what life will be. Maybe you will divorce and your kid will blame you for not staying married, because one of his parents will remarry and he will see half siblings having what he didn't have. Maybe one of you will get sick, or loose your jbo, and you won't be able to give your kids what they want, and they will resent you. Or maybe being obsessed with keeping your child in a one home unit will make everybody miserable because you and his father will fall out of love. Or maybe you will all live happily ever after.\n\nThe point is : you don't know. It's easy to judge, it's easy to blame, but you don't always control your life. Running from your parents because they can offer more to their youngest kids is not going to give you anything back and will probably do more harm than good in the long run.", "You are allowed to be upset that your siblings get to have stuff you didn't get, but punishing your dad and siblings for the decisions your parents made when they were teenagers is mean. \n\nAnd yes you should be in therapy about this cos you are cutting your siblings out of your life cos you are jealous. \n\nDon't ask for advice if you don't want it.", "I think your anger makes no sense. No one did anything wrong to you. Your mother raised you as best she could. Your dad was abroad. Your siblings were just born. Why are you mad at them? \nBeing jealous of your young siblings and mad at mommy and daddy because you're no longer an only child, at 28 years old, is not a good look. Maybe you're not an asshole but you definitely sound like a self-centred spoiled brat", "Those kids aren\u2019t \u201cliving the childhood you should have had\u201d. They are living the childhood life has dealt them - and apparently that includes a resentful older sister. \n\nYou can make whatever choices you want to about the sort of family relationships you want but life will be better for you if you grow up and accept reality. Whose to say things would have worked out between your parents when they were younger? Whose to say you would have had the same close relationship with your mother if you were sharing her love and time with her partner and other children?", "Yeah, a bit. Build a bridge and get over it. Don't fall into the river!", "YTA your childhood sucked but that couldn\u2019t be helped. resenting children is just sad. \nbare this in mind your siblings will remember this and probably won\u2019t have nothing to do with you in future.", "Your jealous of the childhood your siblings are getting that you missed out on. That is understandable. \n\nBut now you are denying yourself a relationship with your family. You are letting your past hurts make new ones for you. \n\nDon't let what you missed out on in the past make you miss out in the present. \n\nEasier said than done, I know, but nothing worthwhile is ever easy. \n\nYou love your family, but it hurts to see them so happy and think back on what you went through.

And maybe she will keep victimizing herself and blame everyone around instead of working on herself.", "Op and her mom probably bonded over being without her dad. She was left just as much as her mom was left. Now daddy is back, mom is with him again and she is the one that got replaced by him AND her mom. It probably feels like OPs mom has undone all that bonding, whereas she was over her dad a long time ago.", "Except that she stated he left.", "Never said dad left they broke up. And didn't give any other reason than that there could be a million reason for the break up.", "And they can but it also shows the state of their mental health lol.
