I apologize for the long post. When I met him, he was suffering from a back injury. Around two weeks after we met, the back injury became worse, and he went on unemployment. For roughly six months I drove to see him since he was unable to drive. I was fortunate to have a job with a flexible schedule that allowed me to make my own hours. His doctors told him he would need intensive physical therapy. Since one of the best therapists in our area is about five minutes from my house that I own. I offered my spare room, charged him rent, and drove him to his therapy appointments three times a week for the next six months. \n\nHe was able to return to work, but held jobs for short periods of time before his back would flare up or he would find out the job wasn\u2019t for him. I continued to support the household as the partner making more. While I continued to charge him rent, I paid for food, trips, car expenses, and often his phone bill. Since I had helped him with his resume early on, I knew that he had a strong work history before the back injury. I wanted him to be able to get back on his feet. He has missed rent twice before this incident. \n\nThis summer we planned a trip to the beach with his family. I had visited this beach many times as a child. I offered to pay for the vacation when he said he couldn\u2019t afford it (I very much wanted to go and would have got a hotel if I went solo), but he paid part of the deposit. We went. To put it in context, I spent roughly 2500 on the vacation and he spent 1200. We drove the ten hours using my car. He expressed concerns about not being able to afford it leading up to the trip. I continued to offer to pay. He continued to turn it down. \n\nUpon returning from the trip, he failed to pay rent and let me know two weeks after it was due. He demanded an apology from me for not respecting his no which caused the financial strain and the argument became heated. He then demanded that we ignore each other for two weeks (I have a tendency to try to talk things out and he wants space). I said i would like him to stay somewhere else for that time. I said I couldn\u2019t force him to leave, but I can\u2019t leave since I have pets and other tenants (I have stayed at my moms for a day or two in the past) He explained that he wouldn\u2019t leave no matter what without police and can\u2019t pay rent for the next few months. \n\nI sent him a notice to quit and offered to reimburse the 1200. So, am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: I am trying hard to answer all the questions! Thank you everyone for your judgments so far. Just to add some info. I make 400 a week. He makes about 500. He does not want to share a room and has stayed in the spare room since he moved in\n\nEDIT2: I am answering as many as I can that contain questions. Thank you all so much for helping me and sharing your stories.", "created_utc": 1690684628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15da1cj/aita_for_giving_my_husband_a_notice_to_quit/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because he said he won\u2019t leave without the police it\u2019s like he asked for it and so you gave him the legal intervention in a different way.\n\nThis relationship doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s working so maybe him moving out is for the best unless you don\u2019t have a prenup\u2026 have you consulted a lawyer to safeguard yourself?", "ESH. He's either your tenant or your husband.  You both may need a third party to help you two figure which one it is", "YTA. It sounds like you have all the financial power in your relationship. Why are you charging your husband rent?", "In spite of what everyone else is saying. Charging him rent is actually a really good idea, if this ends in divorce - it gives you some evidence that he doesn\u2019t \u201cown\u201d even partially the house, so long as you have a written agreement that he is leasing/renting space from you.\n\nAs for the situation, I\u2019m gonna say NTA. If he wants space then he has to be the one to create that space, also if you offered to cover some costs for the holiday and he turned it down, that\u2019s really a him problem. He needs to learn when to put his ego/pride aside and accept the help!\n\nOverall looking at your other comments, it doesn\u2019t sound like this is an overly healthy relationship especially since he refuses to go back to therapy. You sound like a very caring partner who was willing to put everything on the line for some you\u2019d just met, you deserve the same.", "YTA. Forget about whole vacation thing.  This is not how you behave when you are married. Charge your husband rent?  Really?", "NTA but how about divorce papers. (I don\u2019t know what Notice to Quit means? Eviction?) keep the $1200 towards his nonexistent rent.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure when you got married to him but I\u2019d consider a divorce. It sounds like you are over him not pulling his weight and have been more than generous with bill paying and such since meeting him. If he didn\u2019t have the money for the trip then he should have kept his ass home. Sounds like he is a big mooch and not much of a husband. Why would he keep the room and not move in completely with you and let you make that money off of someone else. Things are strangely set up in your house but I can\u2019t say your wrong.", "YTA you married a man with a back injury, you knew presumably before you got married that he couldn't hold a job, you continued with the relationship then you now score-keep, resent him for not paying you rent (you're married why is he your tennant) and now you want to kick him out, do you love him at all?", "I\u2019m not sure what a notice to quit is but you\u2019re NTA. This man is a rock weighing you down in the water. You guys are not compatible and he is leeching off you.  You have some hard thinking ahead of you.", "ESH. Because kicking him out is unreasonable.

You have been married for 3 years and he pays you rent to live in a different room in your house to you and now you want to evict him cos you forced him into a financial situation cos you wanted a holiday? \n\nSo very confused. \n\nShouldn't you share a room and share the costs of a mortgage and a home as husband and wife? \n\nYou wanted a holiday, he couldn't afford it, and you essentially forced him to participate anyway... \n\nYou seem to spend a lot of time comparing expenses, that's not a healthy way to manage a marriage.

If you waited a while, you would have noticed that he can't hold a job.  Then you probably wouldn't have married him.\n\nBut you DID marry him.  And then assigned him to live in a spare room.  And oh yeah, he has to pay rent to live in the spare room.\n\nSo your marriage is ironic in the extreme.  Most marriages devolve to the point where the couple realize (someday) they are just roommates.  But you married a guy who from the start wasn't even a roommate.  Now I understand there are many marriages where the couple sleeps in separate beds, and somehow manage to make it work.  But from the start, he was banished to his own room?  OK, so what was the whole marriage thing about?  \n\n\"Baby...I love you so much I want to marry you and then banish you to another part of the building and never see you unless I stop by to collect the rent...\"\n\nOK, we're engaged!!!\n\nWait, WHAT?!?!?!?", "I applaud you for acknowledgment. \n\nHe isn't just a roommate, or your child.

He may need to be reminded of that.\n\nI have had a terrible injury, I used to be a barber, and I sliced my dominate hand and was out of work for 6 months, and the month I came back, covid happened and took me out of a job for another 3 months. I felt terrible about myself. Not working for 9 months? I felt horrible. I didin't have anyone to help me through it.

What parts of your lives are connected and what do you share? Or does he just live in your spare room? \n\nYou might need to both divorce him and evict him\u2026", "You sound like roommates more than anything", "This is reddit, everything is leave your spouse/SO/GF or GF.\n\nMy wife sneezed and didn't cover her nose...divorce her, shes toxic\n\nMy husband bought the wrong cat litter...what a controlling insecure evil man he is...divorce him.\n\nThats about par for the course.", "Unfortunately, I\u2019d end up writing an essay if I tried to cover our whole relationship. Because we did not buy the house together and I did before we were married and his residence in the spare room, I wasn\u2019t sure what else to call his contribution but rent. We have been to counseling", "He makes roughly 500 a week. His jobs have been very inconsistent. He has at times made more at times less", "This is true. Perhaps board would have been the better term. He uses my car often and does not buy his own food", "Depends on where you live", ">Until death or missed rent payment do us part?\n\nThis summarizes my problem with the idea of charging your married partner rent. I get charging a girlfriend or boyfriend, a fiance... and I get the concept that people think a legal agreement can protect your ownership of the home (note: I said \"people think\" rather that \"it does\" because how property is allowed to be considered in marriage is dependent entirely on the jurisdiction, and if anyone is concerned about their ownership in a marriage they need to have a pre-nup, not a rental contract)... but a girlfriend or boyfriend can be broken up and evicted, you're not going to throw away a marriage over rent. A marriage is \"I want to spend the rest of my life with you regardless of if there are circumstances that make it difficult, I'll support you through it.\" Yes, marriages don't always survive in practice, but charging your partner rent goes against the entire point of marriage. And it's okay if a partner *never* being able to contribute is a deal breaker for you, but you address that with a admitting the marriage is over and the vows are over with a divorce? Not by saying \"this one missed rent payment means I'm going to evict you.\"", "Yeah it is a rather unusual set up, but ultimately a married couple with separate finances do contribute to the monthly bills.  \n\nThe calling it and treating it as rent is definitely problematic.", ">I agree that vacation is a problem which started the issue at hand. But I find the entire set up of rent for the husband more problematic. \n\nBINGO!  Love your comment of until death or missed rent payment do us part...", "I offered to pay for the appeal. We were both devastated by the denial", "which is the hard thinking they should have done before applying for a marriage license, obviously...", "I want a supportive partner. I felt that I had offered him support in the past up until this point. I might be looking at it unclearly, so I do apologize if I am. I would love to get into real estate and be in business with him. I do want to continue, but I am scared of tying myself more concretely to him if this is a bigger problem than just my frustration", "Just to answer your question, he wanted to stay in the spare room. I wanted to room together", "Thank you so much and I am so sorry for the injury you experienced. I am very worried about having been too harsh", "That is a very good point. Thank you for pointing it out. I can use it to examine my greater feelings toward him. Your insight is very appreciated.", "I sent him a long text about the situation. A text would not hold up in a court of law. I did not file anything. I do not want to take such an irreversible step if I am not seeing clearly", "Thank you for asking. He does offer emotional support when needed. I have covered so much of the expenses for so long because he has so many good qualities. I know I\u2019d want the help if I was injured.", "He should *easily* be able to swing $400/month considering you pay all the other bills.", "OP why don\u2019t you and your husband stay in the same room? That does not make much sense. It sounds like you love mostly separate lives even though you say you are married.", "And how much do you make?", "but that would again mean that he's entirely dependent on you and your whims hence you giving him notice because you don't believe you're equal partners and you aren't, you control everything regarding finances and then demand he gets out of your house", "Ok, but that still makes me wonder why you two got married at all.  It does not matter who suggested such an odd arrangement.  It hardly screams, \"Let's Get Married!!!\"", "Thank you but I overcame it, and your husband will overcome his. You can't change what you have said or done, but you can change what you say and do.\n\nHow do you want your husband to remember you when you handled his back injury? Because he will eventually only see this as a memory, he will overcome it.\n\nBe the person you want to be in that memory. Because it will someday be your memory too.", "That is true. We do live very separate lives. I have asked him about it several times. I do want to stay in the same place and budget/join finances. He has refused", "Unfortunately, I am in a low paid profession as an aid. I make about 400 a week.", "He did not have the money for the appeal (this was during the unemployment period). I didn\u2019t want him to not have another stab at it, so I offered to pay. He said he wasn\u2019t interested in appealing", "He suggested it. His insurance was lapsing. I have very good insurance", "I have a serious back injury also. I haven\u2019t worked in over 5yrs. I also suffer from mental illness. But with my back I have degenerative disc and arthritis wrapped around those disc in my lower back. My husband has asked me to take care of myself before I try and go back to work. I may never go back and he is okay with that. I do what a stay at home partner should do (within my limitations). Asking anyone to give more then they are capable of is wrong. Try some understanding and patience. You would want the same understanding and patience if the tables where turned.", "Are you actually legally married? Sorry to keep asking questions, but I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around this situation to make a verdict. Do you still rent out rooms to your house besides the room you rent to your husband? I guess I\u2019m trying to understand better your marriage. The way you describe things sounds platonic and a landlord/tenant relationship, not a marriage.", "It sounds like you two have a very strange marriage.", "Did he want a green card?! You viewing your marriage in such a transactional and passive aggressive manner is so off.", "So yes, YTA for evicting your husband. lol, but reading your other responses I don't think this a question of whether or not you're the asshole. This is a question of whether or not you guys are on the same page financially.\n\nYou guys are married but your finances are separate. Do you have a savings account? If you can afford to drop 3700 dollars on a vacation it sounds like you're in a better financial spot than him, whether that's through money you had before him or you being better with saving than he is.\n\nYou guys need to have a joint account that your joint expenses like food/bills etc. come out of and decide equitably how much each of you contributes to it. Do you guys have debts? Do you guys have personal debts that both of you know about?\n\nIf he says he can't afford the trip he can't afford it, and in his defense, dropping 1200 dollars on something without a decent notice when you make 2000 a month usually can be a financial strain. And if you wanted to pay for it, why not just, let him skirt on the rent for 3 months to make up the 1200? Also he might feel like you're always the one taking care of things and that could make him feel like less of a person or that he's not doing his part, which would explain why he was adamant on paying the 1200 and why he doesn't want his name on your house. \n\nIt's also weird that if he averages around 500 a week yet he can't make 400 a month. You would think he's saving money. There's something else going on with his money that you aren't aware of \n\nI think you guys need to have a serious talk about money, what your financial goals are and how you guys are going to achieve them together, and maybe see a couples counselor. You also need to be more transparent about your personal financial situations.", "Omg girl. Are you blind?\n\nCan you not see he is totally taking you for a ride?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to share a room with you. \n\nHe wanted to get married so he could benefit from your health insurance. \n\nHe lives in a house where he pays only 400 dollars and not a penny more. Wifey pays for his groceries, phone bill, everything. \n\nHave some self respect for crying out loud. Bin this loser. Evict him, divorce him and go and find yourself a real husband. \n\nOne that actually loves you and not your bank balance. One that you can share a bed with and who wants to split everything equally.", "We are legally married. After we got married, I said I would like him to move in with me (my room) and take the half ownership of the house so we could rent out his old room. I have about five bedrooms in my house. He refused. The other bedrooms are rented to friends.", "I do think you are right about a serious discussion needing to be had. I\u2019ve offered the things you speak of before. He is adamant about living separate lives. He has not offered an explanation, I am not sure if there\u2019s something he doesn\u2019t want me to know or if it is something else. I do know his credit is very low", "It sounds to me like he's hiding debt from you if his score is low."]}
