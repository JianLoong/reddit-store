I apologize for the long post. When I met him, he was suffering from a back injury. Around two weeks after we met, the back injury became worse, and he went on unemployment. For roughly six months I drove to see him since he was unable to drive. I was fortunate to have a job with a flexible schedule that allowed me to make my own hours. His doctors told him he would need intensive physical therapy. Since one of the best therapists in our area is about five minutes from my house that I own. I offered my spare room, charged him rent, and drove him to his therapy appointments three times a week for the next six months. \n\nHe was able to return to work, but held jobs for short periods of time before his back would flare up or he would find out the job wasn\u2019t for him. I continued to support the household as the partner making more. While I continued to charge him rent, I paid for food, trips, car expenses, and often his phone bill. Since I had helped him with his resume early on, I knew that he had a strong work history before the back injury. I wanted him to be able to get back on his feet. He has missed rent twice before this incident. \n\nThis summer we planned a trip to the beach with his family. I had visited this beach many times as a child. I offered to pay for the vacation when he said he couldn\u2019t afford it (I very much wanted to go and would have got a hotel if I went solo), but he paid part of the deposit. We went. To put it in context, I spent roughly 2500 on the vacation and he spent 1200. We drove the ten hours using my car. He expressed concerns about not being able to afford it leading up to the trip. I continued to offer to pay. He continued to turn it down. \n\nUpon returning from the trip, he failed to pay rent and let me know two weeks after it was due. He demanded an apology from me for not respecting his no which caused the financial strain and the argument became heated. He then demanded that we ignore each other for two weeks (I have a tendency to try to talk things out and he wants space). I said i would like him to stay somewhere else for that time. I said I couldn\u2019t force him to leave, but I can\u2019t leave since I have pets and other tenants (I have stayed at my moms for a day or two in the past) He explained that he wouldn\u2019t leave no matter what without police and can\u2019t pay rent for the next few months. \n\nI sent him a notice to quit and offered to reimburse the 1200. So, am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: I am trying hard to answer all the questions! Thank you everyone for your judgments so far. Just to add some info. I make 400 a week. He makes about 500. He does not want to share a room and has stayed in the spare room since he moved in\n\nEDIT2: I am answering as many as I can that contain questions. Thank you all so much for helping me and sharing your stories.\n\nEDIT3: Thank you all! My responses might slow down because I am very tired, but you all gave me such incredible insight and perspective. I can\u2019t stay thank you enough. I can always do better and no matter how this turns out I\u2019ll remember all the kind words and straightforward YTAs (the fact that you took the time to respond is kind no matter what the content was).\n\nFinal edit: I will keep answering questions but just to put a few things up here. I am not AI. I am ND. I didn\u2019t put it in the previous post but I grew up very poor. I worked in warehouses (third shift) for ten years to afford my house. I couldn\u2019t get a day job in my field because my parents became very sick after i graduated. I went to college on scholarship and worked several jobs. I know I have a hair trigger around money which is why I asked if I\u2019d been too harsh or emotional in my reaction. This has been a point of contention and you\u2019re welcome to not believe me! I do love him. I didn\u2019t want to be emotional in my post and being ND makes it hard to express them.", "created_utc": 1690684628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15da1cj/aita_for_giving_my_husband_a_notice_to_quit/", "score": 454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he wants space then he has to be the one to create that space, also if you offered to cover some costs for the holiday and he turned it down, that\u2019s really a him problem. He needs to learn when to put his ego/pride aside and accept the help!\n\nOverall looking at your other comments, it doesn\u2019t sound like this is an overly healthy relationship especially since he refuses to go back to therapy. You sound like a very caring partner who was willing to put everything on the line for some you\u2019d just met, you deserve the same.", "YTA. Forget about whole vacation thing.

But the process to do that starts with divorce and then the next step is eviction, not eviction first.", "OK, so your first mistake was in getting married way too early, before you really knew your partner.  If you waited a while, you would have noticed that he can't hold a job.  Then you probably wouldn't have married him.\n\nBut you DID marry him.  And then assigned him to live in a spare room.  And oh yeah, he has to pay rent to live in the spare room.\n\nSo your marriage is ironic in the extreme.  Most marriages devolve to the point where the couple realize (someday) they are just roommates.  But you married a guy who from the start wasn't even a roommate.  Now I understand there are many marriages where the couple sleeps in separate beds, and somehow manage to make it work.  But from the start, he was banished to his own room?  OK, so what was the whole marriage thing about?  \n\n\"Baby...I love you so much I want to marry you and then banish you to another part of the building and never see you unless I stop by to collect the rent...\"\n\nOK, we're engaged!!!\n\nWait, WHAT?!?!?!?", "I applaud you for acknowledgment. \n\nHe isn't just a roommate, or your child. He is your husband, who has suffered an incredibly difficult injury. One that has been inflicting him for a long period of time, and you know he could hold jobs down before, and was accomplished.\n\nIsn't the classic saying in marriage \"Through sickness and health\"? This is the sickness. If he can't count on you when he is having a back injury, what if he was paralyzed?

A marriage is \"I want to spend the rest of my life with you regardless of if there are circumstances that make it difficult, I'll support you through it.\" Yes, marriages don't always survive in practice, but charging your partner rent goes against the entire point of marriage.

Like, you marry, you support each other whatever happens and didn't you know about his disability before you married? You know what you committed too right?

That solidifies me thinking he's taking advantage of you bc him willingly paying you nothing while simultaneously getting mad at you for having the audacity to pay is absurd. It keeps you trapped in that cycle of questioning yourself but still paying instead of leaving.\n\nI think you unintentionally called his bluff by telling him he can move out if he has an issue and that's why he flipped out. I think if he refuses to commit to therapy, refuses to participate in budgeting, and now is straight up refusing to contribute....there's nowhere else to go here. He isn't even appreciative of the fact that you've been subsidizing him, he resents you for it. That to me is the biggest sign that it's intentional on his part. I think if he really felt embarrassed by the fact that he was in a more destitute position, he would make more of an effort to prevent reliance on you from happening rather than just spite you for it.", "He is angry because he doesn't know himself.\nAnd no, there's no line to be drawn.

And the way that he relies on your financially doesn't sound good either. I'm also thinking the fact that he has his own room is really bizarre, unless he works from home or something out of that room. Your relationship doesn't look like a marriage to me.

They will only treat you the way you allow them to. \nAnd you started off as the caretaker or the compromiser, and he hasn't really compromised much (as far as what we know).

The man is clearly using you - moves into your spare room, refuses to share a room/bed with you, barely pays any money to you and only married you when he was about to lose your insurance. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you if you want to stay in this relationship, but I wouldn\u2019t. Does he tell you he loves you?", "YTA. You don\u2019t seem to like or respect him.", "Get divorced. What you describe isn't a marriage. He makes more $ than you, good, he doesn't need alimony and can move out. Or you can search for another place and just leave. He's going to ride rent free as long as he can. He doesn't like you, you don't like him. If he's vindictive, id worry how he's going to treat your pets when you're not around. Cut losses. Notarized 30 day notice. Have police escort him off the property if he tantrums.\nDoesn't sound like any love lost and building resentment.", "A Notice to Quit, to your husband??  You are planning on evicting your husband?  Are you two actually married?  This is such a bizarre situation, so I'm going with ESH.", "Can you even legally evict a spouse without some kind of reason like abuse or a separation agreement?\n\nAgreed with the HUHs here. Also unclear what you're getting out of this relationship other than rent sometimes.", "I'm confused here, because OP does say he isn't working, but also that brings in $500 a week, which is more than she does.", "Wouldn't that just be \"in-fo\"? (Putting in the hyphen so this doesn't count as a vote.)", "Agree. I got to the comments and went from HUH to ??HHHUH HUUUH HUHHH?? None of this makes any sense. Help me Understand Here.\n\nFor example, does OP\u2019s income ($400/week) include rent from her other tenants? Because if not, she could have a total income of 2x or more than the husband and not need the money. She offers to pay for stuff multiple times, then refuses to let his rent slide? Seems inconsistent. Is he racking up credit card debt trying to keep up appearances that he can afford her terms? Why doesn\u2019t OP believe him when he says he can\u2019t afford rent now? So much HUH.", "Super bizarre relationship but if you read a bunch of the other comments the story kind of comes together. \n\nHe moved in when they were \u201cdating\u201d and rented the room. He doesn\u2019t want to share a room with her and move into the master. They got married when his insurance was going to lapse, and they have not combined their lives in anyway. Frankly it sounds like she is being used by this guy for money and insurance.", "I'm married and don't sleep in the same room as my husband xD a lot of couples don't. The rent thing is kind of weird. Maybe just a wording thing.", "What does he spend the rest of his $$ on", "I don\u2019t agree with the commenter that you replied to here. They have misunderstood what is going on here.", "And they are married but werent living together until his back got worse. So did they were married before and then he moved into the spare room or they married WHILE he was unemployed? And are they married?! I get nothing from this post that this is a committed couple. Its so..... robotic? Im so lost O\\_O", "Are you sure you are even allowed to evict your spouse where you are from? Because I wasn't able to evict my ex until the divorce was final. I couldn't even start proceedings until I had the official decree, then I could have him served with a notice to quit.", "100%\n\nHe is definitely using her for the benefits.", "This is extremely uncommon for newlyweds. If you want to live separate lives why even get married? \n\nPlus OP says later on that they got married when his insurance was about to lapse. This guy is using her for coverage because he is injured and she pays his other bills.", "The more I see OP comment the more murky this whole post gets.... Let her pay our don't go out with her. But she says she's the higher earner but then says he makes 500 a week, her 400... Also she has other tenants? Like is that her income or is this some weird roommate commune thing??\n\nEither way, this never seemed like a marriage, just a rentorwb situation. I'm going with HUH?", "It sounds like he did keep putting his foot down and she just kept finding reasons not to accept it. He eventually came up with 1200 for the trip. He didn't even want to go on because he couldn't afford it, but then she gets mad at him for not paying rent on time despite having enough money to pay  the bills anyway.\n\nSo much of this doesn't make sense.", "Do you want to be married?", "Notice to Quit is a notice a landlord gives to a tenant, demanding they leave the property.

This loser married her for housing and insurance and keeps her at an arms length, being just kind enough to seem worth keeping. She's maybebfor a slef esteem issue. This is a sad situation", "Yta. This is the craziest \"marriage\" I've read about apart from those thruppkes etc. You don't seem married whatsoever and just have a roommate.", "YTA. Why are you making your husband pay rent in the first place? Also, his back problems are returning periodically and he can't control when they show up.

But looking at your comments and how you address him, yikes. I only have your side to go off of, but to summarize:\n\n- your jargon referring to your partner is more in line with a landlord referring to a delinquent Tennant\n- emphasis on the material and rent (?!?!), which isn't the most healthy thing to base an entire relationship on\n- the calculating tone you take underpins every response and the post\n\nI don't think you love him. I don't think you want to be with him. I think he's gone through a tough time and you drug him on a trip he didn't want to go on.\n\nI also think you're intentionally leaving a lot out, otherwise the judgment would be much quicker from others.", "INFO: one thing about the timeline is still unclear to me: how long did you date before you got married?", "YTA.

The notice was given when he said he couldn\u2019t contribute for the foreseeable future", "I\u2019m going go to try to go back through all the comments so I don\u2019t miss any questions.

In the beginning, I made slightly more than him. We agreed on 400 as his contribution to expenses. I was told to call it rent because he had the spare room rather than us sharing a room.

I was scared and upset when he said he wasn\u2019t sure when he\u2019d be able to contribute and needed to stop for at least a few months", "HUH more likely to make it than WTF, HUH's extreme relative", "Sorry! I am ND. I didn\u2019t mention it in the post but that is why my writing is so robotic. He moved into the spare room before we got married since it was closer to his therapist.
