She then goes to the kitchen and opens a bottle of \u00a3150 wine from Portugal (without asking) that me and my wife were saving for our anniversary and started drinking it with her friend.\n\nAbout half an hour later my MIL then asked me and my wife if we could go to our room so she can speak in private with her friend so my wife took me upstairs and apologised to me about her mum because she knows I hate unexpected guests. \nI then proceeded to smoke in the bedroom because I was stressed and annoyed, around 5 mins after she then starts shouting at me from the bottom of the stairs that I\u2019m disrespectful for smoking in MY house and that I\u2019m getting her and her friend \u201chigh\u201d.\nI looked at my wife and she stood. There just looking at her feet \nSo I went to the top of the stairs and told her she needs to be gone tomorrow when I get back from work because I refuse to be frustrated and uncomfortable in my own house.\n\nWhile I was at work I get a text from my wife saying I was disrespectful to her mum and that she and her mum will be at her aunts house until I\u2019m ready to apologise to both of them, and when she comes back she will be bringing my MIL with her. I\u2019ve told her I\u2019m not apologising and when and if she wants to come back she will be alone or she can\u2019t come back at all \n\nSo aita\n\nUPDATE: FIL has texted telling me thank you for having my MIL for the past 2 weeks, I told him what happened and he said my wife should have been on my side because he knows how my MIL can be and told my wife to come home and apologise l, he said I was more than likely not going to get an apology from either of them but to change the locks and not to accept my wife back until she apologises and he won\u2019t accept my MIL BACK until she apologised because it\u2019s only a matter of time until aunt gets sick of em because she already has a house full of people  lol ", "created_utc": 1704734405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191qcmw/aita_for_asking_my_mother_in_law_mil_to_leave_my/", "score": 484, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you're being disrespected and made to feel uncomfortable in your own home, your partner needs to be the one to do something about it.

That personal anecdote to say, while my experience wasn't like your wife's, I can appreciate the difficult work she has before her in navigating the control and harm her parents have done. She may not yet be willing to accept that she has been hurt and disrespected by her mother, it can be a difficult truth to accept. So all that to say her support is misplaced and her ultimatum that you accept being mistreated in your own home sucks, but try and view it with empathy for the difficult work ahead of her. \n\nAnd that's where I do think you carry a bit of blame.

You might've been able to handle it better. But you set clear boundaries and your mother didn't listen to any of them.

I would say that you should probably have communicated with your wife a bit more before doing this. But MIL **needs** to apologise before anything new can happen.", "Sounds like the MIL may have narcissistic personality disorder and have trained your wife since she was a baby to be her lapdog. \n\nThis would take more than an \"it's me or her\" ultimatum to fix.

She's been trained to be a yes woman, so without her mum present she'll likely flip immediately and apologise and say you were right but also not want to have conflict with her mum and want you to rug sweep. \n\nI think your wife is going to bed significant therapy to accept that her mum is toxic and likely always will be and that she can't be around her and be happy or stay married. It's a bitter pill. \n\nIt's probably seriously with considering moving a long way away from MIL if it'll save your marriage. Once your wife has opened her eyes to her mum's toxicity and built up boundaries / likely gone no contact you could maybe come back. But I'd expect that to be a years long process. \n\nAlso, could you go visit FIL? I'd be curious what sparked the separation and whether MIL told wife the truth. Maybe the MIL cheated or something and finding that out and sharing with your wife could put a crack in the hold MIL has on her. FIL might also be able to share other background on how MIL has used your wife. And right now is the time he's the most likely to talk openly.

Why didn\u2019t your wife have your back? You married her, not her mom.  Her mom has been over stepping but your wife does nothing?

Tell her you won\u2019t be apologizing again and that if she isn\u2019t back home ALONE by the end of the week you will start divorce proceedings.
