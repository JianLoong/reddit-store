We don\u2019t want a tantrum to erupt in the middle of the ceremony (happened at my sisters wedding)\n\nBut we\u2019ve decided to allow a few circumstances, my best friend  (who\u2019s also my maid of honours) daughter will be the flower girl as she is a very calm and quite 3 year old who sticks by her moms side \n\nAnd Brandon\u2019s sisters son (7M) to be the ring bearer, my husband and him are very close and he\u2019s a relatively calm kid who knows how to behave \n\nThe other exception we made was for my sister In law (my brothers wife) who gave birth to my niece three months ago, I\u2019m very very close with my sister in law and consider her a sister and it would devastate me if she couldn\u2019t attend (she can\u2019t leave the baby) so I\u2019ve made the exception after talking with my fianc\u00e9 and him agreeing it\u2019s best to have her there with the baby than not at all, she\u2019s also made it clear she would make sure the baby doesn\u2019t interfere with the wedding/ceremony \n\nAfter sending out invitations to guests that includes the information that we\u2019d be child free I\u2019d gotten nothing until a few days later when I\u2019d received an angry phone call from my cousin after finding out my brothers kid was allowed but not hers \n\nI think it\u2019s important to note my cousin has a 6 year old son who I\u2019ll call Jeffy he\u2019s the worst behaved child I\u2019ve ever met, my cousin and her husband are those people that believe their child can do no wrong and never tell him no he\u2019s constantly causing problems and taunting other children to the point he\u2019s been expelled from his kindergarten class \n\nHe\u2019s the toddler that ruined my sister ceremony which is the main reason we don\u2019t want him there, after explaining to her the reason my brother is allowed along with the two of children she told me I was \u201cpicking favourites\u201d and hung up \n\nLater that day I got an angry call from my aunt who thought I was being \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d\n\nI tried explaining to her that I\u2019d spent a lot of money on this wedding and I didn\u2019t want him to ruin it like he did my sisters she told me \u201cyou and *cousins name* were best friends as kids and it was horrible you\u2019d do this to her\u201d and ended the call \n\nA few days later I got a text informing me that she wouldn\u2019t be attending if she couldn\u2019t bring her son, I don\u2019t know what to do?\n\nSo AITA??\n\n\nEDIT: in my original post I left out a few details which was my bad, our wedding is child free for children under the age of 14 other then the three I\u2019d previously mentioned. like I said before the venue has a large lake next to it therefore I would never want to take the chance a child will wonder off and drown \n\nObviously the my three month old niece cannot walk so that\u2019s not a problem and the flower girl and ring barer are the only exceptions because 1.they can both swim (we made sure just as a precaution) 2. they\u2019ve also never been the type to wonder from their parents \n\nAnother reason is we\u2019ve invited around 135 guests therefore it\u2019s easy for a child to wonder from their parents,and not having a dozen children there will give me peace of mind and enjoy my wedding knowing there isn\u2019t a child in danger unknowingly \n\nI\u2019ve gotten a few questions asking how many children would not be allowed to attend and from the guests that we\u2019ve invited only 4 have children under the age of 14 as most of our friends are our age and don\u2019t have children yet, but those who\u2019s children aren\u2019t allowed to attend have all have been understanding of the rules for their children\u2019s safety (other than my cousin obviously) and me and my fianc\u00e9 both completely understand if people aren\u2019t able to attend because of that. I love my family/friends children and just don\u2019t want to see them in danger \n\n\nAnd for any guests that questioned why we made it 14+ we explained why including my cousin", "created_utc": 1690420405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15anrmw/aita_for_not_letting_my_cousin_bring_her_son_to/", "score": 420, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
