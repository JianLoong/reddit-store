She wanted to play this shitty game and got burned.", "Sheesh what AH\u2019s", "The cheating partner who left the country so he doesn't have to pay child support.  OPs still NTA but if it's an asshole competition between ex friend and kids dad I know who I'm voting for.", "Oh I can definitely see that.", "NTA \nI think where a lot of people get things messed up is because they think because we\u2019re friend u agreed to everything they do. But what I think we also fail to realize is that being a real true friend allows you to be real with them in away that a stranger couldn\u2019t and them acknowledging that u care enough to tell them the truth instead of being a \u201cyes man\u201d. But if u play stupid games u win stupid prizes and being a homeless mother is not something I wish I my worst enemy ( i know the feeling all to well I was pregnant  and living in my car for a while ) because this is such a vulnerable time to momma and baby but u did try to warn her and sometime people have to buy that lesson. God ain\u2019t about to made some one else\u2019s husband ur husband\u2026 and I think it also brave of u to stand up for ur self and not invite foolishness into your life \u2026", "NTA, you tried warning her and she made her own life decisions. She should've known there was a chance of him leaving especially after getting her pregnant.", "Nta. She knew this man had no morals of he could cheat on his wife he could treat his side piece much worse. She chose this. \n\nActions have consequences.", "I am wondering about that too. Why her number was not blocked? Why did OP answer the call? Why OP didn\u2019t just say that their friendship is over and end the call?", "The friend said the comment was mean. Not the not taking in the former friend", "Unblock her number just long enough to give her the busy body friends contact info then block both of them. \n\nNTA she knew what she was doing, she did it, now she needs to deal with the consequences.", "It takes two people to get pregnant. Yes she shouldn't have done it. He's still responsible for the outcome too. And responsible for the child. \nOP doesn't have to take her in. OP doesn't have to help her in any way. But throwing an \"I told you so\" in her face at what has to be a vulnerable moment is uncalled for. So YTA for the comment.", "What was mean? Telling her actions have consequences? \n\nLeanne did something stupid. She knew what she was doing, she knew it was wrong. She did it anyways. Sometimes the truth hurts but there\u2019s a time and a place for coddling and this ain\u2019t it.", "Birth control is easily accessible and reliable. She got pregnant in an attempt to trap him, she gambled and she lost.", "Yes. Action habe consequences. But OP says she's probably a last resort. It would have been enough to refuse to help. The comment is the equivalent to kicking someone that's already on the floor", "Birth control fails. You don't know she did it on purpose. And even if, for all we know he might have been on board", "It\u2019s fair to assume she did it on purpose, it\u2019s not a big leap and is definitely the most likely scenario.", "And none of those things are excused by \u201ccrazy love\u201d.", "The \u201c I told you so\u201d routine doesn\u2019t usually go over well. You have a right to say no but you leave it at that. No need to justify why. It\u2019s not your job to teach lessons. What\u2019s done is done.", "NTA\n\nThe consequences of her actions are not for you to deal with or magically fix for her. She knew what she was doing. \n\nI feel sorry for the kid, but that also isn't your problem to sort out.", "NTA. \n\nYour ex-friend is responsible for their own actions. You are not responsible for them or their decisions. Whether you are able (or want) to extend any support to them is a function of your ability and your willingness to do so, not an obligation.", "I mean, the \"I told you so\" was a bit petty, but not completly undeserved. Not taking her in is fine. You don't need to support another person, especially someon who is not your friend, if you don't want to. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I have no respect or sympathy for cheaters on either side. She dug her hole, she can lie in it.", "Not really. That dad's gone.  The only parent that kid has is the dumbass mom. She tried to baby trap and failed unfortunately for the kid", "> She should've known there was a chance of him leaving especially after getting her pregnant.", " She knew what she was doing.\n\nI feel sorry for the kid", "Yeah and no one would bother posting an \"I took in my friend in need and it all worked out hunkydory\" story.", "not your disco, not your panic.", "> His betrayal is actually larger as he is married with a child!\n> \n>", "Yes what he did and has fine is way worse. But he\u2019s not the OPs friend.  OP ended her friendship with this women over her making such poor decisions. The poor decisions have now fucked the friend over and she\u2019s desperate, that\u2019s awful for but those close to her apparently told he to stop and she refused to listen. It\u2019s not on her former friends to fix this problem for her. She\u2019s and idiot and that guy she hooked up with is garbage.", "99% she did it on purpose.  Even if the pregnancy wasn't an accident she still chose not to get an abortion.  He chose to abort her though lol", "Occam's razor.  \n\nThe simplest explanation is usually the truth.  If you go to baseball game, there's probably going to be a baseball.", "Why is my man moving away with his side chick!?\n\nHold me back before I hurt her feelings.\n\nYou were always the side chick."]}
