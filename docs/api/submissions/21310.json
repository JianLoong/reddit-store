Turns out, they never did that, and have apparently been driving the car with those cancelled plates still on the car ever since.  \n\nFast forward a bit, we ended up getting in touch with the buyer, and they seem to be more surprised that we got a bill since they \"have an EZ pass\", and they just want us to pay the bill and pay us back. They will not fess up to driving the car with our old plates still on it. They live a few states away, and none of us (including my sister) have seen them or the car since we sold it to them, so we have not naturally discovered that the plates are still on it until now.\n\n I do not want my wife to pay the bill, as it will be sort of like admitting that we still have this vehicle (which we do not), and that we are driving it well past expiration of registration (which we are not), and I feel like it would eventually come back and bite us in the end.

Sorry if it was unclear.", "*We ended up having to deliver it part-way for some reason (I do not recall exactly why that was), so we left the plates on the car so they could legally drive it home...*\n\nUmmmmmm... there was no need to do that.  In most states getting a temporary 2-3 day registration for a vehicle to be moved from seller to buyer is easy to do online.", "NTA. \n\nMy older brother was picked up once as a person of interest. He sold a van to a friend, they never did the paperwork. About a year later the van was reported abandoned on a beach in Oregon. Someone was found passed in the van of an OD and my brother was the last registered owner.  \n\nGet those plates.", "NTA.  Follow through and make the call if they don't comply.", "Nta", "Interesting, in my state the plates stay with the vehicle and the registered owner changes when you sign over the pink slip (vehicle registration) at time of sale. That way there is a paper trail and you are no longer responsible for anything to do with that vehicle.  If the new owners don\u2019t insure or register the vehicle properly it is no longer the old owner\u2019s problem.", "Dude, you have no idea the kind of mayhem someone can do to your life and your credit score with this stuff.  Parking tickets, speeding tickets, you name it all of it can be used to jam you up a hundred different ways.  They're lucky you're just threatening to call the cops. I would have done so immediately in fact I suggest you do so ASAP to have paper in case any of the other stuff I've mentioned is working its way down to you.  \n\nNTA they know they're wrong to still have your plates on.  You were naive, and taken advantage of.", "NTA.  Protect yourself.  They were way over the line, were caught, and now they want to avoid responsibility.  Being a nice guy can get you into deep trouble.  I would not even give them the choice; I would just report to the police what you know.", "NTA. The car's new owner is clearly violating several laws regarding use of the licence plate. Contrary to some commentary in this thread, you are perfectly free to do nothing at all, if you choose. Generally speaking, hearing of some plot to commit a crime or witnessing the crime itself subjects you neither to liability nor obligation in the matter.\n\nBut should you choose to take any action that supports the new owner's activities, the world changes for you completely. For example, speaking with the new owner to make a plan that a reasonable person might infer you intend to execute (regardless of your actual intent or execution) what subject you to a charge of conspiracy. And I believe you mentioned that is phone calls and discussions we're taking place between two different states. Oh, joy! This particular crime of conspiracy would, therefore, be a federal crime under Rico. And this is not just a matter of some simple fraud. I believe you will be dealing with some combination of wire fraud, bank fraud, theft of services, obstruction and several others including identity crimes, forgery, evasion and financial crimes. And that's just the beginning. Remember, federal crimes attract federal time (where the notion of parole does not exist). And, on a roster of federal crimes prioritised by US attorneys, this kind of stuff is near the top of the list. \n\nIt seems from reading down that you are clear at the serious dangers you face by participating or cooperating in any way. However, you owe it to yourself to carefully consider availing yourself of the option to do nothing at all. Getting yourself involved by contacting the authorities, or in any other way, will likely offer you no benefit at all.", "NTA- this isn't an accident. They've had almost two years to correct this. You should say something.", "NTA. Go to the police and explain what is going on. Then go to the DMV and make sure that the plates are registered as expired and being used by someone who is not you.", "I think your solution is correct. NTA.", "Y T A if you *don't* call the cops. They've effectively been operating the vehicle under illegal plates that were last registered to you. If, god forbid, something happened, you could get in some serious trouble.\n\nDon't even give them the chance to send the plates back.", "A friend of mine sold a car to someone who ended up using it to run drugs. Thank God she had the forethought to write up a bill of sale so that after a high speed chase, wrapping it around a tree and finding a trunk full of weed, the cops showed up at her door, looking for her. They never transferred the registration and plates, so thank goodness she had that document.", "This. OP, I would text them, so it's in writing. \"You are using my wife's plates on your vehicle, that you're driving, that are expired. This is illegal in several ways. You have 24 hours to show us proof that the plates are in the mail and on their way back to us before we call the police. You are currently committing several crimes. This will be your last warning.\"", ">Now you know to immediately remove the plates when the car leaves your possession.\n\nNTA - In Washington State (USA), unless they are vanity plates, they stay with the car. You have to send the state a copy of the bill of sales.", "They have a week, and I want a text photo of when the plates hit the mail- a lot can happen in almost a month! They didn't want to pay for the insurance, sales tax, and registration fees. They have saved that money for a year and a half - they can pony up ASAP.", "I know in my state it is not that easy.  You have to complete a normal registration with the title/bill of sale/etc to get a temp plate.   They only use them here for the ability to get emissions and/or VIN verification completed prior to final registration... then once that is complete, you get to do it all over again to get the metal plate.\n\nThat said, I do not know the regulations in their own home state, that may very likely be possible there.", "This has already been done.  The plate was cancelled back in 2021, but since my wifes name is still attached to that plate and it is still illegally being used on the road, the onus falls on her for whatever happens.", "You have to remember that there are multiple states in the US that could hold multiple Irelands inside if them. The scale is way different.", ">loads of people have italic or nonstandard fonts or even coloured plates\n\n\nIn Germany you would be pulled over and fined. And plates are registered with the town you live in so as far as I'm aware you must have an address in that town, meaning that you must be registered with the local town hall as a resident. Haven't done it for a while, so not certain about that. \nBut you need the plates to insure the car.", "Same thing happened to me. Got a call that my car had been used to commit a felony. I provided a copy of the bill of sale and I never heard anything else", "u/PriorImplent07 is a bot.", "u/Alternative231 is a bot.", "u/Dramatics54 is a bot.", "u/State2600 is a bot.", "Well whatever. You know what I meant. Give them an end date.", "Are you sure about that?  The whilole point of legally revoking it is to remove your liability.  Like reporting a gun as stolen and later a crime is committed with that gun", "Huh, in my state, plates stayed with the owner, so you could have 40 years worth of cars on a single plate. This was a big deal when the state moved from one plate per vehicle to two - you could tell folks that had lived there for a while since they only had the single plate.\n\nWe did by an old house and back in the 1920s and 1930s they must have reissued plates every year, because the back wall of the garage was papered with plates - lol!", "Right it's not like registration pays for DMV services or towards state transportation agencies. Or wait is getting an id also government tyranny.", "Yeah, there's a leeway of err a month? A few weeks? before you have to register the car as imported & get ROI plates.\n\nAlthough to be fair, NI is a different country even though it's also Irish! So not quite the same example as county to county.", "u/Suspicioucw is a bot.\n\nPretty sure u/ParkingNoD is too but can't find where it stole from atm", "The car was sold out of state. OP's family's plates are illegal out of state as a matter of course. The plates were still on the car as OP was sent a bill for EZ-pass tolls that were triggered by the use of the plate.\n\nThere is no error - the buyers never registered the car in their name, paid sales tax, or put new plates on as required by law.", "The plates/vehicle were not reported as stolen, just that the vehicle has been sold.   It does not indicate to whom, just that we claim that it is no longer ours.\n\nThe only name that is on any paperwork that had ever existed with that plate was my wife, so that is the name that they are going to go after.\n\nRemember, this person lives in another state from us.  This is not just a simple transfer of registration with the same plate, they would have been required to get a plate from their own state, which obviously never happened.", "Sure", "Ok sorry. Used to being attacked over everything on Reddit. Got over 100 downvotes once because trash disposal works differently where I live, and it couldn\u2019t possibly be different than how all these people know it.", "Yeah the internet can be a hate machine. I get it, no worries!"]}
