I thought this was odd since our EZPass account is in my name, so she had me open it up.

We ended up having to deliver it part-way for some reason (I do not recall exactly why that was), so we left the plates on the car so they could legally drive it home and I informed them that I would be cancelling the registration the next day and that they needed to dispose of the plates. Turns out, they never did that, and have apparently been driving the car with those cancelled plates still on the car ever since.  \n\nFast forward a bit, we ended up getting in touch with the buyer, and they seem to be more surprised that we got a bill since they \"have an EZ pass\", and they just want us to pay the bill and pay us back. They will not fess up to driving the car with our old plates still on it. They live a few states away, and none of us (including my sister) have seen them or the car since we sold it to them, so we have not naturally discovered that the plates are still on it until now.\n\n I do not want my wife to pay the bill, as it will be sort of like admitting that we still have this vehicle (which we do not), and that we are driving it well past expiration of registration (which we are not), and I feel like it would eventually come back and bite us in the end.

Generally speaking, hearing of some plot to commit a crime or witnessing the crime itself subjects you neither to liability nor obligation in the matter.\n\nBut should you choose to take any action that supports the new owner's activities, the world changes for you completely. For example, speaking with the new owner to make a plan that a reasonable person might infer you intend to execute (regardless of your actual intent or execution) what subject you to a charge of conspiracy. And I believe you mentioned that is phone calls and discussions we're taking place between two different states. Oh, joy! This particular crime of conspiracy would, therefore, be a federal crime under Rico. And this is not just a matter of some simple fraud. I believe you will be dealing with some combination of wire fraud, bank fraud, theft of services, obstruction and several others including identity crimes, forgery, evasion and financial crimes. And that's just the beginning. Remember, federal crimes attract federal time (where the notion of parole does not exist). And, on a roster of federal crimes prioritised by US attorneys, this kind of stuff is near the top of the list. \n\nIt seems from reading down that you are clear at the serious dangers you face by participating or cooperating in any way.
