Later that night, she came back and asked if she wasn't good enough for me. I did my best to explain that they are fantasies, not things that all can come true, and that she is enough \u2013 she is everything for me. I know you all will want to know what they are, so here: I like the idea of her being a \u201chot wife,\u201d being pleased by someone else. I like hearing about past encounters and what was exciting about them. I like being degraded somewhat and her telling me what she likes sexually about other men. These are really all things that happened in the past with us and other relationships. Now it\u2019s turned into me being a \u201ctypical man\u201d and never satisfied, according to her words.

How does this fantasy imply she\u2019s not enough? If anything, it implies you\u2019re not enough lmao", "NTA - don't ask people for thoughts in their head if you can't deal with them like an adult.", "NTA\n\nIt's kind of fucked up not only that she got mad but that she set you up for such a deeply personal question without having an answer of her own. It's like asking what is your biggest regret and you go into detail about some biker you hit with you car on a road trip with your friends one summer . . then her answer is 'oh me, I don't have regrets.' It's a dick move", "NTA she is for getting mad. The shouldn't ask questions she does want the answer to. You're fantasies/kinks are common and normal. \n\nHer asking if she's not good enough doesn't make sense either nothing you said was about you with another female. It was all about her with someone else.", "NTA - it sounds like she tried to set you up a bit. Any answer would have lead her to question if she was enough for you. \nAlso, perhaps she doesn\u2019t realize that in a hot wife situation, she gets to play around and you don\u2019t. Perhaps she thinks you want to mess around with other girls too?", "NTA- tbh those aren\u2019t even raunchy fantasies. \nSo long as you don\u2019t expect her to actually go through with those things (and it doesn\u2019t sound like you do) then you\u2019re fine", "NTA \u2014 she set you up and wasn\u2019t ready for it. Obviously, you never should have shared it and you should know better that she might have insecurities or be jealous. Just communicate you\u2019re happy, and say that she created this situation by asking. If she doesn\u2019t have fantasies, just tell her she is being dishonest with you.", "I always thought I was a typical man and never had any desires of sharing my wife or girlfriend with another man.\n\nNTA. She asked, and you answered. And your fantasies are within the \u201cnormal\u201d scope of fantasies, for lack of a better term.", "Seemed like a somewhat benign question but sometimes people don\u2019t need to hear the truth. Shouldn\u2019t ask questions if you can\u2019t deal with the response.", "She should have never asked if she didn\u2019t really want to know. I\u2018m sure your answer made her feel bad. Many women like to know their man would NOT want to see them with someone else. That they are special and not for sharing. She sadly asked and now she has to deal with her emotions surrounding it.", "NTA \n\nYour fantasies are pretty tame. I don\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t fantasize about things herself. Maybe hers are different from yours. I\u2019ve asked my husband the same question and he wouldn\u2019t answer for the longest time, he would say \u201cjust you and watching you get turned on turns me on.\u201d Which is sweet but as an avid romance reader, I want to know all the dirty thoughts in his head. Once he finally started opening up to me, a lot of our were similar. \n\nYou\u2019re not wrong for having fantasies, at all. Sometimes the idea of something can turn you one more than the actual act.", "NTA lol. Your wife shouldn\u2019t have asked if she didn\u2019t want to know. Don\u2019t let her gaslight you.", "NTA\n\nI thought you were about to tell us about your necrophilia or something similarly crass, but your fetish is way too tame to warrant her reaction", "NTA, she shouldn't have asked. My husband is a straightforward person so I don't ask questions which answers I wouldn't want to hear.", "Her reaction is why people lie in relationships.", "NTA most people have some type of sexual fantasy that never actually gets acted out in the bedroom and isn\u2019t a requirement for that person to have a happy and fulfilling sex life. They\u2019re called fantasies because they are *fantasies*.", "NTA- your fantasies are super tame and really she missed the point. Your fantasies are all about her being the focus, her being in control. I mean dude, your fantasy is to be so into her that her needs and pleasure are everything! Why is she upset about that? \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m disappointed in her that she missed how much you adore her.", "NTA she's insecure", "NTA.  Sounds like you failed her secret test. \"Tell me your fantasies\".  Secret test: I will be really pissed if you actually have any.  I've failed a secret test once, I gotta say I was really pissed.", " well no one should try to police your fantasies but I dunno if you should have shared them. Not with your relationship history being what it is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

It sounds like she is seeking a monogamous relationship from you, and you\u2019re essentially telling her that in your wildest fantasies, that isn\u2019t enough for you. Fantasizing is fine, but when something is a sexual fantasy to that extent, I can\u2019t blame her for being wary that a monogamous relationship won\u2019t satisfy you long term. It sounds like she\u2019s assuming you also want to step out of the relationship and sleep with other women. \n\nIdk it kind of just feels like a breakdown in communication. She\u2019s assuming you said things you aren\u2019t saying, but I also wasn\u2019t there to hear how you said it. Asking for fantasies means you need to be ready to hear some stuff you might not like. But I can understand if you had previously been in an open relationship, and now you\u2019re monogamous, that she would be upset to hear that you fantasize about essentially being open again. Relationships with great communication can still have communication breakdowns, more so even because the assumption is that communication is good. \n\nI would ask her why that fantasy makes her upset, and what is it that you said that makes her assume she isn\u2019t enough for you. \n\nNAH, because honestly it kind of just seems like she misunderstood you. Perhaps she thinks you want to sleep with other people, because you like the idea of her sleeping with other men. Perhaps she doesn\u2019t understand the fantasy, and is making incorrect assumptions. If they\u2019re things that happened in the past, but you\u2019re monogamous now, it makes sense that she would question if she\u2019s enough for you imo.", "This is pretty much what it boils down too. It'll just make the other person divulging feel crummy", "I\u2019m Pretty vanilla dude I guess."]}
