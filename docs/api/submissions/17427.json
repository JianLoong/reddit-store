My partner (M27) has been renting his current property for nearly 2 years, with a 2 year fixed tenancy agreement. We have been together 3 years. \n\nHe has recently been making little comments about having money issues, nothing direct but I felt he was definitely hinting at moving in. For example, he said that though he isn\u2019t struggling to pay the rent (or the rest of his bills) he is unable to indulge in his hobbies. \n\nAs we\u2019ve been together a while and it felt like the natural next step, and felt like that\u2019s what he was hinting at, I suggested he move in with me. We agreed that as he isn\u2019t gaining any equity in my house, he won\u2019t contribute to the mortgage but he will split all utilities with me equally. So will be saving quite a lot of money monthly.\n\nNow the letting agency has told him that he has to pay an early termination fee as he will be leaving his tenancy 3 months early. The fee is around \u00a3600. He asked me to pay half of it today and blew up at me when I said no.\n\nMy reasoning was, he will be saving money in the long run by moving in with me anyway. I am covering the cost of my property, so he should be covering the cost of his. I don\u2019t see this as a joint bill.\n\nHe thinks I\u2019m the AH because I asked him to move in, so I\u2019m the reason he\u2019s leaving his tenancy early anyway so I should be responsible for half of it. \n\nWhen I told him he could stay at his and move in with me when his tenancy ended (and therefore would not be required to pay the fee) he got even angrier and said I was showing my true colours and didn\u2019t actually want him to move in with me or have an equal partnership.\n\nUnsure if it\u2019s important, but for clarification, he has enough in his savings account to cover the whole fee. I have about double what he has in savings. He is aware of this as I\u2019ve loaned him money from my savings before.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH if I\u2019m being honest, but he certainly does so I thought I\u2019d get some other opinions.", "created_utc": 1684264093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13je5vw/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_half_of_my_partners/", "score": 1862, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is showing some red flags.", "NTA and take this as a huge red flag. He should be aware of his own lease and he already feels entitled to your money.", "NTA, first of all he was the one hinting around about moving in together before you even asked him. If he doesn't want to pay the fee then he can stay until his lease is up and then move in. I will say that you need to have some sort of agreement in writing about who will pay what and that he is not receiving any type of interest in your property before he actually moves in especially as he is definitely showing some rather manipulative tendencies.", "NTA. and this is a red flag you shouldn't ignore, I know im going off a very small data set but he sounds like a moocher  that will just continually escalate if you don't put an early stop on it", "He says he wants an equal partnership. And sure, he won't be getting equity in the mortgage but that doesn't mean he can't pay rent. Or what about maintenance on your home? That's part of what his rent pays at his rental.

There's no reason why your BF can't pay something like 250 in rent each month. He's getting a place to live- he should help with the costs, even if it's a de minimus amount. Especially if he's going to argue that he wants an equal partnership. Than it needs to be- he's helping with the cost of the home you are both living in.\n\nOtherwise, this is just about you supplementing his lifestyle.\n\nNTA but honestly, why would you do this?", "If doesn't want to break his lease, he gets to pay full rent.

Uh, sorry, the solution to that is to take on extra work or find a way to cut expenses.\n\nThen when you unwittingly cave to his nefarious bamboozlement, he's getting a super sweet deal by only needing to pay half the utilities. Big win for him financially, obviously saving him a lot of money. Just think, if his rent was $1200 per month alone and utilities another $300, and say bills at yours come to $350 per month not including food he's saving over $1100 per month by moving in with you and he's griping about paying for the early termination fee?

But both of you, and a lot of people on Reddit need to learn more about home ownership, mortgage, and splitting bills with SOs or roommates.\n\nIt would be entirely unfair for you if he didn't pay part of the mortgage. You, or anyone else are not taking advantage for asking for half of the mortgage or half of fair market value. Because while their argument is always about equity and not getting any ownership of of it. They also are not taking any risk. And did not have to save up for the down payment. And are not paying taxes or insurance. And I guarantee they will not be splitting the cost of replacing appliances, plumbing repairs, a new roof, maintenance.\n\nBuying/owning a house isn't just free money and saving money vs renting. There is a reason that people lose their house all of the time and have to go back to renting.\n\nYou have nobody to call or call back on when things go wrong. You don't keep up with pressure washing and repainting the house just so it looks pretty. It's to make sure you can see when any damage starts happening. And paint is the first and almost most important layer of defence against the elements. And if you do not keep up with painting and caulking and sealing every few years your house will literally start falling apart choosing even more.\n\nAnd problems with plumbing, electrical, and heating/cooling can come up out of nowhere and cost thousands of dollars. That you have to be ready to spend immediately, since the problems tend to get worse and more expensive the longer you leave them.\n\nAnd same with roofing. Most roofs need to be replaced every 15-20 years depending on location and your if roof. To the tune of 6-10k, and upwards to 60-90k for more expensive roofs like various tile roofs. And if you let a roof deteriorate or leak, the immediate cost is new insulation and drywall repair. But if you let it go too long you can add more drywall repair, mold remediation, and framing to replace rotting wood.\n\nThe cost and the labor involved with owning a home is much higher than a lot of people realize. So on top of all of the work and risk, you need to keep a repair fund, or keep your credit and spending in check to be able to write a 5-10k check at any given moment, and the ability to spend up to 30k on very short notice.\n\nSo after all of that, if someone thinks they are being taken advantage of by being asked to pay a reduced rate than they probably would on their own. They either aren't aware of all of the risk and cost involved or they are simply selfish. Because it is not just sunshine and rainbows when you own a house, or else nobody would ever rent period.", "NTA - It was super kind of you to offer to let him move in rent free.
