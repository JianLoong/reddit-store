My partner (M27) has been renting his current property for nearly 2 years, with a 2 year fixed tenancy agreement. We have been together 3 years. \n\nHe has recently been making little comments about having money issues, nothing direct but I felt he was definitely hinting at moving in. For example, he said that though he isn\u2019t struggling to pay the rent (or the rest of his bills) he is unable to indulge in his hobbies. \n\nAs we\u2019ve been together a while and it felt like the natural next step, and felt like that\u2019s what he was hinting at, I suggested he move in with me. We agreed that as he isn\u2019t gaining any equity in my house, he won\u2019t contribute to the mortgage but he will split all utilities with me equally. So will be saving quite a lot of money monthly.\n\nNow the letting agency has told him that he has to pay an early termination fee as he will be leaving his tenancy 3 months early. The fee is around \u00a3600. He asked me to pay half of it today and blew up at me when I said no.\n\nMy reasoning was, he will be saving money in the long run by moving in with me anyway. I am covering the cost of my property, so he should be covering the cost of his. I don\u2019t see this as a joint bill.\n\nHe thinks I\u2019m the AH because I asked him to move in, so I\u2019m the reason he\u2019s leaving his tenancy early anyway so I should be responsible for half of it. \n\nWhen I told him he could stay at his and move in with me when his tenancy ended (and therefore would not be required to pay the fee) he got even angrier and said I was showing my true colours and didn\u2019t actually want him to move in with me or have an equal partnership.\n\nUnsure if it\u2019s important, but for clarification, he has enough in his savings account to cover the whole fee. I have about double what he has in savings. He is aware of this as I\u2019ve loaned him money from my savings before.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH if I\u2019m being honest, but he certainly does so I thought I\u2019d get some other opinions.", "created_utc": 1684264093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13je5vw/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_half_of_my_partners/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He should be aware of his own lease and he already feels entitled to your money.", "NTA, first of all he was the one hinting around about moving in together before you even asked him. If he doesn't want to pay the fee then he can stay until his lease is up and then move in. I will say that you need to have some sort of agreement in writing about who will pay what and that he is not receiving any type of interest in your property before he actually moves in especially as he is definitely showing some rather manipulative tendencies.", "NTA. and this is a red flag you shouldn't ignore, I know im going off a very small data set but he sounds like a moocher  that will just continually escalate if you don't put an early stop on it", "He says he wants an equal partnership.

There's no reason why your BF can't pay something like 250 in rent each month. He's getting a place to live- he should help with the costs, even if it's a de minimus amount. Especially if he's going to argue that he wants an equal partnership.

Uh, sorry, the solution to that is to take on extra work or find a way to cut expenses.\n\nThen when you unwittingly cave to his nefarious bamboozlement, he's getting a super sweet deal by only needing to pay half the utilities. Big win for him financially, obviously saving him a lot of money. Just think, if his rent was $1200 per month alone and utilities another $300, and say bills at yours come to $350 per month not including food he's saving over $1100 per month by moving in with you and he's griping about paying for the early termination fee?

Sorry your bf sucks op.", "I don't understand this. When people move in together and one has a house. Why doesn't the person moving in pay rent? I noticed a few similar where everyone jumps on this band wagon of not charging rent. I understand the equity portion. But if he pays rent, living in an apartment, wouldn't it be the same thing? OP Will still have to pay out of pocket to fix things, after all its not his house. \n\nAlso, nta. He can wait it out. But serious note.  Don't let him move in with you.

Let him go find something else.", "Oh my God do not move this guy in with you. He already thinks your money is his.

Is this something you want to live with for the rest of your life? Reactions like you've described are not ok.   \n\n\nAlso, you need to rethink how much he pays when he lives with you. Both of your lives should become financially better off with the arrangement, otherwise the power dynamic will always be off between you.

The thought is ridiculous.", "NTA. Sharing in case it\u2019s helpful to anyone. I am divorced. My ex is a good person, a great coparent but our marriage ended after 10 years. When we met, he  was living with his parents to save money, I was renting ( my rent included utilities). I wanted him to move in, he was hesitant because he was saving for a down payment. It did not cost me an extra dime for him to move in- he still insisted on paying for groceries and internet. When he could afford a condo, we were engaged and it became our home. Moral being: We loved each other, we were not petty and were respectful of each other. If someone is that difficult when it\u2019s good, they\u2019ll be awful to deal with once it\u2019s over/when it\u2019s difficult.

You\u2019re NTA!!", "NTA.\n\nAside from his temper tantrum over you not paying HIS bills, I think his real red flag is the weaseling and manipulation leading up to the decision about moving in together. He was clearing angling for you to make the \"offer\", which I'm sure he will hold over your head in the future if you start to argue over household issues. If he can't have an adult conversation about a very big step in an adult relationship, he isn't mature enough to take that step. Don't let him move in with you without a rental agreement. It will have the added bonus of pissing him RIGHT off. But it's important that you protect yourself and your home, so absolutely get something in writing if you guys move forward. \n\nHe is acting entitled and resentful of you and your life situation. You have an investment that has put you in a favorable position, and he seems to think you now owe him something, for whatever reason. Entitlement on this level is poison to a relationship. Nothing you ever give him or do for him will be enough, and he'll always resent you for doing \"better\" than him.

Tell him to keep his apartment and break up with him.", "And if things don't work out, I bet he will expect OP to help him get into a new place.", "That is what I noticed.  He hints around that he wants to move in; you offer to let him move in and now he's turned that around to where he was only going to move in to do YOU a FAVOR - HUH?  This is gaslighting at its finest OP.  All this nitpicking over trifles - I pay half utilities but you must also subsidize my termination fee - in what universe does that make sense?  This is the deal of a lifetime for him and yet he presents it to you as you are some sort of ogre that is taking advantage of him - this guy is brilliant.  I would totally rethink this whole relationship.  Listen to your intuition OP - its telling you something is fishy here.", "This! Omg there aren't enough red flags on the Internet to cover this.

Your BF=AH", "This entire situation is a hand grenade with the pin already pulled! Do not let him put one foot in residency of your home or leave so much as a shirt behind! He is looking for you to support him and make your money and resources his. He's unbelievably selfish and frankly this is a really good attempt at financial abuse. Do not let him get started this way.

In the future, when you do find someone to move in with you, you should also factor in a sum that helps cover taxes and insurance in addition to utilities. That\u2019s still an expense that\u2019s not equity building, and even though you would still pay it on your own, you are also sharing your space.", "Totally this!!!! Run girl!", "Not even covering utilities, SPLITTING utilities!!", "OP should also check with lawyers in her jurisdiction - by moving in and paying rent, the house could become a \"marital asset\" and the boyfriend could try to lay partial claim on it.

Do not let him move in, he\u2019s already showing his entitlement to your money. Don\u2019t get any further into this relationship.", "Yeah his argument against paying rent doesn\u2019t make sense to me for those same reasons. Tell him to go find any other landlord in the city who would go for that. Seems like classic mooch behavior", "Yes, this!  We own our home. Yes, we pay a mortgage payment every month.  There is also upkeep.  Our garage door opener broke this week.  $500 for a new one.  We've had to replace the blinds last month, $1700. Since we've moved in, new stove, dishwasher, washer, dryer.  The furmace has required service. We had to have an electrician come out to fix a couple of things.  And that's not even including the upkeep of the lanscaping and outside of the house.  He should be paying some sort of rent.  At the very least, you need a written agreement of how you are going to handle expenses.", "Don\u2019t show him saving account balance anymore, please, just protect yourself.", "Thank you!!! Paying half her mortgage and half the utilities is still a better deal than renting alone, living costs money! So what he's not building equity, he already wasn't. To earn equity you have to make an investment, which she did and he did not. If the roof blows off, he, the tenant, can just walk away while she, the homeowner, will have to deal with the mess. This guy sucks.", "Definitely my thought. He\u2019s going to ask OP to pay for his new place, since kicking him out is OP\u2019s idea.", "Actually think it will be nearly impossible for her to get rid of him once he moves in.", "that part...", "Thissssss. That pivot from hinting to \u201cwell you asked me to!\u201d Is SUCH a warning sign. You know something\u2019s off, OP. Listen to your gut and don\u2019t let him move in.", "I was about to say \"RED flag alert\"!!  If he is this way about money now, it will only get worse once he moves in!", "Totally agree.\n\nOP how long have you been together? \n After moving in, what happens if he refuses to pay his share of the bills?  Do you think you will be able to get him to leave quietly when you break up?", "Her plan to only have him split utilities basically protects her from that happening.", "I've seen similar posts but also seen other redditors calling out the ops since its their mortgage and not the significant other.  Never understood this.\n\n\nBut she needs to skiddadle since he's obviously not careful with money. How does one evict someone who doesn't eve. Pay rent. Asking him to sign an agreement will just lead to bigger rights imo", "Yes and depending on the rules of where they live he may get rights to stay there if they break up and OP wants him to move out. I know OP is in a different country from me due to the way they wrote the price but in the state i live ,(and a few others) in the US, if they live for a certain amount of time or if they have mail there to establish residency (depending on the state) they don't have to leave right away and the owner of the home would have to give an eviction notice of 30 days before they can leave. Even then the person can take to court and fight to stay longer. I don't know if that is something they have where OP lives but that is something they should look into before he moves in because it seems like something he would do if that is an option."]}
