Baby = f 18months.\n\nBG:   My husband and I had our baby in 2022. She is both of our first so every stage is new to us.\n   The baby's hair is long enough to fall past her chin, soft and straight. Baby has a cowlick that naturally causes her hair to fall into her face when it is left down.\n  She is now in the sticky stage (1y-4y) she is mobile and feral. She is constantly covered in dirt, snot, left over snacks, and other miscellaneous goops.\n  Although I can wrestle her into a hair bow, it doesn't always stay in place, and I don't feel like it's always worth it, or even necessary. However, if I leave her hair to its own, it sticks to her face, collects snot and fruit juice, as well as blocks her eyes.\n\nHere's were I might be the asshole.\n  I told my husband, the baby's dad, that I wanted to cut her bangs for the reasons listed above. He disagreed, saying he wanted her hair to grow until it could all be put in a ponytail. If it were up to him she wouldn't get a haircut until she was old enough to make the argument for one herself.\n  We talked about it a few times, both of us unwavering in our opinions. Tonight I brought it up again, even sectioning her hair to show him how much hair would be cut. He still disagreed, but said \"I don't know what you want me to do. I've given my preference. Take it or leave it.\" So I said \"Okay, I'll take it.\" I took the baby to the bathroom and cut her hair.\n  After the fringe I put her in the shower with him for her end of day rinse. He cleaned her, but didn't look at her. It was like he was cleaning a football or something. Usually he does the nighttime routine, but after they got out of the shower he handed her to me and left the room.\n  He is usually obsessed with his baby, but he didn't even kiss her goodnight or say he loved her. He does tend to pout when he doesn't get his way, but I didn't think he would ignore her.\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit to accept accountability.\nThe general consensus seems to be that ESH. We agree with you. We had a chat together and I apologized for moving forward with my own preferences after pushing him on something he did not agree to for his child. He apologized to her for pouting and gave her kisses and cuddles. They're back to being best friends. As I type this the next morning they have watched tv, played with monster trucks, and now are outside digging together.\n\nI can definitely see where I was wrong in this situation, and how I would not have appreciated it if the roles were reversed. You are right, I should have had a more mature grown-up discussion with my co-parent and partner.\n\nAs for the folks hung up about my other post and confessions, I did not say that I don't clean my baby with a washcloth, or soap. As often as most moms lick their thumb to smear away as much on their baby, I just don't use my thumb. And clearing the sinuses is something that's done all over the country of Japan, sorry you think it's gross, that's why it's in confessions.", "created_utc": 1689996755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1568yjl/aita_for_cutting_my_daughters_bangs_when_her_dad/", "score": 865, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you have a bigger issue than her hair, like...why is she constantly so sick that she's covered in snot? Do you not own any kind of tissues? If she isn't sick, you need to report this to her pediatrician and get her allergy tested. I had allergies as a child and was never taken for testing, nor given the medicine I needed to survive a full school day.

Would clipping her hair up been an option instead of letting everything drape down while waiting for it to grow out to put into a ponytail? Would cutting her hair a little bit really be a big ass issue? Hair grows back, even after a bad cut. For him to then treat the child like it's an object over a haircut? Childish.

He definitely didn\u2019t handle it well but we can\u2019t make the assumption the reason behind it was misogyny. His reaction and the reason why can be exclusively different with one being problematic (his reaction) and the other (his reason) not. When I cut my sons hair around that age (he had beautiful long curls) my husband and I were back and forth about it for a while. But I made the same arguments (he had just gotten over a bad cold where he was a snot machine and it was getting all over his hair). Eventually my husband came around but he was still so sad that our baby\u2019s hair as he knew it was changed. The first haircut is a milestone and can have the power to make us look different and in the case of young toddlers make them look more mature. Which in itself can bring out strong emotions that our babies look different or are growing. I mean I could also be totally wrong. Also- what was he like the next morning?
