Even if you didn't, and/or even if you had done an awful job on the cutting and it looked hideous, it's hair, FFS. It'll grow back.\n\nHere's what troubles me. He is annoyed with **you**, but **he's taking it out on the baby.** An 18-month-old baby, who will not understand why Daddy has suddenly gone cold on her.\n\nI am hoping she's too young to notice, or to remember if she does notice.\n\nBut I am troubled about the pattern this may be setting for the future. It's a massive red flag. Does he plan to do this every time he has a disagreement with you about the child?\n\nWhen she's 3, or 4, or 5, she still won't understand what she did wrong, that made Daddy treat her coldly all of a sudden. But she will notice, and she will remember.\n\nYou need to do something about this now. I would begin by asking him why he is taking out his annoyance on the baby.", "NTA\n\nAH husband has a huge amount of growing up to do. And acting like a jerk to his child to get back at you is completely unacceptable. This is beyond pouting, this is no-go behavior. Make it clear to him.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re cleaning her, it\u2019s causing an issue, it\u2019s got to go.\n\nKids age into bodily autonomy but she\u2019s not there yet.  Not doing anything until old enough makes no sense on temporary things or items affecting care now.  He going to be against cutting finger nails next?\n\nI do believe wait on piercings, etc., but hair?  It\u2019ll come back.", "NTA. Why are dads so weird about their daughter\u2019s hair?", "NTA. Hair in the eyes is bad for visual development and can cause infections through irritation or the kid constantly rubbing their eyes with dirty hands.", "ESH\n\nI don't think dad was being 'weird' about her hair, he stated a practical reason for letting it grow a little longer. He could have bought her a stretchy headband to keep it out of her face, or made tiny side ponytails or put the front in barrettes, braided it, literally anything.\n\nWhen my girl was tiny, she also had very fine hair that was hard to keep in a ponytail, and some hair things would just slide out. It led to a lot of creative attempts to keep it out of her face until it got a little longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n However, I was a stay at home mom, and she was never running around 'covered in snot' or food or whatever. It sounds like you have a bigger issue than her hair, like...why is she constantly so sick that she's covered in snot? Do you not own any kind of tissues? If she isn't sick, you need to report this to her pediatrician and get her allergy tested. I had allergies as a child and was never taken for testing, nor given the medicine I needed to survive a full school day. I look back and hate my mom for that, I was so physically miserable in school. I had to be my own lab rat and figure it out on my own as a pre teen.\n\nYou also sound like you were going to do what you want no matter what he said, which you DID. \n\nHe also sucks for using the baby as ammunition to hurt you, which he will likely continue to do if you continue to do whatever he doesn't like. It's worrying. You guys need to get some kind of therapy or at least discuss this.", "NTA your husband need to get over himself and his dumb idea that girls have long hair. Lots of little girls have bangs just to keep hair out of there eyes until they are old enough to keep it clean and out of there eyes.", "Esh. Ask the pediatrician why the baby has so much snot all the time my kid at that age was never snotty like that. And juice at a year that's bad for their health and teeth maybe limit the juice intake or something but once it's out of the picture they won't be sticky. Some people think it's an important milestone for the first haircut and by doing it yourself without his consent it's just rude honestly. But he should not ignore his child for it especially considering once he gets into the habit it's hard to break and if he does it her entire life she'll get hurt.", "ESH. Two adults should be able to find a solution...   By ignoring your husband view you made it clear that he is not equal co-parent. Did her overreact - hell yes.  As long as it does not become a pattern in your family, it will blow over. But be conscious that if you keep behaving as having 51% of the vote, it will have long term repercussions on your relationship with your husband and his relationship with baby", "NTA", "Esh. Hair clips cost next to nothing and you rode over his views. He should not take it out on the baby.", "ESH. How on earth are these two going to make actually important decisions for this child - like which school to attend, or how to deal with a medical issue - if they can\u2019t communicate like grown ups over a *fringe*? I\u2019m leaning towards dad being more in the wrong here, but I do find myself remembering a number of AITA posts in which *dad* cut a kid\u2019s hair against *mom\u2019s* wishes and was blasted for it, so I\u2019m going with you both suck and need to improve your ability to compromise/communicate.", "YTA. Why do you think that you have more of a say when it comes to your child? It is not a good beginning if you made him feel that his opinions do not matter, when you don't agree with him. That's not a good way to start. Also, '**he tends to pout**'? That's a very sad (for him)/**dismissive** way to interpret your husbands feelings. You think they don't matter? \n\nHim? Because he should have looked for better alternatives if he didn't want the hair to be cut. I am going to be downvoted like hell for this. But he is allowed to be sad for a night. Sad that his thoughts apparently don't count. \n\nIF he continues his behaviour with the baby later on, he becomes a massive AH. For now, I would say its mostly you.", ">If it were up to him she wouldn't get a haircut until she was old enough to make the argument for one herself. \n\nWould that be the same argument if your child was a boy or would he have it cut short to resemble a boy???\n\nBut basically you both don't seem to respect each other's words. Would clipping her hair up been an option instead of letting everything drape down while waiting for it to grow out to put into a ponytail? Would cutting her hair a little bit really be a big ass issue? Hair grows back, even after a bad cut. For him to then treat the child like it's an object over a haircut? Childish. Y'all are married and still can't figure out how to compromise over something simple as this? \n\nESH, but your husband is more of an AH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
