It's a massive red flag. Does he plan to do this every time he has a disagreement with you about the child?\n\nWhen she's 3, or 4, or 5, she still won't understand what she did wrong, that made Daddy treat her coldly all of a sudden.

I would begin by asking him why he is taking out his annoyance on the baby.", "NTA\n\nAH husband has a huge amount of growing up to do.

Hair in the eyes is bad for visual development and can cause infections through irritation or the kid constantly rubbing their eyes with dirty hands.", "ESH\n\nI don't think dad was being 'weird' about her hair, he stated a practical reason for letting it grow a little longer. He could have bought her a stretchy headband to keep it out of her face, or made tiny side ponytails or put the front in barrettes, braided it, literally anything.\n\nWhen my girl was tiny, she also had very fine hair that was hard to keep in a ponytail, and some hair things would just slide out. It led to a lot of creative attempts to keep it out of her face until it got a little longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n However, I was a stay at home mom, and she was never running around 'covered in snot' or food or whatever. It sounds like you have a bigger issue than her hair, like...why is she constantly so sick that she's covered in snot? Do you not own any kind of tissues? If she isn't sick, you need to report this to her pediatrician and get her allergy tested. I had allergies as a child and was never taken for testing, nor given the medicine I needed to survive a full school day. I look back and hate my mom for that, I was so physically miserable in school. I had to be my own lab rat and figure it out on my own as a pre teen.\n\nYou also sound like you were going to do what you want no matter what he said, which you DID. \n\nHe also sucks for using the baby as ammunition to hurt you, which he will likely continue to do if you continue to do whatever he doesn't like. It's worrying. You guys need to get some kind of therapy or at least discuss this.", "NTA your husband need to get over himself and his dumb idea that girls have long hair.

Ask the pediatrician why the baby has so much snot all the time my kid at that age was never snotty like that. And juice at a year that's bad for their health and teeth maybe limit the juice intake or something but once it's out of the picture they won't be sticky. Some people think it's an important milestone for the first haircut and by doing it yourself without his consent it's just rude honestly.

Two adults should be able to find a solution...   By ignoring your husband view you made it clear that he is not equal co-parent. Did her overreact - hell yes.

I\u2019m leaning towards dad being more in the wrong here, but I do find myself remembering a number of AITA posts in which *dad* cut a kid\u2019s hair against *mom\u2019s* wishes and was blasted for it, so I\u2019m going with you both suck and need to improve your ability to compromise/communicate.", "YTA. Why do you think that you have more of a say when it comes to your child? It is not a good beginning if you made him feel that his opinions do not matter, when you don't agree with him.

Because he should have looked for better alternatives if he didn't want the hair to be cut. I am going to be downvoted like hell for this. But he is allowed to be sad for a night.

For now, I would say its mostly you.", ">If it were up to him she wouldn't get a haircut until she was old enough to make the argument for one herself. \n\nWould that be the same argument if your child was a boy or would he have it cut short to resemble a boy???\n\nBut basically you both don't seem to respect each other's words. Would clipping her hair up been an option instead of letting everything drape down while waiting for it to grow out to put into a ponytail? Would cutting her hair a little bit really be a big ass issue? Hair grows back, even after a bad cut. For him to then treat the child like it's an object over a haircut? Childish.

You can already do some stuff with chin length hair.\n\nMom went from \"Mmmh maybe a haircut would do her good\" to talking to it about her husband and cutting her hair as soon as the discussion was over. They took no time to think about a compromise, and she jumped on the scissors instead of having them both take some time to think about it. It's ridiculous. She made her mind before talking to it to her husband, and that's the sting. \"Your opinions about our child don't matter, mines are more important.\"\n\nAlthough the husband should know better than pout at his daughter.", "No it wasn't. His reasons are justified.\n\nHe wants so her hair can be longer so they can just attach it, solving the issue of them getting in the way, and then she can decide what cut she wants. Which makes sense. You'll have more options if you start from long hair than a fucking bowl cut.", "Maybe for some kids but I raised my nephews for their first few years of life and babysat a little girl before they were born who was 1-2 during the time and neither of them had runny noses constantly. And the girl had 4 older sibling who were in elementary school which also has a lot of sickness that goes around and she never had a snotty nose constantly. Maybe they have pets or something or she's allergic to their laundry detergent or anything but to have a runny nose all the time just seems miserable and not normal. And yes the husband should not ignore an actual baby over something she didn't do they should really have a conversation as a couple and both apologize for their actions.", "Yes, true. He shouldn't do that, but that is not what the discussion should be focused on. It's YTA or NTA about her cutting the hair. \nStop focusing on the negative stuff she wrote about her husband at the end. That is a completely different topic.", "I litteraly just told you the reasons. You can tie long hair, gets them out of the way, and then let her choose.\n\nUnless you can her hair super short, it's still gonna get dirty. There's not gonna be much difference if you cut 3 cm. Kids getting dirty are just what kids do, welcome to parenthood. OP could wait 3 months and use clippers so they can tie her hair. But if she cut it a significant length, which is likely otherwise it's useless, then it might take a couple of years to grow again.\n\nIt's \"just hair\", but hair is awfully long to regrow. Also, another point mentionned in comment, the first haircut is an important moment for many parents. \n\nBut you just wanna be right, huh ?"]}
