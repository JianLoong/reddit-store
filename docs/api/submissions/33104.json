Her mom always kept her last name, never once change it and they\u2019re boomers. Name changes is not about being a man or woman but it\u2019s what you\u2019re comfortable with.

A close friend growing up, his parents born in India (though this isn\u2019t an India wide thing) told me in their culture, not only do the bride and groom keep their last names, all the daughters are given the mothers maiden name and all the sons the fathers.

I'll need to call and tell them asap!", "She uses my name casually but on documents she's \"oficially\" kept her name. Part of the reason being she has changed her name 3 times in her life already: once when her dad left, once when she married previously, and once when she divorced. The process is a pain in the ass and frankly it doesn't seem fair to make only one person go through that hassle, especially that many times lol", "I like the Spanish system, it has both the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s last name (FirstName DadsLastName MumsLastName) and they keep their last names in marriage. With kids, they both get the first last name of the parents but the order can be decided by the parents. Seems like a good enough compromise, although still patriarchal, where there\u2019s no expectation of changing names and kids get both the parents last names.", "Women still have to go through all that stuff if they change or hyphenate though. I'm simplifying your comment, but you can't just say \"I'm married now\" and everything magically changes. I agree with good on men who are happy to compromise and aren't stuck with peer pressure from dead people, because it is a pain to change, but it's a pain for both.", "I didn\u2019t know, thank you!", "This is what I do. It infuriates me when my dad mails stuff to me: Mrs. Husband's first and last name.

I usually do not respond if people call me his lastname, 1) because it happens very rarely, 2) on all legal documents my uncommon lastname is listed and 3) my husband always introduces me as \"my wife, firstname lastname\" (I do the same by the way, when introducing him). \n\nIt is not on purpose I do not respond - I really do not think that they are speaking to me.So being called his lastname and then them calling me out on not responding, I simply just say \"that is not my name, so why would I respond to it?\"", "You could, but why. If someone just knows you as \u201cwife of\u201d or \u201cmum of\u201d, it\u2019s culturally accepted that you are the missus with that last name. I will only correct if it is important for them to know my last name, not because I feel not respected. Cause I don\u2019t find it important at all.  What I do find strange is that in the US people refer to me as Mrs his first name and last name.\n\nLike: do you think I am an actual person?", "Yeah definitely correct them! I\u2019ve been married for 2 months and just got our first piece of mail addressed to Mr & Mrs [Husband\u2019s first name] [Husband\u2019s last name]. \ud83d\ude43 I didn\u2019t change my last name to his and I sure as hell didn\u2019t change my first name to his either so I nipped that in the bud real quick.", "Wow, as a parent I couldn\u2019t imagine my kids wanting to change their name to distance themselves from me.

Like having a difference of opinion over children, finances, or politics - this, too, counts.\n\nShe wants to keep her name, either as-is or by having them both hyphenate. He does not, revealing that he ascribes to the type of masculinity where the woman has to lose their name, but the man does not.", "I personally don\u2019t interpret what OP said as him *insisting* she take his name. He is concerned people won\u2019t perceive them as married if she keeps her maiden name and *doesn\u2019t* hyphenate, which is honestly a reasonable concern. If they have different last names it is very easy to assume they\u2019re not married and maybe just dating or living together. Additionally, when kids come into the picture it creates some confusion. I have a friend who did not change her name when she got married and she is constantly getting questioned as to if her kid is hers because she doesn\u2019t have the same last name as their daughter who has her husbands last name. \n\nI think it\u2019s all important things to consider when changing or not changing your last name after getting married.

How would OP feel if someone assumes they\u2019re not married because they don\u2019t have the same last name? How will OP/OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 want to name their children? Will OP be okay with having a different last name?", "I knew someone at one point who went through six different name changes in the process of marrying and divorcing three different guys (maiden > husband 1 > maiden > husband 2 > maiden > husband 3 > maiden).

The mind boggles (his comments not yours)", "You honestly don\u2019t have to justify why you want to keep your name, it\u2019s your name for gods sake, it\u2019s your identity. Women don\u2019t belong to men as they seem to have in the past. You two are joining as a union in the 21st century. He needs to realise this. Also he needs to fully understand that it is in no way whatsoever his decision to make.

It doesn\u2019t matter because you don\u2019t need *any* reason. We just keep sugarcoating misogyny by calling it \u201ctradition\u201d and it\u2019s gross.

Never changed my name, even when we had kids. The kids have his last name, but I chose to not put any importance on surnames. \n\nFrankly, if your bf is getting this upset, then you need to step back. The majority of cultures do not have the woman change her name, so it\u2019s not weird and unusual. \n\nAlso, changing your name after marriage is a lot more work now. You have to file with the courts, pay money, and make an appearance, then you have to contact Social Security, or your country\u2019s equivalent, Human Resources, state department for your passport, motor vehicles for your driver license/state ID, any networking sites you use, banks, credit cards, etc. It can easily take six months to a year. \n\nKeep your name.", "It\u2019s also YOUR name.

You are moving onto the next chapter of your life with your soon to husband.\n\nI think it's one thing for you to hyphenate your last name with his but to meny men asking them to take your father's name is absurd.\n\nThis is reddit so you'll get a lot of but the patriarchy blah blah.
