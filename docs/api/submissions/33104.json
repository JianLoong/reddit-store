A close friend growing up, his parents born in India (though this isn\u2019t an India wide thing) told me in their culture, not only do the bride and groom keep their last names, all the daughters are given the mothers maiden name and all the sons the fathers.

Do I know for a fact that was his thought process? No, not at all. Is it possible this is a factor he took into account when his fianc\u00e9 asked him for hyphenated names? It is 100% possible.

He's Samoan and his grandfather and those before him were chiefs and the name holds a significant meaning in their culture.

I mean, there's even a specific way to refer to a woman's previous name (her maiden name), but no equivalent term exists for men, which shows clearly that cultural expectations are different, meaning men will likely find it more difficult to deal with.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not suggesting that it's easy for women. Clearly, it is not. Nor am I suggesting it is a good thing for women to change their last names. People should feel free to change their name or not, as they will. However, due to cultural expectations, men are likely to have more difficulty.\n\nAlso, my 2 cents - hyphenated names are awful. I would rather my partner keep her own name than hyphenate.", "I don't think the culture of women taking on their husband's last name itself is implicitly misogynist (hello fellow American! \\*waves\\*), but his dismissiveness of his fianc\u00e9's desires because \"he's a man\" and \"that's how it is\" dangerously borders on a misogyny, at least in a modern context. He's allowed to not want a different last name but it looks a little bad that he then puts it out there that he won't consider them married if she doesn't at least partially take on his last name, it comes off as a double-standard. The fact he's recently covered for a cheater also paints that statement in a somewhat sinister light.", "Yup, we\u2019re definitely married!

Me and my fianc\u00e9 are from an EU country but live in England for the past 10 years and have Settled Status, so we are legally here. We went back home because our passport has expired (one of the few EU countries where it is only valid for 5 years...and it is a nightmare to renew in the consulate) and came back with our national ID cards (which by law we can until the end of 2025). We were with my stepdaughter (15yo) which lives back home with her mother so she had her passport. (Sorry for the long intro but needed for context)\nWhen we arrived in England, we had to go to the queue for ID cards, which was the same for families with small children so it took over an hour to get to the border patrol officer.\nHe called us through, I handed all our documents, he immediately put our ID cards on the counter and asked where our passports were, rudely. I told him we went to renew them back home so only had the ID cards but we have Settled Status so we can use them until end of 2025. He curled his lip even more and said \"you NEED your passports!\" to which I said again that we have renewed them but we can still use our ID cards as we have Settled Status. He told me to stop arguing and that it was until 2024 (not true but even uf it was, we were still fine) and kept asking for the passports. I said I wasn't arguing, I was stating the law and we are waiting for the new passports to arrive. I was worried at this point that we would take even longer to get out of there, felt like a criminal, specially with a child with us. Reluctantly, he looked at the ID cards and sent us through.\nI complained big time but, of course, they said that he needs to enforce the law (which I am completely fine with and of course it is his job, that wasn't the problem) and that was it. I replied saying all this and told them that I understand they will be on their officer's side but they need to check his attitude.\nSorry again for the long text...", "That's crazy! The same officer from my original comment also asked me why I didn't change my name. Like wtf, that's not your business, my man.

When you get your new passports, make sure you register those to your settled status or you\u2019ll forever keep getting kicked out the eGates and have to keep going up to the desk.", "I changed the document attached to the Settled status to the ID card. He didn't even check, he literally put it on the counter as soon as I handed it to him. I received the new passports a week later and updated everything."]}
