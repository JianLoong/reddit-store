The reward for being a part of your life is the honor of giving you away on your wedding day, you're being more than charitable to include a man who hasn't been a significant part of your life in years. He wants to do all the dad things and give you sage life advice and have you listen unquestioningly but he never put the time in to earn your trust and respect, you don't get to just pop into your kids life for major life events and expect to be shown the same affection and respect as someone who was there the whole time.\n\nTell your dad that he can do whatever he wants, you've got someone you know will be there for you and who was there for you to walk you down the aisle regardless if he chooses to be a part of your life or not. He may have given you his DNA but he wasn't there to raise you into the person you are today.", "Oof, hard NTA. He just wants to show off. He wasn't around so he doesn't get a say in how you conduct your life or your wedding.\n\nCongratulations, by the way.", "NTA. Given the situation I think you were very generous in including your bio dad on the website and in the ceremony.", "NTA\n\nWeddings bring out so much entitlement. You don\u2019t owe him a walk down the aisle. He wasn\u2019t there for you then, there are the consequences.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't bother to be around since you were only 8.  He gets no say.", "NTA. I'm surprised you're even allowing him to walk you down the aisle.", "NTA.  This is exactly what my daughter did and it was appropriate and beautiful as her stepdad also loved her like a father and had been in that role since she was 4.  You stick to your guns on this one.", "NTA. Tell him the walk down the aisle started when you were born and he was the one who chose to walk away. He's lucky to be allowed the honor at all.", "NTA but I'm confused why he would be listed as father of the bride or why he would be one of the ones walking you down the aisle. He is biologically related to you but he's not a father. He's basically a stranger at this point.", "NTA. He is about one notch above a sperm donor. Your stepfather is much more of a father and deserves the honor of walking you down the aisle.", "NTA. I\u2019m NOWHERE BEAR getting married, but I already know for a FACT that I won\u2019t have my birth father walking me down that aisle. He left when I was 5, both him and my mom were young - mom was only around 21-22 - and he\u2019s been completely absent in my life until a few months ago. I know that I will either have my mom or stepdad walk me down the aisle, if I ever do decide to get married. The most my birth father will get is an invitation. So, no, you are NTA for wanting to have the man who was more of a father figure to you walk you down the aisle.\n\n\nAlso wtf is this \u201cI\u2019m your only dad and it\u2019s my place to walk you down the aisle\u201d bullsh*t?

I can empathize because I had a dad similar but not as bad. I'm sorry you're going through this. \n\nLosing hope is hard in the moment but I think it helps you see things as they truly are, which helps you heal and move on. You do have a great dad - your stepdad. I'd focus on your mom and stepdad and your fianc\u00e9. You're doing great!", "My daughter did not allow her absent father to walk her down the aisle. For the most part, he was a spectator. She allowed him to watch MY uncles walk her down the aisle as my father was deceased. He wasn\u2019t allowed to attend the reception.
