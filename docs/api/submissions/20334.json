You all have the same bio dad. Their bio mom is your stepmom who also adopted you. I'm sure they have multiple kids in their classes at school with the exact same family set up.

You have a 12 year old sister? How is it possible that she doesn't know things like wedding dates, and stories of how your parents met, and has figured out that your mom can't be your bio mom, because she met your dad after you were born...\n\nThis is such a normal situation. Before he married your mom, your dad was married to another person. She's your bio mom, and she ran off and left you with your dad.

No need to put anyone here in a pillory.", "You don't sound like the asshole, no. I do wonder if you did listen to your father as well though. His feelings are also valid.", "YTA you look to implode a family because it suits you at a time it suits you.  Grace is not one of your strong suits and you spit on the family that loved you when no one else did... there are a lot more deserving kids who should have been adopted instead.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
