My dad remarried when I was 12 and my mom adopted me. She truly has been the only mom I\u2019ve ever known/remembered. I\u2019ve called her \u201cmom\u201d long before she adopted me. We are very close. Until now, I haven\u2019t thought anything negative about either of my parents.\n\nIn the years since, my parents had 2 more kids, a 12 year old girl and a 6 year old boy. I am very close with both of them as well.\n\nRecently, I discovered I have a 22 year old half-brother, Kyle, from my bio mom. Yeah, the math adds up and we now know she took off because she cheated on my dad and married the father of my brother. While bio mom and I still haven\u2019t seen or spoken, Kyle and I have been getting to know each other. He lives quite a bit away but is now coming to visit and is potentially moving to the area after he graduates college as there\u2019s more job opportunities for him and his girlfriend.\n\nI mentioned to my parents that\u2019s he\u2019s attending my fianc\u00e9\u2019s baby shower and I planned to introduce him to everyone then. It was then they revealed my younger siblings know nothing about me being adopted. It something I didn\u2019t know, honestly because me being adopted doesn\u2019t come up a lot. I don\u2019t like to think about or discuss my bio mom. My mom has always made sure to make me feel loved and wanted, just as much as her bio kids.\n\nI told my parents it was time for them to explain it to my siblings as I\u2019m not going to hide who he is. They feel my youngest brother isn\u2019t old enough to understand and that my sister wouldn\u2019t keep the secret. I pointed out it doesn\u2019t need to be a secret and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s literature or some way to bring it up.\n\nThis didn\u2019t turn into a huge thing. They did end up telling my siblings (and outside a few questions, they did get it). However, some people I\u2019ve spoken to feel it wasn\u2019t right for me to ask this of them. My dad said he felt I \u201crushed him\u201d. My mom was the only one who said I was right (outside my fianc\u00e9).\n\nWas I wrong?\n\n\nEDIT: stop treating this as something it\u2019s not. My parents weren\u2019t doing this maliciously or to hurt anyone. Yes, everyone else knew I was adopted, mostly because they were there when it happened. They don\u2019t make a big deal of it to every single person who enters their lives, but honestly neither do I. The only people I\u2019ve told in recent years are my fianc\u00e9 and her family, when I first met them, as obviously they\u2019re important. It\u2019s the same with them. \n\nMy parents didn\u2019t want to tell my siblings as they didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get it, as well as not wanting them to treat me differently. That\u2019s all.

Doesnt seem like a huge deal to explain that to siblings to me but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "You can have an opinion. There\u2019s a difference between opinion and fact. The fact is, I was adopted. There\u2019s no opinion. It\u2019s a legal fact. Not something your opinion changes. \n\nYou didn\u2019t share you were autistic, so don\u2019t jump to that now.", "Got it, but also still don't understand why this was a big deal to your family at all.", "NTA. The truth is always best. My siblings are adopted, and they\u2019ve always known it. I\u2019ve always known it. It didn\u2019t cause us any harm.", "NTA. I was 11ish when my parents told me a cousin was adopted and after my initial \"Wait they're still my cousin right\" I did not give a fuck. I remember being annoyed that my parents and Nana kept cornering me trying to get me to admit I had feelings about it I didn't have. \n\nThey were still my cousin which was all that mattered to me (and that people kept interrupting my reading to talk about it which was annoying lol). \n\nI mean how hard is it to say \"You know how mom gave birth to you? Well some other lady gave birth to OP. But I loved OP so much when I met them and eventually they agreed to let me adopt them which means I got to be their mom just like I get to be your mom\". Along with assurances that y'all are still siblings.", "NTA adoption isn\u2019t anything to be ashamed about and it\u2019s sad that there are people who think it should be.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your personal history, so it would be unfair to expect you to keep it secret from your siblings. Your parents meant well, and may well have been influenced by the ideas about adoption that were prevalent when they came of age (there's a lot of stigma in older generations), but ultimately it would have been better for everyone if they told your adoptive siblings right away.", "I don\u2019t think people are saying that your parents are sus but more like you not adopted in the true meaning of the word since all 3 of you have the same dad. So, people don\u2019t understand the need for secrecy or why your parents thought your younger siblings would have trouble understanding it.", "There is nothing wrong with letting the other siblings know. They need to understand that it doesn't make you less of a brother to them. You are always going to be their big brother and now they have another sibling. Yes, a sibling of a sibling can make a sibling.  More people to love.", "NAH except for bio mom. All parties were nervous, you didn\u2019t feel it was your responsibility to explain, your parents didn\u2019t think your siblings were ready, you disagreed, they didn\u2019t want the \u2018reveal\u2019 happening at the baby shower. Your dad feeling rushed is valid, though he had years to prepare, but by your own admission you don\u2019t talk about, nor like talking about, your parentage situation, so you can\u2019t blame him for not expecting you to move so quickly towards being close with your maternal half brother.", "NTA.\n\n\u201cRushed\u201d? After 14 years? People have won and lost empires in less time. He was likely never going to say anything ever if you didn\u2019t", "NTA, I think people forget what we were really able to grasp as kids? I was completely fine figuring out my siblings were either half related or adopted. I was more upset that my parents purposely hid the information as if I cared about them any less or saw them any differently? It's weird to treat it like it's taboo.", "NTA. Don\u2019t your siblings know how long your parents have been married? The math doesn\u2019t add up. The problem with keeeping a secret like this from them is that they will feel that they\u2019ve been lied to. You being their half sibling should never have Ben made an issue. Your parents treated it like it was wrong, or a dirty secret. You were folded in to your step mother\u2019s family, and that\u2019s wonderful. Nothing to be ashamed of. \n\nGood for you for not hiding your brother or keeping him secret.", "Some kids are just not interested in their parents' relationship history and their parents don't bring it up unprompted. I could not tell you a single milestone date in my parents' relationships.", "Yeah that\u2019s really throwing me too - it\u2019s not at all unusual for people to have kids before getting married these days! I\u2019ve been to several weddings in the last few years where the couple\u2019s kids were in the wedding.", "Rush? He had 12 years to figure it out. NTA.", "NAH, really. You let them know you needed the truth to be shared. There was some hesitation on their part, but they did it; and it turned out fine. Your dad felt rushed. I suspect he'll get over it.\n\nTruth is, truth is better than secrets.\n\n(From someone quite familiar with adopted and bio kids; the risks and benefits of telling the truth; and the risks (and no real benefit) of not telling the truth)", "NTA\ud83d\udc9b", "NTA. Your parents made the situation by not being upfront from the start, but I can see their reasoning (wanting you to be closer to your half-siblings). As soon as they knew there was another one, they had to abandon that stance and tell the truth. By not doing it until now, they've created a possibly difficult situation (people don't like things hidden from them) but it sounds like your siblings (half, technically) are taking it in their stride. Hope you can have a good relationship with your \"new\" brother too.", "They coulda just not told her when they met but made it sound like a super long relationship that they tied the knot on after 12 years? She might've put two and two together soon enough but might've not cared enough in the end cuz she's a preteen", "Good point", "Eh, NTA. I understand your parents maybe feeling a bit rushed into it, but I also think it would've been acceptable for you to be the one to tell your younger siblings, especially if you get along with them well. I'm really glad that it sounds like things have gone mostly amicably, and I think full transparency about things like this is the best way to avoid hurt down the line.", "NTA at all. I don't see anything wrong with letting your siblings know that you were adopted.\n\nHowever, I think your father may not be comfortable with your guest list for a different reason. Your biological mother cheated on him and got pregnant. Now, you want to introduce THAT child born of infidelity to the one who was cheated on. Sure, it's been a while, but it will still bring back memories (and emotions).", "i\u2019ve never been formally/legally adopted but i was raised by my grandparents and i\u2019ve always known that both my brothers have different dads, and that wasn\u2019t an issue. i know i\u2019m kinda repeating what others said where like, as long as you don\u2019t make it a big deal, it won\u2019t be. so NTA, you\u2019re chillin with wanting it to be out in the open. it\u2019s your life and your experience yk, no one should make it seem like it should be a secret ? idk. this is all just imo. always different for different families !", "OP said that she called her mom way before they got married, so presumably they still have parent-y OP stories for that time that just aren't that interesting to OP's younger sibling so they didn't ask much bc it just made sense that they were young parents and got married later.", "NTA, but I understand why your dad feels like you \"rushed him\". Some people just don't like being put in an uncomfortable position. I know you believe there's nothing to be uncomfortable about but comfort is up to the individual to decide. You put him in one, but it's not like you weren't justified. He'll get over it. It bothers him right now, but people who are like this don't dwell on it that long, especially when they know it needed to be done.\n\nAlternatively, might I suggest he may take issue with having to meet the son of the person his ex wife cheated on him with? I don't know him and I don't know you but do take some time to consider how he might be feeling about it. He's a person with feelings and being put in this situation is not something everyone perceives as \"just another day\". Just try to out yourselves in his shoes and make sure he's ok with what you're asking him to do. Him trying to delay telling your siblings may have just been an indirect way of avoiding meeting your brother.  Men can be pretty reserved. You should talk to him and clarify on this.", "NTA\n\nWhat can happen is that parents have every intention to tell the kids but are waiting for the best time... but that time is never right and then the kids find out as adults.\n\nIn your case what's changed is the existence of your half brother.  If he didn't exist or you never met, then likely your brother and sister may not have found out for many years because one day it would slip.\n\nYour dad likely has other reasons to feel the way he does and it will be linked to your mothers cheating and then leaving him and abandoning her child.  Sounds a bit like a trauma response to say he felt rushed... he perhaps hasn't really processed what happened all those years ago and may benefit from talking to someone.  Your mother doesn't have the same bias as you were born before she even met your dad.\n\nYou were 14 when your sister was born and it's not as though you were visiting your mom regularly for her to notice.  By the time she'd have any real comprehension you were essentially an adult and free to do your own things so it's not like it would ever come up.\n\nIt's also less of an adoption issue but rather explaining that your dad had been married before and you are the product of that relationship but your biological mother had nothing to do with you and your mom took over that role and officially adopted you to allow her to make decisions for you (rightly so).\n\nThe other thing is that your situation isn't that unusual and your brother and sister will have many kids in their class at school whose biological parents have broken up and some don't see their other parent.", "NTA\n\nThey were just trying to protect the younger siblings, I don't see any harm in it. Especially since you told them how you felt and they respected it and told them. It shouldn't be a big secret, and it seems it's other people influencing you to feel that way and not really your parents. Idk what the time span was, but if there was only a couple days between telling them and him coming... I could see how that felt rushed to them. But glad all is well", "NTA. as someone with a brother almost 15 years older than I am and who has a different bio dad, him having a different dad has never made him any less my brother. my bio dad has raised him from the time he got with our mom. I've always known about it. not sure what your parents are so worried about", "Maybe fully adopted depending on local laws. I\u2019m from my mom\u2019s first marriage. When my stepdad decided to adopt me, both my mom and my biological father had to give up custody so my my and stepdad could adopt me. Wierd, I know. I was also ten at the time , so I had to sign consent papers.", "Exactly, ever since we could comprehend things, my mom was very open about me and my brother having different fathers. Frankly it\u2019s easier to bring it up when kids are hella young instead of having to change their worldview of their family later on, especially as a 12 year old! Even in kindergarten my brother brought up our uncle as being his \u201cdad\u201d (as the main male role model in his/our lives without our actual fathers) when the other kids were talking about their own dads, because we both knew our uncle was the closest we had to a dad, and *none* of the kids found it weird.\n\nAlso, just think of how many are divorced after having kids - those kids often end up having step siblings when their parents find a new partner or might also get half siblings later on. Kids understand way more than too many adult give them credit for."]}
