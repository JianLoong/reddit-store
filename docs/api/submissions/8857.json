{"id": 8857, "submission_id": "10qxvu1", "title": "AITA Monthly Open Forum February 2023: Trolls", "selftext": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n\nThis month, we\u2019re going to touch upon something that we all encounter, not only in this sub, but across all of Reddit/the internet - trolls.\n\n#**DON\u2019T FEED THE TROLLS!** \n\nTrolls crave attention above all else - and rarely do they care about what kind of attention they get. A troll\u2019s goal is to get you to reply and engage with them, and the more passionate you get, the better. Any response you give to the troll, they will count as a win. Angrily insulting the troll is rewarding them. Calling the post fake is rewarding them. Explaining how you know the post is fake is not only rewarding them, but also teaching them how to not get caught next time. We understand the impulse to do these things, but when you do, you are doing exactly what the troll wants you to do. \n\nRather than give them what they crave, if you feel that someone is a troll, then act accordingly. Respond in such a way that *doesn\u2019t* give the troll what they want. Do not engage, do not respond, do not reply. Simply report the post, forward any proof you have to modmail, and move on. Ignoring the troll is the best response you have to not feed them.  \n\nComments that link their past posts or call out their \u201ctells\u201d can help the trolls figure out more ways to get their nonsense on the sub. When you suspect a troll, there are two fantastic options:\n\n* Report the post for Shitposting/Rule 8! That will get the post in the queue, and we will review.\n* Send us any links/proof of the trolling to [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole).\n\nOn a somewhat related note, we want to remind everyone that there are also some bad actors out there, trying to wreak havoc on Reddit. We\u2019ve had some users say they received a PM from a Mod with instructions on how to get a post approved, or some other sub-related matter. Let us be very clear: While modmail goes through messages from r/AmiTheAsshole, we will never send PMs, chats, etc. from an individual mod. Anyone that sends a PM or chat claiming to be a Mod is lying to you, and you should not believe them. You *should* report them to the admins for impersonation. When you have a question, please message us via [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole).\n\n**We\u2019ll see a return of the deep dives in to our rules next month, with a look at the \u201crelationship rule\u201d - rule #11!**\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\n#[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\n**We\u2019re looking for mods with Typescript experience.**\n\nWe always need US overnight-time mods. Currently, we could also benefit from mods who can be active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.\n\n* You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mood tools are improving and trickling in, but are not quite there yet.*\n\n* You need to be at least 18.\n\n* You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.\n\n---\n\nWe'd also like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar! If you have any suggestions or additions to this, please let us know in the comments.", "created_utc": 1675266371, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qxvu1/aita_monthly_open_forum_february_2023_trolls/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Question: do people just looking for validation (hard to say if the post is real or not) count as trolls?  Example: the \" my evil male SO won't do tiny task X for me even when I ask.  Am I the AH?\"- that sort of thing.  Not sure how to report that, or if it is reportable; but it is annoying and easy to spot.", "One of the issues with this is that whether a post is \"validation seeking\" or not is entirely subjective. What you think is clear to you isn't going to be the same thing that is clear to someone else. Any time I remove a comment accusing OP of just seeking validation there's a damn good chance there are multiple people in that post calling OP an asshole for one reason or another. Even without that, one of the driving ideas behind the subreddit is that it can be hard to look at a conflict you're involved in objectively. [This vice article from a few years ago](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3z5av/reading-reddit-relationships-amitheasshole-aita-helps-some-leave-bad-relationships) involves multiple people touching on this topic.", "Interesting!  Thank you for the reply.", "I'm not sure if it's actually deliberate trolling, but the internet detectives are getting way past the point of ridiculous. Obviously OPs are often not 100% truthful, but it's getting to be that half the top level comments are making claims that directly contradict the post.\n\n\nOp says \"during this argument, I was completely sober and the situation is unfair because I'm paying rent.\"\n\n\nHighly upvoted comment \"op is probably a raging drunk trying to live somewhere for free.\"\n\n\n\nIt's also common to assign bizarrely malicious motivation to random actions. The husband isn't just lazy, he's using weaponized incompetence to avoid all housework. \n\nThe girlfriend isn't just lying about this one thing, she's a manipulative mastermind gaslighting her partner as part of a twisted scheme.\n\nThe teacher isn't just a bit of a hardass, they're a monster who hates children, probably racist and part of a conspiracy to make kids hate school.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure what the solution is, but there's got to be some sort of rule against blindly making shit up to support your ruling.", "Can we please put a moratorium on \u201cpregnant  women craving\u201d posts?  Enough already.", "How often do you sustain a report of a troll (by deleting the post, banning them, etc.)?", "It's especially annoying when the OP keeps editing the post or dropping \"info\" in comments in order to make their partner look even worse when they aren't getting the validation they want.  \n\nOriginal: \"My husband ate the last pancake so I yelled at him\" \n\nEdit 1: \"He also called me fat\" \n\nEdit 2: \"He is an active Nazi btw and also murdered both of my sisters last week. By \"pancake\" I actually meant our neighbors infant daughter who he ate because he likes to eat infants. That's why I yelled at him. Also he hates women\"", "There isn't a great way to grab metrics on that, but I'd guess 10ish a day.", "I\u2019ve seen too many edits get posts removed for Rule 8. They can violate the \u201cpresented as fairly and accurately as possible\u201d part.", "Lol. Ive seen this exact thing play out.", "Even worse when they put the edits on the top so their whole post is completely out of order.", "I agree it's always subjective, but there's a lot that aren't even close. Op has the patience of a saint, while the other party is racist, abusive and completely unreasonable. \n\n\nIt's not a huge problem in itself besides being boring, but I feel like it's starting to throw off people's asshole sensors. People are so used to Ghandi asking if he should have been more passive in his resistance, thay if Op is kinda an asshole, everyone starts raking them over the coals.", "But when you see a pattern of similar subject matter posts, following an almost formulaic recitation, please tell me your antennae don't twitch a bit?", "And it's even harder, because there are legit instances of OP's here who engage in what I call \"bury the lede\", by dropping relevant info that they probably should have *led with*, or that should have been the *original* subject matter of the post (\"AITA for complaining about not getting a refund from the play that was cut short? I was at Ford's Theatre in April, 1865, and...\").", "Absolutely it does. \n\nBut if we start removing posts simply because they are more likely than not fake, that would mean a pile of those posts we're removing are true. We'd be preventing very real people from getting the feedback this community was created to provide them. We necessarily need to draw the line on what merits removal a lot further towards completely certain.\n\nBecause the issue is that while a good chunk of them are fake, I'd bet far more than you'd expect are real. Some experiences are simply more common than others, especially when those things are rooted in something like the gender roles that society teaches people to follow like the example used above. I've seen so many friends experience that exact same problem. I see it discussed all over reddit. There's entire studies and articles written on the topic because of how prevalent it is. It makes total sense that such a common problem is posted about often. Which also means it's an easy topic for a troll to shitpost about when they blend right into the rest.", "Preface: I\u2019m 21 years old and living with my mom. The housing market where I live is a joke and I would need to sell every organ to afford monthly rent.\n\nEvery time I come home cranky I get reamed for not being able to leave a bad work day at work. We\u2019ve been arguing about this for months because I feel like I\u2019m not allowed to have any feelings unless they are happy. (My sperm donor is a narcissistic tool so the home environnement was very hostile for too long, and she doesn\u2019t want to inflict more trauma on my younger siblings. Understandably.) Tonight we got into it again because of a series of events, that were unrelated to each-other, and I was short and crabby when I got home. She asked me \u201cwhy can\u2019t you do it but I can? Everyone else can leave work stuff at work, so why can\u2019t you?\u201d I told her that we aren\u2019t the same person so it doesn\u2019t work like that in my brain. I proceeded to, again, explain how I was feeling like I can\u2019t have any emotions and need to bottle it up and she snapped at me for always \u201cturning it back on her\u201d. Am I the asshole for voicing my feelings and not just bottling it up to please her? Is there some other way I should approach this? TIA", "> Can we please put a moratorium on [insert whatever you find personally annoying here] posts?\n\nNo. They wouldn't hit the front page so consistently if a majority of people found them disinteresting.\n\nI'd add, while this sub seems to lean towards a general consensus, this is an oddly divisive topic in the real world. I think it's a bit of a generational thing but I think we've all met a pregnant woman or two where we're like \"damn girl, you're having a kid not curing cancer\" with regards to some of their expectations. And there are people who do believe that's entirely fine.\n\nEdit: I said decisive where I mean divisive.", "I honestly think part of what draws some people to forums like AITA is a catharsis for their own shit. They're not mad at OP, they're mad at some person in their own life that had habits similar to OP and they're projecting everything they know about the person in their life on OP.\n\n>I'm not sure what the solution is, but there's got to be some sort of rule against blindly making shit up to support your ruling.\n\nAlmost impossible to moderate to be honest, but this is ultimately why the \"this is not an advice sub\" rule exist. People need to take the response they get here in context and in a measured way. OP knows what is actually true in their life. They can accept that someone is judging them, but likewise appreciate they're wrong.", "If you got rid of those comments, you may as well shut the sub.", "Whilst I 100% agree, I dont think there can be a rule against it.\n\nIt seems to me that what I see as 'omg you are just making shit up' is projection on the part of the commenter. In other words, they really are seeing the thing which appears to be made up because it just comes out of nowhere.\n\nSometimes, its not even projection, its just some kind of massive logic / thought failure.\n\nI would love to see such comments banned, but I dont think its going to be at all easy to tell if they are deliberate or not.", "> Op says \"during this argument, I was completely sober and the situation is unfair because I'm paying rent.\" Highly upvoted comment \"op is probably a raging drunk trying to live somewhere for free.\"\n\nWhen you see something like this, check the auto-copy of the original post. It's not always, but quite often a sign that the OP changed the original story.", "This is hard to give a satisfying answer to, because we don't have any hard data on it. The way we use judgment bot to remove posts waiting for the OP to reply means all of our statistics on removals based on report are broken (because even though they are later approved they all show as being removed).\n\nIt's also worth noting that many posts that hit the front page of the sub get a single shitpost report. If a post has more than 2,000 comments there's a near certainty it has one. Many of those posts get removed.\n\nOn the flip side though, I can probably count on one hand the number of posts I've approved that have gotten 5 shitpost reports before they hit 100 comments.", "Can we please have automod\u2019s original posts right below deleted posts? It\u2019s so hard to find them currently", "I'm not sure if this counts or not, but can we do something about people pulling up unrelated comments in order to discredit someone?\n\nNot too long ago, I posted a comment, and someone had clearly spent some time looking far back to a post I made in a dating sub, and used that comment (taken completely out of context) to try to say why my opinion shouldn't count.   Like that isn't even really having a good faith argument.  Its trying to find a \"gotcha\" instead of actually arguing the merits of what I said.", "As long as you're on anything except the official ios app you're able to sort the comments by /old to easily find it!\n\nThe issue is we can only sticky 1 comment and there's no simple way to change that when a post is deleted.\n\n*edit: a word", "Even if they did change it, the leaps some people go to are insane.  I've been fairly early where there was no changes, and people made some crazy conclusions based on what was written.", "I've seen cases of this where OP's original post contained those details, but it was over the character limit. In their edit they edited out those clear details users find important while leaving in 2 paragraphs explaining the backstory of why they don't like their mom.", "That, or when they spend three paragraphs bragging about how awesome and sexy they are before finally getting to the point. Seen two such cases recently, and it really makes my eyes want to roll all the way to Kazakhstan.", "I particularly enjoyed the girl who cheated on a word game with her friends, and one of the commenters angrily decided she was a horribly untrustworthy person who's most likely capable of cheating on her partner. The OP said it was a low-stakes post but the commenter made the OP out to sound like a malicious person and asked why she would post here if it was just a silly game and nothing deeper.", "There's entire studies and articles written on the topic because of how prevalent it is.", "Unfortunately I am on the iOS app \ud83d\ude02", "Exactly.  So many posts are not only cardboard male villians but, as you say, they start with he never does the dishes but suddenly as they get egged on it is that they are 9 1/2 months pregnant and he \"makes\" them walk 3 miles uphill both ways to buy him candy every day.  And he's 300 lbs. btw.\nThat's a big issue for me; the way getting egged on by the validation makes OP go further and further, and also it encourages other people to make these kinds of posts.", "I feel like A Lot more should get removed for violating that rule!", "You just made this history need unspeakably happy.", "It's interesting to see just how much people have made their minds up even before opening a post and actually reading it. On every single post where the OP uses gender-neutral pronouns half the comments have already decided which gender the asshole should be assigned.  \n\nIt's weird since misgendering is usually quite heavily frowned upon.", "They'll remove the post/comment but also send you in for report abuse. Typical virtue signaling mod shit.", "Yeah, people love doing this. I had one guy pull up something from like 6 years ago against me that I didn't even remember saying as this big GOTCHA!!!! It was like dude, in the time it took you to find that, you could've just moved on from this.", "Please report it. It's not always a line-crossing issue but I have definitely handed out some \"petty spat\" temp bans for similar shit before.", "Theres a limit on how much is ok. But I like that we carry our histories with us. I don't do it often, but sometimes it's absolutely valid. I don't usually post about it, but there's so many times I've been arguing with someone, looked back at their history and realized they were just an angry dumb person, and this argument wasn't going to go anywhere.", "It's blindly obvious once you post your own thread. I did one where I was expecting YTA but I thought it was like a fun, wacky, light conflict.\n\n\nThe majority of the responses were both treating it as deadly serious, and making accusations that had no basis in either reality or anything written in the post", "Love you loudly telling on yourself here.\n\nReport abuse is, hands down, the hardest thing to get admins to act on. If you got actioned for report abuse, you were reporting things for suicide, porn, impersonation, etc - something so blatantly, unquestionably erroneous that admins will actually action it.\n\nStop reporting things for bullshit reasons if you're going to whine that you got warned for reporting things for bullshit reasons.", "I find it hilarious how this sub acts like everyone should be absolutely perfect and doing anything slightly imperfect means you're a terrible human being who doesn't deserve to be loved. \n\nThat just reminded me of the pregnant OP who ordered pizza before a planned family restaurant dinner, the family ended up filling up on pizza and canceling which upset her sister. I think it was crazy how viciously attacked she was. She was called so many names and someone told her they felt sorry for her husband and kid. Like, everybody just calm down. It is pizza.", "There are plenty of folks who lie in their own posts through omission and tell on themselves in other subreddits.", "This is neither a question nor a complaint, but it came up on a different thread so I thought people might enjoy revelling in the horror with me.\n\n**Background** Bots are ubiquitous on reddit (although I've seen way fewer stolen comments on here recently, not sure what you're doing mods!) and also AI is a hot button issue at the moment.\n\n**Concept** It's only a matter of time before someone writes a bot to submit AI generated AITA stories based on previous content in an attempt to karma farm.\n\nJust think about it. Imagine it. Visualise the gaslighting marinara wedding.", "I have questions this month mostly for my own interest so if you can\u2019t answer that\u2019s fine :)\n\n1. How many mods are there roughly? \n\n2. What would you say is the most broken rule on the sub, apart from being civil?\n\nEither way thank you for doing a good job mods", "I learned this a couple months back by asking the same question. If you sort the comments by old, then right under the automod comment will be the original post. Hope this helps", "It wasn't on this sub, but once on Reddit someone asked my gender. I said I was non-binary and they responded \"But the girl kind or the boy kind?\"  \n\n\nCan't make this stuff up.", "That interests me too. Not so much the posts where it is deliberately gender-neutral, more the ones where gender just isnt mentioned at all.\n\nFor those, I would say half is a low estimate.", ">Visualise the gaslighting marinara wedding.\n\nHow dare MIL wear a white dress. And good for the brave MOH who threw red wine all over it.\n\nETA: The really scary thought here is an AI trained exclusively on AITA comments.\n\nThe Terminator films would be substantially different if SkyNet was trained like this. \n\n\"Gaslight me if you want to live\"", "You know, I saw a pack of absolute nonsense disappear very quickly once. I think Judgement Bot saved us from it since it couldn\u2019t reply. Not sure how it was visible to me at all but maybe some squeak through. It made me wonder how many there are that get blocked altogether. \n\nJust a sample:\n\n>In the cease we were given in a piece of a combat and our manager were given worried and essentially took her aspect and requested me if I ought to spare a while every day to easy the otter dens, and that this become a part of giving \"affordable accommodation\" for her pregnancy...which I simply failed to suppose become fair.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope Judgement Bot never turns evil on us, I guess!"]}
