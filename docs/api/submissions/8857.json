{"id": 8857, "submission_id": "10qxvu1", "title": "AITA Monthly Open Forum February 2023: Trolls", "selftext": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n\nThis month, we\u2019re going to touch upon something that we all encounter, not only in this sub, but across all of Reddit/the internet - trolls.\n\n#**DON\u2019T FEED THE TROLLS!** \n\nTrolls crave attention above all else - and rarely do they care about what kind of attention they get. A troll\u2019s goal is to get you to reply and engage with them, and the more passionate you get, the better. Any response you give to the troll, they will count as a win. Angrily insulting the troll is rewarding them. Calling the post fake is rewarding them. Explaining how you know the post is fake is not only rewarding them, but also teaching them how to not get caught next time. We understand the impulse to do these things, but when you do, you are doing exactly what the troll wants you to do. \n\nRather than give them what they crave, if you feel that someone is a troll, then act accordingly. Respond in such a way that *doesn\u2019t* give the troll what they want. Do not engage, do not respond, do not reply. Simply report the post, forward any proof you have to modmail, and move on. Ignoring the troll is the best response you have to not feed them.  \n\nComments that link their past posts or call out their \u201ctells\u201d can help the trolls figure out more ways to get their nonsense on the sub. When you suspect a troll, there are two fantastic options:\n\n* Report the post for Shitposting/Rule 8! That will get the post in the queue, and we will review.\n* Send us any links/proof of the trolling to [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole).\n\nOn a somewhat related note, we want to remind everyone that there are also some bad actors out there, trying to wreak havoc on Reddit. We\u2019ve had some users say they received a PM from a Mod with instructions on how to get a post approved, or some other sub-related matter. Let us be very clear: While modmail goes through messages from r/AmiTheAsshole, we will never send PMs, chats, etc. from an individual mod. Anyone that sends a PM or chat claiming to be a Mod is lying to you, and you should not believe them. You *should* report them to the admins for impersonation. When you have a question, please message us via [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole).\n\n**We\u2019ll see a return of the deep dives in to our rules next month, with a look at the \u201crelationship rule\u201d - rule #11!**\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\n#[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\n**We\u2019re looking for mods with Typescript experience.**\n\nWe always need US overnight-time mods. Currently, we could also benefit from mods who can be active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.\n\n* You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mood tools are improving and trickling in, but are not quite there yet.*\n\n* You need to be at least 18.\n\n* You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.\n\n---\n\nWe'd also like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar! If you have any suggestions or additions to this, please let us know in the comments.", "created_utc": 1675266371, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qxvu1/aita_monthly_open_forum_february_2023_trolls/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Question: do people just looking for validation (hard to say if the post is real or not) count as trolls?  Example: the \" my evil male SO won't do tiny task X for me even when I ask.  Am I the AH?\"- that sort of thing.  Not sure how to report that, or if it is reportable; but it is annoying and easy to spot.", "One of the issues with this is that whether a post is \"validation seeking\" or not is entirely subjective. What you think is clear to you isn't going to be the same thing that is clear to someone else. Any time I remove a comment accusing OP of just seeking validation there's a damn good chance there are multiple people in that post calling OP an asshole for one reason or another. Even without that, one of the driving ideas behind the subreddit is that it can be hard to look at a conflict you're involved in objectively.
