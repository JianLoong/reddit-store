Also, a 4 year old would know not to touch someone else's food.", "NTA she touched your food on purpose to mess with you.", "Your entire situation is very odd.", "NTA.\n\nLook into germaphobia, as your situation sounds familiar to me. For me it's bins and toilets. People handling bins or toilets and then not washing their hands. Or putting things so they touch bins or toilets and then touching them and using them as if they hadn't just touched a toilet. Just the thought of it makes my skin crawl and I can't not think of it in the moment. The thing I sanitize most in my house is door handles as I keep seeing partner's family members handling a bin and then opening/closing doors before they wash hands. I myself leave doors open before I grab the bags from bins, take those out, come back in, wash hands, only then touch door handles. But hey. Not everyone's struggling with phobias.\n\n(Though if not having this phobia meant I would touch things after touching bins without washing my hands, I honestly don't want to lose the phobia, because what the fuck even is that?)\n\nEdit: Sorry, on first read I thought anxiety stemmed from the sandwich having been touched, but it was her complaining. Sheesh. No wonder you're not contacting her. I think she was doing it as a power move, knowing you'd hate it. A way to make you submit. No contact is best option.", "NTA. I am as far from a germaphobe as one can be and I wouldn\u2019t eat food that had been touched by someone who didn\u2019t wash their hands after changing diapers. \n\nIt sounds like your mother wanted to pick a fight with you.

Sounds like she did it to wind you up.", "NTA, what did she think?\n\n\" oh no! sonic slipped in drugs into my sons grilled cheese! gotta check it \"", "Strictly speaking NTA, but that is a pretty abnormal level of food safety and you should expect people to find it very weird, I certainly would. Not an excuse for her to be rude to you though.", "YTA.  You're being privileged and immature.  You were inside her for 9 months.  She changed your diapers and fed you with food she prepared with those hands and you're still alive.\n\nThis is more about you resenting your parents' authority that anything else.  Respect your mother.", "NTA your response could have been something like. One thing the pandemic taught us loud and clear is the need to wash our hands often and well. I have witnessed you changing your grandsons diapers and not washing your hands afterwards.  This is unhealthy as a minuscule particle of human waste can cause serious health issues.  Once I see that you are practicing cleanliness then I will not have an issue.", "This exactly . NTA, no reason to be touching your sandwich in the first place but to say she was checking if it was cooked, when it is just CHEESE, tells you all you need to know", "Geez, l just remembered my BIL used to do this to me for fun when l was a teenager.

I feel so unwell now\u2026LOL", "Still OP, your mom is a toxic person, and I doubt she will ever change, she\u2019s clearly showing favouritism to her grandkid, but not you or your sister\u2019s kids, I would recommend trying to take your 16 year old sister, and your niece or nephew out of that situation", "Have you ever worked in food service? You\u2019re putting a lot of faith in the cleanliness.", "For a lot of cultures, that's just an overbearing mother.  She doesn't understand boundaries.
