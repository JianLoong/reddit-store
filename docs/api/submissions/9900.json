It happens very often, almost everyday, and I have warned him many of times. \n\nIt\u2019s recently gotten out of hand, and he has ignored his warnings so the guidance counselor and I had set up a meeting with his parents to discuss this behavior because at this point it is harassment. \n\nIt all was going well, until his parents heard he was flirting with other males. His parents didn\u2019t know he was gay, and his father was very unpleased with this information. He now sits quietly in my class, but I do feel very guilty for outing him to his parents. My wife thinks maybe we should\u2019ve left the gender roles out, but that isn\u2019t really optional in a school report. But how was I to know his parents didn\u2019t know?\n\nInfo: In our schools we have a report the guidance counselor will write, basically documentation of what was said, and the things the student had said were mentions of things to do with a man, comment he made that clearly exposed gender.", "created_utc": 1676340654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111r0z8/aita_for_accidentally_outing_my_student/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This situation sucks and I totally understand feeling guilty outing someone, but coming from a fellow queer person -gay or not, harassing people isn\u2019t okay and you don\u2019t get to use your queerness as an excuse for it. \n\nYou and other students had asked him to stop. He also continuously disregarded warnings from you and other staff that a meeting with his parents would be called if his actions didn\u2019t change. At some point, you needed to act on your warnings and address the issue. He appears to be out in school, and he knew his parents were coming to talk about this issue. He could have said something to either you or the guidance counselor about not being out to his parents and accommodations/special care to omit pronouns could have been made.\n\nEdit for typo and one formatting issues.", "NTA. It was your job to report it and make sure it stopped happening, and you did. Unfortunately this happened, but it's not your fault.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s regularly sexually harassing other students, and didn\u2019t respond to the multiple verbal warnings. Given the context, it makes sense that the possibility of outing him wouldn\u2019t really be on the radar. \n\nIt was a horrible accident. But you were dealing with inappropriate behavior towards other students, your focus was elsewhere, and honestly, your focus was where it should have been. It\u2019s just a sad situation, and one that you can learn from for future situations.", "NTA - The whole situation just sucks!\n\n\nIt sucks that others  in the class are so uncomfortable.\n\nIt sucks that he was outted.\n\nIt sucks that it sounds like his parents aren't going to support him.\n\nI asked my husband, who is a teacher, his opinion, and he said he didn't see a way around it. That sucks too.", "OP, I think you learned a lesson:  if this ever happens again, warn the student of the consequences that will come if they continue (guidance counselor and parents/etc.).  That's a good way to operate with any recurring problem behavior that pops up even in adult life.  Do it early, too.\n\nI don't the student \"had to have known\" as some have said.   Kids don't think the same way we do.  They're particularly bad at recognizing the consequences of their actions.", "NTA If your student was so confortable harassing other male students, there was no indication that his parents didn't know he was gay. Also is perfectly possible that one of the classmates he harassed could have talked directly with his parents. To be honest if your student didn't want to be outed he shouldn't have acted the way he did.", "From what I see it is sexual harassment regardless of gender rolls, the other kids needed to be protected from that. The counselor had already spoken to him. It seems like all steps were taken. You are required to document the way you are told. You couldn't avoid that.\n\nNTA", "[deleted]", "NTA.  I don't even feel bad about what his father might do to him. I've had friends who were in the closet before, and they didn't go out of their way to sexually harass other people. Let the kid get taught a lesson. This isn't just regular misbehavior from a rebellious student. This is sexual harassment, which is especially egregious, even for a high school student. You did the right thing by being completely honest, and whatever his father might do to him is called KARMA.\n\nAlso, you took the necessary steps by warning him before going to his parents (and you even told him that you'd go to his parents if he didn't stop) but he continued anyways, so whatever happens next is on him.", "NTA.  Used to be a high school history teacher.  When I taught I had to call parents because a girl kept licking other girls on the face.  None of us get paid enough for this job.", "NTA", "That student fucked around and found out.\n\nHe had been asked to stop, and honestly, if it had kept going, someone could have pressed charges with police for sexual harassment.\n\nThe kid was plenty old enough to know it was wrong, but kept doing it.  Have no choice but to involve parent.", "NTA. Gay or not his behavior was inappropriate. You were doing your job.", "NTA! He\u2019s sexually harassing kids so much they want to switch classes entirely. He\u2019s making others feel unsafe and uncomfortable in school, and he\u2019s been warned multiple times. He knew the consequences of his parents getting involved if he didn\u2019t stop, so I don\u2019t know why you feel guilty. There\u2019s nothing you could\u2019ve done. You sound like a wonderful teacher and great job protecting your students.", "NTA- all sexual orientations *could* harass.  If a minor is involved your hands are tied. You gave best effort to coach and correct.  Check in and make sure his parents are not abusing him if you can- outside of that- you did your job.", "NTA. He was HARASSING other students. He shouldn\u2019t have done that if he didn\u2019t want his parents to know. Too bad.", "Info: couldn't you have talked to the student first? As in stating exactly what was going to happen. As a pre judgement, I believe the counselor is the primary asshole, as the person that should be prepared to deal with the possibility of unhealthy families.", "Did you ever tell this boy that his behavior could lead to conversations with parents and school counselors?  I\u2019m wondering if you had, would that have given you information to manage this situation differently?  I think I understand that his out actions at school might have caused you to believe he was out at home, but but this is really unfortunate.  I would perhaps apologize and ask if he needs any help.", "NTA. The student didn't bring up any concerns about you telling his parents. You're not mind-readers. I'm a fellow teacher who thinks you did nothing wrong.", "YTA, you could have left the gender specific stuff out.\nYou may have put that student at risk of physical and or emotional harm from his father. We can't know what goes on beyond closed doors.\n\nI am a teacher and I know it's possible to talk about the boys unwanted interactions causing causing stress without focusing on the gender.", "Soft YTA.  Could it have been handled more sensitively? Yes.  A good time to have some conversations with administrators and counselors about how to proceed better in the future.  Being sensitive to the possibility a student isn\u2019t out at home should be a standard practice moving forward.  But you were right to look out for the students being harassed and following through with consequences.", "NTA\n\nhis disgusting actions have consequences, if he was that concerned about being outed he would have not forced your hand to involve his parents", "NTA. He was literally sexually harassing other students and that is not appropriate behavior. He needed to be put in his place. Doesn't matter if he was gay or not. I had a classmate in school who was straight and he was always sexually harassing the female students and would even go as far as touching other females inappropriately. Mostly touching their cleavage and for the longest time, the school wasn't doing anything about it. None of that is ok no matter what your sexual orientation is and it wasn't your fault he hadn't came out to his parents yet and it would have come out sooner or later anyway with his inappropriate behavior. You did what you had to do to protect the other students to help them feel more comfortable coming to school.", "Better lawyer up just in case.", "NTA. His continued words and actions gave you no choice.", "NTA and OP hopefully he'll realize that he thought he could get away with it without repercussions but found out it was impossible.  With any luck he'll learn that he could face severe physical and emotional harassment in the real world outside of school if he continued acting on his impulses.  Although you did out him to his parents, hopefully he learned that he can't have free reign to do whatever he wants to without consequences.  He's lucky none of the other kids at the school didn't physically attack him because it would be a difficult situation to explain how it came about.", "Maybe this is just a difference between countries, but I\u2019m surprised that your school doesn\u2019t have better safeguarding processes to prevent things like this happening. I feel like the first step should have been a referral to guidance/pastoral without involving his parents, and at that point part of the discussions should have been whether he was out at home. The meeting with the parents could then have been structured accordingly - there\u2019s no need for them to hear the specific things he was saying to his classmates if it could put him at risk.", "He's been warned many times. Knowing his parents would be contacted he basically outted himself. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe was sexually harassing students. You\u2019re first duty is to protect the victims from him. He\u2019s secondary. Especially as he\u2019s been told many times to quit and it was negatively affecting other students. Nothing but total transparency is owed to his parents. Their reaction, whether good or bad, is not on you. You can only provide honest observations.", "You had to report truthfully what happened- it meant laying out what that boy had been doing, how frequently it happened- in order to justify why it had to be escalated.\n\nIf the boy was concerned about how his parents would take him being gay, he should have ensured that he kept his behavior within boundaries and no one would have been the wiser until he was an adult. NTA", "Ooooh you gettin fired sir.", "NTA.  \nYou wrote an objective report, yes? As a parent, I'd be more angry at the fact he's harassing people than it being same sex.", "YTA you outed a kid to a homophobic parent - that\u2019s fkn horrendous of you. That situation is why we don\u2019t out people without their permission. You just endangered this child\u2019s life. Actually would\u2019ve been easy to leave gender out - students/classmates/peers all would\u2019ve worked and got the point across.", "Why was leaving out the gender of the other children not an option?", "NTA - Sounds like he was sexually harassing the male students, also you mentioned that he\u2019s been warned many, and still continued.", "NTA.\n\nHe was begging to get outed.", "As a retired teacher you 100% did the right thing and I unequivocally support you. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry this will be long.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your school\u2019s policy regarding what info you can and can\u2019t tell the parents, as well as what\u2019s the policy regarding how much detail you\u2019re required to initially provide?\n\nMost importantly: was this really said by mistake? \n\nI find it a little naive that you wouldn\u2019t know there was a chance his parents didn\u2019t know, for the simple fact that you\u2019re surrounded by high school kids every day and I have no doubt that you\u2019ve seen it all by now\u2026including parents who are unaware their child is gay. \n\nTo me, I wouldn\u2019t think the gender would matter either way. However, I\u2019m an adult in my 40\u2019s, not a high school kid. My guess is that it\u2019s already hard enough for kids these days to grow up. Even though his behavior didn\u2019t make it seem as though his sexuality was a secret, as he was openly flirting with other boys, it didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t hide it when he was at home/around his family. I don\u2019t work in education, and even I know this much. \n\nYou said that it\u2019s been an ongoing issue so much so that the counselor got involved. This counselor also warned him against his behavior. However, it\u2019s concerning that the counselor didn\u2019t know his parents weren\u2019t aware, nor did they really try to help this kid. It sounds very accusatory when in reality, there might be a reason he\u2019s acting out (such as living with homophobic parents). In your post you kept mentioning his behavior and the need to make him stop, yet neither you nor any other school staff realized this kid clearly was crying out for help and could potentially be in a bad place. \n\nDo you know what happened after the meeting with his parents? Once you all realized you had just outted him to his parents, were they angry? Did you think he could be in danger? Did anyone stop to consider what could happen once they all went home? \n\nAt no point did you say that you were concerned for this boy, or felt any real regret for outting him to his parents. I didn\u2019t read that any sort of counseling or support was offered to him and his family. The tone of your whole post felt a little revenge-y IMHO. \n\nThe more I think about it\u2026YTA.", "NTA \n\nLike you said gender ambiguity wasn\u2019t optional in the report. You were right to report the repeated sexual harassment you witnessed, and you had no way of knowing ahead of time whether or not he was out to his parents, nor their opinions on the matter.", "NTA, your hands were tied and student was warned of potential consequences.\n\nIs he getting any kind of actual education/counseling outside of the punishments? One of the sad pieces of this is that the parents will probably not help their son in a productive way, reducing his chance to learn appropriate, healthy, positive behavior around sex. If there's anyone at school equipped to help with that, it would be a way to repair some of the damage. (Yes, I know most schools are massively underresourced in terms of counselors etc.)", "NTA. You didn't know that the parents didn't know he was gay. Plus, he was harassing students and his sexuality is no excuse.", "NTA.  He didn't keep it a secret when he was harassing other students.  It does suck that he was outted, but you're not his mom.  You're not around to protect him.\n\nYou protected the other boys/ young men.  You did your job.", "honestly i think this is out of a lot of peoples hands, because there can be abuse of a child/minor here\n\ni dont think your the ahole for the situation, it needed to be dealt with, he should not get a pass for making multiple other students uncomfortable, or allow the sexual harassments to continue\n\nbut he can also very likely be in danger at home, please try and talk with the school about getting CPS involved\n\nthere is no winner, no loser, no ahole, this just needs to be moved to something/someone higher than reddit", "How could you not leave gender roles out? Is \"students\" not an option? \n\nYTA and hopefully he's not getting abused because of you.", "NTA. He was continually sexually harassing other children. When it's to the point that they want to move classes to be away from him, he's crossed way too many lines. He was given way more chances than men harassing women get (when I was younger)", "You are NTA. You did what you had to do.

You tried multiple times to intervene before things escalated to the point of involving parents and the guidance counselor/ social worker should have been leading the conversation.

I do hope the best for your student, and hope he takes no as an answer moving forward.", "But OP is saying it was handled according to the policies in place.

He was spoken to many times what did he think would eventually happen?", "It was mandatory to state the genders if you are not aware. If I had bent the rules there would be a chance of negative consequences.", "As a retired teacher I entirely disagree with you. That's not his job. The behavior was wrong and has to be addressed. It's that simple. He's just doing his job", "Absolute nonsense. OP had no way of knowing that the parents were homophobic. The child endangered his own life if he knew his parents are homophobic. He should\u2019ve known that his egregious behavior was eventually going to get back to his parents. \n\nAnd not wanting his son to be gay doesn\u2019t make a parent homophobic.

Even making dirty comments to other boys in my class. A few of my students hes hit on have said they didn\u2019t like it...\"\n\nIs it right? No. The student should be referred for disciplinary action. Is OP right? No, take this as a learning experience and do better for your future LGBT+ students next time (ie. build rapport, get insight with their counselor on what's going on at home v. school, make them aware of your boundaries and consequences for their actions aka basic decency). \n\nAgreed with YTA.", "He shouldn\u2019t have sexually harassed his classmates and there wouldn\u2019t have been a report to file", "In our schools we have a report the guidance counselor will write, basically documentation of what was said, and the things the student had said were mentions of sex with a man, what he\u2019d do with said man.

At some point, a \u201che\u201d or \u201chim\u201d is gonna pop up in the discussion.  Also, in my view, acknowledging that boys can be victims of this outweighs protecting one kid being publicly outed for who he harasses.", "Agreed. The student was harassing others.

Just because the student is gay, that doesn\u2019t make him a less shitty person. If this was a guy, doing this to girls , we would roast him and rightfully so.

The gravity of the harassment can be determined and there needs to be no question as to the level of harassment. \n\nIf the student did not want his parents to know, he shouldn't have continued the harassment when he was told to stop. It's all his own fault.", "If you don\u2019t want to be outed, then stop harassing people or it might get back to your parents.", "It would have been a lot worse if the parents of the students being harassed had gone to the police; the harasser should be thankful that didn\u2019t happen.", "School needs to protect themselves by documenting when someone is sexually harassing someone else, and other bullying scenarios. What if there is a rape later or an injury or a suicide or who knows what legal case could come later against student, teacher or the school where they would need evidence. As mentioned above this is the risk the student takes by harassing others - if he wanted to keep his sexuality a secret that\u2019s the wrong way to do it. It\u2019s not like he disclosed it in a school essay and the teacher called the parents to out him.", "While in an ideal world I agree with you, I can\u2019t imagine a high schooler would be expected to have this sort of foresight.", "Really? It\u2019s very minimal foresight. We\u2019re talking \u201cdon\u2019t walk into traffic lest you get hit by a car\u201d levels of foresight, here.", "Why not?  Schools been calling parents about their kids\u2019 bad behavior since telephones existed.", "If his parents didn't knew that he was gay, it was bc he hid it\n\nIf he has enough foresight to know that telling his parents that he's gay would end up badly, he has enough foresight to know that them being called to discuss him harassing MALE students would end up with him getting outed."]}
