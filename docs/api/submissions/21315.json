Growing up, I have spent a lot of time with my friend, Mikey, and his family. Cookouts, holidays, you name it and my family was at his house. And so was Leah. Despite being older than us, Leah has always been much more childish and very stubborn. She acted like a stereotypical spoiled only child, and still acted like this into adulthood. She is also a vegetarian. However, I have never seen her eat a single vegetable or anything healthy. \nOn Sunday, Mikey\u2019s family threw a 4th of July cookout at their lake house. Of course, I was there and so was Leah. When it has time to get food, we had SEVERAL options, both meat and non-meat. While making my way over to the table, I see Leah run over to the mac and cheese and scoop over half the serving onto her plate. I was shocked by this and said, \u201cYou know there\u2019s other vegetarian options right? Not just the mac and cheese?\u201d Leah nodded at me sarcastically and turned back around. This pissed me off, so I then said, \u201cI mean damn bitch! save some for the rest of us.\u201d She turned around again, gave me a side eye, and walked away. She was still in ear shot, so every time I scooped something vegetation onto my plate I said something like, \u201cMMMMM this is so good for me and it\u2019s also vegetarian!\u201d and \u201cMMMMM yummy vegetables! Too bad some people would rather feed themselves a pound of carbs than eat some of these.\u201d I understand this is an out of pocket way to act, but seriously, a grown woman should really incorporate something other than mac and cheese into her plate.\n Later while I was eating, Leah\u2019s mom came up to me and said, \u201cJust so you know, my daughter doesn\u2019t appreciate it when strangers comment on what she eats. An apology would be nice.\u201d I went to go say something back to her, but Mikey kicked me from under the table. So I just smiled and nodded. Making comments on a strangers diet is a CRAZY thing to say considering I was hardly making comments and I\u2019ve known her my whole life. So, I\u2019m wondering if I was actually being an asshole in this situation.

It sounds like you're doing everything right, and I wish you all the success!", "I don't understand 'half the serving', did OP meant half a portion for one person or half what was served?", "I'm a vegan so when I see my options at an event I usually panic because if I eat enough to be full then I won't be leaving enough for everyone to have a bit. Not a complaint, if I were hungry then I'd get something after the event but when you see 20 plates and 1 has some vegan spring rolls... I may take a few extra if I feel like everyone else can still enjoy everything else. This veggie girl might eat lots of greens at home but opt for cheesey carby things on social occasions. Of course YTA.", "He isn't an actual member of the family regardless of how long they have been around. That automatically makes it Not his place or business. Second he was being an AH calling her a derogatory name and all  his stupid comments after she walked away.  He needs to stay in his lane and know his place as a guest.", "No no no. No matter WHAT she chose she would be \u201ctaking food away from somebody\u201d according to your logic. Eating a single hamburger would be denying someone else that burger. Not how shared meals work. \n\nHowever\u2014 she did take more of *one item* than other people. Assuming that other people want less of that item because they\u2019re eating a hamburger, why does it matter?", "Also, on cheat days, it\u2019s good to go above your calorie count because your body doesn\u2019t go into starvation mode, it knows that he could still burn that fat. If you stay on a minimum calorie diet daily, without a cheat day, your body gets used to it and doesn\u2019t burn the fat. Trust me, I\u2019ve done plenty of research on it and it\u2019s my body so I know what I\u2019m doing. Lol.", "I am a meat eater but still if they had so little Mac & cheese it's ok for the cousin to take an entire portion. The other people had multiple options. Also op should have kept the trap shut either way.\n\nEither way if I hadn't have enough to eat but enough to not have stomach pain I can get something after the event,  it's not like if you don't eat there ( cause you can be picky or not like something)  the food in the whole world is completely gone .\n\nno need to make the host and other guests feel like crap", "I've heard that about cheat days as well. And I'm a great believer that as long as they're not doing actual damage to their body, as with anorexia, what other people eat is none of my business.", "Exactly! For example, my sister-in-law is saying it\u2019s not healthy how my diet is\u2026 She\u2019s a stay at home, mom, I am pretty sanitary at work, and I work the night shift, so my entire life is basically opposite of hers. I eat dinner at 11 PM, I eat breakfast at 5 AM, I go to the gym, and it\u2019s a specialty gym, so I burn between 300 and 600 calories in an hour depending on the class, it\u2019s rowing, so it\u2019s very cardio based, then I have a protein bar has about 200 cal. I don\u2019t have anything past 11 AM, I go to sleep at 1 PM and I wake up at 9:30 PM. I\u2019m basically fasting from 11 AM to 11 PM. Not only when you sleep do you burn calories by naturally living, but you lose weight because the water in your body gets evaporated as you sleep and breathe.", "For example, people misinterpret things. At my local AMC Theatres, a regular size popcorn is only 600 cal, add some salt and butter, 650 cal\u2026 Seems like a lot, right? A big Mac fries and Coke combo is about 1300 cal, so it\u2019s about double that, mostly popcorn it\u2019s just air, it\u2019s whole-grain, and as long as you\u2019re not putting a cup of butter on it, it\u2019s a pretty healthy snack actually."]}
