My youngest is very particular about what foods he likes. My middle picked a Mexican restaurant for his birthday dinner, and I knew youngest wouldn't like anything and would complain, so I stopped at Chick-fil-A on the way to the restaurant and got him waffle fries and chicken nuggets. While everyone else enjoyed the dinner, my youngest ate his chicken and dipped his fries in queso and didn't complain.\n\nAfter the dinner, my oldest said it bothers him how much I spoil the youngest. He said I wouldn't have done that for him. I said normally I wouldn't let youngest take fast food into a restaurant, but I didn't want the birthday spoiled. It was a one-off. Oldest said he felt like youngest got a lot of special consideration that the others don't. I apologized that he felt that way, but I stood by my choice not to let him ruin his brother's dinner by complaining all night.\n\nOldest said \"on my birthday, don't do that. It's embarrassing.\" I agreed, and it was resolved. But was I an asshole to my other kids by letting the youngest be a bit spoiled on his brother's birthday just to keep the vibe good?\n\nTo everyone saying they probably had fried chicken and fries at this restaurant, they didn't. All of the food was wonderful and delicious, but none of it (other than the queso) was something my youngest would eat. Almost everything had corn or a corn product in it, and my youngest insists cornflour \"tastes sour\" somehow, IDK and even the stuff without corn was stuff he wouldn't eat.\n\nCan you comment on the post I wrote instead of the one you made up in your head? This was an actual Mexican restaurant, not an americanized one. There wasn't a \"kid's menu\" or any American staples on the menu. It was a themed restaurant that served authentic Mexican food.

But I will add..\n\nIt was your middle kids birthday, not your eldest. Middle kid didn't voice any issues so that's a good sign but he also might not have felt comfortable doing so, so there's that.\n\nYour eldest child has every right to feel the way he does and consider it a good thing that he felt comfortable enough to voice his opinion to you. Also remember that strongly for the future and try to ask your 2 older kids every now and again if they're comfortable and what they think (about their own food choices and that of the youngest). This teaches them to be respectful and understanding of others but also helps them learn to speak about their feelings and thoughts without being ostracized or put down.\n\nWhile it's never fun to have to sit and watch others around you eat while you can't/don't, it's also important to remember where you are. I know the generic consensus is you shouldn't bring outside food into restaurants but I also know many restaurants who don't mind. Having said that, it's always good mannerism to check in with said restaurant and make sure they are in fact okay with you bringing outside food. It's simple etiquette and also teaches your kids something about respect and manners. You mentioned that the restaurant didn't say anything to you which is great but it also teaches your kids that they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, and don't need to care/worry about anyone else. So ya, not bashing you but just some advice there.\n\nNext, based on some of your previous responses, it seems you believe your youngest will outgrow this food problem at some point. Let me stop you right there. You have absolutely no guarantee that he ever will. There's a chance he might wake up one day and absolutely love all foods. But again, no guarantee. \n\nI have a close family member who only eats very specific things from a very young age. He almost never eats anything at anyone's house or events. He usually ends up going to a nearby pizza joint if there is one and gets himself pizza so he doesn't starve to death. Besides pizza, his mom makes the few very specific items he tolerates. He's a young adult now and it has not only impacted him, but the entire family as well as his friends. Though I strongly believe that most of us are very supportive and mindful of him and will also try to remember to order something that we know he'll eat but it wasn't always that easy and still can be a struggle. Again, he's in his early-mid twenties now and this food issue hasn't gone away. I don't know the full details as I don't want to pry him but I know enough to understand and be mindful.\n\nBased on the above, what I'm saying is you should consider in getting some professional help with your youngest child. It can shed light on why he feels that way and if there's a way to help him overcome that. If there's nothing that can help with his issue, then your next step would be get your entire family some help on how to live/deal with this issue because it does and will impact everyone in some way at some point. This can lead to resentment and unresolved issues in the future which you really don't want to have to deal with.\n\nAnyway, I feel for everyone involved in this situation but there's a lot that can be learned and done from this.", "NTA.

I don't agree with the comments from people saying that you're spoiling your son and giving him a sense of entitlement. Food aversion is real and can be tied to many things. Forcing children to eat something against their will or withholding food from them is abusive. My own parents supported me through my pickiness phase and I grew up just fine. I think you found the perfect middle ground where everyone walks away with full bellies. Your oldest child should focus on their own plate and not their little brother's plate. If they're asking why their younger sibling is getting special treatment, I'd ask them if they think it is fair if their younger sibling should go hungry. I'm kind of appalled that their issue is embarrassment. The opinions of others mean more to them than their little brother's need to eat? That makes me very sad. Interesting to note that it was not the birthday child that took issue with this. This opinion is coming from a timid middle child who had to watch their older sibling have a lot more freedoms and watch their younger sibling have a lot more privileges.", "ESH. I\u2019m a fussy eater. Your oldest is doing the classic adventurous eater approach of assuming that your youngest will like or at least tolerate something if you give him no choice. There\u2019s zero guarantee of that, and a good likelihood that forcing your youngest to consume food will turn him off the food forever:\n\nBut you also don\u2019t need to cater to your youngest to this degree. Let him go and see what on the menu looks, at a minimum, least bad to him. That will tell you  (and more importantly, your youngest) a lot about why he is fussy. That helps a lot in figuring out how and when to expand his palate as he ages. It\u2019s one thing to have your youngest go, not like the food at all, and then feed him at home. It\u2019s another to fully write off the attempt at the meal by just buying him food.", "NTA. It\u2019s easy for your kids to say your youngest is getting special treatment.

I was a nightmare, especially at restaurants. My parents did the best they could. Punishment doesn't help, I still can't eat those textures even if someone yells at me or takes away my toys.

However, if you haven't already, I would strongly encourage you to look into sensory processing disorder, ARFID, and even autism. Saying cornflour tastes sour sounds like it's likely a sensory issue. Also, picky eaters grow out of it. If a person (child or adult) isn't growing out of it, it's not picky eating. It goes deeper than that. And that implies any fit thrown over food is a meltdown, not a tantrum, which makes it a medical condition. It should be treated as such. Please do not ignore it.

Just make sure to take the older ones\u2019 feelings into account when making decisions in the future. Parenting is hard work and nobodys perfect.

Oldest said he felt like youngest got a lot of special consideration that the others don't. I apologized that he felt that way, but I stood by my choice not to let him ruin his brother's dinner by complaining all night\n\n\nThe fact you're acknowledging that your youngest would have spoiled the evening by throwing a tantrum over not getting what he wanted indicates that you need to step up and start parenting him the way you did you're older children. \n\nLet him know that behaviour doesn't fly and that there are consequences to him acting like that rather than going through life avoiding everything that triggers him and bribing him when you can't.  \n\nYou're not doing your youngest any favours by pacifying him and ignoring his issues and you are alienating your other children in the meantime.", "At the risk of being downvoted to hell, I\u2019m going with NTA. The birthday boy didn\u2019t care, the restaurant didn\u2019t care, the party wasn\u2019t disrupted. You say this isn\u2019t something you do regularly. \n\nI would recommend talking to your oldest one-on-one during a quiet time and see if he has other examples for you though. I\u2019m the oldest in my family and resented my younger sibling a lot growing up. She wasn\u2019t a golden child or favored, but my mom kind of viewed her as incapable and expected less from her. So I was tasked with doing the stuff she wasn\u2019t asked to do. It was always simple stuff, which made it all the more frustrating. My sister was capable, but her personality clashed with my mom\u2019s and mom would get impatient trying to teach her stuff. So she made me do the stuff instead. I don\u2019t think my my mom ever realized what was going on. She just said I was older so I should just do whatever the job was. \n\nSo, I would say take a step back and reflect on your parenting and see if there\u2019s any merit to what you oldest is saying. It could also be that what you see as accommodating a need your youngest has comes across as special treatment. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unfair, but your oldest might not realize that. \n\nLike with the food situation, you\u2019re trying to make the party go smoothly, not cater to your youngest because he\u2019s your special wittle baby boy. If he were diagnosed with something like ARFID or autism or something and it was medically documented that he needed a food accommodation, it would look different to your oldest and to this sub. But, everyone is looking at this as he\u2019s just a manipulative picky eater and god forbid he have food he enjoys at his brother\u2019s party. \n\nHopefully, your oldest is able to understand why you did what you did if you sit down and explain it to him. Be willing to hear him out if he has other examples and answer his questions. Maybe there really are some other things you do for the sake of convenience or avoiding conflict that actually are unfair to your other kids. I\u2019m not trying to criticize. I have three kids and know what it\u2019s like to just try to get through the day. But, if your oldest is feeling frustrated it\u2019s worth hearing him out and seeing what would alleviate that. \n\nOn the picky eating, it might be worth consulting a nutritionist. I read your comments about what he will eat and it\u2019s not a lot. My youngest is 15. He\u2019s always been picky too and kind of grossed out about certain things like soup or pesto sauce. We didn\u2019t worry about it or make a big deal about it because he ate things from every food group and seemed fine. But, he lost weight this year so we\u2019ve been referred to a nutritionist. Maybe your kid will outgrow it, but if it\u2019s something that requires some sort of therapy it\u2019s probably easier to do that now instead of later. Just something to think about.", "NTA. At all.
