My youngest is very particular about what foods he likes. My middle picked a Mexican restaurant for his birthday dinner, and I knew youngest wouldn't like anything and would complain, so I stopped at Chick-fil-A on the way to the restaurant and got him waffle fries and chicken nuggets. While everyone else enjoyed the dinner, my youngest ate his chicken and dipped his fries in queso and didn't complain.\n\nAfter the dinner, my oldest said it bothers him how much I spoil the youngest. He said I wouldn't have done that for him. I said normally I wouldn't let youngest take fast food into a restaurant, but I didn't want the birthday spoiled. It was a one-off. Oldest said he felt like youngest got a lot of special consideration that the others don't. I apologized that he felt that way, but I stood by my choice not to let him ruin his brother's dinner by complaining all night.\n\nOldest said \"on my birthday, don't do that. It's embarrassing.\" I agreed, and it was resolved. But was I an asshole to my other kids by letting the youngest be a bit spoiled on his brother's birthday just to keep the vibe good?\n\nTo everyone saying they probably had fried chicken and fries at this restaurant, they didn't. All of the food was wonderful and delicious, but none of it (other than the queso) was something my youngest would eat. Almost everything had corn or a corn product in it, and my youngest insists cornflour \"tastes sour\" somehow, IDK and even the stuff without corn was stuff he wouldn't eat.\n\nCan you comment on the post I wrote instead of the one you made up in your head? This was an actual Mexican restaurant, not an americanized one. There wasn't a \"kid's menu\" or any American staples on the menu. It was a themed restaurant that served authentic Mexican food.

But I will add..\n\nIt was your middle kids birthday, not your eldest. Middle kid didn't voice any issues so that's a good sign but he also might not have felt comfortable doing so, so there's that.\n\nYour eldest child has every right to feel the way he does and consider it a good thing that he felt comfortable enough to voice his opinion to you. Also remember that strongly for the future and try to ask your 2 older kids every now and again if they're comfortable and what they think (about their own food choices and that of the youngest). This teaches them to be respectful and understanding of others but also helps them learn to speak about their feelings and thoughts without being ostracized or put down.\n\nWhile it's never fun to have to sit and watch others around you eat while you can't/don't, it's also important to remember where you are. I know the generic consensus is you shouldn't bring outside food into restaurants but I also know many restaurants who don't mind. Having said that, it's always good mannerism to check in with said restaurant and make sure they are in fact okay with you bringing outside food. It's simple etiquette and also teaches your kids something about respect and manners. You mentioned that the restaurant didn't say anything to you which is great but it also teaches your kids that they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, and don't need to care/worry about anyone else. So ya, not bashing you but just some advice there.\n\nNext, based on some of your previous responses, it seems you believe your youngest will outgrow this food problem at some point. Let me stop you right there. You have absolutely no guarantee that he ever will. There's a chance he might wake up one day and absolutely love all foods. But again, no guarantee. \n\nI have a close family member who only eats very specific things from a very young age. He almost never eats anything at anyone's house or events. He usually ends up going to a nearby pizza joint if there is one and gets himself pizza so he doesn't starve to death. Besides pizza, his mom makes the few very specific items he tolerates. He's a young adult now and it has not only impacted him, but the entire family as well as his friends. Though I strongly believe that most of us are very supportive and mindful of him and will also try to remember to order something that we know he'll eat but it wasn't always that easy and still can be a struggle. Again, he's in his early-mid twenties now and this food issue hasn't gone away. I don't know the full details as I don't want to pry him but I know enough to understand and be mindful.\n\nBased on the above, what I'm saying is you should consider in getting some professional help with your youngest child. It can shed light on why he feels that way and if there's a way to help him overcome that. If there's nothing that can help with his issue, then your next step would be get your entire family some help on how to live/deal with this issue because it does and will impact everyone in some way at some point. This can lead to resentment and unresolved issues in the future which you really don't want to have to deal with.\n\nAnyway, I feel for everyone involved in this situation but there's a lot that can be learned and done from this.", "NTA.

It\u2019s usually on the kids menu.", "I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s very unlikely there wasn\u2019t something they would eat. Even something like a cheese roll up. You spoiled the youngest and made them feel special on the eldest birthday, who clearly feels left out and ignored and feels you don\u2019t treat the same at all. And your replies all show you know this and don\u2019t care. You are looking for validation and not wanting to learn from your mistake. YTA a huge one", "I don't think anyone said OP should have made the kid eat food they didn't like. It was said that it is rude to bring outside food into a restaurant, and that by OP's own admission, they were showing favoritism/special treatment to their youngest child.", "Parenting isn't just allowing kids to eat foods they like either \n\nThey have to eat food they don't like to make sure they get nutrients and vitamins so can't live off fast food\n\nOP hasn't said there any issues apart from being picky", "Okay, I'm gonna be honest, I still think you're the asshole (& also a bit of a nonreliable narrater, if not an outright liar) and I think your eldest was telling the truth when he said you would *not*, in fact, do that for him and his siblings. I'll also note that according to your own writing, you don't deny that to your son, basically admitting that you wouldn't and justifying why it is you're willing to do it for the youngest. Stop spoiling your youngest before you ruin their relationship with your other kids, and also ruin him as a person by letting him think the world resolves around him and there are no consequences to his actions. Apologize to your other kids and actually *work* on your behavior in future. Do better, because this really isn't it.", "Which is why you would be getting an N.T.A.  You would have fed your child before instead of creating discomfort for the birthday celebration. And it sounds like you do give equivalent and equal treatment between your children. The original poster is not showing the same consideration of all their children. There's a major difference between a child with a legit health concern and trying to avoid a tantrum.", "For $75 how long were you expecting to be GONE?", "cool, so again, why even come here to ask if you're the AH in the first place?", "I've never seen that before! Very interesting. I'm in the Midwest, I don't really know if that makes much of a difference but it might.", "My mother came home and raved how good the vegetable quesadilla tasted.", "And you didn\u2019t have a reason because he\u2019s the favourite\n\nEdit: also did you not consider I want to get my own my so I\u2019m gonna wrap mommy round my little finger to be a reason? Come on, you\u2019ve had two kids already", "I have also a really sensity taste and taste even the smallest thing. My SO can never understand this. I also have problems with texture smells and tastes of mosts of foos, it justs want me puke. Having sensory issues really restrict what you can eat and often others think you are just picky, but hey, believe me, i wish i could just eat everything without a care...", "Does your son have ARFID?", "Okay. Ours had like mini tacos on the kids menu and just smaller sizes. Regardless doesn't make mom an ah for making sure he'd have them so not to cause a scene on other kids bd", "What's the point of posting without being honest? Also, you're breaking sub rules by calling me a liar.", "At least three hours", "If you'd read the post you'd see that the person who accused me of being an asshole was my son, not the restaurant. The restaurant and I had no conflict.", "I am also in the Midwest.", "Mexican was our go to during covid.  Probably gained 10 pounds from queso and quesadillas lol.\n\nMexican restaurant by me added cheese fries to their menu after I started ordering it so much.  So yummy.", "Our local Mexican place has a Veggie Quesadilla option. I ordered it and expected it to be just peppers and onions, but it was loaded with stuff - portobello mushrooms, squash, potatoes, etc. It's my new favorite thing.", "What is that?\n\nNevermind, I googled it. He does some of those things, but not all of them. I think it's just a phase he'll outgrow.", "Agree to disagree. If the kid was eating queso order him his own.  It was something to eat.  Maybe not what he wanted but he\u2019s 7.  Time to realize you don\u2019t always get what you want.  Don\u2019t go out of her way to get him a special meal when the days *not* about him.\n\nThis comes from an **extremely** picky eater.  Where most places I get fries or mozzarella sticks.  I never got a special meal.  I always found something I\u2019d eat there.", "Yeah. It actually means MOM has not properly parented her child and allows him to whine and complain so much that it ruins the evening for everybody. That's bad parenting! If he can't behave appropriately, he can sit in the car.", "Sounds like you also need to read the rules, like 1&3.", "Because what you're saying in this comment is a direct opposite to what you wrote in your post. Also, Im not name calling or bullying. You lied. It's in your post and this comment, that's not the same as being name called.", "And you wouldn\u2019t pay that so the non special son can enjoy his birthday without the baby Jesus ruining it?", "So far, most of us think you are.", "Because your son sees that your youngest is being treated with kid gloves and he never got that treatment. I was that golden child growing up, my parents treated me like their baby through college and beyond. It destroyed my relationship with my siblings and now I am NC with my parents. He\u2019s not a baby. He\u2019s 7. He can behave. Make him.", "It's weird how OP nitpicks what rules she does and doesn't see. Kind of like how she sees her situation with her kids. And literally any commentor here saying she's the AH.", "The person I originally responded to asked me a question. Answering questions is not a rule violation. They asked for information. That's not arguing. Nor is it uncivil. It's giving them what they asked for, information. Calling me a liar is specifically cited in the rules as prohibited.", "No, it isn't. Read it again. What my son said and how I feel aren't the same thing. We are two different people. And it doesn't matter that you aren't bullying. It's a rule violation to accuse me of lying. If you think I'm lying, report me to the mods. You aren't supposed to comment calling the people asking for judgement liars. That's very specifically outlined in the rules.", "How does the kid eating Chick Fil A \u201cruin\u201d the birthday? I\u2019d rather make an extra stop than risk the youngest throwing a fit on the siblings birthday.", "Girl, you reread it. That is what you said. Also, I'd be a little more careful about throwing around the rules, you're currently (actually) violating them yourself. Repeatedly. I'm sorry that you can't accept what people are saying to you. Do better.", "Or you could just discipline appropriately", "Quote it then.", "I\u2019d agree, but this isn\u2019t just a random family dinner. If there\u2019s a way a parent knows they can avoid a conflict at a birthday party/celebration of some kind, then they should do it."]}
