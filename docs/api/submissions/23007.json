I have no problem with him, except he works the night shift, so he sleeps during the day. Due to this, he comes over during the night to visit my daughter. This wouldn\u2019t bother me if he respected that everyone else in the house is trying to sleep. Instead, they make no effort to stay quiet. It\u2019s incredibly annoying, and is keeping me and my other children up. My wife says that he should be allowed to come over and that they\u2019re not being that bad, because at least we know where she is and we aren\u2019t worrying about her. I\u2019ve suggested that we tell them to go somewhere else to hang out, but my wife doesn\u2019t like the idea of not knowing where our daughter is, or letting her go out with anyone after dark.

If they can't be quite they need to beat feet.", "NTA. The house is everybody's space, but as the parent, you set the rules. If you tell her \"your bf can come over but only if you guys don't keep everyone else awake\" and she can't fulfill that, then you're totally justified telling her to find somewhere else to hang out.\n\nAs for your wife, well, your daughter is an adult and is preparing to move out. Once that happens, your wife will rarely know where your daughter is. Point this out to her, but be gentle about it. Moms always worry, even when they shouldn't.", "NTA is there another part of the house they can hang out in? Have you talked to your daughter about the noise? \n\nYour daughter is an adult, the logical alternative is for her to stay at the boyfriend\u2019s house if they\u2019re unable to be quiet enough and he has a better set-up.", "Have you actually talked to your daughter about this? Just banning the boyfriend from coming over will definitely cause some strain on everyone\u2019s relationships.\nAs someone who\u2019s worked night shifts, you don\u2019t realize that your \u201cnormal\u201d level of living is actually that loud.", "NTA, they sound disrespectful - which justifies the rule. \n\nBut 8 pm seems a little early, imo.  It's not even dark out at 8 pm in July. 10 pm or whatever time you regularly go to bed sounds more likely to be an acceptable compromise. \n\nAs all of us parents know, the second half of the rule is being able to enforce it. Oh, maybe that's why you're saying 8 pm?\n\nGood luck. NTA.\n\nEdit: to address your wife's concerns, that sounds like an enabler's excuse to justify poor choices for the kids: buying them alcohol to drink at home, allowing sex in the house so that you know where it's happening.  All of it is enabling reasons to justify a poor choice when there is no guarantee that these things would happen if your wife didn't enable it. When I was a teen and young adult, I always loved these parents that made rebellious behavior easier to commit.  As a parent, I totally disagree with it. Does your daughter cave to peer pressure easily? Does your daughter know how to conduct herself in some risky situations? If not, start talking to her.", "NTA. I would have a talk with your daughter if you haven\u2019t already about the noise disrupting the rest of the family\u2019s sleep, I\u2019ll give her the benefit of doubt that she\u2019s just not very aware. However the BF is a guest and he should be much more respectful when visiting. He knows he\u2019s coming over late when the rest of the household is settling down. If the two of them can\u2019t keep it down, go ahead a set a curfew. 8pm may be early but maybe they need that strictness to know how impacting their behavior has been", "NTA. It's time to be proactive and find a middle ground that won't have your wife fretting. If you're someplace where nothing is open after 9, are you in a rural area? Do you have a yard? Can you banish them to a shed converted to a living room by adding an old couch and running out an extension cord? Do you have a garage you can soundproof with old mattresses and order them to use? \n\nIf none of the above, can you charge your eldest rent if they can't keep it down? Can you keep the router in your room and turn off the wifi any time they wake you up? \n\nCome on Reddit: What suggestions do you have for how to provide consequences without driving DD into the night?", "NTA", "They need to go if they can\u2019t respect that others have work and school.", "NTA\n\nIf they can't keep the noise down then he doesn't get to come over at that time.\n\nPerhaps your daughter should be going to his place to see him... but I bet you they are loud there too and his parents don't want visitors that late either.", "Nta. You deserve sleep and so do your other children.", "NTA. She's 20, she's an adult, she can go outside at night. She wants to have a boyfriend who works night shift then she has to deal with the side effects that come with it. Other people live in the house and no everyone is able to sleep through loud noises like your wife can. If you and your other children are struggling to sleep then the boyfriend shouldn't come over. Your wife saying \"oh come on, they're not being that loud\" doesn't suddenly tell your brain and your other children's brains \"oh it is quiet! I can suddenly sleep!\" No that isn't how shit works, if the brain thinks it's too loud its gonna stay awake. So sorry to your wife who can handle it but guess what, other people have to sleep to. Your daughter should be more respectful of the rest of the family especially since you let her stay with you at age 20. If she doesn't want to deal with needing to respect the other people she lives with then she should move out so she can have her own rules.", "NTA she's 20, time to cut the cord. If your sole complaint is the noise being made during normal sleeping hours for your household tell them to go hang out at his place or wherever but not to bug everyone else. If your daughter is moving out soon anyways your wife needs to come to grips with the idea that she's about to be out of the nest anyways. She's almost old enough to go to clubs.", "YTA simply because this needs to be a joint decision with your wife - you can't make it unilaterally.", "YTA - \n\nAre they REALLY being that disruptive or - considering all this talk about \u201cknowing\u201d where your daughter is - does it make you uncomfortable because you\u2019re not awake to \u201csupervise\u201d.\n\nYour daughter is an adult there can be reasonable noise levels that can be respected because it\u2019s late.\n\nAlso work with your wife not over her.", "YTA.  \n\n1.  Your wife has already said something about this.  \n2.  Your daughter is 20?  When are you going to start trusting her judgment?\n3.  The proper way to parent when two people don't agree is to come to a decision on what you can agree with.  It's clear you can't, which is sad because you've got three kids and another five years to go before the youngest moves out, hopefully.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
