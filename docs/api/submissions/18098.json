We've had our ups and downs but overall we have a great relationship, and I definitely see a future together! We really love and respect each other and connect well! But the thing is we come from different backgrounds. I come from a Muslim Background (I'm not 'that' religious tho) and she is White. However, we have still made it work and our similarities are much more than our differences.\r  \n\r  \nNow my gf does like wearing a bit short clothing when out and about, which used to bother me at first and made me uncomfortable and we did have a few minor fights over it, but eventually I came to terms with it.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, recently an embarrassing situation happened. There was a pool party at my cousin's house, and my parents were there too. I had recently introduced my gf to my parents as well, so this was a good time for to meet family and relatives. I specifically told her to please pack something more on the modest side, as my family would be there (and most women usually don't wear such revealing stuff in our culture). She didn't give much of a response and just nodded.\r  \n\r  \nBut what did I see in the pool? Her wearing a two piece bikini (with kinda cheeky bottoms too)! Even one piece would've been more better, but nah she went all in this time! She was probably the one the dressed most immodestly.\r  \n\r  \nNo one said anything but afterwards, I was so embarrassed I couldn't show my face to my parents and all.\r  \n\r  \nI did talk to her about it and scolded her a bit, and she told me \"She can wear whatever the hell she wants, whenever she wants.\"\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't say anything afterwards. We've been quiet to each other for a while but slowly making up now.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684963137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qy21v/aita_for_not_letting_my_girlfriend_wear_a_bikini/", "score": 3402, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We've had our ups and downs but overall we have a great relationship, and I definitely see a future together! We really love and respect each other and connect well! But the thing is we come from different backgrounds. I come from a Muslim Background (I'm not 'that' religious tho) and she is White. However, we have still made it work and our similarities are much more than our differences.\r  \n\r  \nNow my gf does like wearing a bit short clothing when out and about, which used to bother me at first and made me uncomfortable and we did have a few minor fights over it, but eventually I came to terms with it.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, recently an embarrassing situation happened. There was a pool party at my cousin's house, and my parents were there too. I had recently introduced my gf to my parents as well, so this was a good time for to meet family and relatives. I specifically told her to please pack something more on the modest side, as my family would be there (and most women usually don't wear such revealing stuff in our culture). She didn't give much of a response and just nodded.\r  \n\r  \nBut what did I see in the pool? Her wearing a two piece bikini (with kinda cheeky bottoms too)! Even one piece would've been more better, but nah she went all in this time! She was probably the one the dressed most immodestly.\r  \n\r  \nNo one said anything but afterwards, I was so embarrassed I couldn't show my face to my parents and all.\r  \n\r  \nI did talk to her about it and scolded her a bit, and she told me \"She can wear whatever the hell she wants, whenever she wants.\"\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't say anything afterwards. We've been quiet to each other for a while but slowly making up now.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is an argument you have had previously and have supposedly learned that you cannot dictate her style chices, and then you scold her like a child! \n\nThat being said, dressing for a conservative families pool party seems like it would be an obvious occasion to dress more modestly. You have been dating for 2 years..... does she have so many bathing suits that you had no idea what her options were?!

Maybe a compromise on a new bathing suit could have been made and you then showing all the appreciation in the world for your very understanding girlfriend.", "NAH, but \n\nJust as you have a right to your cultural norms, so does she.

This will continue to come up until she either changes her mind or you do.", "Yes, YTA because you're trying to control how she dresses. Just break up with her and go out with someone whose views match yours. You're like Mahmoud in 90 day fianc\u00e9, you simply should not be with this person. You shouldn't even ascribe it to Islam as there are Muslims who don't act this way. It's just your own personal values. Your request is unreasonable, change relationships.", "Ahhhh, you had me all the way until you scolded her. She\u2019s not a child. \n\nSo ESH. \nDon\u2019t scold, she\u2019s an adult and can do as she pleases. \nAnd it sounds like your a bit more of a believer than you think you are. \n\nShe is an AH, because if she sees a future with you, in relationships there are certain things you have to meet in the middle on. So if she respected you and your family, with your religious views she should have dressed a bit more modestly. YES she is entitled to wear what she pleases, but this is more of a respect thing and is the hill you really wanna die on kinda situation for her. I personally, in a relationship I respected and see a future with would eat that one and just of dressed modestly. I equate it to let\u2019s saying having older fashion family members, and even if you swear regularly\u2026 hold your tongue a bit while your with them to just not cause a scene. Because at that point she is creating a gap between you and your family. She wants to be \u201cin the fold\u201d she at least needs to show some respect to their views. If not she is making the precedent that they will cut you off, and you have to choose between her and them.

According to OP he has come to accept the way his gf dresses but it seems to me that he has not. He was embarrassed for her wearing a swim suit that she was comfortable in.

He flat out told me he did not care what I wore and actually preferred I wore less. BUT it's his family and I didn't want them to see me as anything inappropriate to be around. I typically wore modest clothing around them and changed in the car. I considered meeting his family to be like a job interview.  My goal was to simply be someone they could respect. Over time I could slowly be myself, but I understood the cultural background and certainly didn't want to offend anyone in their own home. I will agree that perhaps at least a one piece would have been appropriate ONLY because this was not in a public setting or her private place. It was a home in a family that practices certain aspects. If I visited my Catholic, Mormon, or other friends I typically followed along with their home guidelines because it was their place. I certainly never had to pray before dinner with them, but I'd usually wait until their done to eat, I generally wore clothing that wasn't offensive, etc. However if I met them in a public setting then I didn't do jack shit to follow along, and i never had an issue.

My hope is that you used an incorrect word, because \"scolding\" a partner is abuse. The only time it's mildly acceptable is if someone's life was in danger. So I'm not on your side on this one. You owe her an apology. You have 2 options. You can politely and respectfully have an open conversation about guidelines with your family. Absolutely no where else.

If he didn't give a shit whether they liked her he probably wouldn't want to introduce her in the first place, and even if he did, wouldn't give a crap if they thought badly of her. \n\nSince they've been together for quite a while I think he's justified thinking that she understands what he means when he made the request for this occasion. It's not that they've been together for two months, in which case I'd say then he's absolutely being unfair as in that case she's still getting used to his culture, what she needs to compromise on and if she's happy with those compromises. \n\nWhich is why all in all I genuinely think it's either an NAH or if not, an ESH situation because it's either:\n\n1 - *Everyone is being mean*: he's an AH for scolding her because she's not a child and he doesn't own her but by that argument as she's an adult with her own autonomy she's an AH for not being considerate regarding his family's culture. \n\nOr \n\n2 - *Everyone has the right to stand by their beliefs*: it is right for her to feel she can wear wth she wants in line with her beliefs and therefore if is equally fair for OP to feel upset in line with his cultural boundaries and therefore they both have the right to be mad at each other.", "You are not all Muslims babe.... like literally they all practice their religion different just like everyone from every religion.", "If she's a guest at their house, following their rules is a reasonable expectation.", "If it had been at a public pool or beach, absolutely.

Yeah she can wear whatever she wants, and OP can\u2019t change that. But saying that he\u2019s oppressing her when he made a relatively reasonable request is ridiculous.

Completely dismissing someone else\u2019s views in their own household is kind of disrespectful, and she should\u2019ve at the very least asked OP to call them on speakerphone to see if it would be an issue.

Yea, thats a problem and out of line. Asking someone to dress a bit modestly for a family event? Nope. \n\nHowever, I ALSO don\u2019t think refusing to make that adjustment makes her TA. \n\nThe issue is really that OP tried to communicate before the event, his GF left him to assume it was fine, and then did the opposite to make a point. So, of course he is surprised and hurt. If that conversation had happened beforehand, it would have been different. \n\nI have no way to know if the bathing suit was a modest 2 piece or an I\u2019m-sitting-by-a-pool-in-Vegas style bikini, but regardless of my partner\u2019s religion or parents, I just always bias towards a one piece in family pool settings. And if I knew it was something my partner was sensitive to and I planned to present in a way that was the opposite of what they\u2019d indicated would be most appropriate in the setting, than I\u2019d let them know beforehand, let them know why, and then they could digest it. \n\nSo - NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s fine and fair if modesty at family events is a deal breaker for either OP or his GF. That happens. But, it should be a 2 way conversation. Not a situation where someone tries to communicate, the other doesn\u2019t engage and so the assumption is they are fine with it, and then \u201csurprise!\u201d.\n\nI\u2019d be embarrassed if my partner showed up to a work event in an old tee shirt and shorts. OP is embarrassed because his GF showed up dressed in a way that wasn\u2019t appropriate for the circumstance, and even if the bounds of what is appropriate may be more narrow than what others consider modest, feeling upset is ok. \n\nI think people get wrapped up in the idea of religious oppression, but I think it\u2019s totally fine for OP to say before a family pool party, hey my family is really conservative and it\u2019s a pool party, would you feel ok wearing a one piece? And GF can say yes or no, and go from there.\n\nWhat\u2019s hard to tell though is whether the request is really an isolated request. The fact skirts were an issue earlier suggest that maybe this is a conversation they\u2019ve had a lot, and this was a final straw for the GF. If that\u2019s the case then sure maybe OP is TA in a bigger way, but just going off this specific example, I think NTA. \n\nBeing embarrassed someone shows up dressed outside of an occasion you prepped them for and then that the person did it to make a point - feels like a relatively normal reaction to me, regardless of whether it\u2019s tied to culture, religion, or context. \n\nBut - OP - you do need to come to terms with what and how your girlfriend likes to wear.
