We've had our ups and downs but overall we have a great relationship, and I definitely see a future together! We really love and respect each other and connect well! But the thing is we come from different backgrounds. I come from a Muslim Background (I'm not 'that' religious tho) and she is White. However, we have still made it work and our similarities are much more than our differences.\r  \n\r  \nNow my gf does like wearing a bit short clothing when out and about, which used to bother me at first and made me uncomfortable and we did have a few minor fights over it, but eventually I came to terms with it.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, recently an embarrassing situation happened. There was a pool party at my cousin's house, and my parents were there too. I had recently introduced my gf to my parents as well, so this was a good time for to meet family and relatives. I specifically told her to please pack something more on the modest side, as my family would be there (and most women usually don't wear such revealing stuff in our culture). She didn't give much of a response and just nodded.\r  \n\r  \nBut what did I see in the pool? Her wearing a two piece bikini (with kinda cheeky bottoms too)! Even one piece would've been more better, but nah she went all in this time! She was probably the one the dressed most immodestly.\r  \n\r  \nNo one said anything but afterwards, I was so embarrassed I couldn't show my face to my parents and all.\r  \n\r  \nI did talk to her about it and scolded her a bit, and she told me \"She can wear whatever the hell she wants, whenever she wants.\"\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't say anything afterwards. We've been quiet to each other for a while but slowly making up now.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684963137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qy21v/aita_for_not_letting_my_girlfriend_wear_a_bikini/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Were you diplomatic with \"hey some of my family is pretty conservative, would you mind wearing a one-piece? I can take you shopping for one if you like\" or did you just lay down the law?\n\n7. Mitigating factor- she may have deliberately worn the skimpiest thing she owned because you asked her to comply with a misogynistic aspect of your culture and she gives zero f*cks about what you, or your kin, think of her in this regard.

I don\u2019t think your girlfriend was wrong to want to wear a bikini, either, but the fact that she knew how you felt and did it anyway shows that she doesn\u2019t have much respect for you or your family. Honestly there\u2019s nothing wrong with you two having cultural differences, the hard part is figuring out how to overcome them and work together.

You told her what would be socially acceptable, and she decided that it wasnt important.", "YTA", "I'm going to go YTA. You chose to date this person. Nobody else in your family complained about her clothing. Your culture dictates how *you* should dress, not her.

We live in Europe and he knows better than telling me what to wear. However, it has been discussed and agreed together that i am to cover up more when we visit his family back home, especially the eldest members who are religious. Does that make me feel like an oppressed woman to do so? Absolutely not. \n\nIt's about showing respect. If i don't feel like/agree with covering up, then i won't go.

If you can't show your face to your parents because she wore a bikini, it's not going to get any better. No judgment about anyone's faith, but ~~ESH,~~  NTA, mainly because this dynamic of you feeling the need to police her around your family and her not caring how it affects your relationship with your family doesn't seem like two people who are considerate of each other.

We've had our ups and downs but overall we have a great relationship, and I definitely see a future together! We really love and respect each other and connect well! But the thing is we come from different backgrounds. I come from a Muslim Background (I'm not 'that' religious tho) and she is White. However, we have still made it work and our similarities are much more than our differences.\r  \n\r  \nNow my gf does like wearing a bit short clothing when out and about, which used to bother me at first and made me uncomfortable and we did have a few minor fights over it, but eventually I came to terms with it.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, recently an embarrassing situation happened. There was a pool party at my cousin's house, and my parents were there too. I had recently introduced my gf to my parents as well, so this was a good time for to meet family and relatives. I specifically told her to please pack something more on the modest side, as my family would be there (and most women usually don't wear such revealing stuff in our culture). She didn't give much of a response and just nodded.\r  \n\r  \nBut what did I see in the pool? Her wearing a two piece bikini (with kinda cheeky bottoms too)! Even one piece would've been more better, but nah she went all in this time! She was probably the one the dressed most immodestly.\r  \n\r  \nNo one said anything but afterwards, I was so embarrassed I couldn't show my face to my parents and all.\r  \n\r  \nI did talk to her about it and scolded her a bit, and she told me \"She can wear whatever the hell she wants, whenever she wants.\"\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't say anything afterwards. We've been quiet to each other for a while but slowly making up now.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is an argument you have had previously and have supposedly learned that you cannot dictate her style chices, and then you scold her like a child! \n\nThat being said, dressing for a conservative families pool party seems like it would be an obvious occasion to dress more modestly.

Maybe a compromise on a new bathing suit could have been made and you then showing all the appreciation in the world for your very understanding girlfriend.", "NAH, but \n\nJust as you have a right to your cultural norms, so does she.

This will continue to come up until she either changes her mind or you do.", "Yes, YTA because you're trying to control how she dresses. Just break up with her and go out with someone whose views match yours. You're like Mahmoud in 90 day fianc\u00e9, you simply should not be with this person. You shouldn't even ascribe it to Islam as there are Muslims who don't act this way. It's just your own personal values. Your request is unreasonable, change relationships.", "Ahhhh, you had me all the way until you scolded her. She\u2019s not a child. \n\nSo ESH. \nDon\u2019t scold, she\u2019s an adult and can do as she pleases. \nAnd it sounds like your a bit more of a believer than you think you are. \n\nShe is an AH, because if she sees a future with you, in relationships there are certain things you have to meet in the middle on. So if she respected you and your family, with your religious views she should have dressed a bit more modestly. YES she is entitled to wear what she pleases, but this is more of a respect thing and is the hill you really wanna die on kinda situation for her. I personally, in a relationship I respected and see a future with would eat that one and just of dressed modestly. I equate it to let\u2019s saying having older fashion family members, and even if you swear regularly\u2026 hold your tongue a bit while your with them to just not cause a scene. Because at that point she is creating a gap between you and your family. She wants to be \u201cin the fold\u201d she at least needs to show some respect to their views. If not she is making the precedent that they will cut you off, and you have to choose between her and them.

He flat out told me he did not care what I wore and actually preferred I wore less. BUT it's his family and I didn't want them to see me as anything inappropriate to be around. I typically wore modest clothing around them and changed in the car. I considered meeting his family to be like a job interview.  My goal was to simply be someone they could respect. Over time I could slowly be myself, but I understood the cultural background and certainly didn't want to offend anyone in their own home. I will agree that perhaps at least a one piece would have been appropriate ONLY because this was not in a public setting or her private place. It was a home in a family that practices certain aspects. If I visited my Catholic, Mormon, or other friends I typically followed along with their home guidelines because it was their place. I certainly never had to pray before dinner with them, but I'd usually wait until their done to eat, I generally wore clothing that wasn't offensive, etc. However if I met them in a public setting then I didn't do jack shit to follow along, and i never had an issue.

You owe her an apology. You have 2 options. You can politely and respectfully have an open conversation about guidelines with your family. Absolutely no where else.
