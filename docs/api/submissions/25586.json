So that dude didn't want his daughter to suffer the company of overactive children, but throwing you under the bus was fine?

Airline policy should be to seat families with small children together at the time of boarding, full stop. If someone has to be moved, let it be on the \\*airlines\\* head, not the parent.    \nAnd, once again in aita, people are glossing over the reality that **even when they BOOK IN ADVANCE**, families may not be able to find seats together, or may have their seats changed by the airline, or any one of a number of things that may have them asking for the kindness of strangers. It's not always a planning issue.   \n\n\nIt doesn't excuse them being asshats when someone says \"no\"... but I'm also curious why it's so hard for people to just be kind?", "Yes, you are never the AH for using the actual seat you spent your own money for.
