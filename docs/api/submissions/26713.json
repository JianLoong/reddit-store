I\u2019ve also shared beds with family members throughout my life. \n\nBut, if your daughter was uncomfortable, you shouldn\u2019t push her to do something she doesn\u2019t want to and it\u2019s inappropriate for adults to be asking an 8 year old questions like that. At the end of the day, it was your choice to get the hotel room and they should recognize that rather than guilting a child.\n\nTo play devil\u2019s advocate a little bit, I can see why some family members may feel sensitive about it. If everyone else stayed at the house and all of their kids shared beds, they may have taken it as you and your child being \u201ctoo good\u201d for that.

I do not share a single bathroom 7 other people. I don't care that they think it's weird, my comfort matters.", "NAH it honestly is a little weird. Kids share beds on vacations all the time, little girls love having sleepovers with their friends & cousins. It\u2019s a great cousin bonding time to stay up late giggling in the dark telling silly stories, etc. Also at 8 years old, she could just sleep on a cushion on the floor, or sleeping bag on the floor in your room or with her cousins. That\u2019s how we all slumber parties back in the day. So, it does make her pretty spoiled and inflexible. I can see how your in-laws were offended.

You can't stop people from talking.\n\nI obviously don't know your kid but one thing to consider is whether this intransigence is a pattern.  We all have weird little habits but you need to ask yourself if this is just one thing or one of many.  Don't raise her to be unable to adapt.  It'll hurt her.

You did the right thing and it\u2019s unfortunate that they couldn\u2019t understand and made this the daily discussion that also caused you and your daughter to feel uncomfortable for no reason whatsoever. Interesting that they couldn\u2019t even fathom how anxious and upset they were making her feel about a perfectly acceptable reason for not wanting to share a sleeping space with them just because they forced their children to do so.

I don\u2019t see what business the others  had for interfering with your perfectly reasonable decision.  No, not all girls share beds.  I have three girls and they have never shared a bed.

Whether or not someone finds this normal I think depends on if they grew up with sisters or close girl cousins.

And now as an adult I hate both of those things. I'll share a bed with a friend if there's no other option, like a couple of years ago I tagged along with a friend to her cousin's wedding not knowing what the accommodations were because her aunt rented out a charming little inn... turns out my friend and i were to share a full size bed and had a shared bathroom with her cousins.  It wasn't until the aunt saw my reaction (nothing crazy, more like an involuntary gasp) when we walked into the room that she realized maybe not everyone is totally down for this and some heads up at least would have been nice. I stayed both nights and didn't say anything because she was being super nice to provide so much for me that weekend. But I got very little sleep that weekend and generally hated being in the hotel.

Seeing as how they're his family, I would have expected him to intervene and ask them to drop it.\n\nAnd if your answer is something along the lines of, \"He didn't want to take sides,\" then you should know that his *not* saying something when everyone is hassling you/your daughter over this decision *is* him taking a side.", "NTA - Nothing weird about it.  Not sure why the family turned it into a weird thing.  Sleep is important.  Daughter has always slept alone and she'll sleep better keeping to her normal routine.  My son also had major sleep issues as a kid and when he was little it turned into a battle to have Grandma & Grandpa use his bed while he slept with us and then none of us slept well or enjoyed our time together.  So we made other arrangements that didn't involve him having to give up his bed several times a year.  As long as you weren't asking them to do something different (pay for the hotel, give up one of their rooms, etc.) then they get no say in the matter.  Does it mean 8-year old missed out on late night cousin shenanigans?  Yes, but that's the trade off and there's nothing wrong with that.  And her not wanting to share a better has nothing to do with her feelings about her cousins, it's all about her sleep preferences.", "NTA. What is up with the family tho. Why is it a big deal?", "FWIW i do think that sharing a bed is very normal, and if I had to guess, you/your daughter are in the minority for never having shared a bed with anyone else. I have dozens of times when visiting friends. That being said, if she doesn\u2019t want to, they shouldn\u2019t have pushed and made her feel bad about it. NTA", "NTA. You were just respecting your daughter's wishes. You are a good parent. They are arrogant bullies.", "ESH. This would have been easily solved with a sleeping bag, air mattress or other makeshift bed. The ridicule is uncalled for, but you invited it. In the future make sure to better plan ahead.", "You should have stayed at the house. If necessary, bring something for your daughter to sleep on in your room: cot, air mattress, foam pad w sleeping bag, whatever. It is very normal for girl cousins to share a bed when together with family, but sleeping in your room would have been a fair compromise.", "ESH\n\nYour daughter didn't want to share a bed and you weren't going to force her; perfectly reasonable. But it sounds like part of the trip was to have your family all there, together and your rigidity sort of ruined that. Surely there was another solution that didn't involve a hotel.\n\nIt's also not weird to share a bed with a family member or friend, regardless of your personal experience. And letting the whims of an 8-year-old change your plans like this is impractical; sometimes kids have to do things they aren't thrilled with at first and sharing a bed for a night or two wouldn't have hurt her. But it sounds like you made a decision and the way your in-laws reacted was a bit pushy and manipulative.", "Gonna go against the consensus with a soft YTA.  \n\nEveryone has things they are uncomfortable with because they've never tried it before, *especially* children.  It is parents' job to force reasonable excursions from their \"comfort zone\". This is how kids grow up not to be entitled selfish adults.  Do you act the same regarding food?  If Cass was \"uncomfortable\" eating anything other than chicken nuggets and fries, would you let her eat only that until she's an adult?  \n\nAs long as it's something reasonable (and sharing a bed with another similar age child is absolutely reasonable), you should have had your child do it.  It may take some convincing, and encouragement, or god forbid, parenting on your part, rather than just cave into her fears at best, and entitlement at worst.  It's not like she needed to share with 40-yo uncle Steve, it sounds like she would have shared with a girl close to her age.\n\nFurthermore, your comments seem to be sexualizing completely normal children's socialization.  Was I uncomfortable changing or showering with the other kids in gym class?  Yes.  Did I get over it?  Yes.  As an adult man, I've had to share a bed in a hotel room because they didn't have any more double rooms, and screw paying another $150 for my own room.  We each slept on our own side, one with the sheets, the other with the duvet -- no need to spoon or cuddle.  And I am too damn old to sleep on the floor.  The primary use of a bed is for sleeping, and you're weirdly sexualizing it.  \n\nNonetheless, it's your prerogative to spend money on a hotel room so your kid doesn't have to grow as a person.  But your family isn't wrong, you are over-sensitive about this.", "Soft YTA. Great job on honoring your daughters bodily autonomy, but you lost parenting points when you threw her under the bus for it. Next time, instead of blaming your daughter when giving the reason you\u2019re staying elsewhere, tell everyone you and your spouse wanted to do it for your own privacy.\n\nAlso I feel like there could have been a compromise solution in between sharing a bed and a hotel. Could she have slept on the couch or on a small air mattress literally anywhere in the house. It does radically change the family dynamic when one family is away. I always enjoyed all of the extended family crew walking up and eating breakfast together. Hanging out until bedtime, etc\u2026 there is value is staying under one roof if everyone generally gets along.", "Would she have been willing to sleep on top of a bunch of blankets on a sofa, a couch, or the floor? Maybe even make a kid fort or two out of sheets and/or couch pillows? It\u2019d be like camping but inside. Really fun, memorable options.", "NTA but it is weird (jumping straight to hotel, and this hangup you have about sharing beds as a kid). It sounds like you're causing your kid to have weird boundaries just like you do. Not optimal, but if you want to raise your kid in this way that's up to you.  Sleeping bags and floors exist, and are handy in these situations.\n\nThat said, the family should not be bullying or making fun of your kid under any circumstance. So they are being total assholes in that respect. F them for that.", "OP, this is some first rate parenting on your part.", "NTA. I don't see the problem with you getting a hotel. Everyone else should be kind of happy because there is more room for the rest and also less work. \n\n>I didn\u2019t change around other girls either except in gym class, where I\u2019d generally change in the restroom because it felt really inappropriate. \n\nBut I must admit I find this really weird. When I was a kid we had swimming lessons and we changed clothes together in one big room even there, just divided by gender. And of course the showers were also in one big room. The public bath still has only one big shower room and while some showers (though not all) have side walls, there are no doors. So it is common for women seeing each other naked there. I mean you don't have to get rid of your bathing clothes while showering, but many women do it. I really don't see why that is \"inappropriate\"? Maybe it is a cultural difference? You were raised very prude? Where I live nude beaches exist where the whole family goes swimming and also saunas with men and women both getting completely naked together are the norm and everywhere. It might not be everyone's thing, but if someone likes it, it is fine. Girls changing in gym classes in one big room, even during swimming classes, is definitive totally the norm and no one finds that inappropriate. If a girl would have acted like you when I was in school, likely some other girls would have made fun of her for being so prude and shy. \n\n>Even as a little kid, I\u2019d never have shared a bed either.\n\nA lot of young girls like having sleepovers with friends. I don't know how big the beds are, but if there is room enough most girls would find it fun. \n\nMaybe your daughter picked up that strong sense of body shame from you.", "YTA. Yes, it did hurt feelings.", "You free up space for others without adding any expense to anyone other than yourselves.  I really can't understand their issue with all of this.  Jealousy because your daughter doesn't HAVE to share space and everyone else does?  That the annoyance and lack of comfort needs to be equally shared or else it's unfair?  \n\nAs far as it goes, just because she might be comfortable sharing bedding arrangements with some people... friends or other relatives, there's nothing saying she needs to exhibit the same comfort level with THESE particular family members. \n\nBest I can figure, someone is taking this as a personal slight and has turned it into a bigger issue than it needs to be.  \"Are you insinuating that my daughter smells bad or something and that's why your kid doesn't want to share a bed with her???\"  Some people think it's always all about them after all.  So now, not only have you not just attempted to arrange solo bedding for Cass, you went all out and moved your entire family to an exterior property.  Took the minor unintended insult and cranked it up to 11.  Maybe someone commented on something in the past.  Maybe someone had lice in the past.  Someone used to wet the bed or got sick, or who the hell knows.  Some lingering child drama from the distant past that a parent has held onto for far to long, and this was the event that sparked that fire again.  \n\nThat's just my guess.  In any event, none of it makes you the asshole. Enjoy your private space.  NTA.", "Yeah your kid is weird and she gets it from you. Changed in restroom, please. Americans are freaks.", "Slight ESH. \n\nThe inlaws bevause they insisted too much, \n\nYou because youve put a sexual spin on something that's totally not (your experience of only sharing a bed romantically), \n\nYou and your husband straight away getting a hotel room instead of finding a different solution in the house.

Everyone should have shrugged it off, with the goal of not ruining the holiday with ill-feeling. It seems unlikely that another solution couldn\u2019t have been found- a lot of rigid thinking happening here. \n\nSeparately, I will also add that where we live my 8yo would have had a pretty brutal next few years of being excluded from sleepovers, holiday weekend invitations and parties with her little friends if she had such a strong aversion to sleeping in close proximity to other kids. It may be that although you, the parent, haven\u2019t had those experiences, it is something worth considering getting her used to?

It\u2019s common for kids to be nervous to see their cousins but become super close once they\u2019re actually interacting again.

The way it worked out they got neither so they were partly slighted. Partly jealous. Overall not buying that a parent is really opting out because of the child\u2019s preference.

My little sisters would change in front of us until they turned a certain age and then they stopped because they didn't want to anymore and that was fine.

But I guess being antagonistic was a better use of their time.", "Shot in the dark: They said that OOP would be spending money they didnt have to. Then if they went through with it, the other kids might get the idea that they really dont have to share a bed with others and now demand their own too.

It would be embarrassing to admit that their hospitality is inadequate.  Like not only is it \"not good enough\" for OP's family, but it raises the question of whether the cousins who were staying there, were being imposed on by having to double up.

The fact that the changing thing is even brought up makes me wonder if OP/the kid would have even been comfortable sharing a room with a cousin.

It was 100% my decision. However, when my parents told the extended family, they said that they feel I would do better by taking a gap year, prepare more to get a better college. Take took the heat for this from few of the family members. One of the aunts called me up as said that I should let her know if mom is putting pressure on me to take the gap year and she will fight her for me. That's when I knew what was happening and told her that it was 100% my decision to take the gap year. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHaving said that, in the culture that I come from, it's very common to share a room/bed with your parents/siblings/cousins depending on the circumstances and age. \nWe also have the concept of communal sleeping where all the females sleep in one room and all the males sleep in another. Specially when there is a large family gathering and the space is short.\n\nThis mostly also means that sometimes if it's possible, all the cousins bunk together, or it's just the kids who share the room while the adults get a room per couple. \n\nReally depends on how much space you have. \n\nIt's also seen as a bonding moment between the siblings/cousins.

I get the feeling that OP is from a slightly different set of customs or a different culture even, and took the first opportunity to nope out of something.", "I am surprised I had to scroll this far to find someone else who agrees OP should have left the daughter out of it and covered for them!", "If there only were some makeshift solutions, like air mattrasses or camping beds, so the little cousin could sleep there and the daughter could keep her own bed to herself... sigh...", "Sure, that is a very good reason to not want to share beds. But OP's daughter has never done it before and we don't know if any cousin is difficult to share a bed with.", "OMG!  I hope you don\u2019t have children.  \u201cLet\u2019s just force them into uncomfortable things\u201d.  Hope you\u2019re not one of the I\u2019m going to beat you to toughen you up for life!", ">manipulation, passive aggression and guilt.  \n>  \n>... \u201cWhy does this make you uncomfortable? Don\u2019t you want to spend time with your cousins?\u201d\n\nUGH. Was a whole generation like that?\n\n\"Why aren't you eating your hot prune and mayonnaise pudding your grandmother cooked for dessert? Don't you love your grandmother?", "I understand what you're saying, but I genuinely think OP felt safe in being honest with them and had very rose tinted glasses on when it came to who she was dealing with. People's masks don't usually slip until you go against the grain and OP found out the hard way. I'm willing to bet from now on, she won't be as trusting with them.", "Fuck that. The fact that Cass is uncomfortable with sharing a bed should not be a problem for any reasonable person. Cass's stance is not directed at anyone, it's not calling anyone out, and should not be considered controversial. If an adult was offered to share a bed and said \"I prefer having my own bed, so I'll book myself another room.\" that would be completely fine, so why is it that when it's a child, you think it's something that needs to be rugswept?", "I think it\u2019s normal for cousins to sometimes share beds at that age, but I also think it\u2019s normal for anyone, including kids, to not want to share a bed/have their own space.", "I'm firmly team OP, but I suspect the in-laws had it in their heads that this would be a chance for a cute sleepover party where the kids could play and stay up late and watch TV together or something.  So they saw it as OP causing his daughter to miss out on a fun opportunity because of his own \"weird hangups.\"\n\nFrankly, as someone with not those hangups, I just don't sleep well in a bed with other people.  And if I'd been in his daughter's shoes the entire trip would've been miserable because I'd be exhausted.", "You reddit folks never disappoint lol..", "Yeah, OP did the right thing here but I'm not sure this is sustainable in the long-term. It's generally expected to share beds at an overnight sports tournament or school trip, for example. But then again, the kid is only 8. She might just grow out of it.", "I\u2019m not trying to be argumentative, but I would like to issue a gentle reminder that some of us were molested by family members, and have pretty good reasons for not being okay with our kids just piling in with everyone else. I personally would rather my kids remain safe, and not have to live with the same trauma and ptsd that I deal with, than have those few extra hours of bonding time. Again, I hope I\u2019m not coming off rude, I just wanted to offer a slightly different perspective.", "Is it? I started sleeping over friend\u2019s houses in kindergarten, and we had sleepovers pretty often. I grew up in the 90\u2019s though, so maybe things were different then.", "Why were you downvoted for this very reasonable comment?", "The discussion would help both Cass and the parents to understand and process this strong aversion.  The intensity of the reaction makes me think that is is more than simply not wanting to share a bed, either a fear of something she does in bed or what another might do to her in bed.  If there really is no reason at all, there may be issues that need to be addressed.", "I was surprised to have to hunt to find a comment on this! I also work with kids and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if kid just read her moms reaction.", "You\u2019d not share a bed at any of those usually. A room, often, but not a bed.", "They said the house was packed already. \n\n\nWe have opted out in the same manner. Our child is early elementary aged, and is not on board with the concept of a sleep over. We've tried. So all things being equal, my husband and I have no desire to be packed in like sardines (hubs is also an introvert who requires recharge time. If kiddo isn't on board with the idea either, why not a hotel? A private space to retreat to and recharge, you have your own bathroom, and a bed for yourself. \n\n\nWe don't do it to be rude, but we like the ability to feel more in control of our accomodations and privacy. We're happy to be back to where we need to be on time.", "Sounds like OP is super weird about sharing beds too and would have booked two hotel rooms if they didn't have any with separate beds", "I mean it is the norm I\u2019m pretty sure. They are totally entitled to not want to but every person I\u2019ve ever met friends or family have shared a bed with a friend before. In fact I shared with my cousin recently on her bachelorette trip and I\u2019m 24 \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Surely cheaper (both dollars and emotions) to buy a <$100 air mattress than go straight to a hotel room?", "I\u2019m really sorry that happened to you but having a sleepover with there fellow kid cousins isn\u2019t like there ring left with strangers", "Ultimately, it falls on your husband to explain to his family. You did what you thought best for the situation even if it came across as offensive to your in laws. By your description they do seem like nice people so I'm sure they'll get over it soon enough. \n\nAs an adult if I had to share, I'd go to a hotel, but for the kids I would think it would have been an adventure. A similar thing happened to us one holiday with friends. Other friends visited for the day, when it was time to leave we realised it was too late for them to travel home so we gave the boys room to the adults, pulled out an air mattress and made all the boys sleep on there in the lounge area and the girls ended up sleeping with their parents. Let me tell you, it's 3 years later and the kids still talk about how much fun they had. \n\nI'm worried you may be projecting some trauma, or your own views on your child though. Children are normally very easy going and adapt quickly to any situation. Maybe you could organise a sleep over for all the girl cousins at your house. Put blankets and pillows on the floor in the loungeroom or bedroom and let them all sleep there. Your daughter, being in her home environment may realise that it's not a big deal sharing and may even be fun!!", "My son did an 8th grade trip to Washington DC with four kids to a room, two kids to each queen bed.  I never gave it a second thought.  If a kid wasn't comfortable, a sleeping bag on the floor is an option.  I'm surprised for your trip this wasn't a solution, either in your room or somewhere else with a cousin sleepover buddy.\nWhat would you do if you had two kids and wanted to stay at a hotel?  Get an additional room so everyone could have those own bed?", "On class trips, 100%. 4 girls to a room, 2 queen beds.", "What makes sharing a bed inappropriate? Yes, often on overnight trips it's 4 to a room with 2 beds. So either share a bed or sleep on the floor", "Absolutely this. \u201cWhy are you so insistent about whose bed my daughter shares? This is weird and creepy behavior from an adult to an 8-year-old child. Why are you being so inappropriate?\u201d Don\u2019t just imply it, explicitly tell them this is gross. Shame them for it.", "Ask them why this matters so much to them.  She\u2019s YOUR daughter.", "Love this. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I don't think Cass's preferences need to be rugswept, but I also don't think they needed to be communicated.\n\nIf you read OP's post, these people are not reasonable. She chose to spend time with them anyway, and as a result of her explaining about Cass not wanting to share a bed, her daughter was hounded, guilted, and called weird and spoiled. As a parent, OP's most important job is to keep her daughter safe. From an emotional standpoint, she failed - she kept Cass from being uncomfortable about the sleeping arrangements, but made Cass's waking hours significantly worse. My suggestion would have alleviated this - they only targeted Cass because they saw her as the one with the problem (OP basically said, \"I'm fine with it but she's not\"), so if OP hasn't done that, Cass wouldn't have been targeted. A similar result could have been achieved if OP put a stop to the targeting once it started by saying, \"Look, we appreciate the invitation, but we made other arrangements for this visit. If you say one more word to any of us about those arrangements or why we made them, we will end the visit right then and there.\" \n\nThe reason I called OP an AH is because ultimately it was her decision to stay at the hotel, but Cass paid the price for that decision. I don't particularly care HOW OP avoided that scenario, but she should have.\n\nNot to get all doomsday or anything, but I'd also be concerned that something happened to Cass at a sleepover, given that she's never been asked to share a bed (that OP knows of) but was \"adamant\" about not doing so. Again, nothing wrong with not wanting to share a bed, but that seems like a very strong reaction from someone who (presumably) has no experience of sharing.", "But apparently you need to be privileged to assert bodily autonomy, not everyone can afford a hotel room to avoid their family", "Are you expected to share their bed?", "No, actually it's NOT the definition of bullying. Of course like many things you can interpret that how you want.", "You disappoint reddit with your confrontational naivety.", "The mom hasn't grown out of it", "I think i shared a hotel bed with another girl on every overnight school trip. I specifically remember one trip in middle school where it turned out one girl was a bed wetter, and nobody wanted to share a bed with her anymore and we ended up with 3 girls in my bed.", "I do believe the daughter is heavily influenced by OP. She clearly thinks its weird and her reaction influenced the kid. Or just her parenting style. If mom says it\u2019s inappropriate to change in front of other girls the kid will believe the same.", "It\u2019s a good life skill to have??????? In what universe?", "And why? Her autonomy could have been protected and preserved even with compromise", "I feel the same. Always go for a private room and bathroom whenever feasible. It\u2019s not rude. If OP had explained it like you just did. Maybe these folks with who they have gotten along with for 8+ years would have reacted differently.\n\nInstead they went with \u201cWe need to get a hotel because the young child is uncomfortable and refuses.\u201d Which very naturally makes people wonder why she feels that way. If it can be worked through. If some compromise can be made.\n\nThis does not make OP an asshole in the situation. But neither are people questioning an 8 year old getting hotel rooms on demand. OP kinda set her daughter up to be questioned, pressured and cajoled. When it was not strictly necessary. If total transparent honesty is going to leave people with questions you don\u2019t want to hear, maybe some vague wording or a little white lie is a better strategy. Cut it off at the pass.", "That\u2019s not the reason OP gave though. She literally told them it\u2019s because the daughter doesn\u2019t want to share. Which of course is going to offend people.", "Honestly it is inappropriate,  most SA cases are by family members,  and another of the time its other kids; cousins, siblings...it happens way too often. And people keep glossing over that kind of shit", "There kids who probably wanted to tell scary stories and have fun. I think if I was a kid I\u2019d feel hurt my cousin wouldn\u2019t want to spend time with me", "The child isn\u2019t comfortable with it & neither is the parent.  That\u2019s the only thing that matters.  Any relative\u2019s opinions about what is &/or is not normal & good aren\u2019t relevant.", "> I don't know if it's any form of anxiety or something else that hinders OP from changing in a locker room. But it's not \"normal.\"\n\nWhy are you insisting that it's normal to get naked around complete strangers?", "I did the same thing with my husband's grandson. His granddaughter was cool with hugs, but he didn't seem too comfortable with it. I asked him if he would prefer to high five instead. Now we battle at how hard we hit each other's hands. Note: i was certainly not a hugger when I was a kid, and still with most family members (including my parents), I might let them help me, but I feel uncomfortable returning it.", "Omg I wish my mom was like you\u2026\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom and I took a train from Nevada to Colorado. It was a several day trip. During the second day, my mom saw that a boy who was just a little older than me was sitting by some empty seats. She insisted we go sit with him even though I didn\u2019t want to. The boy end up being super inappropriate and kept touching me even though I said no and stop. He was like 12 and I was 8. My mom ignored all of this. Then he tried to kiss me and I begged my mom to let us go somewhere else and to get this boy to leave me alone. She just told me I was being a baby and that he likes me so I should just put up with it. It finally took the strangers sitting in the row behind us to make him stop and get my mom to do anything.\n\nI had nightmares about that boy for several months after that. The whole time we were at my grandmother\u2019s house I kept seeing him out of the corner of my eye. I didn\u2019t want to be alone ever (which is really not like me, I\u2019m an introvert and very big on alone time). I also believed my mom\u2019s shaming words. I thought that I was just a baby and my reactions were bad, not his actions or the fact that the person I was supposed to trust refused to help me.\n\nNTA, OP. Good on you for protecting your daughter and showing her that her boundaries and bodily autonomy deserve respect.", "My husbands family are big huggers. I always tell all the kids they don\u2019t have to hug me if they don\u2019t want to when their parents send them around to hug everyone goodbye. I hope it makes a difference to them.", "Exactly. In my team nobody used the cubicle, but even if, nobody would've bet an eye. It's just something nobody would've cared about either way. (Though, for everyone always asking \"but isn't it weird\", it's not like we'd always blatantly stare at each others private parts, everyone was busy changing themselves and if you do look at others while changing because you're chatting, you'd usually just look at their faces. No need to make everything weird and/or sexual. I mean, of course you do you, no judgement in not wanting to change in front of anyone else, but still, some (not all!) would do good in remembering naked bodies are natural and shouldn't be a big thing)", "OP talks about having great relationships with her in-laws. She might never have seen this side of them until this issue. Your assessment is based on hindsight.\n\nBesides, even if you disagree with the hindsight argument and still want to say that OP is TA for bringing Cass's preferences to light, the judgment should still be E S H because if she has to tiptoe around the in-laws, that means they are assholes.", "They probably would ask a child to vacate a room for a night or two if someone else is staying but usually no sharing beds unless you are children (unless it's the whole family sharing the same room/bed). They are just touchy about hospitality, you can offend by not accepting it. \n\nOnce I stayed at a creepy old former 40 year old govt housing (given by the govt to a former retired soldier) owned by family. It had no shower or even hot water (bucket method), bathroom drained to the back garden, no kitchen, tadami style bedrooms (so no bed), insects like you wouldn't believe, spiders the size of dinner plates (kept me from sleeping well, luckily I only saw that spider on the last day of our stay).

But not that much more to make it unworthy of consideration.", "I understand what you're saying BUT...\n\nIf a group of adults take their (irrational) feelings of rejection and as a group project them into essentially bullying OP and a child that hasn't even hit double digits yet, I don't think they're being honest about their intentions. They did not mean well, they were being selfish and indulgent in their own feelings. They low key meant to be AHs because they did it literally all weekend and said it with their whole chest. At no point did any of the adults consider their behaviour.  They believe they meant well, because...no one likes admitting they suck. \n\nHowever, that kid will always remember the weekend her entire family alienated her and made her feel uncomfortable for not bowing to their demands.
