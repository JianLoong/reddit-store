You can do what you want with it. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as weird to share beds with a family member as everyone is making it out to be.

At the end of the day, it was your choice to get the hotel room and they should recognize that rather than guilting a child.\n\nTo play devil\u2019s advocate a little bit, I can see why some family members may feel sensitive about it. If everyone else stayed at the house and all of their kids shared beds, they may have taken it as you and your child being \u201ctoo good\u201d for that.

I do not share a single bathroom 7 other people. I don't care that they think it's weird, my comfort matters.", "NAH it honestly is a little weird. Kids share beds on vacations all the time, little girls love having sleepovers with their friends & cousins. It\u2019s a great cousin bonding time to stay up late giggling in the dark telling silly stories, etc. Also at 8 years old, she could just sleep on a cushion on the floor, or sleeping bag on the floor in your room or with her cousins. That\u2019s how we all slumber parties back in the day. So, it does make her pretty spoiled and inflexible. I can see how your in-laws were offended.

I don\u2019t know, something doesn\u2019t make sense", "i think the family probably took it as an insult.  hate to make suggestions when we can't turn back clocks, but I would have just had the daughter share the bed with you...her parents...", "NTA, your daughter was uncomfortable with sharing the bed and you found a way to remedy that situation", "On behalf of your daughter, thank you. \n\nMy sister was a very kinetic sleeper who even fell out of bed from all the moving around.

I swore never again.", "This is not a situation where there are AH.  \n\nThe thing is, it is a little strange that an eight-year-old wouldn't top and tail with a cousin and that the parents would support it (and waste money on a hotel room).

You can't stop people from talking.\n\nI obviously don't know your kid but one thing to consider is whether this intransigence is a pattern.  We all have weird little habits but you need to ask yourself if this is just one thing or one of many.  Don't raise her to be unable to adapt.  It'll hurt her.

This pisses me off. To me, this is no different than trying to guilt her into sleeping with creepy uncle. And it's all WOMEN! \n\nIt has NOTHING to do with WHY she's uncomfortable.

I hope next time she doesn't just go along to avoid those comments. Make sure she know you have her back.\n\nYou wouldn't force an adult to share a bed with others if she doesn't want to.

Thank you for listening to your daughter and standing up for her.", "NTA!! You did the right thing and it\u2019s unfortunate that they couldn\u2019t understand and made this the daily discussion that also caused you and your daughter to feel uncomfortable for no reason whatsoever. Interesting that they couldn\u2019t even fathom how anxious and upset they were making her feel about a perfectly acceptable reason for not wanting to share a sleeping space with them just because they forced their children to do so.

I also did not share beds with friends even at sleepovers. I didnt change in front of anyone until gym class in middle school and even then the girls hid behind lockers or figured out ways to change shirts and pants without showing anything. some girls are not comfortable with that and that is also normal. \n\nis what your in law family says is normal, normal? yes for some people. but not for everyone, and that's fine too. your extended family is being really immature about the whole thing.", "NTA \n\nyour child was not comfortable and you're protecting her sense of modesty. absolutely NTA they didn't provide enough beds and you sought out another solution for them to keep bringing it up and to pressure your child is graceless and rude. and marks them clearly as TA", "NTA!", "You were right.  I don\u2019t see what business the others  had for interfering with your perfectly reasonable decision.  No, not all girls share beds.  I have three girls and they have never shared a bed.

Whether or not someone finds this normal I think depends on if they grew up with sisters or close girl cousins. I did not, I have an older brother and my cousins are all 10 years older and lived two hours away, so I didn't grow up sharing beds or changing in front of other people. And now as an adult I hate both of those things. I'll share a bed with a friend if there's no other option, like a couple of years ago I tagged along with a friend to her cousin's wedding not knowing what the accommodations were because her aunt rented out a charming little inn... turns out my friend and i were to share a full size bed and had a shared bathroom with her cousins.  It wasn't until the aunt saw my reaction (nothing crazy, more like an involuntary gasp) when we walked into the room that she realized maybe not everyone is totally down for this and some heads up at least would have been nice. I stayed both nights and didn't say anything because she was being super nice to provide so much for me that weekend. But I got very little sleep that weekend and generally hated being in the hotel.
