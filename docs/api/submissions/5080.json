{"id": 5080, "submission_id": "zpcz9c", "title": "AITA for saying not my problem and filming?", "selftext": "Every Sunday afternoon my ex and I switch custody of our 12yo daughter. We both live close enough to her school for her to be with us during the week, so we just alternate weeks. When I picked her up last Sunday she was in a foul mood. I asked her what was wrong, and she said she fought with her mom. She didn't give me details, and I didn't push because talking about the ex is a delicate area.\n\nSo this afternoon, at four o'clock, my ex showed up. Usually neither my ex nor I enter each other's homes. Daughter gets her stuff and walks to the car. However, daughter refused to come out of her room. Reluctantly, I went outside to tell my ex that daughter wouldn't come out of her room. Ex had That Look on her face and told me to tell her it was time to go, because she was in a hurry. I said \"what do you want me to do? I told her. She won't.\"\n\nShe said I was fucking useless and that she was coming in then. I said okay, because I didn't see much choice. We go in and she tries to open daughter's door, but it is locked. She asks if I have a key, and I said I don't (this was a lie, but I didn't want to give her the key, because I told my daughter I wouldn't unlock her locked door unless of an emergency). She said she was going to report me to the court for keeping her away from daughter and I would lose custody. I said I let her inside, what more could I do?\n\nShe said she was going to be late and I said that's not my problem. My ex knocked and demanded daughter come out. I started filming her when she turned away from me, so I caught that on film. Daughter told her to fuck off. Ex turned to me and started to say something and then saw my phone and asked if I was filming. I said \"you said you were going to lie to the court and say I didn't let you in. I need proof that you are here to defend myself.\"\n\nShe left at that point, and I filmed her until she got to the door in case she broke anything (she didn't). She called me a fuckface when she left. After she left my daughter came out. I took away her phone for the evening for telling her mom to fuck off, but told her I wasn't mad and she can talk to me. She still won't tell me what the fight was about.\n\nNow, I did my best not to antagonize my ex, although I am imperfect. As far as I see, there are two things I can be an asshole for: saying not my problem and filming. Filming I think I had to do for my defense, but by the time she noticed me filming I had proof she was inside, so I could have stopped at that point but continued, so that might be an asshole move. Also saying not my problem was unnecessary. Was I an asshole for those two things, or did the situation warrant it?", "created_utc": 1671409827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpcz9c/aita_for_saying_not_my_problem_and_filming/", "score": 1251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s going to want a bigger say in when she sees either one of you (or doesn\u2019t see you, as the case may be). You and your ex are going to have to have a conversation about how to handle this\u2014which should NOT include *forcing* your daughter to do anything.", "NTA.
