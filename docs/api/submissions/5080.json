{"id": 5080, "submission_id": "zpcz9c", "title": "AITA for saying not my problem and filming?", "selftext": "Every Sunday afternoon my ex and I switch custody of our 12yo daughter. We both live close enough to her school for her to be with us during the week, so we just alternate weeks. When I picked her up last Sunday she was in a foul mood. I asked her what was wrong, and she said she fought with her mom. She didn't give me details, and I didn't push because talking about the ex is a delicate area.\n\nSo this afternoon, at four o'clock, my ex showed up. Usually neither my ex nor I enter each other's homes. Daughter gets her stuff and walks to the car. However, daughter refused to come out of her room. Reluctantly, I went outside to tell my ex that daughter wouldn't come out of her room. Ex had That Look on her face and told me to tell her it was time to go, because she was in a hurry. I said \"what do you want me to do? I told her. She won't.\"\n\nShe said I was fucking useless and that she was coming in then. I said okay, because I didn't see much choice. We go in and she tries to open daughter's door, but it is locked. She asks if I have a key, and I said I don't (this was a lie, but I didn't want to give her the key, because I told my daughter I wouldn't unlock her locked door unless of an emergency). She said she was going to report me to the court for keeping her away from daughter and I would lose custody. I said I let her inside, what more could I do?\n\nShe said she was going to be late and I said that's not my problem. My ex knocked and demanded daughter come out. I started filming her when she turned away from me, so I caught that on film. Daughter told her to fuck off. Ex turned to me and started to say something and then saw my phone and asked if I was filming. I said \"you said you were going to lie to the court and say I didn't let you in. I need proof that you are here to defend myself.\"\n\nShe left at that point, and I filmed her until she got to the door in case she broke anything (she didn't). She called me a fuckface when she left. After she left my daughter came out. I took away her phone for the evening for telling her mom to fuck off, but told her I wasn't mad and she can talk to me. She still won't tell me what the fight was about.\n\nNow, I did my best not to antagonize my ex, although I am imperfect. As far as I see, there are two things I can be an asshole for: saying not my problem and filming. Filming I think I had to do for my defense, but by the time she noticed me filming I had proof she was inside, so I could have stopped at that point but continued, so that might be an asshole move. Also saying not my problem was unnecessary. Was I an asshole for those two things, or did the situation warrant it?", "created_utc": 1671409827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpcz9c/aita_for_saying_not_my_problem_and_filming/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t want to keep being put in this position in your one home - you need legal advice for your case specific on what to do.", "NTA\n\nI think overall you did the right thing for your daughter. They may have fought over something serious, or it may have been something small. You don't know. But what you do know is that your daughter is upset, uncomfortable, and didn't want to be around her mother.\n\nThe mother threatened you, filming it wasn't wrong. She was being hostile. And yeah maybe it was kinda smart a** ish, but it really isn't your problem if she's late. You're not making her late, that's between her and her daughter. \n\nI'd definitely find out what's going on though..", "NTA - props for not unlocking the door. She threatened legal action, so there\u2019s no harm in getting proof that she would be lying", "Not the AH. I had a friend who had to film everything involving the ex because she always lied. \nMore importantly is what went on with the daughter and mother. Must have been something pretty traumatic to evoke such a reaction. \nGood luck here. \nDocument everything.", "Based on what you\u2019ve written, NTA. You have every right to film what goes on in your house. If your ex doesn\u2019t like it, she can leave. \n\nBut keep in mind that your daughter is 12 now. She\u2019s going to want a bigger say in when she sees either one of you (or doesn\u2019t see you, as the case may be). You and your ex are going to have to have a conversation about how to handle this\u2014which should NOT include *forcing* your daughter to do anything.", "NTA. I think your daughter is old enough to decide where/when/who she visits. Something happened at her mom's and you need to find out what. She (the ex) stated she was going to lie in court. You needed proof.", "Not going to pass judgment because I don't know what your custody order is and what state you're in. If you were in my state with my parents custody order, you would be the AH though and you would have just done something illegal on 2 fronts.\n\nYou need to call your family court divorce attorney and find out if your recording your ex without her approval was legal. Then you need to find out whether your 12 year old is legally old enough to refuse to follow the custody order or whether you are required to still force her physically to follow it.\n\nI was the kid in this situation as a kid, so I really hate saying this....but, if the court order says that you have to physically shove your kid into your ex's car, then look, I'm sorry, but you have to do that. It's not fair and it's traumatising, but it's not good for your daughter if you get yourself arrested for contempt of court and get her put into more time at her mom's if something bad is happening over there.", "NTA.  It genuinely isn't your problem that your ex is running on a tight schedule, and unless you did something to stoke your daughter's feelings about her mom, her lack of respect for the mother also is not your problem.  Filming someone you don't trust when they are in your house after they've threatened you with legal action is a reasonable safety measure.", "NTA for filming.  If you had stopped, there's no telling how the situation could have escalated.  Soft YTA for saying it wasn't your problem.  You could have been more tactful about that.  Something along the lines of \"Look, I'm not sure what's going on.  Can you tell me why our daughter is still so upset?\"  The reality is that whatever is going on between your ex and your daughter IS your problem precisely because of the situation you find yourself in now.", "ESH - I think it might take hours to get the whole hairy story here, but it\u2019s pretty obvious to me that this is a vicious game for the ex and you, and purgatory for your daughter.", "NTA. Needing proof is good. Only you know if you should or shouldn't have stopped filming earlier and the answer to this influences NTA/YTA. But pretty heavy NTA imo.", "I think I can see why she's your ex. NTA. You did the right thing by filming the entire encounter, because your ex could still try to take you to court over it. Be sure to back that video up to at least two or three other places and don't ever delete it.", "No, ESH. Your ex has a problem with the kid, and you both should talk about it so you can make a team. Right now your daughter can manipulate you both. And she does. So instead of arguing together, try talk without judgement outside the hearing of your child. Decide together what woukd be best. This behaviour of both of you is harming her.", "ESH. \n\nYou and your ex sound like you are too wrapped up being assholes to each other to care about the impact it's having on your daughter. No wonder she locked herself in her room.", "NTA. You set your boundary in your own home by telling her it wasn't your problem. You filming her was the right choice to keep her honest and accountable. She shouldn't make shitty threats about removing your child from your life when you've done nothing wrong.", "ESH.  I feel so sorry for your daughter.  Rather than focusing on her, you and your ex make this all about you.", "YTA. Your daughter having a fight with her mother doesn't give you the right to violate your custody agreement. It's your job to get your kid ready to swap off and you didn't make that happen. \n\nLying about the key, filming your ex instead of trying to get your daughter out of her room, telling your kid it's all basically good...your ex should take you back to court for sure. You're lucky she just left instead of calling the cops.", "You\u2019re an asshole for not unlocking the door. YTA. If your daughter doesn\u2019t want to see her mom, that has to be done through the proper channels. In this case, you needed to know the details of the fight with her mom. If the kid won\u2019t tell you what the fight was about, she has to go to mom\u2019s.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a very **special** kind of *person* that weaponize their children and threaten to lie to courts to mess with parental visitations. I don't have a lot of sympathy for your ex.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Sounds like you\u2019ve been doing your best not to put your daughter in the middle of the issues you have with your ex.", "ETA aside from the kid. You\u2019re both failing as parents. Learn to communicate otherwise your daughter will never be able to have a normal relationship of her own.\n\nOn one hand, good on you for allowing her privacy and keeping your promises. But, on the other hand, you\u2019ve dropped the ball dealing with her mother. Filming escalated the situation and neither of you acted like adults or parents with your petty, childish squabbling.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about this one incident. There\u2019s history here. And things like this will keep happening until you get your parenting in check.", "ESH that isn't your kid.
