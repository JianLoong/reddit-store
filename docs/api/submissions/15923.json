About a year into the relationship we moved in together because it was cheaper and my ex couldn\u2019t afford any place alone. I made about 3x as much as he did so I paid for everything. He did have a good job in sales but got laid off. Then he tried to claim disability for CFS(not pandemic related) to get SSA but they denied it. So he\u2019s been working 20-30 hours a week at a book keeping job that pays $18/h. Because he frequently takes time off most jobs don\u2019t want him and he knows the owner so they are lenient with his time off but in return he doesn\u2019t get a great salary. It\u2019s not nearly enough to live off of so I\u2019ve been covering most of the rent, food etc. he also has credit card debt that he\u2019s just been making money payment on. \n\nMy main problem was that he didn\u2019t make much and he also didn\u2019t do almost any housework. He says he\u2019s fatigued and probably is depressed but he gained 60lb since we met and hasn\u2019t really worked out and eats terribly, most fast food all the time if I don\u2019t cook. He is in bed all day some days and some days has more energy but didn\u2019t help out much other then the occasional taking out the trash. \n\nSo I work more than 40hs a week (I take overtime usually an extra hour or 2) and I come home and dishes aren\u2019t done, he\u2019s just ordered fast food and I have to clean up. It felt like I was living with an overgrown child tbh. I understand he has physical and mental health issues but it felt like I was doing everything. I couldn\u2019t imagine marrying or having kids with him because I would just have more work. \n\nSo 4 month ago when the lease was ending I told him I wasn\u2019t resigning and he could leave or resign with a roommate or something. I know he can\u2019t do it, he didn\u2019t make enough but I was done. He got angry, tried to guilt me by saying I was a horrible person for leaving him with no way to pay rent and begged me to reconsider saying he\u2019ll try harder but I just felt like I had given him 2 years of my life and I didn\u2019t want to give any more. \n\nSo I moved out and he had to as well and had been couch surfing for a while. Last week he texts me and begged to let him stay at my place (that I share with my roommate). His family are pretty shitty but his mom might take him in but they don\u2019t get along so that\u2019s why he is probably trying to avoid going home. \n\nI don\u2019t think I have an obligation anymore because we are no longer together but there is some guilt because I know he can\u2019t rent a place with his income.

He doesn\u2019t get to take any more time from you.", "No, NTA.\n\nYour ex probably does have mental health struggles, but you are not his caretaker.

All the things she pointed out just make sense for a very ill person. He barely scrapes by with work, he has no energy for housework/cooking, of course he lays in bed and eats fast food. \n\nI hate that so many people see being disabled as a failure of character. \n\nIf he was able to get on disability and get a caregiver to do house chores, the work wouldn't fall onto her. (Which doesn't matter now since she's already done, but is important to say as having a disabled spouse shouldn't be a \"ruin your life\" level repercussion.)\n\nLife is much better for my husband and I after I got on disability so I brought in *some* money at least, and found a caregiver program in my state that provides basically free caregiving for disabled peeps. (You don't have to be on disability to use the program, they have their own way of measuring your ability.)", "I gave him 2 months.

You don't know how bad his symptoms are, and getting denied disability isn't proof that he's well enough, as it's very common for even totally bedridden people to be forced to appeal over and over. Mostly due to lack of education on these types of diseases. \n\nThere's a huge gap between even people with the same disease-- my disease can range from \"living a normal life with small lifestyle changes\" to \"completely bedridden and can't lift your head from the pillow to drink for six months\". \n\nIt's not wrong for OP to be honest that she can't handle the housework on top of chores etc. But don't just accuse him of being lazy just because you are able to hold down a job despite your illness. Not all of us can.", "Respectfully I think it's possible you may be giving too much credit to this fellow. It's a very human tendency to see ourselves in others. But, sometimes people are just lazy moochers who weaponize incompetency and employ guilt tactics. \n\nThat being said I wanted to send you a message but I was not allowed. I'm just curious where you (generally) live. My brother is disabled and lives with me as a medical dependent. I've taken on his care and become his representative since my mom passed away last summer. I would really like to see his quality of life improve but social security is a labyrinth and it's feels impossible to get them to communicate much less give information on programs that help people isolated due to disabilities. Just wondering if you might live nearish me (in Florida) and know of anything beneficial. Thanks.", "Ah. Yeah then definitely NTA.", "I hope you didn't tell him where you lived.", "No he just knows I\u2019m still in the same city"]}
