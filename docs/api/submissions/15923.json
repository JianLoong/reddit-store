About a year into the relationship we moved in together because it was cheaper and my ex couldn\u2019t afford any place alone. I made about 3x as much as he did so I paid for everything. He did have a good job in sales but got laid off. Then he tried to claim disability for CFS(not pandemic related) to get SSA but they denied it. So he\u2019s been working 20-30 hours a week at a book keeping job that pays $18/h. Because he frequently takes time off most jobs don\u2019t want him and he knows the owner so they are lenient with his time off but in return he doesn\u2019t get a great salary. It\u2019s not nearly enough to live off of so I\u2019ve been covering most of the rent, food etc. he also has credit card debt that he\u2019s just been making money payment on. \n\nMy main problem was that he didn\u2019t make much and he also didn\u2019t do almost any housework. He says he\u2019s fatigued and probably is depressed but he gained 60lb since we met and hasn\u2019t really worked out and eats terribly, most fast food all the time if I don\u2019t cook. He is in bed all day some days and some days has more energy but didn\u2019t help out much other then the occasional taking out the trash. \n\nSo I work more than 40hs a week (I take overtime usually an extra hour or 2) and I come home and dishes aren\u2019t done, he\u2019s just ordered fast food and I have to clean up. It felt like I was living with an overgrown child tbh. I understand he has physical and mental health issues but it felt like I was doing everything. I couldn\u2019t imagine marrying or having kids with him because I would just have more work. \n\nSo 4 month ago when the lease was ending I told him I wasn\u2019t resigning and he could leave or resign with a roommate or something. I know he can\u2019t do it, he didn\u2019t make enough but I was done. He got angry, tried to guilt me by saying I was a horrible person for leaving him with no way to pay rent and begged me to reconsider saying he\u2019ll try harder but I just felt like I had given him 2 years of my life and I didn\u2019t want to give any more. \n\nSo I moved out and he had to as well and had been couch surfing for a while. Last week he texts me and begged to let him stay at my place (that I share with my roommate). His family are pretty shitty but his mom might take him in but they don\u2019t get along so that\u2019s why he is probably trying to avoid going home. \n\nI don\u2019t think I have an obligation anymore because we are no longer together but there is some guilt because I know he can\u2019t rent a place with his income.

But that type of projection causes people to strongly criticize disabled folks who literally physically can't -- or they physically can't without extremely harsh repercussions that a healthy person doesn't need to watch out for. \n\nTo give a recent example from my life, I had to do a small physical task and if I worked 5min I would only recover enough to continue after 2 hours of rest-- and that's on a good health day. My body is truly shithoused. \n\nI don't see anything in her post that implies he is just maliciously lazy because he knows someone will clean up after him. And I know from lived experiences that most healthy people will assume bad things about you, as a disabled person, before looking at your condition rationally. \n\nI live in WA, and if anyone in the area needs the caregiver program I use, it's managed by [Washington Connection](https://www.washingtonconnection.org/home/) and CDWA. They can set you up with an agency, or you can have an individual care provider. There's pros and cons to each. \n\nI did a quick search and found [this website](https://elderaffairs.org/resource-directory/caregiver-assistance-programs/) and [this guide](https://www.joingivers.com/how-to-get-paid-caregiver/florida), both of which have several options. \n\nOne problem I personally ran into is most of these programs are geared towards older folks, and you need to do a little digging to find out if younger disabled folks are covered. In addition to these resources, you can check in with local churches as some of them provide services (like giving rides, taking people to Dr appointments, etc) to local disabled peeps. \n\n[This](https://www.olmsteadrights.org/self-helptools/advocacy-resources/item.6623-Florida_Disability_Resources_and_Advocacy_Organizations) is a list of disability rights orgs, and those tend to be well connected with local resources. A lot of resources are very difficult to find, so connections/word of mouth helps a ton. \n\nThere's also [Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/disability) which has great legal advice for getting on disability, in case your brother is not on yet. The process can be long and arduous, so their advice really helps. \n\nHope you find a useful program that works for y'all, it can be extremely difficult to be a caregiver without support structures.", "She still isn't responsible for where he lives.", "Definitely, I wanted to post because I know fellow disabled folks reading this thread are taking hits to their self-esteem.
