That life insurance policy may or may not have been set up for same.  If it was, then your mom may have had the right to use it as she sees fits to support you as long as it wasnt used for something that solely benefitted her. Housing, car, house hold bills, food, family travels, extra cirricular activities etc are all things that are covered by child support.  Chances are that policy was his guarantee of child support.   As your trustee and guardian, she had an obligation to use the funds appropriately (a fiduciary duty) and if she failed to uphold that duty she may be liable.    \n\n If the policy was not meant to be child support but a seperate additional policy,  then you may have a case.  More information is needed before an opinion can be formed.     \n\nLots of complictaed issues which vary from state to state.  I reccommend getting two opinions on your rights.

When you fill out who your beneficiaries are for life insurance you need to consider if you list minors that you trust who their guardian will be with what you\u2019re leaving, as they will have control of that money. \n\nFor A LOT of co-parents who aren\u2019t together this takes the beneficiaries in a totally different direction. If your dad trusted your mom, then this is what it is.  If he didn\u2019t, he shouldn\u2019t have listed you as a beneficiary and picked someone who would be more appropriate and would do what he wanted with his funds.  \n\nI do think you got a crap hand dealt here, not your fault. A parent dying young sucks for more than just one reason.", "NTA\n\nUsually when a spouse dies, the life insurance goes to the spouse, unless there are other beneficiaries listed on the policy. I'm surprised that your dad left it to you and your brother (maybe a little bit skeptical). It's not unheard of.  But typically that money is for the spouse to pay for living expense, as now it's only one parent's income.  I doesn't make a lot of sense to pay for college out of life insurance, when a single parent won't be able to pay the bills without it. If I die, my life insurance will go to my husband.  It will mainly help pay for the mortgage and my son's health insurance. It's not for his college.  He needs a financially stable life first.\n\nWith that said, your mom squandered the money she received. Joining an MLM, buying an expensive car is a waste of that money. Going on vacation is not necessarily a waste if you are going as a family. Vacation are good for everyone's mental health. Of course, it sounds like your mom went a big overboard.", "My parents died when I was prior to 18, and before my dad passed, he used most of the life insurance money that my mom's death had paid out (to myself and sister). Then he passed as well (No life insurance), I also lost a small (10k) amount that was put aside for college from my grandma when she passed (2008 when stocks went into freefall) prior to me turning 18. \n\nI'll put this the best way I can, Sure the life insurance money would have been cool, and I have student loans and I look at those and imagine not having them because of that insurance money and such, but it doesn't matter. It's gone, it was mismanaged and that's that. My dad managed to burn through 100k~ left to me by life insurance before I even turned 18 to receive it. It really sucks, but it wasn't money you \"earned\" nor was it money I \"earned\" so it's just life's way of kicking you in the nads occasionally. \n\nI'd just let it go, it's not worth burning down family relations for it. Grand scheme of things, that 40k isn't a ton, it feels like that now because it's a huge nest egg to start life with, but in your 70s, i doubt you'll still see it the same. I do agree it sucks though, i'd still be upset, but it's worth moving past it.

Did mom give the brother the money for college or was son named a beneficiary.", "Yeah a lot of advice in this thread is going to be utterly worthless to OP. \n\nIt was life insurance, so first and foremost: who was the beneficiary? If it was mom, then OP's SOL.\n\nSecond of all, if OP and brother were the beneficiaries, she spent the money raising OP, regardless of how poorly she spent it and there are always arguments to be made for or against on every expenditure: She bought herself a car? Well, that means more money for food on the table. The point being, it's not a slam dunk that just because she spent it in ways that OP doesn't agree with, she actually mis-managed funds. \n\nThirdly, even IF OP was supposed to be a beneficiary, and even IF it could be proved that mom misused the funds to such a degree that OP could get a judgment...it doesn't sound like mom has any such money to pay OP back, so then what? And I highly doubt any attorney looking at these facts is going to take this on contingency. So that leaves OP paying out of pocket to win a Pyrrhic victory. \n\nThat does them NO good. The truth of the matter is that a lot of us would be frustrated with the choices our parents made if we could all audit their accounts. Our parents aren't perfect. We strive to learn and be better.", "Being held in trust and being held in a trust fund/account are different. Someone can hold money \"in trust\" in any form of account. Misappropriation of funds that are held in trust means money held for another person in a trusting fashion that was used dishonestly and for personal gain. If it was held in a trust fund/account, it would be called mismanagement of a trust fund. I know these two are different because I have been through the courts with family with both situations.", "You make valid points.  Here's the other one - most lawyers wouldn't even consider a case that has a max value of $40k.  It simply costs more than that to put the case together and get it to court, especially if they take it on a contingency of 1/3, meaning that the lawyer's max is going to be $13,333.00.  Add - at an absolute minimum - another $5K in expenses, filing fees, etc., and the limited possibility of recovery (i.e. \"blood from a turnip\") and litigation is not likely to happen.  \n\nThe better solution may be to do whatever FAFSA requires to become emancipated from parents so OP doesn't have to count mom's income when applying for resources.  That's not easy, and may not even be possible (it's been decades since I had to deal with those forms) but that would maximize money for college.  On the other hand - if mom has no countable resources able to pay for college, it doesn't matter if her income is reported or not.", "Depends on the situation \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", ">If he didn\u2019t, he shouldn\u2019t have listed you as a beneficiary and picked someone who would be more appropriate and would do what he wanted with his funds.\n\nThis is important people, if you're in a similar situation to OP's Dad the smart thing to do is to have the insurance money funneled into a trust that can't be dispersed until the child is of age. This is something to discuss with an estate attorney.\n\nNTA OP, only thing you can do is consult with an attorney for options and for your own sanity go Low Contact or No Contact.", "She said her dad was a raging alcoholic, so who knows what state of mind he was in when setting up the beneficiaries.", "NTA.   Get a lawyer.", "NTA, and I'd cut her off as and go no contact. I couldn't forgive someone who should have put me first but instead screwed me over for selfish gain. \n\nI don't think you have any recourse due to the low amount (I know, but legally speaking 40k is chump change), having the burden to prove she spent irresponsibly, and the fact that she sounds broke so what's the point if she has no money to recoup.\n\nBUT if you are in the US she should have been getting Social Security death benefits which, upon your 18th birthday and assuming you are still in school, you should be able to receive instead of her. It's not great, but better than nothing.\n\nI'm so sorry you were betrayed like that.", "How did she have access to this money? If it was life insurance and she was divorced from your father, who was the policy granted to? Her directly or you and your brother? That money should have gone into a trust but trusts sometimes are set up to be accessed by your guardian to pay for you. \n\nNTA but I couldn't tell you if legally if you have a claim. If you're American, she should have gotten Social Security payments for you as well so I'm curious if she applied for those. Okay, you said she did that. \n\nI don't think I would trust her at this point or have much of a relationship with her as she clearly did blow your money. Vacations you didn't need, a too expensive car, an MLM, fixed her teeth but didn't take you to the dentist?!!! Yeah, your mother is an asshole.\n\nSo she went through $600/month from your inheritance+ ~$700/month from SSI. Sorry dude. She should have helped you with your medical bills at least. It wasn't $8K/year. It was more like ~ $16K a year. Then she moved in with a rich dude. Morally I think she did steal from you.", "YTA", "NTA. I would sue her.", "NTA You could probably due her and get some money back.", "I suspect you're correct.  The operative words: \"judgment proof\".", "Emancipation obviously isn't necessary since OP is 26. FAFSA considers anyone 24 and older independent. Also, there is a good chance that OP isn't even in school anymore since they mention having lots of student debt because they didn't get the money for college.", "NTA, I\u2019m not sure if you would be able to sue but in any case you should tell anyone and everyone. Siblings, grandparents, family friends, her so if she\u2019s dating. Shout it to the world that you\u2019re mom left you unprepared for life after lying to you for years", "NTA and lawyer up.", "NTA. Lots of encouragement to sue, but that is a massive investment in a process that disrupts your life for someone who can\u2019t likely pay a judgement.\n\nOne avenue to consider is did your mom collect social security while you were a minor? Since your father died while you were a minor, she would have been eligible.  It seems unlikely but maybe an application could be made for back benefits.", "NTA...contact a lawyer right away. Sadly my uncle and his wife did this to his step daughter. she sued and got it all back because the money wasn't theirs to spend. Your mom failed you.", "My mother did this to me too and the key component of it is spending outside her means. My mother never stopped spending outside her means even after the money from my dad was gone, and guess who she took it from then - directly from me, from money I earned. She would pressure me into giving up scholarship money, threaten that she was \"going to lose the house\" and try to justify it in that I would supposedly get the house when she died etc. Eventually, I realised I was being financially abused. I cut her off and just stopped letting her abuse me. When she dies she'll die with nothing but debt and I won't inherit a bloody thing but she was never homeless. She's just fine without my money to fall back on. You can do the same you don't owe her anything for being born.", "NTA, your mom straight up stole from you, especially since you said they were divorced at the time. That money was left for you, not for her to have a fancier lifestyle. She knew what she was doing, make no mistake about it. How dare she tried to shame you by telling you she had to \u201ckeep the roof over your head\u201d, she\u2019s trying to deflect cause she knew what she did was shady.", "NTA, that's awful!", "Normally I wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d see a dime as the life insurance was for caring for you but she threw it in the trash on an MLM and most reasonable adults wouldn\u2019t throw away their child\u2019s future. Unfortunately I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever see a dime of this and I hope you learn from this and avoid MLM\u2019s and set up a will to specifically set money towards your kids educations.\n\nNTA", "She did recieve social security survivor checks for me.", "She had a job right, so easily paid by job.", "Well OP would get those possessions so he would still win", "OP, it might be time for you to quit focusing on what could have been and move on.

Move on.", "Same thing happened to me. I was 11, divorced mom got money from wrongful death. Gave a bunch to our church and she freaked when I asked about helping with college.with that money. She paid for food and housing etc that's what we got. Sorry but I haven't found a way to get it back if it's gone, it's gone.", "NTA but your mom sure was. I am surprised that the money was left in your mother's control being that she was divorced from your dad. Do you have access to the insurance documentation? Is there something that specifically states what this money was to be used for?  Is there any way to legally recover the money from your mother?  I am not sure how life insurance payouts for a minor works.", "You should find a lawyer and sue her.  If she is still working, you could get a judgement and they'd garnish her wages and you'd get weekly or monthly payments.  Is she has a 401k, she might have to cash that in and pay you.", "no contact as in I'm done with you.", "We do not know all the particulars or the legal ramifications in your area.  Do you know if your mother has access to $40,000 plus to be able to reimburse you ?  You need legal advice =, starting with a free initial consultation.  You also need to balance the cost of what it will cost you to sue your mother.  Unless you get a judgement that includes her paying your legal fees, this could cost you more than you could possibly get back if your mother has no assets.  It does not matter how wealthy her boyfriend is if she has no assets in her name.  Believe me, I sympathize .  My stepmother robbed me and my siblings.  kt", "If your mom does not have any financial assets, you cannot get money from her.  She may have used some of the money to house and feed you, and keep the utilities on for the both of you.  It sounds like she made some poor choices along the way, like the vacations and a more expensive car than was necessary .  I jus do not know how you can get money from someone who does not have any, or any expectation of getting any in the future.  My mom got social security benefits for my two underage brothers after my father became disabled .  She used them  to supplement her salary so we could stay in our home with utilities and food.  Neither of my brothers had any expectations that she was saving the money for them to give them at a later date.  I am sorry your mother did not manage the funds better.  I could see cutting her out of your life.  kt", "What difference does the financial status of her boyfriend have to do with the money your mother may have spent raising you from 13 to 18?  I understand the burning anger of having been cheated.  My stepmother and step sisters cheated me after my father died.  Get some free legal advice after you do some research on your own. Look up   the source of the life insurance policy.  See if you can find how the beneficiary clause was written.  See if your mother has any financial assets in her own name that are accessible .  Talk to your mother .  The bottom line is that if she has nothing in her name, you will get nothing.  kt"]}
