If it only took one dirty plate to totally break the friendship? My friends know they don't need to do a damn thing in my house no matter how many dishes they dirty. Yet they do still try to do my dishes (not just one but all of them) because they love me and want to help out. This whole thing is wild.", "ESH. \n\nBad host and bad guest. It\u2019s a race to the bottom. Apparently neither of you felt the friendship was worth a few minutes of washing or the cost of paper plates.", "IMHO there is nothing wrong with \\*asking\\* a friend to wash their own plate, but your friend is also correct that most guests are not expected to wash any dishes.  I have never once had my host ask me to wash my own plate (or any other plate), and I've been a guest at multiple houses in different geographical areas and cultures.   It is very normal that your friend was not washing his plate at your house.\n\nYou stated you \"told\" him to wash his plate (meaning a command/demand), and then a few sentences later you stated you \"suggest\"ed that he wash his plate (meaning a request).  Which was it? Because those aren't even close to the the same thing, and which one is the truth would go a long way in determining whether or not YTA.  I feel like you're leaving a lot out here.", "I would never ask a guest in my house to wash their dishes.\n\nWhen I visit others I ask what they would like me to do with my dishes and if they asked I would wash them. But that has never happened to me.\n\nYTA. \n\nIf you set the precedent from the first time your guest used a dish in your house than I would say NTA, but to wait for however many weeks/months/years, and then say it? Yikes, YTA, and your friend probably felt the resentment coming off of you in waves. If your friend was the one to terminate the friendship that was a good call.", "ESH. It\u2019s rude to ask a guest to wash their own dishes. It\u2019s also rude for a guest to say no if they are asked to help clean up. You\u2019re both immature and rude. \n\nThere are lots of cultural differences that people have around this stuff. Some people think it\u2019s never a guest\u2019s responsibility to clean anything. Some people think a guest should offer to help clean up. Some people think the guest is supposed to offer to help but the host is always supposed to say no. Some people think a guest should just start cleaning up without asking. It\u2019s inevitable that you encounter people who have different norms. The keys to dealing with it though are recognizing that Your Way is not The One True Way For Everyone, and that you should be polite and kind if you want to indicate that a guest should do something different. You didn\u2019t do either.", "YTA. The only time I've ever let a guest do any dishes when visiting was when we had a newborn. It was my best friend, and she was like, shut up and let me help. I would never ask a guest to tidy up. \n\nIn saying that, if my friend asked me at their house I'd just do it.\n\nI can't believe this whole friendship is over because of a plate.", "YTA. As a host, you shouldn\u2019t be telling your guests to do anything, not even asking them. It would be nice if he stepped up and helped out but geez you\u2019re an awful host for telling him to.", "YTA. This can really just be a matter how being raised differently but your friend was not wrong for saying guests are not obligated to do household duties. They can offer and do it, sure. It\u2019s not something you demand from your friend though. It\u2019s one time a month and you ruined it over some dishes?", "Big egos hey??? You\u2019re both idiots!", "ESH. I wouldn\u2019t ask anyone to wash a plate at my house. Not even family. I\u2019ve never had someone ask me to wash a plate at their house either when I\u2019ve eaten there. The etiquette is that the host handles the dishes, just like he\u2019d be expected to wash the dishes after you eat at his house. But if my friend asked me to, I would have thought it was a little bizarre but I also would have done it.", "Yeah, YTA. Your ex-friend was right, the guest is not required to work. However, the guest may *volunteer*, but it's not  asked for.", "YTA\u2026it\u2019s one plate. The friend is a guest in your house..you shouldn\u2019t have asked him to do it unless there was some reason you couldn\u2019t.

It\u2019s be one thing if he was staying multiple nights and causing many dishes. It\u2019s one plate. You both suck for arguing and ending a friendship over a two second job.", "It's one plate... He's a guest.. I could see this being an issue if this was a roommate situation that happened often, but since this person was a guest and a friend, I'm going to say yta. \n\nIt seems like there were other issues/tension before this because I refuse to believe that a friendship ended like this.", "YTA. I cant believe how many of y'all want your friends to wash dishes in your house. Are you gonna make them reimburse you for the water they drink too?", "ESH. You both picked a petty small hill to die on. Must have not been a very good friendship though if this is all it takes.", "YTA big boy you shouldn't make your boyfriend wash plates", "NTA for obvious reasons but but if the friendship has been terminated over this matter I can't imagine it was a very respectful conversation from either side.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's rude to ask a guest to wash their plate.  If he offers, that's nice but it's one plate.\n\nAt the same time, it's also rude to refuse to wash your own plate if someone has asked you to wash it.\n\nYou're both immature for ending a friendship over a plate.", "ESH. As a host, you shouldn't make your guests clean up after themselves, and as a guest, he should have offered to help. Smh smh.", "For me NTA\n\nIndeed, he is a guest. It\u2019s your home and your rules. If you wish he clean his plate, he should respect that. And that\u2019s the biggest factor for me.\n\nHe is a guest, so he should not only respect your rules but also your hospitality. You are giving him your space for free. If I were him, I\u2019d feel obligated to clean the mess I make. What if he accidentally push something and destroy it? He would not take any responsibility for it?\n\nWhat happens If situation is reversed? Do you have to clean the dishes when you are in his house?\n\nIn general, yes, guest is a guest. I personally don\u2019t allow mine to clean. But it\u2019s your house and your rules. You can ask him politely to clean after himself and there\u2019s nothing bad about it. It\u2019s your right.", "Perhaps I'm going to be hit with a shitstorm of negative comments, but I was raised to clean up after myself when visiting with friends/family, and all of my guests to my house are expected to do the same. Different generations, I guess? I'd say NTA. It seems only polite to be tidy whilst a guest in someone's home.", "NTA \r-  Indeed, he is a guest. It\u2019s your home and your rules.

How rude do you have to be to leave dirty dishes in someone else\u2019s house\ud83d\udc80just because you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s house doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be polite and clean what you made dirty, that\u2019s gross and entitled. You shouldn\u2019t have to be asked to simply wash a dish you used, it\u2019s a given and I can\u2019t believe how many people on here would actually do that and expect others to clean up after them. People clearly were raised with no manners.", "NTA for asking him to wash his plate, but totally YTA if you ended the friendship over it. It can be an awkward transition from guest/host dynamics to \"I value hanging out with you, feel free to help yourself, but that includes tidying up after yourself as a sign of respect for my home and my time.\" Friendship means building bridges over troubled waters together, not parting ways.", "NTA in this particular situation, but there\u2019s obviously more to the story. I perused through all the remarks for more context. Since y\u2019all had been friends for 16 years beforehand, this is clearly about more than just a dirty plate bc both of you would know the expectations of the other by that point. If you want to salvage the friendship, you may have to be assertive and tell him what is the real issue you\u2019re having that has resulted in this resentment.", "Actually, NAH for the plate situation itself. You all just have wildly differing ideas of what it is to be a guest and host. The fact that it couldn't even be discussed without him cutting you off completely makes him the asshole and not a good friend for that.", "You\u2019re generally not supposed to ask guests to wash dishes so I\u2019m inclined to say YTA however it\u2019s more of a ESH as his response is kinda off putting. It\u2019s either they offer to wash their own plate or you wash it.", "Imagine going completely volcanic over a fucking plate. Geez You both sound like toddlers, fighting over a stupid toy 'its mine, no its mine..im never speaking to you again.\n\nESH", "So more information is needed here, did you cook for your friend or did you get takeout takeaway food, because if you cooked and asked him to wash his plate and then you washed the pots and pans and whatever else you used I find it to be a very unusual request, or did you ask him to wash everything?", "You guys must not have been very good friends. I legit yelled at my friend for eating my pizza last night and she still stayed the night, we were literally over it less than 5 minutes later. I don\u2019t think it was rude if you to ask him to do his dishes, but I also don\u2019t think it was rude of him to have expected you to handle it, as he was your guest. I clean up after my guests, possibly because I have ocd and anxiety and can\u2019t look at the mess long enough for them to clean it, but either way, I wouldn\u2019t invite someone over for dinner and expect them to help clean up after.", "NTA. He's staying one weekend a month, the very least he could do was wash his own God damn plate.\n\nThat guest BS goes out the window when someone becomes a regular visitor", "While I would say asking is an appropriate thing to do, if they say no, that no. After reading some of OP's comments though...\n\nYTA\n\nTelling someone to clean their dish with the expectation that they will just do as you say is never okay. What is one dish gonna do to you? Kill you? \n\nWhen I enter someone else's home, I insist I clean my dish because that is how I was raised, but anytime someone told me to clean my dish, it's disrespectful regardless if you are being polite. You're friendship must have not been very important if you \"terminated\" it over a dirty dish that would take less than 5 minutes to clean.", "Right? Me and my friends mock fight to see who will actually get to do the dishes. This is wacky.", "That's the thing though. Your friends offer. My friends would offer, I would offer. OP's didn't.\n\nAnd all OP asked was for him to tidy up after himself", "If I had written \u201c ask\u201d,  it would have looked like I was asking my friend a question.       So I wrote \u201c suggested\u201d  and \u201c told\u201d since I wanted him to do something.    \n\nIt was suggested in a super polite manner that I was astonished he objected and made a big deal over it.    But like you said, and others have also said, I was wrong for telling my guest to clean after his mess.        The fact we know each other for 16 years didn\u2019t make me see him as just a guest.      More likely a family member.", "It was very respectful.     After he objected, I picked up his plate and washed it myself.     He no longer calls me.", "He ended the friendship.        The only way the friendship can be restored is if I make the first move to restore it.   Otherwise it is dead.    \n\nI have a problem with this.      I\u2019ve done so much for this guy.   Too much.        And I hate that he wants me to suck up to him.     He wants me to apologize.    Since he called every other friends of ours and not me, I decided to go my separate way.", "Again, \"suggesting\" that someone do something, and \"telling\" someone to do something, are NOT the same concept.  \"Suggesting\" means a request that can be refused; usually very low pressure.  \"Telling\" is a demand in which you are implying you have authority over the other person.  You just used both terms in your reply, so I have no further information than I did before, unfortunately.\n\nCan you please confirm which method you used to communicate with your friend about the dish - suggesting, or telling? They're mutually exclusive, so please stop using the terms interchangeably as you did in your post and this comment.", "I would add that note in about being friends for 16 years. It matters. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, but then again I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been in that position. Not only am I super hospitable to true guests, but close friends I would have no problem treating them like family, as in, \u201cclean your shit!\u201d\n\nSounds to me, with 16 years he wasn\u2019t your friend and this might have just been a last straw/excuse.", "Kks. My apologies. That's why I said YTA if it was you. I wasn't certain if it was or not. Sounds like this dude is not a very good friend or feels entitled to your hospitality and your efforts to mother him. Sounds like he is not taking responsibility for himself or respecting your time or your home. If he's going to throw away your friendship because you're asking him to behave like an adult, then you're better off without that kind of friend. He is behaving like an entitled child rather than like a responsible, respectful adult.", "English is actually not my native tongue.      This was how I said it to my friend: \u201c When you\u2019re finished eating, please wash your plate. \u201c \n\nHim: \u201c It\u2019s not my responsibility to wash.   I\u2019m a guest and I was invited.\u201d"]}
