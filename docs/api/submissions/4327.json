Doesn't excuse the behavior, but if she hasn't been diagnosed you two should look into that. \n\nIn the mean time, stop taking on the burden created by her lack of follow through - which is a nicer way of framing her behavior than calling it dishonesty if we give her the benefit of the doubt that she truly planned to do these things. If she says she picked up groceries for dinner, but you get home and she hasn't - don't just go to the store. Have her go to the store. You can also change the way you frame certain questions - instead of \"did you stop for groceries for supper\" ask \"who is responsible for getting groceries for supper tonight, me or you?\". Instead of \"did you you fill up the tank\" ask \"which one of us is going to make sure we have a full tank of gas before we leave for the weekend\". If she says that she will take on the responsibility, leave her to it (even if that means her having to go to the store after you get home or her getting up early to go get gas before your two leave). \n\nTo be clear - this isn't about punishing her or \"teaching her a lesson\" (which are both inappropriate ways to resolve issues with your spouse), this is about letting the natural consequences of her actions play out without you always being a safety net.

I never lie about anything else. I just panicked so much full on shaking etc thinking about the money stuff. It took me 5yrs and going NC with my mum to get a handle on my shit . My husband still has a date every month he sits down and goes through my accounts with me to make sure I'm OK and bills are paid and it's so stressful, he's so kind and understanding and I feel awful.

I mean, you are asking her simple questions and if she just hasn't gotten around to something, I'm not understanding why she doesn't just say that.

She has untreated ADHD and (again) intends to get the task done but gets distracted.  Therapy / medication might help for this.\n3. Combination of 1 and 2 (which is honestly most likely).

A: she works with a professional to unpack the root cause of this behavior and agrees to supplement her responses to important questions with documentation until there\u2019s a treatment plan in place, or B: she takes on 100% of the responsibility for correcting issues that result from her lies.

She's flat out lying to you about little things for some reason.  That would annoy the heck out of me to no end and would put a strain on the relationship.\n\nWhat I see here is a partnership where one person is not being a good teammate.  Your wife can't do the simplest of things that most normal people don't even need to think about.  Things like picking up the groceries, getting gas, taking care of personal property are basic life things that most people don't really put much thought into.\n\nI would not trust her one bit with anything.

Honestly you two should openly talk about this. If she does not change her ways I'm afraid she'll be a constant burden to you which is not a good base for a relationship.

Wanted to chime in as somebody diagnosed with ADHD, as a lot of these verdicts suggest your wife may be suffering unknowingly.\n\nDoes ADHD make you forget stuff? Stop a task partway through? Lose things as you set them down?  Glue you to one spot unless your brain sees dopamine in an activity? Absolutely.\n\nIt DOES NOT pressure you to behave like this, ie saying you have something done to avoid letting somebody down. I agree and can almost guarantee this is a result of some sort of (little t) trauma. Controlling, micromanaging, unpredictable, on-edge caregivers absolutely can lead to this behavior. I saw it in myself before I moved out. I can see it in my youngest sister as she fibs about homework assignments. But I also know that it doesn't stem from the inattention. \n\nMaybe OP's wife does have undiagnosed ADHD. It would certainly explain forgetting to do things. But as OP said, it's not forgetting to do things that's bugging him, it's the avoidance and compulsive lying. That's a deeper-than-medication fix. \n\nOf course, sit down and talk with her, but I do believe therapy will be the most effective course of action here.
