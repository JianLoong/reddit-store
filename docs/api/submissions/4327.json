Yes, OP's wife is saying things that are not true. So she is lying. But that is not really the central issue. OP does not seem to think his wife is generally a dishonest person. As I said, I am giving OP's wife the benefit of the doubt that she truly intends to get these things done. She is not lying to pull one over on her husband or to get out of a chore. Why would she? In the examples OP gives, he is already offering to take on the task. If she doesn't want to do it, all she has to do is accept OP's offer. I very much doubt she is lying purposefully to cause more work for OP. He doesn't seem to think so either.\r  \n\r  \nOP's wife is lying because she wants to take ownership of the task but knows that if it isn't done when OP asks, either he will do it or it will become a whole conversation about when she will do it. This is probably a dynamic that has developed in their relationship because OP has been taking on the burden when his wife has issues with follow through/executive functioning. This has left him feeling stressed, taken advantage, and lied to. And left his wife feeling like a failure who cannot live up to his expectations despite her best intentions. *OP's current solution of verifying everything his wife tells him continues to put all of the burden on him while also continuing to make his wife feel like an failure.* If they both make changes in how they communicate, how they manage the consequences when she doesn't follow through, and if she works on strategies to better manage these tasks, they will both be happier.\r  \n\r  \n*OP's wife is the AH because she is unwilling to acknowledge how her actions (or lack thereof) are impacting her husband and is instead blaming him for his attempt resolve the issue.*\r  \n\r  \nAgain - this is all predicated on my assumption that OP's wife has ADHD and that her intentions are good. She could just be an AH. But OP doesn't seem to think that is the case and neither do I.", "NTA, but honestly, your wife may want to get checked for ADD.", "NTA, but honestly your current strategy doesn't sound sustainable, and is only going to breed further resentment on both sides.

I do not mean to diagnose anyone thirdhand, but meaning to do things and forgetting about them can be a symptom of ADHD.

I never lie about anything else. I just panicked so much full on shaking etc thinking about the money stuff. It took me 5yrs and going NC with my mum to get a handle on my shit . My husband still has a date every month he sits down and goes through my accounts with me to make sure I'm OK and bills are paid and it's so stressful, he's so kind and understanding and I feel awful.

A: she works with a professional to unpack the root cause of this behavior and agrees to supplement her responses to important questions with documentation until there\u2019s a treatment plan in place, or B: she takes on 100% of the responsibility for correcting issues that result from her lies.

Wanted to chime in as somebody diagnosed with ADHD, as a lot of these verdicts suggest your wife may be suffering unknowingly.\n\nDoes ADHD make you forget stuff? Stop a task partway through? Lose things as you set them down?  Glue you to one spot unless your brain sees dopamine in an activity? Absolutely.\n\nIt DOES NOT pressure you to behave like this, ie saying you have something done to avoid letting somebody down. I agree and can almost guarantee this is a result of some sort of (little t) trauma. Controlling, micromanaging, unpredictable, on-edge caregivers absolutely can lead to this behavior. I saw it in myself before I moved out. I can see it in my youngest sister as she fibs about homework assignments. But I also know that it doesn't stem from the inattention. \n\nMaybe OP's wife does have undiagnosed ADHD. It would certainly explain forgetting to do things.

That's a deeper-than-medication fix. \n\nOf course, sit down and talk with her, but I do believe therapy will be the most effective course of action here.

These are all routes that are possible if he expresses how he feels and is affected by the behavior.", "You can Make bed\nPut clothes away\nClean up the baseboards\nVaccum\nWipe down mirrors\n \nin 7.5 minutes?", "It's like you crawled into my head and described things about me I couldn't put into words.", "100% this! What's strange about this entire situation is how OP doesn't seem to engage with the possibility of his wife having ADHD (his replies never actually address the possibility, even when so many ppl insist his wife is a neon case for ADHD). If she does have ADHD, getting a diagnosis would ultimately help both of them, even without pursuing medication/therapy.", "I specifically didn't say that. I said I hadn't heard that before. Which is true. I don't run around hyperactively either, I have inattentive presentation. The only thing I said about me personally was that I hadn't heard that lying was a common thing with adhd, and that it upset me that so many comments said it is. I didn't say it was wrong or untrue, merely that it was news to me. I did say that I wouldn't lie; again I didn't say that because I have adhd and I wouldn't lie, no one else would, just me personally.", "I believe it's a legal issue due to some ADHD medications being controlled substances, and not something that's at the discretion of the pharmacy. My psychiatrist informed me that the flexibility allowed during the pandemic is going away and now I'll have to be seen in person every X months in order to maintain my prescription.", "Yes, as long as I keep up with it. Instead of having to Make bed, put away clothes, clean baseboards, etc etc, it's instead: Make Bed, Vaccum, Wipe down mirrors (Or whatever needs to be done).   \n\n\nAlso I try to have my cleaning supplies set up in a carrier, so I can just grab one thing and go.   \n\n\nThe pre-clean routine: Get cleaning supplies ready, set up music, read over list of what's needed for the day, start timer and start in bathroom (It's the furthest in my apartment), Finish the bathroom move to the next room which would be my bedroom, and continue down the room list.   \n\n\n((This is also excluding the child's room because I have no idea what she does in there or how she's able to summon tornados to destroy her room. ))  \n\n\nNow on bad weeks, weeks that I've dropped the ball and screwed up my system. When I start cleaning what I'll do is every X hours (Usually 2 for me), Do another 15-minute clean down the list to catch up on what I stopped taking care of.    \n\n\nThe one issue that I did have starting this system; was making the list of what to do in each room. Although for that I found different types of apps to help like Unfuck your house, and a few other things that gave a cookie cutter list.", "Ok but you specifically responded that way to a comment that said it was a common sign. It seems now like you didn\u2019t mean for it to come across the way it did, but it kinda came across like because *you* have never lied in those situations that you don\u2019t believe it is a common sign. But again, seems like you didn\u2019t mean for it to take that tone, so I get it now.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why it would upset you, tho? Just because it\u2019s a presentation for others doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t have any bearing on you", "Yeah, apologies. I'm recovering from surgery, the brain fog is real. It upset me because I'm so fed up with NT people assuming they know what ADHD does or doesn't entail, and the idea that lying is that common a symptom that everyone seems to know about it, just hit me like, maybe people assume that about me then? The idea that people may assume I'm lying because I have ADHD, is distressing. I'm probably not articulating myself well. I'm quite impressed I'm managing to type coherently at all."]}
