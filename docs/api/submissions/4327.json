Doesn't excuse the behavior, but if she hasn't been diagnosed you two should look into that. \n\nIn the mean time, stop taking on the burden created by her lack of follow through - which is a nicer way of framing her behavior than calling it dishonesty if we give her the benefit of the doubt that she truly planned to do these things. If she says she picked up groceries for dinner, but you get home and she hasn't - don't just go to the store. Have her go to the store. You can also change the way you frame certain questions - instead of \"did you stop for groceries for supper\" ask \"who is responsible for getting groceries for supper tonight, me or you?\". Instead of \"did you you fill up the tank\" ask \"which one of us is going to make sure we have a full tank of gas before we leave for the weekend\". If she says that she will take on the responsibility, leave her to it (even if that means her having to go to the store after you get home or her getting up early to go get gas before your two leave). \n\nTo be clear - this isn't about punishing her or \"teaching her a lesson\" (which are both inappropriate ways to resolve issues with your spouse), this is about letting the natural consequences of her actions play out without you always being a safety net.

I do not mean to diagnose anyone thirdhand, but meaning to do things and forgetting about them can be a symptom of ADHD.

When I was young I grew up seeing my mum scream at my dad whenever they did the accounts together, like loose her shit constantly if he put the wrong amount in or if he spent money for himself or if he ever bought her anything she would hound him for the receipt etc  real financial abuse. \nSo for ages my husband would be so confused why I was hiding money I spent, or always over drawn etc and I would lie about it. I never lie about anything else. I just panicked so much full on shaking etc thinking about the money stuff. It took me 5yrs and going NC with my mum to get a handle on my shit . My husband still has a date every month he sits down and goes through my accounts with me to make sure I'm OK and bills are paid and it's so stressful, he's so kind and understanding and I feel awful. But I don't lie anymore. \nSo could it be something like that? A lot of people won't understand it.

So you learn to say things like, yep, I did it, or I'll get to it right now.

Although these seem to be white lies with good intentions, it sounds like she may have some underlying issues because intending to do something and doing them are not the same.  There really is no reason to say you did something if you haven't done it yet, regardless of the intention to do it.  I mean, you are asking her simple questions and if she just hasn't gotten around to something, I'm not understanding why she doesn't just say that.  I'm not sure if some kind of therapy would help her, but that may be something to suggest or maybe something as simple as writing a list and marking it off when it's actually done would help her.", "This sounds like one of three things -\n\n1. She was raised to be a \"people pleaser\".

Instead of asking her \"Did you get the groceries?\" or \"Did you fill the gas tank?\" Tell her \"I need you to get the groceries, please.\" or \"Please fill the gas tank.\" Yes, it's going to sound like you're always telling her what to do, but it removes the opportunity to lie about it.\n2. She has untreated ADHD and (again) intends to get the task done but gets distracted.  Therapy / medication might help for this.\n3. Combination of 1 and 2 (which is honestly most likely).  The first causes her to lie, the second causes her to get distracted and thus the task never gets completed.", "NTA but how is this sustainable?

It exists now. \n\nI\u2019d offer her option A and option B. A: she works with a professional to unpack the root cause of this behavior and agrees to supplement her responses to important questions with documentation until there\u2019s a treatment plan in place, or B: she takes on 100% of the responsibility for correcting issues that result from her lies. Broken phone? She lives with it or replace it from her fun money pool, not the family\u2019s. Lied about groceries? She drops what she\u2019s doing and goes out to get them, not you.", "NTA.

It's not an excuse, but it would probably explain what is motivating her to act so irrationally.", "Probably  not helpful but...\n\nThere is significant  research  that for MANY  people saying something outloud translates in their brain as actually  doing it.\n\nMaybe you ask her to text her when a task is done?\n\nAsking may reinforce the flawed thinking.", "NTA\n\nShe has proven you cannot trust her word, so she has nothing to complain about.", "NTA- she\u2019s mad you can\u2019t trust her but that\u2019s because\u2026.YOU CANT TRUST HER\u2026.like if she wants you to trust her she should stop lying \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This sounds like ADHD to be completely honest. Just something I've seen myself do, and a lot of others. \n\nI doubt it's that she's lying per se, she just says it's taken care of, fully intending to do it then forgets. The result is the same, but she's not trying to deceive you which is an important distinction. It sounds more like executive dysfunction. (Which isn't necessarily ADHD, just an associate's symptom)\n\nIf that's the root of the issue it might be something you can overcome if she can work out some coping mechanisms, or talk to a professional.\n\nMy dad can also be like this, but he's become very good at working out lists to check off so he can stay on track.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nWhat I see here is you not trusting your wife and you have good reason for it.  She's flat out lying to you about little things for some reason.  That would annoy the heck out of me to no end and would put a strain on the relationship.\n\nWhat I see here is a partnership where one person is not being a good teammate.  Your wife can't do the simplest of things that most normal people don't even need to think about.  Things like picking up the groceries, getting gas, taking care of personal property are basic life things that most people don't really put much thought into.\n\nI would not trust her one bit with anything.  I don't know why you'd want to start a family with her.  I would not trust her to be a good mother due to her forgetfulness and her lying about it. Does she have some sort of condition? None of this is normal and indicates that she might be suffering from something.  It's either that or she's honestly just lazy and a liar.", "NTA - Although I don't think demanding proof for everything she does is a solution I understand where you are coming from. Have you tried asking her why she does not tell you the truth? Do you get mad at her if she forgets something? Maybe she feels insecure? Maybe she's just lazy or doesn't like responsibility? Honestly you two should openly talk about this. If she does not change her ways I'm afraid she'll be a constant burden to you which is not a good base for a relationship. She needs to be honest with you, these are relatively small things but small things can escalate.", "NTA and insist she get professional help to work through why she does it and how to stop doing it before you have kids with her because that kind of behavior could end up hurting a child.", "NTA, but this sounds deeply exhausting.  Even if she\u2019s got some kind of executive function issue, she needs to go get tested so she can actually see someone about putting a treatment plan into action.  \n\nI think you need to be clear with her that trust is earned, and the fact that things having come to this point *still* hasn\u2019t curbed her tendency to give the answer she thinks you want and then walk it back or make excuses when called on not following through is deeply concerning.  So either she gets help figuring out why she does this, or you\u2019ve got some thinking to do about where this partnership goes from here.", "Info: why do you want to have a family with someone you don\u2019t even trust?", "Info: do you think she might have ADD?

Wanted to chime in as somebody diagnosed with ADHD, as a lot of these verdicts suggest your wife may be suffering unknowingly.\n\nDoes ADHD make you forget stuff? Stop a task partway through? Lose things as you set them down?  Glue you to one spot unless your brain sees dopamine in an activity? Absolutely.\n\nIt DOES NOT pressure you to behave like this, ie saying you have something done to avoid letting somebody down. I agree and can almost guarantee this is a result of some sort of (little t) trauma. Controlling, micromanaging, unpredictable, on-edge caregivers absolutely can lead to this behavior. I saw it in myself before I moved out. I can see it in my youngest sister as she fibs about homework assignments. But I also know that it doesn't stem from the inattention. \n\nMaybe OP's wife does have undiagnosed ADHD. It would certainly explain forgetting to do things. But as OP said, it's not forgetting to do things that's bugging him, it's the avoidance and compulsive lying. That's a deeper-than-medication fix. \n\nOf course, sit down and talk with her, but I do believe therapy will be the most effective course of action here. You would not be remiss to continuing verifying information until she proves otherwise; I hope she understands soon that the double-checking is not out of mockery or malice, but genuine concern and wanting proper communication despite how her brain may be responding to the situation.", "You sure you wanna have kids with this woman? \n\nNTA - she needs to get her shit together", "NTA.

This, to me, seems more like your wife has a really bad communication style rather than intentional untrustworthiness. She's communicating her intention to do something before you return as if she's already done it. On top of that, she also seems fairly forgetful, so she often doesn't follow through on her intentions. That's a big issue, and is having a major impact on you. \n\nHowever, I think some of your statements ('chooses to lie' and 'not being truthful') are character judgments about your wife. The events themselves seem to indicate that your wife has a poor communication style (communicating intention to complete as already completed) rather than a problem with dishonesty. \n\nYou two really, really need to work on this, and your wife does need to change how she communicates because it's impacting you significantly.

But, to be honest, it sounds like she has had no real motivation to change her behavior because you clean up the mess for her. She lies about shopping so you go do it for her.

My mom always had her thumb on me and was emotionally, verbally, sometimes even physically abusive if she wasn't happy.  So it became self-preservation to be an appeaser, to tell her what she wanted to hear.  It didn't FEEL like lying, it felt like self-preservation.  And although I don't habitually appease the people I live with now, I'm sure there are times in the past where I have.
