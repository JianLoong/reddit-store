This weekend is his weekend with our son. We both live in NYC, but he lives in the Bronx and I live in queens.  Everything my son does is in queens. School, tutoring and extra curriculars. His dad has been complaining that he has to come to queens and pay tolls. Recently my son has soccer on Saturdays, and his dad picks him up on Friday after school on his weekends. He complained that he doesn't want to travel to queens 3 times during the weekends he has that to take our son for soccer. I told him that if he didn't want to take him to soccer, that will have to be a decision he has to make.  I reached out to him on Friday, and asked if he was going to take him, and no response. The soccer school offers make up classes on Sunday, and wouldn't mind taking him Saturday and Sunday on my weekends.  \n\nToday, I reach out to my son on a 3 way call with my mother, and My mom asks him if he went to soccer Saturday. He says no because his dad was having car issues. He says his check engine light came on and his car was wasting a lot of gas. I already had the thought of picking him up today just for a courtesy. His dad tells me \" my car has issues, you're gonna have to come and pick him up\". Something about someone telling you what to do when you already planned to do it just sets me off more. I said okay no problem. \n\nHe reaches out to me and tells me to come at around 7pm so he can give dinner to our son and he can watch a movie. Cool. But whay sets me off is that he gives me the address to his girlfriends house in city island. He lives with his parents in the bronx. To get to city island is like traveling to another island from another city. It's inconvenient and it's raining. Annoyed I tell him that for someone who has car issues, he went to city island, and I showed him a screen shot on life 360 app of our son moving from his grandparents location to city island. I told either he goes back to his parents house for me to pick him up or he drops him off at school tomorrow.  He claimed I was being a bitch and was crying. I for one don't think it's fair to ME. \n\nHe wanted to put an ultimatium earlier that I needed to pick up my son from the bronx every other Sundays or if not he was going to drop him off at school Monday if I don't come. He claims he's not coming to queens. I said I don't care, it's the same thing, you will have to come to queens anyways. He appears to have felt dumb, and didn't respond either. \n\nHe doesn't pay child support, pay for extra curricular activities, and only paid for tutoring once.  I'm basically the one who helps with homework, pay all of our sons expenses, take him to school, and buys him his necessities. I don't find it fair that I need to overextend myself more when I'm basically the one doing everything.\n\nAnyways, AITA for refusing?", "created_utc": 1702241264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fczk1/aita_for_refusing_to_pick_up_my_son_from_his_dads/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He then expected that I would drive to pick her up after his visits.  It's in our parenting plan that we meet in our origin city.  He then tried to tell my 3-year-old (at the time) that \"Mommy didn't want to get her.\"  That happened once.  He got a new asshole torn into him, and we never had to have that conversation again.  We dropped/picked up at the same point until her 18th birthday.  My daughter is 21 now. She visits her grandparents and only sees him there.  He wonders why.", "ESH - okay, so he sounds like he\u2019s an an AH for plenty of reasons. But, you do need to pick up your kid, right? Like, you\u2019re using your kid as a pawn bc your ex is an AH.", "YTA. You signed your son up for something that he has to miss because if his dad.

He came up with every other weekend and for every other holiday.  I never agreed to having to pick our son up, I only agreed at times if there is an issue. \n\nBefore people start coming at me about the whole court situation, he wasn't around when I was pregnant, and also he would come and visit my son whenever he liked. If we had gotten into an argument regarding our son and he wanted to be petty, he would put a petition in court. He went and told the judge he wanted me to have full custody. After he took me to court and wasted my time. With him wanting to put himself on the birth certificate, he was put on child support. \n\nI went to child support and informed them he wasn't paying, he had to pay back child support. And he continues to pull the same stunt.  \n\nIn the summer when our son was in his care, I was going to and coming from to pick him up every other weekend at his girlfriends house. I didn't have an issue. I made the commitment because it was MY visitation and time I wanted to spend with my son.\n\nI dont have an issue with picking him up, but don't claim you have car issues, and you drove to your girlfriends house with our kid. You can drive over there you can also drive back to drop him off.", "This. You demonstrate to the child how important they are to you.  The child will formulate their own opinion on the parents by the parents\u2019 actions.", "If the agreement is for him to pick up and drop off the kid then mom doesn\u2019t have to do it.

Better for the kids to miss a day of school than to have him continue visitation with a parent who refuses to parent."]}
