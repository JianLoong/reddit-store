He then takes audience members names to give examples and says things like, \"Your shoes are ugly\" or, \"I can see you breathing.\"\n\nIf kids are going to bully it doesn't matter what your child's name is. If they're just playing around, ffs your kid should have the mental health to learn their name was once used by an author for a character in a book!\n\nETA: Harry Potter isn't the phenomenon with today's youth it was 20 years ago.

My siblings were born in 1998 and 2000 and half their friends never read them or saw the movies, or maybe did once, and interest in them has really only decreased. It's not like naming a kid Severus. And older names are coming back into fashion. Neville is fine. If kids want to make fun of someone's name, they'll find a way to do it even if it's, like, Katie Elizabeth Smith.", "Lol... I'm so old I just thought of Neville Chamberlain", "that can be done with any name though.", "Upvote for the iranier yoghurt reference, it's been a while since I've seen it", "That reference is familiar", "Well it hasn\u2019t come to that.

It's not my idea of the best name ever, but it's a regular ass name nothing crazy. \n\nOP is TAH because he's flipping his shit over an uncommon but not outlandish name.
