This is a WIBTA, but I would be logging my work iPad out of social media, which is the only device connected to our social media, to prove a point to my boss that she needs to pay better attention to her business because she doesn\u2019t know the login and this is the only device connected to it.\n\n2. I\u2019m most likely the asshole because this would inconvenience the business, and I\u2019m aware of that.

That's never a good move.  Job hunting however, would be a great move given how you are feeling.  Clearly you resent your boss for being less qualified than you to keep certain things working. That's kind of the point of you being paid.  You were hired to do those things because your Boss cannot.  There are no justified assholes.  There are only assholes.  Don't be either.  YTA", "**YTA-** Look OP, this woman is desperate to crash and burn, and I don't think she needs your help to do so. \n\nHonestly, you should quit or find another job and let nature take its course. You can't teach people who don't want to learn.", "YTA for not quitting the job in the first place.", "YTA, *specifically* concerning logging out on the social media to teach her a lesson. She's the boss, she can run the store as badly as she wants. Plus I doubt she would learn anything. I really have to ask, why do you care? You describe her as a rather horrible boss. The paycheck thing should be reported to the labor board (or your countries equivalent), and she deserves an ahole rating for that. Sometimes you just can't afford to quit, but why try to improve the place?", "YWBTA.  She seems to be crashing quickly on her own.  Find another job.", "If she doesn't pay you in a timely manner, contact the department of labor.", "Is she the owner, or just a manager? Have you brought any if these very serious complaints to the owner? Honestly, logging out of the Instagram account will not teach her anything. She\u2019ll probably just complain to you about weekly. Just look for another job and get out of that mess. NTA, but it won\u2019t work like you think it will.", "YTA & I don\u2019t actually see how it would be justified in any way?\n\nQuit & leave. Sabotaging anything makes you an A", "Yes YWBTA YTA and no it isn't justified\n\nIf you don't like the boss owner, find a new job. They're not gonna listen to you and purposefully sabatoging the company isn't the cute look you think it is.", "YTA. Your boss asked you to post more to social media. Dunno why you need to use your personal phone to do it. Just take a few mediocre pics with the provided iPad and call it a day rather than resorting to sabotage. \n\nI forget logins all the time. You just reset from email, so the \"point\" you're making won't be made anyway.", "You need to stick up for yourself and get a better job. WTF is wrong with you?!", "NTA. There is zero reason for her to expect you to have her company\u2019s social media on your personal device. You don\u2019t need the ploy either- just flat out tell her no and write down the login info or text it to her and delete it. Hope you\u2019re looking for another job cause no one should have to deal with any of the crap you do.", "YWBTA - What you're considering doing is potentially illegal, as your intentionally removing access to the store's account, on the stores device; Basically you'd be committing sabotage.  I doubt you'd get arrested or charged with anything as it's a bit of a stretch, although admitting to it online before doing so would probably make that  a tad more likely.\n\nFind a new job, and let the inevitable happen naturally.", "YWBTA, but it'd be worth it.\n\nU would absolutely do it AND I'd be ok with being the asshole.\n\nAlso work on your boundaries more. I'm not cleaning up after somebody's pet unless I'm employed specifically not to. If she threatens to fire you, so what? There's probably a lot of jobs around at the same pay.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
